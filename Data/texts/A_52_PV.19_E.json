(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker is the Deputy\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam, His Excellency\r\nMr. Vu Khoan.\r\nMr. Vu Khoan (Viet Nam): On behalf of the\r\nVietnamese delegation, I wish to warmly congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am confident that under\r\nyour wise guidance this session will be crowned with many\r\nfine results.\r\nI should like also to express the appreciation of the\r\nVietnamese delegation for the active work done by\r\nMr. Razali Ismail, President of the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, a session that marked new strides on the\r\nUnited Nations journey to fulfil its mandate in contributing\r\nto peace and development in the world as a whole.\r\nMay I take this opportunity to warmly congratulate\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, within a very short span of time\r\nsince assuming the very important post of Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, has managed to accomplish\r\na large amount of work, including efforts related to reform\r\nof the United Nations in the light of the profound changes\r\nin the world, in response to the aspirations of peoples with\r\nregard to our global Organization.\r\nMankind is rushing towards the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury and preparing to enter the third millennium with\r\nan earnest desire for a more tranquil and better life. That\r\ndesire becomes even more earnest when we look back at\r\nthe last century, a century that has been darkened by the\r\nblack clouds of two world wars and countless conflicts,\r\nlarge and small. That desire becomes even more urgent\r\ngiven that the boundless mind of man has produced\r\nnumerous miraculous inventions, opening up a new era\r\ncalled the “post-industrial era” or “the information age”,\r\nwhile more than a quarter of the developing world’s\r\npopulation still lives in poverty, some 840 million go\r\nhungry or face food insecurity, and even in industrial\r\ncountries more than 100 million people live below the\r\npoverty line and 37 million are jobless.\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is understandable that\r\nall nations see the need to consolidate peace and promote\r\ndevelopment as their primary priority so as to turn the\r\ntwenty-first century into a century with fewer conflicts\r\nand less poverty.\r\nPeace and development are companions; they go\r\ntogether like the two sides of a coin. Sustainable\r\ndevelopment is only possible if it is built upon the solid\r\npremise of a durable peace: peace for all nations, peace\r\nfor every region and peace for the entire planet. Here, we\r\nfully subscribe to the views expressed in the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment: development is a prerequisite for peace,\r\nand at the same time peace is a precondition for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nWe may take satisfaction from the fact that, during the\r\npast year, a series of events have shown that the trend\r\ntowards peace is continuing. Political solutions have been\r\nfound for a number of decades-old conflicts. Relations\r\nbetween various nations, including the big Powers, have\r\nseen some partial improvements. Following in the footsteps\r\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention (CWC) entered into force.\r\nThe South-East Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone\r\n(SEANWFZ) has come into existence.\r\nIn spite of all this, the world’s people still cannot be\r\nassured of a lasting peace if that peace is not constructed\r\non an equitable premise. It is truly unfair that a few\r\ncountries are entitled to maintain an absolute superiority,\r\nwhich even enables them to use their power to impose their\r\nwill on other countries, while many countries have to live\r\nin the fear of insecurity. In this context, we hold that there\r\nis still a need to free our planet from the burden of nuclear\r\nweapons, to ban, totally and resolutely, the production,\r\nstorage, threat and use of this most horrible and lethal type\r\nof weapon. In the same context, we expect the nuclear-\r\nweapon States to sign the protocol annexed to the\r\nSEANWFZ soon, in order to strengthen the power of the\r\nTreaty, thereby making a viable contribution to peace and\r\nstability in South-East Asia.\r\nOur world cannot have peace when conflicts are still\r\nraging in various parts of our planet. Today, the Middle\r\nEast is again raising the deep concern of everyone. We\r\nshare the position that tremendous efforts are needed to\r\nlead us to a durable and lasting peace for that region, which\r\nhas suffered too much and too long. Such a peace can be\r\nachieved only on the basis of ensuring the safety of the\r\nnations living in this region, respecting the fundamental\r\nrights of the Palestinian people, including the right to\r\nestablish an independent Palestinian State, and, most\r\nimmediately, the strict implementation of the United\r\nNations resolutions and the principles of the Madrid\r\nConference, as well as the accords that have been\r\nconcluded.\r\nIn Asia and the Pacific in general and in South-East\r\nAsia in particular, where, fortunately, stability is on the\r\nrise, incremental efforts are being made to render this trend\r\nmore durable. As a country bordering Cambodia, we give\r\ngreat attention to the situation in that neighbouring nation.\r\nOur position on the Cambodian question is clear to all: in\r\nconformity with our general foreign policy, we persevere in\r\nupholding the principle of full respect for the independence\r\nand sovereignty of nations and the principle that the affairs\r\nof a country must be decided by the people of that country\r\nitself, free from foreign interference. At the same time,\r\nfrom the bottom of our heart, we wish the Cambodian\r\npeople peace and stability so that they can reconstruct a\r\nprosperous country in their homeland. We sincerely wish\r\nto tirelessly foster relations of friendship and cooperation\r\nwith the Kingdom of Cambodia.\r\nBordering the South China Sea, which we call the\r\nEastern Sea, Viet Nam has always considered that\r\ndisputes there should be settled by negotiation on the\r\nbasis of international law, particularly the 1982 United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, with a view\r\nto achieving a sustainable and lasting solution. For the\r\ntime being, it is necessary to preserve the status quo,\r\nexert self-restraint and abstain from acts that may further\r\ncompound the situation and prejudice the stability of the\r\nregion and the safety of international maritime navigation.\r\nAt the same time, we should seek cooperation measures\r\nacceptable to the parties concerned. We share the\r\nsatisfaction at the recent positive developments related to\r\nthe situation in the Korean peninsula, and it is our wish\r\nthat these developments will lead to a durable peace in\r\nthis very sensitive part of our world.\r\nAlthough peace is the most important condition for\r\ndevelopment, peace alone, without cooperation among\r\nStates on the basis of equality and mutual respect and\r\nbenefits, is not adequate. Today, in a world of ever-\r\ndeepening interdependence, and under the impact of\r\nglobalization and regionalization trends, the need for\r\ndevelopment cooperation is increasingly strong.\r\nIt is obvious that nations are facing unprecedented\r\nopportunities for expanding markets, engaging more\r\npartners and intensifying investment and technology\r\ntransfers in order to attain higher growth. Besides this,\r\nthere is a rather stark reality, especially for developing\r\ncountries: the process of liberalization has made\r\ncompetition extremely acute, and in that competition the\r\nadvantages do not go to countries which, due to certain\r\ncircumstances, are still at a low level of economic\r\ndevelopment. It is therefore no surprise that the gap\r\nbetween the rich and poor countries is widening, causing\r\ngreat losses to developing nations.\r\nThat situation gives the international community two\r\nchoices: either to let things go on, which will cause a\r\nmore serious crisis, affecting the global economic and\r\npolitical situation; or to cooperate for shared development.\r\nIn our humble opinion, the first scenario is not beneficial\r\nto anybody, while the latter brings about benefit for everybody.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nWith that perception, we are of the view that it is\r\nnecessary to reverse the trend of decreasing official\r\ndevelopment assistance, both bilaterally and multilaterally.\r\nWith that perception, we look forward to stronger\r\ntechnology transfers, because outstanding and rapid\r\nscientific and technological progress is presenting a danger\r\nof developing countries being left further behind.\r\nWith that perception, we would like to emphasize the\r\nneed to set up reasonable trade terms, taking into account\r\nthe difficulties faced by developing countries, and to ensure\r\nthat the developed countries broaden market access for\r\ncommodities from the developing countries.\r\nWith that perception, we believe that it is high time to\r\ncompletely do away with the obsolete ways of thinking and\r\nacting of the past, namely, the imposition of inequitable\r\nterms of economic and trade relations, sanctions and\r\nembargoes, and so forth, which distort international\r\nrelations, cause suffering to the people and seriously violate\r\nthe minimum right of human beings — the right to a\r\npeaceful life.\r\nUnder the general circumstances of our world today,\r\nthe need to reform the United Nations has become more\r\nand more imperative. We share many of the ideas that the\r\nSecretary-General has put forth. In our opinion, besides its\r\ncontribution to the maintenance of peace, the promotion of\r\nequitable international cooperation — a top priority on the\r\nagenda of the United Nations — must mean more vigorous\r\nassistance to development. We offer our strong support for\r\nthe ideas stated in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\n“Renewing the United Nations: a programme for reform”\r\n(A/51/950), which particularly underlined that the\r\npromotion of economic development and development\r\ncooperation was the primary mandate and function of the\r\nUnited Nations. It is our hope that countries, especially the\r\ndeveloped ones, will enhance their contribution to the\r\ndevelopment programmes of the United Nations.\r\nOn this occasion, I wish to express our high\r\nappreciation to the institutions of the United Nations system\r\nfor the assistance extended to Viet Nam, especially for our\r\neconomic renovation to implement social programmes of\r\npoverty alleviation, health care and education development,\r\nand international integration. The commitment to further\r\nenhance the efficiency of the partnership between Viet Nam\r\nand the United Nations development system was made by\r\nthe two partners at the conference to review 20 years of\r\nViet Nam-United Nations cooperation, which took place\r\nrecently in Hanoi.\r\nWith regard to the United Nations structure, our\r\nconsistent view is that it should reflect the fundamental\r\nchanges that have been taking place during the last half-\r\ncentury or more, the most notable highlight of which is\r\nthat over 100 independent States have joined the United\r\nNations. Its organizational structure and working\r\nprocedures could be more democratized. The stature of\r\ndeveloping countries needs to be strongly enhanced,\r\nincluding in the Security Council, and at the same time,\r\nthe role of the General Assembly should be further\r\nstrengthened. Along those lines, we share the view that it\r\nis necessary to increase the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, both permanent and non-permanent categories,\r\nwith a satisfactory number of seats given to developing\r\ncountries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and to\r\nensure that every Member assumes similar responsibilities\r\nand rights. We believe that in order to work out a\r\ncomprehensive programme for United Nations reform a\r\nCommittee of the Whole should be established.\r\nThe National Assembly of Viet Nam has just held\r\nthe first session of its tenth term in Hanoi to elect the\r\nhighest dignitaries of our State and approve the list of\r\nnew government members, thus realizing important\r\ncontinuity of generations of leadership. This National\r\nAssembly is of special significance, as it will lead our\r\ncountry into the twenty-first century on the road of all-\r\nround renovation to attain the goal of “Wealthy people,\r\nstrong country, just and civilized society”, through the\r\nprocess of national industrialization and modernization, in\r\norder to turn Viet Nam into a basically industrialized\r\nState by the year 2020.\r\nIn its foreign relations, Viet Nam will constantly\r\npursue an open foreign policy of independence,\r\ndiversification and the promotion of multilateral relations\r\nalong the line of gradual regional and international\r\nintegration, thus making worthy contributions to the cause\r\nof peace, national independence, democracy and social\r\nprogress. In line with this policy, Viet Nam will continue\r\nto stand as an active Member of the United Nations and\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. In line with this policy, Viet\r\nNam is making constructive contributions to the\r\nintensification of cooperation within the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and is actively\r\npreparing the sixth ASEAN Summit to be held in Hanoi\r\nat the end of next year. In line with this policy, Viet Nam\r\nis competing with time to ensure the successful\r\norganization of the forthcoming seventh summit of\r\nFrench-speaking community in Hanoi. In line with this\r\npolicy, Viet Nam is sparing no effort in making practical\r\npreparations to participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nCooperation Council and the World Trade Organization.\r\nAlso in line with this policy, Viet Nam wishes to become\r\na member of the United Nations Economic and Social\r\nCouncil at the elections to be held at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that this reasonable\r\nwish of ours will meet with the generous support of\r\nMember countries.\r\nAs we strive for the noble aspirations of peace and\r\ndevelopment on the eve of the new century, countries in the\r\ninternational community will continue to find in Viet Nam\r\na sincere friend and constructive companion. On our part,\r\nwe expect that United Nations activities will be ever more\r\neffective in enabling all countries to work for shared\r\ndevelopment in peace and partnership.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Bangladesh, His Excellency Mr. Abdus Samad\r\nAzad.\r\nMr. Azad (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bengali; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): It affords me great\r\npleasure and honour to convey to you, Mr. President, on\r\nbehalf of my delegation, as well as on my own behalf, our\r\nheartiest congratulations on your unanimous election. It is\r\na fitting tribute not only to your outstanding diplomatic\r\nskills and long involvement with the United Nations, but\r\nalso to your country, with which we enjoy friendly\r\nrelations.\r\nTo your predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of\r\nMalaysia, I should like to express our sincere appreciation\r\nfor the remarkable job that he did. His was an\r\nextraordinarily proactive presidency. Indeed, he has given\r\nnew stature to the office of President of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThis is the first regular session of the General\r\nAssembly for our Secretary-General Kofi Annan since his\r\nappointment to that high office. In the discharge of his very\r\nonerous responsibilities he brings to bear unmatched\r\nexpertise with regard to the United Nations system. Indeed,\r\nhe is the archetypical insider of that system. His\r\nappointment to the highest Secretariat position is\r\nrecognition of his manifest competence. The priority that he\r\nhas attached to the task of making the United Nations\r\nsystem more streamlined and attuned to present-day\r\nrealities and requirements is indeed commendable.\r\nWhile on the subject of reform, let me say that my\r\ndelegation lends its full support to the initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General in submitting his reform proposal, which\r\nthe Assembly will be examining later in the course of its\r\nbusiness. There is no denying that the proposal is timely\r\nand that it has been put forward to make the United\r\nNations more efficient and effective. We expect that the\r\nreform process will preserve and promote the centrality\r\nand sanctity of the principles and objectives of the United\r\nNations Charter. My delegation also wants the process of\r\nreform to be carried out with the primary objective of\r\nstrengthening the capacity of the Organization to address\r\nissues of development. Bangladesh would favour\r\nnegotiating the reform package in informal plenary\r\nmeetings with the full participation of all countries.\r\nThe United Nations Charter is of enduring validity.\r\nBy definition, reform has to be a dynamic and periodic\r\nprocess as times, problems and priorities change. My\r\ndelegation would fully support any endeavour to improve\r\nthe administration and management of the United Nations.\r\nMember States have the right and even the duty to insist\r\nthat optimal use be made of the resources that they have\r\nentrusted to the Organization for the promotion of the\r\nCharter objectives. Bangladesh assures its unstinted\r\ncooperation and support to eliminate duplication and\r\noverlap and to effect better coordination and prioritization.\r\nHowever, reform cannot be an acceptable surrogate for\r\npolitical will, and those two aspects must be mutually\r\nsupportive and reinforcing.\r\nIn the context of the reform exercise, Bangladesh\r\nwould like to stress that the exclusively international\r\ncharacter of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General\r\nand his staff should in no way be compromised.\r\nAccording to Article 101 of the Charter, the highest\r\nstandards of efficiency, competence and integrity should\r\nbe the basic determinants in making appointments to the\r\nSecretariat, with due regard to geographical distribution.\r\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary General’s proposal\r\nto submit a code of conduct for international civil\r\nservants.\r\nNo endeavour at United Nations reform will be\r\nsuccessful without the necessary financial resources. The\r\ncontinuation of the current financial crisis of the United\r\nNations has seriously impaired the functioning of the\r\nOrganization. For a financially sick United Nations, the\r\nmuch needed shot in the arm can come only from the full\r\nand unconditional payment of outstanding contributions\r\nby those Member States that have not yet done so.\r\nThe cold-war era of adversarial alliances, power\r\nblocs and ideological divides is happily a thing of the\r\npast. However, another war, one in which the United\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nNations will have to be in the vanguard, remains to be\r\nfought and won before a meaningful peace and international\r\nsecurity can be achieved. That is the war against poverty,\r\nignorance and prejudice.\r\nPeace does not simply happen or come about\r\nfortuitously. It must be sedulously built and nurtured and\r\nunderpinned by a host of interrelated actions that are\r\ninextricably linked to development and human security. A\r\nculture of peace is essential to make it sustainable and all\r\nembracing. Over the years, the concept of security has\r\nevolved, as has the concept of development. The United\r\nNations can be, as the President of the General Assembly\r\nput it last year, the main development catalyst, one that can\r\nstrongly influence coordination at the macro level with\r\nother bodies that have more access to resources but that are\r\nless democratically set up.\r\nWe have been discussing for the past few years the\r\nquestion of Security Council expansion and reform. There\r\nis a clear logic and rationale for an expansion of the overall\r\nsize of the Council to make it more representative in\r\ncharacter. On this aspect of the question a general\r\nconsensus seems to have emerged, although there exist\r\ndifferences as to the exact size of any new Council. Where\r\na convergence of view — let alone consensus — continues\r\nto elude us is on the question of the expansion of the\r\nnumber of permanent seats. Bangladesh’s concern, which\r\nwe have already articulated, is that, in any enlargement\r\nexercise, the concerns of the smaller and more vulnerable\r\nStates that have the most vital stake in an effective and\r\ndynamic United Nations should not be lost sight of.\r\nIn the decade of the 1990s we have had a series of\r\nhigh-profile global conferences. These mega-conferences\r\nhave addressed some of the major challenges that are\r\nconfronting us today and, with the United Nations playing\r\na central role, reached important political consensus. Those\r\ngatherings underscored in particular the primacy of human\r\ndevelopment in achieving sustained and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Agenda for Development adopted in June this\r\nyear is in a sense the culmination of this series,\r\nrepresenting a synthesis of the plans and programmes of\r\naction that had been adopted. The Agenda is the result of\r\ntortuous and painstaking negotiations carried out over a\r\nperiod of four years. It is a matter of gratification to have\r\nachieved a development consensus that was so badly\r\nneeded and clearly warranted. It is, of course, most vital\r\nthat, along with the Agenda for Development, follow-up\r\nand implementation should match the outcome of these\r\nconferences.\r\nBangladesh believes that without the full\r\ninvolvement of civil society this process will remain\r\nincomplete. Recognizing the key role of civil society in\r\npromoting global partnership, we welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal for a people’s millennium Assembly\r\nin the year 2000.\r\nIt is now widely accepted that free enterprise, the\r\nmarket economy, international trade and competition, as\r\nwell as broad-based public participation in economic\r\nexpansion, are the keys to economic growth and human\r\ndevelopment. To this mix must be added the components\r\nof democracy, good governance and the rule of law. This,\r\nhowever, in no way diminishes, particularly in the case of\r\nthe least developed countries, the imperative of a\r\nsupportive external environment. Improved access to\r\nworld markets, greater inflow of foreign private\r\ninvestment, transfer of technology and managerial know-\r\nhow and larger external assistance all have very important\r\nroles to play in ensuring development. Economic\r\nliberalization should invariably be combined, in our view,\r\nwith adequate social safety nets to safeguard the most\r\nvulnerable segments of society.\r\nIt is a matter of some concern to us that global\r\nofficial development assistance flows continue to slump.\r\nWe sincerely hope, though, that this trend will be\r\nreversed. The development of the South is not only an\r\ninvestment in peace and security, but would clearly also\r\nrebound to the advantage of the countries of the North in\r\nthe long and not so long run, since this would mean\r\nbigger markets for their exports, with all their\r\nconcomitant benefits. Development has been most aptly\r\ndescribed as a partnership.\r\nThe plight of the least developed countries, in\r\nparticular, calls for very careful consideration and has in\r\nthe past merited a special place and focus in the\r\ninternational agenda. Two major international conferences\r\non the least developed countries have been held in the\r\n1980s and 1990s and important decisions and programmes\r\nof action adopted. The implementation of these, however,\r\nhas been disappointing. We hope that the third United\r\nNations Conference on the least developed countries can\r\nbe held in the year 2000 to chart the course of global\r\nsupport for these weakest members at the start of next\r\nmillennium.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nWe would urge special consideration and concessions\r\nfor the least developed countries in order to enable them to\r\nmeet World Trade Organization deadlines. Indeed, if the\r\nsituation so warrants, deadlines may even be made flexible\r\nfor that group of countries. We would also urge that, at the\r\nforthcoming high-level meeting in Geneva next month, all\r\nmajor issues of concern to the least developed countries,\r\nincluding duty-free access of their products to foreign\r\nmarkets, be given most favourable consideration.\r\nThe end of cold war perhaps naturally raised our\r\nhopes for a new and exciting world order in which nations\r\nwould share the responsibility for freedom and justice and\r\nthe strong would respect the rights of the weak — a world\r\nof open borders, open trade and open minds. Such a vision\r\ncan and should surely be our goal and inspiration. To\r\nachieve it, in particular at the regional level, cooperation in\r\ncarefully identified core areas of activity, including trade\r\nand investment, is a valuable tool of development.\r\nIn our own region, through the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), we are\r\nstriving to accelerate progress in core areas of cooperation,\r\nsuch as poverty eradication, expansion of regional trade and\r\ninvestment. We have also, within the ambit of SAARC,\r\nlaunched a “growth quadrangle” involving four member\r\nStates — Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Bhutan — in order\r\nto explore areas of joint economic activity and take\r\nadvantage of the factor of contiguity. Moreover, outside of\r\nSAARC, Bangladesh has entered the Bangladesh-India-Sri\r\nLanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation (BIST-EC) in order\r\nto boost cooperation in the economic and commercial fields\r\namong its four member countries. A consensus decision has\r\nnow been taken to allow Myanmar to join this subregional\r\ngroup as a full member.\r\nLast year, while addressing the General Assembly, I\r\nreferred to the negotiations that were being held with India\r\non sharing the waters of the Ganges River. This had proved\r\nto be an intractable problem for over two decades and it is\r\na matter of great satisfaction to us all that, in December last\r\nyear, we signed a 30-year treaty at the highest political\r\nlevel with India on sharing arrangements. The signing of\r\nthis treaty, within months of the present Government’s\r\nassumption of office, demonstrated that, given goodwill and\r\npolitical will, the most difficult problems can be resolved.\r\nAt the national level, we are affording every facility\r\nand cooperation to our private sector and providing liberal\r\nincentives to foreign entrepreneurs to invest in our country.\r\nThe Government’s role will be to oversee and to provide\r\nsafety nets where necessary. The Government is making\r\nevery effort to combat the blighting scourges of\r\nwidespread poverty and deprivation, so that we may\r\nrealize the dream — to which the Father of the Nation,\r\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, dedicated his\r\nentire political career and life — of a country free,\r\nprogressive and prosperous, at peace with the world and\r\nwith itself.\r\nOurs has also been a pioneering role in the field of\r\nmicrocredit. Initiated by the Grameen Bank and\r\nconsidered a most innovative approach to the eradication\r\nof poverty and empowerment of women, it has been\r\nrecognized and emulated in a good number of developing\r\nand developed countries. The Microcredit Summit held in\r\nWashington earlier this year was a success: a target was\r\nset there to free 100 million families from the\r\nstranglehold of poverty by the year 2005. At the United\r\nNations, the “Friends of Microcredit” ambassadors have\r\ntaken the initiative to follow up the implementation\r\nprocess throughout the United Nations system.\r\nIn Bangladesh, we have accorded priority to and\r\nplaced special emphasis on social sector development in\r\nsuch areas as health care, education, family planning,\r\nwomen in development and the preservation and\r\npromotion of human rights. The initiatives and efforts of\r\nour Prime Minister in this regard have been widely\r\nappreciated. I would particularly mention here that the\r\nGovernment, under the dynamic leadership of Prime\r\nMinister Sheikh Hasina, the illustrious daughter of the\r\nFather of the Nation, has announced the decision to set up\r\na National Human Rights Commission. Our Parliament is\r\nexpected to pass the required legislative mandate for this\r\nCommission next year. We are also working towards the\r\nestablishment of grameen, or rural, courts, which will\r\ntake justice to the people at the grass-roots level. This\r\nconcept of participatory justice is still a novel one. Its\r\npurpose is to ensure speedy, effective and inexpensive\r\njustice to the humblest of citizens.\r\nWhile on the subject of human rights, I should like\r\nto express our pleasure that an individual of the eminence\r\nand distinction of Mrs. Mary Robinson has been\r\nappointed United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights. We would like to assure her of the wholehearted\r\ncooperation of our Government. We look forward to\r\nworking with her in close concert in the promotion of\r\nhuman rights, a goal that all of us share and cherish, with\r\nspecial focus on the right to development and the rights\r\nof women and children.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nThe Constitution of Bangladesh specifically provides\r\nfor our international relations to be based, inter alia, on the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. It is thus for us a\r\nmatter of singular pride and gratification that Bangladesh\r\nshould be playing such an active role in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. This is a role that we consider to\r\nbe a solemn duty and an earnest of our commitment to the\r\nUnited Nations and the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter.\r\nWe still have a long way to go in the area of\r\ndisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. The entry\r\ninto force of the Chemical Weapons Convention is a major\r\nstep forward.\r\nIt is a truism that our world is becoming increasingly\r\ninterdependent. The uncomfortable fact remains, though,\r\nthat it is still a far more dangerous place than that it should\r\nbe. West Asia, the Palestinian issue, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Afghanistan and the Great Lakes region all\r\npresent problems that impinge on international peace and\r\nsecurity. The United Nations, of course, is playing a pivotal\r\nrole in seeking peaceful and equitable resolutions of these\r\nproblems.\r\nWe sincerely hope that the peace process in the\r\nMiddle East will move forward and that the years of\r\nnegotiations, investment and effort will bear fruit. Our\r\nviews on this particular issue are well known. Relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions exist, as do agreements\r\nnegotiated outside the ambit of the United Nations, on the\r\nbasis of which a meaningful peace can be achieved in the\r\nMiddle East and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople, including the right to an independent homeland,\r\nrestored.\r\nAs we approach the next century, it will have to be\r\nour collective endeavour to strengthen and to reinforce\r\ninstitutions at the global level that can effectively address\r\nthe problems of the post-cold-war world. The United\r\nNations in essence represents the entire human race in\r\nmicrocosm, with its wisdom and follies, its successes and\r\nshortcomings. It is an experiment, as was once said, in\r\nliving together as a single human family. To be sure, the\r\nUnited Nations is an Organization of Governments — the\r\napex of intergovernmental organs. And yet it is also true\r\nthat its foundations rest on the yearnings of the peoples of\r\nthe world for a lasting peace.\r\nThe opening words of the Charter read:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations determined\r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar”.\r\nThe peoples and nations of the world will have to work\r\nin concert if stability, prosperity and a meaningful peace\r\nare to be achieved on a global scale. Bangladesh, of\r\ncourse, will be at the forefront of this endeavour.\r\nAddress by Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of\r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Sierra Leone.\r\nAlhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone, His Excellency\r\nAlhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabbah: It is indeed an honour once\r\nagain to address the General Assembly.\r\nOn behalf of the people of Sierra Leone, and on my\r\nown behalf, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\r\npreside over the work of this session, which you rightly\r\ndescribed as one that can mark the beginning of a new\r\nera in United Nations history. Ukraine, a founding\r\nMember of our Organization, is well known for its\r\ndecisive stand on unilateral nuclear disarmament. This in\r\nitself is a major contribution to the promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security. As an experienced\r\ndiplomat and former senior member of the Secretariat,\r\nyou are fully equipped to steer this session to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the firm and\r\nskilful manner in which he led the Assembly in dealing\r\nwith the issues of the fifty-first session.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for the bold\r\neffort he has made so far in mapping out the tracks of his\r\nquiet revolution, a reform of the Secretariat. This is\r\nperhaps the first time in the history of the Organization\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nthat we have in the same session a President of the General\r\nAssembly and a Secretary-General both of whom were staff\r\nmembers of the United Nations Secretariat. I would like to\r\nconvey through the Secretary-General our appreciation to\r\nthe entire staff of the United Nations system, who have\r\nbeen and continue to be pillars supporting the structures of\r\npeace and economic and social well-being which our\r\nOrganization is building in various parts of the world.\r\nWhen I addressed this body last year, I spoke at length\r\nabout my Government’s efforts to reach a peace agreement\r\nwith the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the settlement\r\nof people displaced by the conflict and our efforts at\r\nnational reconciliation. I also spoke of our hopes: our hopes\r\nfor the consolidation of our new democracy, for the revival\r\nof our economy and for the regeneration of communities\r\nscarred by years of war. These were no starry-eyed\r\npronouncements. We were too well aware of the challenges\r\nwhich the achievement of these objectives entailed, but we\r\nwere tackling them in a spirit of realism within the\r\nframework of a united national effort and, above all, in\r\nconfident hope.\r\nIn the economic sphere, for example, the response was\r\npromising. My Government was credited within a year with\r\nthe introduction of a social security scheme and a minimum\r\nwage act; accountability and transparency in public\r\nspending; trade liberalization and public enterprise reform,\r\nincluding privatization; reduction of the rate of inflation\r\nfrom 65 per cent to 6 per cent; achievement of a 5 per cent\r\neconomic growth rate, which had been minus 10 per cent\r\na year earlier; and plans for an investment code. These are\r\nsome of the signposts of confidence which national and\r\ninternational investors saw when they concluded that Sierra\r\nLeone was well on its way to economic recovery. Prospects\r\nfor that recovery were at their highest in more than two\r\ndecades.\r\nToday I appear before you with a heavy heart. As I\r\nspeak, a great tragedy is unfolding in my country. On 25\r\nMay 1997, a combination of elements of the Sierra Leone\r\narmy and the Revolutionary United Front violently\r\noverthrew my democratically elected Government and\r\nunleashed on the country a reign of terror unprecedented in\r\nits scope and ferocity. Overnight, Sierra Leone was\r\ntransformed into a gulag of horrors: the killing of\r\ndefenceless, innocent civilians, looting, confiscation of\r\nproperty and rape. These atrocities continue. The people of\r\nSierra Leone have been ushered into a long night of\r\ndarkness. For the first time in our history, the survival of\r\nour national society as a morally and socially cohesive\r\nwhole has been put into question.\r\nIt is against the background of these dramatically\r\nchanged conditions in my country that I appear before\r\nyou today, to make an appeal — a desperate appeal —\r\nfor help from the international community to save a\r\nnation and a people. My presence on this podium\r\nsymbolizes the people of Sierra Leone stretching out their\r\nhands to the United Nations, asking it to pull them back\r\nfrom the brink of catastrophe.\r\nThe people of Sierra Leone are united in a common\r\nfear, the fear that unless something is done, and done\r\nnow, the barbarism and adventurism of the military junta\r\nwill push the country over the brink. Their hope is that\r\nthe international community will not allow the military\r\njunta to convert their country into one vast killing field.\r\nIf the prevailing situation is allowed to drift much longer,\r\nbecause of a failure of political will, or for any other\r\nreason, then the hopes of a peace-loving nation for a life\r\nworthy of normal human beings will have been betrayed.\r\nI am more than convinced that this cannot be what the\r\nUnited Nations would like to see happen in Sierra Leone.\r\nMy belief in the United Nations, as the custodian of\r\nworld peace and security, and as the ultimate defence of\r\nthe weak and the defenceless, remains as strong as ever.\r\nIt is on the strength of this conviction, which has been a\r\npart of all my adult life, that I bring the case of Sierra\r\nLeone to the attention of the Assembly.\r\nOnly the speedy restoration of the democratically\r\nelected Government of Sierra Leone can provide a lasting\r\nsolution to the crisis and enable the country to return to\r\nnormalcy and to resume its place as a responsible member\r\nof the community of nations. This is no self-serving\r\nstatement. To insist on the restoration of my Government\r\nis no more than to insist that the Government which the\r\npeople of Sierra Leone freely and openly elected in the\r\nmost closely invigilated election in the post-independence\r\nhistory of the country be restored to them. Indeed, when\r\nthe Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nheld in Harare considered the matter it resolved strongly\r\nand unequivocally to condemn the coup d’état and called\r\nfor the immediate restoration of constitutional order in\r\nSierra Leone.\r\nMy Government emerged as a result of a transition\r\nprocess under the their military regime of the National\r\nProvisional Ruling Council. It was that regime which\r\nappointed the Interim National Electoral Commission as\r\nthe management body responsible for the conduct of both\r\nthe parliamentary and presidential elections. At the\r\nrequest of the Interior National Electoral Commission, the\r\nCommonwealth secretariat in London provided three\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nexperts, including a legal draftsman, to help with the\r\npreparations for the elections. None of these people had\r\nbeen to Sierra Leone before and they knew nobody in the\r\ncountry. The point of their attachment to the Interior\r\nNational Electoral Commission was to bring to bear on the\r\nwork of the Commission the highest international electoral\r\npractices. The European Union also provided a voter\r\neducation expert from Britain, while the United Nations\r\nsupplied a logistical expert.\r\nIn other words, at the heart of the election\r\nmanagement body, the international community had a\r\npresence to ensure the highest standard of probity and\r\ntransparency in the conduct of the elections.\r\nIn January 1996, in the middle of the preparations for\r\nthe elections, Brigadier Maada Bio forced Captain\r\nValentine Strasser out of office as Chairman of the National\r\nProvisional Ruling Council and immediately launched a\r\ncampaign to postpone the elections. The banner of that\r\ncampaign was “Peace before Elections”. A national\r\nconsultative conference comprising representatives of\r\npolitical parties, the army, the police, trade unions,\r\nwomen’s organizations, the churches and mosques and\r\nother organizations of civil society was convened in\r\nFebruary 1996 to pronounce on the matter. I should add\r\nthat in attendance were also representatives of the\r\ninternational community. The overwhelming majority of the\r\ndelegates to the conference supported the holding of\r\nelections. Incidentally, the Revolutionary United Front was\r\ninvited to participate in the democratic process. Clearly\r\nillustrating its attitude towards legitimate democratic\r\nprinciples and procedures, the Front categorically refused to\r\nhonour the invitation.\r\nAnd so the elections were held on 26 and 27 February\r\n1996. There were observers from the Commonwealth, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the African-\r\nAmerican Institute, the African-American Labor Center, the\r\nCommonwealth Trade Union Council and the World\r\nCouncil of Churches, all coordinated by no less a body than\r\nthe United Nations itself. At the close of polling, and long\r\nbefore the official declaration of the results, the\r\ninternational observers made a joint statement on 29\r\nFebruary 1996, in which they said that, despite setbacks,\r\nthey had witnessed a remarkably peaceful, orderly and\r\ntransparent conduct of the vote, which led them to conclude\r\n“that the results will genuinely reflect the will of the\r\npeople of Sierra Leone and usher in an era of\r\ndemocracy”.\r\nHaving failed to prevent the holding of the elections\r\nthrough political manoeuvring, the anti-democratic forces\r\nwithin the army and their Revolutionary United Front\r\nallies launched a campaign of terror and intimidation in\r\nthose parts of the countryside where the rebels had a\r\npresence to scare away people from voting. Many\r\ninnocent men and women had their hands cut off. Some\r\nwere branded with hot irons and many more were\r\nmutilated in ways that I cannot describe in public. But no\r\nintimidation could overcome the determination of the\r\npeople to put an end to military rule and all its associated\r\nabuses.\r\nThe elections which brought my Government into\r\noffice were more than an electoral exercise to replace one\r\nGovernment with another. They were no less than an\r\nopportunity — indeed, a historic opportunity — for the\r\npeople of Sierra Leone to put an end to nearly 30 years\r\nof undemocratic rule, the last four of which were an\r\noutright military dictatorship.\r\nIn retrospect, the victories of the people, first against\r\nthe political sleight of hand to stop the elections, and then\r\nagainst the campaign of terror and intimidation to scare\r\naway the voters from the polling booths, seem to have\r\nleft the reactionary forces in our country with only one\r\nremaining avenue to their objective, the unconstitutional\r\noverthrow of any civil Government, and that was\r\nprecisely what happened on 25 May.\r\nThe people of Sierra Leone have responded to the\r\ncoup in a manner unique in the history of Africa.\r\nThousands of citizens, some out of fear for their lives and\r\nother human rights violations, simply abandoned their\r\nhomes and their country, moved into neighbouring\r\ncountries, declaring they would rather live as refugees\r\noutside Sierra Leone than stay under the rule of the illegal\r\njunta. Those who stayed behind have refused to go to\r\nwork and have in various ways refused to cooperate with\r\nthe junta. This is the manifestation of the determination\r\nof Sierra Leoneans never to surrender their hard-won\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThe struggle under way in my country is between\r\nthe unarmed millions defending the cause of democracy\r\nand the armed reactionary clique of mutinous soldiers and\r\ntheir Revolutionary United Front cohorts. In embarking on\r\nthat perilous struggle, the people of Sierra Leone were\r\nnever in doubt as to where the sheer military advantage\r\nlay. What continues to sustain the determined resistance\r\nof the people and to fortify their courage is the belief, and\r\nthe expectation, that the international community cannot,\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nand will not, let them down — indeed, the belief that,\r\nwhatever hardship they are facing at the moment, right will\r\nultimately triumph over might.\r\nNo one who has seen the reign of terror unleashed by\r\nthe regime on the defenceless citizenry or witnessed the\r\ndaily looting, rape and other brutalities which have now\r\nbecome a way of life in Sierra Leone can mistake this for\r\npeace. There is no peace in Sierra Leone. What is\r\nhappening is that the horrors which the RUF inflicted on\r\nthe rural communities — the killings, the amputation of\r\nlimbs, the looting, the arbitrary and illegal seizure of\r\nprivate property of all kinds and many other crimes — have\r\nnow been generalized to encompass the urban centres as\r\nwell. To further compound their assault on innocent\r\ncivilians, the illegal junta has finally resorted to the laying\r\nof anti-personnel landmines throughout the country, and\r\nwithin the capital city itself. I need not spell out what a\r\nhorrific act this represents as far as innocent men, women\r\nand children are concerned as they begin to fall victim to\r\nthese hidden devices.\r\nThis was precisely what my Government set out to\r\navert. In my inaugural statement as President, I made the\r\npursuit of peace and the end of the rebel war my most\r\nurgent priority. Within a matter of days of assuming office,\r\nI signed a communiqué at Yamoussoukro, in Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nwith the leader of the RUF, Corporal Foday Sankoh, in\r\nwhich we effectively agreed upon a permanent ceasefire.\r\nThat agreement opened the way for substantive negotiations\r\nbetween the Government and the RUF, culminating in the\r\nAbidjan peace accord of 30 November 1996.\r\nWhat my Government did not know was that the RUF\r\nwas negotiating in bad faith. We took the RUF at its word\r\nand assumed that its professed commitment to peace was\r\ngenuine. The negotiations were protracted because the RUF\r\nwas adamant on certain issues. We conceded on those\r\nparticular issues with the hope that the RUF would honour\r\nthe resulting accord. This is, of course, not to suggest that\r\nthere were no doubters in our ranks who harboured\r\nmisgivings about the sincerity of the RUF. We had our\r\nshare of these doubting Thomases, but on the basis of our\r\npeoples yearning for peace, we elected to be guided more\r\nby our hopes and less by our fears.\r\nAfter peace, national reconciliation was another central\r\nplank of my Government’s policy. The pursuit of that\r\npolicy began with the very configuration of my\r\nadministration. My party had a substantial majority in\r\nParliament, and I myself had won the presidential elections\r\nwith a convincing majority. On the basis of the outcome of\r\nthe elections, therefore, I was under no obligation to\r\ninclude in my Government people from other parties. But\r\nI took a wider view of the matter and decided that if the\r\ncause of national reconciliation was to be advanced it\r\nwould be desirable to have a broad-based Government.\r\nAccordingly, I appointed the leader of one of the minority\r\nparties to be my Minister of Finance, making him,\r\neffectively, the third most senior member of the\r\nGovernment. Other ministerial and senior positions were\r\nfilled by people drawn from other political parties. What\r\nemerged as a result was a broad-based Government of\r\nnational unity in all but name.\r\nThe policy of national reconciliation was taken\r\nfurther. The previous military regime, the National\r\nProvisional Ruling Council (NPRC) had confiscated the\r\nproperties of many senior Sierra Leoneans not on the\r\nbasis of law or due process, but on ad hoc commissions\r\nof inquiry whose findings were not published and were\r\nsubject to no appeal. No one pretended that justice had\r\nbeen done by the work of those commissions of inquiry.\r\nYet, on the basis of their findings, not only had many\r\npeople lost their properties, some of them had also been\r\ndisqualified from holding public office. If Sierra Leone’s\r\nnew democracy was to mean anything, this was a state of\r\naffairs which could not be allowed to continue. I\r\nappointed a National Commission for Reconciliation and\r\napplied to the Commonwealth secretariat for a senior\r\nCommonwealth judge to review the findings of the\r\ncommission of inquiry and to put right what had been put\r\nwrong. I wanted a judge of suitable seniority and\r\ndistinction whose verdict would command respect. The\r\nCommonwealth Secretary-General secured for me the\r\nservices of judge Ulric Cross of Trinidad and Tobago. He\r\nwas due to return to Sierra Leone to resume his\r\nchairmanship of the National Commission for\r\nReconciliation when the coup took place.\r\nFollowing the earlier coup of April 1992, which had\r\ninstalled the NPRC military regime in power, many Sierra\r\nLeoneans went into exile. They, too, had to be enabled to\r\ncome home in security and in dignity. Former President\r\nJoseph Saidu Momoh had been living in exile in Guinea\r\nsince the coup of April 1992. My Government brought\r\nhim home and resettled him in a manner befitting a man\r\nwho had been our Head of State.\r\nI have gone into this background in detail to show\r\nwhat my Government did to end the war that had been\r\nraging for the best part of five years, to achieve national\r\nreconciliation and to usher in lasting peace. All this and\r\nmuch else will be erased if the regime is allowed to\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nremain in power. The burning question before the world\r\ncommunity, therefore, is how best to bring a swift end to\r\nthe ruinous regime of the military and to enable Sierra\r\nLeone to rejoin the mainstream of human society.\r\nSome people with the best of intentions but with little\r\nknowledge of the situation have called for negotiations to\r\nend the tragedy unfolding in Sierra Leone.I have been\r\ninvolved in negotiations of one kind or another throughout\r\nmy career. In fact, in a sense negotiating is second nature\r\nto me. Accordingly, I have no problems with the principle\r\nof negotiation. But it would be utterly disingenuous of me\r\nnot to state the serious reservations I hold about negotiating\r\nwith the junta.\r\nIn the first place, the junta is an unstable coalition. On\r\nthe surface it presents itself as a government in which every\r\nmember shares collective responsibility for decisions jointly\r\ntaken. In reality it is nothing of the kind. There is nothing\r\ncollective about the junta except the determination of its\r\nconstituent parts to hang on to power. For now the RUF\r\nmay be allied with some elements of the army, but there is\r\nno pretence that they are motivated by the same long-term\r\nobjectives. The RUF is not the army, and it is certainly not\r\nunder the command of the mutinous faction of the Army.\r\nThe RUF has a separate and independent command\r\nstructure, and it takes its instructions from its own high\r\ncommand. Therefore, based on our experience, in any\r\nputative negotiations with the RUF it can be expected to\r\ncome to the table with its own set of demands. The\r\ndecision of one part of the unstable coalition will not, by\r\nany stretch of the imagination, bind the other. Indeed,\r\nprecisely because they have separate and quite possibly\r\nconflicting objectives there is hardly any prospect of\r\nnegotiating with anything like a unified position.\r\nIn the second place, the RUF is undoubtedly the\r\nfaction with the upper hand within the junta. The RUF’s\r\nprincipal objective all along has been to take and keep\r\npower by all means, including terror and murder. In its\r\npresent configuration, the RUF has no coherent programme\r\nto speak of. Rather than yield power peacefully, the RUF\r\nhas threatened to launch a scorched-earth campaign to\r\nreduce the country to ashes. Its position is that if it cannot\r\nrule Sierra Leone, nobody else should.\r\nAnd if none of these points is convincing, we have\r\nonly to look at the way in which the junta has handled the\r\nnegotiations with the Committee of four Foreign Ministers\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS). The three-point ECOWAS formula for the\r\nresolution of the Sierra Leone crisis entailed, in order,\r\n“the early reinstatement of the legitimate\r\nGovernment of President Tejan Kabbah, the return\r\nof peace and security and the resolution of the issues\r\nof refugees and displaced persons”.\r\nThis was the basis on which the regime entered into\r\nnegotiations with the ECOWAS Committee of four. The\r\nthird meeting between the Committee and representatives\r\nof the regime in Abidjan took place on 30 July 1997. It\r\nwas expected to be a breakthrough meeting. However,\r\nwhile it was in progress, the leader of the junta made a\r\nradio and television broadcast in which he stated clearly\r\nthat his regime was determined to remain in power for a\r\nminimum of four years. His statement was intended to\r\nwreck the talks, and that was exactly what it did. He has\r\nnot retracted his determination to stay in power for four\r\nyears.\r\nIf, in spite of the illegal junta’s record of bad faith,\r\nthe international community insists that we must take the\r\npath of negotiations, then I suggest that such negotiations\r\nshould be held between the junta and the Committee of\r\nECOWAS Foreign Ministers, whose membership has now\r\nbeen increased to five. And for those negotiations to be\r\nmeaningful, they must proceed on the basis of clear\r\nunderstandings. In the first place, if the negotiations are\r\nresumed, the three-point ECOWAS negotiating agenda\r\nmust remain the agenda of such negotiations. Then they\r\nmust be time-bound. If they are open-ended, the regime\r\ncan be expected to filibuster and to spin them out\r\nindefinitely in the hope that it will achieve a creeping de\r\nfacto recognition by the international community.\r\nThen, the junta’s delegation must always be led by\r\nthe junta leader himself. The Committee of five should\r\ninsist on no less, because if the regime’s delegation is led\r\nby anyone else, the scope for subsequent repudiation and\r\ndouble-dealing will become infinite. Finally, to ensure\r\nthat the regime treats the negotiations with the seriousness\r\nthey deserve, existing international pressures and\r\nmeasures must not only be maintained but further\r\nstrengthened. In that way the genuineness of the regime’s\r\ndeclared intention to negotiate will be tested.\r\nWhen all this is done and an agreement is reached,\r\nwe will still have to face the task of achieving genuine\r\nand total national reconciliation. What Sierra Leone needs\r\ntoday more than anything else is peace and reconciliation.\r\nI have never lost sight of this need, and it is the one\r\nobjective which has influenced every step that I have\r\ntaken since assuming office in March 1996. The events of\r\n25 May have only further deepened those divisions within\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nour society which my policies had begun to heal. As a\r\nresult, the adoption of a more vigorous policy of national\r\nreconciliation has become an absolute necessity.\r\nIt would not be exaggerating the case to say that the\r\nbrand of political persuasion practised by the military-RUF\r\ncoalition borders on systematic genocide. Since 25 May\r\n1997, whole villages, entire communities and targeted\r\nfamilies have been wholly or partially decimated in the\r\neastern, northern and southern provinces of Sierra Leone,\r\nin Moyamba, Bonthe, Sanda, Bumpe, Kumrabai,\r\nForedugu — the list is endless.\r\nThat is why many Sierra Leoneans strongly believe\r\nthat a war crimes tribunal should be appointed to try all\r\nthose who had a hand in the making of our tragedy. I\r\nunderstand the feelings behind this demand, but I reject it.\r\nl reject it because it will add to our already grave problems\r\nand postpone lasting national reconciliation.\r\nThroughout this address I have tried to draw a\r\ndistinction between elements of the army in complicity with\r\nthe head of the junta and the bulk of the army, who are\r\nbasically decent men and women and loyal to the best\r\ntraditions of the Sierra Leone army. Even so, I do not\r\nbelieve that any worthwhile national purpose will be served\r\nby a policy of reprisals against the misguided elements of\r\nthe army and others in the junta’s camp.\r\nWe seek no more from the United Nations than the\r\nassurance of 6 August 1997 contained in the statement\r\nmade by the President of the Security Council:\r\n“The Security Council will, in the absence of a\r\nsatisfactory response from the military junta, be ready\r\nto take appropriate measures with the objective of\r\nrestoring the democratically elected Government of\r\nPresident Kabbah.” (S/PRST/1997/42, p. 1)\r\nAt the same time, we are asking the Security Council\r\nto assist ECOWAS and the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG) in giving practical effect to that objective. By\r\ndoing so, the Council will not only be saving the lives of\r\nthe people of Sierra Leone, but will also be averting an\r\nescalation of the crisis which now threatens peace and\r\nsecurity in our subregion. And here I should like to take\r\nthis opportunity to express, on behalf of my Government\r\nand the people of Sierra Leone, our sincere appreciation to\r\nthe Heads of State and the Committee of Foreign Ministers\r\nof ECOWAS for their efforts over the past four months in\r\npursuit of their objective, which the Security Council\r\nsupports.\r\nOnce the objective of restoring the democratically\r\nelected Government is achieved, my Government will, in\r\nthe same spirit of reconciliation which had guided its\r\npolicies since the 1996 elections, consider, in an\r\nappropriate forum, the serious question of security and\r\nfull implementation of the Abidjan Peace Agreement.\r\nSecurity is paramount. Without security, no meaningful\r\nhumanitarian assistance can reach the people of Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nNotwithstanding the acts of bad faith initiated by the\r\nRUF to derail the peace process and despite the\r\ndangerous coalition which had emerged since the 25 May\r\ncoup, my Government, the legal Government of Sierra\r\nLeone, is committed to the Agreement. We are also\r\ncommitted to the Secretary-General’s plan and\r\nrecommendations, submitted to the Security Council last\r\nJanuary, for the establishment and maintenance of a\r\npeacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone in connection\r\nwith the implementation of the Abidjan Peace Agreement.\r\nWe are ready to reactivate my Government’s agenda\r\nfor reconciliation, resettlement of refugees and displaced\r\npersons, and rehabilitation and reconstruction which the\r\nmilitary-RUF junta so ruthlessly disrupted almost five\r\nmonths ago. We owe it to our people to continue the\r\ntransformation of our economy from emergency relief\r\nprogrammes to realistic projects for medium- and long-\r\nterm self-sufficiency. Of course, we know that this is not\r\ngoing to be easy. However, we are confident that the\r\nimmediate and unconditional restoration of my\r\nGovernment, the Government elected by the people,\r\nconstitutes the first step towards that transformation.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Sierra\r\nLeone for the statement he has just made.\r\nAlhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Hungary, His Excellency Mr. László\r\nKovács.\r\nMr. Kovács (Hungary): I am very pleased to see the\r\nForeign Minister of neighbouring Ukraine assume the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nprestigious post of President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-second session. In fulfilling your challenging tasks you\r\nmay rest assured of the support and cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Hungary.\r\nOur tribute and thanks are also due to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, who\r\nserved us with distinction and innovative spirit.\r\nIn the post-cold-war era, international organizations\r\nare undergoing a profound adaptation process. Here, in the\r\nUnited Nations, we are only at the beginning of a bumpy\r\nroad. Whether the United Nations can find its place in the\r\nnew international political environment of the twenty-first\r\ncentury depends on our foresight, realism and\r\ndetermination. If our decisions are underpinned by a\r\nstrongly shared joint commitment to tackle the global\r\nagenda, we can make the United Nations relevant for the\r\nnext millennium.\r\nThe reform proposals presented by Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan are guided by the urgency of the task, sober\r\nrealism and healthy idealism as well as personal\r\ncommitment to change. We welcome the intention of the\r\nSecretary-General to proceed to the early implementation of\r\nconcrete organizational measures within his own areas of\r\ncompetence.\r\nThe package of proposals which require action by the\r\nMember States themselves truly captures those areas of\r\nUnited Nations activities where agreements are necessary at\r\nthis stage. The suggestions to ensure the desired coherence\r\nof United Nations efforts in development cooperation, to\r\nbolster its institutional capacity to combat international\r\ncrime, drug-trafficking and terrorism, or to integrate human\r\nrights concerns into all principal United Nations activities\r\nand programmes deserve our full support and need swift\r\nand concrete action. Let me add the voice of my delegation\r\nto all those who have called for approval at this session of\r\nthe package as a whole, which will have to be followed by\r\npractical steps in order to translate it into meaningful\r\naction.\r\nIn its foreign policy Hungary continues to serve\r\ninternational peace and stability, with special regard to its\r\nown region. The tragic events in former Yugoslavia, the\r\ncrises and convulsions on the territory of the former Soviet\r\nUnion and elsewhere, the emergence of aggressive\r\nnationalism as well as populism in Central and Eastern\r\nEurope, as an appealing “remedy” for political problems,\r\neconomic difficulties and social tensions, are vivid\r\nreminders of the critical, sometimes lethal, nature of these\r\nchallenges. They underscore how important it is that the\r\ninternational community act with appropriate means and\r\nin a timely manner.\r\nMr. Boyd (Panama), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nHungary supports the efforts of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and of other\r\nmultilateral regional organizations to help prevent new\r\nconflicts, to initiate, where needed, peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building activities, to solidify the rule of law and to\r\npromote cooperation in the OSCE area. My country is\r\nseeking to consolidate genuine good-neighbourly relations\r\nwith all the countries of its region, especially with\r\ncountries bordering it, and to launch regional initiatives\r\nand enhance regional cooperation to better respond to the\r\nnew challenges threatening regional stability. It is in this\r\nspirit that we have been active in the creation of, and\r\nhave sought to expand, various forms of regional\r\ncooperation, such as the Central European Initiative, the\r\nCentral European Free Trade Agreement and the South-\r\nEast European Cooperative Initiative, involving a large\r\nnumber of countries in the region, or have moved ahead\r\nwith trilateral, more tailor-made, cooperative schemes\r\nwith a number of our immediate neighbours. Regional\r\nand cross-border cooperation is a valuable asset for\r\nregional stability and security, and has to be utilized to its\r\nfull potential.\r\nAs we look forward, from the invitation we received\r\nfrom the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in\r\nMadrid to the winding up of the accession talks with the\r\nAlliance, and in the expectation of the commencement of\r\nnegotiations on our entry into the European Union next\r\nJanuary, we wish to develop further such regional\r\nactivities of dialogue and wide-ranging cooperation in\r\norder to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines and\r\nto assist all the countries of the region in their drive to\r\njoin the mainstream European developments. We are also\r\nconfident that Hungary, through the structures of Euro-\r\nAtlantic integration, will become an even more active\r\npartner and supporter of the United Nations.\r\nThe post-cold-war era has brought to the forefront\r\nurgent questions. These include issues related to the\r\nfuture operation of the United Nations conflict-\r\nmanagement capacity. The debate unfolding on these\r\nproblems has political, legal and, quite often, emotional\r\ndimensions as well. We welcome the proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General geared towards enhancing the rapid\r\nreaction capabilities of the United Nations.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nIt is in this context that in recent years Hungary has\r\nincreased its participation in United Nations mandated\r\npeacekeeping operations in a variety of ways, including\r\nboth infrastructural and logistical support and the\r\ndeployment of military and police personnel, an example of\r\nwhich is the Hungarian contribution to the Implementation\r\nForce and the Stabilization Force and the considerable\r\nincrease in the number of Hungarian peacekeepers serving\r\nin the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus. We\r\nare pleased that the performance and professional skill of\r\nmy compatriots engaged in various such operations all\r\nacross the globe are considered positively.\r\nThe issue of the functioning and the size of the\r\nSecurity Council has been extensively dealt with at several\r\nUnited Nations forums. Legitimacy and efficiency are both\r\nimportant premises for any pattern of Security Council\r\nreform. The general view is that, once the Security Council\r\nis enlarged, its size and composition should be not an\r\nimpediment, but, rather, an asset for effective decision-\r\nmaking and action, enjoying the widest possible support\r\nand cooperation of the membership at large. Agreement on\r\nSecurity Council enlargement is a fundamental pillar of the\r\nUnited Nations reform process. We have to make sure that\r\nwith a future Security Council comprising Germany, Japan\r\nand countries each from Africa, Asia and Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean as permanent members, and also\r\nadditional non-permanent members, we preserve and\r\nenhance the purpose-oriented character of this important\r\nbody.\r\nThe financial reform of our Organization is an\r\nindispensable prerequisite to ensure its viability and\r\nrelevance. Payment of assessed contributions is an\r\nobligation under the United Nations Charter. Hungary has\r\nmade serious efforts to meet all its outstanding financial\r\nassessments, and now we belong to the yet small, but,\r\nhopefully, growing group of Member States which pay all\r\ntheir contributions to the regular as well as peacekeeping\r\nbudgets in full and without conditions.\r\nTo solve the financial crisis, we must find a way that\r\nis acceptable to Member States and is good for the\r\nOrganization. The delegation of Hungary stands ready to\r\njoin in further constructive efforts along the lines of the\r\nproposal presented by the European Union with a view to\r\narriving at a comprehensive compromise solution.\r\nAfter the demise of the political structures of the cold\r\nwar, international protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms can no longer be relegated to some\r\ndistant corner of United Nations activities. As a legitimate\r\nconcern of the international community, human rights\r\nissues should be given their due weight in all United\r\nNations activities, in a well coordinated manner. This\r\nmust be reflected in the provision of adequate funding.\r\nToday, human rights are violated on a massive scale\r\nworldwide, and we all must stand up in their defence and\r\nhold violators accountable wherever abuses occur. We are\r\naware that there exist regional, cultural and other\r\nspecificities in the field of human rights. We believe,\r\nhowever, that these should not stand in the way of\r\nconsistency in promoting universal respect for human\r\nrights and should not allow complacency to surface in\r\nattitudes towards human rights violations.\r\nWe are pleased with the Secretary-General’s\r\nexcellent choice of Mrs. Mary Robinson to serve as the\r\nnext High Commissioner for Human Rights. We will lend\r\nher assistance to make the United Nations more effective\r\nin responding to human rights challenges, including those\r\nstemming from ethnic discrimination. As recent\r\ndevelopments have shown, these represent a threat to\r\nregional and international stability and security.\r\nDevelopment and environment are questions of the\r\nutmost importance for the future, and even the survival,\r\nof humankind. United Nations activities in this sphere\r\nshould lead to the elaboration of a comprehensive\r\nprogramme for sustainable development acceptable to all\r\nnations. We wish to voice our concern about the\r\ninsufficient progress achieved in this domain. We lend\r\nour full support to efforts aimed at seeking solutions to\r\nthe burning questions of underdevelopment and at\r\nstopping the processes of degradation of the ecological\r\nhabitat of our planet.\r\nArmed conflicts continue to take their toll,\r\nsometimes decades after the cessation of hostilities, due\r\nto the presence of anti-personnel landmines. The plight of\r\ntens of thousands of innocent victims has been a growing\r\nsource of international concern in no small part as a result\r\nof effective advocacy by human rights groups and\r\nhumanitarian organizations. Hungary stands for the total\r\nban of these devices. My Government has supported the\r\nOttawa process from its very inception; it welcomes the\r\nsuccess of the Diplomatic Conference held on this issue\r\nat Oslo and intends to become one of the first signatories\r\nof the new Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction. This is an important\r\nmilestone in the development of international\r\nhumanitarian law and in the endeavour to put an end to\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nthe immense human suffering caused by the proliferation\r\nand indiscriminate use of these weapons. At the same time,\r\nin our view, the remarkable achievements of the Oslo\r\nConference do not diminish the role that other forums,\r\nincluding the Conference on Disarmament, can play in\r\npromoting the objectives of the new Convention.\r\nThe horrible atrocities and genocidal acts committed\r\nduring recent conflicts have speeded up negotiations on\r\nestablishing international criminal jurisdiction on war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. By establishing the ad\r\nhoc tribunals on former Yugoslavia and on Rwanda, the\r\ninternational community reaffirmed an important principle:\r\nall those having committed war crimes or crimes against\r\nhumanity are to be held personally responsible and\r\naccountable. It is our legitimate expectation that all persons\r\nindicted by the tribunals will be brought to justice and\r\nmoreover that failing to cooperate fully with the tribunals\r\nwill not remain without consequences.\r\nThe experience gained from the functioning of these\r\ntwo ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider\r\nacceptance of the idea of an international criminal court,\r\nthus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the\r\nestablishment of individual criminal responsibility with\r\nregard to war crimes and crimes against humanity. We are\r\ncommitted to pursuing vigorously the negotiations at this\r\nsession to enable the finalization of the statute of the court\r\nat the diplomatic conference to be held next year.\r\nAt this session, we have to focus our efforts on\r\npreparing the ground for practical steps to make the United\r\nNations a viable and dynamic body. We must maintain the\r\nmomentum for change if we want to ensure a decent future\r\nfor the human experiment.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call next on His Excellency Mr. Bizima Karaha, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nMr. Karaha (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\r\n(interpretation from French): I wish from this rostrum to\r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his\r\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-second session. I am certain that the\r\nsuccessful conduct of the work of this session will justify\r\nthe confidence we all have in his outstanding qualities as a\r\nstatesman.\r\nI wish also to pay tribute to his predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, whose ability and intelligence\r\nwon the high regard of us all.\r\nLet me pay tribute also to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication to the cause of\r\ninternational peace and security and for his in-depth\r\nknowledge of the issues on which the future of world\r\npeace depends.\r\nI want to emphasize my country’s commitment to\r\nthe Charter ideals of peace, security, democracy, human\r\nrights and development. It is for the triumph of those\r\nideals that we have struggled. The Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo is among the few countries that from time\r\nimmemorial, owing to its geostrategic placement and its\r\nvast human and natural resources, has borne the burden\r\nof a sombre history of suffering and outrageous violations\r\nof human rights and the rights of peoples.\r\nIn 1885, when Africa was being colonized, my\r\ncountry was set up as a State that was the personal\r\nproperty of the King of the Belgians; it endured violence\r\nand blatant violations of human rights connected inter\r\nalia with the exploitation of red rubber and other kinds of\r\nforced labour. It became a Belgian colony in 1908, and\r\nwas later to experience a decolonization process that was\r\nnot merely botched, but was disastrous because my\r\ncountry became part of the global stakes in the East-West\r\nstrategic rivalry.\r\nAfter my country acceded to independence in June\r\n1960, at the height of the cold war, the symbol of our\r\nsovereignty, Prime Minister Patrice Emergy Lumumba,\r\nwas martyred to that sovereignty.\r\nUnder the complaisant eyes of the international\r\ncommunity, a bloody and reactionary dictatorship was\r\nformed in the very heart of Africa, in the strategic\r\ninterests of the dominating West, with the mission of\r\ndestabilizing neighbouring countries. Thirty years later,\r\nthanks to the political changes that took place in the\r\nworld in 1989, the international community saw\r\nregretfully the disastrous results of the support it had\r\ngiven to a regime that was a State in name only.\r\nThe disasters caused by these years of bloody and\r\nignoble dictatorship are so well known that there is no\r\nneed to recount them. The World Bank, the International\r\nMonetary Fund and all the bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem have studies, evaluations and gripping and moving\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\ntestimony of what the Mobutu regime represented at the\r\nend of the twentieth century.\r\nThe opening of this fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly coincides happily with the emergence in Africa\r\nof a new generation of leaders who are totally dedicated to\r\nthe cause of African renaissance and who are inspired by\r\nthe decisive will to take in hand the destiny of the continent\r\nand to play their role in the community of nations.\r\nAmong these individuals is Mr. Laurent-Désiré Kabila,\r\nwhose struggle for the restoration of the Republic dates\r\nback to 14 September 1960, the day when the first\r\nCongolese democratic experience was interrupted.\r\nThe triumph of the Congolese revolution on 17 May\r\n1997 is, after the defeat of apartheid in South Africa, the\r\nhistoric event of greatest political importance in modern\r\nAfrica. It represents the triumph of the return to pan-\r\nAfricanism, the only road to salvation for Africa in the\r\ncircumstances of today’s world.\r\nThe massive and spontaneous adherence of the\r\nCongolese to this armed struggle and the support received\r\nfrom friendly countries and from the entire world is enough\r\nto underline the positive nature of this liberation struggle.\r\nThe Congolese people are grateful to all for their\r\nsupport of the coming to Kinshasa of a progressive new\r\npower concerned with a state of law and improving of the\r\nwell-being of the people. The victory of the Alliance of\r\nDemocratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo over the\r\nMobutu dictatorship is indeed a victory of progressive and\r\npan-African Africa over obscurantism, pessimism,\r\nmorbidness and defeatism, which for such a long time were\r\npretexts for certain Powers to keep political and strategic\r\ncontrol of the continent. In that country in which the State\r\nand the Republic were moribund, the Government of public\r\nsecurity, led by President Laurent-Désiré Kabila, is working\r\ntirelessly and incessantly to restore the State and to rebuild\r\nthe Republic.\r\nThe efforts at domestic stabilization through\r\nreorganization of the State and the reconciliation of\r\nopinions and the return to work of the civilian population\r\nare accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace\r\nand regional stability in order to create economic and\r\npolitical conditions conducive to productive national and\r\nforeign investment.\r\nOur African policy is designed to improve bilateral\r\nrelations with all the States of the region, help them adapt\r\nbetter to the new geopolitical context and strengthen\r\ncooperation and regional integration. Along with the\r\nobjective of promoting economic development, we are\r\nalso working to achieve the prevention, management and\r\nresolution by Africa of the regional conflicts and crises\r\nthat are paralysing our continent.\r\nThis desire to change our foreign policy is based on\r\nour domestic policy, which is designed to rely primarily\r\non our own efforts and to give greater importance to\r\nregional and South-South cooperation in our trade\r\nactivities. Here, emphasis will be placed on trade\r\npromoting productive commerce and investments leading\r\nto the transfer of new and appropriate technology.\r\nWe intend, moreover, to pursue efforts designed to\r\nimprove our bilateral and multilateral relations with all\r\nour partners to ensure greater understanding for and\r\ncommitment to our programme of national reconstruction.\r\nThis programme essentially addresses urgent actions and\r\nsteps for rehabilitation, and their highly humanitarian\r\nnature deserves the unconditional support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThis Government programme comprises the\r\nfollowing priorities: infrastructure for transportation and\r\ncommunication, agriculture, health and social services,\r\nnational education, job creation and the elimination of\r\nunemployment, safety and protection of individuals and\r\nproperty and, in addition, peace and national and regional\r\nstability.\r\nIn the four months in which we have been leading\r\nthe State, we have been able to achieve encouraging\r\nresults, in particular at the political and diplomatic levels.\r\nThese include ensuring the safety of the population\r\nthrough the restoration of justice; guaranteeing the right\r\nof ownership; efforts to eradicate corruption, which had\r\nbecome institutionalized in our country; the reintegration\r\nof the military personnel of the former armed forces of\r\nZaire and the establishment of a national republican army;\r\nthe establishment of good regional relations, in particular\r\nthrough the holding in Kinshasa of a summit of Heads of\r\nState designed to work on strengthening regional\r\ncooperation; the working visits to Kinshasa by the\r\nPresidents of Uganda, Rwanda, Eritrea and Tanzania, as\r\nwell as the visits of the Congolese Head of State to\r\nAngola, South Africa, Rwanda, Namibia and Zambia.\r\nFurthermore, our Government has participated in meetings\r\nheld in the subregion on specific regional issues. We\r\nshould also note that President Kabila has been consulted\r\nby the actors in the current crisis in Brazzaville.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nEconomic steps include overcoming inflation and the\r\nrevaluation of the local currency, the decline in food prices,\r\nthe provision of essentials to urban centres, a monetary\r\nreform project now under way and the restructuring of the\r\ncentral bank.\r\nSocial and cultural steps include a resumption of\r\ncultural and artistic life, a resumption of primary and\r\nsecondary education despite a difficult situation for parents\r\nwho work for the State, providing drinking water for the\r\ncapital and electrification and public road projects.\r\nIn the debate at this session on proposals for\r\nreforming the United Nations, I would like, at the outset, to\r\nstate that the strategic objective of all of the reforms\r\nenvisaged must be to provide better conditions for the\r\nproper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfil\r\nits founders’ dream of a lasting, democratic, responsible\r\nand credible Organization.\r\nThe first stage of the effort must be to assess the\r\nimpact of the cold war on the original system of collective\r\nsecurity. Since the cold war paralysed the system set out in\r\nthe Charter, the end of the cold war should create\r\nconditions favourable to the triumph of the collective\r\nsecurity regime provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nThe second stage will be to analyse why the continual\r\nprogress of preventive diplomacy is accompanied by\r\ninefficiencies at the operational level in peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building. Furthermore, we must also consider the\r\npolitical powers of the main agent of preventive diplomacy\r\nto ensure that they conform to institutional limits.\r\nOur position with regard to the administrative reforms\r\nof the United Nations and the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil is that of Africa as a whole, as set out and\r\ndefended by the Secretary-General of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity. We are opposed to cosmetic reforms and to\r\nhaving members of the Security Council acting as mere\r\nfigureheads.\r\nOur interest in reform should not make us forget the\r\nnumerous conflict situations and threats to peace and\r\ninternational security throughout the world. Today Africa\r\ncontinues to occupy centre stage with regard to armed\r\nconflicts. Central Africa in particular has become a powder\r\nkeg as a result of uncontrolled armed bands crossing almost\r\nall our borders, bands who, in the guise of refugees, are\r\ndestabilizing the entire region.\r\nThat is why we urgently appeal to the United Nations\r\nto do everything it can to end its present policy of burying\r\nits head in the sand, which can only result in weakening\r\nand destabilizing those, such as the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, that have a role to play in the subregion.\r\nIt is now clear that the crisis in Brazzaville, for\r\nexample, is increasingly escaping the control of the\r\nparties to the conflict, and requires an urgent Security\r\nCouncil meeting. This crisis is unacceptable to the\r\nCongolese in both Brazzaville and Kinshasa. The\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which has been\r\nsubjected to deliberate shelling from neighbouring\r\nBrazzaville, which has been receiving refugees fleeing\r\nthat country and which, since 29 and 30 September 1997\r\nhas suffered loss of human life, without being a party to\r\nthe conflict, believes that the conflict has reached the\r\nlimit of what can be tolerated, given the damage to its\r\npeople and the threat it represents to regional and\r\ninternational peace and security. Just this morning we\r\nlearned that more shells had fallen on Kinshasa, and this\r\nis unacceptable to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe Central African Republic, which was badly\r\nbattered by the rebellions in the Kasayi camp, must\r\nbenefit from special cooperation from the United Nations\r\nto strengthen the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the\r\nImplementation of the Bangui Agreements, which is\r\nalready operational on the ground.\r\nWe firmly support the Lusaka Protocol, which is\r\ndesigned to re-establish peace and stability in Angola, a\r\ncountry with which we share a frontier of 2,600\r\nkilometres. We therefore demand that the Protocol be\r\nstrictly respected, and we condemn the repeated violations\r\nof its terms by UNITA.\r\nWith regard to Burundi, we support the Arusha\r\nprocess, and adhere to the principle of democracy and\r\nsecurity for all.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, we hope to see a return to legality\r\nand the democratic exercise of power.\r\nWe welcome the return of peace to Liberia, and the\r\nelectoral victory of President Charles Taylor, and we hope\r\nthat this experience will become a landmark and a point\r\nof reference for neighbouring States. The march towards\r\ndemocratization in Africa is inevitable and irreversible,\r\nbut the road is one which only the Africans can set out on\r\nand walk down.\r\nI should like to hail here the American initiative to\r\nhold a ministerial-level meeting of the Security Council\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nto strengthen the capacity of African States to build peace\r\nthrough conflict prevention and management and by the\r\nimprovement of good governance.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains worrying.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo urges all parties\r\nstrictly to respect the Madrid and Oslo agreements, and in\r\nall cases to give priority to genuine dialogue. The prize of\r\npeace is won through tolerance.\r\nIn the Far East, the reunification of Korea is a\r\npeaceful process that the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nfully supports. We hope for a positive outcome to the\r\nnegotiations under way.\r\nGlobal peace is also threatened by environmental\r\nproblems and by the continuation of the debt crisis of the\r\nleast developed countries. The Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, which has significant global forest reserves, appeals\r\nto the international community for assistance in preserving\r\nits forest heritage.\r\nMy country, whose foreign debt amounts to $14\r\nbillion, calls upon the major donors to demonstrate greater\r\nsolidarity and adopt a more responsible and consistent\r\napproach to possible solutions. In the specific case of the\r\nCongo, which has been devastated, we wonder what good\r\nthose billions of dollars did, as the country is in a state of\r\ntotal ruin — without roads, bridges, schools or hospitals. It\r\nis public knowledge that these funds never reached the\r\nCongo, and were for the most part deposited in American,\r\nEuropean and Asian banks. That is why we call for the\r\npure and simple cancellation of this debt; if necessary, we\r\nwill request the cooperation of the United Nations for the\r\nrestoration to the Congo of the $14 billion, now circulating\r\nin the world.\r\nWe should like here solemnly to express our gratitude\r\nto the Governments of the Republic of South Africa, the\r\nKingdom of Belgium, the Swiss Confederation and the\r\nUnited States for their cooperation in this matter, and hope\r\nthat everything possible will be done for a positive outcome\r\nto the processes under way.\r\nIn any case, the insolvency of my country and of other\r\nAfrican countries is a global problem that requires\r\nconsistent global treatment. It is therefore unfortunate that\r\ninternational cooperation in this area is only serving to\r\nintensify it and, furthermore, that any new contribution to\r\nnational reconstruction is conditional on the payment of\r\narrears.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo supports all\r\nthe initiatives and recommendations relating to the\r\nrestoration of cultural property confiscated in the past by\r\ncolonial Powers. In the same spirit, we support the\r\nestablishment of an international criminal court, which\r\nwould have competence over political economic, social,\r\ncultural and humanitarian crimes.\r\nDisarmament issues and their relationship with\r\ndevelopment are also on our foreign policy agenda. While\r\nwelcoming the Secretary-General’s initiative to establish\r\na new department for disarmament, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo would have liked to have been\r\napprised of how matters stood regarding the Conference\r\non Disarmament in Geneva to avoid duplication of\r\nefforts.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations will continue its\r\nefforts to guarantee a world free from nuclear weapons\r\nand that efforts aimed at general and complete\r\ndisarmament in regard to conventional weapons bear fruit.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is a party to\r\nthe Ottawa process on anti-personnel landmines. It\r\ncondemns both manufacturers and users and hopes that\r\ncondemnation of these weapons will go hand in hand with\r\na genuine will to find international settlements for civil\r\nwars and to prosecute individuals responsible for those\r\nwars for crimes against humanity.\r\nI could not conclude my remarks without mentioning\r\nthe general situation in the Great Lakes region,\r\nparticularly the Rwandan refugees and the United Nations\r\ncommission of inquiry on the allegations of massacres in\r\nthe east of our country.\r\nThe world campaign for human and humanitarian\r\nrights orchestrated against the Alliance of Democratic\r\nForces for the Liberation of Congo and against the\r\nGovernment of His Excellency the President,\r\nMr. Laurent-Désiré Kabila, in some ways recalls the\r\ndeplorable and unfortunate United Nations intervention in\r\nthe Congo in 1960.\r\nOur position is that the problem of refugees, whether\r\nthey be Hutus or not, must remain a humanitarian issue\r\nand can in no way become a political issue. Therefore,\r\nany attempt to politicize it should be condemned because\r\nit goes against the spirit and letter of the Charter of our\r\nOrganization.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nWith particular regard to the question of the alleged\r\nRwandan refugees and the allegations that they were\r\nmassacred, the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues\r\nto repeat, for anyone who wants to listen, that it has\r\nnothing to hide. Moreover, we have never concealed our\r\nmoral concern regarding the Rwandan women and children\r\nwho were taken hostage and fell victim to Rwandan\r\nextremists bent on genocide. What we do dispute in this\r\nmatter is the fact that the former Rwandan armed forces\r\nand the militia, the INTERAHAMWE, are classed as\r\nrefugees, which totally disregards the provisions of the\r\nGeneva Conventions and the relevant convention of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nHere, I should like to call to witness the Security\r\nCouncil, some of whose members rightly refused to\r\nsubscribe to the idea of an international intervention force\r\nled by Canada for the simple reason that the real Rwandan\r\nrefugees had returned to Rwanda. The armed bands who\r\nwent from Kibu as far as Congo (Brazzaville), the Central\r\nAfrican Republic and regions of Angola controlled by the\r\nUnião Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola\r\n(UNITA) are not refugees. They are hostage-takers and no\r\none has the right to ignore that.\r\nIn two and a half years, the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and all kinds of\r\nhumanitarian agencies could not repatriate more than 100\r\nrefugees to Rwanda. While they spent more than $1 billion,\r\nto the tune of $1.2 million per day, the Alliance of\r\nDemocratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo was able to\r\nassist in the voluntary repatriation, in conditions of full\r\nsecurity and dignity, of over 700,000 Rwandan refugees in\r\nfour days. In the same way, the Alliance of Democratic\r\nForces for the Liberation of Congo had called more than\r\nthree ceasefires for humanitarian reasons. That same\r\nmovement had opened humanitarian corridors — road, rail\r\nand air — to allow for and assist the repatriation of\r\nRwandan refugees. That same movement had fed and cared\r\nfor the so-called refugees, whom today it is accused of\r\nhaving massacred, in the equatorial forest.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is a place of\r\nrefuge and anyone who is being persecuted anywhere in the\r\nworld will find asylum there in accordance with the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1951 Geneva\r\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and the\r\nrelevant OAU convention. Thus, the Congolese from\r\nBrazzaville were welcomed shortly after the Rwandans\r\nwere repatriated but, paradoxically,\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nthese refugees did not receive the same attention from the\r\ninternational community as the Rwandan refugees. They\r\nhappen to be second-class refugees.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCan people at least realize what kind of and how\r\ngreat a toll the presence of Rwandan refugees, particularly\r\nof members of the former Rwandan armed forces and\r\nINTERAHAMWE, in the Congo will have taken? Has\r\nanyone taken the trouble to assess the impact of the\r\nactivities of these phoney refugees on the territory of the\r\nCongo?\r\nAnd since we could not speak of refugees without\r\nmentioning the United Nations commission of inquiry, I\r\nwould like to make the most of this opportunity to draw\r\nthe attention of this Assembly to the clearly humanitarian\r\nnature of the mission of the commission. In no way\r\nshould it turn itself into a political mission, as it has been\r\ntrying to do so far. It should be understood that its\r\ndeployment in the field must not violate our independence\r\nand sovereignty. Our confidence in the international\r\nOrganization is neither a sign of weakness nor a failure to\r\nsee, in this particular case, that there are plans afoot to\r\nuse these structures to undermine certain forces.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo has accepted, and I repeat,\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nwe have accepted that the team can do its work and we\r\nare expecting it to go ahead and do the work. Our\r\nGovernment will do anything in its power to make sure\r\nthat the team does its work. However, the team will then\r\nhave to answer a certain number of questions, especially\r\nin the eastern part of our country. Mainly, who did what,\r\nwhen, why, with whose help? The team will have to tell\r\nus why the refugees were armed. The team will have to\r\ntell us who armed them. Why were they not disarmed?\r\nThe team will have to tell us how many amongst the\r\nrefugees were really refugees and how many were\r\npseudo-refugees. The team will say how many Congolese\r\npeople were butchered by these people who have been\r\ncalled refugees, but more importantly, the team will tell\r\nus if there was any continuation of Rwandese genocide on\r\nCongolese soil because, as the Assembly knows, the same\r\npeople who committed genocide in Rwanda crossed the\r\nborder with their arms, with their machetes, with their\r\nideology, and they continued their work in our country.\r\nAnd, more importantly, the team will establish the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nresponsibility of everybody in that matter. But let me repeat\r\nagain, our Government is willing to help the team, to give\r\nfull access to the team, so that the team can go ahead and\r\ndo its work.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI should like to conclude my statement today with a\r\nmessage from Mr. Laurent-Désiré Kabila, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which reads:\r\n“My country has lost a great deal of time\r\nbecause of the injustices of the cold war. My people\r\nask only one thing: to build the well-being and\r\nprosperity they need, in full sovereignty and with\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of others. We thank all\r\nthose countries that are willing to assist us in our\r\nrecovery.\r\n“We have no other ambition. We are only\r\nconvinced that the world opinion that will satisfy us\r\ncan come only from ourselves. What we ask of the\r\nother nations of the world is that they assist us in\r\nseeing that those who are not in agreement with our\r\nview of things cannot thwart us.”\r\nWorld peace is one and indivisible, and the principle\r\nof collective responsibility obliges all of us to take that into\r\naccount.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Syrian\r\nArab Republic, His Excellency Mr. Farouk Al-Shara’.\r\nMr. Al-Shara’ (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): I take pleasure in congratulating the President\r\non his election to preside over the fifty-second session of\r\nthe General Assembly and to congratulate his friendly\r\ncountry on his election to that high international office. We\r\nare confident that his wide-ranging expertise will facilitate\r\nhis task and lead the deliberations of this session to a\r\nsuccessful end.\r\nI should also like to thank his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail, for his wise leadership of the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly.\r\nOn this occasion I cannot fail to renew my\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and to Africa, his great continent. I wish him full\r\nsuccess in discharging his tasks in accordance with the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter.\r\nAlthough more than 50 years have elapsed since the\r\nadoption of the Charter of the United Nations, and\r\nalthough States have since committed themselves to peace\r\nin their international relations, many regions of the world,\r\nparticularly in the Middle East, continue to suffer\r\noccupation, aggression and the threat of aggression to a\r\npoint where the sounds of war have begun to drown out\r\nthat of peace.\r\nIt has now become clear to most of those concerned\r\nwith peace and security in various corners of the Earth\r\nthat the peace process initiated at the Madrid Conference\r\nsix years ago has reached a dead end. This is due to the\r\nvolte-face by the current Israeli Government vis-à-vis that\r\nprocess, including the commitments, agreements and\r\npledges stemming from it. It is also due to its cynicism\r\ntowards all the strenuous international efforts seeking, for\r\nthe first time in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, to\r\nachieve a comprehensive solution to this conflict.\r\nPerhaps many of us, Governments as well as\r\npeoples, cannot foresee the extent of the serious\r\nrepercussions that will result from that Israeli reversal on\r\nthe peace process, particularly since it is taking place in\r\nthe post-cold-war period, when wars and armed\r\nconfrontations have taken ugly and barbaric forms and\r\nhave often raged out of control. Syria, which has opted\r\nfor the achievement of peace in the Middle East on the\r\nbasis of justice and dignity as a strategic choice, finds\r\nthat it is duty bound to train a spotlight from this\r\nimportant international rostrum on some facts concerning\r\nthe positions of the current Israeli Government. This\r\nshould enable the international community, with the\r\nsponsors of the peace process foremost among them, to\r\nbeware of any serious developments in the future leading\r\nto undermining the security and stability of the Middle\r\nEast region and beyond.\r\nAs a preliminary observation, I must point out that\r\nin our reading of the policy of the Israeli Government we\r\ndo not proceed from the perception widely held around\r\nthe world which classifies it as an extremist Zionist\r\nGovernment bent on negating the other party to the\r\nconflict rather than making peace with it. We proceed\r\nmerely from an objective description of declared positions\r\nof the Israeli Government and from its practices on the\r\nground, which — at a minimum — aim at gradually\r\nbacktracking from the commitments and agreements\r\nreached by the parties during the peace talks and\r\nultimately at completely eradicating the peace process\r\nlaunched at the Madrid Conference.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nIt seems to us that the method now employed by the\r\nIsraeli Government to reach that objective is not the usual\r\none of one step forward, two steps back. It is now a new\r\npractice, a tactic of one step back, then two steps back,\r\nfollowed by a threat of a further step backwards which\r\ncannot be abandoned, even provisionally, until the other\r\nside accepts new conditions it had already rejected. Thus,\r\nthe peace process regresses until it ultimately cancels itself\r\nout.\r\nIn this context, some may find it unfairly prejudicial\r\nto the Israeli Government to characterize its practices in\r\nsuch terms. They would, however, be surprised to learn that\r\nthe Head of the Israeli Government himself boasts to his\r\ninner circle of employing such a tactic, which he believes\r\nis a very astute means of ending the peace process as\r\nunobtrusively as possible.\r\nThis does not stop at the modus operandi alone, but\r\nextends to the details of the very fundamental issues\r\nunderpinning the peace process. While acknowledging the\r\napplicability of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\r\n338 (1973) to the occupied Syrian Golan, he also\r\nsimultaneously rejects the results reached on the Syrian\r\ntrack, with the participation of the United States as sponsor,\r\non the basis of those resolutions and relating to withdrawal\r\nto the line of 4 June 1967. He further rejects the resumption\r\nof negotiations from the point at which they were halted.\r\nIt is also strange that the Israeli Government rejects\r\nthe formula of land for peace, though it is at the very core\r\nof the United States initiative and has always enjoyed\r\ninternational unanimity. Instead of accepting this formula,\r\nthe head of the Israeli Government advances others that\r\nneither common sense nor logic could entertain and that\r\ncannot stand the test of time, such as the formula of peace\r\nfor peace or peace for security. It is clear that accepting\r\nthese two Israeli formulas would be tantamount to surrender\r\nand to becoming an instrument at the service of Israel’s\r\nsecurity.\r\nIt is indeed true that security issues are of the utmost\r\nimportance to all States, peoples and individuals. That is\r\nnot in doubt. However, security is the fruit of peace; the\r\nachievement of peace brings security and not vice versa.\r\nProceeding from that, we believe that the Israeli\r\nGovernment, in giving priority in its policy to security over\r\npeace, runs counter to all the concepts defined by societies\r\nand warring States throughout history. It is no exaggeration\r\nto say that the insistence of the Israeli Government on its\r\nerroneous concept of achieving security before ending\r\noccupation will turn the peace process into a bloodletting\r\nprocess, a cycle of killing that will obtain neither security\r\nnor peace for Israel and may return the Arab-Israeli\r\nconflict to its tragic beginnings.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations states that the\r\nefforts of the peoples of the world must be concerted in\r\norder to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar. Respect for the commitments proceeding from the\r\nprinciples of international law and its sources lies at the\r\nvery heart of the Charter. It is regrettable that the Israeli\r\nGovernment does not realize that its failure to respect the\r\ncommitments reached with the previous Government on\r\nthe Syrian track, based on the principles of international\r\nlaw and relevant Security Council resolutions, does not\r\nrepresent a mere legal violation. First and foremost, it\r\ncasts doubt on the credibility of any previous Israeli\r\nGovernment, and such doubts thus apply to the\r\ncommitments made by the current Administration when\r\nit is replaced.\r\nSince coming to power, the Israeli Government has\r\nnot limited its positions to undermining the peace process.\r\nIt has chosen the exact opposite path to that of peace. It\r\nhas increasingly diversified its attacks against Lebanon; it\r\nhas bombed cities teeming with civilians and has planted\r\nexplosive devices in many parts of southern Lebanon in\r\norder to incite enmity among the Lebanese and cast\r\naspersions on the role of the Lebanese resistance.\r\nHowever, such attempts, contrary to Israel’s objectives,\r\nhave only solidified unity among the Lebanese. They have\r\nstrengthened the resolve of the Lebanese resistance to\r\nconfront Israeli occupation more than ever before. In the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories, the pace of settlement\r\nactivities has escalated, including a sharing of roles\r\nbetween the Israeli Government and extremist settlers, in\r\norder to expropriate more land, destroy homes and\r\nmaintain the drive to judaize East Jerusalem.\r\nIn our occupied Syrian Golan, the policy of\r\nentrenching Israeli occupation has also been escalated to\r\nthe point that the Israeli Knesset recently voted on a bill\r\nentrenching the occupation and impeding withdrawal from\r\nthe Golan, in clear defiance of Security Council resolution\r\n497 (1981). This has been accompanied by an\r\nintensification of Jewish settlement activity with the aim\r\nof swelling the numbers of settlers in the Golan and\r\nundermining the chances for peace. That is a flagrant\r\nviolation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the first\r\nadditional Protocol thereof. The Golan is Syrian land —\r\nit always was and always will be. The Israelis will have\r\nto leave it sooner or later.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nWe, the Arabs, have championed just and\r\ncomprehensive peace and consider it a strategic choice. For\r\nsuch a choice to be realistic and supported by the people,\r\nit requires full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian\r\nGolan to the line of 4 June 1967, as well as from southern\r\nLebanon and the western Bekaa, in implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978). It must guarantee\r\nthe legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people,\r\nincluding those to self-determination and their own\r\nindependent State.\r\nSyria has always stressed its keen wish to establish a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Syria once\r\nagain expresses its grave concern at the serious obstacle\r\nthat Israel has placed on the road to that goal in order to\r\nprevent the establishment of the zone by refusing to adhere\r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). This intransigent Israeli position does great harm to\r\nthe credibility and universality of the Treaty. We believe\r\nthat the measures and arrangements to establish a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East, as called for by\r\nUnited Nations resolutions, require Israel, the only State in\r\nthe region possessing nuclear facilities and stockpiles, to\r\nadhere to the NPT and place all its nuclear establishments\r\nunder the full-scope safeguards regime of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency. It must further destroy its entire\r\nstockpile of nuclear weapons.\r\nAt a time when the urgent need to intensify\r\ninternational efforts towards a just and comprehensive\r\npeace in the Middle East is very clear, some States of the\r\nregion are engaging in military cooperation similar to an\r\nalliance and have recently declared their intention to\r\nconduct military manoeuvres in the eastern Mediterranean.\r\nSuch manoeuvres would be a threat to the peace and safety\r\nof neighbouring States as well as to the stability of the\r\nregion.\r\nSyria supports all the efforts being made to eliminate\r\ntension in various regions of the world and to resolve\r\nstanding problems. In this context, Syria underlines its\r\nconcern for the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. Syria\r\ncalls for easing the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq,\r\nwhile Iraq is required to implement the remaining Security\r\nCouncil resolutions in a manner ensuring a just solution to\r\nthe issue of Kuwaiti prisoners.\r\nWe also hope that there will be a positive response to\r\nthe initiatives of the League of Arab States and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, as well as towards the\r\nflexibility shown by the Libyan Government to resolve the\r\nLockerbie crisis. We would also like to see the embargo\r\nagainst Libya — a fellow Arab country — lifted, as well\r\nas an end to the suffering caused to the brotherly Libyan\r\npeople by that embargo.\r\nSyria supports measures to guarantee peace and\r\nsecurity in the Korean peninsula. We also wish to express\r\nour support for the aspirations of the Korean people for\r\nreunification. We further hope that serious efforts will be\r\nmade to provide assistance to the Korean people to\r\novercome its economic crisis.\r\nSyria stresses the need to take the necessary steps as\r\nsoon as possible to lift the economic, trade and financial\r\nembargo which has been imposed on Cuba for more than\r\n30 years.\r\nSyria is following with concern the severe conflicts\r\nafflicting some African countries. We call on the\r\ninternational community to make the necessary efforts and\r\nto endeavour to find solutions to these disputes, in close\r\ncooperation with the Organization of African Unity, in\r\norder to promote peace and stability on the African\r\ncontinent. The international community is further called\r\nupon to provide assistance of all kinds to enable African\r\nStates to eradicate the scourge of poverty and achieve\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAmong its primary purposes, the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations provides for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security; the fostering between\r\nnations of international relations based on respect for the\r\nprinciple of equal rights and self-determination of\r\npeoples; international cooperation in the economic, social,\r\ncultural and humanitarian fields; and the promotion of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all. It also\r\ncalls for non-interference in the internal affairs of States.\r\nThe Charter encouraged the establishment of specialized\r\nagencies in the field of international cooperation. It\r\nentrusted the General Assembly with setting out\r\nregulations governing the appointment by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the employees of the international\r\nOrganization. Syria underlines the importance of strict\r\nadherence to the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations during the process of reform of the Organization\r\nin order to enable it to respond to the needs and\r\naspirations of its Members in the twenty-first century.\r\nWe believe that promoting development is among\r\nthe first priorities of the United Nations. There is\r\ntherefore a need to underscore the right to development.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nSyria expresses its concern about any weakening of\r\nthe role and working methods of the General Assembly. We\r\ncall upon the General Assembly to perform its effective\r\nrole in accordance with the Charter.\r\nIn this context, we believe that the changes in the\r\ninternational arena and the significant increase in the\r\nnumber of Member States of the United Nations call for a\r\nreview of the composition and working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council. Checks and criteria must be put in place\r\nto prevent the arbitrary use of the veto power. Thus the\r\ndemocracy and transparency which are required in its\r\ndecision-making would be enhanced, thereby leading to\r\nmore fairness and balance, as well as to non-selectivity in\r\nthe implementation of the Council’s resolutions. Although\r\nthis is an urgent matter, we believe that, in order to reach\r\ngeneral agreement on this question, the reforms of the\r\nSecurity Council must not be subjected to a specific time-\r\nframe.\r\nThe Secretary-General recently presented his proposals\r\nto reform the United Nations. We appreciate the efforts he\r\nmade in preparing his proposals. However, proceeding from\r\nour concern to strengthen the United Nations capacity to\r\nshoulder the responsibilities entrusted to it, we would have\r\nwished to have seen in the proposals more attention given\r\nto the fundamental role of the Organization in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation for development. We would have\r\nliked the proposals to exclude any measures likely to affect\r\nthose programmes and activities related to development\r\nissues and poverty eradication in developing and least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nHuman rights are a very important issue, which we\r\nbelieve must continue to be pursued as an independent issue\r\nin order to avoid any overlap with other United Nations\r\nactivities. Such an amalgamation of issues would only\r\nfurther the opportunities to politicize human rights issues\r\nand their use as a means to exert specific pressures, to\r\nimpose preconditions or to intervene in the internal affairs\r\nof States.\r\nHumanity has pinned great hopes on the United\r\nNations, an Organization born of a world war which was\r\ndestructive to great hopes. Humanity entertained the\r\nexpectation that the Organization would succeed in\r\noutlawing war, ending all forms of aggression and\r\nchampioning the right of peoples to self-determination. It\r\nfurther expected it to succeed in achieving development and\r\nin eradicating poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nToday, as we stand at the threshold of a new\r\ncentury, we all face great challenges which require us to\r\nfind the appropriate enabling environment for future\r\ngenerations to live in peace, security and cooperation\r\nwithin the context of international relations free of\r\nviolence and confrontation. This is the hope of our\r\npeoples and this is what we must strive to reach as we\r\nlook forward to a better future that is more just and more\r\nhumane for the benefit of all mankind.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nMalawi, His Excellency The Honourable Mr. Mapopa\r\nChipeta, MP, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Chipeta (Malawi): I would like to extend my\r\nsincere congratulations to the President on his assumption\r\nof the office of the presidency of the fifty-second session\r\nof the United Nations General Assembly. His election to\r\npreside during this critical stage of change and reform in\r\nthe United Nations system is a reflection of the\r\nconfidence that the entire membership has in him and his\r\ncountry, Ukraine. I wish him a successful term of office,\r\nand assure him of Malawi’s full cooperation.\r\nAllow me to pay tribute to last year’s President, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail, for the excellent manner in\r\nwhich he handled the recently concluded fifty-first session\r\nof the General Assembly. President Razali Ismail brought\r\nwith him a refreshing sense of purpose in the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the United Nations. His\r\npunctuality and forthrightness are attributes which will\r\ninspire us all as we move forward. My delegation wishes\r\nhim well in all his future endeavours.\r\nSpecial tribute is due to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, within a short period of time, has\r\ndemonstrated that a revitalized United Nations can work\r\nmeaningfully towards the full realization of the principles\r\nand purposes of the Charter. He can count on Malawi’s\r\nsupport as he continues to discharge his responsibilities.\r\nMalawi welcomes the reforms that are taking place\r\nwithin the Organization. The Secretary-General’s\r\ncommendable efforts in this regard will surely\r\ncomplement the work that has been, and continues to be,\r\nundertaken through the various intergovernmental\r\nprocesses. My delegation expresses its satisfaction with\r\nthe recent adoption of the report of the General\r\nAssembly’s High-level Open-ended Working Group on\r\nthe Strengthening of the United Nations System. By\r\nfocusing attention on the institutional aspects and\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\noperations of the United Nations, the outcome of the\r\nWorking Group represents an indispensable input to the\r\noverall programme of reform. The two-track programme of\r\nreform submitted to us by the Secretary General adds, in\r\nour view, a comprehensive and useful thrust in the reform\r\nand transformation of this world body. My delegation looks\r\nforward to participating in the consultations that are\r\nnecessary to carry through these proposals during this\r\nsession.\r\nWe welcome, too, the conclusion of negotiations on\r\nAn Agenda for Development. We need a strong United\r\nNations in development — a United Nations that is\r\nefficient, effective, relevant, able and well-resourced, to\r\nrespond to the many needs of Member States. Such an\r\nOrganization, however, cannot exist without meaningful\r\nprogress in the other areas of reform. We therefore look for\r\nsome tangible progress in the work of the Working Groups\r\non An Agenda for Peace, on Security Council reform and\r\non the financial situation of the United Nations during the\r\ncurrent session.\r\nLast year my delegation observed that Malawi did not\r\nbelieve that the Working Groups that we had established\r\nwere open-ended in time. We continue to hold this view.\r\nWe need to seize the opportunity for change when the time\r\nis ripe. While a time-frame may not be imposed, we believe\r\nthe time for change for the Organization is now, as we\r\napproach the next millennium. Progress in the three\r\nremaining Working Groups will make complete the changes\r\nthat we all seek for the Organization.\r\nIt is now over three years since the dawn of true\r\ndemocracy in Malawi. The Government of Malawi\r\ncontinues to work towards consolidation of good\r\ngovernance and respect for human rights. We seek to build\r\na Malawi that is democratic and economically viable.\r\nMalawi has made commendable efforts to improve the\r\npromotion, protection and enforcement of human rights. A\r\nnumber of independent institutions for the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights are now in place.\r\nLet me also note that Malawi has acceded to the major\r\ninternational human rights instruments. With regard to the\r\nSecond Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on\r\nCivil and Political Rights aiming at the Abolition of the\r\nDeath Penalty, the Government has decided to hold national\r\nconsultations on whether or not the death penalty should be\r\nabolished. The initiative, whose modalities are being\r\nworked out, has received wide publicity. In this regard, I\r\nwish to register Malawi’s appreciation for the offer of\r\nassistance by Amnesty International to facilitate these\r\nconsultations. In the meantime, our President, His\r\nExcellency Dr. Bakili Muluzi, has announced a stay until\r\nthe outcome of the national consultations is known.\r\nWith respect to the combat of illicit trafficking in\r\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, Malawi has\r\nacceded to the 1988 Convention, and activities are under\r\nway to put in place an effective administrative machinery\r\nto coordinate the activities of government departments\r\nand civil society. We expect to establish a national\r\ncommission on drug control as a focal point for internal\r\nand international activities, including the promotion of\r\ncooperation within the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) region in the fight against drug-\r\ntrafficking. Malawi would greatly appreciate any\r\nassistance from the international community, including the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme, to\r\nimprove our own and the region’s ability to deal with the\r\ndrug problem.\r\nWe continue to make strides in socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. Against the background of prudent\r\neconomic management, we have succeeded in arresting\r\nrising inflation and the stagnation in industry and\r\nconstruction as well as the total loss of confidence in the\r\nbusiness sector. Although the situation is currently\r\nmanageable, we are the first to realize that much more\r\nneeds to be done. Like many other small countries, our\r\neconomy continues to weather stormy turbulence caused\r\nby many exogenous factors. Drought has wrought havoc\r\nin the region in recent years. According to the current\r\nforecast, this season the region will experience yet\r\nanother drought. Poverty continues to be the main source\r\nof concern. There is no doubt that democracy in Malawi\r\nhas engendered massive expectations among the people,\r\nespecially after having lived in an atmosphere of\r\ndeprivation for decades. The level of expectation has\r\ngenerated insurmountable pressure on the limited\r\nresources which the Government has at its disposal.\r\nAs a developing country, and one of the least\r\ndeveloped among them, we are not yet able to mobilize\r\nadequate resources to accomplish all our national\r\ndevelopment programmes. Recurrent drought in the\r\nsouthern Africa region this decade, the weak economic\r\nbase of the country, which is almost exclusively\r\nagricultural, a rather unbalanced social infrastructure,\r\nwhich is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from\r\nthe previous regime, and the problem of disease,\r\nincluding HIV/AIDS, pose a serious threat to our nascent\r\ndemocracy. A combination of these domestic as well as\r\nother factors of an international character bear the\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nfrightening potential of reversing the noble gains we have\r\nmade over the past three years.\r\nDespite these adverse forces, the Government is\r\ndetermined to broaden the economic base of our country.\r\nPolitical stability now obtaining in the country has created\r\na conducive atmosphere for foreign investment. Malawi has\r\nabolished all retrogressive legislation which hindered both\r\ndomestic and foreign investment. The economy has been\r\nliberalized, and a number of incentives have been\r\nintroduced for potential investors. Measures include a\r\ncomprehensive privatization programme.\r\nIn a further effort to tackle the root cause of poverty\r\nin my country, our Government has instituted measures\r\nwhich seek to empower the common person, including\r\nyouth, and women. Free primary education was introduced\r\nin 1994 to develop our human resources. This is coupled\r\nwith the provision of free tuition at secondary school for\r\nthe girl child. The aim of the Malawi Government is to\r\ndouble the average literacy rate by 1999.\r\nThe efforts and impact of globalization are well-known\r\nto us all. Malawi cannot go it alone in the implementation\r\nof its development programmes. International cooperation\r\namong all nations in all sectors of human endeavour is no\r\nlonger an option, but necessary for the very existence and\r\nsurvival of humankind. The truth of this proposition is very\r\napparent and clear today, particularly in the areas of\r\nenvironment, development and international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe in Malawi recognize the importance of protecting\r\nthe environment for the sustainable livelihood of all the\r\npeople. The Government of Malawi participated in the\r\nnineteenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted\r\nto the overall review and appraisal of the implementation of\r\nAgenda 21, held in this very Hall from 23 to 27 June 1997.\r\nWe trust that having candidly taken stock of the state of\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, and taking into account the\r\nshortfall at mid-decade, the international community will\r\nnow redouble its efforts to fulfil its commitments in the\r\nnext five years and beyond. The common and differentiated\r\nresponsibilities that were agreed upon at the Earth Summit\r\nregarding the protection and preservation of the\r\nenvironment in order to achieve sustainable development\r\nwere reaffirmed and accentuated, once again underscoring\r\nthe importance of international cooperation. We will play\r\nour part in the protection of the environment for the benefit\r\nof present and future generations.\r\nThe critical socio-economic situation of Africa\r\ncontinues to be an area of priority concern to us. More\r\nthan one year after the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, the situation still leaves\r\nsomething to be desired — though there are, of course,\r\nsome hopeful signs for improvement. We find\r\ngratification in the fact that African ownership of African\r\ndevelopment is becoming a reality. We look forward to\r\nthe consolidation of a global partnership for Africa.\r\nMalawi appreciates the assistance that it receives from the\r\ndonor community. There is absolutely no doubt that\r\nincreased international assistance and initiatives for debt\r\nrelief or cancellation, increased official development\r\nassistance to meet agreed targets, private capital flows,\r\nincreased foreign direct investment, and improved terms\r\nof trade would play a catalytic role in Africa’s efforts to\r\nachieve economic development. The remarkable progress\r\nachieved in the areas of regional integration and South-\r\nSouth cooperation gives us hope. Africa is indeed not a\r\nhopeless case. A genuine partnership in development and\r\nfinance is, therefore, imperative.\r\nThe demise of the cold war rekindled all our\r\naspirations for lasting global peace and prosperity. The\r\nhighly symbolic tumbling down of the Berlin Wall\r\nheightened expectations for a peace dividend.\r\nUnfortunately, the situation has not improved. Today, the\r\nUnited Nations continues to utilize most of its resources\r\nin managing or containing conflicts of varying origins and\r\nintensity. The role of the Organization in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security has become more\r\nrelevant than before. The situations in Angola, Burundi,\r\nthe Republic of the Congo, the Great Lakes Region,\r\nSierra Leone, Western Sahara, Afghanistan, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the Middle East, among many others,\r\ncontinue to occupy the work of this Organization.\r\nIt certainly should be possible to resolve many of\r\nthese problems that beset the world so that the United\r\nNations can rechannel its efforts towards promoting the\r\nmost refreshing aspects of the human experience. And\r\nthere are many examples where the human spirit has\r\ntriumphed over forces of doom and despair.\r\nDevelopments in Liberia and in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo are among the most recent examples.\r\nWe congratulate the people of Liberia on choosing\r\nthe way of peace. The role played by the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), by the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States Monitoring\r\nGroup, and by other international observers in the\r\nLiberian peace and electoral processes once again\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\ndemonstrates that a global partnership for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security can succeed and is\r\nperhaps the only way forward.\r\nDemocracy, transparent and accountable governance\r\nand the protection and promotion of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms are necessary for successful people-\r\ncentred development to take place in our countries. It is\r\nunfortunate, though, that there are some around us today\r\nwho believe that they can continue to deprive their own\r\npeople of their birth rights and freedoms. We deeply regret\r\nthat in Sierra Leone a military junta that usurped power\r\nfrom a democratically elected Government is still holding\r\non, in spite of the international community’s opposition.\r\nMalawi calls upon the junta to hand over power to the\r\ndemocratically elected Government and President Kabbah\r\nso that the people of Sierra Leone can experience the peace\r\nthat has eluded them for so long.\r\nThe situation in Burundi continues to be as depressing\r\nas it was last year. We remain convinced that there is no\r\nalternative to freedom and democracy. We strongly urge the\r\npeople of Burundi to set aside their differences and\r\nnegotiate so that they may put in place a Government that\r\nwould bring that country once again to normalcy.\r\nMy Government has followed closely developments in\r\nthe painstaking peace process for Angola. We have admired\r\nthe magnanimity of the Government of Angola in fulfilling\r\nits obligations under the Lusaka Protocol and related\r\nagreements. We on the other hand regret the continued\r\nintransigence of Dr. Jonas Savimbi and his National Union\r\nfor the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). While\r\nsupporting wholeheartedly the Security Council resolutions\r\non the situation in Angola, we make an earnest appeal to\r\nthe UNITA leadership to fulfil its obligations in the peace\r\nprocess without further delay so that the people of Angola\r\nand the entire southern African region may realize their\r\ndesire for a peaceful and prosperous future.\r\nWe similarly regret the recent developments in the\r\nRepublic of the Congo. We appeal to all the major players\r\nin this senseless struggle to exercise restraint and amicably\r\nresolve their differences. The Congolese people definitely\r\ndeserve much better.\r\nWe note with growing concern the apparent lack of\r\nmeaningful progress in the implementation of the settlement\r\nplan for Western Sahara. Malawi applauds the indefatigable\r\nefforts of the United Nations in its search for a lasting\r\nsolution to Western Sahara. It is our sincere hope that the\r\nrecent appointment by the Secretary-General of Mr. James\r\nBaker as his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara will help\r\nin the resolution of that problem. We call upon the main\r\nactors to honour their obligations without further delay.\r\nMy delegation is gravely concerned about\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East. A few years back, we\r\nhailed the Middle East peace process as having acquired\r\nirreversible momentum. Malawi strongly believes that\r\nthere is no alternative to the peace process launched in\r\nMadrid on 10 October 1991; there is no cogent alternative\r\nto this process for genuine peace and stability in the\r\nMiddle East. However, recent developments have\r\nobviously shown that any provocative moves by any of\r\nthe parties concerned will not help the process. We appeal\r\nfor the utmost restraint and the quick resumption of\r\nnegotiations.\r\nMy Government is similarly pleased to note that the\r\ntwo Governments on the Korean peninsula are working\r\ntogether, although in a limited sense. It is our hope that\r\nthis is a starting point from which a lasting solution to the\r\nexisting tensions on the peninsula will be realized.\r\nIn recent years the world has made major strides in\r\nthe field of disarmament. The adoption last year of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was indeed a\r\nmajor breakthrough for all peace-loving nations. For\r\nMalawi, however, the recent adoption of the Convention\r\non the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction stands out as most significant. Our resolve to\r\nroot out an evil that has adversely affected the lives of\r\nmany in the world shall remain undeterred. The support\r\ngarnered for the Convention within a short period of time\r\nis a clear sign of what human beings can achieve when\r\nworking together for a common goal. We welcome the\r\nConvention and look forward to its universal acceptance.\r\nThe United Nations today stands at the threshold of\r\na new millennium. We pray that it continues to play its\r\nrightful role in the many issues that occupy us all in our\r\neveryday life. As we approach the twenty-first century,\r\nthe relevance of the United Nations in enhancing\r\ninternational cooperation in all areas of human endeavour\r\nis, to us, no longer a matter of doubt but reality. We\r\nbelieve that the reforms we all desire will harness the\r\ngains already made in the area of international\r\ncooperation. We all seek a United Nations that responds\r\neffectively and efficiently to the needs of all people.\r\nLet me reaffirm the commitment of the Government\r\nand the people of Malawi to the noble goals and ideals of\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nthe United Nations, an institution that continues to make a\r\ndifference for humankind. We will continue to make our\r\nmodest contribution to this intergovernmental process, for\r\nwhich we find no credible or viable alternative to its service\r\nto “We the peoples of the United Nations”.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nCuba, Mr. Roberto Robaina González.\r\nMr. Robaina González (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Ernesto Che Guevara, Commander, Minister and\r\nhead of the Cuban delegation to the nineteenth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, stated 33 years ago, from this very\r\nrostrum:\r\n“We wish to see this Assembly stretch its limbs\r\nand march forward; we want the Committees to begin\r\ntheir work, which should not stop at the first\r\nconfrontation.” [Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Nineteenth Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n1299th meeting, para. 81]\r\nAnd, as if he could already see the present, he added:\r\n“Imperialism seeks to convert this meeting into a\r\npointless competition in oratory, to prevent it from\r\nsolving the serious problems of the world; that design\r\nwe must frustrate.” (Ibid.)\r\nAt that time, on our planet some 700 million people\r\nwere illiterate; 200 million were unemployed; and over 1\r\nbillion were eking out a precarious existence. That reality\r\ncontravened the principle that humans are the source of\r\ndevelopment, as well as its agents and beneficiaries, and\r\nshould be considered, above all, as the justification and\r\npurpose of development.\r\nAs the years went by, the situation worsened. Today,\r\nnot only are the industrialized nations imposing conditions\r\non or denying outright a meagre share of their plentiful\r\nresources as official development assistance for the\r\ndevelopment of the poorest nations, but some of them, like\r\nostriches, are burying their head in the sand and\r\ndisregarding that obligation.\r\nAlthough missions to Mars are widely publicized and\r\nassurances are given that the world economy is growing,\r\nthe distressing truth remains that today in the world a\r\nbillion people are illiterate; as many are unemployed or\r\nunderemployed; and more than 2 billion are living under\r\nsubhuman conditions.\r\nAmong these, we note with dismay, are the 425,000\r\nchildren worldwide who, since Tuesday, 16 September,\r\nwhen this session started, have died from preventable\r\ndiseases. Those 425,000 children were sacrificed in the\r\nname of efficiency, quality and consumption — a pattern\r\nof consumption that today requires an irrational and\r\nunsustainable development, to which those children never\r\neven had access.\r\nTime is not just slipping by; we are letting it slip\r\nthrough our fingers. With it, we are losing also our\r\nopportunities to save our planet, which is sick and beset\r\nin a thousand ways because the men and women who\r\nhave been gathering here for the last 52 years on behalf\r\nof our peoples have in many cases been unable\r\nconsistently to translate words into deeds.\r\nWhy, on the threshold of a new century, should we\r\nallow such a crime to take place? Where is that promised\r\nland, that higher society, that paradise craved by millions\r\nof human beings? How can we dream today, when the\r\noverwhelming majority of human beings cannot even\r\nsleep because violence, hunger and disease keep them\r\nawake?\r\nOver five decades ago, the nations of the world\r\ndecided to unite against war and to work in peace for\r\nprogress and cooperation among peoples. But since then,\r\nno one has enjoyed real and lasting peace. As many\r\npeople have become the victims of violence and armed\r\nconflicts in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall as\r\nwere killed in the 15-year Viet Nam war.\r\nOur memory has become so short that those same\r\npeople who raised their voices against the German\r\ncapital’s concrete wall now justify, promote and even\r\nstand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily\r\nfortified wall that would divide the poor South from the\r\ndeveloped North, along the Rio Grande all the way to\r\nBaja California, and which very few dare to denounce.\r\nLikewise, an absurd hypocrisy allows military\r\nexpenditures to be the number one business in the world,\r\nwith close to $900 billion in circulation, followed by drug\r\nsmuggling, with upwards of $500 billion, while as much\r\nmoney is invested in a modern bomber as would be\r\nrequired to relieve the foreign debt of the 20 countries\r\nmost heavily burdened by that scourge.\r\n“Divide and conquer”: the Roman maxim for\r\nsubduing the ancient world is increasingly and ever more\r\nforcefully becoming the slogan of the era of outer space\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nand information superhighways. The only form of concerted\r\naction that seems to be fully consolidated is the one that,\r\nfrom here, proposes and undertakes humanitarian\r\ninterventions and operations aimed at enforcing,\r\nmaintaining or consolidating peace and democracy in the\r\nwake of conflicts; preventive and early-warning actions; and\r\nall those various ways of disguising new wars.\r\nIf we fail to stop this, the upcoming third millennium\r\nwill not find peaceful and generous comity among nations.\r\nNor will it bring any closer the anticipated miracle of\r\nmultiplying loaves and fishes for all through development\r\nand rational exchange. On the contrary, consumerism,\r\nenvironmental deterioration, illiteracy, xenophobia,\r\nterrorism, drug addiction, famine, AIDS, prostitution and all\r\nthose visible symptoms of the human rationality\r\nimmunodeficiency syndrome that our planet is suffering\r\nfrom will devour us. Can it be, as one poet says, that\r\npeople are mean and undeserving and we should therefore\r\naccept the idea that the already foreseen end of history will\r\nbe followed by the end of the human race?\r\nIf we resign ourselves to the fact that 285 people can\r\npossess riches equal to the ill-apportioned wealth of 2.5\r\nbillion other human beings, it might be that a doomsday of\r\nsimilar proportions awaits us should we fail to change the\r\ncourse of events. Just one detail: were it not for the 2.5\r\nbillion people doomed to sacrifice, it would be very\r\nunlikely that the other 285 people could survive, regardless\r\nof how much more wealth they would be able to\r\naccumulate.\r\nAll these problems belong to this world, not another.\r\nThey are ours, as much as these “Disunited Nations”, which\r\nwe are unable to cast into a true gathering of Governments\r\nand peoples designed to change and save our planet.\r\nIn the light of these problems, many of us wonder\r\nwhether the words of a powerful minority are worth more\r\nthan the lives of that overwhelming majority of human\r\nbeings who for many reasons are not only deprived of their\r\nright to say a word, but also lack the resolution and the\r\npower to exercise that right when they do have it.\r\nWe also wonder how there can be talk of\r\nmultilateralism when we see an endlessly increasing\r\nunilateralism and when the so-called de-ideologized world\r\nimposes on us a sole and exclusive ideology. Something is\r\nwrong when speeches on plurality are made while attempts\r\nare made to impose uniformity on the world; things are\r\neven worse if, instead of everyone having the same rights\r\nand duties — as should be the case — in fact, a few have\r\nmore and more rights whereas the vast majority only get\r\nmore and more duties.\r\nWe dedicated the decade which is just concluding to\r\ninternational law with a view to honouring it with\r\nconcrete actions. However, in this very building there\r\nhave been talks and negotiations about, and even votes\r\nagainst, these principles and international law itself. We\r\nshould ask ourselves once again when we will actually\r\nconclude the agreements on nuclear disarmament, and\r\nwhen the use of force or threats will be once and for all\r\nbanned in international relations. Why allow certain\r\nPowers to pursue with impunity the arms race, their\r\nmilitary hegemony and the defiant nuclear tests in\r\nlaboratories and computers while they try to ban them for\r\nthe rest?\r\nHow can we stop those who split whole nations\r\napart, prevent their peaceful reunification and finance and\r\narm regimes that violate human rights? All the\r\nendeavours to establish a new, just and equitable\r\neconomic world order, free of humiliating conditions and\r\nrestrictive and onerous practices, are brutally challenged\r\nby a powerful minority that reserves the worst and\r\ncruellest of the infernos for the rest of the planet.\r\nA handful of the rich will never be able to represent\r\nthe vast multitudes of human beings, deprived every day\r\nof their right to know that they are human, multitudes on\r\nwhom cultural transnationalization imposes an information\r\norder capable of homogenizing even the news of their\r\nvery lives. Nor can one accept that the select club should\r\ndecree in a totalitarian way the political and juridical\r\norder of the peoples, without even asking who we are,\r\nwhere we are coming from and what we rely upon to go\r\nwhere we sovereignly wish. Those belonging to that club,\r\nand they alone, are the ones primarily responsible for the\r\nfact that today cardinal principles of international law,\r\nsuch as self-determination, national independence, non-\r\ninterference in domestic affairs, and particularly respect\r\nfor the sovereignty of States are questioned.\r\nThat is why Cuba asserts our right to differ, and\r\nwhy we reiterate the position expressed by our President\r\nmore than three decades ago:\r\n“As long as the concept of sovereignty exists as a\r\nprerogative of nations and independent peoples, as a\r\nright of all peoples, we do not accept the exclusion\r\nof our people from that right. As long as the world\r\nis guided by those principles, as long as the world is\r\nguided by those concepts, which have universal\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nvalidity, because they are universally accepted and\r\nenshrined by the peoples, we will not accept being\r\ndeprived of any of those rights; we will not relinquish\r\nany of those rights.”\r\nFor us there is absolutely no doubt that sovereignty\r\ncontinues to be a concept and a prerogative of independent\r\nStates, and that in today’s unipolar world that principle has\r\neven more force and validity than ever before.\r\nEconomies, cultures and peoples are subjugated under\r\nthe drum roll of globalization; development becomes as\r\nremote as stars to which we cannot travel, and wealth is\r\nincreasingly polarized. Under the impulse of this\r\nglobalization, vaunted new technological and scientific\r\ndisplays are poisoning the environment, crushing\r\nbiodiversity and condemning to extinction the most\r\nprecarious and wonderful of all species: mankind.\r\nIt would be good if that global interdependency could\r\nstop the frantic consumption, balance national development\r\npatterns, make economies sustainable and multiply the\r\nriches of the peoples. Even better, if ideas are to be truly\r\nglobalized, let us welcome the clamour for urgent reform of\r\nthis United Nations, as remote from its own origins as it is\r\nunable to cope with the era in which we are living. That\r\ncould be dreamt of, if at least the reform started with a\r\ncomprehensive and inclusive endeavour, democratizing all\r\nits bodies while preserving its universal character, its\r\npolitical essence and its intergovernmental nature.\r\nIt is high time to go beyond the rhetoric in which we\r\nhave been immersed for two years, since we celebrated the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Organization with talk of reform,\r\nwith talk about transformations, without saying what, who,\r\nhow and when. If we are to be occupied, and not only\r\npreoccupied, with reform, let us reject, as incompatible with\r\nthis Organization, the corporate and transnational approach\r\npromoted by some of the main United Nations contributors,\r\nas if this building were a stock exchange and the just\r\ndesires of the peoples were mere merchandise.\r\nThe reforms must permit the General Assembly to\r\nreally exercise its prerogatives, including those which have\r\nbeen usurped, while preserving the principle of equality of\r\nall Member States, whose genuine political will is essential\r\nto advance. Intergovernmental participation in considering\r\nand adopting decisions on any reform package should be a\r\nfundamental precondition if we really want to tend to the\r\nneeds of the historically forgotten majority in the world.\r\nLikewise, our peoples, especially the poorest ones, will\r\nunderstand only those decisions that are reflected in their\r\nlives and homes — not those that satisfy only their\r\nGovernments.\r\nCuba also advocates reform that especially\r\nstrengthens United Nations structures and activities that\r\nare related to the promotion of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The simplification, rationalization or\r\nreorientation of those structures must be the result of a\r\nprocess that always guarantees full completion and\r\nimplementation of all programmes, mandates and\r\nactivities in those areas.\r\nThe United Nations should recover its real decision-\r\nmaking capacity in other critical issues, such as those\r\nrelated to free trade, development financing and other\r\nmonetary topics. Any measure handing that role over to\r\nthe main contributors must be blocked.\r\nFurther, we should all endorse again the Charter\r\nobligation to contribute to stable and unconditional\r\nfinancing, making possible the effective and efficient\r\nimplementation of all programmes, priorities, mandates\r\nand activities approved by the General Assembly. The\r\napproval of a budget for each programme reflecting the\r\ntotal resources required for the Organization to carry out\r\nall its activities will be a cornerstone of that endeavour.\r\nAlong these lines, we oppose any formula based on\r\nthe extortion and pressure that are exerted by some\r\ncountries, particularly by the country which is the main\r\ncontributor to the United Nations — as well as its deepest\r\ndebtor, economically and morally speaking.\r\nBut to achieve the more democratic, efficient and\r\ndynamic United Nations we are dreaming of, it is\r\nessential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its\r\nprincipal organs: the Security Council must stop being a\r\nbunker impenetrable to the General Assembly’s demands\r\nfor an equitable and fair expansion. While some of the\r\nrichest and most powerful States are already taking long\r\nstrides towards any new seats that might appear, there are\r\nattempts to mislead, and even to deny the right of the\r\nthird world to its due representation on the Council on an\r\nequal footing with the rest of the permanent members.\r\nWorse yet, the saw of division is once again cutting\r\nthrough the body of the poor to the benefit of the big\r\nindustrialized countries.\r\nLet us reach agreement once and for all. If we want\r\nreal security, what we agree upon must not further\r\nincrease the appalling imbalances that today insult and\r\nexterminate us. Hence the importance of reforming the\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\ncomposition and procedures of the Security Council, and of\r\nrectifying the largest existing imbalance, by enabling\r\ndeveloping countries to become members based on\r\nequitable geographical representation and simultaneity of\r\naccession by new members.\r\nThe Council will never be secure until transparency,\r\ndemocracy and the participation of non-member States\r\nforever take the place of the present dangerous and\r\nconcealed manoeuvres. Peace will never be guaranteed until\r\nthe obsolete and antidemocratic institution of the veto\r\ndisappears, or is at least restricted pending its final\r\nelimination. That is the only way to prevent the abuses of\r\npower that today prevail in this Organization and in the\r\nSecurity Council. By confronting these abuses together, we\r\nwill prevent the coercive policies and unilateral measures\r\ngenerated by certain States from becoming multilateral.\r\nI know a teenager who is the pride of his parents. He\r\nlikes baseball, is a good student and dreams an ocean of\r\ndreams. But it has recently been discovered that he suffers\r\nfrom leukaemia. The medicines to cure him exist, and the\r\ntreatment could cost less than $15,000 if we act in time.\r\nCuba has been forced to arrange a discrete transaction to\r\nobtain through friendly third parties, and at a total cost of\r\n$60,000, the medicines to save that child’s life.\r\nThat is the blockade: for the price of four treatments,\r\nwe could afford only one. With the money to save four\r\nlives, only one will be saved. But this is not the only\r\nexample. Despite its very limited income, Cuba continues\r\nto pay hundreds of millions of dollars in price differences,\r\nsurcharges, freight and other additional charges in its\r\nimports of fuel, food, medicines and other basic products.\r\nFinancial credits crucial for the economic recovery and\r\ngrowth were suspended or postponed or became more\r\nexpensive, while all markets labelled us as a “risk” for fear\r\nof the unilateral punishment that could fall on Governments\r\nand banks if they lent us money.\r\nOn top of all of that, and because of the protectionism\r\nof pharmaceutical patents, Cubans have been deprived of\r\nfree access to medicines that have appeared on the market\r\nsince 1979, including third-generation antibiotics and other\r\ndrugs to treat AIDS and cancer.\r\nCuba has no need to exaggerate the facts. It suffers\r\nthem first, contemplates them afterwards, and always\r\nexposes them with a calm sense of responsibility. The tale\r\nof a giant Goliath against a small David could have been\r\ntaken from the Bible, but the minstrels and chroniclers of\r\nthe next millennium will find plenty of inspiration in the\r\nconflict between the United States and Cuba.\r\nAlmost 40 years of resistance and of defence of our\r\nbold ideals of independence against our brutal neighbour\r\nwho covets and loathes us provide us with the authority\r\nto speak. More than 35 years of struggle against the cruel\r\nand inhumane economic, commercial and financial\r\nblockade by the United States of America support our\r\narguments. Every new charge made by Cuba is supported\r\nby more than $60 billion in losses — and that is not a\r\nfull assessment — by an economy distorted by the war\r\nconditions imposed on us, and by the incalculable human,\r\nphysical and psychological damage we have sustained.\r\nEvery year sees an increase in the number of\r\ncountries that vote by an overwhelming majority to put an\r\nend to that dirty, savage and silent war. Yet the blockade\r\nnot only remains in effect, but has been cruelly and\r\narrogantly strengthened before the very eyes of the world,\r\nwhich remains hamstrung in the face of the power of the\r\nEmpire.\r\nWhere are the courage and bravery that turned our\r\nspecies into a giant? Why should we tolerate the\r\ndiplomacy of intimidation and blackmail? For how long\r\nwill the world sit on its hands and watch so merciless a\r\ncrime?\r\nIt was such impunity that gave free rein to those\r\nwho expedited the enactment of the criminal Helms-\r\nBurton Act as a new escalation of the blockade and as\r\nadditional and convincing proof of a threat that goes\r\nbeyond all borders. It is extraterritorial from top to\r\nbottom, because it was conceived and implemented\r\nagainst another sovereign State, with which they\r\nhypocritically maintain they are not at war; at the same\r\ntime, it is extraterritorial against the rest of the world,\r\nupon which they are attempting to impose the narrow\r\njurisdiction of a clumsy national legal artifice.\r\nThis abhorred and oft-condemned imperial recipe has\r\nnot met with any actions forceful enough to stop it. Its\r\nadoption gave rise to other aberrations, such as the\r\nD’Amato-Kennedy Act; and state and federal legislation\r\nof the same kind proliferates in that country.\r\nSimilar measures already affect more than 35\r\nsovereign States — that is, 2.3 billion people, accounting\r\nfor 42 per cent of the world’s population and a potential\r\nmarket of $790 billion. These data, provided by the\r\nUnited States President’s Advisory Council on Export\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nControl and the American Institute for International\r\nEconomy, prove that such extraterritorial policies also result\r\nin harm to the American people themselves, who in one\r\nyear alone lost half a million jobs and more than $1 billion\r\nin salaries because of them.\r\nInsane politicians and legislators end up by restricting\r\nthe very values of freedom upon which that great country\r\nwas founded and, in its name, prevent millions of American\r\nyouth from gaining access to information about a world\r\nfestival of youth and students held in Havana last summer.\r\nThose who attempt today to cross that new iron curtain risk\r\n$250,000 dollar fines and up to 10 years in prison. Despite\r\nthose threats, about a thousand young men and women\r\nfrom the United States challenged the veto on their\r\nfreedom — no one could prevent them — and attended the\r\nHavana festival anyway.\r\nSuch policies and concepts also affect the vast\r\nmajority of our countrymen living in the United States, for\r\nyears victims of criminal organizations and their hirelings\r\nbased in Miami, used in the dirtiest deals and electoral\r\nmanoeuvres, and even used as cannon fodder against their\r\nown people and their own motherland. Among them, a\r\nsilent majority of immigrants is emerging ever stronger\r\nevery day, rejecting the genocide against their motherland.\r\nDespite all this, the raving obsession of the reactionary\r\ncircles never seems to stop, as a true tyranny attempts\r\nincreasingly to reach out for the goal of world power.\r\nToday, new bills are being debated in the Congress in\r\nWashington, blooming under the shelter of instruments\r\nalready approved in the Helms-Burton legal atrocity.\r\nToday, independent nations are being bullied every six\r\nmonths so that they can obtain a sovereignty certificate\r\nfrom the White House Oval Office to avoid retaliation for\r\ntheir relations with Cuba.\r\nToday, attempts to curb free trade with false excuses\r\nof national security are jolting the newly born World Trade\r\nOrganization, and their doubtful seriousness begins to worry\r\nthe most distinguished United States authorities.\r\nToday, deals are made behind the backs of peoples,\r\nGovernments and Parliaments to impose moratoriums on\r\ninvestments, and secret pseudo-legal arguments, based on\r\ndubious morality, are concocted to disguise the\r\nshamelessness of those who yield to pressure.\r\nToday, there are blacklists of foreign companies and\r\nbusinessmen who do not submit to the rules, therefore\r\nbeing denied entry to that country, which regards itself as\r\nsuper-free. Visas are also denied to their spouses and\r\nchildren, to force them to yield to the empire’s will.\r\nToday, there are Governments that receive or await\r\ncertificates of good democratic behaviour, certificates that\r\nthey are defenders of selected and manipulated rights or\r\nare outstanding anti-drug enforcers, in order to gain\r\naccess to a fast track to a free trade agreement, a trade\r\ncredit or development aid.\r\nToday, European citizens are being blackmailed by\r\nattorneys, indicted and unjustly found guilty by United\r\nStates courts, which boast about their impartiality, under\r\nsuch illegalities as the Helms-Burton Act.\r\nToday, there are imperialist diplomats, clones of\r\npolicemen, who share the stage with famous Hollywood\r\nstars and who parade arrogantly among the Governments\r\nand Parliaments of the world, with their siren song and\r\ntheir well-known threats and offers of charity in exchange\r\nfor the most abject complicity.\r\nAll of this madness has revived official and covert\r\noperations, mercenaries, spies and assassins, as ready now\r\nas in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash\r\nterror against human beings and even employ aggressive\r\nbiological agents against our economy.\r\nNo one, absolutely no one, has lifted a finger in the\r\nUnited States Government to stop them. Diehard sectors\r\nhave usurped their constitutional rights in order to\r\nexercise that power, and are obstructing them in the\r\nmeanest and pettiest way.\r\nThe same gang of ultraconservatives and gangsters\r\nis responsible for the acquittal of hijackers and impedes\r\nthe use of the term “terrorists”, while with a silent and\r\nmysterious complicity they are bolstered, funded,\r\norganized, armed, trained and assigned to intelligence\r\nmissions.\r\nDisguised as tourists, defenders of human rights or\r\nphilanthropists, those who today stir up greater and more\r\npainful confrontations between Cuba and the United\r\nStates are identical to those who 35 years ago were\r\ninvolved in the climate of aggression which led to the\r\nmissile crisis in October 1962.\r\nUnfortunately, there are people in the world who do\r\nnot see, or, even worse, do not want to see, these facts,\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nand from their sanctuaries they worry about our problems,\r\nstudy us, advise us to surrender, design our future with the\r\nsame ingredients as our past, and even urge us to bear\r\neverything with the utmost patience.\r\nBelieve me, it is very hard to understand, for example,\r\nthe uneasiness caused by the lack of a variety of dishes on\r\nthe Cuban table, when there is not the least concern for the\r\nmillions of human beings to their south without tables or\r\ndishes, and often without even a slice of bread. We shall\r\nnever understand or accept the longed-for renunciation of\r\nwhat we are and what we have been as the contemptible\r\nprice that the people of socialist Cuba, like any other\r\npeople in the world, should pay for an uncertain\r\ncoexistence with a neighbour as disrespectful and arrogant\r\nas it is powerful.\r\nThe moral and legal support of 136 votes in this\r\nAssembly encourages and comforts us in our struggle. But\r\nit has not been enough to overcome the persistent arrogance\r\nof the one who thinks himself the divine judge and lacks\r\nthe humility to admit the failure of a mistaken policy.\r\nAlthough their representatives may, as usual, leave the\r\nChamber, we know they are listening. Therefore, on behalf\r\nof the people of free Cuba we wish them to know and to\r\nconvey to their Government and Congress that we have\r\nabsolutely no fear of them.\r\nWe also know that only international pressure can\r\nprevent these forms of aggression against Cuba, or any\r\nother sovereign State, from multiplying.\r\nFor these reasons, and because of our commitment to\r\nthe millions of Cubans whom we represent and on whose\r\nbehalf we now speak, we confirm that if our stubborn will\r\nto resist costs us our lives, so be it a thousand times over.\r\nNever shall we submit again to being slaves of a haughty\r\nand arrogant empire that refuses to recognize pluralism or\r\nboundaries, an empire that decides to blockade our\r\nexistence and kill all hope.\r\nOur experience confirms to us today, more than ever,\r\nthat only the spirit of sacrifice, the loving, valiant, free and\r\nselfless unity of our people and Government, can give us\r\nthe strength of character of Quixote to stand up to such\r\ngigantic hardships.\r\nThat is how we have been able to resist, along with\r\nthe most generous solidarity and understanding of thousands\r\nof millions of people.\r\nDesiring only the noblest satisfaction, our people\r\nvolunteer and join in the titanic task of putting an end to\r\nthe cataclysms shaking the Earth and fighting for the\r\nadvent of a new millennium of emancipation, peace,\r\nsecurity and development for all nations.\r\nWe ask for nothing, absolutely nothing, in return.\r\nWe can only offer the example of having stoically\r\nendured the harassment of the greatest Power in history,\r\nof maintaining our principles and of continuing to believe,\r\nwork and move forward when many thought we had\r\nstopped and were dying.\r\nThe father of our independence said,\r\n“We Cubans do not seek and do not want anything\r\ngreater than honour, homeland and freedom.\r\nEverything else will come for sure and in bulk after\r\nall that. What we need is to succeed.”\r\nAnd our existence today is reason enough for us to assert\r\nproudly that we have already succeeded.\r\nBecause of that unique experience, we can also say\r\nthat this is a solemn and decisive time.\r\nThe imperial Power that wants to subjugate the\r\nworld is no match for us if we stand together.\r\nWe are a great and very powerful majority.\r\nThere will be no place in history for those who stay\r\non their knees. Let us all rise, united!\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.55 p.m.\r\n32\r\n"
