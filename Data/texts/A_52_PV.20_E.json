(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the chairman of the delegation of Estonia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Trivimi Velliste.\r\nMr. Velliste (Estonia): Mr. President, first of all I\r\nwould like to congratulate you on your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at this session. We wish you\r\nsuccess in this responsible task in a year that will be of\r\ngreat importance for the Organization.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour gratitude to the previous President of the Assembly,\r\nAmbassador Ismail, who showed exceptional commitment\r\nto the reform initiatives throughout the fifty-first session.\r\nThat recently concluded session was an important step\r\ntowards a reinforced United Nations which, with its\r\nuniversal membership, will have to be able to deal with\r\nserious problems facing the world today.\r\nWe expect the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly to be a decisive landmark in the renewal and\r\nrestructuring of the United Nations — a major endeavour\r\nundertaken by Member States several years ago. In this\r\nrespect we would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who presented his report on this question to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 16 July. My Government lends its\r\nfull support to Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his\r\nefforts. We also note with satisfaction that part of this\r\npackage has already been implemented.\r\nEstonia is looking forward to an agreement within\r\nthe foreseeable future concerning a response by Member\r\nStates to the Secretary-General’s proposals. It is our\r\nsincere hope that Members will deal with this matter in a\r\nconstructive manner and that a generally acceptable\r\nscheme for reforming the United Nations will be agreed\r\nupon. We are confident that all Member States will\r\nbenefit from the reform of the Organization.\r\nI would now like to focus my address on points of\r\nspecific relevance to present needs in the reform package.\r\nThe aim of reform as a whole is to adapt the Organization\r\nto its new challenges, to make it more effective and\r\nefficient, more manageable and modern in every way. We\r\nare now remodelling this Organization to make it\r\ncompatible with the twenty-first century. The world has\r\nchanged — the United Nations has to change with it.\r\nHaving criteria for the appraisal of performance seems to\r\nbe of crucial importance. Result-based budgeting should\r\nassure a strengthened linkage between intergovernmental\r\nmandates and their efficient implementation. Enhanced\r\ncost effectiveness envisaged for 1998-1999 is also an\r\nencouraging sign.\r\nEstonia lends strong support to the idea of cutting\r\nthe number of agenda items for future sessions. We also\r\nfind the idea of consolidating the representation of\r\ndifferent United Nations funds and programmes in\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nMember States on common premises and under one flag to\r\nbe very attractive. United Nations Houses would enhance\r\nthe visibility of the Organization and provide a valuable\r\nsource of information about it and its activities. I would\r\nlike to note the positive experience Estonia has gathered in\r\ncooperation with the local United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) country office. Many programmes\r\nvital to Estonia have materialized owing to the support of\r\nthe UNDP. We highly appreciate this cooperation and hope\r\nthat the future United Nations House will be able to use\r\nthat valuable expertise.\r\nThe financing of the United Nations is a question that\r\ninterests all of us. Without adequate financing, the\r\nOrganization would not be able to fulfil its mandate. This\r\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly must assess\r\nthe impact of the Secretary-General’s proposed reforms on\r\nthe programme budget for 1998-1999 and define a new\r\nscale of assessments for its Member States. Estonia\r\nsupports the Secretary-General’s reform measures aimed at\r\nenhancing the Organization’s effectiveness and better\r\nimplementation of its programmes by reducing excessive\r\nand unnecessary expenditures.\r\nWith regard to the new scale of assessments, Estonia\r\nwould like to see a more transparent scale based on the\r\nfundamental principle of capacity to pay to be adopted. All\r\nmeasures should lead towards putting the Organization on\r\na sound and predictable financial footing. We believe that\r\nthe main prerequisite for achieving this goal is that Member\r\nStates clear their arrears to the regular as well as to the\r\npeacekeeping budgets. Estonia is committed to doing so.\r\nWe welcome the appointment of Mrs. Mary Robinson,\r\nformer President of Ireland, to the position of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. Estonia supports the plan\r\nfor the consolidation of the Centre for Human Rights and\r\nthe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\ninto one office. We would also like to stress the importance\r\nthat we attach to adequate financing of the Organization’s\r\nhuman rights machinery.\r\nTwo major events have occurred in the past year in\r\nthe field of economic and social cooperation. The first of\r\nthem was the adoption of the Agenda for Development.\r\nEstonia shares the perception of the importance of\r\ndevelopment issues for the United Nations. Health and\r\neducation should also be high priorities. The second such\r\nevent was the nineteenth special session of the General\r\nAssembly, the aim of which was to review the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, the global plan of action for\r\nsustainable development adopted in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.\r\nAlthough the special session acknowledged the positive\r\nresults which have been achieved since Rio, it also\r\nexpressed concern over worsened overall trends for\r\nsustainable development. In this regard, we expect the\r\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly to give\r\nfurther political impetus to the implementation of the\r\nmandates and tasks defined at the session.\r\nIn Estonia, we believe that our task today is to\r\nprovide the present generation with the safe, good-quality\r\nliving environment and resources needed to promote a\r\nstrong and diversified economy without compromising the\r\nneeds of future generations. For that reason, over the last\r\nfive years Estonia has signed, ratified and acceded to\r\nmore than 40 bilateral and multilateral environment\r\nagreements and conventions. We have also established the\r\nGovernmental Commission on Sustainable Development,\r\nled by the Prime Minister. Estonia is working closely\r\nwith the countries in the Baltic Sea area to develop a\r\nBaltic region sustainable development strategy.\r\nI would like to stress the importance that we attach\r\nto the consideration of economic and social issues by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. With this in view, the work of the\r\nSecond and Third Main Committees should be\r\nrationalized in order to avoid any overlap and duplication.\r\nOne of the central areas of the reform concerns\r\nrenewing the Security Council. This year, Member States\r\nmust continue efforts to achieve the goal of making the\r\nCouncil more representative and to improve its working\r\nmethods. Estonia elaborated its position in cooperation\r\nwith a group of smaller like-minded countries. We\r\nsupport enlargement in both existing categories. We also\r\nview Germany and Japan as potential new permanent\r\nmembers of the Council. The developing countries of\r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America should also be\r\nrepresented on a permanent basis.\r\nDisarmament has been one of the United Nations\r\npriority goals since its founding. In fact, disarmament\r\nefforts have yielded considerable progress. The conclusion\r\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year\r\nwas an important step forward.\r\nOne of the important responsibilities of the United\r\nNations is managing conflicts — acting rapidly in the\r\nface of crises. Peacekeeping continues to be an important\r\nactivity of the Organization. In recent years, we have\r\nbeen witnessing a change in the role of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping missions. United Nations peacekeepers have\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nbeen facing the challenge of dealing with internal conflicts\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nEstonia is continuing to take part in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping. An Estonian company has recently completed\r\nits successful deployment in the United Nations Interim\r\nForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Together with Latvia and\r\nLithuania, we are looking forward to contributing a\r\nbattalion of peacekeepers to the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. The battalion, called BALTBAT,\r\nwill be operational from the beginning of 1998. I would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all Member\r\nStates of the Organization that have been participating in\r\nthis project. The initial experience of Baltic peacekeepers\r\nin United Nations peacekeeping missions has shown how\r\nregional cooperation evolves into global cooperation. The\r\nBaltic preparedness to merge as a joint battalion is an\r\nelement strengthening regional security. It proves our\r\nreadiness to assume responsibility as well as our right to\r\nchoose our own means of security. Estonia is currently\r\ncontributing civilian police officers and military observers.\r\nWe have also joined the United Nations peacekeeping\r\nstandby arrangement.\r\nWe strongly believe in the cooperation of the United\r\nNations with regional organizations in all parts of the\r\nworld. Reliance on the expertise and capacities of these\r\norganizations would allow us to avoid duplication and\r\nallocate scarce resources in the most effective manner. We\r\ndo have examples of fruitful cooperation with regional\r\nentities. In Europe, we have been witnessing joint United\r\nNations actions, in particular with the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation (OSCE) in Europe and with the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\r\nWe would like to note that the structure and\r\ncomposition of regional organizations is changing. The\r\nEuropean Union and NATO are gradually opening to new\r\nmembers. This is a very important phenomenon in the\r\nprocess towards enhancing stability and security in our\r\nregion. Estonia associates its future with full membership\r\nin both of these organizations.\r\nIn conclusion, let me express my sincere hope that on\r\nthe eve of the twenty-first century mankind is willing to\r\nreverse its classical interpretation of the past so eloquently\r\nexpressed at the dawn of this century by the English\r\nnovelist and poet Thomas Hardy:\r\n“War makes rattling good history; but Peace is poor\r\nreading.” [Thomas Hardy, The Dynasts, pt. II, Spirit\r\nSinister]\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and National\r\nSecurity and Attorney-General of Belize, His Excellency\r\nthe Honourable Dean Barrow.\r\nMr. Barrow (Belize): Permit me first to offer you,\r\nSir, the congratulations of Belize’s delegation on your\r\nelection, and the assurance of our fullest cooperation as\r\nyou follow through on the accomplishments of your\r\ndistinguished predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia.\r\nAs the world shifts gears towards a preoccupation\r\nwith what could be described as millennium fever, our\r\nannual stocktaking exercise becomes particularly poignant.\r\nAnd if truth be told, the record of our success —\r\nmeasured against the historical vision of the founders and\r\nagainst current challenges — is not an unsullied one.\r\nNevertheless, in every sphere of human endeavour, in\r\nevery tangible advance of international comity, the\r\nsignature of the United Nations can be found. We have\r\ncontributed to fundamental changes for good in the fabric\r\nof the global community. Of course, and as is always the\r\ncase with less than perfect man-made enterprises, our job\r\nis far from done.\r\nAs the Secretary-General noted in his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization, we live in an era of\r\nrealignment. Belize shares his view that this Organization\r\nhas to continue adjusting to the changes which envelop\r\ntoday’s world, so as to maintain the balance in favour of\r\na more secure and predictable peace, greater economic\r\nwell-being, social justice and environmental sustainability.\r\nDespite sea changes in the international climate, the\r\nrelevance of the original objectives of the Organization’s\r\nCharter remains acute. There is still need to respond\r\nrapidly to threats to international peace and security.\r\nEconomic and social development must be further\r\nadvanced. Human rights, the rule of law and the ideals of\r\ndemocratic, accountable governance must be concretized\r\nin our daily life. And the changes, such as globalization\r\nand reshaping of the United Nations environment must\r\nstrengthen the commitment of nations large and small to\r\ninternational cooperation. The one fundamental lesson that\r\nthe experience of the last 52 years has taught is that we\r\ncannot go it alone. There is large benefit to be derived\r\nfrom multilateralism; and to our mind the United Nations\r\nis the one organization with the wherewithal and capacity\r\nto take global action on a global agenda.\r\nWe have been promised that the renewed United\r\nNations system sought by the Secretary-General will\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nbecome both more effective and more efficient. The\r\nextensive and far-reaching set of changes proposed in his\r\nProgramme for Reform are said to be designed to achieve\r\ngreater unity of purpose, coherence of effort and flexibility\r\nin response. Belize therefore joins with those voices\r\napplauding the attempt to strengthen and streamline the\r\nUnited Nations and enhance its institutional capacity. My\r\ndelegation will eagerly await opportunities to hear comment\r\nand will participate in joint analysis of the proposed\r\nProgramme for Reform.\r\nOne major hindrance to the Organization’s capacity is\r\nits dire financial situation. We have noted proposals within\r\nthe Secretary-General’s Programme for Reform designed to\r\nensure a viable financial basis for the Organization. It is my\r\ndelegation’s view, however, that there is still a need for\r\ngreater clarification if financial solvency is to be assured.\r\nWe are not entirely convinced that the creation of the\r\nproposed Revolving Credit Fund will alleviate the situation.\r\nWe would rather see implementation of measures for\r\nharsher censure in cases of tardiness in meeting obligations.\r\nLet us again state our view that this Organization should be\r\ngranted some measure of autonomy in generating revenue\r\nfrom sources outside national Administrations.\r\nThere is an ongoing parallel at the national and\r\norganizational level aimed at economizing. Streamlining,\r\ndownsizing, or the process of retrenchment by any name,\r\ncarries with it a human cost. We must therefore make every\r\neffort to ensure that the product of reform is greater than\r\nthe sum of its parts. Within this context, we wish to offer\r\nthe caution that in our eagerness to integrate Secretariat\r\nentities and units the critical thrust and focus of various\r\ndepartments, divisions and programmes, should not be lost.\r\nThe gasp of the weak and poor all too frequently can barely\r\nbe heard above the loudly trumpeted agenda of powerful\r\nconstituencies.\r\nDemocracy, human rights and the rule of law have\r\ntaken on renewed paramountcy, particularly in the post-\r\nconflict societies of Latin America. Good governance is the\r\nfoundation upon which we build structures to ensure\r\nsustainable development and durable peace. In both the\r\nsubregions to which Belize belongs this is a principle that\r\nachieves practical as well as intellectual expression. And we\r\nfind this fact noteworthy: that so soon after internal\r\nconflicts convulsed the isthmus, the countries of Central\r\nAmerica have been able democratically and constitutionally\r\nto reinvigorate their societies. It is also remarkable that so\r\nharmoniously has their economic integration movement\r\nadvanced, that they are now prepared to contemplate the\r\nnext step of political union. While this is logical, it is also\r\na quantum leap.\r\nNow, for juridical and historical reasons, Belize can\r\nonly be an observer in this process. But we wish to assure\r\nour Central American brothers that in our heart of hearts\r\nwe too are Morazanistas. We too are uplifted and inspired\r\nby this great visionary. And we sympathize keenly with\r\nthe spirit of the legacy that now animates his modern-day\r\nprogeny.\r\nIn the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) the\r\ncoming of the single market is only the most dramatic\r\nexpression of a new solidarity that Belize enthusiastically\r\nembraces. We continue to draw vital sustenance from\r\nwhat is, after all, a West Indian partnership rooted in a\r\nshared love for, and practice of, democracy, a democracy\r\nthat is not resting on its laurels, but that is engaged now\r\nin a process of revitalization based on the urgent search\r\nfor collective economic security and social advance.\r\nThe proposals for reform encompass suggestions to\r\nachieve greater coordination and cooperation among the\r\nUnited Nations agencies and entities which help nations\r\nlike mine pursue the central priority of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We hope, however, that the effectiveness\r\nand responsiveness of individual agencies will not be\r\ncompromised.\r\nMore will have to be said about seeking innovative\r\nmeans to attract greater capital to finance development.\r\nThe argument that a development dividend can be\r\nrealized by a shift of resources from administration to\r\ndevelopment activities, is not, to our mind, persuasive.\r\nAny possible savings in administrative costs could hardly\r\nbe adequate enough to make significant progress in our\r\ncollective effort to eradicate poverty.\r\nWe have yet to hear any general admission of\r\nsatisfaction with the outcome of the nineteenth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly to review and appraise\r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21 and other agreements\r\nreached at the 1992 United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development. The special session\r\nclearly did not meet expectations for the adoption of clear\r\ntargets, commitments and specific initiatives as we\r\nprogress along the road from Rio. Long-term commitment\r\nand concerted action in the field are still critical if we are\r\nto continue to meet the needs of a rapidly increasing\r\nglobal population without depleting the resource base on\r\nwhich our very subsistence depends.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nWe are heartened that the practical agreements reached\r\nat the so-called Earth Summit + 5 included those of major\r\nconcern to small island developing States, such as climate\r\nchange, tourism and natural disasters. Belize, a country with\r\na low-lying coastal plain, several coral atolls and more than\r\n100 coral islands, experiences challenges similar to those\r\nthat face small island developing States. At the United\r\nNations we participate within the very active Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States, and we remain faithful to the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, adopted at the 1994 Global Conference in Barbados.\r\nWe look forward to the in-depth assessment of the\r\nBarbados Programme to be conducted at the forthcoming\r\ntwo-day special session to be held immediately preceding\r\nthe fifty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly.\r\nBelize will continue to insist that the constituency of\r\nlow-lying coastal States be accorded the deserved support\r\nof the international community so that we too may share in\r\nthe tangible benefits to be accrued.\r\nCountries like mine will also increasingly depend upon\r\nthe United Nations to steer the way forward in building the\r\nnew framework within which developed and developing\r\nnations interact. Against the backdrop of globalization and\r\nmarket liberalization, a new partnership is called for. The\r\nrole of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the regional commissions in\r\nexamining the issues pertinent to globalization and\r\ndevelopment and the effective integration of developing\r\ncountries into the international trading system is especially\r\nkey, for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade\r\nOrganization on the European Union banana regime, which\r\nsecured access for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries,\r\nfully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled\r\nliberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of\r\nsmall, vulnerable and disadvantaged economies.\r\nIn the current climate, it is perhaps basest apostasy to\r\nquestion the new catechism of free trade. “Revisionism” is\r\na bad word, and heresy will no doubt be swiftly repaid by\r\nexcommunication. But has not the zeal of the convert\r\nblinded us to the humanism of the original aims of\r\npreferential access? After all, this was not some hopelessly\r\ncapricious or unreasoning altruism. Preferential access\r\nregimes represented, rather, a real and sincere effort to\r\nenable small developing countries to produce for the\r\ninternational marketplace, to offer their societies a chance\r\nat a decent standard of living and to assure them a special\r\nstake in the global economy.\r\nAlthough economic thinking has changed, the\r\nobjective conditions of poor countries have not. Fervent\r\nrecitation of the new mantra alone can never wipe out the\r\ndiseconomies of scale for small, primary-producing States.\r\nWe cannot now compete on equal terms. Yet our calls go\r\nunheeded for the comprehensive capital inflows and\r\ntechnical assistance so vitally necessary to achieve the\r\nstructural adjustment that will enable us to participate\r\nequitably in the new trading arrangements. I repeat to the\r\nindustrialized world what surely has now become our cri\r\nde coeur: do not cut off our legs, then tell us to run.\r\nDevelopment is still one of the most important\r\naspirations in today’s world. To return to my earlier\r\ncomplaint, the achievement of economic growth and\r\nsustainable development has not been balanced throughout\r\nthe five regions that United Nations comprises. It is an\r\nunderstatement to say that globalization and economic\r\nliberalization have had a different kind of impact on some\r\nof us. A few nations now enjoy the increased well-being,\r\nwhile others are visited only by deepening\r\nmarginalization.\r\nThe recently adopted United Nations Agenda for\r\nDevelopment stresses the role of the Organization in\r\ndevelopment matters. The Agenda is one concrete manner\r\nin which we can collectively address the issues and\r\nproblems relevant to development and, in particular,\r\ndevelopment’s peculiar relationship with peace,\r\ndemocracy, good governance and human rights.\r\nBelize repeats its call for an annual observance by\r\nthe General Assembly at which development policy would\r\nbe the focus of debate. Such encounters could maintain\r\nthe Agenda’s impetus, as well as provide a forum for\r\ndiscussing effective and coordinated follow-through with\r\nregard to commitments made at the several global\r\nconferences.\r\nPreventive diplomacy and peacemaking are still the\r\nbest means at the Organization’s disposal in its efforts at\r\nconflict avoidance. The wide range of activities carried\r\nout in the name of preventive diplomacy must ever be\r\nmindful that success can be guaranteed only with the\r\nconsent of all parties.\r\nBoth the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, in extending existing operations or authorizing\r\nadditional ones, must continue to issue clear mandates. In\r\nthe light of the financial situation, some collective\r\ndiscipline will have to be applied in authorizing mandates\r\nwhen adequate resources are not available.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nOn a related subject, we have learned of efforts under\r\nway to develop the Organization’s rapid-deployment\r\ncapability. This dimension is necessary, but any deployment\r\nin this sense must withstand the scrutiny of national\r\nconsent. Again, we would prefer to see the preventive\r\naspect stressed rather than the enforcement side. Further, a\r\nrapid-reaction capability is not needed solely to respond to\r\nthreats to peace in the traditional sense. Recent measures\r\nemployed to enhance the Organization’s humanitarian\r\nresponse to both man-made and natural disasters are also\r\ndemonstrative of the requirement for the institutionalization\r\nof a rapid-response capability.\r\nIn the Secretary-General’s programme for reform,\r\ndeserved emphasis is placed on strengthening international\r\ncooperation to combat the new threats to civil society. The\r\ndeleterious effects of crime, drugs and terrorism know no\r\nborders.\r\nThe administrative changes to be instituted by the\r\nSecretariat to focus action through the United Nations crime\r\nprevention and criminal justice programme should give us\r\nthe upper hand in waging war against the forces of uncivil\r\nsociety.\r\nCountries such as mine expend huge amounts of\r\nlimited resources in addressing these concerns, which, in a\r\nsmall State, can amount to nothing less than threats to\r\nnational security. Further, we are convinced that the global\r\nnature of the problem requires the highest level of\r\ninternational cooperation that can be achieved. This must\r\nembody the concept of multilateralism and reject unilateral\r\ndevices which disrespect the sovereignty of States.\r\nBelize’s declaration affirming respect for the\r\npersonality, sovereignty and independence of States, which\r\nwas sponsored by 30 members of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS) at the twenty-seventh session of its\r\nGeneral Assembly at Lima, Peru, speaks directly to this\r\nissue and strongly promotes the spirit of partnership that\r\nmust underpin an interdependent approach to addressing the\r\ncommon problem of narcotics trafficking and abuse.\r\nInternational cooperation in this regard must mean the\r\navoidance of not just political, but also of economic,\r\nunilateralism. For example, the banana industry in my\r\ncountry may well be destroyed by the efforts of the very\r\npeople who claim to be our partners in the fight against\r\nillicit drugs. We have a saying in Belize that the same knife\r\nthat sticks the sheep sticks the goat. If the prosperity of\r\nstrategically vulnerable southern Belize is to be sacrificed\r\nnow on the altar of the new orthodoxy, it will not be long\r\nbefore the substitute blandishments of the drug trade\r\nundermine our national anti-narcotics efforts to the point\r\nwhere they too become only burnt offerings at the feet of\r\nthe deity. The immutable, compassionless law of the\r\nmarket is very much a two-edged sword.\r\nIt is in this context that the forthcoming special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on illicit drugs is\r\nespecially timely. It will afford Member States an\r\nopportunity to discuss joint action in preventing money\r\nlaundering, international cooperation in judicial affairs and\r\nlaw enforcement. But the debate must be a thoroughly\r\nholistic one that looks carefully at the interrelatedness of\r\neconomic well-being and effective anti-narcotics policies.\r\nWe commend the prudence of this Assembly in its\r\ndecision that the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\r\nthe Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council should continue\r\ndeliberations during the current session.\r\nIn the absence of any general agreement within the\r\nWorking Group, Belize would find it difficult to accept a\r\nstrict deadline in relation to Council expansion. Further,\r\nwe do not wish to see qualitative distinctions in the\r\ndecision making ability of existing and possible new\r\npermanent members. We note with gratitude that Belize’s\r\ncomprehensive proposals on the subject are still included\r\namong the views being considered.\r\nOn another issue related to reform, the principles of\r\nequitability and universality confer urgency on the claim\r\nfor consideration of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\r\nTwenty-one million people living in a successful, robust\r\nand prosperous democracy should be entitled at the very\r\nleast to a discussion of their circumstances. The blanket\r\n“no”, the annual ritual that continues to slam the door\r\nshut on even the possibility of debating their aspirations,\r\nis irrational and unenlightened. A way must be found to\r\nreview this situation in a manner consistent with the\r\nrights of the parties and the spirit of the Charter.\r\nThis Organization, it appears, is completing a period\r\nof intense self-examination and introspection. We must\r\ncontinue to counter the influences that would ascribe a\r\ndiminished role to multilateralism. Our flexibility and a\r\nvisible search for consensus have enabled us to retool.\r\nWe are demonstrating that we are still equal to the tasks\r\nahead. With reform and renewal moving to the fore this\r\nyear, it is clear that the crisis of confidence is over.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nWith an able chief executive, the United Nations is\r\nnow, therefore, strengthening and repositioning itself to\r\nsurmount the challenges that face us.\r\nIt is our sincere wish that in the weeks ahead we will\r\nreach a new pass in our great undertaking, and that\r\nmomentous debate will result in keen, relevant and timely\r\ndecision-making.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Antigua and Barbuda, His Excellency\r\nMr. Patrick Albert Lewis.\r\nMr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Antigua and Barbuda, I would\r\nlike to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside\r\nover this fifty-second session of the General Assembly. You\r\nare well known to many of the envoys to the United\r\nNations, and we feel confident that under your guidance we\r\nwill have a productive session. I likewise wish to express\r\nmy country’s recognition to the Permanent Representative\r\nof Malaysia, for the manner in which he conducted the\r\nwork of the fifty-first session. I also pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, who is entrusted with the advancement\r\nof this Organization at such a critical time in its history.\r\nOne cannot walk through the edifices of the United\r\nNations without being asked to comment on the reform\r\nprocess and the value of the number of conferences that the\r\nOrganization has staged. The conferences of this decade\r\nhave certainly had an impact on our understanding of\r\ncertain concepts, practices and generationally imparted\r\nbeliefs. Though we have taken many decisions,\r\nimplementation has proved to be difficult, and a\r\nfundamental aspect of the reason or reasons for this is that\r\nthe United Nations needs to be reformed, and Governments\r\nneed to zealously renew their commitments to its existence\r\nand continued advancement.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report is most welcome, and\r\nthere are many points on which my country is in agreement\r\nand others on which we think continued discussion and\r\ndebate are needed. Peace, security and disarmament are\r\nvital to a safe and secure planet, and the countless\r\nindividuals who live daily in constant fear — whether\r\nbecause of terrorists, hatred between ethnic groups,\r\ninternecine warfare or religious persecution — gives us\r\nmuch concern.\r\nThe Organization must have trained and equipped\r\nforces at all times, and the decision of a group of Member\r\nStates to participate in the establishment of a standby high-\r\nreadiness brigade is most encouraging. Additionally, there\r\nis a need for the demobilization of paramilitary groups,\r\nfor demining and for an intensification of peacemaking,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building. Subsequently, the\r\nproblems associated with financing peace operations need\r\nto be addressed in a meaningful manner.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda strongly supports the concept\r\nof results-based budgeting and endorses the proposal to\r\nhave the Secretary-General and the representatives of\r\nMember States enter into a dialogue aimed at shifting the\r\nUnited Nations programme budget from a system of input\r\naccounting to one of results-based accountability.\r\nLikewise, my country welcomes the reforms already put\r\nin place in the Secretariat, through which field operations\r\nhave been considerably expanded, as a result of\r\ncooperation between the Department of Political Affairs,\r\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs and other relevant\r\ndepartments.\r\nWe are anxiously looking forward to June of next\r\nyear, when the diplomatic conference on the need to\r\nestablish an international criminal court will convene.\r\nThis undertaking is long overdue, and Antigua and\r\nBarbuda has been working with neighbouring countries to\r\nthwart the dangers of increased international crime, which\r\nis so active in this hemisphere. Of particular concern is\r\nthe need for greater coordination among nations if the\r\nblight of narcotics is to be meaningfully tackled. Strong\r\nand determined efforts within certain countries will be\r\nseriously undermined if there is not a united global\r\napproach to manifestations and practices which will\r\ndestroy not only the fabric of our societies but the lives\r\nof countless individuals.\r\nThe most talked-about aspect of reform, however, is\r\nthe “Question of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters”. Numerous proposals on the question have been\r\nadvanced, some adding more confusion to the existing\r\ndeliberations. As such, Antigua and Barbuda wishes to\r\nreiterate its declared position that any expansion should\r\ninclude developing countries, and that both the Group of\r\nAfrican States and the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States should be represented.\r\nWe would similarly like to see certain restrictions\r\nplaced on the use of the veto. We understand that all\r\nefforts at restructuring and reform in the United Nations,\r\nhowever, should be focused on economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. In addition, my country is calling for a\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nreversal in the diminishing role of the General Assembly.\r\nThe accountability of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly must be re-emphasized, and the General\r\nAssembly should more actively assert its role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 377 (V) of 3\r\nNovember 1950, entitled “Uniting for peace”.\r\nThe buzzword that we are constantly hearing is\r\n“globalization”. Those of us from small developing\r\ncountries would rather have the emphasis placed on poverty\r\nalleviation, but the present-day reality incorporates the\r\nbelief that the emphasized process of globalization and\r\neconomic integration is unavoidable. There are new\r\ntechniques of production and new forms of organization\r\nwhich have given flexibility to the location of industrial\r\nactivities and have reduced the share of wages in\r\nproduction costs. In many of our democratic societies\r\nthroughout the world, where sacrifices have been made to\r\nreduce unemployment, Governments are faced with the\r\ndaunting and even frightening reality that labour is\r\nbecoming a dispensable commodity. The International\r\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade\r\nOrganization all are promoting the emergence of a global\r\nmarket. The small countries of the Caribbean are forced to\r\nadapt, and our businessmen must accept the reality that the\r\nconcept of protected markets is fast disappearing.\r\nThe multilateral financial institutions which provide\r\nresources to developing countries at concessional rates\r\ncontinue to use the gross national product as a basis for\r\njudging our economic wherewithal. Antigua and Barbuda is\r\ndeemed to be middle-income, but the reality of my\r\ncountry’s various vulnerabilities causes our people and\r\nthose of other Caribbean countries to bow to the flattery\r\nand highlight the unjustness of this means of measurement.\r\nOur sister island of Montserrat has recently had a\r\nseries of severe volcanic eruptions which have caused the\r\ninhabitants much pain and anguish, and Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, along with other Caribbean Community countries,\r\nhas endeavoured to render assistance. As a result, the\r\npopulation of Antigua and Barbuda has increased by some\r\n5 percent, which means that the resources of Government\r\nfor housing, health, education and all other services are\r\nstrained. Our citizens have, however, rendered much\r\nsupport, and Antigua and Barbuda will do all in its power\r\nto help alleviate the plight of our brothers and sisters from\r\nthat lovely but now unsafe island. We strongly support the\r\nrecommendation of the Committee of 24 that the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United\r\nNations Development Programme should move swiftly to\r\nassist in alleviating the plight of the sturdy but\r\nbeleaguered population of the Emerald Isle of the\r\nCaribbean.\r\nThere are other dangerous volcanoes in the\r\nCaribbean, and one is presently forming undersea in the\r\nvicinity of Grenada. In 1974 Antigua and Barbuda\r\nexperienced an earthquake which measured 7.8 on the\r\nRichter scale and which caused considerable destruction.\r\nIn 1995 Hurricane Luis unleashed its fury on our country\r\nfor 48 hours and was declared to have been the worst\r\nstorm of the century. Indeed, a single hurricane can set\r\nback our development some 10 years. Yet the gross\r\nnational product continues to be used to measure our\r\neconomic performance, resulting in the absurd distortion\r\nof Antigua and Barbuda’s being deemed more developed\r\nthan Mexico or Brazil.\r\nWe are pleased to read that at the 1995 Copenhagen\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, the conclusion\r\nwas reached that an economic system has no intrinsic\r\nvalue. It has to be assessed in relation to the betterment\r\nof the human condition. As such, a good economic\r\nsystem should of necessity provide opportunities for\r\nsufficient income to all members of the society; generate\r\nenough resources to enable public institutions to fulfil\r\ntheir responsibilities and promote the common good; and\r\npermit, in addition to the government, participation by\r\ncitizens and other public and private actors in the\r\ndecision-making process. To this end, the Government of\r\nAntigua and Barbuda is presently holding meetings in\r\nvarious forums to discuss precisely the realities of\r\nglobalization and the achievement of a single market\r\nwithin the Caribbean Community.\r\nIn June of this year a special session of the General\r\nAssembly was held on the overall review and appraisal of\r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21. Though there was\r\ndisappointment at the outcome due to the inability of\r\ncountries to coalesce around a common position or\r\ncommon commitments, there was the clear recognition\r\nthat the threat to the global commons remains a profound\r\nreality. There is continued overexploitation and\r\ndegradation of what has been bequeathed to mankind,\r\nwhether in regard to overfishing, overgrazing, excessive\r\ndestruction of forests, or air and water pollution. We have\r\ncollectively failed to capitalize on the promise and\r\naccomplishments of the 1992 Rio Conference.\r\nNine out of ten people in both the developed and\r\ndeveloping world have no idea what the term “sustainable\r\ndevelopment” means and how it affects them. Nine out of\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nten also have little appreciation of why mutual recognition\r\nand mutual action are necessary. People have not been\r\nmade partners in the process of sustainable development,\r\nand Governments should do more to make them so by\r\neducation via the mass media, in the schools, in public\r\ndebate and in public presentations.\r\nThe industrialized countries must take the lead in\r\nchanging their patterns of production and consumption to\r\nsave the global environment and assist developing countries\r\nsuch as mine in our effort to meet our peoples’ basic needs,\r\nto eradicate poverty and achieve economic growth. During\r\nthe special session in June, Caribbean newspapers reported\r\nthat every Caribbean representative zeroed in on the\r\n“poverty issue”.\r\nTo eradicate poverty and achieve economic growth is\r\nnot an easy task and has been further compounded by the\r\nfact that official development assistance, a crucial part of\r\nthe Rio agreements, has fallen from 0.33 per cent in 1992\r\nto 0.27 per cent in 1995. This is well below the agreed and\r\naccepted target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product\r\nof the industrialized countries pledged to development\r\nassistance. The precipitous fall in official development\r\nassistance has shifted the burden for sustainable\r\ndevelopment unfairly to developing countries, destroying in\r\nthe process the equitable balance which was reached at that\r\nvery important Conference. Private capital and foreign\r\ndirect investment, once touted as the panacea for\r\nsustainable development in developing countries, have\r\nshown only selective benefits to some countries and have\r\nbypassed the vast majority. A combination of private capital\r\nflows, foreign direct investment and debt relief as part of an\r\noverall financial package may be a solution.\r\nIn recognizing that an integrated approach to\r\nsustainable development is necessary, since political,\r\neconomic, social and environmental issues are closely\r\ninterlinked and intertwined, we cannot overlook the integral\r\nrole that women can and should play in the quest for\r\nsustainable development. In Rio, women were considered\r\na major group whose involvement was necessary to receive\r\nthe sought-after goals. Mainstreaming women’s concerns\r\nand participation in the planning, implementation and\r\nmonitoring of all development and management of\r\nenvironmental programmes to ensure that women benefit is\r\nnecessary for sustainable development. In this regard, we\r\ncall on the multilateral and bilateral donors to increase their\r\nsupport for women’s organizations in countries such as\r\nmine to enable them to play an active role in all aspects of\r\nthe developmental process.\r\nThere is, however, the fact that we must stress\r\nrepeatedly: the need to reduce the speed of the\r\nglobalization thrust. Dominant Governments and\r\ninstitutions are setting deadlines and establishing agendas\r\nwith such severe demands that most other actors find\r\nthem impossible to follow. The alternative to\r\nparticipation, as it now stands, is marginalization. If all\r\ncountries are required to fully participate, then there is a\r\nclear need for selective linking processes with reference\r\nto both national circumstances and national cultures.\r\nThis brings me to the vexing question of bananas.\r\nThe undoing of the Lomé trade agreement and the injury\r\nwhich this hostile act will inflict on small, banana-\r\nexporting countries of the Organization of Eastern\r\nCaribbean States, of which Antigua and Barbuda is a\r\nmember, is tantamount to an act of war. Small, peace-\r\nloving States, causing no harm to any other State under\r\nthe terms of the Lomé agreement, have found themselves\r\nyoked by the recent World Trade Organization ruling.\r\nWithout some form of protection, the banana industry in\r\nthe States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\nwould collapse, leading to severe social dislocation which\r\nwould ultimately manifest itself in political catastrophe.\r\nBe reminded that on more than one occasion, the\r\nPresident of the United States has cautioned that in this\r\ngalloping global economy, small States cannot be\r\ntrampled upon by their large neighbours.\r\nWhen my country chose to host in May of this year\r\nthe regional seminar of the Committee of 24, better\r\nknown as the Special Committee on Decolonization, it\r\nwas because we knew that the Caribbean has many other\r\nobstacles to overcome in the emerging history of our\r\nregion and the global community. Highlighted at the\r\nmeeting was the principled position of the Special\r\nCommittee that the sustained economic growth and social\r\nadvancement of the Non-Self-Governing Territories is an\r\nessential prerequisite of the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial\r\nCountries and Peoples. Of necessity, particular attention\r\nhas to be given to the environment, natural disaster\r\nmitigation, public health, education, economic self-\r\nsufficiency, the prevention of crime and illicit drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nThe Non-Self-Governing Territories of the Caribbean\r\nhave the same problems as the independent countries in\r\nregard to narcotics. There is a multidimensional thrust\r\nupon our entities, as there is the challenge to\r\ngovernability by non-State actors, the drug operators.\r\nCaribbean countries additionally have to contend with\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nextraterritoriality and other forms of sovereignty challenges\r\nfrom other States, primarily because of conflicting interests\r\nand because the Caribbean States are small and lack\r\nsignificant power.\r\nThe countries of CARICOM are, however,\r\nendeavouring to improve most aspects of their existence,\r\nand new ground in the integration arrangement has been\r\nbroken. Haiti has joined the ranks of CARICOM, a\r\ndevelopment which is considered to be of immense\r\nsignificance, and we wish to applaud the decision to have\r\nthe United Nations Mission in Haiti extended. There has\r\nbeen further movement towards the CARICOM single\r\nmarket and economy. When Protocol II is ratified, the\r\nground will be laid for the free movement of factors of\r\nproduction among countries which have agreed to be bound\r\nby its provisions. A plan is being developed for the\r\nsustainability of both tourist and airline industries in the\r\nregion. Approval was given to a comprehensive human\r\nresource development plan for the specific purpose of\r\nbuilding a more creative and productive workforce in the\r\nCaribbean. Indeed, the countries of CARICOM are\r\nendeavouring to overcome the major legacy of colonialism:\r\nbeing placed on the periphery of the industrialized world.\r\nAs a collective body seeking the betterment of\r\nmankind, the countries which form the United Nations need\r\nto recognize that human advancement requires managing\r\nmarkets as well as liberating them. Clearly, unbridled\r\nmarkets tend to produce a race to the bottom, manifested\r\nthrough a global search for the location with the weakest\r\nregulatory, environmental, social and labour standards.\r\nWhat is required is for rich and poor countries to have a\r\ncommonality of purpose that ensures a path of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Year after year my country pleads for genuine\r\nacceptance of the principle of multilateralism, yet what is\r\nprojected under the banner is of a selective nature projected\r\nby and through the powerful and the dominant. Together\r\nwe must find a way towards a global regime that reduces\r\nemissions of greenhouse gases, accepting the necessity of\r\nwell-off nations to transfer the technology to make this\r\npossible rather than viewing this shift as another\r\nopportunity for private industry to profit.\r\nIt is sad that competitiveness can be pushed in a\r\ndirection which handicaps and retards human development.\r\nState socialism failed, and in the process deprived hundreds\r\nof millions of individuals of both liberty and prosperity.\r\nMarket forces, taken to the extreme, yield poorly distributed\r\nrates of growth, plunder the natural environment and are\r\nmost devastating in regard to the wreckage of humans. The\r\nStates of the developing world are not just emerging\r\nmarkets, they are human societies. Markets must be our\r\nservant, not our master. Clearly, the reality of commerce\r\nis global, but the paths to human development have\r\nhistorically been proven to be local.\r\nIn approaching the twenty-first century, the\r\nGovernment of the twin island States of Antigua and\r\nBarbuda has decided that it should focus on human\r\ncapital and its development rather than focusing narrowly\r\non the economic question. There will be a continuance of\r\nthe policy of carrying out intense investigations and\r\nfeasibility studies to decide where to concentrate limited\r\nresources. In addition, even though the Government is\r\ndivesting itself of some of its holdings and encouraging\r\ngreater private investment in vital services and\r\ncommodities, there are some areas, particularly those\r\nsurrounding technology, in which the Government has to\r\nremain directly involved and catalytic; it will continue\r\nwith its practice of seeking consensus on determining key\r\nindustries and activities crucial and critical for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe will continue to take pride in and to cherish the\r\nUnited Nations, as we recognize its capacity for\r\nachievements in areas beyond the reach of national or\r\nregional authorities. Now the nations which comprise this\r\nbody must redouble their collective commitment for\r\ntranslating vision into reality. That is why it is essential\r\nto have international cooperation for development in the\r\nforefront of our activities. The United Nations is still our\r\ngreatest hope for peace, development and social justice.\r\nThe President: I call now on His Excellency\r\nMr. Ahmed Attaf, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria.\r\nMr. Attaf (Algeria) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nYour election to the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-second session, Sir, gives me the pleasant\r\nopportunity to congratulate you most warmly and to wish\r\nyou all the best for success in carrying out the noble task\r\nentrusted to you.\r\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, who discharged his mandate\r\nwith a skill and effectiveness that earned our respect and\r\nappreciation.\r\nMy praise goes also to Mr. Kofi Annan, who since\r\ntaking up his duties has worked with courage and\r\nselflessness to revitalize the Organization with a view to\r\nbringing it into step with the times and with the\r\naspirations of the peoples it brings together.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nWe are meeting once again at a time when it is being\r\nconfirmed and reconfirmed that the international\r\nOrganization is facing a comprehensive transition involving\r\ntwo fundamental questions: whether mankind is able, first,\r\nto form a concept of the Organization and to put that\r\nconcept into practice, and secondly, to ensure that the\r\nconcept and its implementation enjoy universal participation\r\nrather than being the sole preserve of the dominant Powers.\r\nThe fact is that this transition has both a political and\r\na strategic dimension. Now, soon after the cold war, the\r\nclosure of the East-West rift and the end of the bipolar\r\nsystem, we must find a new pattern of balances in order to\r\nestablish a new, more just and more unified world order, a\r\nworld order that respects the interests and aspirations of all,\r\na world order that quite simply restores the values and\r\nideals on which our Organization was built.\r\nThis transitional phase also has a basic economic\r\ndimension: the challenge of globalization, which must be\r\nfaced by us all in unity so that there will be room for the\r\naspirations of each of us. The test is to master\r\nglobalization, for unbridled globalization would bring new\r\nsetbacks and new exclusions, which would pose a threat to\r\nall.\r\nFinally, this transition has a new dimension: that of\r\ncoping with threats thus far misunderstood or\r\nunderestimated, such as the scourges of international\r\nterrorism, drug trafficking, international organized crime\r\nand environmental degradation. In a related vein, we must\r\nshare the objective of establishing States based on the rule\r\nof law, human rights and good governance as the\r\nfoundation of the new international relations we are\r\nbuilding.\r\nClearly, the United Nations is an active partner in this\r\nglobal transition; hence, it must first of all adapt itself to\r\nongoing changes so that it can influence their development.\r\nThe Secretary-General has in fact taken the good step of\r\nbeginning reflection along these lines, for which we\r\ncommend him, and has taken the initiative to reform the\r\nOrganization.\r\nHere, let me share some of my thoughts on this great\r\nplan for the future.\r\nMy first thought is somewhat methodological in\r\nnature. In the package of reforms submitted we distinctly\r\nsee those which come within the sole purview of the\r\nSecretary-General of our Organization, and he has the right\r\nas well as the duty to implement these reforms. But at the\r\nsame time, it is equally clear that other proposed reforms\r\ncome only within the purview of Member States, which\r\nmust naturally discuss them before taking a decision.\r\nMy second thought gives me the opportunity first of\r\nall to express our satisfaction at the inclusion of new\r\npriorities in United Nations activities — be they in the\r\narea of human rights, humanitarian affairs, the\r\nenvironment, combating terrorism or the crackdown on\r\ndrug trafficking. These are all new universal concerns,\r\nand the United Nations has a central place in dealing with\r\nthem.\r\nHaving said that, the objective of streamlining our\r\nOrganization’s activities should not sacrifice what has\r\nbeen and remains the very reason for being of the United\r\nNations — the two pillars on which it has always rested,\r\nnamely peace and development.\r\nFrom this standpoint, international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, as much as international security and\r\ndisarmament affairs, must not suffer on account of the\r\nrestructuring contemplated. Otherwise, the credibility and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations would be eroded in\r\nthese areas of action, which are destined to remain at the\r\nforefront of the challenges which our countries will have\r\nto face.\r\nMy third thought concerns the financial crisis of our\r\nOrganization. Proposals made by the Secretary-General,\r\nbe it to introduce a new culture of management of\r\nresources or to create a revolving fund, are of some\r\ninterest. However, it is important that Member States be\r\nmotivated, first and foremost, by the obligation they have\r\npursuant to the provisions of the Charter to pay their\r\ncontribution to the budget of the Organization regularly\r\nand fully. This, in effect, is where we find the genuine\r\nand lasting solution to a problem which seems to go on\r\nindefinitely and which should be distinguished and solved\r\nas such, without its serving as justification for depriving\r\nthe United Nations of essential functions which it intends\r\nto undertake in the service of all.\r\nMy fourth thought relates to the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly. If it has become absolutely necessary\r\ntoday to streamline the work of this central body and to\r\nre-examine its programme and work methods, we should,\r\nby the same token, see to it that the Assembly continues\r\nto be the special forum of States where essential issues\r\nconcerning peace, security and development can be\r\ndebated and considered. This is certainly one of the most\r\nappropriate ways to ensure effective participation in the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nmanagement of world affairs, in our quest for solutions to\r\ninternational problems, and to promote genuine\r\ndemocratization of international relations.\r\nIn the era of democracy, transparency and proper\r\nmanagement that we are claiming for our countries, there\r\nis nothing more normal than to insist, together, on the same\r\nvalues and principles in this Organization which unites us.\r\nIt is in this same spirit that we see the problem of the\r\nlegal nature of General Assembly decisions and resolutions,\r\nwhich should be given the necessary effectiveness. It is also\r\nin this spirit that we see the problem of re-balancing the\r\npowers of the Secretary-General and the General Assembly,\r\nwhich should come consistently within the scope of\r\nredefining all the relationships among the principal organs\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nFinally, and this is my last thought, a revision of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter is of crucial importance and\r\nrequires in-depth thought which would raise our\r\nOrganization to a level on par with the vision, principles\r\nand objectives which are inherent in it.\r\nIn this same line of thought, and even if this goes\r\nbeyond the context of reforms proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, I would like to refer to the issue of the expansion\r\nof the Security Council. The Council is, quite obviously,\r\nthe body whose role and responsibilities best reflect the\r\nhopes, expectations and, above all, the frustrations of\r\nStates. Consequently, it is important that the reform tries to\r\nreflect correctly the qualitative and quantitative changes\r\nwhich have taken place in international relations.\r\nThe enhancement of the political and moral authority,\r\nas well as the legitimacy, of this vital body requires a\r\nbalanced representation within it, whether with regard to\r\npermanent or non-permanent seats. Furthermore, any\r\ndecisions regarding its expansion and the revision of its\r\nmethods of deliberation and decision-making would benefit\r\nby having the broadest possible support of Member States.\r\nThe declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Countries in New Delhi in April 1997,\r\nwhich was reaffirmed here in New York, and that of\r\nAfrican heads of State and Government in Harare in June\r\n1997 are, in this regard, valuable contributions for our\r\ncollective thinking regarding the membership and\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council which we all hope will\r\nserve our common expectations.\r\nAmong the new challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity, terrorism is the one which apparently is the\r\nmost formidable because of its threats not only to the\r\nbasic rights of the individual but also to the very\r\ndemocratic foundations of our societies. No State can\r\nconsider itself immune from these threats in the long run.\r\nIn this regard, we should welcome the international\r\ncommunity’s awareness which has taken shape of the real\r\nnature of this phenomenon. This has been accompanied\r\nby greater mobilization of efforts against this scourge,\r\nwhich, above and beyond hindering economic and social\r\ndevelopment of States, engenders the most serious\r\ndangers to international peace and security. In addition,\r\nwe should welcome the decision of the General Assembly\r\nto include the campaign against international terrorism\r\namong the major priorities in its medium-term plan of\r\naction. The present stage requires that we make effective\r\nuse of every achievement by guiding United Nations\r\naction in an innovative and practical direction, based on\r\noperational legal aspects of multilateral activities against\r\nterrorism.\r\nMr. Kamara (Guinea), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nIn the same vein, the conclusion of an international\r\nconvention to suppress acts of terrorism in an integrated,\r\nglobal manner must be one of the major priority areas for\r\nmore effective international action. The international\r\ncommunity must, above all, resolutely respond to the\r\nneeds of the struggle against terrorism, depriving terrorists\r\nof sanctuary and strictly abiding by the relevant\r\ninternational instruments.\r\nIn every sphere, Algeria is continuing to work for\r\nthe emergence and consolidation of mutually beneficial\r\nframeworks for dialogue, solidarity and cooperation and\r\nfor the promotion of relations based on confidence,\r\nmutual respect and common interest. That is what guides\r\nAlgeria in its commitment to building a Maghreb that is\r\nunited, acts in solidarity and is stable and prosperous.\r\nAlgeria, which has made the Maghreb project a national\r\npriority, is resolved to work together with its partners\r\nthere to relaunch the process of building the Maghreb on\r\na solid and durable basis.\r\nTo this end, my country is contributing to the search\r\nfor a just and lasting solution to the question of Western\r\nSahara. Aware of its responsibilities as both a\r\nneighbouring country and an official observer of the\r\nSettlement Plan, Algeria has repeatedly urged the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\ninternational community to shoulder its responsibilities with\r\nregard to the peace process in Western Sahara. The recent\r\nagreement in Houston, resulting from the direct talks\r\nbetween the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO\r\nFront, under the auspices of Mr. James Baker, the Personal\r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, brought a solution to\r\nproblems that had until then prevented implementation of\r\nthe United Nations Settlement Plan. This constitutes major\r\nprogress towards the final settlement of this conflict, and\r\nAlgeria, like the rest of the international community, is\r\ndelighted. Concerned for the stability and security of the\r\nregion, Algeria will continue to make a full contribution to\r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy\r\naimed at the holding of a referendum to enable the people\r\nof Western Sahara freely to exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nIn the Mediterranean almost a quarter of a century ago\r\nmy country distinguished itself through its pioneering role\r\nin highlighting the indivisible link between the two coasts\r\nof our common sea with regard to security and cooperation\r\nmatters. The Helsinki process began at that time. Because\r\nof its dedication to the Barcelona process, Algeria is today\r\ncontinuing to work to establish and consolidate permanent\r\nframeworks for dialogue and cooperation so as to ensure\r\nthat we deal in a satisfactory manner with the political,\r\nsecurity, economic and human concerns of all the States in\r\nthe European-Mediterranean theatre as well as the\r\nlegitimate aspirations of their peoples. We are encouraged\r\nin this regard by the reaffirmation at the Second Euro-\r\nMediterranean Conference, held in Malta on 15 and 16\r\nApril 1997, of the dedication of the Mediterranean countries\r\nto the Barcelona process, which rightly constitutes a major\r\npolitical achievement that should be preserved and promoted.\r\nIn the same context, I am pleased to refer to the\r\nholding of the fourth meeting of Foreign Ministers of the\r\nMediterranean Forum in Algiers on 11 and 12 July. This\r\nprovided the European-Mediterranean theatre with a special\r\nmeeting place for dialogue to foster mutual understanding\r\nand give a new dynamic to the promotion of the European-\r\nMediterranean partnership, at both the multilateral and\r\nbilateral levels.\r\nWithin the Mediterranean theatre, recent developments\r\nin the Middle East are in many respects causing great alarm\r\nand legitimate concerns on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. Prospects for peace that were recently opened\r\nup by the peace process now seem dangerously distant, and\r\nfear of a return to confrontation is increasing every day.\r\nAt the heart of the current impasse are the Israeli\r\nAdministration’s renunciation of the Oslo declaration and\r\nthe Washington agreements; its negation of the principle\r\nof land for peace and its refusal to resume negotiations at\r\nthe point at which they were suspended; and its\r\ncontinuing policy of settlement, including in Al-Quds Al-\r\nSharif, where a programme of systematic judaization is\r\ncontinuing. The Israeli Administration must understand\r\nthat only a lasting peace — that is, a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace — can ensure genuine security for\r\nall the peoples of the region.\r\nThe revitalization of the peace process requires the\r\nIsraeli Administration urgently to end its unilateral\r\nactions, which are contrary to the spirit and letter of the\r\ncommitments that it entered into.\r\nSimilarly, it cannot indefinitely and with impunity go\r\nagainst the will of the international community, which has\r\nset as an absolute requirement for peace withdrawal from\r\nthe Golan and southern Lebanon, as well as the right to\r\nself-determination of the Palestinian people, including\r\ntheir right to an independent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif\r\nas its capital.\r\nAlso in that part of the world the Iraqi people are\r\ncontinuing to suffer unjustly from the effects of a cruel\r\nembargo. My country can only renew its appeal for the\r\nlifting of sanctions, which have lasted for too long and\r\ncannot be justified today. This appeal also applies to the\r\nsituation of the Libyan people, who also continue to be\r\nsubjected to an embargo that is as unjust as it is invalid.\r\nGiven the start of the process of disengagement from\r\nAfrica by the international community, and the dangers of\r\nmarginalization, Africa’s resurgence demonstrates its firm\r\ndetermination to take charge of its destiny and to break\r\nthe cycle of dependence once and for all. This welcome\r\ndevelopment also demonstrates the collective\r\ndetermination of Africa to face the considerable\r\nchallenges that confront it by relying first and foremost\r\non its own resources. In fact, every day Africa gives the\r\nlie to the theory that it is condemned to be a zone without\r\nlaws or development, a zone of insecurity and instability.\r\nThe democracy and pluralism, which are gaining\r\nground every day in Africa and taking firm hold and the\r\neconomic growth at rates that are often spectacular, point\r\nto new development prospects. At the same time, Africa\r\nis showing a promising capacity for conflict management\r\nand resolution.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nThe establishment of the Organization of African\r\nUnity Central Organ’s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution and the Treaty setting up the\r\nAfrican Economic Community are the product of the spirit\r\nof solidarity and mutual assistance which is rooted in\r\nAfrican culture and of a strategy for giving fresh impetus\r\nto intra-African factors of integration and complementarity.\r\nThis is the forum to state that the international community\r\nmust encourage and help these praiseworthy efforts.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the convening of a special\r\nministerial meeting of the Security Council on Africa,\r\nwhich is a major political advance. We venture to hope that\r\nwe are thereby taking steps towards international solidarity\r\nwith the African continent, which will finally be considered\r\nan active partner which cannot be excluded from\r\nhumankind’s great march towards the fulfilment of its\r\ndestiny.\r\nThe signs of recovery which have recently been\r\nevident through the growth of the world economy are a real\r\nsource of satisfaction. However, this slight improvement\r\nneeds to be consolidated so as to make it the lasting trend\r\nof the end of the century.\r\nIn this regard, it is particularly important that the\r\nproblems of development around the world, and particularly\r\nin developing countries, be given priority, since the current\r\ncontribution of developing countries is still well below their\r\npotential and falls short of the role they legitimately want\r\nto play.\r\nThe phenomenon of globalization, which promises so\r\nmuch, instead continues to bring great uncertainty to the\r\ncountries of the South, which is compounded by concern at\r\nseeing many of them further marginalized and even\r\nexcluded from the long-awaited overall development\r\nprocess they so desire. This state of affairs is mainly due to\r\na structure of international relations still marked by the\r\nNorth-South divide. It highlights the continuation of the\r\nbasically adverse nature of an international economic\r\nenvironment characterized by the North’s increasing\r\nmonopoly of the decisive elements of development: trade,\r\nfinancial and stock markets, flows of capital and\r\ninvestment, and technology transfer.\r\nThe countries of the South have made economically\r\nand socially costly adjustments, and carried out bold\r\nreforms in their quest for greater integration into world\r\ntrade, but they still encounter numerous difficulties. These\r\nare aggravated by, inter alia: stifling external indebtedness;\r\na continued deterioration of the terms of trade; an alarming\r\ndecline in official development assistance; and an equally\r\nworrying reduction of international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment in general.\r\nThese disturbing trends are in contrast with the\r\nglobal consensus that has emerged during major\r\ninternational conferences organized over the past decade\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. They raise\r\nlegitimate questions as to the very future of the system\r\nestablished to organize international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOn the eve of the third millennium, and at a time\r\nwhen we are trying to find consensus on the need to\r\nreform our Organization to prepare it to take up\r\nchallenges and face future tasks, we all need to do some\r\nsoul-searching. Tomorrow’s United Nations will be what\r\nwe, the peoples of the United Nations, want it to be. And\r\nthe new United Nations that our countries intend to build\r\nwill, above all, need to be freed from the mistakes and\r\nbad habits of the past.\r\nYesterday, the United Nations was a melting pot for\r\nthe ideals and values that unite us; tomorrow its job is to\r\nreconcile these ideals and values with all the expectations\r\nof our peoples and nations that are still to be met. This\r\nreform project should result in our ideals and values being\r\ndealt with in the only way that matters, namely, turned\r\ninto a vision that become reality. This is what lies at the\r\nheart of this major project which we can undertake for the\r\nUnited Nations and, in the final analysis, for ourselves.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, His Excellency\r\nMr. Somsavat Lengsavad, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)\r\n(spoke in Laotian; interpretation from French text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): In accordance with tradition,\r\nI take this opportunity to begin by congratulating the\r\nPresident most warmly on his assumption of the\r\npresidency of the fifty-second session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. His unanimous election,\r\nwhich has placed him in this highly responsible post in\r\nthis important international arena, is a warm tribute to his\r\ncountry, Ukraine. I wish him every possible success in the\r\ndischarge of his difficult duties.\r\nI would also like to congratulate his predecessor,\r\nMr. Razali Ismail, Permanent Representative of Malaysia,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\non his dynamic presidency during the last session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Lao delegation also wishes to express its\r\nappreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan, our new Secretary-General,\r\nfor his good work so far. His first nine months at the helm\r\nof our Organization have been a time of strenuous effort\r\nand resolute action aimed at reforming our universal\r\nOrganization to make it more effective and better suited to\r\nmeeting today’s challenges. To our new Secretary-General,\r\nwe express our sincere wishes for success in shouldering\r\nhis weighty and great responsibilities.\r\nThe general trend towards dialogue and cooperation\r\nbetween States and peoples for the progress of humankind\r\nin this new era continues to characterize international\r\nrelations. Clearly, we are delighted because on the whole\r\nthis is highly positive. However, in several regions of the\r\nworld we still witness persistent tension and conflict, due\r\nto interference in the internal affairs of States; the\r\nimplementation of policies aimed at hegemony over\r\ndeveloping States; and tribal, ethnic, religious and other\r\ndivisions. This situation of tension and conflict is a\r\npotential threat to peaceful coexistence and harmony\r\nbetween States, and may even jeopardize the current\r\natmosphere of international cooperation to promote\r\ndevelopment. In the interests of world peace, a sine qua\r\nnon for the promotion of socio-economic development, we\r\nshould work together patiently and resolutely, to find\r\nrealistic and appropriate solutions as soon as possible.\r\nIn Europe, the peace accords signed in Dayton on 14\r\nDecember 1995 opened the door to resolving the painful\r\nand destructive conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\r\ntruly hope that the parties concerned will sincerely and\r\nstrictly honour their commitments in order to preserve the\r\nfragile peace and cooperation in that region.\r\nIn some African countries tribal and ethnic conflicts\r\ncontinue to rage, causing serious harm to their peoples. We\r\nexpress our sincere sympathy to the peoples of these\r\ncountries over the untold suffering they have had to endure.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic considers it\r\nimperative that the international community, and in\r\nparticular the countries concerned, redouble efforts to\r\nresolve these disputes as quickly as possible.\r\nIn the Caribbean, multifaceted cooperation between the\r\nStates of the region continues to grow, thus contributing to\r\npeace and security in that part of the world. In this context,\r\nit is time the United States of America made greater efforts\r\nand undertook reasonable negotiations with the Republic of\r\nCuba to resolve their differences, in the interest of both\r\nthe American and the Cuban peoples and in the interest\r\nof regional and global peace.\r\nIn the Middle East, the establishment of the\r\nPalestinian Authority, in accordance with the Washington\r\naccords signed in 1993, marked a crucial stage in the\r\nsearch for a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict, which dates back over 30 years. The\r\npeace process which had been set in motion is now\r\nconfronting grave difficulties, as the recent violence\r\nclearly demonstrates. The Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic expresses its grave concern regarding this\r\nsituation. We very much hope that the parties\r\nconcerned — Israel and the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization — will show great wisdom, and even\r\ngreater restraint, and will engage in serious negotiations\r\nto resolve their problem, thus contributing to restoring\r\npeace and stability to this sensitive region.\r\nIn the Korean peninsula, the implementation by the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United\r\nStates of America of agreements that had been concluded\r\nand the recent opening in New York of preliminary\r\nquadripartite talks on peace in Korea are important stages\r\nin the efforts to ease tension and confrontation in that\r\nregion. In this context, the Lao Government and people,\r\nwhile welcoming the efforts of the parties concerned,\r\nexpress their unswerving support for the legitimate\r\naspirations of the Korean people to live in peace and\r\nachieve the peaceful reunification of the Korean\r\nhomeland.\r\nIn South-East Asia, efforts to strengthen economic,\r\ncultural and other cooperation and improve the settlement\r\nof disputes by peaceful means are clearly priorities.\r\nThe admission of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic and Myanmar as fully fledged members of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on\r\n23 July last was a historic event of great significance. It\r\nis our firm hope that an ASEAN of 10 will become a\r\nreality in the near future and will contribute to\r\nstrengthening our region, and making it more prosperous,\r\nin the interests of peace, stability and cooperation in Asia\r\nand the Pacific, and in the world at large.\r\nAnother problem which has aroused international\r\nconcern is the recent event in Cambodia. Fortunately, the\r\ncurrent Government has been able to restore normality in\r\naccordance with the country’s legislative procedures. The\r\ninternational community, including the Lao People’s\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nDemocratic Republic, continues to recognize and respect\r\nHis Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk as Head of State of\r\nCambodia. It is our hope that all countries and the United\r\nNations will also respect his royal authority.\r\nIn the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, political\r\nstability continues to be solidly guaranteed. The multi-\r\nethnic Lao people are living in solidarity and unity — a\r\nfact which ensures social harmony. In accordance with our\r\nConstitution, the fourth elections for the National Assembly\r\nwill be held in mid-December. That election will once\r\nagain demonstrate the fervent patriotic spirit of the Lao\r\npeople and the development of its democracy towards the\r\nestablishment of a State of law, a State of the people, by\r\nthe people and for the people.\r\nIn the economic sphere, implementation of the renewal\r\npolicy, which began in 1986, has made it possible for our\r\neconomy to experience sustained growth, with an annual\r\nrate for the past five years of approximately 7 per cent.\r\nUnfortunately, this year, my country suffered equally\r\nsizeable losses because of natural disasters and the\r\nrepercussions of financial recession in South-East Asia.\r\nNonetheless, cooperation between Laos and the\r\ninternational community remains very strong.\r\nParallel with its admission to ASEAN, the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic continues to strengthen its\r\nrelations of bilateral cooperation with neighbouring\r\ncountries in the region and in the world on the basis of the\r\nprinciples of equality and mutual interest. In order to ensure\r\nthe sustained development of the national economy, the Lao\r\nGovernment has taken important measures to integrate its\r\neconomy and its market with those of the region and of the\r\nworld. This integration is of great benefit to national and\r\nforeign investors thanks to the country’s economic and\r\nother potential such as its geographical location, in relation\r\nto major regional markets, its transit role, its role as a\r\nsupplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries\r\nand export producer, using the country’s raw materials, and\r\nits innumerable natural tourist attractions.\r\nFollowing up its endeavours and successes of the last\r\n10 years through the implementation of its renewal policy,\r\nthe Lao Government firmly intends to continue its policy of\r\ndeveloping the country on the basis of a market economy\r\nand broadening relations of cooperation with the\r\ninternational community. Its aim is to extricate the country\r\nfrom its state of underdevelopment by the year 2020 and to\r\nestablish a preliminary basis for its gradual transformation\r\ninto an industrialized, modern country under the slogan\r\n“Building a strong and prosperous country, ensuring the\r\nwell-being of the people, forming a civilized and fair\r\nsociety”.\r\nThe world economy is seeing some signs of growth.\r\nNonetheless, this growth falls short of expectations. We\r\nwitness growing inequalities between developing and\r\ndeveloped countries. The international economic\r\nenvironment in terms of access to markets and financial\r\nresources granted on preferential terms for development\r\npurposes is, in general, in decline. Faced with this\r\nsituation, the developed countries must spare no effort to\r\ntake the necessary steps by coordinating their\r\nmacroeconomic policies in order to bring about a\r\nrecovery of the world economy thanks to a stronger\r\nliberalization of trade, which would contribute to\r\nestablishing an international economic environment more\r\nfavourable to development.\r\nThe problem of drug abuse remains a subject of\r\ninternational concern. My country has taken many\r\nnational and international measures with a view to\r\ncontributing to the global effort to eradicate this scourge\r\nfrom the face of the earth. For the first time, in May, the\r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic was unanimously\r\nelected a member of the important Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs by the Economic and Social Council. We\r\nare profoundly grateful to the international community for\r\nthis demonstration of confidence and support and we will\r\nmake every effort to discharge our responsibilities\r\nhonourably.\r\nLast June, after over three years of hard work, the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted, without a vote, An Agenda\r\nfor Development. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nis pleased at its adoption, which it regards as an important\r\nstage in the effort to build a real partnership between the\r\ndeveloped and developing countries. The Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, a highly valuable document, provides a\r\nfoundation of principles, objectives, measures and actions\r\nwhich can serve as a guide to Member States in the\r\nglobal approach to development questions in the\r\nimmediate and long term and at the national and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nThat June, the General Assembly met in special\r\nsession to review the implementation of Agenda 21 five\r\nyears after the Rio Summit on environment and\r\ndevelopment. At the conclusion of that session, a follow-\r\nup programme on the implementation of Agenda 21 was\r\nadopted without a vote; the importance of that\r\nimplementation, inter alia, to the eradication of poverty\r\nin the years to come was stressed. The international\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\ncommunity is therefore called on to exert every effort to\r\nstrengthen cooperation to make this programme a reality.\r\nAs we near the twenty-first century, the United\r\nNations — the only universal multilateral body — has an\r\nimportant role to play in the consideration and management\r\nof international affairs. If it is to be commensurate with that\r\ntask, our Organization must adapt to the new dynamic and\r\ncomplex world. In this context, we express our sincere\r\ngratitude to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\r\nimportant initiatives of his programme of reform, issued last\r\nJuly, which aim at reorganizing our global body in order to\r\nmake it more flexible in its structure and more efficient in\r\nits actions. This very important programme generally tries\r\nto take the interests of Member States into account.\r\nIn considering these questions, it is necessary to\r\nemphasize that any reform process must have the primary\r\ngoal of strengthening the Organization’s capacities to\r\npromote social and economic development for all States,\r\nparticularly the developing among them. At the same time,\r\nthis promotion must be undertaken while addressing\r\nquestions related to peacekeeping, human rights and\r\nhumanitarian activities. It is on the basis of these essential\r\ncriteria that we would wish to see the Organization\r\nreformed and revitalized and given an improved structure,\r\na more democratic regime and a solid financial footing. If\r\nwe do so, the United Nations will be able effectively to\r\nmeet the new challenges of our times.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nWorship of Haiti, His Excellency Mr. Fritz Longchamp.\r\nMr. Longchamp (Haiti) (interpretation from French):\r\nAt the outset, I wish to convey the pleasure of the Haitian\r\ndelegation at faithfully attending this great annual meeting,\r\nwhich always has a particular importance for us. It is yet\r\nanother opportunity to participate in the discussions on the\r\ngreat questions before us and to seek better solutions in our\r\nquest to preserve international peace and security and\r\npromote economic and social progress.\r\nThe consideration of various subjects will certainly\r\nentail difficult debates, but Mr. Udovenko’s long experience\r\nand solid understanding of international problems are sure\r\nguarantees for the successful outcome of our meetings. In\r\ncongratulating him on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session, I wish him\r\nevery success in his guidance of our work.\r\nI take this opportunity to express our gratitude to\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail for the achievements of the\r\nfifty-first session.\r\nTo our new Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, I\r\nconvey our satisfaction at the dynamism with which he\r\nhas infused the Organization since he assumed office.\r\nThree weeks ago, the wreck of a passenger boat,\r\nwhich killed more than 100 of my compatriots, threw the\r\ncountry into grief and the entire world into dismay.\r\nMessages of sympathy arrived from every corner, as did\r\nassistance that helped us to cope with this tragedy. On\r\nbehalf of the Haitian people and Government, I wish to\r\nexpress our deep gratitude to the international community,\r\nwhich, yet again, has demonstrated great solidarity with\r\nmy country.\r\nFor some time, the gist of statements made in this\r\nOrganization about Haiti was a plea for the restoration of\r\na state of law and an end to the violence and brutal\r\nauthoritarianism. Today, I am pleased to convey the\r\nmessage that the Haitian people has been greatly relieved\r\nby the reestablishment of democratic institutions, assisted\r\nby the international community, and the United Nations\r\nin particular.\r\nI wish to highlight some of the progress that has\r\nbeen made in the political sphere and the efforts exerted\r\nto consolidate the gains of the new democratic deal,\r\nwhose rules of play are being increasingly respected. The\r\ntransition of power has been recognized and accepted as\r\na cardinal principle of political life. The state, quasi-state\r\nand civil institutions are being further strengthened.\r\nSocio-professional associations and pressure groups are\r\nplaying an ever more active role.\r\nIn the field of human rights, no effort has been\r\nspared to end the repressive practices that characterized\r\nthe former dictatorial regimes. Arbitrary arrests, summary\r\nexecutions and abuse have practically disappeared. The\r\nstructures of oppression have been dismantled and\r\nreplaced by institutions sensitive to the need to respect\r\ncitizens’ rights. This is the case with the National Police\r\nforce that has replaced the Haitian Armed Forces, which\r\nwere the main perpetrators of human rights violations in\r\nthe country. Created barely two years ago, this Police\r\nforce continues to acquire the experience necessary to\r\ncarry out its responsibilities for keeping the peace and\r\npublic safety. It is already gearing up to ensure security\r\nand stability throughout the country when the mandate of\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nthe United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti ends in late\r\nNovember.\r\nThe judiciary, for its part, has enjoyed special\r\nattention, given the desire for justice expressed by the\r\npopulace. Parliament is currently considering a bill that will\r\nallow the necessary deep-rooted reforms to be undertaken\r\nto improve the administration of justice.\r\nWhile the political situation in the country has\r\nstabilized, economic and social performance has lagged\r\nbehind. The gaps created by the crisis of 1991-1994 have\r\nyet to be breached. Democratic institutions are up and\r\nworking, it is true, but they remain fragile because certain\r\nneeds of the public have yet to be fulfilled.\r\nNonetheless, efforts are being undertaken to revitalize\r\nthe economy. For example, it has been decided to\r\nmodernize public companies. Hence, the creation of the\r\nCouncil to Modernize Public Companies. Cooperation with\r\nParliament has already led to the creation of legal\r\ninstruments aimed at maximizing the potential of these\r\ncompanies to the great profit of users and the consumers of\r\nthe goods and services they produce. Similarly, the fiscal\r\nand financial system is being reformed and trade\r\nliberalized. A bill on customs tariffs is currently under\r\nconsideration by Parliament.\r\nIn order to invigorate national production, an agrarian\r\nreform programme has been launched that aims at\r\nbestowing ownership on the peasants of their means of\r\nproduction. It works on three levels: access to land, access\r\nto credit and availability of technical training. The\r\nGovernment believes that agrarian reform will facilitate the\r\nsocial integration of citizens who have long been\r\nmarginalized.\r\nThis programme falls within an anti-poverty campaign\r\nled by the Government in order to assist the poorest sectors\r\nof society. As can well be imagined, the democratic process\r\nin Haiti is being pursued, but it remains fragile because of\r\nthe precarious situation and the great poverty of the people.\r\nIt is quite obvious that, if it is to be viable, it must be\r\nmaintained, nurtured and supported by sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Heads of State and Government who met here\r\nduring the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUnited Nations two years ago committed themselves to\r\nenabling the Organization to carry out its mandate properly.\r\nConsequently, the Secretary-General is now proposing a\r\nprogramme of reforms to strengthen the role of the\r\nOrganization and to give it a new impetus. We thank the\r\nSecretary-General for this initiative, to which we give our\r\nfull support. This bold and innovative proposal will\r\nenable the Organization to become more effective and\r\ncarry out its mission fully.\r\nSome of the measures presented have drawn our\r\nparticular attention. For example, there is the idea of\r\nregrouping the activities of the United Nations around\r\nfive major themes: peace and security, economic and\r\nsocial development, development cooperation,\r\nhumanitarian affairs and human rights. However, we must\r\nensure that development issues, which are crucial for the\r\nmajority of Members, are given the same attention as\r\nother themes — if not more. Any reform must give\r\ndevelopment the priority, resources and political\r\ncommitment it deserves.\r\nThe question of Security Council reform, which is\r\nstill being studied, is another matter on which we must\r\nmake progress, given the Council’s role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Haiti\r\ncontinues to call for more transparency and participation\r\nin the Council’s work, so that the views of States which\r\nare not members of the Council are considered in the\r\ndecision-making process. Any expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil should be carried out in a way that guarantees a\r\nfair and equal geographical representation. Everything\r\nshould be done so that the universality of the inhabitants\r\nof our planet is recognized in the United Nations system.\r\nHowever timely they may be, reforms alone will not\r\nmake the Organization more efficient if it does not have\r\nadequate financial resources to carry out its activities. We\r\nare convinced that the financial crisis of the United\r\nNations may reduce its capacity to cope with the serious\r\nproblems it faces.\r\nWe need a strong and efficient United Nations,\r\ncapable of finding solutions to current problems and\r\nfacing the challenges of the next century. It is through the\r\norchestrated, collective action of the United Nations that\r\nwe will be able to overcome our numerous current\r\nproblems, which threaten international peace and security\r\nand compromise the well-being of our populations.\r\nThere we refer first to the many armed conflicts\r\nwhich are raging in all regions of the world, some of\r\nwhich seem to resist any attempt at a negotiated\r\nsettlement. Haiti encourages the use of regional and\r\nmultilateral mechanisms to solve these conflicts.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nLikewise, the existence of vast arsenals of weapons of\r\nmass destruction is a grave threat to our collective security.\r\nThe progress achieved in the area of disarmament —\r\nespecially the opening for signature last year of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the entry into\r\nforce of the Chemical Weapons Convention — is\r\nencouraging. However, we urge the countries concerned to\r\nmake further efforts to achieve complete and true\r\ndisarmament.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti welcomes the recent adoption\r\nof the text of a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.\r\nThis is an important step in the battle to eliminate these\r\ndeadly devices, which have caused so much suffering and\r\nwhich continue to take a toll among civilian populations,\r\nespecially among women and children.\r\nThe illicit use of drugs and drug trafficking are also\r\nproblems which the international community must face with\r\ndetermination. They are, in fact, a threat to the internal\r\nsecurity of small States because of the violence and\r\ncriminality with which they are often associated.\r\nFurthermore, drug use affects the most vulnerable stratum\r\nof society: young people. International cooperation is\r\nabsolutely necessary to overcome this scourge.\r\nSince 1960 several summits and conferences devoted\r\nto poverty and development have been organized.\r\nRecommendations have been formulated and measures have\r\nbeen contemplated. Nevertheless, poverty continues to gain\r\nground. According to the 1997 Human Development Report,\r\nmore than 1.5 billion of the planet’s inhabitants live in a\r\nstate of extreme poverty, particularly in African countries\r\nand less developed countries, which see themselves\r\nincreasingly marginalized.\r\nThe eradication of poverty, especially in the least\r\ndeveloped countries, should go beyond simple speeches or\r\nresolutions. It requires a strong political will, adequate\r\nresources, well defined strategies and the implementation of\r\nappropriate programmes. It also requires the sincere support\r\nof the international community, especially the support of\r\ninternational institutions and the leaders of the industrialized\r\ncountries, namely, those who possess technology and\r\nwealth. The battle against poverty must also be a struggle\r\nfor human dignity, sustainable development and peace.\r\nWith a view to strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity, the Republic of Haiti has pursued a policy of good\r\nneighbourliness which has enabled it to come closer to\r\ncountries in the region. It has established with the\r\nDominican Republic a mechanism for consultations through\r\na joint Haitian-Dominican Commission. This is an\r\nexcellent tool for cooperation and working together to\r\nfind a solution to the various problems of the island. We\r\nwould like to see this important forum continue, as it\r\nrepresents a necessary stage towards greater mutual\r\nunderstanding between the Haitian and Dominican\r\npeoples.\r\nLikewise, Haiti recently rejoined the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM). By getting the train of\r\nintegration under way, my country intends to contribute\r\nin a significant manner to the realization of the objectives\r\nof the Community, because Haiti is aware that a strong,\r\nopen-ended, united CARICOM will largely determine the\r\nsocio-economic performance of the Caribbean region. In\r\nthis context, we urge the international community to\r\ncontinue to support the reconstruction of Montserrat.\r\nFifty-two years ago at San Francisco we undertook\r\nto work for the progress and happiness of our peoples in\r\na world where peace and security would reign. We should\r\ntherefore work to realize their dreams and meet their\r\nexpectations and aspirations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe next speaker is the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand Special Envoy of the President of Afghanistan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdullah Abdullah.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Afghanistan): Let me impart at the\r\noutset the sad news I received early today of the aerial\r\nbombardment by the Taliban of the city of Mazar-i-\r\nSharif, the sixteenth consecutive bombardment in just two\r\ndays. These bombardments have taken as many as 150\r\nlives among the civilian population of the city, mostly\r\nwomen and children. I express outrage and condemnation\r\nat this cowardly act of terror, which typifies the Taliban’s\r\ngross violation of international humanitarian law and their\r\nrelentless belligerence against every norm recognized by\r\nthe world today.\r\nI stand before the Assembly and the world\r\ncommunity in the tradition of past Afghan\r\nrepresentatives — with the exception of those during the\r\nyears of occupation — representing an independent,\r\nsovereign and non-aligned Afghanistan.\r\nOne year ago, our Foreign Minister, the late Abdul\r\nRahim Ghafoorzai, stood on this podium to explain the\r\ndark and ominous movement known as the Taliban,\r\nwhich — backed by foreign forces — had invaded\r\nAfghanistan. Tragically, Mr. Ghafoorzai died in the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nservice of his nation. So today it is my duty to stand before\r\nthe Assembly to explain the struggle the Afghan people\r\nhave waged against these mercenaries.\r\nWhen the Taliban entered Kabul on 27 September\r\n1996 their first act was to storm the United Nations\r\ncomplex. The past 12 months have seen a seemingly\r\nendless series of edicts issued by the Taliban in areas of\r\nAfghanistan that they claim to control. Under those edicts,\r\nthey have in fact imprisoned every woman and terrorized\r\nevery man.\r\nTheir latest ignominious act has been to arrest Emma\r\nBonino, the European Union Commissioner for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, her aides and a group of visiting\r\ninternational journalists, including CNN’s Christiane\r\nAmanpour. Outraged by the Taliban’s act, the German\r\nForeign Minister, Mr. Klaus Kinkel, said that he considered\r\nit a slap in the face and an act of “cynical disregard for the\r\nentire European Union”. The group was eventually released,\r\nbut not before at least two of its members were beaten with\r\nthe butt of a Kalashnikov rifle. Ms. Bonino told Reuters\r\nthat the experience had given her a taste of what Afghans\r\ngo through every day under the Taliban.\r\n“This is an example of what people here go\r\nthrough every day: in a situation of random terror.”\r\n[Reuters News Wire, “EC commissioner released by\r\nTaleban,” 29 September 1997]\r\nAn Afghan quoted in The New York Times of 24\r\nSeptember 1997 stated,\r\n“Most days I wake up thinking we’d all be better off\r\ndead than under these fanatics.”\r\nThese are just a couple of facts to open a small window\r\nonto the gloom and despair facing our people.\r\nAs this terror continues in Afghanistan, we are here\r\ntoday to discuss the Afghan question, which is now an\r\ninternational issue.\r\nAs the crisis in Afghanistan continues to unfold, we\r\nmust ask — and answer — important questions, questions\r\nto be answered particularly by those who, under the guise\r\nof neutrality, equate the aggressors with the victims of\r\naggression. Those questions are: Who is following the rules\r\nof the civilized world? Whose actions warrant recognition?\r\nWho deserves to participate in civilized discussion at a\r\nglobal level?\r\nOn the battlefield, we continue, of course, to defend\r\nourselves and our nation. In this imposed war, we are\r\ntaking what we consider to be the moral high ground of\r\nnegotiation and dialogue.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan — like many\r\nothers in the world, including some prominent Pakistani\r\npoliticians and commentators — still identifies Pakistani\r\nintervention and interference in the internal affairs of\r\nAfghanistan as the root cause of the prolonged conflict\r\nand the subsequent suffering of our people.\r\nPakistan constantly alleges that the Taliban control\r\ntwo thirds of Afghanistan, including Kabul, where peace\r\nprevails. Mr. William Maley, the renowned Australian\r\nexpert on Afghanistan, stated earlier in the year that the\r\nTaliban brought peace to Kabul in the same sense that\r\nHitler brought peace to Warsaw.\r\nOn 7 August 1997, Mr. Gohar Ayub Khan, the\r\nForeign Minister of Pakistan, said:\r\n“In Afghanistan ... the majority in the country is\r\nPakhtoons, who are 60 per cent. The other groups,\r\nincluding Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras and Ismailis\r\ncollectively, constitute about 40 per cent.”\r\nThe Pakistani Foreign Minister is blatantly inventing\r\nfraudulent statistics to fuel the flames of ethnic hatred and\r\nconflict in Afghanistan and to justify Pakistani objectives.\r\nNo valid statistics could claim that any ethnic group in\r\nAfghanistan — Pakhtoon, Tajik, Uzbek or other —\r\nconstituted more than 37 per cent of the population. If\r\nPakistan continues its irresponsible policy of perpetrating\r\nethnic hatred in Afghanistan, a consequential escalation of\r\n“ethnic cleansing” will threaten the national unity of our\r\ncountry.\r\nPakistan maintains that it has no favourites in\r\nAfghanistan. The reality is that the Pakistani\r\nestablishment has designated one group of Afghans to be\r\nthe natural rulers over all the rest and conceivably to turn\r\nAfghanistan into a subservient protectorate State.\r\nThe reality was best expressed by Fred Halliday, an\r\ninternational affairs specialist at the London School of\r\nEconomics, who wrote last November:\r\n“The capture by Taliban guerrillas of the\r\nAfghan capital, Kabul, however short- or long-lived,\r\nhas come after two years of one of the most\r\nobnoxious interventions by one State in the affairs of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nanother in many years. Reported in the West as an\r\nindigenous struggle, in fact Pakistan set up the Taliban\r\nas a semi-regular fighting force in 1994 ... providing\r\nthem with ... guns, money, fuel and technical support\r\n... Since its creation in 1947, Pakistan has harboured\r\nthe goal of dominating its northern neighbour.” [The\r\nNation, “Kabul’s Patriarchy with Guns”, 11 November\r\n1996, p. 19]\r\nAnd, finally, the Pakistani Government, by proposing\r\nthe dubious “vacant-seat” formula for Afghanistan, strives\r\nto expel from the United Nations a country that has been a\r\nmember of this global body since before the birth of\r\nPakistan.\r\nMy delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, for having summarized the tragic situation in\r\nAfghanistan in his address to the fifty-second session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 22 September 1997.\r\nAccording to General Assembly resolution 51/195 B,\r\nwhich was adopted unanimously on 17 December 1996, and\r\nfully supported by the Islamic State of Afghanistan, the\r\nAssembly is\r\n“Strongly committed to the sovereignty,\r\nindependence, territorial integrity and national unity of\r\nAfghanistan”. [resolution 51/195 B, seventh\r\npreambular paragraph]\r\nThe General Assembly also stressed\r\n“the importance of non-intervention and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan”.\r\n[ibid., sixteenth preambular paragraph]\r\nUnfortunately, since last year the supply of weapons and\r\nammunition from abroad has massively increased and\r\nconstitutes a very important programme of action by the\r\npowerful Pakistani intelligence service, Inter-Service\r\nIntelligence (ISI).\r\nThe situation has also worsened with regard to what\r\nthe resolution called\r\n“actions undermining the security of State frontiers,\r\nincluding the growing illicit traffic in arms and\r\nnarcotics by criminal elements and groups from\r\n[Taliban occupied] areas of Afghanistan and ... the use\r\nof [occupied] Afghan territory for the training and\r\nharbouring of terrorists”. [ibid., eighteenth preambular\r\nparagraph]\r\nIt is amazing that some of the countries that consider\r\nterrorism a threat to peace should nonetheless — while\r\nclaiming impartiality — favour the rejectionist Taliban by\r\nequating them with the Government of the Islamic State\r\nof Afghanistan, which shares the mounting concerns of\r\nthe General Assembly in this matter.\r\nWith regard to the peace process, we share the view\r\nthat\r\n“the main responsibility for finding a political\r\nsolution to the conflict lies with the Afghan parties”.\r\n[ibid., paragraph 2]\r\nThe Taliban, however, favoured, encouraged and assisted\r\nby the cross-border political and military support,\r\nconsider their only responsibility to be the waging of an\r\naggressive war aimed at conquering the whole of Afghan\r\nterritory by crushing all resistance movements.\r\nThe Taliban’s intransigence and disregard for United\r\nNations General Assembly and Security Council\r\nresolutions calling for a peaceful settlement of the Afghan\r\nproblem are a fact well known to the international\r\ncommunity. The report of the Secretary-General dated 16\r\nMarch 1997 indicates that:\r\n“The Taliban, judging both from their words and\r\nfrom their activities on the ground, appear\r\ndetermined to gain military and political control of\r\nthe whole of Afghanistan and to establish their\r\nvision of an Islamic State”. [A/51/838, paragraph 7]\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report (A/51/929) of\r\n16 June 1997 equally illustrates Taliban’s choice of the\r\nmilitary option and its intention to overrun the country by\r\nforce. This utterly bellicose position of the Taliban, while\r\nprolonging the suffering of the Afghan people is\r\naggravating the concerns of the countries in the region,\r\nwhich views it as a serious threat to the region’s peace\r\nand security. It is worth mentioning that the Taliban’s\r\naggressive attitude is encouraged by military intelligence\r\nservices of neighbouring Pakistan, which still hopes to\r\ninstall a puppet regime in Kabul, subservient to its\r\nexpansionist and hegemonic desires. The dull-minded\r\ninterventionists should read the history of Afghanistan\r\nonce again and learn from the defeat of previous\r\naggressors in this homeland of dauntless and courageous\r\npeople.\r\nWe are fully aware\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\n“that a cessation of armed hostilities ... and political\r\nstability are indispensable if reconstruction measures\r\nare to have a lasting effect”. (Resolution 51/195 A,\r\neighth preambular paragraph)\r\nThe Taliban have expressed no interest in the urgently\r\nneeded reconstruction of the country. In fact, starvation by\r\nblockade is their favourite weapon against Afghans.\r\nWe express our full\r\n“support for the continuing efforts of the United\r\nNations Special Mission to Afghanistan” (Resolution\r\n51/195 B, thirteenth preambular paragraph)\r\nled by Mr. Norbert Holl, and the special assignment on\r\n30 July 1997 of Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi as Special\r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General to assess the situation and\r\nthe role of the United Nations in Afghanistan.\r\nWe reaffirm the full support of our Government for\r\nthe\r\n“activities of the United Nations Special Mission to\r\nAfghanistan, in facilitating ... in cooperation with\r\n[neighbouring and] interested States and international\r\norganizations, the political process towards the goals\r\nof national reconciliation and a lasting political\r\nsettlement with the participation of all parties to the\r\nconflict”. (ibid., paragraph 5)\r\nBecause of the shortage of time, I am omitting some\r\nparagraphs from my prepared text.\r\nThe Taliban have refused to negotiate any political\r\nsettlement and have insisted on a unilateral military\r\nsolution.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan honours\r\n“its commitments regarding the safety and full\r\nfreedom of movement of United Nations personnel, in\r\nparticular the personnel of the United Nations Special\r\nMission, as well as the security of their premises in\r\nAfghanistan.” (ibid., paragraph 7)\r\nRecently, however, as a result of the disturbances\r\nbrought about on 14 September 1997 by Taliban\r\ninfiltration, the premises belonging to international aid\r\nagencies and non-governmental organizations in the city of\r\nMazar-i-Sharif were plundered. This city was previously a\r\nhaven of peace and security. The Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan remains committed to the safety of the\r\nUnited Nations personnel and the personnel of other aid\r\nagencies in Afghanistan.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan, in the light of the\r\nmounting needs of the Afghan people, appeals to all\r\ndonor agencies not to abandon Afghanistan, particularly\r\nin the face of the upcoming harsh winter.\r\nSecurity Council document S/1997/588 of\r\n25 July 1997 explains the Islamic State of Afghanistan’s\r\nagreement to a Declaration of the United National and\r\nIslamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan, the\r\nfoundation for an enlarged body representing all ethnic\r\ngroups from all over Afghanistan. The Declaration\r\naddresses an appeal in favour of the peace process to the\r\nTaliban and the Pakistani Government.\r\nWe favour\r\n“An immediate and durable ceasefire among the\r\nAfghan parties, to be supervised by a commission\r\ncomposed of representatives of all the warring\r\nparties, facilitated by the United Nations”. (ibid.,\r\nparagraph 8)\r\nOne of the most important elements in the General\r\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions on\r\nAfghanistan is the call for\r\n“demilitarization of Kabul, with adequate safeguards\r\nto ensure security and public order”. (ibid.)\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan considers this point to\r\nbe very important. It could constitute a credible precedent\r\nthat could be applied in the future in other parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\nThe\r\n“establishment of a broad-based and fully\r\nrepresentative authoritative council” (ibid.)\r\nas required by the General Assembly resolution, will be\r\nfeasible if the appeal of the United Front inviting the\r\nTaliban to join the Front is heard. The Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan, in this regard, extends its full cooperation to\r\nthe United Nations. It is imperative to secure the\r\nagreement of the Taliban with the United Nations and to\r\nensure its full cooperation with such a broad-based\r\nauthoritative council.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nWe are ready to cooperate for the creation of\r\n“a national security force to provide for security\r\nthroughout the country and oversee the demobilization\r\nof all the warring parties through the collection and\r\nsafeguarding of all heavy weapons in the country, and\r\nto stop the flow of arms and of equipment related to\r\narms production to the parties”. (ibid.)\r\nWe are grateful to the leaders and Governments of the\r\ncentral Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and\r\nTurkmenistan for their respective proposed peace initiatives,\r\nas well as to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Apart from\r\nsupplementing each other, these initiatives may be\r\ncoordinated so as to lead to the convening of useful\r\nnegotiations with a specific agenda under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations. The proposals, however, thus far have\r\nnot been accepted by the Taliban.\r\nThe General Assembly deplored\r\n“the civilian casualties inflicted by the indiscriminate\r\nuse of landmines.” (ibid., paragraph 11)\r\nThe Taliban have recently spread landmines in and around\r\nthe northern city of Kunduz. This is only one example of\r\nTaliban mass use of landmines.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan shares the General\r\nAssembly’s deep concern over and denunciation of\r\n“the discrimination against women and girls and other\r\nrecurring abuses of human rights in Afghanistan ...\r\nemphasizing the importance of democracy and of the\r\nrealization of human rights in any future political\r\nprocess in Afghanistan”. (ibid., ninth preambular\r\nparagraph)\r\nMr. Lloyd Axworthy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\r\nCanada, said in his statement of 25 September in this\r\nAssembly:\r\n“Canadian women, appalled at the treatment of their\r\nsisters in Afghanistan, have started a letter-writing\r\ncampaign. I will be delivering some 5,000 letters\r\ntoday to the Secretary-General, which call on him to\r\ntake the lead in exposing the gross human rights\r\nviolations of women in Afghanistan as unacceptable in\r\nthe eyes of the world’s citizens.” [See Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fifty-second\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 12th meeting]\r\nWe draw the attention of the General Assembly to\r\nthe recent document (A/52/384) containing the\r\nDeclaration of Principles made by the United Islamic and\r\nNational Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan, adopted\r\non 20 September 1997 by the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan. The Declaration, systematizing a political\r\nframework for the country, contains the following\r\nprinciples: first, the principle of Islam; secondly, the\r\nprinciple of independence and international cooperation;\r\nthirdly, the principles of democracy and pluralism;\r\nfourthly, the principles of election and delegation of\r\nauthority to local administration; and, fifthly, the principle\r\nof human rights.\r\nThe General Assembly last year called on\r\n“all States strictly to refrain from any outside\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,\r\nincluding the involvement of foreign military\r\npersonnel”. (Resolution 51/195 B, paragraph 15)\r\nRegarding the involvement of Pakistani military personnel\r\nin Afghanistan, the Government of the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan has transmitted amply documented\r\ninformation to the United Nations.\r\nThe book, entitled The Not-So-Hidden Hand —\r\nproduced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the\r\nIslamic State of Afghanistan — has been distributed to\r\nthe members of the Security Council, some other\r\ninterested countries and the Secretariat of the United\r\nNations. This book — I will not go through it; it is a big\r\nbook — documents directly and proves the physical\r\npresence of Pakistani paramilitary and military personnel\r\ninside Afghanistan, fighting alongside the Taliban against\r\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan.\r\nThe book includes, first, identification photos of\r\neach Pakistani captive, prisoner registration forms with\r\ndetailed descriptions, fingerprints and other data\r\npertaining to each; secondly, identification cards taken\r\nfrom some prisoners that illustrate their membership in\r\nextremist Pakistani organizations responsible for terrorist\r\nacts in South Asia, such as Anjuman-i-Sipah-e-Sahaba\r\nPakistan; and thirdly, correspondence from most of the\r\nprisoners to their families in Pakistan, written mostly in\r\nUrdu — the official Pakistani language, which is not\r\nspoken in Afghanistan.\r\nI should like to remind the Assembly that on 3 July\r\n1997 Mr. Francis Okelo, the Deputy Head of the United\r\nNations Special Mission to Afghanistan, together with a\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nUnited Nations military adviser, paid a visit to Maimana\r\nprison in northern Afghanistan and verified the physical\r\npresence of Pakistani military prisoners in the prison. And\r\nThe News of 6 September 1997 — printed in Islamabad —\r\ncontains an article entitled “Pakistanis in Masood’s captivity\r\nplead for release”.\r\nThe General Assembly called upon all States\r\nimmediately to end the supply of arms, ammunition,\r\nmilitary equipment, training or any other military support\r\nto all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan. Furthermore,\r\ndocument A/52/403, dated 29 September 1997, confirms the\r\nrecent dispatch of some 600 additional military personnel\r\nand that shipments of arms from Pakistan to Afghanistan\r\nhave significantly increased.\r\nThe General Assembly has reiterated that the\r\ncontinuation of the conflict in Afghanistan provides a fertile\r\nground for terrorism and drug trafficking, which destabilize\r\nthe region and beyond. The United Nations Information\r\nService reported on 11 September 1997 a rise in opium-\r\npoppy production in Afghanistan to 2,800 metric tons in\r\n1997, an estimated 25 per cent increase over 1996.\r\nMr. Derek Fatchett, a Minister in Britain’s Foreign Office,\r\npointed out in The Guardian of 25 June 1997 that the\r\nTaliban war chest is financed by drug money. Furthermore,\r\n96.4 per cent of Afghanistan’s total opium production\r\noriginates in provinces currently under Taliban control,\r\naccording to the United Nations Information Service report.\r\nAfghanistan, as a State party to the Convention for the\r\nProtection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage of\r\n23 November 1972, has recognized its primary duty to\r\nensure the identification, protection, conservation,\r\npreservation and transmission to future generations of, inter\r\nalia, the cultural heritage situated in the country. The\r\nGeneral Assembly has called upon all Afghan parties to\r\ntake appropriate steps to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary,\r\nput a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation\r\nof and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural\r\nproperty of the Afghan nation. The Taliban, however, on 17\r\nApril 1997, out of fanaticism expressed its intention to\r\ndemolish the two largest statues of Buddha in the world. In\r\nspite of great concern by the Secretary-General and\r\nMr. Federico Mayor, Director of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), and many Buddhist leaders throughout the\r\nworld, the Taliban did not exhibit any change of attitude.\r\nFortunately, its military push was repulsed and the colossal\r\nstatues remain intact.\r\nIn this context, reference should be made to the\r\nancient artifacts plundered from the rich Kabul National\r\nMuseum. According to Pakistani press reports, the\r\nartifacts have been added to the personal collections of\r\nthe former Pakistani Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, and\r\nthe former Minister of the Interior, Nasirullah Babar. On\r\nbehalf of the people of Afghanistan, I call upon the\r\nPakistanis to return these irreplaceable Afghan artifacts,\r\nwhich are also part of the world’s cultural heritage. I urge\r\nUNESCO to investigate the matter.\r\nI should like to announce that the delegation of the\r\nIslamic State of Afghanistan, together with some other\r\ncountries of the third world, will co-sponsor the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Towards a culture of peace,”\r\nsubmitted under agenda item 156. My delegation also\r\nsupports the resolution of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil adopted in Geneva entitled “Proclamation of the\r\nYear 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of\r\nPeace”.\r\nWe want to establish the best fraternal relations with\r\nPakistan and other neighbouring countries. Afghanistan’s\r\npivotal location places it, as always, at the crossroads of\r\ndifferent corners of Asia. Naturally, no regional economic\r\ncooperation — in the context of the transit of goods,\r\npetroleum and natural gas — can succeed without a\r\npeaceful Afghanistan enjoying administrative unity.\r\nAfghanistan must cease to exist as a country of\r\nconfrontation, discord and clashes. Rather, it must turn\r\ninto a land of interrelation, association, joint action and\r\ncooperation. This is the genuine desire of all patriotic\r\nAfghans and of the true friends of Afghanistan.\r\nFifty-two years ago, the United Nations was founded\r\non the paramount ideals of a safer world and on\r\nparameters of global peace and collective security. The\r\nForeign Minister of Italy, His Excellency Mr. Lamberto\r\nDini, said in his speech last week before the General\r\nAssembly:\r\n“We no longer live in a world of purely\r\nnational interests. More and more, policy-making is\r\ninformed by global concerns such as human rights,\r\nsolidarity and social justice. At the threshold of the\r\ntwenty-first century, let us pledge to settle religious\r\nand ethnic conflicts through dialogue, tolerance and\r\ncultural exchange, and to find collective answers to\r\ninternational terrorism, organized crime, drug\r\ntrafficking and the degradation of the environment.”\r\n[See Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nFifty-second Session, Plenary Meetings, 11th meeting]\r\nLet me from this rostrum remind all of us here, as the\r\ngeneral debate draws to a close, that we must ask ourselves\r\nabout the level of our commitment to the implementation of\r\nthe ideals I have mentioned.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI call on Mr. Pierre Osho, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Benin.\r\nMr. Osho (Benin) (interpretation from French): As I\r\ntake the floor on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of\r\nBenin, I would like first to associate myself with the words\r\nof congratulations and deep appreciation expressed to Mr.\r\nHennadiy Udovenko by previous speakers. They spoke so\r\neloquently that I will confine myself to saying how hopeful\r\nI am that this session will benefit from his proven\r\ncompetence and his remarkable analytical mind in order to\r\ndraw from our debates constructive conclusions that\r\npreserve a just balance between the different suggestions\r\nand recommendations contained in the various statements.\r\nThe particular significance and nature of this session\r\ndo not reside only in the impressive gathering of leaders\r\nfrom 185 Member States. That has long been customary,\r\nand has even become ritual, during this period every year\r\nsince the establishment of the United Nations in 1945.\r\nWhat confers on this fifty-second session a distinctive\r\ncharacter, and what promises it an excellent place in the\r\nannals of the United Nations, is the central focus of its\r\nagenda, which, as we all know, is devoted to structural\r\nreform.\r\nWhat is our assessment of the specific reform\r\nprovisions that are to be discussed and decided upon in the\r\ncourse of these meetings? What are the ins and outs of\r\nreform, the issues at stake and the real objectives? Are the\r\nreforms capable of giving the Organization the means for\r\nproductive and effective action to meet the complex\r\nproblems and numerous challenges on the horizon of the\r\nnext millennium, whose effects are already strongly felt in\r\nthe everyday realities of today’s world?\r\nThese are a few of the major concerns of countries,\r\nsuch as mine, that are today experiencing both hope and\r\ndoubt: hope based on the enormous potential of our Earth,\r\nwhose intelligent, rational and well-directed use should\r\nmake it possible to ensure the progress, prosperity and\r\ndevelopment to which all peoples legitimately aspire; but\r\nalso doubt, a feeling of stubborn and profound uncertainty\r\nconstantly fuelled by misery and poverty, ignorance and\r\ndisease, technological lags, and the economic\r\nbackwardness that over 1.5 billion human beings suffer\r\nfrom.\r\nSince his election in January 1997 our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, has resolutely tackled, with\r\ncommendable diligence, strength and motivation, the\r\npreparation of a programme for reform, which he himself\r\nrightly describes as\r\n“the most extensive and far-reaching reforms in the\r\nfifty-two year history of this Organization.”\r\n(A/51/950, Letter of Transmittal, first paragraph)\r\nIt is reform aimed at giving the United Nations\r\n“the ways in which the United Nations can more\r\neffectively and efficiently meet the challenges that\r\nlie ahead as we enter a new century, and a new\r\nmillennium”. (ibid.)\r\nWe regard as appropriate the global approach taken\r\nby the Secretary-General, his view of general and sectoral\r\nproblems, the thrust of the measures and solutions he\r\nadvocates, in accordance with a methodology that\r\ncombines pragmatism and the need for democratic and\r\nmore effective functioning. Therefore, the delegation of\r\nBenin is in favour of the bulk of the proposals in the\r\nreport.\r\nNonetheless, I must draw attention to the following\r\nconsiderations to which my country attaches great\r\nimportance.\r\nFirst, Benin believes that it would not be appropriate\r\nto eliminate the Committee for Development Planning,\r\nwhich is, inter alia, entrusted with developing the\r\nperformance criteria for the least developed countries. We\r\nbelieve that rather than having it replaced by groups of\r\nexperts created by the Economic and Social Council we\r\nshould consider purely and simply retaining the\r\nCommittee.\r\nSecondly, since the situation in Africa is one of the\r\npriorities on which the Secretary-General would like to\r\nfocus in the next five years. My country would hope that\r\nthe Office of the Special Coordinator for Africa and Least\r\nDeveloped Countries might be strengthened in terms of\r\nhuman and financial resources in order to be better able\r\nto play a full role within the United Nations system.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nThirdly, although on 20 June 1997, following over\r\nthree years of negotiations, the General Assembly adopted\r\nthe Agenda for Development, it is regrettable that the\r\nSecretary-General’s reform programme made no mention or\r\nexplicit reference to mechanisms and means for\r\nimplementation and assessment of the Agenda. My\r\ndelegation hopes that this question will be taken into\r\naccount in the framework of measures envisaged in order\r\nto bring about the renewal of the Organization.\r\nLastly, I would like to anticipate the results of our\r\nsession by saying that, both individually and collectively,\r\nwe must firmly commit ourselves to implement the\r\ndecisions and measures that will be taken in the framework\r\nof this long-awaited reform.\r\nOur consensus will be not a triumph for the ideas of\r\none State or group of States over another, but, rather, the\r\nfruitful result of a shared political resolve to adapt our\r\nuniversal Organization to the changes and developments of\r\nthis end of the century period.\r\nHere, and with specific reference to reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, Benin strongly recommends that the\r\nfollowing principles should be taken into account: an\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council truly\r\nreflecting the political and economic configuration of\r\ntoday’s world; equitable geographical representation of the\r\nfive regional groups, with the African group entitled to four\r\nseats, two permanent and two non-permanent; and\r\nprotection of democratic and transparent functioning,\r\nultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto.\r\nBy formulating the 15 priority objectives of his reform\r\nprogramme as a series of profound changes of major scope\r\nwhich should enable the United Nations to embark\r\nresolutely on a course of radical reform, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral produced a document of undeniably high quality,\r\nwhose title — “Renewing the United Nations” — is\r\nsignificant in more than one respect.\r\nGiven the noble and legitimate aspirations of the entire\r\ninternational community for the future of the planet, the\r\nOrganization certainly needs to be renewed in order to\r\nconfront effectively and successfully the exciting yet\r\ndisturbing challenges posed by globalization. Renewing the\r\nUnited Nations requires a new vision of the world, new\r\nconceptions and approaches to partnership among nations,\r\nand new methods for the Organization and for handling\r\nrelations among States in a new world. That is the real\r\nproblem. Those are the real stakes at a time when we are\r\ninexorably approaching a new millennium. Globalization is\r\nboth a phenomenon and a process; it has become the\r\nrecurrent and omnipresent theme of all debates and of all\r\nconcerns.\r\nLike other members, I noted with particular interest\r\nthat President Clinton — first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel\r\non the evening of 21 September, then the following day\r\nin this Hall — forcefully and germanely stressed the need\r\nfor the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of\r\nthe economy does not create deep disparities between rich\r\nand poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships\r\nbetween the private sector, non-governmental\r\norganizations and international financial institutions.\r\nAs the representative of a least developed country,\r\nBenin, I cannot but welcome this great and noble idea,\r\nimbued with generosity, pragmatism and a spirit of\r\nsolidarity. But, looking the facts in the face, what do we\r\nsee?\r\nWhen on 18 December 1991 the General Assembly\r\nadopted the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, it created a new\r\npolitical covenant, one of whose vital features was the\r\nprinciple of shared responsibility and the international\r\ncommunity’s full and complete involvement with Africa\r\nwith a view to achieving development objectives\r\nincluding a real growth rate of at least 6 per cent per\r\nannum in gross domestic product, and a minimum net\r\ntotal of $30 billion in official development assistance for\r\n1992, with an annual increase averaging 4 per cent\r\nbeginning in 1993.\r\nToday, six years after the adoption of the New\r\nAgenda, in spite of all the efforts of African countries to\r\nmake better use of official development assistance, and in\r\nspite of the express intention of a number of developed\r\ncountries to support the development of Africa, the total\r\nvolume of official development assistance to Africa has\r\ndeclined considerably: by about one third compared with\r\nthe forecast of $30 billion.\r\nIt was in this context of the decline in official\r\ndevelopment assistance that the famous United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa was launched in\r\nMarch 1996 in order to lend fresh momentum to the New\r\nAgenda. But it is obvious that this great initiative can be\r\nsuccessful only with the support of the international\r\ncommunity, through a massive mobilization of financial\r\nresources to carry out the programmes and projects that\r\nhave been set up. While, to be sure, it is first and\r\nforemost up to the African countries to make the greater\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\npart of the effort, the excessively restrictive procedures and\r\nconditionalities for the granting of loans, and the lukewarm\r\nreaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling\r\nthe foreign debt of poor countries, are obstacles to the\r\neffective mobilization of the expected financial resources.\r\nIn a publication issued at Washington just a few\r\nmonths ago, in May 1997, the International Monetary Fund\r\ndefined globalization as\r\n“the growing economic interdependence of the entire\r\nworld caused by an increase in the volume and variety\r\nof transborder transactions in goods and services, and\r\nin international capital flows, along with the rapid and\r\nbroad dissemination of modern technology”.\r\nWelcomed by some, feared by others, globalization\r\nhas become an unavoidable economic reality for all nations.\r\nFor most experts and other analysts, this process marks the\r\nsuccess of the global spread of an economic liberalization\r\nthat began in Europe half a century ago with the Marshall\r\nPlan. In their view, it brings unprecedented possibilities to\r\nbillions of people all over the world.\r\nFor us in Africa, that optimistic vision needs to be\r\ntempered, for possibilities are not realities. So that it can\r\nbecome a reality, the harmonious pursuit of the\r\nglobalization process, in the context of real development for\r\nall those billions of people throughout the world, especially\r\nin Africa, necessarily presupposes a new international\r\nprogramme of solidarity and cooperation for the poor\r\ncountries, without which globalization will very soon\r\ntransform their regions into a poor and marginalized\r\nperiphery of a hyper-rich and hyper-developed world.\r\nIn fact, the developed countries are already doing a\r\ngreat deal for Africa, if we consider the sum total of the\r\nloans made to the continent through bilateral and\r\nmultilateral assistance. And yet, contrary to what statistics,\r\ncurves, graphs and growth rates would have us believe,\r\nAfrican populations have not yet felt any tangible\r\nimprovement of their standard of living in their daily lives.\r\nIn spite of all this, for the immense majority of Africans\r\nthe will to survive is stronger than despair, and hope\r\nprevails over resignation.\r\nThe ministerial meeting of the Security Council\r\ndevoted to Africa, held on the commendable initiative of\r\nthe United States last 25 September, led to a fruitful\r\nexchange of views that showed us a real will on the part of\r\nthe international community to become more actively, more\r\nsignificantly and more concretely involved in a new type of\r\npartnership with Africa in order to contribute to its\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe signs of this real readiness on the part of the\r\ndeveloped countries have proliferated in recent years, as\r\nwe can see, inter alia, from the resolutions of the G-7\r\nadopted in Lyon and in Denver, assistance programmes of\r\nthe eighth European Development Fund, President\r\nClinton’s initiative for a partnership for economic growth\r\nand opportunity and the Tokyo International Conference\r\non African Development (TICAD I), and so on.\r\nAll in all, it can be said that the will exists to help\r\nAfrica emerge from poverty and underdevelopment, that\r\nconcrete actions are being undertaken in this direction and\r\nthat new commitments are being made. Nevertheless,\r\nthere still remain, unfortunately, enormous problems, and\r\nAfrica continues to present to the world the desolate\r\nspectacle of endemic poverty, aggravated by crises and\r\nfratricidal conflicts.\r\nIn order to put an end to this distressing situation,\r\nAfrica’s development partners should envisage a\r\ncomprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible,\r\noperational and effective financing, free of bureaucratic\r\nimpediments and red tape, with the aim of establishing a\r\ncentralized funding entity to receive resources from all\r\nsources to be devoted to economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe end of the cold war, the process of economic\r\nglobalization and the progressive realization of the\r\nconcept of sustainable development offer the opportunity\r\nfor profound change, calling into question some of the\r\ntraditional solutions and conventional answers to\r\ndevelopment problems.\r\nIn the dark centuries of the slave trade, Africa\r\ncontributed blood, sweat and the toil of its strongest arms\r\nto the building of the bases of the economy of the New\r\nWorld. The collective memory of humankind must not\r\nforget this important historical fact. Today the developed\r\ncountries have the moral duty to be as concerned as\r\nAfricans themselves about the destiny of Africa, not to\r\nabandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to\r\nmake available to it part of their enormous material,\r\ntechnological and financial strength, in order to support\r\nAfrica’s efforts in the struggle to emerge from\r\nunderdevelopment and to enter the modern age.\r\nIn order that the implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nthe 1990s (UN-NADAF), the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, Agenda 21 and other\r\nprogrammes of action can be truly successful, it will be\r\nnecessary to establish a global system of operations and\r\nfinancing for Africa, like the Marshall Plan, which\r\ncontributed greatly to the reconstruction and economic and\r\nsocial recovery of Europe after the Second World War. The\r\nestablishment of this mechanism before the year 2000 will\r\nmake it possible for Africa to stride confidently, not slouch,\r\ninto the twenty-first century.\r\nShortly before the statement that was made on 5 June\r\n1947 at Harvard University by General George Marshall to\r\ndefine the foundations of his well-known European\r\nRecovery Programme, President Harry Truman stated:\r\n“Our duty is to help free peoples to fashion their own\r\ndestiny in their own way. I believe that our assistance\r\nmust be first of all economic and financial, because\r\nthis is essential to economic stability and political\r\norder.”\r\nFifty years later, this magnificent and noble spirit of\r\nsolidarity, displayed voluntarily by the great American\r\npeople and its Government, still retains all its validity and\r\nall its historical meaning.\r\nThere are cases in which, because of the requirements\r\nof its own unfolding, history repeats itself. Here at the end\r\nof a century, we are experiencing one such case: it is\r\nnecessary to meet the urgent need for a new Marshall Plan\r\nfor Africa. And the upcoming second Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development (TICAD II) could\r\nprovide one of the best opportunities to do so.\r\nIf the international community works resolutely in this\r\ndirection, we will have laid the solid and indestructible\r\nfoundations for a road on which we will all be able to\r\nmarch triumphantly into the third millennium.\r\nFor its part the Government of Benin, while awaiting\r\nthe fulfilment of that hope, has developed the concept of a\r\nshared social minimum level in order methodically and\r\neffectively to take actions and measures aimed at\r\neliminating poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy,\r\nproviding adequate housing, guaranteeing productive\r\nemployment, improving standards and conditions of living\r\nand ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources. This\r\nconcept was the subject of an international symposium,\r\nsupported by the United Nations system, which was held in\r\nCotonou from 4 to 6 August 1997.\r\nThe consolidation of our process of democratic\r\nrenewal, which began after the historic National\r\nConference of the Active Forces of the Nation in\r\nFebruary 1990, necessitates immediate and short-term\r\nsocial and economic successes. That is why we are\r\nendeavouring, with our limited resources, to take\r\nmultifaceted actions to improve the living and working\r\nconditions of our rural and urban populations. However,\r\nwe know that we can rely on international cooperation,\r\nfounded not only on solidarity, but on mutual interest and\r\npartnership, to overcome the difficulties confronting us, to\r\nsupport our efforts at economic and social recovery, to\r\nbuild a State genuinely based on the rule of law and to\r\nconstruct a free, democratic, modern and prosperous\r\nnation.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI shall now call on the representative of Canada, who\r\nwishes to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nI remind members that statements in exercise of the\r\nright of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second\r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Duval (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nI should like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo for his statement\r\nthis morning, and especially for his favourable reference\r\nto the Ottawa process and the global efforts to prevent the\r\nproduction and use of anti-personnel landmines. However,\r\nI should like to clarify one issue with regard to the\r\nMinister’s statement that some members of the Security\r\nCouncil refused to support the idea of a temporary\r\nmultinational force, led by Canada, in response to the\r\nhumanitarian crisis raging in what was then called eastern\r\nZaire. It is important to recall that the mandate of the\r\nmultinational force in question was adopted unanimously\r\nby the Security Council as resolution 1080 (1996) on 15\r\nNovember 1996.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI call on the representative of Pakistan, who wishes to\r\nspeak on a point of order.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 1 October 1997\r\nMr. Islam (Pakistan): The gentleman styling himself\r\nas the representative of Afghanistan made a number of\r\nobjectionable references about Pakistan in his statement this\r\nafternoon. My delegation would like to reserve the right of\r\nreply, and will exercise it at a later stage.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
