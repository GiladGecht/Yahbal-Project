(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Qatar, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin\r\nJassem bin Jabr Al-Thani.\r\nSheikh Al-Thani (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsecond session. I am confident that your political\r\nexperience will help you conduct the work of the session\r\nwisely and successfully.\r\nI should also like to commend your predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the\r\nexcellent way in which he presided over the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session.\r\nI also wish to extend our congratulations to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to his\r\ncurrent position, and to express our appreciation for his\r\nprogramme for the reform of the Organization. He can be\r\nassured of our full support for any measures he takes to\r\nthat end.\r\nAs we approach a new millennium, the world is\r\nwitnessing a series of internal and external conflicts that\r\nrepresent a great regression when compared to the\r\noptimistic expectations that followed the end of the cold\r\nwar and the collapse of ideological conflicts. A new\r\nworld characterized by balance and equitable relations\r\namong States was expected to emerge, with a view to the\r\ncreation of innovative cooperation among our States and\r\npeoples in different areas of concern. However, I regret\r\nto say that the world is still facing severe problems, such\r\nas political conflict, poverty, famine and intensive\r\nmigratory movements. These are the result of poor\r\neconomic conditions, refugee flows caused by wars, the\r\ndeterioration of the environment, trafficking in illicit\r\ndrugs and the proliferation of organized crime.\r\nIn the context of these changes, and more than half\r\na century after the United Nations was established, there\r\nis an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drastic\r\nreforms, both structural and functional, so as to establish\r\nrules and principles for a new international order free of\r\ndouble standards. Such a new order would allow us to\r\nrise to the new challenges and achieve the goals set forth\r\nin the Charter more than 50 years ago for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and the\r\nintensification of international cooperation for the benefit\r\nof the peoples of the world.\r\nTo this end, the process of reform must begin by\r\nactivating the role of the General Assembly and enabling\r\nit to fulfil its duty in an effective manner that would give\r\nits democratic resolutions vitality and credibility before\r\ninternational public opinion. The Security Council must\r\nalso be reformed, so that it can carry out the role it has\r\nbeen entrusted with, because it has a special status among\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nthe United Nations bodies, as defined in the Charter. In our\r\nview, this cannot be achieved except through a general\r\nagreement that would regulate the use of the veto power,\r\nlimiting such use to cases covered by Chapter VII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, namely, threats to international\r\npeace.\r\nIn order for the Security Council to reflect the new\r\npolitical and economic realities of a changing world, it must\r\nincrease the number of its non-permanent members to\r\nprovide for just and balanced representation and to enable\r\nthe Council to deal with the new international realities and\r\nshoulder its responsibilities by becoming more democratic\r\nthrough the adoption of a rotation system, not limiting\r\nmembership to certain States, and by giving all States the\r\nopportunity to participate in its work and assume their share\r\nof international responsibility.\r\nAlthough we understand the opinions advocating an\r\nincrease in the number of permanent members, we believe\r\nthat the coexistence of permanent members that have the\r\npower of veto with permanent members that do not, plus\r\nnon-permanent members, runs counter to the concepts of\r\nequality among States, geographic and cultural\r\nrepresentation and international participation. It also runs\r\ncounter to the principle of democratic decision-making. In\r\norder to achieve the required balance, fairness, justice,\r\nequality and reason call for an increase in Security Council\r\nmembership for Asia, Africa and Latin America. Together,\r\nthose three continents have the majority of world population\r\nand States. Nevertheless, their representation on the\r\nSecurity Council is less than 50 per cent. In order for the\r\nSecretary-General to be able to carry out the reforms that\r\nfall within his competence, the financial crisis of the United\r\nNations must be addressed by making Member States\r\nhonour their legal commitments and pay their dues without\r\ndelay. In this regard, we would like to express our deep\r\ngratitude to Mr. Ted Turner for his generous donation to\r\nsome United Nations humanitarian programmes. We hope\r\nthis will be an encouraging initiative for others to follow.\r\nThe task of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity has particular importance. Therefore, measures\r\nrecommended by the General Assembly or taken by the\r\nSecurity Council should not be limited to post-conflict or\r\nwar situations. More attention should be given to\r\nappropriate and timely preventive measures, because we\r\nbelieve that early measures adopted by the international\r\ncommunity are the ideal way to avert the outbreak of\r\nconflicts and wars and to avoid taking the necessary\r\npolitical and military measures in the aftermath of the\r\nconflict — let alone imposing half solutions that are often\r\nunfair.\r\nThe question of disarmament plays an essential role\r\nin building the foundation of international peace and\r\nsecurity. To achieve this goal, we believe that renewing\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) indefinitely is a decision that requires more support\r\nand endorsement, so that the Treaty can acquire a\r\nuniversal character, with the adherence of all States. In\r\nthis context, the State of Qatar affirms that Israel should\r\nadhere to that Treaty and should place its nuclear\r\nfacilities under the International Atomic Energy Agency’s\r\nsafeguards regime. This will be a basic step towards\r\nestablishing a zone free from nuclear and other weapons\r\nof mass destruction in the Middle East. It would also\r\ncontribute to achieving equitable and balanced peace and\r\nstability in that important area of the world so that there\r\nwould be no multiple criteria for defining the conduct of\r\nStates.\r\nIn the same context, we cannot fail to mention the\r\nspecial importance of the Convention to ban anti-\r\npersonnel mines, which was finalized in Oslo recently. It\r\nwill be ready for signature in Ottawa next December. We\r\nhope it will be signed by all States.\r\nThe world has witnessed fundamental economic\r\nchanges, such as the end of State control of economic life\r\nin many States, the withering away of numerous restraints\r\non international trade, the easy transfer of capital and\r\nhuge investments across the world. Meanwhile, many\r\neconomies in developing countries are still deteriorating.\r\nThis requires that urgent and effective solutions be\r\nprovided by the international community to enable those\r\nStates to progress and develop their societies through\r\nbuilding strong and effective economies. Such an\r\nendeavour requires us to take a new look at expenditures\r\non armaments, in order to save such huge sums and\r\nallocate them to supporting education and health\r\nprogrammes. This would also enable us to address the\r\nproblems of poverty and the environment and to develop\r\nthe economies of developing nations. This is an absolute\r\nnecessity for any new international economic order based\r\non integration and balance, and is capable of devising\r\ndesired solutions for the aforementioned problems. The\r\nproblems of poverty, backwardness and lack of access to\r\neducation and medical care are among the problems that\r\naffect developing countries. The societies of such States\r\nalso suffer from a population explosion that is\r\ndisproportionate to their resources. At the same time,\r\nfortunes are being wasted on armaments, arms races or\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nluxuries. This causes huge discrepancies in consumption\r\nrates between the peoples of rich countries and those of\r\npoor countries.\r\nSuch problems compel us to be fully aware of the fact\r\nthat solving them requires reconsidering the question of\r\nmilitary expenditures. It is no secret to anybody in authority\r\nthat while the programmes implemented by the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the World Food Programme cost less than\r\n$4.6 billion a year, Governments all over the world are\r\nspending about $800 billion every year on armaments,\r\nwhile 1.3 billion people are still living in a state of abject\r\npoverty.\r\nNow I would like to address the situation in the\r\nMiddle East and the crisis of the peace process.\r\nThe Israeli Government is still stalling in the\r\nimplementation of agreements and putting impediments and\r\nobstacles in the way of achieving a just and comprehensive\r\npeace. Israel is undermining the peace process by building\r\nsettlements, reneging on agreements and commitments\r\nreached with the Palestinian Authority, imposing a blockade\r\non the Palestinian people, depriving them of their rights and\r\nflouting international legality. This generates violence and\r\ncounter-violence. The Israeli policy runs counter to General\r\nAssembly resolutions and Security Council resolutions,\r\nespecially resolutions 242 (1967), 271 (1969), 298 (1971),\r\n478 (1980) and 672 (1990). They all provide that all\r\nlegislative and administrative measures taken by Israel\r\naimed at altering the legal status and demographic\r\ncomposition of the occupied Arab territories, including the\r\ncity of Jerusalem, are null and void, and have no legal\r\nrelevance. They also run counter to the Fourth Geneva\r\nConvention of 1949 concerning the protection of civilians\r\nand their properties in time of war. Therefore, the\r\ninternational community is called upon to exert pressure on\r\nthe Israeli Government to make it desist immediately from\r\nimplementing the policies that jeopardize the peace process\r\nas a whole.\r\nThe Arab leaders affirmed last year at the Cairo\r\nsummit that peace in the Middle East is a strategic option.\r\nThey underlined the importance of having all the parties\r\ncommitted to the Madrid formula that calls for a peace\r\nbased on the principle of land for peace. This means that\r\nIsrael should withdraw completely from all the occupied\r\nPalestinian and Arab territories, including East Jerusalem,\r\nto enable the Palestinian people to establish their\r\nindependent State, with Arab Jerusalem as its capital. It\r\nshould also withdraw completely from the Syrian Golan and\r\nfrom southern Lebanon to the internationally recognized\r\nborders, in keeping with Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nThere has been a noticeable improvement over the\r\nlast five years on the road to achieving a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. It started with\r\nthe Madrid Conference and moved on to Oslo and the\r\nsubsequent peace accords. Several economic conferences\r\nwere held to promote the Middle East peace process and\r\nto contribute to moving it forward by underscoring the\r\ncommon interests of the peoples of the region.\r\nTo that effect, arrangements are being made to hold\r\na fourth economic summit conference for the Middle East\r\nand North Africa next November in Doha, the capital of\r\nmy country. In this connection, I would emphasize that\r\nthe State of Qatar has no private interest in acting as host\r\nfor this conference. Our interest in holding it is based on\r\nthe following reasons.\r\nFirst, we believe that peace is a strategic choice that\r\nthe Arab countries have adopted since the Madrid\r\nConference.\r\nSecondly, such a conference would manifest our\r\ndesire for the peace process to continue. Failure of the\r\npeace process would have serious implications and would\r\nthreaten peace both at the regional and at the international\r\nlevel.\r\nThirdly, our region has witnessed many wars in past\r\nyears, the last of which was the 1991 Gulf War, which\r\nhave impeded economic and political progress in our\r\nregion and imposed on us huge expenditures on\r\narmaments at the expense of the social development and\r\nwell-being of our peoples.\r\nFourthly, at the 1995 Amman Economic Summit the\r\nState of Qatar committed itself to acting as host to the\r\nfourth summit conference, and honouring that\r\ncommitment is a question of our credibility as a State that\r\nrespects its commitments.\r\nSome are of the opinion that the conference should\r\nbe cancelled due to current Israeli policy that does not\r\nrespect undertakings and agreements, flouts international\r\nlegality and tries to marginalize the role of the United\r\nNations. Although we in Qatar understand the reasons\r\nbehind such an opinion, which calls for the cancellation\r\nof the conference in response to the practices of the\r\nIsraeli Government, which has not respected its\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\ninternational commitments, we do respect our international\r\ncommitments, and we believe that no State should have\r\nveto power with regard to the peace process. We have\r\ntherefore decided to act as host to the conference on its\r\nappointed date. If it does not prove to be successful and\r\nfails to achieve the desired results, the Government of Israel\r\nwill bear sole responsibility.\r\nThe State of Qatar welcomes the position of the\r\nUnited States of America, as expressed by its Secretary of\r\nState during our meeting in Saudi Arabia and here in New\r\nYork. We also welcome the resolve it has shown in dealing\r\nwith the disruption of the peace process in the Middle East,\r\nas well as the fact that it has underlined the principle of\r\nland for peace, the relevant resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil and the inadmissibility of taking unilateral\r\nmeasures that run counter to the peace process.\r\nMy country also appreciates the position of the States\r\nof the European Union, as well as the Russian Federation\r\nfor their support of the peace process in the Middle East.\r\nThe State of Qatar views with satisfaction and\r\nappreciation the positions taken by States that support the\r\nMiddle East peace process and reject the Israeli settlement\r\npolicies that are obstructing that process. At the same time,\r\nmy country stresses the importance of the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the Middle East peace process and\r\nopposes any attempts to exclude it.\r\nThe State of Qatar joins the other fraternal members\r\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council in their endeavour to\r\npromote security and stability in the Gulf region, which is\r\nof strategic and vital importance to the entire world. The\r\nState of Qatar is making a constructive effort in that\r\ncontext with the aim of establishing good and constructive\r\nrelations with all countries of the region on the basis of\r\ngood-neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-intervention in\r\nthe internal affairs of others, respect for international\r\nlegality and the settlement of disputes through peaceful\r\nmeans, dialogue and mediation or by arbitration under\r\ninternational law. The State of Qatar supports the settlement\r\nof the dispute between the United Arab Emirates and the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran over the three islands of Abu\r\nMusa and Greater and Lesser Tunb by those means.\r\nMy Government and people have expressed their\r\nfraternal feelings and strong empathy towards the brotherly\r\npeople of Iraq, who are living in extremely difficult\r\ncircumstances resulting from the sanctions imposed on\r\nthem. We have therefore welcomed the oil-for-food\r\nagreement between the United Nations and Iraq to alleviate\r\nthe suffering of the fraternal people of Iraq and to provide\r\nthem with such basic necessities as food and medicine.\r\nMy Government has also emphasized the importance of\r\nrespecting Iraq’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nregional security. We condemn any foreign interference\r\nin its internal affairs. In the same context, my\r\nGovernment affirms the importance of implementation by\r\nthe Government of Iraq of the relevant resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council, in particular those concerning the\r\nrelease of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees and other\r\nnationals in the same conditions. Such steps would help\r\nthe international community to lift the embargo imposed\r\non Iraq and would also enable Iraq to carry out a\r\nconstructive role in achieving security, stability and\r\nrehabilitation in the region.\r\nMy Government also expresses its concern for the\r\nsuffering to which the brotherly people of Libya are being\r\nsubjected due to the sanctions imposed against that\r\ncountry because of the Lockerbie issue. In that\r\nconnection, the State of Qatar calls for the creation of a\r\nuniform and agreed regime for imposing sanctions and of\r\nmechanisms to lift them subsequently in a manner that\r\ndoes not distinguish among States and peoples and that\r\nstrikes a balance between international interests, on the\r\none hand, and the suffering to which peoples are\r\nsubjected, on the other.\r\nLast week the Security Council devoted a meeting to\r\naddressing the problems of disputes and wars in some\r\nAfrican countries. It considered ways of containing and\r\nsolving such problems. The State of Qatar, which has\r\nfraternal relations with the African countries, is pained to\r\nwitness the current state of affairs in States such as the\r\nSudan, Somalia, the Comoros, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and\r\nthe Congo. We believe that the African States are capable\r\nof overcoming their plight if they receive the necessary\r\ninternational support, particularly for the purpose of\r\nimproving their economies and the transfer of technology\r\nin an international partnership in which all would\r\nparticipate.\r\nMy country was one of the first to welcome the\r\nDayton Peace Agreement because we believe in the\r\nimportance of peace and cooperation in the Balkans. We\r\nhave therefore supported the reconstruction of the\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have also made\r\ncontacts with our neighbour countries to urge them to\r\ncooperate with each other to help rehabilitate the region,\r\ndevelop its resources, link it to the international economy\r\nand improve the situation of its peoples.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to point out that in order\r\nto solve the problems the world is facing it is imperative\r\nfor us to work together for the benefit of mankind.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Edison James, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for External Affairs, Legal\r\nAffairs, Labour and Immigration of the Commonwealth\r\nof Dominica\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for External\r\nAffairs, Legal Affairs, Labour and Immigration of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica.\r\nThe Honourable Edison James, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for External Affairs, Legal Affairs, Labour\r\nand Immigration of the Commonwealth of Dominica,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming the\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for External Affairs, Legal\r\nAffairs, Labour and Immigration of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica, His Excellency The Honourable Edison James,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. James (Dominica): I recall two years ago, when,\r\non the occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the founding of the United Nations, this podium was the\r\nfocus of attention. There was much enthusiasm and hope as\r\nleaders looked back on the past 50 years and looked\r\nforward to the next 50 and the coming of the new\r\nmillennium. I had the honour to be among world leaders\r\nwho shared the privilege of participating in that historic\r\noccasion. It was then that we as leaders made a number of\r\npledges and committed ourselves to effecting necessary and\r\nappropriate changes to reshape and reform the United\r\nNations. We pledged never to repeat the mistakes of the\r\npast and to work for a better world through an improved\r\nand more dynamic United Nations.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the\r\nfifty-second session and to thank Ambassador Razali Ismail\r\nfor his work in guiding the fifty-first session. It is with\r\nprofound pleasure and a sincere sense of hope and\r\nexpectation that I welcome and congratulate our new\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. I assure him that he\r\nhas the full confidence and support of the Commonwealth\r\nof Dominica in his endeavours.\r\nNotwithstanding the leadership changes, if we are to\r\nachieve our ultimate goal of a better world for all, much\r\nmore must happen. The reform of the United Nations,\r\nwhich has been the subject of such intense debate for so\r\nlong now, must become a reality. We have noted and\r\ntaken seriously your commitment, Mr. President, to\r\nencourage action-oriented discussions on measures and\r\nproposals that encompass the reform of the United\r\nNations system. It is our wish that the discussion, as vital\r\na part of the process as it is, will be as short-lived as\r\npossible and that the implementation of reforms which we\r\nall want to see will very soon be effected.\r\nThe people of this world are demanding reform. The\r\nOrganization itself needs the reform. Let us do it now.\r\nThe numbers, geographic representation and decision-\r\nmaking process of the principal organs of the United\r\nNations must urgently reflect the realities of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nMembership in the United Nations is based on the\r\nsovereign equality of its Members. Whether we are small\r\nor whether we are big, we are worthy of respect. And we\r\nall have an obligation to work towards maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security; achieving international\r\ncooperation in solving economic, social, cultural or\r\nhumanitarian problems; and encouraging respect for\r\nhuman rights and for fundamental freedoms.\r\nWe do not expect to be in an Organization where the\r\nrule is the law of the jungle; that is, the survival of the\r\nfittest. Rules and regulations of any organization which\r\ncan be interpreted and implemented in a manner which\r\nthreatens the survival and the very existence of its\r\nmembers are undesirable.\r\nMost of us are members of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO), and I wish to bring it to the\r\nattention of the General Assembly and of all\r\nrepresentatives that recent decisions taken in the WTO at\r\nthe request of some Members of this very United Nations\r\nare threatening to destroy the livelihood of smaller\r\nnations. The Commonwealth of Dominica, my country,\r\nand other countries of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) are threatened by this action. Our main\r\nmeans of livelihood — bananas — has been placed on the\r\nshakiest of grounds by this decision. Such uncertainty\r\nbrings about instability and can threaten peace.\r\nWhile the General Assembly has no enforcement\r\nauthority, its resolutions and recommendations to Member\r\nStates carry the political and moral force of majority\r\napproval. I appeal then to Member States to use whatever\r\nis in their power to persuade the complainants against the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nEuropean banana marketing regime to consider the\r\nconsequences of their action and to think again.\r\nCliches like “desperate times call for desperate\r\nmeasures” and “a hungry man is an angry man” may sound\r\nbanal, but they cannot be ignored. Peace in our region and\r\npeace in the world depend much on the humanitarian\r\ndispensation of justice. The action which has been taken\r\nagainst us in the WTO is not justice.\r\nThe raison d’être for the establishment of the United\r\nNations was to maintain peace and security. You,\r\nMr. President, in your address to this body recognized that\r\npeace and security are threatened by international terrorism.\r\nMay I draw to your attention that peace and security can\r\nalso be threatened by economic terrorism. Our region is\r\nnow threatened by economic terrorism, and our\r\nOrganization — the United Nations — has a responsibility\r\nand a duty to ensure that no form of terrorism succeeds in\r\nundermining our peace and security.\r\nThis matter is so serious that I urge the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to pay a visit to the now tranquil and peaceful\r\nCaribbean region, starting in the Windward Islands, to get\r\na sense of the situation for himself. For there is a flame\r\nignited in that area which has the potential to transform\r\nitself into a conflagration of a magnitude capable of\r\nengulfing the entire hemisphere.\r\nIn May of this year in Bridgetown, Barbados,\r\nCARICOM and the United States entered into a Partnership\r\nfor Prosperity and Security in the Caribbean. Our ability to\r\nmeet our obligations for implementation of the Plan of\r\nAction will be seriously compromised by this decision of\r\nthe WTO which seeks to deny us the opportunity to earn\r\nour living.\r\nOur Caribbean region is often described as paradise,\r\nbut sometimes there can be trouble in paradise. Our region\r\nis prone to natural disasters. Hurricanes, earthquakes and\r\nfloods are not uncommon, and the world knows of the slow\r\ndestruction of the island of Montserrat by the volcanic\r\neruptions which have been going on now for over two\r\nyears. Member States of CARICOM have come to the help\r\nof this small territory, however there continues to be a great\r\nneed for humanitarian assistance, and we look to the\r\nMembers of the United Nations for their meaningful\r\ncontribution to rebuilding the Emerald Isle.\r\nMan-made threats also plague our region, one such\r\nbeing the trans-shipment of hazardous waste through the\r\nCaribbean Sea. The indiscriminate pollution of the sea, the\r\ndestruction of marine life by the discharge of waste into\r\nthe waterway by ocean liners, and the trans-shipment of\r\nillegal drugs and arms all pose serious threats to the\r\norderly development of the region. There is a need to\r\nestablish a regime under the auspices of the United\r\nNations to stem such practices.\r\nWe cannot help but lament that after 50 years and\r\nmore our world has not yet found that peace for which\r\nthis body was instituted. In the past years we have seen\r\nthe struggles in the former Yugoslavia and in Central\r\nAfrica. We have witnessed the scourge of ethnic\r\ncleansing and killings. And the Middle East remains\r\nunsettled. Unrest in any part of the world affects us all.\r\nIt is therefore our responsibility to work towards that total\r\npeace.\r\nWe congratulate the 100 nations which have signed\r\nthe Treaty banning the production and dissemination of\r\nlandmines. Such weapons of destruction do not deserve to\r\nexist in a civilized world. We trust that nations which are\r\nstill hesitating will soon come around and sign — and\r\neventually ratify — the Treaty.\r\nFor there to be peace we must acknowledge the right\r\nof peoples and nations to exist, regardless of colour, class,\r\nrace, creed, political belief or model of government. This\r\ndecade was declared the International Decade of the\r\nWorld’s Indigenous People. We are happy to report that\r\nin the Commonwealth of Dominica the first peoples of\r\nthe Caribbean, the Caribs, coexist peacefully with the rest\r\nof the population. It is our intention to work diligently\r\nwith the Secretary-General so that before this decade is\r\nover there will be some tangible and positive impact on\r\nthe lives of our own indigenous people which would give\r\nmeaning to the noble intentions of this body in making\r\nthis declaration.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica as a member of\r\nCARICOM, the Organization of American States (OAS)\r\nand the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), is\r\nheartened by the spread of democracy throughout the\r\nhemisphere. We intend to play our part to ensure that this\r\nmovement is not transient, but, rather, reflects a deep-\r\nrooted conviction of our people that this is indispensable\r\nfor development and prosperity.\r\nWe respect the right of all countries to chose their\r\nown model of government, while at the same time we\r\nurge all Members of the Organization to practice or\r\ncontinue to practice the democratic process and to provide\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nfor their people full opportunity to enjoy all the benefits of\r\na democratic society.\r\nIt is against this background that the Government and\r\npeople of the Commonwealth of Dominica call again on\r\nthis world body not to continually close its ears to the pleas\r\nof the Republic of China for international recognition. It\r\nmust be remembered that the Republic of China is a\r\nfounding Member of this Organization and has been a\r\nMember for the greater part of its existence. The Republic\r\nof China on Taiwan is a politically democratic and\r\neconomically dynamic society with a directly elected\r\nGovernment and Parliament. Dominica therefore urges\r\nMember States not to continue to ignore or block the\r\nefforts being made to admit the Republic of China to\r\nmembership of this and other international bodies.\r\nPeace in this world also requires that the hungry be\r\nfed, the homeless sheltered, the ignorant educated, all\r\npeople enjoy good health, and our patrimony — the\r\nEarth — kept in a condition that we all can enjoy. We\r\napplaud and encourage the efforts of international\r\norganizations — including United Nations specialized\r\nagencies, which work to satisfy these needs and aspirations.\r\nThe effective functioning of this Organization requires\r\nproper management of its resources, both human and\r\nfinancial. We encourage the Secretary-General in his efforts\r\nin this regard, and we call upon all members to do their\r\nbest to provide the necessary financial support to the limits\r\nof their ability. I take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nMr. Ted Turner on his generous donation to the\r\nOrganization and, like him, call upon others to do likewise.\r\nI am convinced that the Secretary-General will use this gift\r\nmost wisely and judiciously, knowing that proper utilization\r\nof these funds will dispose others to come forward.\r\nEvery country, even the most developed ones, has its\r\nneeds. We in Dominica, a developing country, have many.\r\nGlobalization and trade liberalization, combined with the\r\nimpact of natural disasters, have increased the urgency for\r\ndiversifying our economy. In this regard, attention is being\r\npaid to our human resource capacity, to take advantage of\r\nthe revolution in technology and communication.\r\nA major thrust in the process of diversification is\r\ntourism, but tourism with a difference: ecotourism. Earlier\r\nI mentioned the need to preserve and conserve the Earth for\r\nthe enjoyment of all. My country Dominica has much to\r\noffer to visitors who want to enjoy nature, and we are\r\nworking hard to make ourselves the ecotourism destination\r\nof the Caribbean. Some of those listening to me may have\r\nvisited Dominica and know how difficult it is to enter\r\nthere. We are taking steps to make it easier to visit my\r\ncountry by the construction of a 24-hour landing facility\r\nfor long-range aircraft. We trust that our approach to\r\nfriendly nations and institutions for assistance in this\r\nregard will receive favourable consideration.\r\nThe beginning of the new millennium is close at\r\nhand. Two years ago we all pledged to redouble our\r\nefforts to work towards fulfilling the obligations we\r\nassumed when we became Members of this great\r\nOrganization. Let none of us waver in our resolve. The\r\nkey to it all lies in our working together as Members of\r\nthe United Nations. Let us join hands and wills to build\r\nthis better world. History will judge us harshly if we do\r\nnot.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nExternal Affairs, Legal Affairs, Labour and Immigration\r\nof the Commonwealth of Dominica for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Edison James, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nExternal Affairs, Legal Affairs, Labour and\r\nImmigration of the Commonwealth of Dominica, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Ivan Antonovich, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBelarus.\r\nMr. Antonovich (Belarus): It gives me particular\r\npleasure to congratulate you, Sir, the distinguished\r\nrepresentative of Ukraine, on your election to the\r\nresponsible post of President of the fifty-second of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I am convinced\r\nthat your rich and profound experience in diplomatic\r\nrelations, together with your personal qualities, will\r\nfacilitate the constructive work of this General Assembly\r\nsession and make it an outstanding international event.\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Belarus is ready to\r\ncontribute to your endeavours in any way required. I\r\nwould also like to use this opportunity to say a word of\r\ngratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for his\r\ncompetent and efficient presidency during the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nEvery day, international life and international\r\nrelations acquire ever more multidimensional and ever\r\ndeeper significance, with new meanings and trends in\r\ndevelopment that can no longer be constrained within the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\ncriteria and standards of the twentieth century. We live at\r\na time oriented towards the future. A fin de siècle mentality\r\nis not just a nostalgic feeling for the century passing away,\r\nbut also embraces a deep concern for the years ahead. The\r\ndestiny of mankind, however contradictory and diverse, and\r\nthe interests of nations and States may become more\r\namenable to one common denominator, are increasingly\r\nconcerned with the well-being of humanity, and display\r\nnumerous convergent features which make it possible now\r\nto discuss the opportunity for a new international order.\r\nEntering the twenty-first century, with its new\r\ninternational order, does not mean that we renounce the\r\nexperience of the last 52 years in the development of the\r\nfamily of nations under one common programme, as set out\r\nfor us by the founding fathers of the United Nations and\r\noutlined in its Charter. On the contrary, it means adjusting\r\nthese lofty aims to the new realities of a multifaceted world\r\nand also making the Organization — no matter how\r\ndifferent its separate parts are — the mainstream of human\r\ndevelopment, where the economic well-being of people\r\nbrings to an end age-old ills such as starvation and\r\nepidemic diseases, as well as huge environmental threats,\r\nand which helps to achieve multilateral understanding\r\nbetween those participating in this development. Solving\r\nthese problems is becoming the overriding ambition and the\r\nmain goal and hope of the United Nations, as well as of\r\nmankind as a whole.\r\nRight now, the United Nations has started displaying\r\nits capacity to adapt its structure and policies to the\r\ndemands of the future. The orientation of the United\r\nNations towards the future is the overriding goal that was\r\nestablished for it during its fiftieth anniversary celebrations.\r\nThe change of leadership and the measures that are now\r\nbeing undertaken in this direction give sufficient grounds\r\nfor optimism. We declare our support for these goals and\r\nactions. With a sense of trust and the intention to\r\ncontribute, we take note of the actions of the new\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Annan, in regard to reform within\r\nthe United Nations. In this respect, I would like to quote\r\nfrom a letter dated 5 September 1997 sent by the President\r\nof the Republic of Belarus, Mr. Lukashenka, to the\r\nSecretary-General:\r\n“These reforms are a timely and meaningful response\r\nto the objectives facing the United Nations during this\r\ncomplex period at the turning point of the millennia,\r\nincluding problems which ought to be solved with the\r\npurpose of enhancing the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations system.\r\n“The Republic of Belarus is in favour of a\r\npragmatic, comprehensive approach to United\r\nNations reform which would provide for the\r\nstrengthening, on the basis of the opportunities\r\navailable, of the United Nations potential in\r\npeacekeeping, humanitarian and informational\r\nfields.”\r\nIn our opinion, these measures are very important\r\nand represent an up-to-date response to the need to settle\r\nthe issues coming before the United Nations during this\r\ncomplex historical period as we approach the end of the\r\nmillennium. These issues need to be solved in order to\r\nenhance the functional efficiency of the family of the\r\nUnited Nations. When we speak of reform in the United\r\nNations, we have in mind first and foremost an effective\r\ndistribution of United Nations resources, the streamlining\r\nof the Organization’s administrative and organizational\r\nstructures, and budgetary and structural reform of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat, as well as personnel\r\nadjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world.\r\nWhen addressing United Nations reform, we place\r\nspecial emphasis on the reform of the Security Council,\r\nwhich is one of the principal United Nations bodies,\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nExtremely critical in this respect is, of course, the\r\nprinciple of balanced representation of all regional groups\r\nof United Nations Member States on the reformed\r\nSecurity Council. The Republic of Belarus is convinced\r\nthat allocation of one more non-permanent seat on the\r\nSecurity Council to the Group of Eastern European\r\nStates — whose membership has more than doubled in\r\nrecent years — is in full compliance with the provisions\r\nof Article 23 of the United Nations Charter, which sets\r\nforth the principle of equitable geographical distribution.\r\nAmong all the new realities that are being brought\r\ninto the mosaic of international relations, efficient\r\nmechanisms for global and regional security still seem\r\nparamount. Belarus considers its national security to be\r\ninalienably connected and identified with the collective\r\nsecurity system of the European continent. Each State has,\r\nof course, ample right independently to select the most\r\nefficient means of protecting its own national interests,\r\nincluding the right to participate in regional security\r\norganizations.\r\nFor the last two years Belarus has displayed a firm\r\nstance against the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nOrganization (NATO) as a military bloc. I hope for\r\nunderstanding on the part of the international community in\r\nthis respect. In the event that we had on our western\r\nborders not the friendly sovereign Polish State we have\r\nnow but a military organization, it would certainly push us\r\nto seriously analyse and reconsider our national security\r\nconsiderations.\r\nHowever, recently we have noticed developments\r\ninside the NATO structure itself. We took due note of\r\nseveral meetings of NATO member States regarding the\r\ntransformation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council\r\ninto the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, as well as the\r\ntransformation of the major military aims of NATO itself.\r\nTaking into account current realities, we would like to\r\nreiterate our position against NATO’s expansion as a\r\nmilitary organization, but also to add to it that we are in\r\nfavour of its development into a universal European\r\norganization for peace and security. It is with this intention\r\nthat we have entered into negotiations with NATO and\r\npresented a programme for Belarusian participation in the\r\nPartnership for Peace. We sincerely hope that by\r\ndeveloping a more constructive approach we will reach a\r\nmutual understanding, which could be reinforced by some\r\nmutual obligations.\r\nWe would also like to state that with this evolution of\r\nNATO and a thorough analysis of existing world and\r\nregional security systems and treaties, further emphasis\r\nshould be attached to well-established regional\r\norganizations such as the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and to their closer\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies.\r\nAs to the OSCE, we feel certain that it has already\r\naccumulated profound experience and skills in tackling\r\nmany important security issues and is able to make a major\r\ncontribution to strengthening peace and security on the\r\ncontinent. Therefore, the Republic of Belarus readily\r\nsupports the initiatives of Russia and the Netherlands\r\nconcerning a number of special events to commemorate the\r\none hundredth anniversary of the First Peace Conference.\r\nShould this conference take place in 1999, it would be an\r\nimportant opportunity to discuss the complex problems of\r\npeaceful cooperation between Member States and to find\r\nand elaborate means to constructively handle major issues\r\nof contention and also to strengthen the legal foundations\r\nof international actions for peace.\r\nI should like to state that the Republic of Belarus, as\r\none of the founding Members of the United Nations, has\r\nalways spoken strongly in favour of the peaceful\r\nregulation of military conflicts in different regions of the\r\nglobe and of elaborating new and efficient measures to\r\nprevent the emergence of new crisis situations. That is\r\nwhy we share the approach of many who have spoken\r\nhere, when they expressed concern about the development\r\nof the situation in the Middle East. It is our opinion that\r\nthe continuation of the Arab-Israeli dialogue, which will\r\nlive up to the agreements previously reached, is a must to\r\nstop terrorism in this region, to put an end to the non-stop\r\nbloodletting of innocent people and to establish a firm\r\nand lasting peace.\r\nThe same can also be said of the Balkans, which is\r\nnow one of the hottest spots in the European region. We\r\nare convinced that lasting peace in the former Yugoslavia\r\nis possible only under conditions where violence is\r\nrenounced and where the parties involved settle their\r\nconflicts in a peaceful manner.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus invites the General\r\nAssembly to enable the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\r\nas a founding Member, to resume its participation in the\r\nwork of the General Assembly and other bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nUnfortunately, conflicts, including military clashes,\r\nare still a reality of humanity’s everyday existence. We\r\ncall upon the Security Council to be more prudent in\r\nhandling these conflicts, to be more diligent in seeking\r\npeaceful means to regulate them, avoiding at all costs\r\neconomic destruction as well as the political and moral\r\ndamage that comes with attempts to apply sanctions.\r\nI should like to seize this opportunity to confirm the\r\nwillingness of the Government of the Republic of Belarus\r\nto host the Minsk international Conference on conflict\r\nsettlement in Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nAs members know, Belarus has always been among\r\nthose nations which have spoken and acted strongly to\r\nmake effective measures undertaken by the United\r\nNations in the field of disarmament. I should like to\r\nremind the Assembly that Belarus was one of the first\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States countries, after the\r\nbreakup of the Soviet Union, to withdraw nuclear\r\nweapons from its territory. Belarus aims to achieve\r\nfurther progress in the field of disarmament, in particular\r\nby banning chemical, bacteriological and other toxic\r\nweapons, by putting an end to research into new weapons\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nof mass destruction, and by preventing an arms race in\r\nspace. Awareness of these aims means a more secure future\r\nfor our children.\r\nThe Belarusian position on disarmament issues is firm\r\nand logically predictable. Apart from our refusal to station\r\nnuclear weapons on our soil, we have suggested creating a\r\nnuclear-free zone in the centre of Europe. I must admit that\r\nso far the response to this initiative has been tepid, at best.\r\nBut I would also reiterate that no matter the tepid response,\r\nonly the creation of regions entirely free from nuclear\r\nweapons and the nuclear threat will facilitate each important\r\nstep along the road to the eventual comprehensive\r\nrenouncement of nuclear weapons.\r\nApart from general support for the reform programmes\r\nof the United Nations, I should like to emphasize the\r\nparticularly positive approach of Belarus to the idea and the\r\nphilosophy of sustainable development. Pursuant to the\r\ndecisions and recommendations adopted by the Rio 1992\r\nEarth Summit, the Government of the Republic of Belarus\r\nworked out a national strategy for sustainable development,\r\nwhose outline was presented to the General Assembly’s\r\nspecial session last June.\r\nWe appreciate the great assistance rendered to us by\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the United\r\nNations Secretariat and the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Europe, which helped us to hold our\r\nconference on sustainable development in Minsk in April\r\n1997, which was attended by representatives of 30 countries\r\nand more than 30 international organizations. That\r\nconference was an important landmark on the path to\r\nworking out an international strategy for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and outlined many of the important issues that\r\nare now faced by countries in a period of transition. I\r\nsincerely believe that the sustainable development\r\nprogramme launched by the United Nations will encourage\r\nthe participation of other multilateral organizations in its\r\nimplementation, in particular, the World Trade\r\nOrganization, which could advance reforms in countries\r\nwhose economies are in transition by accepting them as full\r\nmembers. We fervently hope that the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, as a long-term policy of the United Nations,\r\nwill not only provide reliable mechanisms to deal with\r\ninternational catastrophes, such as the Chernobyl accident\r\nand others, but will also help establish a system to prevent\r\nsuch catastrophes and eliminate their consequences in all\r\nparts of the world.\r\nI should like to emphasize that the Chernobyl-related\r\nactivities of the United Nations as well as the international\r\nassistance in mitigating the consequences of that nuclear\r\ncatastrophe are highly appreciated by the people of\r\nBelarus. Yet the assistance is needed right now —\r\ntoday — though we will need it in the future as well.\r\nThat is a tragic reality the Republic of Belarus is living\r\nthrough.\r\nAs members are aware, sometimes and in some\r\nareas Belarus has been the object of criticism because of\r\nthe slowness of reform and democratic transformations.\r\nConcern has been expressed regarding certain internal\r\ndevelopments in the Republic of Belarus. While I would\r\ncertainly acknowledge that some of the international\r\ncommunity’s concern has been justified, I would like very\r\nmuch to say that the Republic of Belarus is a sovereign\r\nState that develops its own policy with due regard for the\r\nopportunities — economic, social, moral and\r\npsychological — of its citizens, within the limits of\r\ninternational patterns of behaviour and with respect for\r\nhuman rights and personal freedoms.\r\nIt has been an uneasy path, but so far the Republic\r\nof Belarus has avoided the pitfalls in economic and\r\npolitical areas, and with the due assistance of the\r\ninternational community expects to attain certain\r\nstandards compatible with the developed countries of the\r\nworld. Now we are practically the only country of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States that had a stable\r\neconomic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half\r\nof this year; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of\r\nindustrial production and we are a country free from\r\nreligious, ethnic or civil strife.\r\nOf course, there are many difficulties still ahead of\r\nus. But as long as a consensus of the people is secured on\r\nmajor development programmes and aims, the institutes\r\nof government and democracy are stable, and\r\ninternational cooperation proceeds within acceptable\r\ninternational norms. There is hope that we shall\r\naccomplish the goals set before us.\r\nDifficult as it might be, we have made quite a few\r\npositive steps to assure the United Nations that we are\r\nseriously focused on strengthening our participation in\r\nthis international body. No matter what objective financial\r\nor other economic difficulties Belarus is experiencing, we\r\nseek to fulfil our financial obligations before the United\r\nNations. This year, the Government of Belarus has\r\nallotted the first instalment to gradually liquidate our\r\narrears to the regular United Nations budget, and before\r\nthe year is over we plan to contribute another $5 million.\r\nHowever, we hope more careful consideration can be\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\ngiven to reaching a fair solution in the settlement of the\r\nissue related to the payment by Belarus of its arrears in\r\nfinancial contributions to the United Nations regular budget\r\nand financing the United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nI would take up this issue, not to emphasize the need\r\nto avoid payments, but to invite the international\r\ncommunity to distinguish between the cases when payment\r\nis not made due to objective difficulties and when it results\r\nfrom the absence of will on the part of some Member\r\nStates to contribute in accordance with the principle of the\r\ncapacity to pay, or is an attempt to exert pressure on the\r\nUnited Nations and the policy it implements. There must be\r\na common quest for special solutions to further revise the\r\nscale of assessments, to reconstruct debt in cases where\r\neconomic conditions of this or that Member State do not\r\nallow for the regular payment to be made in time.\r\nDuring the limited time afforded to us, it is not\r\npossible to cover the whole range of problems which\r\nconfront the United Nations and which involve special\r\nactions and responsibilities of Member States. I have\r\noutlined only those which the Government of Belarus\r\nconsiders of the first priority to be addressed in order to\r\nsecure the normal functioning of the United Nations.\r\nI would like to close my statement on a note of\r\ncautious optimism. There are many indicators that the\r\nUnited Nations is advancing in the right direction, and the\r\nparticipation of Member States in the United Nations\r\nprogrammes of settling major global issues is a shade better\r\ntoday than it was yesterday. With all those shades blending\r\ninto a positive optimistic colour, the future of humanity is\r\nmore secure today than it was yesterday, and certainly a lot\r\nmore secure than it was before yesterday.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is His Excellency\r\nMr. Modibo Sidibe, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mali\r\nand for Malians Living Abroad. I give him the floor.\r\nMr. Sidibe (Mali) (interpretation from French): May\r\nI first of all congratulate you, Mr. President, most sincerely\r\non your outstanding election to the presidency of the United\r\nNations General Assembly at its fifty-second session. I have\r\nno doubt that thanks to your eminent qualities and your rich\r\nexperience you will carry out remarkably well the mission\r\nentrusted to you. You may be assured of the complete\r\nsupport of the delegation of Mali.\r\nI also want to express our appreciation and thanks to\r\nyour predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, for the\r\nimportant contribution he made to the last session as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly.\r\nTo the new Secretary-General of the Organization,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, I would like to express my fraternal and\r\nwarmest congratulations. His election on 17 December\r\n1996 was a tribute to the eminent qualities of a man who\r\nhas devoted his life to the service of the United Nations.\r\nWhile wishing him every success in the difficult mission\r\nconferred upon him, it is my firm conviction that he will\r\ndo honour to his continent, Africa, in guiding our\r\nOrganization towards the next millennium.\r\nAs this fifty-second session of the General Assembly\r\nopens this year, the United Nations is at a crossroads.\r\nTwo years ago in this very Hall, on the occasion of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, 128 Heads of\r\nState or Government forcefully reaffirmed their faith in\r\nthe United Nations in its principles and its objectives.\r\nThey unanimously appealed for profound reflection on the\r\nrole and resources of the world Organization so that it\r\nmight be given the human, material and financial\r\ncapacities that are vital to its mission, and so that it might\r\nbe able to enter the twenty-first century with\r\ndetermination and professionalism.\r\nThis appeal was not in vain. Under the dynamic\r\nleadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nwhose courage and lucidity I wish to commend, our\r\nOrganization has today embarked on an ambitious\r\nprogramme of reform. On 14 July last Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\ncontinuing the work of his predecessor, submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly his report on the reform of the United\r\nNations. Like other Member States, Mali is now\r\nconsidering the proposals contained in that report and will\r\nwithout delay submit its observations thereon. My\r\ndelegation is delighted at the political will expressed by\r\nall to initiate the appropriate reforms in order to make our\r\nOrganization better able to respond to the needs of our\r\nday and to the aspirations of the peoples for which it was\r\ncreated.\r\nWhile on the topic of reform, I cannot gloss over the\r\nsubstantial progress made by Member States in the\r\ndifferent working groups of the General Assembly. 1997\r\nwill mark the crowning of sustained efforts, including the\r\nfulfilment of the mandates given to the Working Groups\r\non, respectively, the Agenda for Development and the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system. The\r\nunanimous adoption by the General Assembly of the\r\ndocuments that endorsed the often difficult and\r\npainstaking deliberations of these two Working Groups\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\neloquently reflects our shared will to succeed, by\r\nconsensus, in laying the groundwork for the restructuring\r\nand modernization of our Organization in the priority fields\r\nof development and economic cooperation.\r\nAs for the reform of the Security Council, the high-\r\nlevel Working Group established to study this issue has\r\nmade considerable progress, although concrete measures\r\nhave not been adopted on such fundamental items as the\r\nexpansion and composition of the Council, and thee use of\r\nthe right of veto.\r\nHowever, I welcome the many constructive and often\r\ncomplementary proposals that have enriched the debates\r\nthis year. I am convinced that by redoubling our efforts we\r\nwill be able to benefit from the momentum that has been\r\ncreated, and that we will succeed in restructuring and\r\nmodernizing the Security Council by making it more\r\ndemocratic and credible as well as more legitimate and\r\ntransparent.\r\nThe maintenance of peace and security, we know,\r\nrequires the prevention, management and settlement of\r\ncrises — of which there unfortunately are still a large\r\nnumber, often pernicious. These crises are currently sources\r\nof grave concern to the entire international community, and\r\nparticularly to Africa, where some countries continue to be\r\nafflicted by multifaceted conflicts. In this respect, it is\r\ngratifying to note that significant advances have been made\r\nhere and there towards the restoration of peace and security.\r\nMy delegation is gratified at the dynamic process that\r\nled on 20 July to the holding of general, free and credible\r\nelections in Liberia, marking the end of a long and brutal\r\ncivil war and the establishment in that country of\r\ndemocratic institutions. This victory, which is above all that\r\nof the people of Liberia themselves, must be welcomed as\r\na successful example of the settlement of a regional conflict\r\nand should serve as a source of inspiration for the\r\nsettlement of other crises.\r\nMali, which has played an active role in the settlement\r\nof the Liberian crisis in both the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and its Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG), would like to recall here that assistance for\r\nthe reconstruction of Liberia is the only means of\r\nconsolidating the peace won at such cost. The results\r\nobtained by the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the\r\nImplementation of the Bangui Agreements are a good\r\nexample of the virtues of direct dialogue and of\r\ninternational mediation.\r\nMy country welcomes the positive evolution of the\r\ncrisis in the Central African Republic as a result of the\r\ncommendable efforts of the International Mediation\r\nCommittee established by the Nineteenth Summit Meeting\r\nof Heads of State and Government of France and Africa.\r\nAs regards Western Sahara, my delegation is pleased\r\nwith the progress achieved at the end of the fourth round\r\nof private contacts on the implementation of the United\r\nNations Settlement Plan, with a view to the organization\r\nof a referendum for self-determination.\r\nConversely, the existence of other centres of tension\r\nand breaches of democratic order are of grave concern.\r\nThis is the case in Angola, where the delaying tactics of\r\nthe União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola\r\n(UNITA) are putting a severe strain on the peace process\r\nunder way. My country supports without reservation the\r\nmeasures recently decided upon by the Security Council\r\nrelating to this party to the conflict.\r\nLikewise, in Sierra Leone, the situation is extremely\r\nconfused because of the obstinacy of the leaders of the\r\nmilitary coup d’état in holding on to power in spite of the\r\npressure exerted by the United Nations, the Organization\r\nof African Unity and, more particularly the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States whose select\r\nministerial committee has courageously and selflessly\r\nundertaken difficult negotiations in order to achieve the\r\nre-establishment of constitutional order with the return of\r\nthe democratically elected president.\r\nMy country, which is a member of the International\r\nMediation Committee in the Republic of the Congo, is\r\ngravely concerned by the situation of widespread civil\r\nwar prevailing in that country. Once again, we appeal to\r\nthe sense of responsibility of the parties and ask them to\r\nengage resolutely and very quickly in a political\r\nsettlement of the crisis so that the mediation process can\r\nbe brought to a successful conclusion.\r\nThis crucial moment for Africa is equally crucial for\r\nthe Middle East, where the dynamic of peace that began\r\nwith the Madrid Conference is increasingly being called\r\ninto question by the recent serious events. This is the time\r\nand place to call urgently on the co-sponsors of the peace\r\nprocess and the international community as a whole to\r\ntake further initiatives to safeguard the peace process,\r\ninter alia by persuading the parties to resume the\r\nnegotiations as a matter of urgency with a view to the\r\napplication of the agreements that have been concluded.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nMy country, Mali, also remains concerned by the\r\npersistence of the sanctions against Member States of our\r\nOrganization, in particular the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and\r\nby the suffering the sanctions cause for the peoples of these\r\ncountries.\r\nFor more than 50 years, the realization of the ideal of\r\ndisarmament has been at the centre of our constant concern\r\nto build a system of collective security, free of weapons of\r\nmass destruction. From this viewpoint significant progress\r\nhas been made towards, in particular, the reduction and\r\nultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals. In this respect,\r\nMali welcomes the entry into force on 29 April 1997 of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\r\non Their Destruction.\r\nNevertheless, the objective of general and complete\r\ndisarmament has still to be achieved. On the basis of this\r\nconviction, Mali has demonstrated its commitment to this\r\ngoal by taking concrete initiatives at the international,\r\nregional and national levels. Evidence of this is the\r\nresolution initiated by my country in 1994 and co-sponsored\r\nby about 20 Member States, regarding “Assistance to States\r\nfor curbing the illicit traffic in small arms and collecting\r\nthem”. This initiative by Mali, which contributed to\r\ninitiating the now well-known concept of\r\n“microdisarmament” within our Organization, is aimed at\r\ndrawing the attention of the international community to the\r\ndisastrous consequences of small arms, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping countries where, as we know, they play a large\r\npart in fuelling conflicts.\r\nAll this emphasizes how important it is urgently to\r\nsupport the efforts of the countries of the Saharo-Sahelian\r\nsubregion in order to stem the phenomenon of the\r\nproliferation of small arms, especially through effective\r\ncontrol of borders and the review of legal instruments\r\nregarding the bearing of arms.\r\nAlong the same lines, from 24 to 28 March 1997, the\r\nGovernment of Mali organized, together with the United\r\nNations Department of Political Affairs, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), a “Week of Peace” to commemorate the first\r\nanniversary of the “Flame of Peace”. The international\r\nforum, held on that occasion, which brought together the\r\nrepresentatives of the countries of the subregion and of the\r\ninstitutions and bodies to which I have just referred, gave\r\nan opportunity to analyse the factors that led to the\r\nrestoration of peace in the northern regions of Mali and to\r\nidentify ways and means of ensuring lasting peace and of\r\npromoting a real culture of peace.\r\nI would like here to echo the fervent appeal made at\r\nthat forum for good governance, which favours\r\nparticipation over exclusion and dialogue over\r\nconfrontation, and which assures respect for democratic\r\nprinciples and human rights. I also wish, from this\r\nrostrum, to make an appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to give its full support to the proposal for a\r\nmoratorium on the import, export and production of light\r\nweapons that was formulated during the consultations\r\nheld at the same time as the “Week of Peace”. In addition\r\nto the countries of the West African subregion, these\r\nconsultations brought together representatives of the\r\nUnited Nations, OAU, the ECOWAS/Togo agreement on\r\nnon-aggression and defence assistance (ANAD), and our\r\ndevelopment partners.\r\nFurthermore, the conflicts in recent years have\r\nshown that conventional weapons can also cause mass\r\ndestruction. For that reason my country welcomed the\r\nadoption on 18 September 1997 of the Convention on the\r\ntotal ban of anti-personnel mines, and supports the\r\ninternational efforts, including the Ottawa process, to\r\nachieve the total elimination of anti-personnel mines at\r\nthe global level.\r\nThe values of peace, freedom and economic and\r\nsocial justice which inspired the founding fathers of the\r\nUnited Nations must remain today, more than ever, the\r\nfoundations of the joint action incumbent on us in the\r\nquest for a decent life for everyone. In this respect, we\r\nmust, together and in a united way, seek concerted\r\nsolutions to the persistent problems of underdevelopment.\r\nThus, from New York in 1990, with the World\r\nSummit for Children, to Rome in 1996 with the World\r\nFood Summit, the great international conferences of the\r\ndecade have contributed remarkably to the preparation of\r\na new design for human society at the dawning of the\r\nthird millennium. The paradigm of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, based on economic growth that is sustained,\r\nsocially equitable and ecologically viable, constitutes the\r\ncommon denominator on which the international\r\ncommunity now agrees in order to give new direction to\r\nthe collective search for the economic and social well-\r\nbeing of our peoples. The mixed results of last June’s\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to an\r\noverall evaluation of the implementation of Agenda 21\r\nare a sharp reminder of the vital need to think for our\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nworld globally and act collectively to meet the challenges\r\nconfronting our planet.\r\nRegardless of the angle from which we approach\r\nthem, the problems at the end of this century cannot be\r\nresolved except through concerted and integrated action —\r\naction capable of managing harmoniously the upheavals\r\naccompanying this changing period of history. The\r\nconsensus achieved in the Agenda for Development shows\r\nour shared faith in the virtues of a new global partnership\r\nfor development, based on the imperative of\r\ninterdependence and on mutually beneficial action.\r\nSince the conceptual framework has been defined and\r\naccepted by all, it is now time — and high time — to move\r\nto action through a rational mobilization of resources in\r\nkeeping with the generous goals formulated in the Agenda\r\nfor Development.\r\nThe settlement of the debt crisis, just remuneration for\r\ncommodities, the renunciation of trade barriers and an\r\nincrease in official development assistance — this is\r\nessentially the direction that needs to be taken in order to\r\nbuild a world that is more accommodating to all, so true is\r\nit that our global village cannot be built in a lasting way if\r\nthe majority of its members are excluded. The fight against\r\npoverty in this context has absolute priority, because it is\r\nsimply unacceptable at the dawning of the third millennium\r\nthat millions of men and women throughout the world\r\nshould continue to lack the minimal conditions for a decent\r\nlife. The aspiration of peoples for a better life is a\r\nlegitimate quest which cannot be ignored.\r\nAs Mali sees it, any work towards sustainable\r\ndevelopment is above all a national responsibility, through\r\nthe effective definition and application of sound\r\nmacroeconomic policies, based on transparency, the pre-\r\neminent rule of law, the practice of democracy, respect for\r\nhuman rights, social justice, and the participation of all in\r\nthe effort of national development. For my country, this is\r\nthe surest path to follow in our quest for the shared ideal\r\nassigned to us by the United Nations Charter:\r\n“to promote social progress and better standards of life\r\nin larger freedom”.\r\nWe are on the eve of a new millennium, which will\r\nsee the emergence of new challenges and new threats, but\r\nalso of great dreams and hopes for humankind.\r\nAs responsible leaders of our States, we have an\r\nobligation to seek ways and means to meet these\r\nchallenges. But we also need to guide in the right\r\ndirection the aspirations of our peoples to live in peace,\r\nliberty, progress and active solidarity.\r\nFifty-two years ago the founding fathers of our\r\nOrganization cleared the way for us to attain these noble\r\nobjectives, which are still relevant. If we apply the terms\r\nof the Charter, we will be able to respond to particular\r\nuncertainties and put an end to the climate of doubt, fear\r\nand suspicion that characterizes present day international\r\nrelations.\r\nWe must also agree to do more and to do better in\r\nour quest for a better future for the human race. We\r\nbelieve in the United Nations as the institution to help us\r\nachieve this.\r\nThe President of the Republic of Mali, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Alpha Oumar Konaré, is convinced that\r\na restructured, modernized United Nations, endowed with\r\nthe essential capacity to act, can help to resolve our\r\ndisputes, ensure more orderly management of world\r\naffairs and eliminate the injustice, disparity and egoism\r\nthat threaten humankind.\r\nThat is why my country, Mali, will continue to work\r\nwith enthusiasm and determination to ensure the\r\nemergence of a United Nations that is truly united in its\r\ndiversity, at peace with itself and resolutely committed to\r\nthe service of all peoples.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister of State\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\r\nGabon, His Excellency Mr. Casimir Oye Mba.\r\nMr. Oye Mba (Gabon) (interpretation from French):\r\nAt the outset I should like to convey to you, Sir, the\r\nwarm congratulations of the Government of Gabon and of\r\nmy delegation on your outstanding election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. I\r\nshould also like to congratulate the other members of the\r\nBureau.\r\nIn selecting you, Mr. President, our Assembly\r\nacknowledged your country’s role in world politics and,\r\nabove all, your personal qualities, which augur well for\r\nthe success of this session. I am indeed convinced that\r\nunder your guidance our work will be directed towards\r\ncontinuing our discussions in greater depth, taking\r\ncommon positions on important issues and adopting\r\nresolutions with the broadest possible consensus.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nI should like to express our appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Razali, for the excellent\r\nwork he did during his presidency.\r\nThis is also the first opportunity I have had to express\r\nmy heartfelt congratulations to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, on his election as head of our\r\nOrganization. I assure him of Gabon’s full support for all\r\nthe efforts he will need to make to ensure the success of\r\nthe action he takes in the service of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Mohammed (Ethiopia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nIt is often said that the international context has\r\nchanged, that the fields of activity of the States that we\r\nrepresent are being subjected to attacks on all sides as\r\nscience and technology progress. The globalization of our\r\neconomies, based on the proclaimed virtues of liberalism,\r\nhas not yet yielded all that it could.\r\nThe new world order that we have so long hoped for\r\nhas not yet arrived, because so many contradictions are\r\nwoven into the fabric of international relations. Yet no one\r\ncan fail to see that it represents both the matrix and the\r\nsupport essential to carrying out the reform of the United\r\nNations so that it can better serve peace among nations and\r\nthe development of their peoples.\r\nI should like first to speak about peace, the chief\r\nwealth of nations, and I shall do so, of course, in the light\r\nof our own experience.\r\nIn Gabon our understanding of peace underlies all the\r\npolitical developments we have experienced and are still\r\nexperiencing today. The organization of successive local,\r\nlegislative and senatorial elections in a calm political and\r\nsocial context at the end of 1996 and early this year\r\nprovided proof of the fundamental role of the democratic\r\nlegitimacy sorely needed today for the exercise of political\r\npower.\r\nThis same perception underlies all the activities of\r\nwhich we are the beneficiaries and which have made\r\nGabon, through the personal presence of its President,\r\nOmar Bongo, a country that enjoys the great friendship and\r\ntrust of other members of the international community,\r\nespecially its neighbours.\r\nIn fact, Gabon has contributed in a substantial and\r\nsignificant manner to easing the tension in many parts of\r\nAfrica.\r\nGabon, together with Chad, Burkina Faso, Senegal\r\nand Mali, sent almost 300 soldiers as part of an African\r\npeacekeeping force to restore institutional stability in the\r\nCentral African Republic.\r\nOn behalf of my country I should like to pay tribute\r\nto the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the\r\nImplementation of the Bangui Agreements, established by\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nGiven the very disturbing situation in Congo\r\n(Brazzavile), and at the request of the Congolese parties,\r\nGabon agreed to take charge of the international\r\nmediation committee, under the leadership of His\r\nExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, assisted by the joint\r\nUnited Nations/Organization of African Unity Special\r\nRepresentative, Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun. A\r\nsimilar request had already been made to President Bongo\r\nby our Congolese brothers during earlier crises, in 1992\r\nand 1993. The current crisis, which erupted in early July\r\n1997, is the longest and the most bloody — the official\r\ndeath toll is 4,000 to 5,000 — and the most complex.\r\nDespite the many obstacles that this mediation effort\r\nis encountering, Gabon is doing its utmost to find a\r\npositive solution to this conflict. It is essentially a\r\npolitical and internal conflict, but it must be clear to\r\neveryone that the situation could drift out of control, with\r\nrepercussions at the subregional and international levels.\r\nEven so, as the French writer Beaumarchais said,\r\n“As success becomes more difficult to achieve, the\r\nneed for action becomes more pressing.”\r\nIn this connection, I am pleased to note the\r\nencouraging reaction of the international community in\r\ngeneral, and more specifically, of the European Union and\r\nFrance, which have voiced their support and renewed\r\ntheir expression of trust in international mediation and in\r\nthe Head of State of Gabon, and have urged him to\r\ncontinue his efforts.\r\nTo give the Assembly an idea of what has been\r\ndone, I would just like briefly to mention that President\r\nBongo has proposed, on the one hand, a ceasefire\r\nagreement and, on the other, a political agreement to\r\ncover the transitional period from now until the\r\npresidential elections.\r\nThe draft political agreement is the fifth one\r\nproposed since the negotiations began. It is based on the\r\nidea of power-sharing and the balanced participation of all\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\npolitical forces in terms of holding power during the\r\ntransitional period. The breakdown is as follows.\r\nMr. Lissouba will remain as President of the Republic and\r\nHead of State. To counterbalance this, as it were, a Prime\r\nMinister, the Head of Government, will be appointed by the\r\nPresident from among the members of the Opposition. In\r\naddition, three Vice-Presidents of the Republic are to be\r\nappointed by the Head of State.\r\nWe were unable to finalize this draft agreement during\r\nthe discussions. Things started to happen quickly in\r\nBrazzaville: fighting continued; Mr. Kolelas, the Mayor of\r\nBrazzaville, who had been heading the national mediation\r\nefforts, was appointed Prime Minister; and a Government\r\nwas set up. Of course, all this has meant that negotiations\r\nare on hold.\r\nAgainst this background of uncertainty, President\r\nBongo invited nine Heads of State of Central and Western\r\nAfrica to a special meeting on the Congo which was held\r\nin Libreville on 14 and 15 September 1997. President\r\nLissouba was unable to join his colleagues but he sent his\r\nPrime Minister, Mr. Kolelas.\r\nThe Libreville summit reaffirmed support for\r\ninternational mediation efforts led by President Bongo. It\r\nalso made an urgent appeal to the warring factions to stop\r\nfighting and resolutely to continue with negotiations to try\r\nand find a political settlement to the crisis. So far, I have\r\nto say, the appeal has not met with the reaction on the\r\nground we had hoped for. But we are still hopeful that\r\ndiscussions will soon be resumed, for this is the only way\r\nwe are going to find a lasting and constructive settlement.\r\nFaced with this situation, what have we done here in\r\nthe United Nations? I should remind the Assembly that very\r\nsoon after international mediation began, the President of\r\nthe Republic of Gabon called for a commitment from the\r\ninternational community in terms of deploying an\r\ninternational force to separate the warring factions in Congo\r\n(Brazzaville).\r\nSeveral African countries in a commendable upsurge\r\nof solidarity, responded favourably, expressing their\r\nwillingness to provide troops for the international force.\r\nPresident Bongo brought the matter before the Security\r\nCouncil, which said it accepted the principle, but which\r\nimposed various conditions that, when analysed, leave one\r\nwith the impression that if they were met there would be\r\npractically no point in sending the force.\r\nTime is passing. Time is of the essence. Congolese\r\npeople are still dying; others are fleeing their country; and\r\nthousands more are still wandering, distraught and\r\ndesperate, in the forests of the Congo, seeking makeshift\r\nshelter.\r\nCan we really continue calmly to sit in Manhattan or\r\nin the offices of our capitals and discuss what is going\r\non? We know that in the recent past in other parts of the\r\nworld the same cunning preventive measures — I was\r\ngoing to say the same procrastination — did not prevail.\r\nNo, we must do something for the Congolese people.\r\nThey are citizens of the world, our world, as well.\r\nI must emphasize this: the impact of armed conflicts\r\nis so great that it is more necessary than ever to stress\r\nspecific measures to prevent them. For developing\r\ncountries, like mine, that cannot and must not afford the\r\nluxury of high military expenditure, the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security must be provided for\r\n“upstream” on the basis of preventive measures. It is\r\nbecause we believe deeply in this principle that the States\r\nin our subregion, Members of the United Nations\r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\r\nCentral Africa have been cooperating and taking action\r\nsince 1992 to strengthen mutual trust and security at the\r\nsubregional level.\r\nThese contacts have led, inter alia, to the signing in\r\nYaoundé in July 1996, by virtually all the members of\r\nthis Committee — except one — of a non-aggression\r\npact, which is an important measure to strengthen peace.\r\nMore recently, at its ninth Ministerial Meeting, last\r\nJuly in Libreville, attended by four out of five\r\nrepresentatives of the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil, we adopted a major plan of action whose main\r\nthrust is: the establishment of an early-warning\r\nmechanism as a way of preventing conflict in Central\r\nAfrica; the organization in the medium term of a regional\r\nconference on democratic institutions and peace in Central\r\nAfrica; and training seminars for law enforcement\r\npersonnel on peacekeeping operations, with the goal of\r\npreparing countries of the subregion to participate, with\r\nUnited Nations assistance, in possible future peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nIn my capacity as Chairman of the Bureau of that\r\nCommittee, I should like to draw the keen attention of all\r\nexecutive bodies operating under the aegis of the United\r\nNations and the European Union, and our partners in the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nsubregion, to the benefits of effectively establishing this\r\nearly-warning mechanism before the end of 1997.\r\nStill in that capacity, I wish to appeal to all Member\r\nStates and to the international community as a whole to\r\ncontribute to the Trust Fund set up by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to finance the work of the Committee.\r\nLooking at the crises that have erupted recently in\r\nCentral Africa, I have to say that today the subregion is\r\nfacing the possibility of many conflicts flaring up, involving\r\npopulations beyond our national boundaries, threatening the\r\nstability of our States and even calling into question the\r\nprinciple of the inviolability of borders — a principle that\r\nthe Organization of African Unity has held dear since its\r\ninception. The danger is real. We must ward it off.\r\nThrough me, Gabon welcomes the United States\r\ninitiative to convene a special meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil on the situation in Africa, the first of its kind. We\r\nare grateful for the fact that on that solemn occasion, on 25\r\nSeptember 1997, the Security Council reaffirmed its\r\nprincipal responsibility for the preservation of peace on our\r\ncontinent.\r\nBut how can we forget that United Nations files are\r\nbursting with piles of reports, declarations and resolutions\r\non Africa, all of them equally relevant?\r\nEveryone here will recall that some 10 years ago the\r\nGeneral Assembly held a special session on Africa. Yes, I\r\nknow — they say that now that the cold war has ended\r\nAfrica is no longer of prime strategic importance. Too bad\r\nfor us! For my part, I would say “So much the better for\r\nus”, because we Africans have no reason to cry over the\r\nfall of the Berlin Wall. That was a tremendously important\r\nevent for us too; it opened up new prospects. Today,\r\nhowever, the African peoples, just like others, are no longer\r\nwilling to be paid in words and slogans. They thus expect\r\nconcrete measures to emerge from the special meeting that\r\nwas held by the Security Council last week.\r\nAlthough Africa is no longer of prime strategic\r\nimportance, is Africa not today, where the United Nations\r\nis concerned, its real challenge, I might even say its guilty\r\nconscience — because of the Organization’s underlying\r\nphilosophy and vocation?\r\nLooking beyond Africa, Gabon is also greatly\r\nconcerned over the blockage in the Middle East process,\r\nand we invite all the parties there to resume the dialogue,\r\nwith the support of the whole of the international\r\ncommunity, for there, as elsewhere, no lasting solution\r\ncan be achieved through force.\r\nThe wars and conflicts we all deplore are made\r\npossible by the devastating force of weapons. We must\r\ntherefore patiently and resolutely succeed in disarming the\r\nnations of the world.\r\nThus, we welcome the progress made in this area by\r\nthe entry into force of the Convention on the prohibition\r\nof chemical weapons, which demonstrates the will of the\r\ninternational community to eliminate that category of\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn the same connection, my country supports the\r\nOttawa process aimed at a complete ban on anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. The recent Oslo Diplomatic Conference on\r\nthat subject worked along the lines we had hoped it\r\nwould. We regret, however, that some countries were\r\nunable to join in the powerful and promising consensus\r\nthat emerged there. We trust that in the near future they\r\nwill be able to do so. The representative I sent to Oslo\r\ntold me that some of those present had tried to establish\r\nfor those weapons a special category that they would be\r\nable to retain, a category of what they called “intelligent”\r\nanti-personnel mines. I do not know what that means.\r\nIntelligent or stupid, anti-personnel mines kill, and they\r\noften kill the innocent. They must therefore be banned. If\r\nwhile playing in a field your child’s leg is torn off by a\r\nso-called intelligent mine, you would find no consolation\r\nin the thought that the mine was an intelligent one.\r\nIn any event, Gabon urges all United Nations\r\nMember States to bend all their efforts towards adopting\r\na plan of action for general and complete disarmament.\r\nHumanity will be the better for it.\r\nWe are not sufficiently aware of the human suffering\r\nthat underlies armed conflicts, particularly the suffering of\r\nthe victims, and especially of women, the elderly and\r\nchildren, for killing them means killing the life, the past\r\nand the future of the human race. In that connection, one\r\ncan only employ the word “abominable” in describing the\r\ngrowing use of children in conflicts.\r\nOver the past decade a million children have been\r\nkilled, 6 million have been seriously wounded or\r\nhandicapped for life, more than a million have been\r\norphaned or separated from their families, and millions of\r\nothers are suffering serious psychological damage. This\r\ndark picture is even darker in Africa than in other\r\ncontinents. That is why Gabon, a party to the United\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child and a\r\nsignatory of the Charter of the Rights and Welfare of the\r\nAfrican Child, joins the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) in condemning the use of children as soldiers\r\nand urges Governments and all combatants on the\r\nbattlefield to halt a number of particularly shameful\r\npractices, namely, the recruitment of children into the\r\narmed forces, the participation of children in combat, and\r\nviolations and abuses to which they are often subjected.\r\nIn another area, the Gabonese authorities are deeply\r\nconcerned by the struggle against the scourges of crime and\r\ndrug proliferation, which are other sources of human\r\nsuffering. We have taken a number of initiatives to combat\r\nthem, including the reorganization of our security services\r\nand the creation of an interministerial commission to\r\ncombat drug addiction. However, combating those\r\nphenomena clearly calls for resolution and determined acts\r\nof solidarity and cooperation at the international level.\r\nTurning now to the question of development, I should\r\nlike to recall that the final goal of government is the well-\r\nbeing of peoples.\r\nAgainst that background, the international community\r\nhas evidenced its will to improve the human condition by\r\norganizing various workshops, seminars and conferences. I\r\nwould just mention the Rio Conference on the environment,\r\nthe Vienna Conference on human rights, the Beijing\r\nConference on women, the Cairo Conference on population,\r\nthe Copenhagen Conference on social development and the\r\nStockholm Conference on the sexual exploitation of\r\nchildren, as well as the very latest special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the mid-term review of\r\nAgenda 21.\r\nHowever, even after all those meetings that aroused\r\nsuch hopes, it looks as though our community is not truly\r\ndetermined to fulfil the obligations it has freely entered\r\ninto. It seems to be difficult to translate proclaimed\r\nintentions into action.\r\nGabon therefore hopes that there will be greater\r\nmovement towards action at the forthcoming Kyoto\r\nConference on climate change, which will be a test of the\r\nindustrialized countries’ commitments to sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSimilarly, we would encourage the International\r\nSeabed Authority to continue its work, particularly on the\r\nelaboration of a balanced mining code that takes into\r\naccount the interests of all States as well as environmental\r\nquestions.\r\nThe importance of the eight most developed\r\ncountries and their real ability to have an impact on the\r\ninternational economy give us ground to hope that the\r\ncommitments entered into at the recent Denver summit\r\nwill enable us to work towards strengthening an\r\ninternational economy at the service of humanity.\r\nThis may sound like a litany of ills, but until the\r\nsituation improves we must continue to repeat that Africa\r\nis suffering from very serious structural problems. These\r\nconsist, inter alia, of economies, often based on a single\r\ncrop, that are dependent on the outside world;\r\ndeterioration in the terms of trade; reverse finance flow;\r\nthe lowest level of development; the largest number of\r\nleast developed countries and of displaced persons and\r\nrefugees.\r\nHowever, I think it is important to highlight the fact\r\nthat in addition to its potential, which it owes to raw\r\nmaterials, Africa also represents an effective market of\r\nmore than 700 million inhabitants.\r\nWe know that if it is to develop, our continent must\r\nfirst and foremost rely on itself. Yet there is so much to\r\nbe done. We are familiar with the slogan, “Trade, not\r\naid”. It is not entirely untrue. But would it be outrageous\r\nto say that it is not completely true either, because it is\r\nobvious that in Africa there exist countries whose\r\ndevelopment level is already allowing them to cherish\r\nsome legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on the\r\ninternational market as well as countries that still require\r\nassistance, at least in certain areas, and particularly in the\r\nsocial area. To the latter countries, it would be better to\r\nsay: “Trade and aid”.\r\nIt is in that spirit that Gabon will attend the ninth\r\nsummit of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States\r\n(ACP) associated with the European Union in the context\r\nof the Lomé Convention. My country will have the\r\nhonour of hosting this summit in its capital on 6 and 7\r\nNovember 1997. I take this opportunity to say to the ACP\r\ncountries — and all of them are here at the General\r\nAssembly — that we are ready to welcome them next\r\nmonth and that we await them all.\r\nGabon is a beneficiary of the international economic\r\nenvironment, and I would therefore like to share with the\r\nAssembly our experience in this area.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nSince mid-1995, Gabon’s economic performance has\r\nimproved considerably. The rate of growth has increased\r\nsignificantly; inflation has been reduced to a very low level;\r\nand our situation outside the country has been strengthened.\r\nStructural measures and administrative reform are\r\naccelerating. The Government is stepping up the\r\nliberalization of the economy and the cleaning up of the\r\nbusiness environment. A vast programme of privatizing\r\npublic enterprises has already been put into effect. It began\r\nwith the Gabon Water and Energy Company. The\r\nprivatization was carried out in very orderly and transparent\r\nconditions — to the surprise of not a few — and the\r\nprogramme will be continued in other spheres.\r\nAware of the decisive role the private sector has to\r\nplay in Gabon’s prosperity and in increasing the standard of\r\nliving of its people, our Government is trying to establish\r\na legal and regulatory environment which will facilitate\r\nprivate investment and open up various sectors of the\r\neconomy to competition. We sincerely state that Gabon is\r\nopen to all private investment. As President Bongo likes to\r\nsay, “Gabon is not the private reserve of anybody”.\r\nThe Gabonese authorities are making sure that our\r\ncommitments in the area of loans and repayments are\r\nrealistic and viable. They call for appropriate treatment in\r\nrespect of our foreign public debt, because the strict\r\ndeadlines for repayment often hamper our efforts to\r\nrevitalize our economy.\r\nFinally, partnership in all areas must be strengthened\r\nand the transfer of technologies encouraged, so that the\r\nnational capacities of our countries can be revitalized.\r\nIn his speech to the General Assembly, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral expressed the hope that this session will be known\r\nas the Reform Assembly. Indeed, the world today is not\r\nwhat it was in 1945. Our Organization must adapt to the\r\nnew realities. Gabon therefore welcomes the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General for the reform\r\nof the Organization.\r\nThe current discussions must result in consensus\r\nmachinery that will safeguard the various interests of the\r\nMember States. But it remains true that no reform plan can\r\nbe successful until the financial situation of the United\r\nNations is cured.\r\nMy country recalls that we attach great priority to the\r\nrecommendations formulated by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity at its last summit, in Harare, and to the\r\nproposals made by the Non-Aligned Movement at its\r\nMinisterial Conference in New Delhi in April 1997.\r\nPresident Bongo spoke as long ago as 1977 on the\r\nquestion of an increase in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil, and I had the occasion to repeat his position\r\nbefore the General Assembly in 1995 and 1996. Let me\r\nrepeat it one more time. Gabon suggests that we can\r\nreconcile the seemingly contradictory requirements in this\r\nway: by eliminating the geographical imbalance in the\r\nSecurity Council so as to consolidate its legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness; by making the decision-making process in\r\nthe Council more democratic; and by allowing for a fairer\r\nrepresentation of Africa. Africa calls for two permanent\r\nseats, with the same rights the other permanent members\r\nhave; the seats would be rotated in accordance with\r\nprinciples that the African Group will submit in due time\r\nto the General Assembly.\r\nGabon reaffirms here its commitment to the\r\nprinciples of universality and the sovereign equality of\r\nStates. These should underlie all the thinking in regard to\r\nreform.\r\nIt is my hope that this session of the General\r\nAssembly will enable us to take another step towards\r\nstrengthening the ideals we all share.\r\nThis transition towards a more humane world will\r\nnot be without perils. We will have to combat\r\nsimultaneously the upsurge of selfishness and the\r\ndevelopment of false solidarity, which can lead our\r\npeoples to fratricidal struggle.\r\nI am convinced that, united, we will take up the\r\nchallenge to build a better world.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Tourism and Acting Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Zambia, His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Amusaa K. Mwanamwambwa. I now call on\r\nhim.\r\nMr. Mwanamwambwa (Zambia): I am pleased to\r\nconvey the congratulations of the Zambian delegation to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election\r\nas President of the fifty-second session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. This session is especially\r\nimportant in that it is meant to give impetus to the\r\nongoing negotiations on the future structure of the United\r\nNations through the reform process. We are confident that\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nwith his proven diplomatic skills he will steer the\r\ndeliberations of this session to a successful conclusion.\r\nFor his predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of\r\nMalaysia, my delegation has only words of admiration and\r\ngratitude for the exemplary work he did during the past\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI wish to express my delegation’s satisfaction with the\r\nskilful manner in which the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, has managed the affairs of the Organization since\r\nhis election last year. Zambia is confident that, given his\r\ntested managerial and diplomatic skills, he will effectively\r\nmanage this Organization as it deals with critical issues\r\nconfronting the international community today.\r\nAt the fiftieth session, world leaders gathered here to\r\ncelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations. In celebrating the occasion, we took time\r\nto assess the contribution of the United Nations to world\r\npeace, economic and social development, and the\r\nobservance of fundamental human rights, and we reaffirmed\r\nour faith in the Organization and agreed to vigorously live\r\nup to the objectives of the Charter by strengthening and\r\nrevitalizing the United Nations system.\r\nIt is against this background that my delegation\r\nbelieves that the current session of the General Assembly\r\nshould seize the opportunity to advance the reform process\r\nfurther. In this regard, it is Zambia’s conviction that a\r\ncomprehensive approach to United Nations reform would,\r\napart from improving efficiency and effectiveness, ensure\r\nthe implementation of the programmes of action of the\r\nglobal conferences of the 1990s — from Rio to Cairo;\r\nCopenhagen to Beijing and Istanbul — which underscored\r\nthe importance of sustainable development and made it a\r\ncentral theme and a priority. These conferences provided a\r\nstarting point for a global effort in advancing sustainable\r\ndevelopment, set goals and defined broad plans of action\r\nthat provided the basis on which national and international\r\nactions could proceed.\r\nWhile we have agreed on the necessity of reforming\r\nour Organization, it is important to ask ourselves what we\r\nwant to achieve through these reforms. In principle, Zambia\r\nwelcomes and has carefully studied the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals and measures on the negotiations for reform of\r\nthe United Nations. My delegation expects that the reform\r\nprocess would not only result in a more democratic,\r\nefficient, effective and financially stable United Nations, but\r\nalso have a significant impact on economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Zambia would like to see the development\r\nmandate of the United Nations given priority and\r\nprominence in these reforms.\r\nRelated to this reform process is the pressing issue\r\nof the critical financial situation of the United Nations. It\r\nis our view that this state of affairs is the major limiting\r\nfactor undermining the ability of the United Nations to\r\ndeal adequately with its mandates in many areas. We\r\nwould therefore like to see arrears owed to the\r\nOrganization paid in full, on time and without\r\npreconditions.\r\nOne of the key components of the reforms of the\r\nUnited Nations is the reform of the Security Council. We\r\ndemand that the expansion of the Security Council make\r\nit more representative and more democratic. This\r\nexpansion should be at both permanent and non-\r\npermanent levels of membership. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation wishes to state categorically its support for the\r\nposition adopted by the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement that the expanded\r\nSecurity Council should have 26 members.\r\nZambia further supports the demand that the regions\r\nof Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nnow deserve seats as permanent members on an expanded\r\nSecurity Council. Africa, commanding nearly 30 per cent\r\nof the membership of the United Nations, certainly\r\ndeserves to have two permanent and three non-permanent\r\nseats on the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation reaffirms its commitment to general\r\nand complete disarmament. In this spirit, we would also\r\nlike to welcome the recent agreement reached in Oslo.\r\nNorway, to ban anti-personnel landmines. We hope that\r\nall countries of the world will be able to sign the\r\nagreement in December this year in Ottawa.\r\nInternational peace and security also continues to be\r\nthreatened by conflicts around the globe. Africa, in\r\nparticular, has witnessed many civil wars whose\r\nconsequences have been devastating.\r\nZambia continues to be concerned about the conflicts\r\nin the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, the Republic\r\nof Congo, Sudan and elsewhere on the continent. We\r\nwould like to appeal to the parties to these conflicts to\r\ncommit themselves to the principle of negotiated and\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. We call upon the\r\ninternational community to provide all necessary\r\nassistance for resolving these conflicts at an early stage.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nIn Angola, the civil war has caused some of the worst\r\nhuman suffering. As host to the talks that led to the signing\r\nof the Lusaka Protocol, Zambia has a firm desire to ensure\r\nthat there is lasting peace and security in Angola. However,\r\nZambia is disappointed at the failure of the União Nacional\r\npara a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to comply\r\nwith its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol and the\r\nprovisions of relevant Security Council resolutions. Zambia\r\nwould like to record its displeasure at UNITA’s\r\nintransigence.\r\nZambia, together with the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) and other countries, will\r\ncontinue its efforts to promote conditions leading to the\r\nestablishment of lasting peace and security in Angola. We\r\nbelieve that peace in Angola will enlarge the parameters of\r\npeace in southern Africa, which will enable the countries of\r\nthe region to concentrate their efforts on social and\r\neconomic development in an environment of democracy.\r\nZambia reaffirms the position of the OAU with regard\r\nto the situation in Sierra Leone. In this regard, we appeal\r\nto the international community to continue to deny\r\nrecognition to the military junta in Sierra Leone. We\r\ndemand that the junta hand power back to the\r\ndemocratically elected Government of Sierra Leone.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo has just\r\nemerged from a seven-month civil war. We are delighted\r\nthat the country has now begun to turn its attention to the\r\nchallenges of reconstruction and development. We thus\r\nappeal to the international community to unconditionally\r\nassist the new administration in that country in facilitating\r\nrehabilitation of infrastructure and capacity-building to\r\nconsolidate the political and economic stability of the\r\ncountry.\r\nWe congratulate the people of Liberia on finding\r\npeace through the democratic process and also take this\r\nopportunity to pay tribute to the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) for the\r\ncommendable role it has played in resolving the Liberian\r\nconflict.\r\nRegarding peacekeeping in Africa, we believe that\r\nAfrica has the primary responsibility for resolving the\r\nconflicts on our continent. It is precisely for this reason that\r\nthe Organization of African Unity established the\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution, which we hope the international community\r\nwill fully support.\r\nOn the economic front, Zambia is gratified to note\r\nthat sub-Saharan Africa has begun to record positive\r\ngrowth rates, which averaged 5 per cent in 1996, the\r\nhighest level in 20 years. Much of this success is\r\nattributable to the social and economic reforms\r\nundertaken by many African countries. However, this\r\npositive achievement can be sustained only if poverty,\r\ndeprivation and marginalization are effectively addressed.\r\nAnother factor that continues to constrain efforts for\r\nsustainable development in many African countries,\r\nincluding my own, is the heavy external debt burden.\r\nZambia welcomes the steps taken by the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank to implement the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. We are,\r\nhowever, gravely concerned about the uncertainties\r\nsurrounding the funding for the Initiative. We also remain\r\nconcerned about the proliferation of conditions, in\r\nparticular the use of non-economic factors in determining\r\naccess to the Initiative.\r\nZambia believes that the United Nations has a duty\r\nto provide leadership in forging international consensus\r\non the crippling external debt problem of developing\r\ncountries and assisting in the mobilization of new\r\nresources for development financing. It is also our\r\nexpectation that the United Nations will provide\r\nleadership in redressing the widening development\r\ndisparities existing among nations, and addressing the\r\nincreasing trends towards unfair trading practices and\r\nprotectionism in international trade, which have had the\r\neffect of marginalizing some regions, notably Africa.\r\nZambia is very concerned about the continued\r\ndecline in official development assistance at a time when\r\nthe United Nations is dealing with follow-up to recent\r\ninternational conferences on development. There is also\r\nincreasing evidence of lack of enthusiasm for honouring\r\nagreements freely entered into at international\r\nconferences. A case in point is the failure by\r\nGovernments to implement the agreements, commitments\r\nand recommendations made at the 1992 United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly held\r\nthis past June to review progress in implementation of the\r\nRio agreements found that the rate of implementation of\r\nthe programme of action has been extremely slow, mainly\r\ndue to lack of resources. It was also evident that there\r\nwas a marked lack of political will to ensure the\r\nfulfilment of the agreements of the Rio consensus on\r\nenvironment and development. Zambia would therefore\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nlike to see, during this session of the General Assembly,\r\nprogress on the proposal to convene an international\r\nconference on the financing of development. As we all are\r\naware, there has been little progress on this proposal since\r\nthe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, when it\r\nemerged.\r\nOn the domestic front, we in Zambia have adopted\r\nnational programmes of action in pursuit of the goals and\r\nobjectives of the Copenhagen World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment, the Cairo Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment and the Beijing Declaration. In implementing\r\nthese programmes of action, my Government has targeted\r\nthe most vulnerable members of our society to enhance the\r\ncapacity of their involvement in the country’s economic and\r\nsocial life, with a view to raising their standards of living.\r\nIn this regard, the Government has taken steps to ensure\r\nthat there is equitable access to quality education by all\r\nZambians by providing universal basic education within the\r\nshortest realistic time-frame. A comprehensive programme\r\nof health reforms is also under way, and this should also\r\nresult in the improvement of the health status of our people.\r\nThe measures and programmes that the Government has\r\nundertaken are not, however, sufficient to fully attain the\r\nobjectives of these programmes of action, mainly due to\r\nlimited financial resources.\r\nWe wish to conclude by underscoring the continuing\r\nrelevance of the United Nations. The case for reform has\r\nbeen made. We owe it to ourselves and to future\r\ngenerations to ensure that we apply ourselves to the task of\r\nreform, knowing well that the world needs a United Nations\r\nthat can be relied upon to act effectively in ensuring peace\r\nand security, and in achieving international cooperation in\r\nthe economic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields, as\r\nenvisaged in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands, His Excellency The Honourable Phillip Muller.\r\nMr. Muller (Marshall Islands): I wish to take this\r\nopportunity, on behalf of the Government of the Republic\r\nof the Marshall Islands, to congratulate Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko on his election and to commend the President of\r\nthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly for a job\r\nwell done.\r\nMy delegation has stressed the importance of\r\nsustainable development ever since we first became a\r\nMember of the United Nations. Our convictions and our\r\nsupport were most recently reiterated by His Excellency\r\nThe Honourable Imata Kabua, President of the Republic\r\nof the Marshall Islands, at the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to review Agenda 21. It is, and will\r\nremain, the cornerstone of the Government’s policy, but\r\nI must recall the sentiments that we have often voiced:\r\nsustainable development is not the easiest path to travel\r\nfor a small country like the Marshall Islands. There are\r\nnumerous obstacles which we must face and which are\r\nimpeding our progress. Please let me try to put this into\r\nbetter perspective.\r\nPopulation growth in the Marshall Islands and in\r\nmany parts of the Pacific is of great concern to our\r\nGovernments. It has been as high as 4.2 per cent but now\r\nappears to be slowing down to 3.5 per cent. This is\r\nnevertheless far too high a figure for our small country to\r\nsustain. With rather limited resource bases to begin with,\r\nit is difficult to imagine what job opportunities will have\r\nto be created for new generations. We are already facing\r\nproblems with layoffs in the public sector. Granted, it was\r\nmuch too large. It was at one point almost 60 per cent of\r\nthe work force but is now down to 43 per cent. This is\r\nstill a very high number, and we are looking into all sorts\r\nof methods of increasing private sector investment to\r\nincrease private sector employment.\r\nBut population growth also has a negative impact on\r\nour local environment. There is a growing trend of\r\nmigration to the two main urban centres of the Marshall\r\nIslands — Majuro, the capital, and Ebeye, close to the\r\nUnited States base at Kwajalein. These areas are\r\nbecoming increasingly crowded, and there is an urgent\r\nneed to find local solutions. There is a great need to\r\nimprove urban conditions, but at the same time we also\r\nwish to reduce the rate at which the urban centre\r\npopulation grows.\r\nIn a democracy like ours, it is difficult to try to\r\nimpose any restrictions; instead, we have tried to look\r\ninto incentives. One idea that has been tried is job\r\ncreation in the outer islands. We have long been aware of\r\nthe potential that the outer islands could have if there\r\nwere only more investment in sustainable development\r\nprojects.\r\nPopulation growth is causing difficulties for the\r\ncountry in many diverse fields, but Government and local\r\nauthority action is making some progress. Our youth and\r\nchurch groups in particular are taking up this issue as a\r\nmain concern for the future. But this is only one of many\r\nproblem which we have to face.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nWe have by no means given up on the struggle to\r\nachieve sustainable development and the improvement of\r\nliving standards in the Marshall Islands. On the\r\nGovernment side we are first of all looking at how existing\r\nstructures can be reformed and how better to utilize our\r\nresources. We are interested in any innovations that could\r\nhelp us. But it is increasingly clear that if we are to break\r\nout of destructive cycles and move away from\r\nunsustainable patterns, then we must all work together.\r\nThere will continue to be a need for external assistance to\r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands, but this can and must\r\nbe channelled in a more appropriate manner.\r\nLast year we reported that the damage caused by\r\nnuclear-weapons testing in the Marshall Islands was far\r\nmore extensive and devastating than previously understood.\r\nWe now know that many more islands and groups of\r\npeople were affected. The testing programme in the\r\nMarshall Islands helped the international community\r\nunderstand the effects of nuclear weapons on people and\r\nthe environment. This knowledge was a contributing factor\r\nto the prevention of nuclear war during the cold-war era. In\r\nthe Marshall Islands, we believe that we played a\r\nsignificant role in bringing about the end of the cold war.\r\nWe share the commitment of the United Nations to world\r\npeace, security and disarmament.\r\nThere is little question that the nuclear-testing\r\nprogramme in the Marshall Islands was the defining\r\nexperience of the Marshallese people in this century. The\r\n67 nuclear-weapon tests conducted in our country and the\r\ntests conducted on our neighbouring Pacific islands\r\ncontaminated every inch of our environment and exposed\r\neach one of our citizens to radiation. As a result, my\r\nGovernment is desperately seeking resources to address the\r\ndirect medical and environmental consequences of radiation\r\nexposure, since we do not have sufficient funds. We are\r\nalso struggling to deal with the indirect problems of the\r\ndisplacement of, and the lack of adequate medical care for,\r\nthe affected population. It places an additional burden on\r\nour already constrained medical care resources.\r\nWe cannot solve these problems on our own, and we\r\nfeel obliged to appeal to the international community. We\r\ncertainly appreciate all efforts to address our problems\r\nmade by our former administering authority, and we are\r\nencouraged by recent indications that the United States is\r\nwilling to address outstanding concerns. Yet present efforts\r\nto address lingering consequences are inadequate.\r\nMarshallese people have the basic human right, like all\r\npeople throughout the world, to a healthy and clean\r\nenvironment. We are justified, therefore, in asking\r\nassistance in restoring our lands and returning our\r\ndisplaced populations to a safe environment.\r\nIn this regard the United Nations has an important\r\nrole to play. We are encouraged that the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency is in the process of conducting a\r\nsurvey in the northern areas of the Marshall Islands. But\r\nanother body, the United Nations Scientific Committee on\r\nthe Effects of Atomic Radiation, could in our view have\r\na much greater role. We have noted the terms of\r\nreference of that Scientific Committee, and we see no\r\nreason why it cannot undertake studies that could in the\r\nfuture assist those populations that are suffering from the\r\neffects of atomic radiation. In our view it must go beyond\r\na simple academic understanding and have a role that\r\nwould allow more interaction with affected countries. I\r\nwas also a little puzzled by the brevity of the Scientific\r\nCommittee’s last report — only one page. We would like\r\nto request that the Committee expand its scope of work,\r\nto see how it could look into areas, like the Marshall\r\nIslands, affected by nuclear tests. We would be willing to\r\nassist the Scientific Committee in obtaining, for its\r\nconsideration, documents and declassified information\r\npertaining to nuclear testing and its effects on people. My\r\ndelegation intends to review this issue in the Fourth\r\nCommittee.\r\nMy country, all low-lying atolls, with no mountains,\r\nis also facing a most serious threat of sea level rise.\r\nWhile we are here discussing this issue, the effects of\r\nerosion, storms and tide surges are already being felt in\r\nthe Marshall Islands. We are of the firm opinion that the\r\nscientists working with the Intergovernmental Panel on\r\nClimate Change (IPCC) have by now made such a\r\nconvincing argument about this troubling issue. This\r\nconsensus has been reflected in the acceptance by all\r\nGovernments concerned of the Second Assessment Report\r\nof the IPCC. As a result of this acceptance of the\r\nscientific proof, we would have expected, at the very\r\nleast, that the developed countries would agree to\r\nundertake so-called no-regrets measures. Such measures\r\nseek to improve efficiency and reduce waste, and to\r\ndevelop alternative sources of energy. My Government\r\nfully supports such initiatives, as they seem to us to be a\r\nperfectly sensible way to begin addressing climate change.\r\nBut we are finding that there is resistance even to such a\r\nmodest idea aimed at trying to halt this irresponsible\r\nwaste of natural resources and fossil fuels. I have been\r\nhearing reports that in the negotiating process there are\r\nstill those countries that seek to undermine the process\r\nitself for their own short-term gains. I can only say that\r\nmy Government is saddened by these countries’ attitude.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nFor this reason, a Pacific regional expert group has warned\r\nthat we may have to look at our migration options, rather\r\nthan adaptation options. Are we willing to see the\r\ndisappearance of whole countries for the sake of short-term\r\neconomic gain?\r\nA recent newspaper ad campaign here in the United\r\nStates has further attempted to add confusion and doubt in\r\nregard to the scientific evidence, and is also spreading\r\nalarmist doomsday scenarios for the economies of the\r\ndeveloped countries. This is simply a misrepresentation of\r\nwhat is being discussed and of what has been proposed, as\r\nwell as what is likely to be the result if we do not act now.\r\nI was further amazed at seeing television ads stating similar\r\nmisleading information. The question that appears to be\r\nraised is that the developed countries will pay a heavy\r\nfinancial price for ineffective measures. The suggestion here\r\nis that climate change is a preposterous plot by developing\r\ncountries to dominate the industrialized economies. But\r\nclimate change would be costly to us all. The destruction of\r\nsmall island developing States and other low-lying areas\r\nwill only be the first marker as the flood gates open for\r\nfull-blown climate change. There should be no\r\nmisconception that there is any other option except action\r\nto significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I wish to\r\nstate our position, supported by scientists, economists and\r\nconcerned people, that inaction will result in a disaster for\r\nmankind. What we need as the first step are significant,\r\nlegally binding cuts in the greenhouse gas emissions of the\r\nindustrialized world.\r\nPlease allow me to state our gratitude to and full\r\nsupport for the Secretary-General in his efforts and\r\nproposals to reform the United Nations. His report has been\r\nstudied by our officials, and we have concluded that we\r\nmust give the Secretary-General our full backing on his\r\nvision for a reformed United Nations. I have some\r\nexperience with the difficulties of bringing reform to an\r\nunwilling system, and we understand fully what he is going\r\nthrough. But reform is crucial if we are to have a forward-\r\nlooking and effective United Nations, a United Nations that\r\ncan assist us developing countries in our search for\r\nsustainable development. All the national efforts of\r\ncountries like the Marshall Islands require an international\r\nsupport structure that is conducive to sustainable\r\ndevelopment goals. The United Nations has a crucial and\r\nvital role, and we must maintain its leadership and\r\ncoordination function.\r\nReform of the United Nations requires that the\r\nMember States recommit themselves to their treaty\r\nobligations to negotiate in good faith and find the mutually\r\nbeneficial steps that we need to take. I wish to reiterate\r\nthe support which my Government has given to the\r\nproposals that have come out of the Committee on\r\nContributions as a good starting point for financial\r\nreform. Let us take these modest first steps, and then in\r\nthe next phase we can finish the reform.\r\nReform will also have to involve the expansion of\r\nthe Security Council. We have stated our support for\r\nvarious proposals in past general debates, and we have\r\nbeen involved in the working groups. Last week the\r\nPrime Minister of Fiji reiterated their proposal to give\r\nmore prominence to the Pacific as a subregion of the\r\nAsian Group. This is an idea that we wholeheartedly\r\nembrace. It has captured a very important facet of the\r\nreasons why we need to have expansion — that is, to\r\nfacilitate the participation of all countries in the Security\r\nCouncil. Our countries would feel much more\r\ncomfortable with the decisions of the Security Council if\r\nwe had a better opportunity to be a member. There is also\r\na need to review the use and extent of the veto power,\r\nand whether there should in fact be any new permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. It may well be that a\r\nmore equitable rotation structure would suffice.\r\nThese are some of the most pressing issues before\r\nthis session of the General Assembly. The connection\r\nbetween what occurs in the international community and\r\nthe impact the results have on individual countries should\r\nbe made clearer. The sustainable development process\r\nthat we wish to work towards requires a great effort on\r\nthe part of the Marshall Islands Government and\r\ncitizenry.\r\nSimilarly, the international community as a whole\r\nmust be involved in charting a more democratic and\r\ncooperative future in this singular world organization. We\r\nfeel that we deserve the support of the international\r\ncommunity for our own efforts, and we pledge to work\r\nconstructively with the United Nations system and donor\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Liberia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Monie Captan, to whom I give the floor.\r\nMr. Captan (Liberia): I have the honour to present\r\nmy personal compliments to His Excellency\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko and to wish him every success\r\nduring his presidency.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nI have the honour also to deliver the address of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor, President of the\r\nRepublic of Liberia, who regrettably cannot be here today.\r\nThe text of his address reads as follows:\r\n“At the outset, I wish to convey sincere\r\ngreetings, on behalf of the Government and people of\r\nLiberia and in my own name. We are here today,\r\nhaving endured and survived a severe civil crisis of\r\nnearly a decade, through the acute consciousness of\r\nour subregion, whose empathy with Liberia’s plight\r\ncreated and orchestrated a mechanism to prevent us\r\nfrom self-destruction. And we stand no less indebted\r\nto a sea of humanitarian outreach through the\r\ninternational community, most notably the European\r\nUnion (EU) and the United States; but absolutely, as\r\na living testimony to God Almighty, whose\r\ncompassionate will has removed the hand of evil from\r\nthe activities of our nation.\r\n“Indeed, we are here because Liberia has stood\r\nthe test of time and the full assault of hardship.\r\nToday, one added voice of a sovereign State of\r\nAfrica — and an original Charter Member of this\r\nOrganization — is being heard through its constituted\r\nHead of Government, which we symbolize, and for\r\nwhich we give all glory to God.\r\n“It is my pleasure to congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election to the\r\npresidency of this fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly. To this we add our best wishes for his\r\nsuccess in meeting the challenges of this awesome\r\nassignment. Also, it is befitting that we extend our\r\nthanks to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail, whose tenure was characterized by a resolute\r\ncommitment to finding solutions to the many issues\r\nwhich impacted the proceedings of the fifty-first\r\nsession.\r\n“I wish also to seize this opportunity to\r\ncommend, on behalf of the Government and people of\r\nLiberia, Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Already, he\r\nhas demonstrated that he understands the problems\r\nwhich afflict Africa, his native continent, and that his\r\nleadership is not confined to the accomplishments\r\nwhich he earned as a son of Ghana. Day by day,\r\nglimpses of his ability as an effective spokesman for\r\nall mankind are being made clearly visible. Permit me\r\nto also pay special honour to the former Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose sense of\r\npurpose and invaluable efforts to strengthen the role of\r\nthe Organization in the pursuit of international peace\r\nand security have brought benefits to mankind. We\r\nstand convinced that the patience he exercised and\r\nthe many initiatives and the personal commitment he\r\ninjected into the search for peace and understanding\r\nduring his tenure deserve appropriate commendation\r\nby this Organization.\r\n“The establishment of the United Nations over\r\nfive decades ago marked the beginning of a new era\r\nin international relations. The adoption of its\r\nCharter, a document of pride and durability, which\r\nLiberia helped to formulate, instituted a working\r\nsystem of international cooperation. Thus, nations\r\nare resolved to eradicate the scourge of war; to\r\nstrengthen peace through justice and international\r\nlaw; to respect the equal rights of all nations —\r\nlarge and small; to promote social progress and to\r\nprotect human rights throughout the world. We wish\r\nto reaffirm our avowed faith in the United Nations,\r\nand we retain the undiminished hope that this\r\nOrganization will continue to be a veritable\r\ninstrument for the good conduct of relations among\r\nall nation States. In so asserting our firm\r\ncommitment to its ideals, we, therefore, rededicate\r\nourselves to its objectives. Indeed, from nearly every\r\nperspective, this Organization continues to cater to\r\nthe common aspirations of the international\r\ncommunity. Today, with its increased image as a\r\ncentre for harmonization, the vision of its Charter\r\nMembers has expanded across its original spectrum\r\nof engagement.\r\n“Accordingly, as one of its visionaries who\r\nactively participated in its creation, we felt it\r\npropitious that — despite our recent civil conflict\r\nand its heart-rending accounts — we be personally\r\nrepresented at this fifty-second session, not only to\r\nreaffirm our commitment to multilateralism, but also\r\nto explore new ways of transforming our hopes for\r\nsolidarity into concrete actions for peace and\r\ndevelopment; not only to make a ceremonial\r\nrepresentation, but also to add frankness to the scope\r\nof discussions for the improvement of our\r\nOrganization.\r\n“On 19 July, the eve of the sesquicentennial\r\nanniversary of our independence, the people of\r\nLiberia went to the polls and made a forthright\r\ndecision for a great new beginning for democracy,\r\nfor representative government within a constitutional\r\norder, and for peace and prosperity in the forward\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nmarch towards the twenty-first century. In that\r\nmomentous exercise, the Liberian people demonstrated\r\nonce again, as they had done throughout 150 years of\r\nsurvival, their resilience and unconquerable will to\r\novercome imponderable odds, to keep alive the flame\r\nof national independence in Africa.\r\n“Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister,\r\nat the birth of his nation defined independence as the\r\nmoment ’when an age ends, and the soul of the\r\nnation, long suppressed, finds utterance’.\r\n“Thus, when the tragic events of our national\r\nexperience in the recent past are viewed within the\r\ncontext of historical inevitability, we can safely say\r\nthat the elections of 19 July 1997 gave rise to a newly\r\nliberated soul of the Liberian nation.\r\n“It is in this light that we see the landslide\r\nvictory of 19 July 1997 as the final coming together\r\nof all of our people in a national embrace of unity to\r\ngive vibrancy to the liberated national soul. The vote\r\ntook place during the week of the solemn celebration\r\nof the 150-year anniversary of the founding of the\r\nnation. It was a vote rooted in renewed hope, which\r\nconcurs with what one writer refers to as ’idealism\r\nsuffused with a sense of ending’. The people voted to\r\nend civil war and national turbulence and to begin a\r\nnew era of peace, stability, democracy, responsible\r\ngovernment and prosperity.\r\n“We have fully grasped the message of our\r\npeople’s verdict. Upon our inauguration on 2 August\r\n1997, we set out to form a Government of inclusion.\r\nWe have also embarked on a process of national\r\nreconciliation. We have invited all Liberians,\r\nirrespective of political party affiliation, religious\r\norientation and ethnic origin, to come and join hands\r\nwith us in rebuilding our country. We have assured all\r\nthat our primary objective is to foster national unity as\r\nthe best hope for genuine peace and progress in our\r\ncountry.\r\n“We have also reaffirmed the 1986 Constitution\r\nas the Organic Law of Liberia. That Constitution\r\nguarantees and protects the fundamental rights and\r\nfreedoms of all alike. We are committed to making\r\nthat sacred document work. Our Administration will\r\nguarantee and promote the functioning of a credible\r\nand independent judiciary. We shall also protect\r\nhuman rights and freedom of the press. Above all, we\r\nshall endeavour to promote internal stability through\r\na Government of inclusion and national unity.\r\n“Our experience as a nation convinces us that\r\nthe right to self-determination is a necessary\r\nprerequisite for any people to ensure national\r\ndevelopment and to play a meaningful role in the\r\ncommunity of nations. The right to self-\r\ndetermination is not, in our view, limited to\r\nliberation from external control, but also applies to\r\nliberation from internal tyranny. It is being\r\ndemonstrated time and again that it is unhealthy for\r\nexternal support to be tied to the survival of a\r\nparticular regime rather than to the growth and\r\ndevelopment of the nation. There is no substitute for\r\nlegitimacy and good governance. Internal liberation\r\nawakens a new consciousness about peace, security,\r\nstability and conflict resolution within a society. The\r\ninstitutions of the market economy are strengthened,\r\nand the people develop greater hope for a decent and\r\nbetter standard of living.\r\n“In this connection, and based on our\r\nexperience, Liberia will continue to play the role of\r\npromoting regional peace and security, fostering\r\nnational development through regional and\r\nsubregional integration and promoting democratic\r\nvalues through institution-building.\r\n“We are aware of the significant changes which\r\nare taking place, including the increased tendency\r\ntowards political pluralism and democratization, the\r\nrise in economic growth in a number of countries\r\nand the upsurge towards market economies, as well\r\nas progress towards the liberalization and\r\nglobalization of the world economy.\r\n“The end of the cold war has resulted in a\r\nrelaxation of tension, particularly between world\r\nPowers, and improved interactions among and\r\nbetween States. My Government must nevertheless\r\nregister its grave concern that since the advent of the\r\nhistoric fiftieth anniversary of this Organization,\r\nsome regional conflicts which appeared on the verge\r\nof resolution have defied settlement. We are deeply\r\ndisturbed by ongoing conflicts in Africa, the Middle\r\nEast, Europe and Asia. Historical evidence has\r\nshown that conflicts, whether in Africa or elsewhere,\r\nwill have negative consequences, not only for the\r\ncountries directly affected, but also for their\r\nneighbours and the regions of which they are a part.\r\nLiberians know only too well the consequences of a\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nprotracted conflict and therefore urge all parties to the\r\nvarious conflicts to seek a negotiated settlement of\r\ntheir differences.\r\n“In recent times, several unfavourable\r\ndevelopments have continued to threaten international\r\npeace and security. At present, in the Middle East, the\r\nconflict between Israel and the Palestinian Authority\r\nis permeated with accusations, charges and counter-\r\ncharges, despite the signing of the Agreement of 28\r\nSeptember 1995. In spite of the fact that efforts to\r\npacify the situation are being undermined, we urge\r\nStates within the region which are taking concrete\r\nsteps, as well as the international community, to give\r\nmore attention to ensuring that the peace process\r\nremains on course.\r\n“Within our subregion, while we draw immense\r\nsatisfaction from the fact that the Liberian crisis has\r\nfinally ended and the Liberian people have achieved\r\ndurable peace and stability, we lament the reality of\r\nthe threatening situation which recently has developed\r\nin neighbouring Sierra Leone. This matter truly leaves\r\nmuch to be desired, and we cannot overemphasize the\r\nfact that it is in the best interests of Liberia and its\r\nneighbours that peace be soon established in Sierra\r\nLeone and its people reconciled.\r\n“Liberia, a member of the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) Committee of Five\r\non Sierra Leone, is committed to a peaceful,\r\nnegotiated settlement of the Sierra Leonean crisis. We\r\nare of the firm conviction that it is our responsibility\r\nto ensure security and stability within our subregion.\r\n“Notwithstanding the individual and collective\r\nefforts of African States to achieve socio-political\r\ntransformation, acts of destabilization continue to pose\r\na serious threat to these countries. That is why African\r\ncountries have intensified cooperation at the regional\r\nand subregional levels to stem this trend. We welcome\r\nthe growing cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations in the fulfilment of Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter, and the renewed\r\ncommitment to conflict resolution through preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacekeeping and peace-building.\r\n“In the economic sphere, recent conscientious\r\nefforts have resulted in the registration of positive\r\nsigns in the revitalization of the global economy. This\r\nprogressive trend has been taking place against the\r\nbackdrop of explosive growth in world trade and\r\nprivate investment flows. In the meantime,\r\ndeveloping countries have thus far contributed 70\r\nper cent of the growth in global gross domestic\r\nproduct and half of the growth in world trade.\r\nNotwithstanding this, the gap between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries continues to grow, leaving\r\nmany countries behind amidst the general positive\r\neconomic progress occurring in the world. More\r\nimportantly, official development assistance required\r\nto fill the gap in resource depletion has fallen to its\r\nlowest point in real terms during the past 23 years,\r\nthereby forcing many of the world’s poorest\r\ncountries deeply into debt, and making it virtually\r\nimpossible for them to undertake or sustain\r\neconomic reforms.\r\n“This situation has affected most developing\r\ncountries, particularly those in Africa which continue\r\nto experience the crippling impact of external debt,\r\ndeteriorating terms of trade and decline in\r\ninvestment and financial flows. While we\r\nacknowledge that the development of the African\r\ncontinent is primarily the responsibility of its people,\r\nwe hope that Africa’s development will, of\r\nnecessity, remain an area of concern to the\r\ninternational community. We commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his continuing initiatives for\r\nthe development of Africa. The Government of\r\nJapan also deserves Africa’s appreciation for helping\r\nto sensitize the international community to the need\r\nto assist African countries to overcome the negative\r\ntrends which are impacting on their economies.\r\n“Closely related to the issues of development is\r\nthat of the environment. The human impact on the\r\nenvironment has increased dramatically, with\r\nunprecedented effects on mankind. Nevertheless, we\r\nremain hopeful that the growing awareness of the\r\ndegradation of the environment and the need to\r\nreverse this trend will remain a priority on the global\r\nagenda. In this connection, my Government\r\ncommends the holding of the recent high-level\r\nmeeting convened by the United Nations to review\r\nprogress on the implementation of decisions reached\r\non Agenda 21 since the 1992 Rio Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development.\r\n“The Government of Liberia is concerned about\r\nthe alarming incidence of drug trafficking and drug\r\nabuse, which have already destroyed and continue to\r\nruin countless lives. While this unfortunate\r\ndevelopment has undermined the integrity of many\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nGovernments, we commend cooperative efforts\r\nbetween Governments that have taken bold action to\r\nprevent and eradicate drug trafficking and drug abuse.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal to\r\nmerge the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice\r\nDivision and the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme.\r\n“The Liberian Government is prepared to work\r\nvery closely with the international community in order\r\nto bring success to the international campaign that\r\nstrives to undermine the production of and trafficking\r\nin illicit drugs. We are assured in this connection that,\r\nworking in the framework of international cooperation\r\nand given our commitment, we are bound to succeed\r\nin our efforts to make our world a safer place for\r\nourselves and our children.\r\n“Regarding the restructuring of the Security\r\nCouncil, we must recall that with the founding of this\r\nOrganization we committed ourselves and succeeding\r\ngenerations to continuously preserve peace and\r\nsecurity in our world. Let us remember that peace will\r\nbe elusive in the world where social, economic and\r\npolitical rights are flouted. In this connection, and in\r\nview of the Security Council’s primary role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, its\r\nreform is of particular urgency. We note the\r\nemergence during the fifty-first session of the growing\r\nconsensus to restructure the Council so as to ensure\r\nthat it becomes more representative and democratic.\r\nThis would encourage the advent of a greater balance\r\nbetween the requirement of efficiency and that of\r\nexpansion, as well as transparency in its method of\r\nwork. Moreover, with optimum utilization of the\r\nresources of those Member States that can contribute\r\nsignificantly to peacekeeping operations, immense\r\nsuccesses will redound to the credit of this\r\nOrganization.\r\n“Due to the far-reaching implications for global\r\npeace of the Security Council’s decisions and actions,\r\nthere have been persistent demands to expand its\r\nmembership to reflect geographic balance and ensure\r\nequitable representation. Besides, of the fifteen\r\nmembers of the Council, five enjoy the veto power.\r\nThe right of veto, we believe, is against the principle\r\nof universality and leaves the fate of our world to be\r\ndecided by only a few Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\n“Accordingly, Liberia joins the call for\r\nexpanded membership of the Security Council. We\r\nalso request that, as the region with the single\r\nlargest number of Members, Africa be given two\r\npermanent seats on the Council. We further call for\r\nthe elimination of the veto power.\r\n“Liberia believes that no country or institution\r\ncan prosper if it is resistant to change — the United\r\nNations being no exception. In this connection, we\r\nagree with the Secretary-General’s decision to\r\ninstitute reforms in the administrative and\r\noperational aspects of the Organization.\r\nNotwithstanding this, we support a reform process\r\nthat does not diminish the capacity of the United\r\nNations to perform the Charter-mandated functions\r\nin the area of development, more especially to meet\r\nthe needs of developing countries. We are, therefore,\r\nheartened by the Secretary-General’s indication that\r\nsavings accrued from the exercise will be utilized to\r\nestablish an economic- and social-development\r\naccount for the sole purpose of financing\r\ndevelopment programmes launched by the United\r\nNations. We note that $200 million will be saved for\r\ndevelopment by the year 2002.\r\n“The issue of sanctions has occupied much\r\ntime and energy here over the years, and Liberia,\r\nlike other African nations and nations around the\r\nworld, has watched sanctions succeed, and fail, as a\r\nmeans of encouraging change. Sanctions’ greatest\r\ntriumph was perhaps in South Africa, where\r\ninternational sanctions isolated the racist apartheid\r\nregime and contributed to its eventual downfall.\r\n“But unfortunately, as we know, sanctions are\r\nnot always so successful. Time and again, nations\r\nsingled out for punitive sanctions have been able to\r\ncircumvent the edicts of this world body and obtain\r\nthe goods or the weapons they seek. Still worse, the\r\nleaders of these nations, who are the real targets of\r\nthe political and economic pressure that sanctions\r\nare meant to deliver, often feel no pain. Sadly, it is\r\nthe innocent people — already the victims of these\r\nregimes — who suffer the most. On balance, then,\r\nour Government is sceptical about sanctions as a\r\ntool for change. Unless they are universally adopted,\r\nstrictly enforced and carefully designed to achieve\r\nspecific political goals, we believe that sanctions can\r\ntoo easily end up harming those they are designed to\r\nhelp.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\n“The Liberian civil war was to a great extent, a\r\nprotest against the blatant disregard for and violation\r\nof the rights of Liberians. At the end of seven years of\r\ncivil war, the need to consolidate peace is of the\r\nhighest priority to my Government. It is essential to\r\nnational survival and the sustenance of our newly\r\ncreated democracy that the post-war reconciliation\r\npolicy be firmly grounded in developing a culture and\r\ntradition consistent with international norms of respect\r\nfor basic human rights.\r\n“In furtherance of this objective, my Government\r\nhas initiated a process to create by law a National\r\nCommission on Human Rights that will operate\r\nindependently and that will investigate, document and\r\nreport cases of human rights violations. Additionally,\r\nthe post of Deputy Minister for Human Rights has\r\nbeen created within the Ministry of Justice, with\r\nspecific responsibility to ensure the protection of basic\r\nhuman rights.\r\n“Since its inauguration on 2 August, our\r\nGovernment has taken prompt and appropriate steps\r\nthat will protect the rights of all people, whether\r\ncitizens or aliens, residing in the country. As a\r\ntestimony to this commitment, some immigration\r\nofficers were dismissed when they were found guilty\r\nof having brutalized some alleged aliens. Additionally,\r\na private lawyer successfully filed a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus against the Minister of Justice, the\r\nCommissioner of Immigration and the Director of\r\nPolice for detaining a number of aliens for over forty-\r\neight hours without the formal charge required. The\r\nlawyer won the case and the aliens were released.\r\n“Without a doubt, we as a Government are aware\r\nthat we are being keenly observed, as if through a\r\nmicroscope, both internally and externally.\r\nAccordingly, we do not intend to water down our\r\npromise that matters relating to human rights will be\r\nkept clean and our record maintained unadulterated.\r\nAs a candidate for the presidency, we made it\r\nabundantly clear that, when elected, there would be no\r\nwitch-hunting. On this account, we stand to be\r\nchallenged.\r\n“We are witnesses to the rapid growth of the\r\nglobal village through advances in technology,\r\ncommunications and tolerance, which, too, have\r\nencouraged world peace and stability. Indeed, when\r\nthe illustrious architects of this noble Organization\r\nconceived the idea, from the Dumbarton Oaks\r\nConference to the Yalta Conference, before drawing\r\nup the United Nations, the world was not as it is\r\ntoday. From its original membership of 51 nations in\r\n1945, the United Nations now has an impressive\r\nmembership of 185 nations. Out of this number, 28\r\nhave been admitted just since 1990, the latest being\r\nPalau, in 1994.\r\n“The parallel existence of the People’s\r\nRepublic of China and the Republic of China on\r\neither side of the Taiwan Strait constitutes for my\r\ncountry, a founding Member of the Organization,\r\none of the difficulties and the source of the prevalent\r\nsense of frustration that continue to persist on the\r\ninternational political scene since the end of the cold\r\nwar.\r\n“It really begs the issue to review the decision\r\nof the General Assembly on 25 October 1971, when\r\nits Members voted to admit the People’s Republic of\r\nChina to membership while ignoring a compromise\r\nproposal that the Republic of China retain a seat in\r\nthe General Assembly. My country, a life-long\r\nsupporter of the principle of including every nation\r\nin the United Nations system, feels that there should\r\nbe a re-examination of the proposal to which I have\r\njust referred, with a view to admitting the Republic\r\nof China to the General Assembly. Quite clearly,\r\nexisting global realities make it necessary and\r\nprudent for us to review the action taken in 1971.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations is the proper\r\ninstrument for the correction of many seemingly\r\nintractable problems. We would add that this\r\nOrganization is the most significant international\r\nforum for the resolution of complex crises and that\r\nall nations that desire to participate in the United\r\nNations should have that right. Yet, in the highest\r\nsense, we believe that until reunification is achieved\r\nthe parallel participation in the United Nations of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China and the Republic of\r\nChina would be conducive to regional security and\r\nworld peace.\r\n“One of the principal challenges facing Liberia\r\ntoday is the revitalization of its economy. The past\r\nprosperity of the Liberian economy was built on the\r\nsuccessful development of the country’s abundant\r\nnatural resources and the active participation of the\r\nprivate sector. We also enjoyed the benefits of a\r\nlively transit trade with our neighbours. During the\r\nyears of economic mismanagement and civil strife,\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nthe economy collapsed and the livelihood of ordinary\r\npeople was impaired.\r\n“Bringing prosperity back to the country is an\r\nenormous challenge. We are determined that the\r\nbenefits of such prosperity should reach all the people\r\nof Liberia, and not merely the privileged few. I am\r\nconvinced that the private sector has a key role to\r\nplay. The management of the economy must be\r\ntransparent and cost effective. The burden of external\r\ndebt, which we inherited, needs to be addressed. A\r\npositive relationship with the international financial\r\ninstitutions is central to the success of our\r\nreconstruction programme. We need an early infusion\r\nof financial resources on favourable terms to launch\r\nthe post-war reconstruction programmes.\r\n“Private-sector operations in rubber, timber and\r\nmining will provide jobs and earn foreign exchange\r\nfor the country. We need to create a favourable\r\nclimate for new investment. This means that the fiscal\r\nregime must be reformed and simplified and that taxes\r\nbe paid to the Government. My Government has\r\nalready implemented a programme to centralize all\r\nrevenue collection under the Ministry of Finance. Our\r\nexchange rate and currency practices are being\r\nreviewed in order to guide local and foreign investors\r\nand inform them about the transaction costs of doing\r\nbusiness.\r\n“In managing the economy we must make the\r\nbest use of scarce resources. There is no place in the\r\nnew Liberia for ineffective public corporations and a\r\nbloated civil service that are a drain on the budget.\r\nRevenue collection is being tightened up, expenditure\r\nstrictly controlled, and the budget used as the main\r\nvehicle for prudent fiscal management and public\r\naccountability. Given our very limited resources, this\r\nwill mean that many priority projects will have to\r\nwait.\r\n“Liberia’s external debt to international financial\r\ninstitutions and other external creditors, inherited from\r\nprevious Governments, imposes a huge burden on my\r\nGovernment. We believe that the size of that burden,\r\ncoupled with the cost of rebuilding a shattered society,\r\nmakes it essential that the international community\r\nmake special concessions.\r\n“My Government intends to manage public\r\nfinances in accordance with the high standards\r\nexpected of any good government. But we cannot\r\nconsolidate the transition from war to peace unless\r\nimmediate funds are available to run the machinery\r\nof government and to start up the reintegration\r\nprogrammes designed by donors, in consultation\r\nwith our Government.\r\n“I stand here in this great Hall and before\r\nhonoured representatives of independence as the\r\nrepresentative of a nation that only 75 days ago\r\nunderwent a free, fair and peaceful election —\r\nperhaps one of the most transparent elections ever\r\nheld anywhere in the world. I hail from a national\r\nheritage which, more than a century and half ago,\r\nwas born out of enslavement, servitude and racism\r\nand which progressed from thence to freedom and\r\nindependence, and my proud homeland, in its\r\nstruggle to maintain its sovereignty and\r\nindependence, lost almost half of its territory to\r\nexternal Powers. Indeed, I speak of a land of liberty\r\nthat has passed through more than its share of\r\npolitical crucibles.\r\n“We have come, but not in anger. Rather, we\r\nhave emerged from a stained past of self-inflicted\r\nsuffering, which is perhaps not the surest rationale\r\nfor qualifying. But our scars enable us to speak, with\r\nsome constraint, at nearly first hand about how we\r\nhave been able to survive and keep our dignity as a\r\nsovereign State and people. We ask that the\r\nAssembly accord us the requisite attention, while\r\nretaining the hope that the experience of conflict\r\nresolution in Liberia and the engagement of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community, in\r\ncollaboration with the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) through its\r\npeacekeeping instrument, the Economic Community\r\nof West African States Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG), which helped restore peace and\r\nharmony to Liberia, will enlighten members on\r\nfuture undertakings in the arena of civil conflict.\r\n“In all candour, if there is anything of\r\nsubstance that must be said, it is this: Let us never\r\nagain allow any form of human anguish to be left in\r\nisolation, no matter how meaningless it may appear\r\nin the eyes of controlling Powers. Should it not be\r\nunderstood that one human tear is just as painful as\r\nanother and that the entire globe is united by the\r\nsame life-generating substance?\r\n“We have come to the United Nations to\r\nadvocate international cooperation. Let us not close\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 2 October 1997\r\nour eyes to the countless failures in the achievement\r\nof our common objectives as we enter the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Let us take note of the dangers and work\r\ntogether so that reason can prevail. The economic\r\nproblems and social dangers the world faces are\r\nimmense, and we have no right to postpone solutions\r\nor open the door to conflict and instability. Strategic\r\nconfrontation dominated the best minds of this\r\ncentury. Perhaps it is now time to turn our eyes upon\r\nourselves, upon our peoples and our societies, to\r\nassess their condition, their moral needs and their\r\ncrises, and to attempt to find solutions.\r\n“To conclude, I wish to make an appeal to the\r\nheart, without distinction as to creed, dogma,\r\npolitical colour or national faction. I should like\r\neach of us to look the other in the eye and ask\r\nourselves sincerely and frankly: Is this the world our\r\nchildren deserve? Will we be satisfied when, in the\r\nnear future, the voice of history and of our blood\r\nsummons us to judgement? The United Nations\r\nsystem and the entire international community will\r\nbe judged on the basis of their response to those\r\nimportant questions.”\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n31\r\n"
