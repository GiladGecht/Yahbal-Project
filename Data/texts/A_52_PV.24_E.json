(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker is the Vice-Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Madagascar,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Herizo Razafimahaleo.\r\nBefore I give the floor to the Minister I would like to\r\napologize to him, since he was not able to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the morning session. I am very\r\ngrateful to him for agreeing to make his statement this\r\nafternoon.\r\nMr. Razafimahaleo (Madagascar): The success of a\r\nsession of our General Assembly lies heavily with its\r\nPresident, the chief catalyser and conductor of our work\r\nduring the session; with the state of affairs left by his\r\npredecessor; and, of course, with the capacity of the whole\r\nUnited Nations Organization to implement in a credible,\r\ncoherent and sustainable way the various decisions,\r\nresolutions and recommendations made by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt is therefore a pleasure for me to express to you, Sir,\r\non behalf of the Republic of Madagascar, our warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\r\npresent fifty-second session of our General Assembly.\r\nPlease be assured of our support and of our conviction that\r\nyour proven experience in international affairs is definitely\r\na major asset towards the success of your mission.\r\nWe would also like to express our gratitude to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Resale Ismaili, whose\r\ncommitment during his tenure we admired and whose\r\nwork and achievements make up a solid foundation on\r\nwhich this and upcoming sessions will build and further\r\nconstruct.\r\nLast but not least, I should like to reaffirm our\r\nstrong praise and encouragement for our Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his staff for their highly laudable work on\r\nproposed reforms of the United Nations aimed at making\r\nour Organization an even more credible and efficient\r\nbody, capable of meeting the challenge of the next\r\ncentury. It would thus be a matter of legitimate pride to\r\nrealize at the end of this process that major and positive\r\nUnited Nations reforms would have been achieved under\r\nthe tenure of a native African Secretary-General.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThere is no doubt that the question of United\r\nNations reform, which has been of concern to us more\r\nparticularly since the middle of July last and which has\r\nfigured prominently in most of the statements made\r\nduring the general debate, is not only making the fifty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly seem like a hive\r\nof feverish activity leading up to major events but also is\r\nlending it a special character that will remain in the\r\nannals of the Organization because of the importance of\r\nthe stakes for all of humankind.\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nIt is a starting point for this necessary process to find\r\nanswers to our aspirations for the future of our\r\nOrganization, following the solemn commitment made here\r\ntwo years ago by our Heads of State and Government, in\r\nthe framework of the commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, to work jointly to\r\npromote peace, development, equality, justice and\r\nunderstanding among peoples.\r\nThis reform process should reflect the changes and\r\nprofound upheavals that have taken place in the world and\r\nthat have made it necessary for our Organization to adapt\r\nitself and its structures to the new realities of the world in\r\nwhich we live — a world characterized by an upsurge in\r\nglobalization and by greater interdependence among\r\nnations. The free movement of goods, people, capital and\r\ninformation has increased. Technological progress is\r\nmaking it possible to transmit and disseminate ideas,\r\ncultures and lifestyles.\r\nSome developing countries have undergone rapid\r\neconomic growth and have become integrated into the\r\ndynamic current of the world economy. Others — and\r\nunfortunately there are far too many of them — have\r\nexperienced slow or even negative growth and have been\r\nmarginalized in the globalization process. Poverty and\r\nfamine still affect a considerable number of people. The\r\nfigures speak for themselves: at a time when some people\r\nare privileged enough to surf the Internat to do their\r\nshopping, 800 million others go hungry every day — that\r\naccording to a report of the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization at the World Food Summit last November.\r\nAnd that is to say nothing of illness, illiteracy or violence.\r\nThe basic principles that have given impetus to this\r\nprocess of renewal include good governance, sound\r\nmanagement, transparency and the democratization of\r\ninternational relations. In this respect, Madagascar cannot\r\nbut welcome this innovative approach because it is based\r\non the same values and the same ideals underlying my\r\nGovernment’s quest for social and economic progress,\r\nwhose goal is to provide a higher standard of living for the\r\nMalagasy people in conditions of greater freedom.\r\nIndeed, we in Madagascar hope to ensure that the\r\nobservance of human rights, social justice, participation by\r\nall in national development efforts, the implementation of\r\neconomic reforms and the practice of democracy do not\r\nremain mere political slogans but are put into practice. As\r\nthe representative of a Government born of a democratic\r\nchange of power seven months ago, I know what I am\r\ntalking about.\r\nAt this stage of the considerations presented by our\r\nSecretary-General, certain points are noteworthy. Among\r\nthose I would refer specifically to restructuring, financial\r\nreform and the Security Council.\r\nWith respect to restructuring, it is clear that efforts\r\nmust be made to merge agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem in order to ensure improved efficiency and better\r\ncoordination. An example would be to merge into a single\r\nunit in Geneva the Office of the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights and the Centre for Human Rights in order\r\nto strengthen complementarity in related activities of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy country believes that we must increase\r\ntransparency and create a culture of shared savings, which\r\na reform of the Centre’s administration would bring\r\nabout — this with the aim of avoiding by every possible\r\nmeans the non-observance of democracy, which is the\r\nfundamental reason for serious human rights violations\r\nthroughout the world. Likewise, humanitarian relief,\r\nwhich the United Nations continues to provide to\r\ncountries that are facing natural disasters, would become\r\nmore effective with the creation of an office for the\r\ncoordination of emergency situation efforts,\r\ncomplemented by an appropriate intervention mechanism.\r\nI take this opportunity to convey my country’s\r\ngratitude to those who did not hesitate to assist\r\nMadagascar in our efforts to deal with the locust invasion\r\nin the southern part of the island. I would mention in\r\nparticular the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the World Food Programme, the United\r\nStates Agency for International Development and the\r\nWorld Bank, as well as friendly countries — Japan,\r\nGermany, France, Norway and the United Kingdom,\r\namong others.\r\nMy delegation, which welcomes the strengthening of\r\ncertain United Nations activities and the inclusion of new\r\npriorities, agrees with the conclusions of the fifty-third\r\nsession of the Commission on Human Rights, according\r\nto which human rights are inseparable from the promotion\r\nof peace, security, economic prosperity and social equity.\r\nIt reaffirms, therefore, that the work of the United\r\nNations in the area of human rights must be considered as\r\nan element of the Organization’s activities in the field of\r\npreventive diplomacy, and that United Nations operations\r\nto monitor the observance of human rights must promote\r\nrespect for these rights in order to be able to restore\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nsocial stability and assist in the reconstruction and recovery\r\nof societies following periods of conflict.\r\nIn this regard, the restructuring of the Secretariat\r\nshould take into account all approaches to human rights, in\r\naccordance with the outcome of the Vienna Conference,\r\nwhich, as we know, proclaimed the interdependence and\r\nindivisibility of human rights as well as the promotion of\r\nthe right to development.\r\nMy delegation, however, would appeal for greater\r\nvigilance on the question of human rights, bearing in mind\r\nthat on 10 December we shall begin to celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\r\nand in view of the possible consequences of international\r\noversight of human rights for the sovereignty of States,\r\nparticularly when this involves monitoring measures and\r\neven conditionality, under the guise of humanitarian\r\nconcerns.\r\nReform must not be reduced to a simple cost-cutting\r\nexercise; rather, it must strengthen the role of the\r\nOrganization and above all enhance its efficiency. Hence\r\nMadagascar recognizes the need to strengthen the role of\r\nthe General Assembly, which we feel must remain the\r\nprimary forum for States to discuss essential issues of\r\npeace, security and development. At a time when the\r\nvirtues of democratization are preached, the General\r\nAssembly is the only body capable of guaranteeing that as\r\nmany people as possible can make their voices heard at the\r\nworld level and play an effective part in the management of\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nThe Charter could therefore be amended to give\r\ngreater power to the General Assembly, so that it might\r\nplay a bigger role alongside the Security Council,\r\nparticularly in the maintenance of peace. We therefore\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s initiative to set up a\r\nministerial commission to consider the possible changes.\r\nOn financial reform, many eminent speakers — I\r\nwould refer in particular to the Prime Minister of\r\nPakistan — have stated in this debate that one of the main\r\nweaknesses of the United Nations stems from the fact that\r\nwhile some Members are supposed to pay their assessments\r\nin full and without conditions, others delay payment,\r\nmaking it contingent on one reason or another, whether\r\nstated or not.\r\nMadagascar appeals for what I would call a code of\r\ngood conduct or financial civic-mindedness, in order to\r\nremedy this situation. We support the principle that the\r\nfinancing of the United Nations must be an integral part\r\nof the reform process. Moreover, the scale of assessments,\r\nthe key to the apportionment of expenses, must reflect the\r\ncapacity of each State to pay, as it is applied in most, if\r\nnot all world organizations, on the basis of equity, pure\r\nand simple. It is clear to us that the scale cannot be set in\r\nstone and that there should be provision for amendment\r\nwhen necessary — that is, when there is a change in a\r\ncountry’s capacity to pay.\r\nFinally, we welcome the desire of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to allocate more predictable resources to finance\r\ndevelopment, to ensure an overall increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance and to create an Office for\r\nDevelopment Financing to allocate to developing\r\ncountries what have been described as the dividends of\r\nreform.\r\nIn regard to the Security Council, it would be putting\r\nit mildly to say that its present membership no longer\r\nreflects reality. To speak of our continent alone, Africa\r\nhas the greatest number of Member States of the United\r\nNations, and yet the continent has no permanent seat on\r\nthe Security Council. Nor was the continent even\r\nconsulted or considered at the time of the first review of\r\nthe Council in 1965.\r\nMadagascar endorses the position of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and would opt for\r\nan expansion of Security Council membership based on\r\ndemocratization, transparency and equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation. An increase in number and an\r\nimprovement in the Council’s functioning and working\r\nmethods, as well as its relations with States that are not\r\nmembers of the Council, are essential in order to reflect\r\nthe present reality, and above all to allow the United\r\nNations to lend an attentive ear to the problems of the\r\npoor and less favoured countries. In addition, relations\r\nbetween the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council must be strengthened, so that decisions on\r\ninternational peace and security can take into account\r\nsocial factors.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation welcomes the decision\r\nof the sub-working group of the African Group, chaired\r\nby Egypt, which is considering the modalities for\r\nimplementing a rotation system for two permanent seats\r\nwhich could be allocated to Africa, called for in the\r\nHarare Declaration of the summit of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the OAU.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nWe feel that the veto must not be considered\r\nseparately from the question of expanding the membership\r\nof the Council. Moreover, given the principles of\r\ndemocracy supported by the international community as a\r\nwhole, it would be logical to extend the right of veto to all\r\npermanent members, or simply to abolish it.\r\nIn addition, we emphatically reaffirm that any question\r\nrelating to reform of the Security Council must be subject\r\nto a two-thirds majority vote of Member States, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Charter.\r\nAny initiative to submit a simple resolution running counter\r\nto that would be prejudicial to the Organization and to its\r\nMembers.\r\nThe 15 priority areas on which the Secretary-General\r\nhas taken action and made recommendations respond to the\r\ndemands of today’s world. My delegation is certain that the\r\nsubstantive comments and proposals of the General\r\nAssembly will help implement the initiatives taken, so that\r\nour Organization can keep pace with the demands of our\r\ntime and, above all, live up to the expectations of our\r\npeople. In any event, Madagascar, within the framework of\r\nthe regional forums to which it belongs, is considering the\r\nproposals of the Secretary-General in a spirit of\r\nconstructive dialogue and without preconceptions.\r\nHowever, I cannot speak of international peace and\r\nsecurity without expressing my concern at the slow pace of\r\nnegotiations leading to general agreement on every aspect\r\nof Security Council reform. We are concerned because,\r\ndespite the establishment of a Department for Disarmament\r\nand Arms Regulation, announced in the package of reforms,\r\nthe Council will still remain, under the Charter, the body\r\nentrusted with maintaining international peace and security.\r\nHowever, the Malagasy Government welcomes the fact that\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU with\r\nregard to peace was mentioned in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport to the fifty-second session, as well as in statements\r\nmade last Thursday at the ministerial meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council on the situation in Africa. We are pleased\r\nto note the determination of the Secretary-General to\r\nincrease this cooperation and extend it to all activities\r\nrelated to the maintenance of peace, including conflict\r\nprevention. In this area, we welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s plan to appoint a representative based in Addis\r\nAbaba. It is important here to emphasize the importance not\r\nonly of combining, but also coordinating, the efforts of the\r\nOAU — which has a central Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention Management and Resolution — with those of\r\nthe Security Council, so that we do not work at cross-\r\npurposes. Here I would like to recall that the OAU\r\nwelcomed the principle of strengthening African\r\npeacekeeping capacity, which France, the United\r\nKingdom and the United States of America have jointly\r\nproposed to assist.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the negotiations to date on\r\nnuclear disarmament measures and on limiting and\r\ngradually reducing conventional weapons and in particular\r\nanti-personnel mines. On this last point, Madagascar has\r\nvoted in favour of General Assembly resolutions on a\r\nmoratorium on the export of mines. We welcome the\r\nagreement drafted in Oslo on the text of a convention for\r\nthe complete elimination of anti-personnel mines, as well\r\nas Norway’s commitment to provide $100 million for\r\ndemining activities and assistance to victims.\r\nIn this respect, my country appeals to States with\r\nmilitary arsenals to continue resolutely to take measures\r\naimed at general and complete disarmament. The\r\nparticipation of all States in this process of disarmament,\r\nin cooperation with the Department for Disarmament and\r\nArms Regulation, whose establishment is part of the\r\nreform programme, will provide an invaluable\r\ncontribution to the easing of global tensions.\r\nThis international determination will also be a source\r\nof mutual assistance and cooperation in combating\r\norganized transnational crime. Transnational criminal\r\norganizations have, in fact, existed for a long time, but\r\nthe globalization of international relations with regard to\r\nthe economy, commerce, telecommunications and the\r\nrapid progress of technology, as well as the disappearance\r\nof ideological blocs, have permitted the activities of\r\ntransnational criminal organizations to expand and have\r\nincreased their power to such an extent that they are now\r\na permanent threat to the foundation and internal security\r\nof States, to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the\r\nenvironment of the planet. Today we are witnessing the\r\nemergence of new forms of transnational crime: money-\r\nlaundering or the investment of capital generated by\r\nactivities that are usually interconnected, including drug-\r\ntrafficking, corruption, traffic in weapons, terrorism,\r\ntraffic in nuclear and toxic material, traffic in protected\r\nnatural resources, traffic in human beings, removal of\r\norgans, and more.\r\nFrom this standpoint, the countries that are weakest\r\nin terms of economic, institutional, material and\r\ntechnological capacity are the most vulnerable —\r\ndeveloping countries in general and African countries in\r\nparticular — because the automatic effect of the activities\r\nof developed countries to prevent and combat organized\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\ncrime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones\r\nof expansion.\r\nWe must therefore urgently find an effective response\r\nto this threat by defining a common objective based on a\r\nunited stand and coherent action, by establishing or\r\nstrengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and\r\nknowledge, by increasing our exchange of information and,\r\nabove all, by actively promoting and supporting cooperation\r\nwith international or regional forums so as to provide\r\ninstitutional technical assistance and logistical support. That\r\nnotwithstanding, we note the special importance attributed\r\nby the Secretary-General to the need to improve the\r\ncapacity of the system to combat drug-trafficking and\r\nterrorism.\r\nPeace is, with development, one of the main missions\r\nof the United Nations. My country reaffirms its unwavering\r\ncommitment to the principle of settling disputes peacefully.\r\nIt is deeply concerned by the threats to destabilize peace in\r\nthe world, especially in Africa.\r\nWith regard to the Republic of Congo, therefore,\r\nMadagascar appeals to the parties to develop a dialogue\r\naimed at a definitive ceasefire, in accordance with the spirit\r\nof the Libreville Summit, held on 14 and 15 September\r\n1997, and at allowing the deployment, under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), of the international intervention force\r\nrecommended at the Summit.\r\nAs for the internal crisis in the Comoros, which is an\r\nimmediate neighbour of Madagascar, we support of the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General of the OAU as well as\r\nthose of the League of Arab States and the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference. Furthermore, we reaffirm our\r\nsupport of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros\r\nwith regard to sovereignty and territorial integrity. In this\r\nrespect we support the convening of an international\r\nconference to restore peace in that sister Republic, and we\r\nhave expressed the readiness of Madagascar to become\r\ninvolved in any initiatives along these lines.\r\nAlso in Africa, Madagascar welcomes the\r\nestablishment of direct talks between Morocco and the\r\nPOLISARIO Front, which recently culminated in the\r\nHouston Agreement, as a result of the mediation of James\r\nBaker. We believe this to be a major landmark on the path\r\nto the settlement of the question of Western Sahara, which\r\nhas gone on for too long.\r\nIn the Middle East, Madagascar also strongly appeals\r\nto the parties concerned to safeguard the progress\r\nachieved in the peace process. We believe that an\r\nessential element for this is for Israel to halt the\r\nestablishment of new settlements.\r\nFinally, we reaffirm our support for the concept of\r\nthe reunification of Korea and welcome the progress that\r\nis starting to appear in this regard.\r\nDuring the course of the United Nations conferences\r\non human rights, the environment, population, social\r\ndevelopment, women, etc., we succeeded in achieving\r\nimportant global commitments, and we must ensure the\r\nfollow-up. We have achieved an international consensus\r\non the need to ensure that ecological realities and\r\npriorities for environmental policies are taken into account\r\nin structural changes that are in progress in the\r\ninternational economic order. To be more specific, we\r\nmust integrate environmental factors — a precondition for\r\nsustainable development — into economic priorities. In\r\nthis regard Madagascar encourages the efforts already\r\nundertaken by international development finance\r\norganizations and by Governments. We are convinced that\r\nthe overall implementation of the provisions in the basic\r\nAgenda 21 document for rapid and specific action will\r\ncome to fruition in the recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral as contained in his programme for reform.\r\nIn conclusion, I take this opportunity to recall my\r\ncomments at the nineteenth special session of the General\r\nAssembly, on an overall review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. While reaffirming our full\r\nadherence to the principles of mutual interest and the\r\nshared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and\r\ndeveloping countries contained in the Rio Declaration,\r\nand to its general implementation, we requested, first, that\r\ndeveloped countries honour the commitments undertaken\r\nin Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national\r\nproduct to development assistance. Secondly, we\r\nrequested that the Global Environment Facility be\r\nrestructured and adequately replenished so as to facilitate\r\naccess to resources; and thirdly and above all, that,\r\nfollowing the concept of the “democracy dividend” and\r\nthe “economic adjustment and reform dividend”, an\r\n“environment dividend” should be advocated for the least\r\ndeveloped countries to enable them to protect their\r\nenvironment and thereby speed up the eradication of\r\npoverty, the main cause and consequence of\r\nenvironmental degradation.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nWe now ask whether the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme (UNEP) in its present form has the necessary\r\npower to impose sanctions or to grant dividends, or whether\r\nwe need to strengthen its mandate or create a new structure\r\nwith adequate power.\r\nFor its part, Madagascar — we cannot repeat this\r\noften enough — is proud to comply with the measures\r\nrecommended in Agenda 21. Indeed, it stands out in its\r\ncapacity as a country that is both a nature sanctuary and a\r\nnatural sanctuary, possessing treasures and specific\r\ncharacteristics that are rare, if not unique in the world, in\r\nterms of flora and fauna.\r\nWe hope that in Kyoto in December firm\r\ncommitments will be made to reduce greenhouse gas\r\nemissions, which cause global warming and thereby\r\ncontribute to the further deterioration of our environment.\r\nIt rests only with us to make this session a session of\r\nreform, as the Secretary-General wishes, or to make it a\r\nsession like so many others — one in which speakers assail\r\nus with rhetoric or at best with verbal promises that are not\r\nfollowed up with actions. Madagascar is convinced that we\r\nwill make the right choice at the right time to consolidate\r\nour ideals.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Jordan, His Excellency Mr. Fayez\r\nTarawneh.\r\nMr. Tarawneh (Jordan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to begin my statement by\r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, and the Government and\r\npeople of your friendly country on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly. I am quite confident that you will conduct the\r\nproceedings of this session efficiently and competently,\r\ngiven your renowned skill and experience in both\r\ndiplomatic and international affairs.\r\nI would also like to express our utmost appreciation\r\nand gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for his\r\nsuccessful and distinguished management of the affairs of\r\nthe fifty-first session which has just ended.\r\nIt is also my pleasure heartily to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to the\r\noffice of Secretary-General of the United Nations at the\r\nbeginning of this year. I wish him success and wish our\r\nOrganization progress and prosperity under his leadership.\r\nSince the start of the peace process in the Middle\r\nEast, Jordan has carefully upheld the purposes and terms\r\nof reference of this process, which began in Madrid in\r\n1991 with the participation of all the concerned parties.\r\nSince recovering its territory and water under the peace\r\ntreaty signed with Israel in October 1994, Jordan has\r\nmaintained its pivotal role in the process and continued its\r\nefforts with the other parties to achieve the desired goals\r\nof establishing a just, comprehensive and lasting peace\r\nwhich will be accepted, preserved and protected by future\r\ngenerations. We fully believe that the durability of peace\r\nis closely tied to the need for it to be just and\r\ncomprehensive. We understand comprehensiveness in its\r\nbroadest sense, namely, all parties to the conflict without\r\nexception must be involved and all aspects of the conflict\r\nmust be dealt with, whether its inherent causes or those\r\nwhich have evolved and been aggravated over the years\r\nand during the various phases of the conflict.\r\nJordan has always emphasized its adherence to\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, particularly resolutions 242\r\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), as the basic terms of\r\nreference for the peace process, in addition to the\r\nprinciple of handing back occupied Arab territory in\r\nreturn for peace. Based on this and on relevant United\r\nNations resolutions, legitimacy and justice, we call for the\r\nresumption of negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track and\r\nthe Lebanese-Israeli track. We have also made and\r\ncontinue to make our best efforts to achieve the\r\nimplementation of the transitional phase agreements and\r\ngo on to the final status negotiations on the Palestinian\r\ntrack. We do this out of our firm conviction that the\r\npeace process will not attain comprehensiveness nor\r\njustice unless the Israelis and Palestinians arrive at a just\r\nsolution for the question of Palestine, including the right\r\nof self-determination for the Palestinian people and the\r\nestablishment of their independent State on their national\r\nterritory.\r\nJerusalem, the city of peace, which is the seat of the\r\nHoly Places of the three heavenly religions, and to which\r\nthe hearts of believers the world over turn, deserves our\r\nutmost attention, with a view to reaching a satisfactory\r\nsolution that ensures to all freedom of access to the Holy\r\nPlaces, preserves the holy character of the city and keeps\r\nit as a symbol of peace among peoples across the world.\r\nWe affirm that East Jerusalem is an occupied Palestinian\r\nArab city to which Security Council resolution 242 (1967)\r\napplies, as it applies to all occupied Arab territories.\r\nIf the security problem is a major obstacle to peace,\r\nconfidence-building and peacemaking are the best means\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nto achieve individual and regional security as well as\r\nstability in the Middle East. There is no peace without\r\nsecurity and no security without peace.\r\nAccordingly, we would like from this international\r\nrostrum to call upon Israel — the State with which we have\r\nconcluded a peace treaty — to do everything possible to\r\nbuild and consolidate confidence with the peoples of the\r\nregion in general and the Palestinian people in particular. A\r\nfirst step toward that would be to abandon, in its dealing\r\nwith security matters, the language of force, the language\r\nof siege and restrictions on the livelihood of the Palestinian\r\npeople. At the same time, Israel must abide by the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention by abandoning the settlement policy\r\nand the policy of creating a new fait accompli on\r\nPalestinian territory, including its attempts to change the\r\ndemographic structure and the religious, historical and\r\ncultural character of the occupied territories, including\r\nJerusalem. We also call upon Israel to implement the\r\nagreements concluded with the Palestinian side in letter and\r\nspirit as soon as possible, for delay and siege will create a\r\nstate of despair in which it becomes impossible to control\r\nextremism and prevent it from wreaking havoc on security\r\nand stability. Extremism undoubtedly finds in these policies\r\na fertile ground for the achievement of its anti-peace\r\nobjectives.\r\nOn the other hand, in order to build confidence with\r\nthe Governments and peoples of the region, Israel has to\r\nabandon the production and development of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. All the\r\nMiddle East States, except Israel, have become parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT). The whole world recognizes that the current\r\nsituation in the region is indeed a unique situation\r\nunparalleled in other regions of the world. A single State\r\nhas a monopoly of nuclear capabilities, while the other\r\nStates of the region are bound by treaties and international\r\nlaw.\r\nBecause the presence of nuclear weapons is a major\r\nobstacle preventing the peace process from reaching its\r\ngoals, the ideal solution for this problem would be to\r\nremove this obstacle by establishing in the Middle East a\r\nzone free from all weapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn this context, permit me to announce the decision of\r\nthe Government of Jordan to accede to the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\r\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\r\nThis decision was motivated by Jordan’s belief that\r\nweapons, including all weapons of mass destruction, do not\r\nestablish security nor restore stability to the Middle East\r\nregion or to any region in the world unless there is full\r\nconfidence among its Governments and peoples.\r\nThe Iraqis no longer see any ray of hope of ending\r\ntheir continuous suffering caused by the embargo that has\r\nbeen imposed on them for the last seven years. Iraqis\r\nhave suffered enough and tasted enough bitter pain. It is\r\nhigh time that our international Organization moved to\r\nalleviate their suffering and dress their wounds, so that\r\nthey may recover their livelihood and contribute anew to\r\nthe development and prosperity of the region.\r\nIn issuing this serious and sincere call for the lifting\r\nof the embargo imposed on the people of Iraq, we would\r\nlike to reaffirm that it is necessary to preserve Iraq’s\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We also call upon the\r\nIraqi Government fully to implement all Security Council\r\nresolutions and to do its best to reach a solution for the\r\nproblem of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons, to\r\npave the way for the reestablishment of normal and\r\nfriendly relations among the States of the region on the\r\nbasis of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of all States.\r\nJust as the Iraqi people are suffering from the\r\nblockade, so are the Libyan people. Since the sanctions\r\nwere imposed on Libya, the Libyan people have been\r\nsuffering from a ban on flights. We therefore call for a\r\npeaceful settlement of the problem arising from the\r\nLockerbie tragedy within a framework of international\r\nlaw and legitimacy.\r\nWe call upon Iran to enter into serious negotiations\r\nwith the sisterly United Arab Emirates in order to reach\r\na peaceful solution, ensuring the return of the three\r\noccupied islands, Abu Musa and the Greater and the\r\nLesser Tunb, to the United Arab Emirates, which would\r\neffectively contribute to the establishment of peace,\r\nsecurity and stability in the Gulf region.\r\nSince war began in the former Yugoslavia, Jordan\r\nhas joined its voice to those of all the States that called\r\nfor an end to the suffering of the people of the nascent\r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, suffering that\r\nshocked the conscience of the whole world and moved\r\nthe international community, which had held high hopes\r\nfollowing the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement.\r\nWe now reaffirm that peace, security and stability in\r\nBosnia — and, indeed, throughout the Balkans — depend\r\nlargely on the full and honest implementation of that\r\nAgreement. A strong international commitment is also\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nessential for making the peace process an irreversible\r\nreality. The international community must do what is\r\nincumbent upon it in this regard, including providing\r\neffective assistance for reconstruction in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and ensuring the effective management of\r\npublic enterprises as provided in the Dayton Agreement.\r\nThis would have an important impact on the preservation of\r\nBosnia’s unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nThe problem of Palestinian refugees, the resolution of\r\nwhich has been left to the final status negotiations, is one\r\nof the most intricate problems faced by the Middle East\r\nregion. However, the international community, regrettably,\r\ndoes not accord this problem the attention that it deserves.\r\nThe financial crisis which grips the United Nations Relief\r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\r\n(UNRWA) has been escalating year after year without a\r\nsolution being found. UNRWA has been forced this year to\r\nannounce austerity measures entailing a large reduction in\r\nservices offered to the Palestinian refugees, including the\r\nimmediate cessation of the scholarships funded from the\r\nregular budget; the elimination of all medical compensation\r\nand referral to hospitals during the last two months of this\r\nyear; the freezing of emergency cash assistance and shelter\r\nrehabilitation from the regular budget; a freeze on the\r\ncreation of new posts, international as well as local; the\r\nsuspension of recruitment of international staff; the\r\nsuspension of appointments to local posts, with the\r\nexception of those considered essential for the continuation\r\nof operations; and a plan to consider collecting fees from\r\nstudents in UNRWA’s areas of operation.\r\nAlthough all those measures have been put on hold\r\nfollowing pledges by certain donor countries during their\r\nmeeting with UNRWA and host countries, held recently in\r\nAmman, to increase their voluntary contributions by an\r\namount sufficient to cover this year’s deficit, which\r\namounts to $20 million, the danger of cutting services\r\nremains as long as no final solution has been found, taking\r\ninto consideration the need to meet the requirements of\r\nnatural population growth among refugees and inflation\r\nrates.\r\nSince the beginning of the refugee tragedy more than\r\nfive decades ago, Jordan has borne the heaviest burden of\r\nall the host countries. The number of refugees in Jordan is\r\n1.5 million, 20 per cent of whom live in refugee camps\r\nserviced by UNRWA and the rest of whom are scattered\r\nthroughout Jordanian cities and villages. Out of its sense of\r\nhumanitarian responsibility, the Government of Jordan has\r\nprovided all services needed by the refugees, including\r\ninfrastructure, education, health and welfare services and\r\nfinancial support, in addition to public security and civil\r\ndefence services. Thus, Jordan, despite its scarce\r\nresources and limited means, spends approximately $340\r\nmillion annually on services provided to refugees, an\r\namount almost equal to UNRWA’s total budget. That is\r\nnot all. The Government of Jordan has also developed\r\nthis year a strategic plan, a so-called social security\r\npackage designed to develop infrastructure for refugee\r\ncamps and disadvantaged areas, to provide sustainable\r\ndevelopment and to reduce poverty. The total share of\r\nrefugee camps in this plan comes to nearly $240 million,\r\nwhich will be allocated to the rehabilitation of water\r\nsystems, solid waste treatment, sewerage systems, water\r\npurification plants, road and electricity projects and the\r\nprovision of essential public services.\r\nWhile Jordan affirms that improving the standards of\r\nliving for the Palestinian refugees does not diminish their\r\npolitical right to return and compensation, as provided for\r\nin General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948, it\r\nreaffirms that the support of UNRWA is a collective\r\nresponsibility of the international community. It also\r\nstresses the legal, political and humanitarian dimensions\r\nof the refugee question and considers that any failure to\r\ndischarge the humanitarian responsibility for this question\r\nwould negatively reflect on political responsibility.\r\nMy country therefore affirms from this rostrum the\r\nneed to take serious and sincere action and to make every\r\neffort to continue the services provided by UNRWA to\r\nPalestinian refugees until a lasting, just and\r\ncomprehensive solution to their problem is reached. We\r\nalso call for the abandonment of any attempts to abolish\r\nUNRWA, suspend its operations, reduce the services it\r\nprovides to refugees or turn its mandates and\r\nresponsibilities over to any other agency, for that would\r\nhave a negative impact on the political and legal\r\ndimensions of the refugee question. It would also have a\r\nnegative impact on the peace process and stability in the\r\nregion.\r\nWe call for compliance with the letter and spirit of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948 on the\r\nquestion of refugees, as well as with Security Council\r\nresolution 237 (1967), which calls for facilitation of the\r\nreturn of displaced persons. We call upon donor countries\r\nto fulfil their commitments to UNRWA and increase their\r\ncontributions to an extent commensurate with the natural\r\nincrease in the numbers of refugees. We also call upon\r\nthe international community in general, and potential\r\ndonors in particular, to give due attention to this matter.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nThe refugee problem reminds us of international\r\nhumanitarian law in general and the need for its full\r\napplication in particular. This subject has always been one\r\nof interest to Jordan. Since 1981, Jordan has been\r\nsubmitting a draft resolution to the Third Committee\r\nentitled, “A new international humanitarian order”, which\r\ncalls for respect for the full application of international\r\nhumanitarian law. My Government has also amended\r\nJordanian laws to give priority and immense importance to\r\nthe application of this law. I would recall here the appeal\r\nby His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Jordan to work\r\nhard with the international community to bring into\r\nexistence a new international humanitarian order.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General entitled,\r\n“Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform”,\r\nwhich he submitted last July, constitutes a good basis for\r\nthe reform process and a studied plan for the future,\r\nembodying a serious and real desire for change for the\r\nbetter.\r\nThe report reviews the main strategic functions of the\r\nOrganization and provides for each of them specific\r\nproposals charting the way and making Member States real\r\npartners in achieving an Organization better prepared to\r\ndeal with humanitarian and political crises; based on greater\r\nefficiency; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas\r\nspecified by the Charter; and made imperative by the\r\nchanging security, economic, social and political\r\ncircumstances of this world. Jordan calls for opening\r\nmembership of the United Nations to all peace-loving\r\nStates, in accordance with Article 4 (1) of the Charter, in\r\norder to achieve the universality of the Charter.\r\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, while fully\r\nappreciating the good efforts of the Secretary-General in\r\npreparing his plan, stresses the fact that the purpose of\r\nreform is not confined to cutting costs or dealing with\r\nunwieldiness. It goes far beyond that to reactivate the role\r\nof the Organization to discharge its responsibilities and\r\ncarry out its functions with a high degree of efficiency,\r\ntransparency and credibility. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that reform is not an isolated event, but a\r\ncontinuing process that does not stop at the implementation\r\nof the proposals contained in the report. It extends to\r\nencompassing the general direction in which the\r\nOrganization will evolve as a result of the implementation\r\nof the proposals.\r\nThe coming century will witness deeper and quicker\r\nglobal changes. The United Nations must be prepared to\r\ndeal with these changes in the five major areas\r\ncorresponding to the main mandates of the United\r\nNations: peace and security, economic and social affairs,\r\ndevelopment cooperation, humanitarian affairs and human\r\nrights.\r\nIn the area of international peace and security, we\r\nfind that the multiplicity and diversity of armed conflicts\r\nin the post-cold-war era have made the Security Council\r\na hub of international efforts to establish peace and\r\nsecurity throughout the world. This makes it very\r\nimportant to restructure and reform the Council. The\r\nSecurity Council, established after the Second World War,\r\ndoes not reflect the balance of power prevalent in today’s\r\nworld. It has become necessary to review its structure and\r\nrules of procedure. The Working Group on the\r\nrestructuring and reform of the Security Council has made\r\ntireless efforts over the past few years to achieve this\r\npurpose.\r\nThere are many useful and feasible concepts that\r\nhave appeared in the context of reform. What has been\r\nlacking so far is the collective political will to translate\r\nthese concepts into reality. In this regard, Jordan feels that\r\nany new restructuring of the Security Council must take\r\ninto account the representation of the developing countries\r\nthroughout the globe. We feel that the Arab Group, in\r\nview of its major and effective role, is entitled to a\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council.\r\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations will continue to be one of the\r\nmost important activities of the Organization in enhancing\r\ninternational peace and security. Driven by its belief in\r\nthis noble aim, Jordan has, on the direction of its\r\nHashemite leadership, participated for many years in these\r\nactivities to the extent that, at one point, its contribution\r\nranked second among all the troop-contributing countries.\r\nI must, however, point to the financial difficulties\r\nfaced by some troop-contributing States, including Jordan,\r\nas a result of the financial crisis gripping the\r\nOrganization, because reimbursements have not been\r\nmade in a timely manner. I appeal from this rostrum to\r\nall Member States to pay their assessed contributions to\r\nthe Organization without condition, in full and on time.\r\nMoreover, Jordan has participated in the United\r\nNations stand-by arrangements. It was the first country to\r\nsign a memorandum of understanding with the United\r\nNations under this system. It also participated effectively\r\nin crystallizing the idea of establishing a rapidly\r\ndeployable mission headquarters to contribute to\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nenhancing the Organization’s ability to respond rapidly to\r\ncrises as they occur.\r\nAs for disarmament and arms control, the progress\r\nwitnessed by the world during the past few years is really\r\nencouraging. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons has been extended indefinitely and is now\r\napproaching universality. Last year, the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was concluded, in addition to\r\nother significant achievements in the reduction of the\r\nnuclear-weapon arsenals of the United States and the\r\nRussian Federation. All eyes are now set on the Conference\r\non Disarmament in the hopes of seeing it crown its\r\nachievements with a treaty banning the production of\r\nfissionable materials used in the manufacture of nuclear\r\nweapons and another providing full security assurances to\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use\r\nof nuclear weapons.\r\nSince development in the economic and social fields\r\nis one of the primary objectives of the United Nations,\r\nserious attention must be directed towards reform of United\r\nNations organs functioning in these two spheres, foremost\r\namong them the Economic and Social Council. This reform\r\nshould enhance international cooperation in setting forth\r\neffective national policies aimed at advancing growth in all\r\nMember States with no exceptions.\r\nThe most important characteristics of the world\r\neconomy, as we stand on the threshold of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, are two: first is the global transition to market\r\neconomy, and second is the rapid technical development of\r\ncommunication and information technology, making\r\nknowledge the most important factor of production. The\r\nnew world economy is also characterized by intense\r\ncompetitiveness, speed, the intensive use of information and\r\nincreasing globalization.\r\nWe must, however, consider how we can find the\r\nmeans to avoid the negative effects of globalization,\r\nrepresented by the marginalization of some developing\r\ncountries, because of their declining exports and an increase\r\nin their external indebtedness, and of social groups in these\r\ncountries as a result of the inequitable distribution of\r\nincome. Globalization is not concerned with the problems\r\nof distribution, but with being a prime mover of economic\r\ngrowth in general.\r\nIn view of this situation, the industrialized countries\r\nare called upon to increase their official development\r\nassistance to the developing world, to find comprehensive\r\nsolutions to the problem of external indebtedness, to\r\nintegrate the developing countries into the world’s free-\r\ntrade system and to improve these countries’ terms of\r\ntrade.\r\nJordan, as a developing country, has suffered\r\neconomic problems since the end of the 1980s, which\r\nwere aggravated by the Gulf crisis and the Gulf War early\r\nin this decade. By pursuing structural adjustment policies,\r\nhowever, with the assistance of the International Monetary\r\nFund, Jordan was able to achieve very good results that\r\nexceeded expectations. The budget deficit was\r\nsubstantially reduced, as was the size of external debt. All\r\nmacroeconomic indicators have improved.\r\nSubstantial progress has been achieved in the area of\r\nprivatization and the reform of internal financial\r\nregulations and the banking sector, which gave the private\r\nsector a chance to participate effectively. Jordan has gone\r\nahead on the way to development. It has initialled a\r\npartnership agreement with Europe and is now taking the\r\npreparatory measures needed to join the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO). To that end, we are doing our best\r\nto adjust our economy and prepare it for full integration\r\nin the global free-trade system.\r\nIn association with our Arab brethren and other\r\ncountries in the Middle East, we are making tremendous\r\nefforts to widen the area of cooperation, trade and\r\ninvestment in the region. We have succeeded in attracting\r\nsubstantial investments in the stock exchange and other\r\nindustrial and tourist projects. The Government of Jordan\r\nis working hard to remove the remaining restrictions\r\nwhich limited the inflow of regional and global\r\ninvestments, including lifting all restrictions on foreign\r\ncurrencies.\r\nThe world recognizes the historical responsibility\r\nthat we assume towards future generations to preserve a\r\nsound global environment, in compliance with the\r\nprinciples adopted by the Earth Summit. In spite of its\r\nscarce resources, Jordan is committed to applying the Rio\r\nprinciples and is working hard to make its contribution as\r\na partner with other countries of the world in sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAlthough we are committed, as a developing\r\ncountry, to doing what is required of us by virtue of this\r\npartnership, we, along with other developing countries,\r\nhave noticed regression and procrastination by developed\r\ncountries in discharging their obligations under this\r\npartnership. We have also felt that the nineteenth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly was held to consecrate\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nthis regression in the discharge of obligations, rather than\r\nto enhance them and to cooperate in carrying out those not\r\nyet implemented.\r\nIn conclusion, if the establishment of peace, security\r\nand stability in this world is one of the noble purposes of\r\nour international Organization, we must provide the solid\r\nground for that, which is to reduce poverty, control\r\ndiseases, illiteracy and unemployment and work towards the\r\ncreation of a clean environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment for future generations.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Maldives, His Excellency Mr. Fathulla\r\nJameel.\r\nMr. Jameel (Maldives): First of all, Sir, let me\r\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly. Your election\r\nis a reflection of the confidence and the hope that this body\r\nhas in your abilities to guide this session to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy delegation’s profound gratitude and appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, for the exemplary\r\nmanner in which he carried out his responsibilities and\r\nsteered the work of the General Assembly during his term\r\nas President.\r\nIt is also my privilege to take this opportunity to\r\nextend, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf,\r\na very warm welcome to the new Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan. We have no doubt that his long\r\nexperience as an international civil servant and his vast\r\nknowledge of the United Nations system will give him all\r\nthe insights he requires for carrying out his responsibilities\r\nfairly and firmly. He deserves every assistance and support\r\nfrom all Member States of the Organization.\r\nWith great enthusiasm for capitalizing on the\r\nopportunities created by the end of the cold war, we\r\nembarked on a journey to revitalize the United Nations and\r\nto reform the way it functions, making it more effective and\r\ncapable of playing the central role it is entitled to in\r\nmaintaining the world order, and perhaps shaping a new\r\nworld order for the future.\r\nHowever, as the discussions continue, the views\r\nremain far from consensus, even on the single issue of\r\nrestructuring the Security Council, which I agree is\r\nimportant and pivotal. But at this point we should remind\r\nourselves that in our approach to reform we should be\r\ncovering the whole spectrum of political, social, economic\r\nand legal activities of the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies.\r\nIt is rather disappointing that the focus is at present\r\nmainly on the restructuring of the Security Council.\r\nFurthermore, the proposals made so far on this issue are\r\nsadly inadequate, and many suggest the creation of a new\r\nform of idiosyncrasy.\r\nIn the absence of a formula which is comprehensive\r\nand just, we may as well suggest the following.\r\nFirst, increase the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers in the Council to an appropriate level, reflecting\r\nthe growth of the membership and its present diversity.\r\nSecondly, amend paragraph 2 of Article 23 of the\r\nCharter to enable the non-permanent member States to be\r\nre-elected for any number of consecutive terms, so that\r\nthose who seek to occupy a seat in this important body on\r\na continuing basis can do so as long as they enjoy the\r\nconfidence and support of the Member States.\r\nThirdly, encourage the permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council to agree among themselves on an accord\r\nwhich will remove or at least minimize the common\r\napprehension arising from the fear of their misusing the\r\nveto power.\r\nMy delegation applauds the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to bring much needed reforms to the\r\nadministrative and financial functioning of the\r\nOrganization. The proposals that he submitted to the\r\nAssembly on 16 July 1997 deserve our careful\r\nconsideration, as they contain far-reaching and\r\nconstructive arrangements which will at least help the\r\nUnited Nations emerge from its present difficulties.\r\nThe enthusiasm which followed the end of the cold\r\nwar also provided us the opportunity to meet in several\r\ninternational conferences to deal with some of the issues\r\nof true concern to all of us. These issues include the\r\nenvironment, social development, population, women,\r\nhuman settlements and food security. At those meetings\r\nwe adopted ambitious action plans, reaching the\r\nconclusion that sustainable development should be the\r\ncore of the achievement of our objectives. Yet without the\r\ngenuine and sincere will of the international community\r\nto honour their commitments, the action plans, which bear\r\nenormous price tags, cannot be implemented effectively.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nThis stark truth dominated the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in June this year, when we noted the\r\nlack of progress in the international action called for in the\r\nhistoric Agenda 21 of the 1992 Earth Summit.\r\nThe emission of greenhouse gases is continuing\r\nunabated, polluting the environment and warming the global\r\natmosphere more and more. If the latest predictions of the\r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on\r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions and global warming were to\r\ncome true, then by the year 2100 almost 80 per cent of the\r\nlow-lying island countries, including my own, would be\r\nsubmerged in the sea.\r\nFor the Maldives and other small island developing\r\nStates, which are most affected by the degradation of the\r\nworld’s environment, the lack of progress in international\r\naction is most lamentable. We are not only fearful of an\r\nimpending danger, we are also anxious that unless the\r\nworld acts now and swiftly, it may be too late for us to\r\navoid environmental catastrophe.\r\nIf we care to halt and reverse this lurking threat, we\r\nneed the unwavering commitment and cooperation of the\r\nentire international community. And there is nothing we can\r\ndo on our own.\r\nEver since my President, Mr. Maumoon Abdul\r\nGayoom, apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impending\r\nenvironmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to our\r\ncountry, the Maldives has been warning vigorously, at\r\nnational, regional and international levels, of this problem.\r\nToday I am happy to state that at the national level we\r\nare continuing successfully to create environmental\r\nawareness by involving non-governmental organizations and\r\nthe private sector. We have also successfully implemented\r\na few projects to protect and preserve the environment. For\r\ninstance, under the two-million-tree national programme the\r\npeople of the Maldives have planted eight trees per person\r\nin the last two years. I wonder what a spectacular impact\r\nwe could have on our planet if we could plant eight trees\r\nper person in the entire world over the next two years.\r\nAt the regional level, the Delhi Declaration of the\r\nEnvironment Ministers of the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) stands as testimony to our\r\nregional efforts. The Declaration, which reflected the\r\ncommon position of our region on global environmental\r\nissues, was presented to this Assembly by President\r\nGayoom at its nineteenth special session. Another important\r\nmeeting of SAARC environment ministers is scheduled to\r\nbe held this month in the Maldives.\r\nAt the international level, we are working closely\r\nwith the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) to\r\npursue our cause. We attach the utmost importance to the\r\nswift and steady implementation of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States, and once again we call\r\nupon the developed countries to fulfil their commitments\r\nand pledges of support.\r\nIn this connection, we call upon the industrialized\r\ncountries to follow the examples set by the United\r\nKingdom and the European Union during the nineteenth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly and to commit\r\nthemselves to legally binding and meaningful targets to\r\nreduce their greenhouse-gas emission levels.\r\nFor the Maldives, a country that will be affected\r\nseverely, if not fatally, by climate change, it is hard to\r\naccept a target below the 20 per cent reduction level by\r\nthe year 2005, as contained in the AOSIS protocol, as a\r\nmeaningful reduction.\r\nLast month the Maldives hosted the thirteenth\r\nsession of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic\r\nChange, which was regarded not only as a very important\r\nmeeting on the subject, but also a very timely one, as the\r\nworld is looking forward eagerly and with great optimism\r\nto the forthcoming third session of the Conference of the\r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change in Kyoto.\r\nMy country and many other small States in the\r\ndeveloping world, especially those among the least\r\ndeveloped countries, have placed our trust in the United\r\nNations to help us face and overcome the inherent\r\nconstraints we have as we continue our quest towards\r\nprogress and prosperity. We also look to the United\r\nNations to develop policies and take effective measures to\r\nprotect us from threats, whether economic or political,\r\nand alleviate our sufferings from environmental\r\ncalamities. The fact is that we cannot on our own face the\r\nodds and that our economies are more vulnerable than\r\nthose of larger and more prosperous States. Protection of\r\nthe weaker should not be seen as a burden, but rather as\r\na shared responsibility of all, recognizing the realities of\r\nour diversified membership in this Organization.\r\nWhile liberalization of the world economy may have\r\nboosted the prospects for some of the developing\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\ncountries to successfully integrate themselves into the new\r\ninternational trading arrangements, those with little access\r\nto the world market, capital and new technologies find\r\nthemselves becoming marginalized, away from the\r\nmainstream of the world economy.\r\nThe gap between the rich and the poor is continuing\r\nto grow unabated. Several developing countries, and\r\nparticularly the least developed of them, still continue to\r\nsuffer from endemic poverty, which is compounded by the\r\nsevere debt burden and leads to political and economic\r\ndislocation.\r\nThe overall decline in official development assistance\r\nover the years has aggravated the conditions of the least\r\ndeveloped countries. Unless the developed countries fulfil\r\ntheir commitment to reach the United Nations accepted\r\ntarget of dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national product\r\nto official development assistance and intensify their efforts\r\nto reverse the present downward trend, hopes for the least\r\ndeveloped countries will remain as grim as ever.\r\nThe Committee for Development Planning, at its\r\nthirty-first session, held in May this year, proposed in its\r\nreport that the Maldives be graduated from the least\r\ndeveloped countries list at the time of the next review in\r\nthe year 2000, if we continue to prosper at the present rate.\r\nWe are overwhelmed to see our development efforts\r\nbeing rewarded with a decision of expulsion. Over the\r\nyears, my country has successfully cleared numerous\r\nhurdles in the path of socio-economic development, despite\r\nits limited resources. We were able to improve the per\r\ncapita income, raise the standard of living of the people and\r\nprovide basic services to the community and individuals at\r\nhigher levels than many others in the least developed\r\ncountry category.\r\nThis success was in large measure due to the stable\r\npolitical climate that we enjoyed, which in turn provided us\r\nthe opportunity to implement carefully planned, action-\r\noriented policies and strategies. At the same time, we could\r\nnot have achieved these happy results without the support\r\nwe received from friendly countries and multilateral\r\norganizations.\r\nHowever, if one were to consider these few\r\nachievements against the background of an extremely\r\nfragile economy deprived of natural resources, and a high\r\ndependency on tourism and fisheries — both of which are\r\nsusceptible to global economic change and environmental\r\nand other external factors — the whole scenario could\r\neasily change from a happy and promising one to an\r\nobscure and insecure one. The vulnerability of our\r\neconomy compels us to continue to depend on external\r\nresources, to build infrastructures that we cannot build on\r\nour own and to develop our own needed human resources\r\nfor further development.\r\nFurthermore, the smallness of our countries has also\r\nmade us vulnerable to the activities of drug-trafficking,\r\nmoney-laundering, terrorism and other forms of organized\r\ncrime carried out by criminals who are looking for new\r\nterritories to operate from. We therefore need to remain\r\nclose to our development partners in a relationship of\r\ntrust, which is far beyond kindness and charity. Therefore,\r\nmy delegation would like to stress the importance of\r\ndeveloping and applying a vulnerability index for the\r\nsmall island developing States as a basic and meaningful\r\ncriterion for determining the status of least developed\r\ncountries, recalling the content and the spirit of resolution\r\n51/183.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nI cannot overemphasize the important role that the\r\nregional organizations are playing in international\r\nrelations: fostering mutual trust and understanding and\r\nopening up greater prospects for the promotion of peace,\r\nstability and socio-economic cooperation within the\r\nregion.\r\nThe activities of the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC), to which my country\r\nproudly belongs, are no exception. In fact, I am happy to\r\nstate that the ninth SAARC summit, held in the Maldives\r\nin May this year, has adopted far-reaching and bold\r\ninitiatives that will bring the countries of South Asia\r\ncloser to each other and enhance further cooperation\r\nbetween them in the economic and technical fields.\r\nAmong other important decisions, we have pledged to\r\neradicate poverty from our region as early as possible,\r\npreferably by the year 2002. We have joined hands to\r\naccelerate our efforts to achieve trade liberalization and\r\nestablish a free-trade area by the year 2001. We have\r\nalso, for the first time, decided to begin informal political\r\nconsultations in order to enhance and foster good-\r\nneighbourly relations, relieve tension and build trust and\r\nconfidence between and among Member States.\r\nThe alarming level of tension that exists on the\r\ninternational political scene is of utmost concern to us. In\r\nthe recent past, we have witnessed in various regions of\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nthe world the reigniting of old conflicts the emergence of\r\nnew and serious ones that possess the intensity to stretch\r\nthe United Nations to its limits.\r\nThe dangerous developments unfolding in the region\r\nof the Middle East have brought into question once again\r\nthe credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations. The\r\npresent Israeli Government’s arrogance towards and utter\r\ndisregard for United Nations resolutions and the agreements\r\nthat they themselves reached with the Palestinians under the\r\nOslo accords have shattered the little hope that the people\r\nof Israel, Palestine and the international community at large\r\nhad for a lasting solution to this age-old conflict. Recent\r\nevents have drastically diminished the confidence that is so\r\nessential for the success of the process, leaving us to\r\nwonder if peace will ever come to this region.\r\nThe General Assembly met twice in emergency\r\nsession this year to consider the issue. At those sessions,\r\nthe international community almost unanimously rallied\r\nbehind the Middle East peace process and demonstrated its\r\ngenuine and unwavering support. While my delegation fully\r\nshares the view that continued negotiations in good faith\r\nbetween the two parties is essential for a permanent\r\nsolution to the conflict, we strongly believe that the United\r\nNations also has an important and crucial role to play in the\r\npeace process. The decisions of the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council must be respected and fully\r\nimplemented without any preconditions. We call on both\r\nparties to respect the agreements reached so far and to\r\nexercise maximum restraint in resorting to activities that\r\nmay undermine the peace process.\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina may have\r\nfaded a little from the headlines of the international press,\r\nbut we must realize that our job will not be complete unless\r\nand until the perpetrators of genocide and other brutal\r\ncrimes in that country are brought to justice.\r\nIn the field of disarmament and arms control, the\r\ninternational community has achieved considerable success.\r\nThe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the adoption of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and\r\nthe entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention\r\nare testimony to this. The Maldives attaches utmost\r\nimportance to the efforts of global and regional\r\ndisarmament and arms control, and vehemently supports\r\nthem. It was in this spirit that we signed the CTBT two\r\ndays ago.\r\nContrary to our expectations, the era of peace and\r\neconomic prosperity of the post-cold-war era has so far\r\nproved elusive. Outbreaks of violence and ethnic strife in\r\nseveral parts of the world have precipitated unbelievable\r\nlevels of human suffering. Conflicts within States have\r\ncrossed national boundaries and ignited conflicts of\r\ninternational proportions. Unless the United Nations is\r\nequipped to act swiftly on such symptoms of rupture,\r\nlarge numbers of people will remain in the shadow of\r\nconflicts. We should redouble our efforts to deliver on the\r\npromise of peace, human rights, fundamental freedoms\r\nand economic prosperity contained in the Charter of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe United Nations should not be solely a political\r\nforum. It was meant to cover the wide spectrum of all\r\nhuman activities with institutions for social as well as\r\neconomic matters. The disparities vividly observed around\r\nthe world, a half century after the creation of the United\r\nNations, prove that none of the institutions has diminished\r\nin importance. They were created to remedy these\r\nimbalances among States and to contribute to justice,\r\nequality and peace. They were established to build and\r\nconsolidate a climate of cooperation, to help each other\r\non the basis of moral and ethical obligations and not\r\nmerely of charity. They were erected to help the poor —\r\nnot just some of them, while neglecting others; to help\r\nchildren — not just some of them, while neglecting\r\nothers; to consolidate human rights — not just some\r\naspects of it, while neglecting others; and to further peace\r\nand prosperity for all mankind — not just for certain\r\nsegments of humanity.\r\nIf we want the United Nations to perform the duties\r\nthat we have entrusted to it, then we should ensure that\r\nwe honour our financial obligations to it. My delegation\r\nis convinced that without a firm and sound financial\r\nfooting, even our reform efforts will be totally\r\nmeaningless.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI call on The Honourable Patteson Oti, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Oti (Solomon Islands): Eight weeks ago, the\r\npeople of Solomon Islands elected a new Parliament that\r\nbrought to office the “Alliance for Change”, a reform-\r\noriented Government committed to revitalizing the nation\r\nand its economy. Programmes to fulfil the public’s desire\r\nfor sustainable development are being designed and\r\nimplemented with professionalism, transparency,\r\naccountability and due respect for traditional values.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nThe demand for change is being heard in the villages\r\nand towns of Solomon Islands, as it is elsewhere. Change\r\nfor the better, however, is not easily achieved. It requires\r\npeople with vision and the judgment and courage to inspire\r\nproductive action. The United Nations and the General\r\nAssembly are blessed with such people. Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, in less than 10 months in office, has\r\ndemonstrated insight and a refreshing openness that is felt\r\nthroughout the Organization. His proposals to create a more\r\neffective and efficient United Nations are having a\r\nsignificant impact on our efforts here. The Solomon Islands\r\ndelegation will work to achieve the consensus his\r\nprogramme for reform needs.\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Ukraine, brings to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly more than a decade of experience at the United\r\nNations and participation in the historic political and\r\neconomic transformation of his country. In this time of\r\nchange at the United Nations, his diplomatic skills will\r\nprove indispensable.\r\nAs President of the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly, Malaysia’s Ambassador Razali Ismail provided\r\nenthusiastic leadership and challenging proposals that\r\nhelped advance the reform process. We thank him.\r\nSolomon Islands gratefully recognizes the debt owed\r\nto the people of the Secretariat, the specialized agencies,\r\nthe assistance programmes, the humanitarian and\r\npeacekeeping operations of the Organization and allies such\r\nas the International Committee of the Red Cross. Often\r\nworking under difficult and even dangerous conditions,\r\nthese men and women are heroes of our time. They will\r\ncontinue to have our full support.\r\nThe extraordinary and rapid changes with which this\r\ncentury is ending understandably fuel uncertainty and fear\r\nof the future as we participate in the transformation of the\r\nworld through international communications, commerce and\r\nlaw, as well as medicine, science and technology. Even\r\nhumankind’s successful venture into outer space draws\r\ndoubters and critics alike. During the last years of the\r\nnineteenth century, rapid scientific and technological\r\ninnovation, armed conflict and the migration of vast\r\nnumbers of people generated uncertainty and the fear of\r\ncivilization’s decline among the influential circles of\r\nEurope. Intellectuals wrote about the ongoing degeneration\r\nof humankind and envisioned cataclysmic wars.\r\nIn the twentieth century brutal local and global\r\nconflicts, the development and use of the cruellest weapons,\r\nthe attempted extermination of entire peoples and a\r\nseemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the\r\nnightmare visions of that earlier generation. We are now\r\nengaged in the difficult process of understanding and\r\ntransforming this legacy of horror into something we can\r\nuse for humankind’s benefit. In this effort the United\r\nNations is vital.\r\nSolomon Islands welcomes the adoption of the\r\nAgenda for Development and looks forward to the\r\nconclusion of the discussion of the scale of assessments\r\nand the issue of the capacity to pay. For the small\r\ndeveloping States, an effective and financially stable\r\nUnited Nations that meets the challenges of development,\r\nas well as of the Organization’s other core activities,\r\nremains critical.\r\nThe Solomon Islands Government supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s programme of reform. We have no\r\nillusions, however, that it will be easy for the Member\r\nStates to reach a consensus on its adoption. Certain\r\ncontroversial proposals face intense debate, but we are\r\nconfident that the outcome of our deliberations will\r\nbenefit all. These discussions should take place in only\r\none forum so that small delegations such as my own can\r\nfully participate.\r\nIn an ideal United Nations, the future design of the\r\nSecurity Council could be characterized as “equality of\r\nmembership, yes; the veto, no”. Political reality, however,\r\nrequires another approach. The Security Council should\r\nbe expanded, with permanent and non-permanent seats for\r\ndeveloped and developing States. Solomon Islands will\r\ngive serious consideration to permanent membership for\r\nGermany, Japan and several developing countries. Since\r\nthe present permanent members insist on retaining the\r\nveto, it must be restricted to questions relating to Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter.\r\nSolomon Islands and other States in the great\r\ncontinent of Oceania are especially sensitive to\r\nenvironmental change. Our commitment to the principles\r\nof the Rio Declaration and the objectives of Agenda 21 is\r\nreflected in Solomon Islands’ ratification of the\r\nConvention on Biological Diversity and the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We\r\nvigorously support the Alliance of Small Island States\r\ndraft protocol to the Framework Convention, and we will\r\ncontinue in the joint effort towards the achievement of a\r\nlegally binding instrument to be negotiated in Kyoto this\r\nDecember. We are moving quickly to enact legislation\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nthat will enable Solomon Islands to meet its obligations\r\nunder the Climate Change Convention.\r\nSolomon Islands, which has ratified the Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea, is committed to the adoption of a\r\nseabed mining code with strong provisions for protecting\r\nthe marine environment. In 1998 we will actively\r\nparticipate in the International Year of the Ocean.\r\nWe are committed to the international nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime. Of special concern to us is the\r\ntransport, dumping or storage of radioactive and other\r\ndangerous wastes in the Pacific region. Solomon Islands has\r\nsigned the Waigani Convention to Ban the Importation into\r\nForum Island Countries of Hazardous and Radioactive\r\nWastes and the Nouméa Convention to protect the region’s\r\nmarine and terrestrial environments. For these and similar\r\ntreaties, it is important that relevant international standards\r\nbe met by the responsible parties.\r\nSolomon Islands, which has ratified the Treaty of\r\nRarotonga, continues to support the creation of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free southern hemisphere, as well as similar zones\r\nelsewhere. We worked closely with Marshall Islands and\r\nWestern Samoa in arguing before the International Court of\r\nJustice that the use of any nuclear weapon would violate\r\ninternational and humanitarian law. Our position was\r\nlargely upheld by the landmark advisory opinion the Court\r\nhanded down last year. We were pleased to co-sponsor\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/45 M in support of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice opinion. Solomon Islands\r\ncontinues its call for the creation of a forum of non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States. The forum, committed to the\r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons, and in keeping with the\r\nCourt’s advisory opinion, would seek agreement on a\r\nunified approach to the full implementation of Article VI of\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\nand would monitor progress towards that goal.\r\nSolomon Islands, which has closely followed the\r\nOttawa process, will enthusiastically sign the treaty banning\r\nanti-personnel landmines. We thank Canada for this\r\ninitiative. Recognition must also be given to the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and several non-\r\ngovernmental organizations for their efforts.\r\nA deadly legacy of the Second World War continues\r\nto haunt the Solomon Islands. Over 100 ships laden with\r\nfuel and unexploded munitions rest on the bottom of our\r\nchannels and on land. A large number of unexploded\r\nbombs still litter our shores. The leaking fuel contaminates\r\nfish breeding grounds and affects the aquatic food chain.\r\nEstimates of the costs of clearance run to $1 billion or\r\nmore, but a thorough technical and financial assessment\r\nof the problem is required. Those countries that waged\r\nwar in the Solomon Islands have a responsibility to assist\r\nus.\r\nRecognizing the need to restructure the Solomon\r\nIslands economy, my Government is closely reviewing\r\nseveral key areas, such as public expenditure, banking and\r\nthe taxation regime. We will seek assistance from the\r\ninternational lending agencies and the developed\r\ncountries. To meet the demands of globalization, we are\r\nundertaking the expansion of investment and trade.\r\nWith 80 per cent of its population of under 400,000\r\nliving in rural settings on hundreds of islands dispersed\r\nover 1,600 kilometres of ocean, Solomon Islands is using\r\na village-centred development strategy that is democratic\r\nin origin and operation and sensitive to the cultural values\r\nof an ethnically and linguistically diverse people. My\r\nGovernment is placing increased emphasis on education\r\nand recreation for women and youth, who comprise three\r\nquarters of our population. Formal as well as informal\r\nprogrammes are being used to foster the study of\r\nagriculture, biology and other sciences, health care,\r\nappropriate technologies and the humanities. We are\r\ncommitted to upgrading the Solomon Islands College of\r\nHigher Education and transforming it into our National\r\nUniversity.\r\nThe Government is also focusing on programmes to\r\nincrease agricultural productivity through research and\r\nbetter land use. We are pursuing policies to promote\r\nlivestock development and aquaculture. Fishing remains\r\na vital industry for us, and Solomon Islands has ratified\r\nthe Agreement on the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\r\nOver half of my Government’s revenue comes from\r\nforest harvesting. Our ultimate goal is sustainable forestry.\r\nReforestation and the conservation of our preserves are\r\nnow essential elements of our environmental policy.\r\nSeeking to maximize the economic return to Solomon\r\nIslanders, we are reviewing the process of granting\r\nlicences and considering the establishment of facilities for\r\nlumber processing entirely within our country.\r\nSustainable development in the Solomon Islands\r\nrequires electrification, especially by means of solar and\r\nhydro energy. Whether to enhance rural life or to open\r\nnew industries, electrification is essential. My\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nGovernment is giving energy resource development high\r\npriority.\r\nEmbracing the purposes and principles of the Charter,\r\nSolomon Islands has on several occasions at the United\r\nNations called upon the Republic of China on Taiwan and\r\nthe People’s Republic of China to take the necessary steps\r\ntowards opening negotiations to achieve reunification. The\r\nGovernment of the Republic of China is committed to the\r\npeaceful and equitable reunification of China. Peaceful\r\nreunification is also the stated goal of the People’s Republic\r\nof China. Both parties have offered strikingly similar\r\nproposals. Yet there has been no decisive movement\r\ntowards negotiation. Delay makes them ever harder to\r\ninitiate, increases tension across the Taiwan Strait and\r\nthreatens international peace and security. Responsibility for\r\npeaceful reunification rests with the two parties and the\r\ninternational community. Bringing about and successfully\r\ncompleting negotiations will be a long and difficult process\r\nthat would be greatly assisted by the participation of the\r\nRepublic of China in the United Nations. The Republic of\r\nChina, which is fully committed to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter, has the means to be an active\r\ncontributor to the Organization’s work.\r\nRegrettably, threats have been made and actions taken\r\nagainst Solomon Islands and other Member States that have\r\nspoken on behalf of the Republic of China. Even the use of\r\nforce against us has been threatened, in violation of the\r\nCharter’s principles and the letter and spirit of numerous\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. Threats have no place at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFinally, as we enter the twenty-first century, a more\r\neffective Organization requires the participation and\r\ndedication of all sectors of civil society. Let us renew our\r\npledge to cooperate with the United Nations. It is time to\r\njoin hands in shaping the present for the benefit of future\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nnow call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guinea, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Lamime Kamara.\r\nMr. Kamara (Guinea) (interpretation from French):\r\nI extend to the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-second session the sincere congratulations of the\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Guinea on his election. At the\r\nsame time, I have the pleasant duty to transmit to him the\r\nwarmest greetings of the people and Government of Guinea\r\nand, in particular, of the President of the Republic, General\r\nLansana Conte.\r\nMr. Udovenko’s wealth of experience in multilateral\r\ndiplomacy, to which he has devoted a major part of his\r\nlife, together with his outstanding personal qualities,\r\nensures the success of our deliberations. As Vice-\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\r\nsession, and because of the long-standing and excellent\r\nrelations of friendship that link my country with his —\r\nUkraine — I assure him of the full cooperation of my\r\ndelegation.\r\nFurthermore, I should like to express the deep\r\nappreciation of my delegation for the effectiveness and\r\ncompetence shown by his predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Razali Ismail, in conducting the debates of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session.\r\nI should also like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, on the outstanding work he has\r\naccomplished since the beginning of his term, and on the\r\nsubmission on 14 July this year of his programme for\r\nreform. I should like to assure him of the confidence and\r\nsupport of the Republic of Guinea.\r\nIn addition, I wish to pay tribute to the former\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who\r\ndeserves credit for beginning consideration of the subject.\r\nSome have wished to call this fifty-second session\r\nthe Assembly of reform, and we are in agreement. The\r\ndocument (A/51/950) submitted for debate, “Renewing\r\nThe United Nations: A Programme for Reform”, has been\r\nexamined extremely carefully by my Government. We\r\nmust admit that the United Nations in its current form is\r\na long way from corresponding to the geopolitical\r\nrealities of today’s world. Since its creation 50 years ago,\r\nand in particular since 1989, the world has changed\r\ngreatly. We cannot fail to change along with it.\r\nIt is true that results in the area of peacekeeping and\r\ninternational security have been extremely positive. Many\r\nmajor treaties and conventions have been concluded,\r\nincluding the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nand the Chemical Weapons Convention. The international\r\ncommunity has also made a firm and prompt commitment\r\nto the Ottawa process on banning anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, a process in which the Republic of Guinea\r\ntook a particularly active part.\r\nWe should also welcome the implementation of\r\npeacekeeping operations in many parts of the world and,\r\nan extremely positive sign, an improvement in public\r\nadministration, increased democracy and the strengthening\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nof the ability of nations to promote human rights in the\r\ninterests of better governance.\r\nBut, in spite of this considerable progress, many\r\nimbalances remain, major challenges are still before us and\r\nthe nascent globalization is not, as a spirit of international\r\nsolidarity would demand, benefiting developing countries,\r\nwhich have tended to fall by the wayside on the road to\r\nprogress. Many countries are still labouring under the\r\nburden of debt, which is crippling their economies and\r\nthereby compromising their development efforts. In full\r\nview of the international community, thinly disguised\r\nprotectionism prevents our products from gaining access to\r\nbuoyant markets. When, taking one year with another, some\r\nof our products manage to overcome these barriers, they\r\noften succumb to prices stemming from rules that are\r\nsometimes fixed unilaterally or flouted with impunity. This\r\nis compounded by the harmful effects of the decline in\r\nofficial development assistance in spite of the Rio\r\ncommitments.\r\nSo-called small arms are proliferating on our borders\r\nand are posing serious threats to the peace, security and\r\nstability of many countries.\r\nThis short list does not nearly cover all the defects we\r\nhave to correct.\r\nCourageous and consensual reform of the United\r\nNations could help us to do away with these ills, which are\r\ncompromising, through uncertainty, the future of many\r\nnations represented here. We must reassure our peoples, not\r\njust by drafting new standard-setting instruments that are\r\nlegally binding on us all, but, above all, by taking drastic\r\naction, channelling our will and joint efforts to change the\r\nsituation on the ground.\r\nThe spirit of the Marshall Plan, which the United\r\nNations should espouse, should not die with the century\r\nthat saw its birth.\r\nFor all these reasons, the Republic of Guinea approves\r\nthe reform proposed by the Secretary-General. For all these\r\nreasons it is also deeply involved in the debate that will\r\nmake it a reality. We will not go into all the positive\r\naspects here; we will simply confine ourselves to a few\r\npoints, especially those that directly affect developing\r\ncountries.\r\nI begin with the economy, the new cornerstone of the\r\nsystem after disarmament. Several economic measures go\r\nin the right direction. We support the initiative to create a\r\nUnited Nations Development Group, an Office of\r\nDevelopment Financing and a new system for multi-year\r\npledges for development cooperation thanks to savings on\r\nadministrative expenses, the first fruits of reform.\r\nThe same applies to strengthening the role of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and promoting dialogue\r\nwith the technical ministries of our countries to give\r\nimpetus to macroeconomic policies. We also set great\r\nstore by the proclamation of the International Decade to\r\nEliminate Poverty and especially in concrete measures to\r\neradicate the evil of poverty.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea puts women and children at\r\nthe heart of its development, and welcomes the attention\r\ngiven to the promotion of women and children.\r\nIn the same vein, Guinea supports the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and the United\r\nNations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa.\r\nMy delegation supports other aspects which are\r\nequally important for the restructuring under\r\nconsideration, especially the merger of institutions in the\r\nOrganization with similar activities, such as the creation\r\nin Vienna of a single Office to combat transnational\r\ncrime, drug-trafficking and terrorism, evils we should all\r\nfight against wherever they may rear their head, and the\r\namalgamation of the Centre for Human Rights with the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nThe problem of the environment knows no\r\nboundaries. If we are not careful, this may be the greatest\r\ndanger we face, since many perils are lurking,\r\nsmouldering beneath the surface of the anarchy in this\r\nmatter. It should be the sacred duty of the international\r\ncommunity to ensure the lasting health of our planet for\r\nourselves and for future generations. This is why we\r\nwelcome the organization of a special session on the\r\nenvironment and development.\r\nWe have presented the proliferation of small arms as\r\na subject of concern to African countries. These weapons,\r\nwhich unfortunately lend themselves to all types of\r\nconflict, large or small, pose a real danger. We therefore\r\nstrongly support the idea of creating a Department for\r\nDisarmament and Arms Regulation. If it is to be fully\r\neffective, it should be given adequate resources and\r\ngenuine power to monitor the cross-border movement of\r\nthese weapons.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nWhat is true of the Organization as a whole is even\r\nmore true of the Security Council. The times we live in\r\nhave made its reform essential. Nevertheless, when we deal\r\nwith this important and delicate issue, we should avoid\r\nconfrontation between regions and different groups and try\r\nnot to resort to useless polemics. On the one hand, we\r\nshould perhaps understand that we will not be able to do\r\neverything at once, or else we will stymie the debate. Our\r\nmain goal should be significantly to change a status quo\r\nwhich we all feel has had its day. On the other hand, if we\r\nput ourselves in the shoes of those who are enjoying\r\npermanent seats and the right of veto, we should recognize\r\nthat it is difficult, even human, but not impossible, to agree\r\nto give up, without a fight, the considerable advantages won\r\nafter the war after a brave struggle.\r\nBut, once peace has been achieved, it would be\r\npointless if time were not able, after half a century, to heal\r\nthe wounds of defeat and cast out the memories of war.\r\nSecurity Council reform must be one of the major proofs of\r\na reconciliation patiently achieved. This is only one aspect\r\nof the issue.\r\nIf the desire to disarm is sincere and universally\r\nshared by all members of the international community, as\r\ndecisive progress could lead us to hope is the case, then the\r\nconcept of power should no longer be measured by a\r\ncountry’s mass destruction capabilities.\r\nAfter the cold war, the end of the arms race and of the\r\nconfrontation of ideologies, the struggle — perhaps we\r\nshould say “competition” — is shifting to other arenas,\r\nparticularly the economic arena and ensuring people’s\r\nhappiness. In the process, many countries which not long\r\nago were considered small because of the size of their\r\neconomies are outstripping nations which have seen their\r\nformer glory fade.\r\nThe formidable progress in communications has\r\ninexorably reduced distances and gulfs separating the levels\r\nof knowledge and development in the different parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nTogether, let us square up to these new realities, with\r\njustice and democracy as our point of reference but above\r\nall, with a clear view of humanity united on the basis of a\r\nfruitful and trusting partnership, ensuring progress and well-\r\nbeing for all. And let us courageously decide now on what\r\nis possible, even if it means postponing matters until the\r\nyear 2000, when we can put the finishing touches to what\r\nwe will not have done today.\r\nIn the debate this session, Africa, in its constant\r\nquest for consensus, has modest ambitions. We would\r\nconsider two permanent seats in the Security Council,\r\nwith the same rights for all, pursuant to the resolutions of\r\nthe summit in Harare, as positive results. The delegation\r\nof the Republic of Guinea will fight for this during what\r\nit hopes will be a calm and constructive debate.\r\nThe United Nations is essential for today and\r\ntomorrow. If it did not exist, we would have had to invent\r\nit.\r\nThe United Nations, as a special and irreplaceable\r\nplace for 185 States to meet, work together and cooperate,\r\nmust lay down rules of law recognized universally by all\r\nso that international relations can continue in a coherent,\r\nequitable and efficient manner.\r\nStructural reform, however perfect, cannot be fully\r\neffective without adequate financing of the Organization’s\r\noperations and, above all, of its activities.\r\nReform must necessarily be accompanied by\r\nconsistent funding. Without reducing this important aspect\r\nof the question solely to the payment of the contributions\r\nowed by many countries, the delegation of Guinea wishes\r\nto state that its reaction to the statement by the President\r\nof the country that is the largest contributor was a\r\npositive one. Nevertheless, in keeping with the principle\r\nthat the rules that have hitherto governed the Organization\r\nare still in effect, the payment of arrears by all Member\r\nStates must precede the opening of negotiations to work\r\nout a new scale of assessments satisfactory to all.\r\nWhile bearing in mind that our common destiny\r\nshould be the background to our statements before the\r\nAssembly, I would like to point out that each region and\r\nsubregion comes to this rostrum with its own pressing\r\nconcerns.\r\nThe subregion of western Africa, to which my\r\ncountry, the Republic of Guinea, belongs has been shaken\r\nby two fratricidal conflicts in Liberia and in Sierra Leone.\r\nIn Liberia, the recent democratic and transparent\r\nelections held on 19 July 1997 under the aegis of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), with the support of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the United Nations and such\r\nfriendly countries as the United States of America, the\r\nNetherlands, Denmark and France, have been crowned\r\nwith success. We welcome the Ministerial Meeting of the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nSpecial Conference on Liberia that is taking place today in\r\nthe Trusteeship Council Chamber, and we hope that it will\r\nlead to the mobilization of substantial resources for the\r\nrebuilding of that fraternal country. The consolidation of\r\npeace and stability there is at stake.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea, faithful to its policy of peace\r\nand good-neighbourliness, has worked unflaggingly for the\r\nsuccess of such efforts. For the record, it will be recalled\r\nthat this is the first time that an African subregional\r\norganization, determined to shoulder its responsibilities, has\r\nmanaged to initiate, lead and successfully carry out a\r\npeacekeeping operation.\r\nWe would also like to salute here the support being\r\ngiven by the international community to ECOWAS for the\r\nrestoration of constitutional legitimacy in Sierra Leone,\r\nwhich was the victim of a coup d’état on 25 May 1997.\r\nThe consequences of the conflicts in Liberia, which\r\nlasted for seven years, and in Sierra Leone, which has been\r\ngoing on for six years, have weighed heavily on the\r\nRepublic of Guinea. These are two neighbouring countries\r\nthat share hundreds of kilometres of frontiers with Guinea.\r\nWe have had to take in hundreds of thousands of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons. The Republic of Guinea, a\r\ncountry of 7 million inhabitants, has up to 650,000\r\nrefugees, or one tenth of its population. In taking in the\r\nrefugees it has had to pay a heavy price and make\r\nenormous sacrifices. In the border areas the environment\r\nand infrastructures have deteriorated under the demographic\r\npressure. Schools have been closed to serve as shelters for\r\nrefugees. We have also had to cope with many health\r\nproblems of all kinds.\r\nBecause of this exceptional situation the members of\r\nECOWAS, meeting at Conakry on 26 June 1997, launched\r\nan appeal for emergency assistance for the Republic of\r\nGuinea. That appeal is beginning to be heeded by many\r\ncountries and international organizations.Here we would\r\nlike to thank most warmly the People’s Republic of China,\r\nthe State of Kuwait, the United States of America, France,\r\nCanada, Qatar, Italy and the Organization of African Unity,\r\nwhich have already demonstrated their solidarity with us.\r\nI would be remiss if, out of a desire to inform the\r\nAssembly of the problems of western Africa, I failed to\r\ngive due attention to conflicts tearing other African\r\ncountries and other regions of the world asunder.\r\nWith regard to the Great Lakes region, my\r\ndelegation would encourage all initiatives to establish a\r\nclimate of peace and stability in that area.\r\nSimilarly, we would like to voice our concern at the\r\ndeterioration of the situation in the Congo. While urging\r\nthe parties to the conflict to observe the ceasefire and\r\npersevere in their efforts at negotiation, we reaffirm our\r\nsupport for the tireless efforts being made by all those of\r\ngoodwill to reach a settlement of that crisis.\r\nTurning to Western Sahara, the Republic of Guinea\r\nwelcomes the appointment of a new Personal Envoy of\r\nthe Secretary-General for Western Sahara and hopes that\r\nthe personal input of that diplomat will foster the peaceful\r\nimplementation of the United Nations settlement plan.\r\nOther parts of the world are also experiencing unrest\r\nthat threatens international peace and security. We shall\r\nconfine ourselves here to the situation in the Middle East.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea encourages the efforts being\r\nmade to find a just and lasting settlement in the Middle\r\nEast. Notwithstanding current difficulties, we must\r\npersevere. Peace, a just and equitable peace between\r\nIsrael and its Arab neighbours, is essential. Peace will\r\nremake that region in the interests of all its peoples and\r\nturn it into a magnet for all the nations of the world. The\r\nonly way to achieve that is through negotiation.\r\nIn the prevention, management and resolution of\r\nconflicts, Africa is increasingly shouldering its own\r\nresponsibilities. This new approach is in keeping with\r\ncurrent developments, and the international community\r\nshould encourage and support it.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea, which pursues a policy of\r\npeace and economic development under the leadership of\r\na man of peace and tolerance, the President of the\r\nRepublic, Brigadier General Lansana Conté, will be\r\nprepared, as in the past, to bear its share of responsibility\r\nfor solving African problems.\r\nA dark cloud always has a silver lining.\r\nIt is comforting to note that life on the African\r\ncontinent is not confined to crises and conflicts. The\r\nstruggle of African peoples to emerge from poverty has\r\nmade striking progress in recent years. The needs of\r\neconomic development have compelled all African\r\ncountries to adapt their State institutions and redirect their\r\npolicies to cope with the changes of the new era.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nToday, there are many bilateral and multilateral\r\ninitiatives to help Africa get off the ground. Most of those\r\ninitiatives draw on the lessons of the past and, happily,\r\navoid the imposition of patterns or stereotypes; they take\r\ninto account the real needs of the African people, who are\r\nincreasingly involved in the choice of development plans\r\nand programmes. Measures to convert, suspend or write off\r\ndebts are part of that process.\r\nWe face major challenges, whose diversity and\r\ncomplexity concern us and call for urgent solutions\r\ncommensurate with the expectations and aspirations of our\r\npeoples. The Republic of Guinea is confident that the\r\ncurrent session will produce decisions enabling our\r\nOrganization fully to carry out its noble mission as we\r\napproach the third millennium.\r\nI conclude on that note of hope and optimism.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nnow call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Yemen, His Excellency\r\nMr. Adbulkarim Al-Eryany.\r\nMr. Al-Eryany (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt gives me pleasure to extend to Mr. Udovenko our\r\nheartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-second session. We are\r\nconfident that his experience and wisdom will contribute to\r\nthe successful and efficient conduct of the deliberations of\r\nthe Assembly and help us achieve our desired objective.\r\nI am also pleased to address our thanks and\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail,\r\nPermanent Representative of sisterly Malaysia, for the\r\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the previous\r\nsession.\r\nI take this opportunity to express my country’s\r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\nvaluable efforts in serving the interests of the international\r\ncommunity, strengthening international peace and security\r\nand striving to attain the noble principles and objectives of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\r\nformer Secretary-General of the United Nations, for the\r\npositive and important role he played in carrying out the\r\ntasks and responsibilities of the United Nations Secretariat.\r\nIf we were to define the general trend characterizing\r\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly, we\r\nwould say it is the great attention paid to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the financial and structural reforms of\r\nthe United Nations and its related agencies. This points to\r\nthe fact that the Secretary-General’s reform proposals are\r\nof great significance and not just an ordinary matter.\r\nIndeed, they aim at preparing the Organization to usher in\r\nthe twenty-first century with more vigour and\r\ncompetence, thus enabling it to achieve the noble\r\nobjectives of the Charter.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen, in principle, supports these\r\nproposals. However, we have to underline certain basic\r\nconsiderations that should not be forgotten or overlooked\r\nunder the rubric of financial and administrative reforms\r\nof the Organization. It is first and foremost necessary to\r\nemphasize that the purpose of these reforms should be to\r\nreinforce the United Nations ability to shoulder its\r\nresponsibilities within the framework of the noble\r\nobjectives for which it was established under the Charter,\r\nwhich we all have accepted and pledged to abide by.\r\nAs a least developed country itself, the Republic of\r\nYemen expresses its concern regarding some indications\r\nin the report that the United Nations role in the field of\r\ndevelopment may be reduced and its responsibilities\r\nlimited in the field of social justice and the task of\r\nnarrowing the huge gap that separates the developing and\r\ndeveloped industrialized countries — all on the pretext\r\nthat some of these responsibilities have been shifted\r\nelsewhere.\r\nAny move in this direction is bound to encourage\r\ncertain dangerous phenomena that we have been\r\nwitnessing of late, including legal and illegal emigration\r\nfrom developing to developed countries, that could sow\r\nthe seeds of social, ethnic and cultural conflict. Any\r\ndiminishing of the United Nations role in development\r\nwill lead to an increase in the population of developing\r\ncountries, which, in the absence of such basic needs as\r\nfood, clothing and shelter, could lead to a further\r\ndeterioration of the environment.\r\nFor these reasons, we would like to confirm in the\r\nname of the Republic of Yemen that the development\r\ntasks undertaken by the United Nations and its related\r\nagencies constitute an integral part of the main objective\r\nbehind its establishment: to achieve international peace\r\nand security on this planet.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nWith regard to the question of reforming and\r\nexpanding the Security Council, which has been under\r\nmuch discussion for some time and is referred to in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, we strongly support the\r\nexpansion of the representative basis of the Council, either\r\nby accepting Japan and Germany as new permanent\r\nmembers or by increasing the number of permanent\r\nmembers through an increase in the representation of\r\ngeographic groups and by allowing each group to rotate its\r\npermanent seat among the countries of that group.\r\nWe support what has been said about the need to\r\nreduce the use of the power of veto by permanent members.\r\nIndeed, its use should be limited to matters that directly\r\naffect the highest national interests. In this way, we can\r\navoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that are\r\nirrelevant to such interests, but affect narrow regional\r\ncalculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issues\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nIt is known to all that our Organization was created in\r\n1945 to implement the principles of its Charter, which\r\nstipulates that its main task is to maintain international\r\npeace and security, settle international conflicts, protect\r\nhuman rights and the dignity of man and respect the\r\ncommitments emanating from international conventions and\r\npacts.\r\nDuring the 50-plus years of its life, this Organization\r\nhas witnessed ethnic and national wars and conflicts as well\r\nas rivalries and polarizations that have led to controversies\r\nbecause of what was then known as the cold war between\r\nthe super-Powers. No one can deny the fact, however, that\r\nthe wars that raged from Latin America in the west to the\r\nAfrican continent and even to East Asia have indeed\r\nsubsided, thanks to the undeniably worthy efforts of the\r\ninternational Organization itself and of efforts made from\r\noutside the Organization, but mostly under its umbrella.\r\nYet, one important question that threatened peace and\r\nsecurity in our region even before the creation of this\r\ninternational Organization still constitutes a looming danger\r\nto international peace and security. It is the question of\r\nPalestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict, with all its\r\ncomplexities. The international Organization has failed to\r\nsolve this question and has been forced to be a mere\r\nonlooker before the various attempts that have been made\r\nbut have yet to reach a comprehensive, durable and just\r\npeace.\r\nThe displacement of millions, the occupation of their\r\nterritories, the establishment of settlements, the confiscation\r\nof their properties, the arrest of tens of thousands of\r\nPalestinians and the violation of their most basic human\r\nrights, all of which result from the Arab-Israeli conflict,\r\nconstitute a flagrant breach of all the noble principles\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and a challenge\r\nto the resolutions of international legitimacy emanating\r\nfrom the Security Council and this Assembly.\r\nWe believe that it is the right of all people in\r\ngeneral, and of every citizen in the Middle East in\r\nparticular, to speculate about the secret behind the\r\ninability of the international community to tame a State\r\nwhose population is less than half the population of this\r\ncity in which we are meeting to adopt legitimate\r\ninternational resolutions.\r\nEven more peculiar is that, when a candle of hope\r\nflickered and lit the dark fierce night of the struggle that\r\nstarted early this decade — that is, when the world felt\r\nsome optimism following the announcement of the Oslo\r\nagreement, the signature of the Jordanian-Israeli peace\r\nagreement and the progress achieved in the talks on the\r\nSyrian track to a stage described by President Hafez Al-\r\nAssad of Syria as at times encompassing fewer points of\r\ndivergence than of convergence — after that slim beam\r\nof hope, the new Israeli Government came all of a sudden\r\nto extinguish it and decided to send the whole region\r\nback to square one: conflict and destruction.\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum of what is being\r\ncalled today the “new world order”, we are all asked, and\r\nwithout exception, to implement the harshest sanctions\r\nagainst the Iraqi people, even seven years after the\r\nwithdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Can anyone tell\r\nus which lands the Iraqis are still occupying now and why\r\nthe Iraqi people should be displaced and deprived of their\r\nmost basic legitimate rights? Is it not high time for the\r\nhumanitarian conscience of some of us, particularly the\r\npermanent member States, to be awakened and for an end\r\nto be put to the sufferings of the Iraqi people?\r\nIn accordance with its positive stand in support of\r\nthe peace process in the Middle East, which is in line\r\nwith the position of the Arab Summit Conference held in\r\nCairo in June 1996, the Republic of Yemen reiterates its\r\ncommitment to seeing the process for a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace completed as stipulated by the\r\nMadrid Conference, in the resolutions of international\r\nlegitimacy — particularly Security Council resolutions\r\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) — and in\r\nsubsequent relevant agreements and protocols, and in\r\nkeeping with the principle of land for peace.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nThis principle would ensure the complete Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian territories; the\r\nestablishment by the Palestinian people of its own\r\nindependent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital; the\r\nreturn of the Palestinian refugees; the release of prisoners;\r\nthe dismantling of the settlements built by the Israeli\r\noccupation authorities in the occupied territories in defiance\r\nof the resolutions of international legitimacy; and full\r\nwithdrawal from occupied Golan and occupied southern\r\nLebanon.\r\nFurthermore, we affirm that Israel should respect the\r\nsovereignty of brotherly Lebanon, should release the\r\nLebanese prisoners and detainees in the Israeli camps, and\r\nshould compensate Lebanon for all the damages caused by\r\nthe Israeli aggressions against its peoples and lands.\r\nSince it gained its unity and strove to consolidate the\r\ndemocratic direction it has adopted, the Republic of Yemen\r\nheld the second parliamentary elections on 27 April this\r\nyear. The elections took place in a free and fair atmosphere,\r\nas confirmed by national and international observers. These\r\nelections will have positive effects at all levels — national,\r\nregional, Arab and international — for they represent a new\r\nand advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic\r\ndirection that is based on a multi-party political system,\r\nfreedom of the press, respect for human rights, and the\r\ninstitutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State.\r\nOur people is still waging its most important and most\r\ndifficult struggles to implement the programmes set up by\r\nthe newly elected Government and approved by the elected\r\nhouse of representatives. These programmes focus on\r\npursuing reform efforts — economically, financially and\r\nadministratively — and on continuing cooperation with the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the International Bank for\r\nReconstruction and Development.\r\nIn this regard, our objectives are to correct the\r\neconomic, financial and structural imbalances; to achieve\r\nsteadiness and stability in the economy as a whole; to\r\nactivate the role of the private sector in the competitive\r\nfree-market economy; to achieve sustainable development;\r\nto foster stable environments so as to attract foreign\r\ninvestments; to upgrade the basic necessary services of\r\nsociety; and to build the new State and improve the\r\nstandards of living of all citizens.\r\nFollowing these elections and the formation of a new\r\nGovernment, Yemen has persisted in its efforts in the\r\nimplementation of the advanced stages of its economic and\r\nadministrative reform programmes. These programmes have\r\nbeen welcomed by the international financial institutions\r\nand by the Brussels conference of donor countries, which\r\npledged $1.8 billion in support of the Yemeni\r\nGovernment’s efforts over the next three years. Our\r\nthanks go to all donor Governments and organizations\r\nthat have manifested their support for and solidarity with\r\nthe Yemeni people.\r\nThe British Prime Minister Henry Palmerston is\r\nreported to have said that the foreign policy of a country\r\nis the reflection and expression of its internal policy. And\r\nsince economic and social development constitutes the\r\nbackbone of the internal policy of the Republic of Yemen,\r\nthe success or failure of the Yemeni foreign policy could\r\ntherefore be measured by its ability or inability to bring\r\nin foreign support in order to realize the main objective\r\nof its internal policy.\r\nThis leads me to say that a country such as Yemen,\r\nwhich mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its\r\ninternal policy — that is, its economic, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment — has to take into account, in seeking the\r\nfinancial and technical assistance needed to achieve the\r\nobjectives of the internal policy, certain basic\r\nconsiderations that might seem to others supplementary\r\nand not mandatory.\r\nAllow me to say in this respect that within the\r\nparameters of a foreign policy there exists a red line that\r\nshould not be violated when realizing an internal\r\nobjective. Most important among these considerations is\r\nthe need to safeguard sovereignty and not to become\r\nmortgaged to others when seeking national interests.\r\nForeign support should not be sought at the expense of\r\nthe regional and international commitments of the\r\ncountry. Correspondingly, there are also certain basic\r\nconsiderations that are unanimously recognized by the\r\ninternational community which cannot be ignored or\r\noverlooked, as this would adversely affect the interests of\r\nthat country and damage its relations with the\r\ninternational community. Included in those considerations\r\nis the need to abide by international pacts and\r\nconventions and to respect human rights.\r\nEqually, the fight against terrorism and violence in\r\nall their forms and manifestations, regardless of their\r\norigins or perpetrators and regardless of where they are\r\ncommitted, has become a basic consideration that cannot\r\nbe overlooked by any country seeking foreign assistance\r\nor even mere acceptance by the international community.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nIn a similar manner, the relation between a\r\nGovernment and its citizens has a direct and strong bearing\r\non its relations with the donor countries that are to provide\r\nassistance and support. We need not be too idealistic,\r\nhowever, for the requirements of national interest of some\r\ndonor countries have been placed above those idealistic\r\nprinciples. As a result many countries that have had\r\nextremely bad relations with their peoples have still\r\nmanaged to get a considerable amount of financial aid,\r\nalthough this occurred more during the cold war than now.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen is therefore fully committed\r\nto the consolidation of security and stability at both regional\r\nand international levels. This can best be reflected in its\r\nposition regarding its conflict with Eritrea and its\r\nendeavours to solve border problems with its neighbours in\r\na peaceful manner.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen supports the process of a\r\ncomprehensive and just peace in the Middle East and the\r\nprinciple of land for peace. But, like other Arab countries,\r\nit categorically rejects the principle of peace for peace.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen has condemned all forms of\r\nterror, be it terror committed by an individual, by a group\r\nor by a State.\r\nThese are the foundations and the principles of the\r\nforeign policy of the Republic of Yemen.\r\nAt the internal level, the relation between the\r\nGovernment and its citizens is based, as I said before, on\r\nconstitutional legitimacy; on equality among all citizens,\r\nwhether male or female; on equality in rights and\r\nobligations of men and women alike; on the freedom of\r\nindividuals and groups; on the freedom of association to\r\nparties, trade unions and civilian community organizations;\r\non freedom of the press; and on the protection of human\r\nrights.\r\nOn the basis of its deep understanding of the noble\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, the\r\nRepublic of Yemen is pursuing a foreign policy that is\r\nbased on mutual respect, positive cooperation, common\r\ninterests, rejection of violence in international relations,\r\npeaceful coexistence, maintenance of security and stability,\r\ngood neighbourliness, and consolidation of the role of\r\nYemen in attending to the needs of our nation and in\r\nstanding for the causes of righteousness, justice and peace\r\nin the world under the wise leadership of His Excellency\r\nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh.\r\nIn this regard we are satisfied with the results of our\r\nefforts to improve our relations and to cooperate with our\r\nbrothers and friends. Here we take pride in having been\r\nable to solve the border problem between our country and\r\nthe sisterly Sultanate of Oman, and to reach a final\r\nsolution acceptable to both parties. This can be an\r\nexample to be followed by brothers and neighbours in\r\nsolving border problems.\r\nThis is what we are trying to do now with our\r\nbrothers and neighbours in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\r\nWe hope that we will be able to achieve what we all are\r\nlooking for: to serve the interests and aspirations of our\r\ntwo brotherly and neighbourly peoples and to consolidate\r\nstability and peace in the region.\r\nWith the aim of reaching a peaceful solution that\r\nsafeguards legal, historical and geographic rights, the\r\nRepublic of Yemen has endeavoured to avoid escalation\r\nand to dissipate tension. It has demonstrated a sincere\r\ndesire and exerted great efforts both in dealing with the\r\nEritrean occupation of the Yemeni Greater Hanish island\r\nin the Red Sea in mid-1995 and all along in the\r\nnegotiations between the two countries. We did not rush\r\nto use force, but rather have sought to pursue all peaceful\r\nways and means. We have opted for dialogue through\r\nofficial mediation and international arbitration in order to\r\nsave our neighbouring peoples the scourge of war.\r\nWhile the Republic of Yemen expresses its solidarity\r\nwith the brotherly Somali people, the Yemeni leadership\r\nrepresented by His Excellency President Ali Abdullah\r\nSaleh has added its efforts to those of the League of Arab\r\nStates, the Organization of African Unity and the Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Drought and Development\r\n(IGADD) to achieve peace in Somalia. Just last August,\r\nPresident Saleh received the United Nations envoy to\r\nSomalia when he visited to our capital. At that time the\r\nRepublic of Yemen expressed its special interest in the\r\nSomali question and discussed its efforts to find a suitable\r\nsolution to the conflict in Somalia, not only in view of the\r\nhistorical and social links between Yemen and Somalia,\r\nbut also in view of the negative effects this crisis could\r\nhave on our countries and the fact that thousands of\r\nSomali refugees have come to Yemen.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen has affirmed its readiness to\r\ncooperate with the United Nations with a view to\r\nnormalizing the situation in Somalia and enabling that\r\ncountry to become an active member of the international\r\ncommunity. Our joint efforts have resulted in noticeable\r\nprogress in this respect. Our political leadership has\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nreceived a number of Somali leaders and has sought to\r\nsolve outstanding differences in Somalia. This is because of\r\nour belief in the need to safeguard the unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of Somalia and to achieve justice and equality\r\namong its citizens.\r\nFrom this rostrum we hereby call upon our Somali\r\nbrothers to take the initiative themselves and to demonstrate\r\na greater political will and sincere desire to find a peaceful\r\nsolution to the conflict and to attain stability so that\r\nSomalis can restore their national institutions and\r\nreconstruct their country. In this way it will be possible for\r\nSomali refugees to return to their regions and be resettled\r\nin their country.\r\nWe also call upon the international community to\r\nincrease its effort and to provide the necessary assistance\r\nand support to rebuild the State institutions within a\r\nframework of national consensus that is acceptable to all\r\nSomalis.\r\nWhen we met last year Yemen welcomed the\r\nmemorandum of understanding that was signed between\r\nIraq and the United Nations in May 1996 to implement\r\nSecurity Council resolution 986 (1995) on the oil-for-food\r\nformula, it being the first step to alleviate the sufferings of\r\nthe Iraqi people. Yemen was optimistic that this agreement,\r\nwhich was reached after arduous negotiations, would be\r\nimplemented without delay. But we find now that the\r\nimplementation of that agreement often faces great\r\ndifficulties, which has compounded the agony of the Iraqi\r\npeople.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen, while reaffirming the need\r\nfor Iraq to implement all the resolutions of international\r\nlegitimacy and to continue its cooperation with the United\r\nNations, finds it necessary and urgent to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people caused by the embargo\r\nimposed on that country.\r\nThis leads me to talk about the air embargo and other\r\nmeasures imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and\r\nabout the damages and sufferings inflicted upon the\r\nbrotherly Libyan people in consequence of this unfair\r\nembargo. We would like to affirm our call for an end to\r\nthis embargo in the context of the resolutions of the League\r\nof the Arab States, the Organization of African Unity and\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nConcerning Sudan, my country would like to express\r\nits happiness about and support for the new developments\r\nand changes regarding the Khartoum peace agreement,\r\nwhich should receive the support and backing of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community.\r\nWe in the Republic of Yemen look with much\r\nadmiration and respect on the way in which democratic\r\nelections were held recently in the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran. We congratulate its new President on his election,\r\nand we applaud its Government for the approach it has\r\nadopted towards the region. However, we call upon our\r\nbrothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in the United\r\nArab Emirates to continue their direct dialogue in order\r\nto reach a final and peaceful solution to the question of\r\nthe three islands, in accordance with the United Nations\r\nCharter, the principles of international law and the\r\nprinciple of good-neighbourliness.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nthe achievement of sustainable development and respect\r\nfor human rights depend, first and foremost, on the\r\npolitical will of the Member States of this Organization.\r\nYet the selectivity used by the powerful Members of the\r\nOrganization in dealing with others will strip the new\r\nworld order, whose characteristics are not yet\r\nascertainable, of its humanity and the justice to which we\r\nall aspire. Therefore this rostrum and this Organization\r\nrepresent the real safety valve for the security and safety\r\nof all mankind.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Destin-Arsène\r\nTsaty-Boungou, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nFrancophonie of the Congo.\r\nMr. Tsaty-Boungou (Congo) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I wish to congratulate the President on his\r\nbrilliant election to the presidency of the fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly. This election is both a\r\nsign of the respect his country enjoys in the international\r\ncommunity and a tribute by the Members of our\r\nOrganization to his qualities as a diplomat and his\r\noutstanding experience in the United Nations system. All\r\nof this is, undoubtedly, assurance that efficiency will\r\nmark his presidency and a guarantee that the work of the\r\nsession will be successful. My delegation would also like\r\nto express its full gratitude and congratulations to\r\nMr. Udovenko’s predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail\r\nof Malaysia, for his outstanding, imaginative and effective\r\nwork, in particular regarding his numerous initiatives —\r\nespecially the initiative that gave a decisive impetus to the\r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nThe Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has, in a very\r\nshort space of time, done considerable work, in particular\r\nin the area of reform. The results of this work will bring a\r\nnew perspective to the work and objectives of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nI must tell this Assembly that my sorrow is great\r\nbecause so many Congolese children, men and women have\r\nfallen every day since 5 June 1997, under the crossfire of\r\nshells in the civil war that has cast a pall over my country.\r\nTherefore, with the indulgence of the General Assembly, I\r\nwish to devote my comments to this tragic situation.\r\nBut what a dilemma confronts me at this rostrum! As\r\na Minister, I might be tempted to paint a picture of\r\npropaganda, of oversimplification, of extremism and\r\nexclusively of governmental platitudes. The intellectual and\r\nthe patriot I would wish to be must go beyond diplomatic\r\nconvention and express what I feel in my heart — my\r\ndeepest convictions — which are undoubtedly shared by\r\nother Congolese of my generation.\r\nThey feel, as I do, great sorrow for all the victims\r\nwho continue to fall in the camp of President Lissouba and\r\nin that of former President Sassou-Nguesso. And they feel\r\nstrongly, as I do, that the international community has left\r\nthem to their own devices to face this tragedy. And yet in\r\nmy country, which today is in the grip of civil war, almost\r\neverything has been done since the sovereign national\r\nconference to spare our young democracy from the tragic\r\nupheavals inherent in any sudden social change, which in\r\nthis case consisted of the move from a single-party political\r\nregime banning any organized opposition to a veritable\r\nexplosion of freedoms — individual, political and religious.\r\nThe Constitution, the charter of national unity and the\r\nentire institutional and legislative framework set up since\r\nthe transition period, which lasted for more than a year, fall\r\nwithin this framework. The holding of transparent, free and\r\nfair elections — and in particular the presidential election,\r\nwhich put President Pascal Lissouba at the helm of the\r\nState with more than 61 per cent of the vote — was the\r\nharbinger of an outstanding future for the process of\r\ndemocratization in the Congo.\r\nMoreover, President Lissouba has since his election\r\nfocused on establishing mechanisms to consolidate our\r\nyoung democracy. In his quest to establish national\r\ndialogue and social peace, President Lissouba, immediately\r\nfollowing his inauguration, launched an appeal to the\r\nopposition to participate in the government of the Republic.\r\nThat offer, whose purpose was to correct or at least\r\nminimize certain constitutional restrictions, was rejected\r\nby the opposition. From that point on, for the opposition\r\neach lost election became grounds for contention and\r\nconflict. This has further distanced it from political power\r\nand endangered the future of its own leaders.\r\nThe war that has brought bloodshed to Brazzaville,\r\nour capital, is the culmination of the rejection by one\r\nparty of our political class to accept the rules of\r\ndemocracy. The seeds of this war can be found in the\r\neconomic problems and difficulties of the country. Faced\r\nwith this war, we understand — though of course we do\r\nnot share — the indifference of the international\r\ncommunity to the fate of several thousand Africans, lost\r\nin one corner of the globe. The concern of the great\r\neconomic Powers lies in preserving the richness of the\r\nsoil and the subsoil of that area, and the lives of its\r\ninhabitants mean little to them.\r\nBut there are lessons to be learned from this\r\nindifference. It has caused us to look at ourselves as if in\r\na mirror, in order better to understand the place that\r\nAfricans really hold in the community of nations. It has\r\nalso taught us that while patriotism could be a value\r\ncommonly shared by Africans, the cruel reality of Africa,\r\nat least a part of it, is that it counts only for its wealth. So\r\nin times of political setback, Africa can expect from the\r\ninternational community only indifference at the outset\r\nand condescending judgements later on. Often, and\r\nbelatedly, the only consideration it receives is to be\r\nreminded of the human rights violations perpetrated in\r\nwartime by conflicting parties.\r\nBut that right to judge, which we readily recognize\r\nfor other peace-loving and democracy-loving peoples,\r\ndoes it not in turn imply a duty on the part of those who,\r\nin time of war, stand by silently, failing to provide\r\nhumanitarian assistance to a people threatened with death\r\nand extinction? The people of the Congo, who have, since\r\n5 June 1997, been dying slowly under fire from rockets\r\nand cannons — bought by the Congolese, yes, but sold to\r\nthem by Western “philanthropists” — do they not deserve\r\nto benefit from that much-vaunted right to humanitarian\r\nintervention?\r\nWe refuse to believe that, in the framework of our\r\nOrganization, whose solid, founding values include the\r\nprinciple of justice and equality among peoples, this right\r\nto humanitarian intervention, which on a global scale\r\ninvolves an obligation to solidarity and to safeguard life,\r\napplies only to certain colours or geographic locations,\r\ndepending on the colour or the geographic location of the\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nvictims. If that belief were to be a certainty, or even to\r\nexist, then it would — at least for some of the Members of\r\nour Organization — undermine needlessly and in a lasting\r\nway the legitimate trust that so many peoples, the innocent\r\nvictims of atrocities and injustice, have placed in the United\r\nNations.\r\nSome Members of this Organization are tempted to\r\nsay that the Congolese must solve their problems\r\nthemselves, and we must take this appeal to our sense of\r\nresponsibility into consideration. Yet while today it is the\r\nCongolese people who are hostages, perhaps tomorrow it\r\nwill be another people’s turn to be taken hostage by a\r\npolitical class that is driven by selfish ambitions,\r\nunprepared to accept the rules of democracy and\r\nuninterested in seeking and maintaining peace.\r\nEvery day and at an increasing human cost, the\r\nexcessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance of\r\nothers defer to a later date the establishment of conditions\r\nfor a negotiated peace. That is what happened at Libreville\r\nduring the second week of September 1997. President\r\nPascal Lissouba agreed with President Omar Bongo,\r\nPresident of the international mediation committee, on a\r\nplan for the country to be run by a presidential college\r\ncomposed of the incumbent President of the Republic and\r\nthree Vice-Presidents. But many Congolese saw in this\r\nproposal an effort at power-sharing among those individuals\r\nvying for power in the Congo and, hence, an end to the\r\nwar.\r\nUnfortunately, their hopes were dashed as a nightmare\r\nscenario unfolded. In response to this proposal from the\r\ninternational mediation committee, the United Democratic\r\nForces of former President Sassou-Nguesso demanded that\r\nthe First Vice-President be one of their own and that he\r\nexercise also the functions of Prime Minister of Minister of\r\nDefence. Such a demand, in view of the political history of\r\nour country, marked as it is by numerous coups d’état that\r\nto this day still have supporters, could not be accepted by\r\nthe Government nor by the other parties of the most\r\nrepresentative opposition.\r\nFollowing that refusal by former President Sassou-\r\nNguesso, a new Government was formed. Mr. Bernard\r\nKolélas, Mayor of the city of Brazzaville and leader of the\r\nopposition, was appointed head of that new Government.\r\nSeveral ministerial posts were reserved for the former\r\nsingle party, the Congolese Labour Party of former\r\nPresident Sassou-Nguesso.\r\nTo date, this effort to join the Government has also\r\nbeen rejected by the armed opposition. What is to be\r\ndone?\r\nThe Government continues to believe in the virtue of\r\ndialogue and not in the force of weapons. That is why it\r\ncontinues to hope that the efforts of the International\r\nMediation Committee will offer the Congo a chance for\r\nlasting peace, and for a transition managed jointly by the\r\nvarious political forces of the country so that our people\r\ncan freely elect its President.\r\nWith the goal of finding this negotiated solution,\r\nPresident Pascal Lissouba and Prime Minister Bernard\r\nKolélas recently signed the ceasefire plan proposed by the\r\nInternational Mediation Committee. To date, only\r\nMr. Sassou-Nguesso has not signed.\r\nWhen those who make secret contributions to\r\nfratricidal massacres and destabilization in some\r\ndemocratic States, guided by their own interests, invoke\r\nthe principle of non-interference as a pretext to give them\r\ngreater freedom to manoeuvre, should we not fear that\r\nhere non-interference may well become, given the\r\ncomplaisance and the silence of the United Nations, the\r\nworst form of interference against these massacred\r\npeoples and these destabilized States?\r\nJust about a year ago, speaking before this same\r\nAssembly, I questioned the relevance of applying the rule\r\nof rotation of power in the context of democratization in\r\nour countries, which are economically weak and whose\r\npolitical classes have for a long time gained their fortunes\r\nand their social ascendancy exclusively from political\r\nactions. The events in my country, unfortunately, give\r\ngreater meaning to this question. We are called upon to\r\nunderstand better our contemporary political history and\r\nthe need to share power in order to ensure a lasting peace\r\nand to better ensure the success of the democratic regime.\r\nIn the economic and historical context of some\r\nAfrican countries, this approach towards democracy, with\r\nthe development of respect for its basic needs, can be a\r\nfactor for peace and development, instead of being a\r\nfactor for destabilization and a vehicle for heightened\r\nethnic hatreds during elections, as in the case today in my\r\ncountry.\r\nThis is a fundamental question, and undoubtedly my\r\ncountry, today at war, will be able to answer it by finding\r\nthe road of reason, peace and pursuit of the democratic\r\nprocess. The road leading to democracy in my country,\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nwhich has for a long time been under the yoke of a single-\r\nparty regime that flouted freedoms under a quickly\r\nabandoned ideology, has been seen as a crossroads by our\r\npeople.\r\nThe opposite would have been preferred but\r\nsurprising, because the single-party regime and\r\ntotalitarianism cannot disappear without jolts or resistance.\r\nOur struggle — that of all the Congolese who believe\r\nin the values of democracy, in the development of the\r\nhuman being in a democracy, in the unleashing of greater\r\nintelligence and energy in our country thanks to democracy\r\nand its regime of freedom will be in vain if the\r\ninternational community — primarily the United Nations —\r\ndoes not show us any sign of the solidarity that could, once\r\nand for all, in spirit and in fact, do away with the\r\ntemptation to resort to weapons to gain power.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Congo wishes to\r\nexpress once again its regret and its great compassion to the\r\nGovernment and to the brotherly people of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo for the damage and loss of life\r\nresulting from the Brazzaville war. We are convinced that\r\nthe peoples of the two Congos, who have already shed too\r\nmuch blood and too many tears in their history and in their\r\nreturn to a state of law, wish to live in peace together.\r\nThat is why this situation has shown us how urgent it\r\nis for all peace-loving and democracy-loving forces to come\r\nto the aid of the Congolese as quickly as possible in order\r\nto find a solution to return peace to Brazzaville and to\r\nspare the entire subregion the further spread of destabilizing\r\nacts and war.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the commitment of some\r\nGovernments that, in view of the Congolese tragedy, have\r\nmade known their readiness to provide troops that could\r\nconstitute a multinational interposition force, given the\r\nprocrastination of the United Nations.\r\nThe wounded and the dead in our own country have\r\nhelped us better understand and better regret such suffering\r\nin the rest of the world. We wish here to express our\r\nfeeling of solidarity with all other peoples that are\r\nsuffering, the Algerian people in particular. There again,\r\nour hope is that reason will prevail over any other\r\nconsideration so that Algeria can pursue its economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nI wish to conclude by affirming that the political\r\ndetermination to restore peace to Brazzaville exists.\r\nHowever, the return to peace is made difficult in the field\r\nby the fact that any deliberate or uncontrolled shooting\r\nmight, at any moment, lead to a further escalation of\r\nviolence and might endanger numerous human lives.\r\nThese acts are committed with such ease, irresponsibility\r\nand impunity that there is no neutral international force in\r\nBrazzaville that can determine who is responsible.\r\nWe believe that the presence of the troops of the\r\nmultinational force envisaged by the Secretary-General,\r\nwhich was never established, would have enabled us to\r\nmove more quickly and more surely towards lasting\r\npeace.\r\nMay our appeal for help be heard, or may it result\r\nin greater understanding for future calls of distress. And\r\nmay my comments from this rostrum resonate within each\r\nof us, like an echo in this General Assembly, to spare\r\nother African peoples from ever suffering the torments of\r\nwar or the dictatorship of a handful of lawless and\r\nfaithless politicians, with wheelers and dealers on all sides\r\nwho are themselves lawless and faithless.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the debate for this\r\nmeeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind\r\nmembers that, in accordance with General Assembly\r\ndecision 34/401, statements in exercise of the right of\r\nreply shall be limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to 5 minutes for the second and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Tanç (Turkey): In reply to the speech of the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Greece on 26 September,\r\nI wish to state the following: that statement contains false\r\naccusations and misrepresentations of facts concerning\r\nTurkey.\r\nThe General Assembly is an august body where\r\ninternational issues are debated with a view to their\r\nresolution. However, unfortunately, it has long been a\r\npractice of Greece to exploit the general debate for\r\npropaganda purposes and to disseminate misleading\r\ninformation about significant issues between Turkey and\r\nGreece.\r\nThe general state of mind that shaped the portion of\r\nthe statement concerning my country was perhaps\r\nreflected in the words the Minister used when he spoke to\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\na Greek television station one day before his speech to the\r\nUnited Nations. Then, with reference to presumably\r\nimaginary interlocutors on the Turkish side, and without\r\nany rational reason, he said that he would not negotiate\r\nwith a “murderer, rapist and thief” — hardly words\r\nbefitting a statesman or this Assembly. But they are\r\nindicative of a certain mentality which robs the allegations\r\nin the Minister’s speech of credibility and validity.\r\nThis approach to Turkish-Greek relations stands in\r\nstark contrast to the well-intentioned and conciliatory policy\r\nthat the Turkish Government is pursuing with a view to\r\nfinding solutions to the problems existing between the two\r\ncountries. Turkey’s positive and constructive attitude was\r\nreflected in the statement made by the Turkish Foreign\r\nMinister soon after that made by his Greek counterpart. The\r\nTurkish Foreign Minister stressed, inter alia,\r\n“In our relations with Greece, our principal\r\nobjective is to promptly tackle, through a substantive\r\nand result-oriented dialogue, the issues ... that still\r\nstand between our two countries ... we have made\r\nseveral appeals to Greece to agree to a dialogue ...\r\n“We do not rule out any agreed method of\r\npeaceful settlement of our differences ... we have\r\nimplemented unilaterally a number of confidence-\r\nbuilding measures in the hope that they would be\r\nreciprocated. We expect that the group of Wisemen\u0027,\r\nconsisting of two ... personalities from Turkey and\r\nGreece ... will be able to finally meet ...\r\n“We also eagerly await the translation into\r\nconcrete deeds, to promote better relations between\r\nour two countries, of the understanding reached ... in\r\nMadrid last July ...\r\n“... our bilateral problems cannot be resolved by\r\nthe efforts of Turkey alone, and ... mutual\r\ncommitment and the display of goodwill by both\r\nparties are imperative.” [See Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 14th meeting]\r\nAs referred to in the statement of my Foreign\r\nMinister, the Presidents of the two countries adopted a joint\r\ndeclaration in Madrid only a few months ago, in July,\r\naimed at improving bilateral relations. They set up a group\r\nof “Wisemen” to study and prepare recommendations on\r\nthe outstanding issues. Efforts are being made to bridge the\r\ngap between the respective positions. However, the attitude\r\nof Greece has not yet conformed to that positive mood. In\r\nfact, the Greek Government’s spokesman, Mr. Reppas,\r\nmade an announcement on 23 September that Greece was\r\nsuspending the planned meeting between the Turkish and\r\nGreek members of the group because, he said,\r\n“the most suitable conditions do not exist at this\r\ntime”.\r\nAs the Minister made several references to\r\ninternational law and treaties in his statement, I would\r\nlike to draw the particular attention of the Assembly to\r\nthe Greek claim of different breadths of territorial sea and\r\nnational airspace in the Aegean. It is an unequivocal\r\nprinciple of international law that the breadth of national\r\nairspace should correspond to the breadth of territorial\r\nwaters, as stipulated in articles 1 and 2 of the Chicago\r\nConvention on International Civil Aviation. Greece’s\r\nclaim of an airspace of 10 miles, regardless of its 6-mile\r\nterritorial sea, is a clear manifestation of Greece’s\r\ndisregard of international law, and is, in fact, rejected by\r\nthe international community. Could the Greek Foreign\r\nMinister, who so frequently refers to the attachment of his\r\ncountry to international law, explain to this Assembly its\r\nstance with respect to the breadth of territorial sea and\r\nairspace in the Aegean, which is one of the elements\r\ncausing friction between our countries?\r\nCould Greece convincingly defend its violation of\r\nthe status of the eastern Aegean islands, which are very\r\nclearly placed under a demilitarized regime by\r\ninternational treaties? Could Greece, which insists on\r\nreferring the Kardak issue to the International Court of\r\nJustice, also agree to take the issue of the violation of the\r\ndemilitarized status of the eastern Aegean islands to the\r\nCourt, by waiving its reservation clause, which excludes\r\nfrom the jurisdiction of the Court any dispute relating to\r\ndefensive military actions taken by Greece, even though\r\nthey violate international treaties and law?\r\nThese realities reflect the “à la carte” approach of\r\nGreece to matters of international law.\r\nThe international community is also well informed\r\nabout developments in Cyprus, which has been on the\r\nUnited Nations agenda for 34 years. We are convinced\r\nthat the international community, familiar with these\r\nissues for several decades, will easily distinguish between\r\nfact and fiction, between propaganda and truth. It is only\r\nworth wondering why, at a time when so much effort is\r\nunder way to find peaceful solutions to these problems,\r\nGreece prefers to engage in acrimony and propaganda,\r\nand avoids reciprocating the hand of conciliation and\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nfriendship extended by Turkey. One wonders if Greece sees\r\nany advantage in prolonging the disputes between itself and\r\nTurkey. We wish to point out in this connection that such\r\na policy can only be detrimental to Greece itself.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nYesterday the Assembly heard a statement by the Foreign\r\nMinister of Burundi in which he spoke at length about the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania and its role in the search for\r\npeace in his country. In a litany of lies and self-serving\r\nfalsifications, the Foreign Minister sought to ascribe to\r\nTanzania responsibility for the problems in Burundi and the\r\nfailure of the peace process so far.\r\nWhile in no way seeking to answer the specific\r\naccusations levelled at my country, I wish simply to put the\r\nrecord straight.\r\nTanzania is a neighbour of Burundi. We are linked by\r\ngeography, history, blood and friendship. Since\r\nindependence over three decades ago, Tanzania has\r\nendured, with our brothers in Burundi, the immense\r\nsuffering arising from cyclical conflicts and wars in that\r\ncountry. Over the years we have hosted Burundi refugees\r\nin their hundreds of thousands, and continue to do so today.\r\nWe have been sympathetic to the unique problems of\r\nBurundi, notwithstanding our clear knowledge and\r\nconviction that these had their roots in politics of rigidity,\r\nextremism and exclusion practised by successive military\r\ndictatorships which have ruled that country almost\r\nuninterrupted for the last 30 years. We continued to\r\nencourage the Burundi authorities on the path of political\r\naccommodation and dialogue.\r\nTanzania and the rest of the international community\r\nwas naturally gratified when in the 1980s the then President\r\nBuyoya initiated a political reform programme which\r\nculminated in the first democratic elections of July 1993\r\nand the assumption of power by the Frodebu party under\r\nthe late President Melchior Ndadaye. We congratulated\r\nMajor Buyoya and the Burundi people on their political\r\ncourage, which had permitted their country’s transition from\r\na military dictatorship to democracy.\r\nIt naturally came as a rude shock when, a few months\r\nlater, the Burundi military reversed the gains of democracy.\r\nThe brutal assassination of President Ndadaye and a\r\nnumber of his senior colleagues in the Government and\r\nLegislature were calculated to wipe out political authority\r\nand create a vacuum which could easily be filled by the\r\nmilitary or its appointees.\r\nEven in the face of this brutal transgression,\r\nTanzania, and indeed the international community, did not\r\ntake measures beyond condemnation. We continued to see\r\nthe need to nurture the delicate transition to democratic\r\nrule there as our primary objective. The subsequent\r\nefforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nthrough its mission in Burundi, had the full support of\r\nTanzania.\r\nEqually, the consultations which led to the\r\nConvention on Government and the presidency of\r\nSylvestre Ntibantunganya had our general support. We\r\nsupported that process, but not because we believed it was\r\nfair or democratic. It was a cynical process which was\r\ncalculated to put a halt to the democratic transition by\r\nascribing political roles to pseudo-parties which could not\r\nwin even a single seat in Parliament, and whose\r\nmembership could not exceed a handful of individuals.\r\nIt was soon to be clear that the real objective of the\r\nConvention of Government was to complete the military\r\ncoup which had started with the murder of President\r\nNdadaye. The internal destabilization campaigns,\r\nincluding the operation “Dead city” waged by the army\r\nand extremist political parties, all served to create an\r\natmosphere of insecurity and intimidation that in turn\r\njustified high-handedness and obstruction of the political\r\nprocess.\r\nThroughout this period, Tanzania remained\r\ncommitted to its duties as a responsible neighbour and\r\ncontinued to urge the Burundi politicians and the army to\r\nsee reason and the imperative of political dialogue with\r\nall segments of their society. We continued to urge the\r\nreturn to constitutional rule so that the country could\r\nbegin the task of healing and national reconstruction.\r\nIt was in the spirit of assisting the Burundi people\r\nalong the path of peace that Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, on\r\nbehalf of the Organization of African Unity and the\r\ncountries of the region, accepted the task of facilitating\r\npolitical dialogue among the warring parties within the\r\nframework of the Mwanza Peace Process. We regret the\r\nfact that, notwithstanding the great effort made, the\r\npolitical class in Burundi refused to commit themselves in\r\ngood faith to the success of the Mwanza Process.\r\nIt was a matter of deep regret that the military,\r\nunder Major Buyoya, chose to disregard international\r\nopinion and the then ongoing process within the Mwanza\r\nframework and took over power in July 1996. That act of\r\nusurpation of power was roundly condemned by Africa\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nand the entire international community. The countries of the\r\nregion met at Arusha in the aftermath of the Buyoya coup\r\nand spelt out conditions which the military rulers had to\r\nmeet within a prescribed time. These included the\r\nreinstatement of the Constitution and the Parliament, the\r\nunbanning of political parties and the return of the military\r\nto their barracks. In the same vein, the first Arusha Summit\r\nreiterated the readiness of the region to continue the process\r\nof political dialogue within the Mwanza framework, under\r\nMwalimu Nyerere, aimed at a negotiated settlement of the\r\nconflict in Burundi. Today, that remains our central\r\nobjective. Indeed, the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nUnited Nations have been kept informed of all the\r\ndevelopments in the region and are supportive of our\r\nefforts.\r\nTanzania has repeatedly stated that we have no other\r\ninterest in Burundi than to assist the people of that country\r\nto live in peace with one another within their boundaries.\r\nThat has been the consistent policy of the region as well.\r\nThe problems of Burundi affect us. We have borne the\r\nbrunt of the burden of hosting the Burundi refugees caused\r\nby the cyclical political conflicts in that country. Failure of\r\nleadership in Burundi continues to affect us adversely. It is\r\ncynical for the Burundi authorities to suggest that Tanzania\r\nwould derive any advantage from the instability of their\r\ncountry.\r\nThe problems are in Burundi and not elsewhere. No\r\nmatter how much the Burundi authorities try to bury their\r\nheads in the sand, they cannot wish away the imperative of\r\npolitical accommodation, power-sharing and security for all\r\nin their country. The problem is not a bilateral one between\r\nBurundi and Tanzania or with the region. The problem is\r\nwithin and among the Burundi people.\r\nTanzania has not supported, does not support, and will\r\nnot support any armed aggression against Burundi by any\r\ngroup. The alleged armed incursions emanating from the\r\nrefugee camps or military training in them are, at best,\r\nillusions created by the Burundi authorities to justify further\r\noppression of their people. At any rate, Tanzania does not\r\nrun the refugee camps and has no knowledge of such\r\ntransgression of Burundi territory. The Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and other non-\r\ngovernmental organizations have stated categorically that no\r\nsuch training is being carried out in the refugee camps.\r\nTanzania would be happy to be furnished with evidence of\r\nsuch military activities so that it can put an end to them, as\r\nthey would violate our sovereignty.\r\nThe presence of the refugee camps near the border\r\nis necessary and will continue. It is not to be expected of\r\nTanzania that it create any new permanent homes for\r\nBurundi refugees. We have done so in the past — in\r\n1965 and 1972. To do so now would be to deny the\r\nrefugees the right and opportunity to repatriate early. It\r\nwould also serve to countenance the irrationality of the\r\nBurundi authorities and their failure to make the\r\nnecessary political amends in the mistaken belief that the\r\nrefugees generated by their political irresponsibility would\r\nbe shunted away from their eyes. We continue to believe\r\nthat their proximity to their homeland is an incentive to\r\nan early return and poses little logistical difficulty for that\r\nprocess. We saw it when half a million Rwandese\r\nrefugees chose to walk back home last year when they\r\nfelt assured of their security.\r\nThe region, and not Tanzania, imposed sanctions\r\nagainst Burundi as an incentive to negotiation. The region\r\nstated that once there was reason to believe that the\r\npolitical process had taken an irreversible course the\r\nregion would have no reason to persist in sanctions. Even\r\nwithout evidence of such irreversibility, the region has\r\nrelaxed sanctions in order to respond to the humanitarian\r\nneeds of the innocent people there. The onus now rests\r\nwith the Burundi authorities to deliver their part of the\r\nbargain rather than searching for scapegoats in the form\r\nof partiality of the mediator or insecurity of the venue.\r\nArguments of insecurity in Tanzania are fictitious. At no\r\npoint was any Burundi official or negotiator harassed or\r\nthreatened. Indeed, many Burundi officials come to and\r\nleave Tanzania freely, without hindrance. It hence comes\r\nas no surprise that they raise the bogey of so-called\r\ninsecurity to mask their reluctance to pursue political\r\ndialogue. We reject the allegation that Tanzania has\r\nhanded over the Burundi Embassy to one party. It is not\r\nwithin our means as a law-abiding Government to do so.\r\nTo our understanding, the present diplomat manning the\r\nEmbassy is there consequent to the sharing of posts under\r\nthe Convention of Government. His continued stay or\r\ndeparture is a matter within the competence of the\r\nBurundi authorities, and not Tanzania.\r\nTanzania has stated repeatedly that if the problems\r\nare the mediator or the venue, these are issues which\r\ncould be discussed not with Burundi but within the\r\nregion, which confirmed the mandate to Tanzania and\r\nMwalimu Nyerere. But, ultimately, the issue is not the\r\nproliferation of forums or mediators or venues; it is one\r\nof negotiation of acceptable arrangements for political\r\naccommodation and security for all. The region or the\r\ninternational community cannot afford to let the present\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 24th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 3 October 1997\r\nirresponsibility of the Burundi authorities plunge that\r\ncountry into a catastrophe. We are still too painfully aware\r\nof the horrendous genocide in Rwanda.\r\nTanzania remains positively disposed towards Burundi,\r\nand we will continue to assist, notwithstanding the\r\nlack of appreciation on the part of the Burundi authorities.\r\nAs part of the region, we will continue to urge the\r\nmilitary authorities to see reason and reseize the\r\nopportunity of dialogue. We invite the Burundi authorities\r\nnot to persist in illusions of an internal limited settlement\r\nand to reciprocate the goodwill of the region. No partial\r\nor military solution is sustainable. If it were, we would\r\nnot be talking about Burundi, which has been under\r\nmilitary rule for decades. The enduring security of the\r\nBurundi people lies in dialogue and political\r\naccommodation, and not elsewhere.\r\nMr. Hermenegilde (Burundi) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The representative of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania said that he did not wish to engage in polemics,\r\nand I too wish to avoid them. However, I wish to state\r\nthat I would prefer to give my reply and provide evidence\r\nat the beginning of next week, so that the Assembly may\r\nsee the grounds for everything that my Foreign Minister\r\nsaid yesterday.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nWe will reserve our right to reply when Burundi makes\r\nits statement.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n32\r\n"
