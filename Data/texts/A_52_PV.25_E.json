(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 120 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/52/350/Add.2)\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the General\r\nAssembly’s attention to document A/52/350/Add.2. In a\r\nletter contained in that document, the Secretary-General\r\ninforms the President of the General Assembly that, since\r\nthe issuance of his communications dated 16 and 29\r\nSeptember 1997, Chad has made the necessary payment to\r\nreduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19\r\nof the Charter. May I take it that the General Assembly\r\nduly takes note of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAddress by Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, His Excellency Mr.\r\nGlafcos Clerides, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Clerides: I would like to begin by\r\nextending to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-second session. We are certain that your long\r\nexperience and diplomatic skills will guide us successfully\r\nin our work at this session of the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to thank your predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the determined\r\nleadership with which he steered our work at the fifty-\r\nfirst session.\r\nOur Organization, with its universal membership,\r\ncomprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities,\r\nis the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the\r\nuniversal goals we all strive for: a secure and peaceful\r\nfuture, a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor, full\r\nrespect for human rights, free and equitable trade, the\r\nprotection of the environment and the promotion of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nI am pleased once again to be able to take this\r\nopportunity to renew our commitment to the ideals and\r\naims that all of us here share.\r\nThis year is a landmark in the reform process of the\r\nUnited Nations because of the active measures taken by\r\nthe Secretary-General of our Organization to tackle long-\r\nstanding and deep-rooted issues. Last July, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral presented to us a comprehensive package of\r\nreforms designed to help the Organization rationalize and\r\nstreamline its operations, secure its financial position and\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nrefocus itself to meet the changes in the global order, thus\r\nallowing the United Nations to fully utilize the strengths\r\nand expertise it already possesses.\r\nWe are therefore particularly pleased to welcome these\r\nproposals by the Secretary-General. We hope that, by the\r\nconclusion of the debate on this issue that will take place\r\nin the plenary during this session, we shall reach a\r\nconsensus, thus creating the necessary momentum for their\r\nspeedy implementation, and produce concrete results before\r\nwe reach the new millennium.\r\nThe reforms are being introduced at a time when it is\r\ngenerally acknowledged that the High-Level Working\r\nGroups mandated by the General Assembly to examine\r\nspecific issues, from the restructuring and strengthening of\r\nthe main United Nations organs to ensuring a firmer and\r\nlasting financing for our Organization, have yet to achieve\r\nsubstantial progress.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I have stated before that we\r\nsubscribe to the need to reform the Security Council by\r\nmaking it representative of the increase in the membership\r\nof the United Nations and reflect the changes in the post-\r\ncold-war world. We consider the need to reform the\r\nSecurity Council a top priority, for it directly affects its\r\ncapacity to discharge its cardinal responsibility — that of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the progress already\r\nachieved in the working methods of the Security Council\r\nand expect further steps towards transparency and\r\ndemocratization. A number of proposals have been put\r\nforward by Member States over the last three years. Further\r\ndeliberations are required, however, to achieve an\r\nagreement that would command the general support of the\r\nmembership of the Organization.\r\nAn important step this year concerns the work of the\r\nOrganization in the field of international economic and\r\nsocial cooperation. After three years of hard deliberation,\r\nthe General Assembly adopted its Agenda for Development\r\nlast June. This is a great step forward because, as the\r\nSecretary-General himself states in his report on the work\r\nof the Organization, it addresses not only the conventional\r\ndevelopment issues but also stresses the mutually supportive\r\nthough complex relationships among development, peace,\r\ndemocracy, good governance and human rights.\r\nEqually important was the convening of the nineteenth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly to review the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 — the global plan of action\r\nfor sustainable development — which was adopted five\r\nyears ago at the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro.\r\nI believe that an important part of the future work of\r\nthis Organization will lie in following up the work done\r\nat the major conferences and in reviewing the\r\nimplementation of the plans and programmes they\r\nadopted.\r\nThe United Nations of the future must give most\r\nurgent priority to the Agenda for Development. Any\r\nmodern concept of international peace must recognize that\r\npeace, security and development are indivisible.\r\nIt is indisputable that one of the major strengths of\r\nthe United Nations is its universality. It is at once global,\r\nregional and locally based. It has achieved great results in\r\nthe fields of international interaction. Its activities have a\r\ntremendous effect on our everyday lives.\r\nAt this juncture, I should commend and stress the\r\nimportant role of the Organization in the promotion of\r\nfull respect for and universal application of human rights,\r\nas well as for the progressive development and\r\ncodification of international law. In this respect, we fully\r\nsupport the establishment of the international criminal\r\ncourt, which we have long advocated, and welcome the\r\nprogress made in the Preparatory Committee and the\r\nincreased momentum towards its fruition.\r\nThough local and ethnic conflicts still persist,\r\nseriously affecting the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, the role of the Organization in disarmament\r\nfor the past twelve months has been marked by great\r\nsteps. A number of significant conventions have already\r\nbeen concluded or have entered into force. In welcoming\r\nthese achievements we feel we must continue to move\r\nahead for their full and effective implementation.\r\nWe must also cherish the Organization’s contribution\r\nto development and education, its work against hunger\r\nand illiteracy and, in short, its role in restoring and\r\nupholding human dignity.\r\nWe believe in the United Nations and in the Charter,\r\nnot as an abstract ideal, but as a functioning,\r\nindispensable, concrete entity. The principles and ideals\r\nof the United Nations have formed the cornerstone of our\r\nforeign policy since our independence and membership in\r\nthe United Nations. We are fully committed to\r\nstrengthening the Organization by helping it tackle its\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nprecarious financial position, streamline and rationalize its\r\noperations and exploit to the full its uniqueness and its\r\nunrivalled expertise. We are confident that the Organization\r\nwill be able to harness the forces of change in ways that\r\nwill benefit us all.\r\nThis year the United Nations has been especially\r\nactive on certain long-outstanding issues such as East\r\nTimor, Western Sahara, the situation in the Middle East and\r\nCyprus.\r\nWe welcome the developments on the question of\r\nWestern Sahara and the agreement reached on the\r\nimplementation of the settlement plan under the auspices of\r\nthe Secretary-General and his Special Envoy. We hope that\r\nthese positive achievements will move the peace process\r\nforward and bring a final settlement to this long drawn-out\r\nsituation of tension and conflict.\r\nDespite our earlier hopes based on the peace\r\nagreement, the current events in the Middle East and the\r\nworsening situation in the occupied territories are cause for\r\ngreat concern. As a neighbouring country, we wish to\r\nreiterate our support for the efforts to achieve peace in the\r\narea on the basis of the agreements reached and of the\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nAs to the question of Cyprus, 1997 has been a year of\r\nintense diplomatic activity, culminating in face-to-face\r\nintercommunal talks under the auspices of the United\r\nNations last July and August in Troutbeck and Glion,\r\nrespectively. The resumption of the talks was the result of\r\nthe untiring efforts of the Secretary-General, encouraged\r\nand actively supported by the international community. The\r\nSecurity Council closely pursued the developments on the\r\nquestion of Cyprus, and nine individual countries appointed\r\nspecial representatives on Cyprus. The European Union,\r\nthrough the Special Representative of the Presidency, was\r\nalso following developments closely.\r\nWhen invited by Mr. Kofi Annan last June to attend\r\nface-to-face talks with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot\r\ncommunity in Troutbeck and later in Glion, we responded\r\npositively and demonstrated our sincere and unwavering\r\ncommitment to the peace process as the only means of\r\nsolving the Cyprus question, and our will to work for a\r\ncomprehensive, just and viable solution.\r\nOur will was tested even harder when, on the eve of\r\nthe talks, Turkey and the so-called Turkish Republic of\r\nNorthern Cyprus, which is not recognized internationally\r\nexcept by Turkey, signed an illegal agreement purporting to\r\nlead to the annexation by Turkey of the areas occupied by\r\nthe Turkish forces if the European Union proceeded to\r\naccession negotiations with Cyprus. Despite this enormous\r\nprovocation, we reacted in a low key in order to avoid\r\ntension which would affect adversely the climate of the\r\ntalks.\r\nDuring the talks we worked hard and cooperated\r\nconstructively with Mr. Cordovez, the Secretary-General’s\r\nSpecial Adviser, with the sole aim of breaking the\r\nimpasse and moving forward to reverse the status quo\r\ncreated and maintained by Turkey since 1974 by the use\r\nof force and declared unacceptable by numerous Security\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nIn contrast, the response of the other side was\r\ncompletely negative. Despite our constructive attitude,\r\ndespite the efforts of Mr. Cordovez and those of other\r\ninterested countries through their representatives,\r\nMr. Denktaş refused to hold any discussions on the\r\nsubstance of the Cyprus problem unless the European\r\nUnion froze its plans for accession talks with the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Cyprus, which were in\r\naccordance with the European decision of 6 March 1995.\r\nMr. Denktaş even threatened that if the European Union\r\ndecided to proceed with Cyprus’ application he would not\r\nnegotiate at all in the future. It was therefore abundantly\r\nclear that the other side did not go to the talks with the\r\naim of finding a solution to the problem, but in an\r\nattempt to impede Cyprus’ European Union accession\r\nprocess.\r\nAny doubts as to the real cause of the failure of the\r\ntalks to produce results on the substantive aspects of the\r\nCyprus problem were dissolved by the unanimous verdict\r\nof the international community, pronounced last 20\r\nAugust by the President of the Security Council in a\r\nstatement to the press after the briefing by Mr. Cordovez\r\non the outcome of the talks in Glion. In the statement, our\r\npositive attitude and cooperation was commended,\r\nwhereas the Turkish Cypriot side was blamed for\r\nimpeding substantive progress by the attempt to bring in\r\npreconditions to the table. The same verdict was reached\r\nby the European Union, which also rejected any link\r\nbetween the talks and the start of the European Union’s\r\naccession negotiations with Cyprus.\r\nIt is with great regret that once again in addressing\r\nthe General Assembly I have to report that no progress\r\nhas been made towards the solution of the Cyprus\r\nproblem due to the inflexibility of the Turkish side.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nThe result of this deliberate inflexibility is the\r\nperpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per cent\r\nof the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces,\r\nthe artificial forceful separation of the two communities, the\r\ncolonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers from\r\nTurkey, the refugee problem, the usurpation of the Greek\r\nCypriot properties in the occupied area and the continued\r\nblunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assembly\r\nand Security Council resolutions.\r\nI fully share the disappointment of the Security\r\nCouncil at the absence of progress during the Glion talks,\r\ndespite the interest shown by the international community,\r\nand more particularly by those countries that had their\r\nrepresentatives in the wings observing the talks. The clear\r\nconclusion to be drawn, however, is that more active\r\ninvolvement of the international community, and in\r\nparticular of those who are in the wings of the talks, is\r\nneeded if the talks are to produce results.\r\nAfter the end of the talks, Mr. Denktash and Ankara\r\ncontinued to maintain the same negative attitude. There was\r\na barrage of threatening statements against Cyprus, in direct\r\nviolation of international law, and in particular of the\r\nUnited Nations resolutions on Cyprus, which, inter alia,\r\ncall for the respect of the sovereignty, independence,\r\nterritorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus and\r\nthe withdrawal of all foreign troops.\r\nThe Turkish side continues to threaten to annex to\r\nTurkey the territory of the Republic occupied by Turkish\r\nforces if the European Union commences accession\r\nnegotiations with Cyprus, and to use force against the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus to prevent the implementation of the\r\nagreement to buy and instal in Cyprus the S-300 defensive\r\nground-to-air missile system.\r\nLast year we pledged before this body our\r\ncommitment to do everything in our power to help the\r\nSecretary-General of our Organization succeed in his\r\nrenewed efforts in the search for a lasting solution to the\r\nCyprus problem. I believe that we have honoured our\r\npledge to the full. I wish to reiterate our commitment to\r\ncontinue our constructive attitude, despite our\r\ndisappointment.\r\nHowever, I wish to make it abundantly clear that we\r\ncannot and we will not relinquish our inalienable right to\r\ndefend our country and to decide about our armaments. As\r\nlong as the Turkish threat emanating from the continued\r\naggression and occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of\r\nthe Republic exists, we have not only the right but also the\r\nduty to provide for the security of the people of Cyprus.\r\nWe will not tie our hands behind our backs and allow the\r\nTurkish air force to bomb our towns and villages at will\r\n— as it has done in the past — without the ability to\r\ndefend ourselves. If it is again necessary for our forces to\r\ntake the battlefield, never again will they do so without\r\nadequate protection from air attacks by the Turkish air\r\nforce.\r\nDuring the talks in Glion, in an attempt to assist the\r\npeace process, I proposed to Mr. Denktash that both\r\nleaders should make a declaration denouncing the use of\r\nforce as a means of solving the Cyprus problem and\r\nshould agree to work for a specific programme of\r\nreduction of military forces and equipment and a\r\nprogramme for demilitarizing the island and limiting the\r\nimportation of arms.\r\nI believe that my proposal, if accepted by the other\r\nside, may open the way for substantive progress towards\r\na comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus question and\r\nthe restoration of respect for the human rights of the\r\npeople of Cyprus, which have been grossly violated for\r\nthe last 23 years.\r\nTo my Turkish Cypriot compatriots I wish to say\r\nthis: Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots will live in\r\nCyprus for centuries to come. We must live as friends\r\nand as citizens of a bi-communal, bi-zonal federal\r\nRepublic, respecting each other’s ethnic origins, traditions,\r\nculture and religion and the equal political status of our\r\nrespective communities. We must also be citizens of the\r\nEuropean Union. This will give us greater security and\r\nprosperity, both for our respective communities and for\r\nCyprus, our country.\r\nThe question of Cyprus has been on the agenda of\r\nthe United Nations for too long. A momentum has been\r\ncreated for the solution of the Cyprus problem as a result\r\nof the renewed efforts of the United Nations, strongly\r\nsupported by the international community. Let us not miss\r\nthis opportunity. It is clear by now where the attention of\r\nthe Security Council and the international community\r\nshould be focused. It should use all the means in its\r\npower to persuade the Turkish side to abandon its\r\nintransigent position.\r\nLet me assure this body once again that my\r\nGovernment will continue to work with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his efforts to find a solution based on a State\r\nof Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international\r\npersonality and a single citizenship, with its independence\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nand territorial integrity safeguarded and comprising two\r\npolitically equal communities, as described in the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, in a bi-communal and bi-zonal\r\nfederation, and that such settlement must exclude union, in\r\nwhole or in part, with any other country or any form of\r\npartition or secession.\r\nAt this point I wish to express the gratitude of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Cyprus to all those countries\r\nthat have been assisting and supporting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts.\r\nBefore I conclude allow me to refer to a matter which\r\nis of great importance to my Government. This is the issue\r\nof missing persons in Cyprus.\r\nMy Government considers this issue a purely\r\nhumanitarian one whose solution is long overdue. All\r\nefforts should be made so that the legitimate rights of the\r\nfamilies to be informed in a convincing and conclusive\r\nmanner about the fate of their loved ones are fully\r\nrespected by all concerned. This also includes the right to\r\na decent burial for the missing persons who are proved to\r\nbe dead.\r\nIn this spirit, I recently had two meetings in Cyprus\r\nwith the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community,\r\nMr. Rauf Denktash. Certain steps were agreed in the\r\npresence of the resident Deputy Special Representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General that we believe will contribute\r\ntowards the desired progress in the efforts to solve this\r\nhumanitarian problem.\r\nThe hopes and expectations of all — especially the\r\nrelatives of the missing persons — centre on the\r\nimplementation of what was agreed in a true spirit of\r\nhumanitarian principles and practice.\r\nHowever, the agreement I reached with the Turkish\r\nCypriot leader, Mr. Denktash, will prove of little use if the\r\nthird member of the Committee on Missing Persons is not\r\nappointed. It also is my earnest view that the work of the\r\nCommittee on Missing Persons will be greatly assisted and\r\nexpedited if experienced investigators are appointed to\r\nassist it in its task.\r\nIn conclusion, may I reassure the Assembly — and\r\nindeed the world community — of my country’s dedication\r\nto the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter,\r\nas well as emphasize our determination to spare no effort\r\nin working, in concert with other nations, for the prevalence\r\nof justice, peace, progress and stability in the volatile\r\nregion that is our part of the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Cyprus\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call first on the Minister for\r\nForeign and Political Affairs of the Republic of San\r\nMarino, His Excellency Mr. Gabriele Gatti.\r\nMr. Gatti (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): It is my honour to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election and to assure you\r\nof the fullest cooperation of the delegation of San Marino.\r\nMay I thank the outgoing President, His Excellency\r\nMr. Razali Ismail, for his excellent work, and reiterate to\r\nthe Secretary-General the best wishes of the Government\r\nand the people of San Marino for a successful fulfilment\r\nof his mandate. The goals that the United Nations is\r\ncalled upon to achieve are important and demanding, but\r\nalso stimulating.\r\nThese are times of great expectations for the United\r\nNations, and the Republic of San Marino is determined to\r\ndo everything within its power to help translate these\r\nexpectations into concrete and effective actions. We must\r\nrecognize that the United Nations has constantly inspired,\r\npromoted and instilled a greater respect for human rights.\r\nIt has been building a new law of nations.\r\nThe United Nations has made it clear that peace\r\ncannot be achieved and maintained unless serious\r\nimbalances are redressed and all human beings, by virtue\r\nof their fundamental right to dignity, are respected and\r\nnot discriminated against because of their diversity.\r\nEqually essential are access to progress and development\r\nfor all; the equitable utilization of our planet’s resources;\r\nand the avoidance of mere exploitation and abuse, which\r\nwould jeopardize our future beyond repair.\r\nAlthough in recent decades conflicts no longer break\r\nout on a worldwide scale and in some cases take place\r\nwithin national boundaries, they nonetheless continue to\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nclaim innocent victims, cause incalculable damage and\r\nundermine economies, especially those of the less\r\ndeveloped countries. Indeed, the instruments of war have\r\nchanged. They have become increasingly sophisticated and\r\ndestructive and more easily produced and spread. Just think\r\nof anti-personnel landmines; it has been estimated that\r\nmillions of them have been placed throughout the world\r\nand that for each cleared mine, 50 new ones are laid.\r\nIn this connection, I stress the urgent need for all\r\nStates to accede to the recently drafted Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer\r\nof Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\r\nAs regards the fight against terrorism, San Marino is\r\nfollowing with great attention the work of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee charged with drafting an International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. The\r\nproliferation of violence and crime, which have become\r\ntransnational, demands an adequate response by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWith reference to drug trafficking, San Marino is\r\nparticularly active in the field of prevention. This year, our\r\nGovernment launched the “Youth Project”, which consists\r\nof a series of initiatives organized by, and dedicated to,\r\nyoung people, with the purpose of stimulating them to\r\nexploit their creativity and potential in a constructive way.\r\nIn this regard, San Marino supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to convene a special session of the General\r\nAssembly in June 1998 on the traffic in illicit narcotic\r\ndrugs.\r\nSan Marino acknowledges that the Rio Conference\r\nindeed constituted a milestone in the history of our planet\r\nand revealed the magnitude of environmental degradation\r\non Earth. Yet San Marino has observed with bitterness that\r\nconcrete initiatives have fallen short of expectations. This\r\nwas confirmed by the recent special session of the General\r\nAssembly on the review of Agenda 21.\r\nWorthy of praise is the Secretary-General’s proposal\r\nto revitalize the Trusteeship Council by entrusting it with a\r\nmandate of collective environmental safeguard. The\r\nenvironment is a priority concern for the Republic of San\r\nMarino. At the local level, a project is being undertaken for\r\nthe monitoring of the territory which involves students of\r\nvarious school grades under the coordination and\r\nsupervision of teachers. This project aims to enhance our\r\ncitizens’ awareness of the fact that environmental protection\r\nis the responsibility of each and every individual.\r\nIn the field of the prevention and suppression of\r\nchild abuse, San Marino signed the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child and believes that the adoption of\r\ndecisions aimed at defending children against any form of\r\naggression, including sexual abuse, is of paramount\r\nimportance.\r\nSan Marino continues to support the fight against\r\ncapital punishment, in keeping with the fact that it was\r\nthe first European country to abolish it in the mid-\r\nnineteenth century, and it urges other Member States to\r\nadopt concrete measures to eliminate the use of the death\r\npenalty.\r\nAnd we must not forget the exodus of the many\r\nrefugees who are fleeing their countries because of war,\r\nhunger or in the pursuit of the better future to which they\r\nare entitled.\r\nSan Marino, which boasts a tradition of great\r\nhospitality towards refuge-seekers, is deeply concerned\r\nabout the situation observed in refugee camps and their\r\nimpact on local populations. We are grateful to the High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, who daily fulfils this\r\ndemanding task with efficiency.\r\nThe United Nations is adjusting to the process of\r\nchange by establishing the conditions for a concrete\r\nresponse. Its structure, organization and functioning must\r\nbe on exactly the same wavelength as the new reality, and\r\nmust be strong enough to face the challenges of the\r\npresent — and those, even more demanding, of the\r\ncoming third millennium. For this reason we appreciate\r\nthe work already done by the Secretary-General and urge\r\nhim to continue this essential process of renewal of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe United Nations reform package proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General is a good basis for a realistic and\r\neffective response with a view to reaching the lofty goals\r\nof the Organization: peace, social and economic progress,\r\nand safeguard of the rights of both individuals and\r\npeoples. Member States will be able to focus better on\r\nthese goals by solving, first of all, the United Nations\r\nfinancial crisis. To do this, a new and more equitable\r\nscale of assessments is necessary, along with cost-cutting,\r\nthe elimination or reduction of bodies and services where\r\nappropriate, and, most important, the avoidance of overlap\r\nwith other organizations, including at the regional level.\r\nSmall countries are particularly aware of this issue, since\r\nit is increasingly difficult for them to guarantee their\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nparticipation and contribution — and not only in financial\r\nterms.\r\nSan Marino has given great attention to all proposals\r\nfor the reform of the Security Council put forward by\r\nnumerous countries during the debate. All of them are\r\nequally important and constitute an essential basis for the\r\nformulation of well-considered, comprehensive solutions.\r\nHowever, it is essential that participation in the conception\r\nand implementation of this restructuring not be confined to\r\nlarger States. The future configuration of the United\r\nNations should reflect a community of 185 countries, each\r\nand every one of them independent and sovereign according\r\nto the principles of universality and equality. Those are\r\namong the reasons that have led San Marino to support an\r\nincrease in the number of non-permanent seats on the\r\nSecurity Council — though, and I stress this point once\r\nmore, this is not the only issue.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations does not consist of\r\nbeing present in major or minor bodies, but rather of\r\nshaping the future together through the understanding,\r\nparticipation, awareness, involvement and support of all.\r\nWe shall shape a future where universal peace is\r\nguaranteed and safeguarded by the United Nations.\r\nSan Marino is convinced that the United Nations must\r\nfulfil both a monitoring and a protecting mandate, on the\r\none hand in favour of individuals whose rights and\r\nfreedoms are limited or denied by their own States, and on\r\nthe other in favour of those countries, especially smaller\r\nones, whose development could be hampered or influenced.\r\nIn this regard I wish to underline how all countries\r\nand the United Nations itself could benefit from the role\r\nplayed by small States, which can make a significant\r\ncontribution to major issues as well, since they have no\r\nmilitary, political or economic interests but rather a heritage\r\nof ideals, culture and traditions to safeguard.\r\nMay these objectives be fully attained as the United\r\nNations approaches the third millennium.\r\nThe President: I call next on His Excellency Mr.\r\nEldar Kouliev, Chairman of the Delegation of Azerbaijan.\r\nMr. Kouliev (Azerbaijan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me first of all, Sir, to congratulate you\r\nsincerely on your unanimous election to the post of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\r\nsession, and to express our confidence that under your wise\r\nand able guidance this session will successfully cope with\r\nall its historic tasks. Your election to that high and\r\nresponsible post is further evidence of the burgeoning\r\nimage of independent Ukraine, with which Azerbaijan\r\nenjoys an especially friendly relationship, and of its\r\nsubstantial contribution to the work of the Organization.\r\nI would also like to address special appreciation to\r\nMr. Razali Ismail, whose innovative approach and high\r\nprofessionalism to a large extent facilitated the success of\r\nthe last session and showed the irreversible nature of the\r\nradical process of reforming the Organization with a view\r\nto strengthening its effectiveness.\r\nFor the past six years, the Republic of Armenia has\r\ncontinued its aggression against my country. Aiming to\r\ntear away and seize part of the territory of Azerbaijan, the\r\nRepublic of Armenia initiated and sponsored a separatist\r\nmovement in the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.\r\nHere it was gambling with the high principle of the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples and completely ignoring the\r\nprinciples of territorial integrity and the inviolability of\r\nborders. Subsequently, as members know, the Republic of\r\nArmenia resorted to armed aggression against the\r\nAzerbaijani Republic, occupying a considerable part of\r\nAzerbaijan and leaving about a million people without\r\nshelter.\r\nTheir later invention, the so-called Republic of\r\nNagorny Karabakh, is nothing but a tactical trick in the\r\nstrategy of Armenian politicians, which is to attach the\r\nNagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic to\r\nthe Republic of Armenia. The international community\r\nrejected this policy through Security Council resolutions\r\n822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993),\r\nwhich reaffirmed that the Nagorny Karabakh region is a\r\npart of Azerbaijan.\r\nThe 1996 Lisbon summit of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) put forward\r\nthree principles for the settlement of the Armenia-\r\nAzerbaijan conflict. These were: the territorial integrity of\r\nthe Republic of Armenia and of the Azerbaijani Republic;\r\ndefinition of the legal status of Nagorny Karabakh\r\nthrough an agreement based on self-determination and\r\nconferring on Nagorny Karabakh the highest degree of\r\nself-rule within Azerbaijan; and guaranteed security for\r\nNagorny Karabakh and its entire population, including\r\nmutual obligations to ensure compliance by all the parties\r\nwith the provisions of the settlement.\r\nArmenia was the only country out of 54 OSCE\r\nmember States that rejected those principles. While\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nspeaking in favour of a peaceful settlement of the conflict\r\nat the earliest possible date, the Republic of Armenia\r\nreceived, during the period 1993 to 1996, a vast amount of\r\nRussian weaponry, far exceeding its requirements, including\r\ntanks, armoured vehicles and SCUD missiles, worth $1\r\nbillion. This clearly demonstrates that that country has not\r\nyet given up its aggressive plans.\r\nIn an address to permanent representatives of United\r\nNations Member States during a visit to United Nations\r\nHeadquarters last August, the President of Azerbaijan, Mr.\r\nHeydar Aliyev, stated that Azerbaijan had been and would\r\ncontinue to be in favour of a peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict. Azerbaijan is ready to provide the Armenian\r\npopulation of the Nagorny Karabakh region with the\r\nbroadest possible autonomy, in accordance with world\r\nstandards, but it will never submit to seizure of part of its\r\nterritory or allow a second Armenian State to be created at\r\nthe expense of its own land.\r\nAzerbaijan supported proposals submitted in\r\nSeptember by the Co-Chairmen of the OSCE Minsk\r\nConference, the United States, Russia and France. The\r\nelaboration of a draft agreement on cessation of the armed\r\nconflict on the basis of those proposals would create a solid\r\nfoundation for achieving a breakthrough in the process of\r\nfinding a settlement to the Armenia-Azerbaijan armed\r\nconflict.\r\nThe reform package for the United Nations proposed\r\nby the Secretary-General is a serious and fundamental\r\ndocument. Azerbaijan welcomes his report (A/51/950) as a\r\nreal basis for conducting reforms in order to adapt the\r\nUnited Nations to today’s rapidly changing demands and\r\nmake it better prepared to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century. Azerbaijan is prepared to cooperate\r\nwith all Member States and with the Secretary-General and\r\nhis reform team in order to achieve the goal that has been\r\nset.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s realistic\r\nassessment that the main aim of the present reform is to\r\nnarrow the gap between the aspirations and achievements\r\nof the United Nations. We think that establishing the\r\nposition of Deputy Secretary-General, setting up a Senior\r\nManagement Group, creating a Strategic Planning Unit and\r\nstrengthening the executive committees of the sectoral\r\ngroups, together with a number of other suggestions,\r\nconstitute an interesting and comprehensive approach that\r\nwill ensure the harmonious management and functioning of\r\nthis Organization as it tackles the new and complex tasks\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nWe are of the view that, given the numerous\r\npressing problems, the maintenance of peace and security\r\nthroughout the world must continue to be the main\r\nmission of our Organization. In this regard, Azerbaijan\r\nwelcomes and supports the Secretary-General’s ideas on\r\nstrengthening the potential of the United Nations in post-\r\nconflict peace-building, with the Department of Political\r\nAffairs as the focal point for this.\r\nThis matter is integrally linked to the issue of\r\nadvancing the disarmament agenda. Accordingly, the idea\r\nof establishing a Department for Disarmament and Arms\r\nRegulation, which would address the reduction and\r\nregulation of armaments and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, deserves every support.\r\nWith regard to disarmament as a whole, I would like\r\nto dwell on the urgent problem of the proliferation of\r\nconventional arms. The lack of norms regulating\r\nconventional arms causes serious concern. One cannot but\r\nagree with the Secretary-General when he says that such\r\na situation creates a vicious circle, in that Member States\r\nseek assistance in the settlement of armed conflicts, while\r\nthere is tough competition over arms exports, including\r\nexports to conflict areas where the United Nations is\r\nseeking to restore peace. All of this leads to the further\r\nescalation and prolongation of conflicts.\r\nThe expansion of the Security Council is a pressing,\r\nacute and complex issue. We believe that any increase in\r\nthe number of permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil must be confined to countries with the capacity\r\nand will to assume global responsibility, including\r\nfinancial responsibility, for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and stability. In this context, Azerbaijan has\r\non several occasions spoken in favour of the candidatures\r\nof Germany and Japan, which in our view meet those\r\nrequirements.\r\nAn increase in the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council should restore the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographic allocation of seats for all\r\nregional groups. In this connection, Azerbaijan supports\r\nan increase in the number of non-permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council from the Group of Eastern European\r\nStates, given that membership of the Group has doubled\r\nin the past five years. We believe that one non-permanent\r\nseat for our Group in the Security Council does not\r\nreflect the current state of affairs and is not\r\ncommensurate with the role played by the members of the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nGroup in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nAzerbaijan also supports the approach taken to the\r\nquestion of equitable representation of Asian, African, Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States in the Council. The issue of\r\nthe total number of permanent and non-permanent members\r\nof the Security Council should first be addressed from the\r\nperspective of maintaining and upgrading the efficiency of\r\nthe Council.\r\nWe fully support the Secretary-General’s idea that one\r\nof the main directions for United Nations reform must be\r\nto strengthen United Nations activities in the area of\r\ncoordination of international cooperation for development.\r\nWe are convinced that at a time when the question of\r\nmore rational use of United Nations resources, including\r\nfinancial resources, has become a priority, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s decision to focus on the activities that the United\r\nNations can best carry out, from the standpoint both of\r\nusing existing intellectual potential and of meeting the\r\nrequirements of a large group of members of the\r\ninternational community, is very wise.\r\nThe Azerbaijani Republic greatly appreciates the\r\nnature and results of its cooperation with the United\r\nNations system in the area of socio-economic development.\r\nSince our country joined the United Nations, dozens of\r\nlarge-scale development projects have been implemented in\r\nAzerbaijan with help from United Nations specialized\r\nagencies. These projects have had a positive impact on the\r\nall-round transformation of Azerbaijani society. I would like\r\nto make particular mention of the establishment of a free\r\neconomic zone in the third largest city of Azerbaijan,\r\nSumgait, and the programme to rehabilitate the territories\r\nof Azerbaijan liberated from Armenian occupation.\r\nWe welcome the idea of establishing a United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group, and we believe that strengthening\r\ncoordination in the activities of the various agencies will\r\nadd to the efficiency of the operational development\r\nactivities of the Organization. Among the factors that could\r\nhelp us achieve this goal are the elaboration of a\r\ncomprehensive strategy for the activities of specialized\r\nagencies vis-à-vis the recipient countries, the elimination of\r\noverlap in functions and programmes, a renewed\r\nconcentration on priorities, and the improvement of\r\npartnership mechanisms with State institutions and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations of Member States.\r\nBut all these good wishes and hopes may prove to\r\nbe simply an unattainable dream if they are not\r\naccompanied by a relevant resource base. In this respect,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan’s idea of creating a new system for\r\nmobilizing core resources for development purposes,\r\nthrough voluntary contributions and negotiated pledges\r\nthat would be made available in multi-year tranches, is to\r\nbe commended and supported. We are convinced that it\r\nis necessary to provide the broadest possible mandate for\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposed Office for Development\r\nFinancing.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal to\r\ndeepen and expand the partnership between the United\r\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions with a view\r\nto strengthening cooperation and increasing the\r\nrationalization and coordination of activities. In recent\r\nyears Azerbaijan has accumulated considerable experience\r\nthrough fruitful cooperation with the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). Thanks to this\r\ncooperation it has been possible to improve the overall\r\neconomic situation in the Republic, to curb rampant\r\ninflation and restore economic growth.\r\nReforming the structure of the Secretariat\r\ndepartments dealing with social and economic matters and\r\nconferring new functions on the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil are, in our view, logical elements of the\r\ncomprehensive reform programme proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nAt the same time, it is obvious that reform will not\r\nproduce the best results if the finances of the\r\nOrganization are not put into good order. Given this fact,\r\nwe understand the proposal for the establishment, as a\r\ntemporary measure until the Organization’s financial\r\nsituation is on a solid basis, of a Revolving Credit Fund\r\nwith initial capital of up to $1 billion financed from\r\nvoluntary contributions or other means that Member\r\nStates may wish to suggest. In this connection we also\r\nfully support the Secretary-General’s proposal to open a\r\ndevelopment account.\r\nWe are also firmly convinced that reforming the\r\npersonnel policy of the United Nations should be an\r\ninseparable part of the reform. We are deeply concerned\r\nby the fact that even today Azerbaijan is still not\r\nrepresented in the Secretariat.\r\nIn recent years the world has been overwhelmed by\r\na wave of extraordinary situations resulting from armed\r\nconflict, natural disasters and economic crises. As a\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nconsequence of these situations millions of people have lost\r\ntheir homes, been deprived of food and basic living\r\nconditions and have become refugees and displaced\r\npersons. This issue is of particular relevance to Azerbaijan,\r\nas refugees and displaced persons in the Republic are in\r\ndire need of emergency humanitarian assistance. Recently,\r\nseveral regions of Azerbaijan suffered flooding as a result\r\nof continuous rainfall, which inflicted serious damage on\r\nthe economy and the people. Azerbaijan greatly appreciates\r\nthe humanitarian activities of the United Nations aimed at\r\nprotecting and saving the victims of armed conflict and\r\nnatural disasters.\r\nWe fully endorse the idea contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report that humanitarian actions today extend\r\nbeyond the mere provision of relief and also entail early\r\nwarning, prevention, advocacy and rehabilitation as well as\r\nassistance for transition to long-term development. At the\r\nsame time we hope that structural changes — such as the\r\ncreation of the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator\r\nto replace the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the\r\nmobilizing of its efforts to deal more effectively with\r\ncomplex emergencies — will not result in a decrease in\r\nhumanitarian assistance for single recipient countries that\r\nare faced with the consequences of armed conflicts, foreign\r\naggression and occupation and that have hundreds of\r\nthousands — even millions — of refugees and displaced\r\npersons.\r\nThis also applies to the suggested reforms of the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), of whose\r\nExecutive Board Azerbaijan is a member. We believe it\r\nnecessary to maintain the independence of UNICEF in the\r\nareas of fund-raising and contacts with donors to ensure\r\ncontributions for funding the programmes of the\r\norganization and accountability to donors with regard to\r\nhow the funds are spent. We consider it important that the\r\nspecialized agencies continue to have specific goals and\r\nmechanisms to achieve those goals. At the same time we\r\nsupport the proposals regarding a common starting point,\r\nclose coordination and interaction, and the adoption of\r\nmeasures to avoid overlap and the dissipation of resources.\r\nUNICEF’s mandate includes not only the development\r\nof children, but their protection and survival. The United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, together with such entities as the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees and the World Food Programme, becomes\r\nactively involved in saving the lives of children in\r\nemergencies. There is an effective mechanism for\r\ninteraction between UNICEF and humanitarian\r\norganizations, donors, Governments and local and\r\ninternational non-governmental organizations. We hope\r\nthat the establishment of the United Nations Development\r\nGroup will not weaken but, on the contrary, strengthen\r\nthis function of UNICEF.\r\nWe support the idea of common premises for United\r\nNations missions at the country level, to be called “UN\r\nHouse”. This would certainly encourage closer and more\r\neffective interaction between specialized agencies and\r\nUnited Nations programmes. As for Resident\r\nCoordinators, we believe it would be expedient to select\r\nthem from representatives of all interested organizations.\r\nA mechanism such as rotation should be worked out for\r\nthis. We also support the idea of convening joint\r\ncommittees and consecutive meetings of relevant\r\nexecutive boards.\r\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, it is high time\r\nto consolidate the efforts of all countries for a resolute\r\nattack on crime, drug abuse and terrorism. Organized\r\nunderworld groups that enjoy access to sophisticated\r\ntechnologies and weaponry are challenging law and order\r\nas well as economic, political and other institutions, not\r\nonly in individual countries but in entire regions and\r\nthroughout the world. The United Nations must be at the\r\nforefront of the battle to curtail the activities of such\r\ngroups. At the same time, we need to ensure that the\r\nefforts of the international community are centralized if\r\nwe are to succeed in crushing crime and drug abuse. In\r\nthis context we support the idea of uniting the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme with a\r\nnew Centre for International Crime Prevention to create\r\na new Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, to\r\nbe located in Vienna.\r\nEnsuring human rights remains one of the most\r\nimportant of the Organization’s fields of activity. It is\r\nespecially urgent today when the issue of human rights\r\npermeates all aspects of public life and is equally relevant\r\nto all countries and all regions of the world. Human rights\r\nare closely connected with political, economic, social and\r\nother processes. The events of recent years have\r\ndemonstrated that expansionist actions on the part of\r\nsome States, aggressive separatism and economic\r\ndifficulties deprive States of their ability adequately to\r\ndefend and ensure the human rights of their citizens. That\r\nis why the United Nations will have to strengthen its\r\nactivities, exposing and neutralizing the factors that lead\r\nto human rights abuse. We approve in particular of the\r\nmeasures recommended by the Secretary-General with\r\nregard to existing or potential conflicts or post-conflict\r\nsituations affecting human rights.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nWe believe it right to suggest that the issue of human\r\nrights must be considered to an equal degree in all four\r\nsubstantive fields of the Secretariat’s work programme:\r\npeace and security, economic and social affairs,\r\ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian affairs. In the\r\ncontext of enhancing the work of the Organization’s\r\ndivisions in the field of human rights, we commend the\r\nconsolidation of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human\r\nRights into a single Office of the High Commissioner. This\r\nwill strengthen that entity and lay the groundwork for more\r\nefficient use of available human and financial resources.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report “Renewing the United\r\nNations: A Programme for Reform” (A/51/950) is a\r\ncomprehensive and far-reaching set of changes aimed at\r\noverhauling the Organization. The quintessential idea of the\r\nreport that reform should constitute a continuous and steady\r\nprocess, not a quick fix, is of particular significance.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to point out that the\r\nsuggested measures and recommendations are aimed both\r\nat creating new structures of leadership and management\r\nand at harmonizing the activities of all bodies of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency The\r\nHonourable Billie Miller, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Tourism and International\r\nTransport of Barbados.\r\nMrs. Miller (Barbados): Mr. President, it is my\r\npleasure to congratulate you on your election, to share the\r\nconfidence expressed in your leadership, and to pledge the\r\ncooperation of the Barbados delegation in the work of the\r\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly.\r\nI also wish to convey our deep appreciation to His\r\nExcellency Ambassador Razali Ismail for his outstanding\r\nstewardship of the fifty-first session. My delegation\r\nwelcomed the firm management and dispatch of the\r\nGeneral Assembly agenda which characterized his tenure as\r\nPresident. We would wish that this businesslike approach\r\nreflect the new direction of a reformed United Nations,\r\nmore efficient and more effective, to face the challenge of\r\nrapid global change.\r\nThe Assembly meets again for its review of the global\r\npolitical scene against a background of recurring strife and\r\nconflict in many parts of the world. The increasing\r\ndemands on the resources of the Organization continue to\r\nhamper implementation of its priority mission in the post-\r\ncold-war world, namely, promoting sustainable\r\ndevelopment and, in particular, the elimination of absolute\r\npoverty.\r\nMy delegation believes that the United Nations must\r\nremain the conscience of the international community in\r\nthe fight against poverty and misery, which afflict so\r\nmany of the world’s people. Yet we face the stark reality\r\nthat without peace, the fruits of development and the\r\ngoals of economic and social justice will remain for them\r\na distant dream.\r\nThe numerous conflicts, both old and new, which\r\ndarken the global political scene underline the need for a\r\nnew urgency in the quest for peace, so wherever conflict\r\nexists we call on all concerned parties to redouble their\r\nefforts towards reconciliation and to accelerate the\r\nconditions for stability and economic and social progress\r\nfor their people.\r\nBut, as we look to the new millennium, we believe\r\nthat prospects for an era of lasting peace must extend\r\nbeyond traditional responses to conflict after they have\r\nerupted. The promotion of a “Culture of Peace”, launched\r\nby the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), holds considerable promise. It\r\nfocuses greater attention on prevention and addresses the\r\ncause of conflict at its roots. We share the view of\r\nUNESCO that this challenge is broad and far-reaching\r\nand would require priority commitment by the United\r\nNations system, non-governmental organizations, and civil\r\nsociety.\r\nInstitutional reform and restructuring at both the\r\nnational and multilateral levels in response to rapid global\r\nchange is an imperative, not an option. Barbados strongly\r\nsupports the United Nations reform process, and has\r\nfollowed with deep interest the progress of the various\r\nWorking Groups.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe Working Group on an Agenda for Development\r\nhas completed its task. We now have a comprehensive\r\ndocument which embodies the main development\r\npriorities contained in the various programmes of action.\r\nBut if the Agenda is to be implemented, it must claim\r\nwide ownership, not only among the organs and\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system, but\r\namong the operational Ministries of Governments as\r\nwell — in particular, Ministries of Finance. Here we\r\nremain concerned that the critical question of the future\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nfinancing of development has not been resolved. This has\r\nheightened uncertainty about the international commitment\r\nto development cooperation, through which the United\r\nNations system has played such an important supportive\r\nrole in developing countries.\r\nNegotiations taking place in the Working Group on\r\nreform of the Security Council should facilitate, not limit,\r\nopportunities for membership of developing countries, and\r\nreflect the altered structure of the Organization since 1965.\r\nBarbados attaches particular importance to the principle of\r\nopenness and transparency in the work of the Council and\r\nwelcomes the steps already taken in this direction through\r\nregular briefings and monthly assessments by Council\r\nPresidents.\r\nDifficult negotiations remain on key issues, including\r\nthe size of the Council, the nature of its enlargement and\r\nthe use of the veto. We must now step up consultations,\r\ndrawing on the useful proposals submitted by Member\r\nStates and the Co-Chairmen of the Group. We hope such\r\nnegotiations can be conducted in a timely and open manner,\r\nin a spirit of compromise, and to the general satisfaction of\r\nall.\r\nThe report on the strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem contains many important recommendations for\r\nimproving the role and functioning of the General\r\nAssembly and the accountability and efficiency of the\r\nSecretariat. Some may argue that these proposals do not go\r\nfar enough. In the view of my delegation, however, they\r\nconstitute a firm basis on which the effectiveness of these\r\norgans can be built. We look forward to their\r\nimplementation.\r\nMy delegation remains deeply concerned about the\r\nprolonged financial crisis facing the Organization and the\r\nserious implications for its long-term viability. We believe\r\nthat the United Nations is at the crossroads. Payment of\r\nassessed contributions in full, on time and without\r\nconditions is a hallowed treaty obligation of Member States.\r\nUnilateral conditions, however convenient, constitute a\r\ndangerous precedent which could hobble the United Nations\r\nand the reform process for many years to come. We urge\r\nthe Working Group concerned to step up its efforts to put\r\nthe Organization on a more secure financial footing.\r\nAgainst this background of United Nations system\r\nreform, we welcome the second phase of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform programme “Renewing the United\r\nNations: A Programme for Reform”. It contains many far-\r\nreaching proposals designed to streamline the organizational\r\nand management structure of the United Nations and to\r\nimprove its overall effectiveness. My delegation will\r\nparticipate actively in the relevant forum which will\r\nconsider this report, and seek greater clarification and\r\nspecificity on a number of key recommendations.\r\nIn principle, however, we believe that as chief\r\nexecutive officer, accountable to Member States for the\r\nOrganization’s performance, the Secretary-General must\r\nbe able to implement those management actions within\r\nhis immediate authority. At the same time, we would\r\ncaution that reform should not be driven by staff\r\nreduction targets, nor predetermined by budgetary\r\nconstraints. We believe reform should be guided by the\r\nmandated objectives and priorities set by Member States,\r\nas reflected in the various programmes of action of the\r\nglobal conferences, and the financial and human resources\r\nrequired to implement them.\r\nThe scientific achievements of this century have\r\nbeen truly spectacular. We have visited the Moon and\r\nlived in outer space for months. We have made great\r\nadvances in medicine and genetic engineering, in\r\ninformation technology, in high-speed mass transport and\r\nin food production, to mention only a few. Yet so much\r\nremains to be done. Abject poverty, disease, illiteracy and\r\nill-health still afflict far too many fellow inhabitants of\r\nthis planet as we approach the new millennium.\r\nThis Organization has done much to alleviate\r\nsuffering. But it can continue to do so, and do so more\r\neffectively, only if Member States, according to their\r\ncapacities, give unselfishly of the financial and technical\r\nresources necessary for the execution of its social\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIn Barbados, our own national development\r\nprogrammes underscore the Government’s assignment of\r\nhighest priority to the social sectors, which at present\r\naccount for almost 40 per cent of total Government\r\nexpenditure. Through sustained economic growth,\r\nsupplemented by an effective social safety net, the\r\nGovernment aims to spread the benefits of development\r\nto all its people. Among new major programmes are Edu\r\ntech 2000, a five-year education-sector programme aimed\r\nat enhancing the use of information technology by\r\nstudents and teachers, and the Youth Entrepreneurship\r\nScheme, known as YES, which provides training,\r\nbusiness counselling, mentorship and access to finance for\r\nyoung entrepreneurs.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nWhile our strong commitment to social policy has paid\r\nrich dividends, as illustrated by the successive high\r\nrankings of Barbados in the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) human development index, emerging\r\nproblems largely associated with poverty, particularly\r\namong youth, are of critical concern.\r\nThe Government has therefore launched a major\r\ninitiative in collaboration with UNDP to elaborate a plan of\r\naction for poverty alleviation including the feasibility of a\r\nsocial-investment funding scheme. It will target pockets of\r\npoverty throughout the country and provide funding for\r\nprogrammes submitted by local non-governmental\r\norganizations and community groups, focusing on skills\r\nacquisition and community empowerment. Through related\r\npolicies, the Government is implementing measures to\r\npromote gender parity and the full integration of women\r\nand youth in the development process.\r\nBarbados enjoys a robust democracy and so recognizes\r\nthe increasing influence of civil society in shaping national\r\npolicy. The Government has taken a number of actions to\r\nfoster and to strengthen this participatory process, including\r\nthe establishment of National Commissions on Social\r\nJustice and on Reform of the Constitution. This underscores\r\nthe highest priority we give to social justice and democracy\r\nand the importance we attach to keeping these fundamental\r\nrights under periodic review.\r\nBarbados participated actively within the Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States (AOSIS) during the nineteenth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly, which reviewed the\r\noutcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development. We consider the Rio Conference to be\r\none of the great achievements of the United Nations. It\r\nunderscored the integration of environment and\r\ndevelopment policies through a comprehensive programme\r\nof action — Agenda 21 — which speaks to the very\r\nsurvival of our planet. More particularly, it called the\r\nattention of the international community to the special\r\nvulnerabilities of small island developing States through the\r\nfollow-up Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of the Small Island Developing States, and\r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action which it adopted.\r\nBarbados shared with other developing countries the\r\nexpectation that the special session would rekindle the spirit\r\nof Rio and reaffirm the commitments made for the\r\nfinancing of sustainable development. The special session\r\nclearly fell short of these expectations. Since Rio, progress\r\nhas been made in enacting international law and\r\nconventions in the areas of biodiversity, the seas, climate\r\nchange and desertification, and in implementing\r\nenvironmental policies at the national level. But the\r\nfailure of donors to honour commitments on finance and\r\ntechnology was clearly the most crucial factor limiting\r\nfurther implementation of Agenda 21.\r\nWe welcome, however, the decision to hold a two-\r\nday special session to review the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction in 1999. It is our hope that this review will\r\nreinforce the long-term viability of this Programme and\r\nunderscore the vital role small island developing States\r\nplay as a laboratory for the study of environmental\r\nchange in the interest of all countries. While recognizing\r\nthat, through self-help, small island developing States\r\nmust do more to revitalize the Barbados Programme, we\r\nurge the international community to provide greater\r\nfinancial support to strengthen its implementation,\r\nespecially its information network and technical assistance\r\ncomponents. The upcoming Caribbean ministerial meeting\r\non the plan of action, scheduled to be held in Barbados in\r\nNovember, will give strategic direction to our preparatory\r\nwork over the next several months.\r\nI wish to turn briefly to specific developments of\r\nmajor concern to the Caribbean region. The vulnerability\r\nof our region, both environmental and economic, is a\r\ndaily reality. On the emerald isle of Montserrat, nature\r\nhas dealt a most cruel blow. There the people face not\r\njust the effects of a natural calamity, but the distinct\r\npossibility that their island home and way of life could be\r\nobliterated. The eruption of the Lange Soufriere Hills\r\nVolcano shows no signs of abating. Barbados has joined\r\nits Caribbean Community (CARICOM) partners in\r\nproviding financial and material assistance to the people\r\nof our sister isle in this time of crisis. We urge the\r\ninternational community to come to the assistance of this\r\nbeleaguered island.\r\nMan-made disasters can be no less cruel. The recent\r\ndecision of the World Trade Organization panel on the\r\nbanana question has threatened the very lifeline of the\r\nexporting countries of the region. We know that\r\ndiversification is the long-term answer. But such\r\neconomic transformation cannot be achieved overnight or\r\nwithout consistent support from the international\r\ncommunity. Barbados joins affected countries in appealing\r\nfor such support.\r\nLast June Barbados and the other CARICOM States\r\nwelcomed Haiti as the fourteenth member of our\r\nCommunity. Haiti’s future is now linked to CARICOM’s\r\nfuture.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nIn supporting Haiti during its critical hour, CARICOM\r\ncountries cautioned then, and we do so again now, that the\r\ntask ahead would be long and difficult and that progress\r\nwould be uneven, and urged the international community to\r\nstay the course with Haiti. We are therefore grateful not\r\njust to the Security Council for agreeing to a United\r\nNations Transition Mission in Haiti whose mandate extends\r\nto 30 November 1997, but also to the Friends of the\r\nSecretary-General for Haiti, and to other concerned\r\ndelegations that made this compromise possible. This\r\nextension will further professionalize the National Police\r\nforce and enhance its capacity to secure the stability on\r\nwhich democracy and development can flourish.\r\nIn May 1997 Barbados had the honour to host the\r\nCARICOM/United States summit on partnership for\r\nprosperity and security in the Caribbean. It underlined our\r\nmutual economic and security interests and opened a new\r\nchapter in the CARICOM/United States partnership,\r\nconsistent with the changing global economy.\r\nThe summit adopted the Bridgetown Declaration of\r\nPrinciples. It will guide an ambitious action plan designed\r\nto promote sustainable development and foster democracy,\r\npeace, and economic and social progress in the region.\r\nBarbados considers the summit an important landmark in\r\nCARICOM/United States cooperation. We look forward to\r\nmonitoring the action plan at annual meetings of\r\nCARICOM Foreign Ministers and the Secretary of State of\r\nthe United States of America, starting early in 1998. We\r\ntrust that this process of consultation will embrace the\r\nconcerns of Caribbean countries over a number of critical\r\nissues, such as the adverse impact of recent immigration\r\npolicy on the very fabric of Caribbean society.\r\nBarbados and the CARICOM States have been\r\nparticularly concerned with the threat to democracy and\r\nsociety posed by drug trafficking, crime and violence,\r\nmoney laundering and corruption. Our efforts to rid the\r\nCaribbean of those scourges have centred on increased\r\ncooperation and information sharing and on the\r\nstrengthening and training of our police and coastguard\r\nforces. We welcome the valuable support for these efforts\r\nby our bilateral partners as well as by the Regional Office\r\nfor the Caribbean of the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme. The special session of the General\r\nAssembly on the issue of drugs next year will provide a\r\nvaluable opportunity to share our experiences and also to\r\nlearn from those of others.\r\nLet me comment briefly on the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization, which has reshaped the development\r\nlandscape, with far-reaching implications for the\r\nCaribbean Community. The reordering and strengthening\r\nof CARICOM-United States cooperation are an integral\r\npart of our adaptation to this powerful impulse. Through\r\nthe liberalization of trade, finance and services and the\r\nrapid expansion of telecommunications and information\r\ntechnology, developing countries have become a driving\r\nforce in this process, although the level and pace of\r\nintegration differ widely among countries. Barbados\r\nshares the anxiety of small developing States, which are\r\nhighly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely\r\ncompetitive environment given our sparse natural and\r\nhuman-resource base and limited administrative and\r\ntechnical capacity.\r\nGlobalization presents new opportunities for trade\r\nand investment — witness the performance of East Asian\r\neconomies. But the gains have been largely reaped by the\r\nstronger countries, leaving the weak even more\r\ndisadvantaged and the inequality between and within\r\ncountries even more pronounced. It is for this reason that\r\nwe urge the United Nations to play a greater advocacy\r\nrole on behalf of vulnerable States in the policy dialogue\r\non globalization.\r\nThe CARICOM States recognize that we must\r\nstrengthen our technical capacity to negotiate effectively\r\nour integration into the global economy. Accordingly,\r\nregional negotiating machinery has been established to\r\nmanage these crucial negotiations, which will determine\r\nour future relations with major trading blocs.\r\nThis fifty-second session of the General Assembly\r\nhas before it many critical issues. It must guide the\r\nreform process, which, in effect, will determine the very\r\nfuture of the Organization. It must come to terms with the\r\nchronic and grave financial crisis that threatens the\r\nOrganization’s integrity and viability. It must redouble its\r\nefforts to foster reconciliation and stability in the many\r\nstrife-torn countries where millions of people remain\r\ntrapped in poverty and deprivation.\r\nBarbados believes that this indispensable institution\r\ncan meet these challenges. But it must expeditiously put\r\nits house in order so that it can intensify its efforts with\r\nregard to the priorities that define its unique mission of\r\npeace, development, democracy and social justice.\r\nBarbados pledges its full commitment and support.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the Chairman of the delegation of Djibouti,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye.\r\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti): I wish to extend to the\r\nPresident the warm congratulations of my delegation on his\r\nelection to preside over the fifty-second session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are on the verge of what may be a\r\ndefining moment in the direction and capabilities of the\r\nOrganization. His vast diplomatic experience assures us that\r\nat this moment the reins will indeed be in very capable\r\nhands.\r\nWe must also deeply thank his predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the high level\r\nof relevance, focus and commitment achieved at the fifty-\r\nfirst session under his bold and astute stewardship as\r\nPresident. His forthright appraisals of the critical issues\r\nfacing the Organization, particularly the extraordinary\r\nimpetus he injected into the question of the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, will be felt well into the next millennium.\r\nWe are also very pleased to offer our sincere\r\ncongratulations to the new Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan. In less than a year since assuming that high\r\nresponsibility he has already brought his considerable\r\nexperience and vision to bear on the operations of the\r\nUnited Nations. Throughout his long and faithful service\r\nwith the United Nations he has demonstrated a keen\r\nawareness of the need for a strong and responsive\r\nOrganization. His all-encompassing reform proposals go a\r\nlong way towards realizing a dream that has often eluded\r\nus in the past. We are confident he will persevere in his\r\nonerous task of keeping the Organization afloat.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization is an excellent starting point for an overview\r\nof the principal issues confronting mankind today. On the\r\none hand, there are widespread ripple effects emanating\r\nfrom the end of the cold war, the advent of a single global\r\nmarket and the trend towards democratization and respect\r\nfor human rights. On the other hand, there are the ominous\r\ntrends towards the fragmentation of societies, the search for\r\nnew identities and the consequent spread of civil strife and\r\nconflict. Today, therefore, the need to deal with post-\r\nconflict situations is as critical as the need to prevent them.\r\nThere is now universal recognition that much of this\r\nconflict is the result of the widespread poverty and severe\r\nunderdevelopment facing many societies.\r\nFor an economy to overcome poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment it must today participate in the global\r\neconomy, which has become a driving force in the world.\r\nThe 1997 World Economic and Social Survey suggests\r\nthat all developing countries and countries with\r\neconomies in transition need to raise per capita income by\r\nat least 3 per cent annually. To achieve that, however, the\r\nSurvey contends, and the Secretary-General agrees, the\r\nless affluent countries, in particular, require a more\r\nconducive external economic environment than now exists\r\nfor them.\r\nThe elements that until quite recently served to\r\ndefine our world have dramatically and rapidly changed.\r\nThe predominant concerns of global atomic warfare and\r\nthe cold war and the destructive policies of colonialism\r\nand apartheid have quickly given way to the challenges of\r\npoverty, globalism and development. This has created an\r\nunprecedented demand for the services of the United\r\nNations at a time when it is facing critical challenges in\r\na world of revolutionary change.\r\nTo remain relevant, the United Nations must carry\r\nout fundamental structural adjustments or changes, which\r\ncan no longer be addressed through ad hoc, piecemeal\r\nreforms. A coordinated, top-down, comprehensive reform\r\nof the entire edifice is necessary to overhaul and\r\nstreamline the Secretariat; create a new organizational\r\nculture and focus; consolidate functions; do away with\r\noverlapping programmes and duplications; eliminate\r\nfinancial waste; mobilize new resources for development;\r\nand strengthen and enhance coordination of United\r\nNations operations at the field level. The savings derived\r\nfrom such rationalizations, trimming of inefficiencies and\r\nadministrative costs could be directed to development for\r\neconomic and social activities. These, it seems, are\r\nprecisely the aims of the Secretary-General’s extensive\r\nand far-reaching proposals, issued under the title\r\n“Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for\r\nReform”. They are a serious and bold set of proposals\r\nthat deserve our utmost consideration. Djibouti fully\r\nsupports the proposals and endorses their implementation\r\nas a package.\r\nThe General Assembly at this session has\r\ndemonstrated overwhelming support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform proposals, particularly in their design as\r\nan integrated package. They should be considered as such\r\nby this plenary. It would be helpful to look at the\r\nproposals as the United Nations equivalent of the World\r\nBank’s new Strategic Compact. Each initiative is intended\r\nto take its respective organization into the next\r\nmillennium by bringing about a fundamental renewal of\r\nthe institution.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nWe know that every element of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s package may not generate agreement across the\r\nboard. Divergences of views are bound to occur and are to\r\nbe expected. Indeed, genuine fears, even scepticism, have\r\nbeen voiced against a reform process that may translate\r\nsimply into a cost-cutting exercise, which ultimately may\r\nmean less focus on underdevelopment, poverty and social\r\ndislocations. These are valid concerns which I am sure the\r\nSecretary-General is conscious of and must address. But for\r\nthe sake of the larger purpose at stake, let us refrain from\r\nminuscule nit-picking. We need, rather, to adopt a\r\npragmatic and positive approach to the package. In this\r\nway, we can spare ourselves from long and protracted, if\r\nnot interminable, discussions which, as we know from\r\nexperience, too often end in committee gridlock, a type of\r\nparalysis by analysis.\r\nBowing to the realities of the Organization’s dire\r\nfinancial predicament, the Secretary-General has\r\naccordingly fashioned a credible reorganization that will\r\nenhance efficiency and responsiveness and effectively\r\ncontribute to a strengthened Untied Nations, capable of\r\nfulfilling its mission.\r\nThere appears to be a near universal consensus on the\r\nneed to reform the United Nations. Regrettably though,\r\nmuch of the impetus is dictated by the Organization’s acute\r\nfinancial situation. Were all Member States to honour their\r\ntreaty commitments to pay their assessment obligations in\r\nfull, on time and without condition, reform would focus\r\nmore on what the United Nations can and must do than on\r\nwhat it cannot and is unable to do. An effective United\r\nNations cannot operate on subsistence, hand-to-mouth and\r\never dwindling resources that perpetually keep it on the\r\nbrink of bankruptcy.\r\nUltimately, the financial solvency of the United\r\nNations is the responsibility of Member States. Sound\r\nfinances are the sine qua non of the effectiveness and\r\nstability of the Organization. Without a continuous and\r\npredictable flow of resources, the danger posed to the\r\nindependence, if not survival, of the United Nations is very\r\nreal.\r\nThe issue of Security Council reform need not be\r\nlinked to the reform proposal presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The latter must run its own course and, acted upon\r\nindependently, culminate in a resolution for its adoption.\r\nIn step with the growth in membership of the\r\nOrganization, the Council must be enlarged to reflect the\r\npressing need for equitable representation. In view of the\r\nconsiderable debate this issue has generated over the\r\nyears, we believe that the time has come for a change in\r\nthe Security Council, particularly with the admission of\r\nnew permanent members from all the regions of the world\r\nand from the industrialized countries, wielding the same\r\npowers as the existing ones. As we all know, a cardinal\r\ntenet of the thesis of good governance is that all members\r\nof a body politic have a fair and equal role in decisions\r\nwhich affect them. Djibouti fully endorses the position of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Non-\r\nAligned Movement regarding the expansion, composition\r\nand working methods of the Council.\r\nExcept as a metaphor for international peacekeeping\r\nfailure, Somalia has exited the international radar screen\r\nof concern. This is regrettable, for there have been\r\npersistent regional and international efforts to initiate\r\ndialogue among the parties. True, much of Somalia\r\ncontinues to exist in a cycle of misery and political\r\nimpasse, lacking a central authority, internal security and\r\nnational cohesion. The spread of conventional weapons\r\nhas engendered insecurity and political uncertainty — a\r\nlooming threat even to the warlords and to the long-range\r\nprospects for peace in the country and the region.\r\nPerhaps, as is often the case, there may be foreign\r\nelements that are developing profitable interests under the\r\npresent state of anarchy.\r\nThere is, however, a growing and encouraging\r\nemergence of a movement to reconstitute some form of\r\nnational structure and to set aside differences. We cannot\r\nignore this glimmer of hope, however elusive. With one\r\nor two notable exceptions, the factions seem to have\r\nresolved to hold a conference this November in Somalia,\r\nin the town of Bossaso. The aim is to establish an interim\r\nauthority whose main task will be to prepare the\r\ngroundwork for drafting a constitution, holding elections\r\nand the emergence, hopefully, of a national Government.\r\nThis subregional effort, spearheaded by Ethiopia, not only\r\nenjoys the wide support of many Governments and\r\norganizations, but is perhaps the most promising initiative\r\nat the moment.\r\nThe interminable stalling of progress towards\r\nreconciliation, the stifling stalemate, must come to an end.\r\nThe time has come to say to our Somali sisters and\r\nbrothers, “Enough is enough!” Enough misery, mayhem,\r\nbloodshed and destruction. Enough of the senseless\r\nindifference to and reckless disregard for life, property\r\nand nationhood. Enough of the grim prospects of an\r\nuncertain future for a whole generation of Somalis.\r\nEnough of assigning Somalia to the footnotes of history.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nIn the final analysis, the creativity, vision and determination\r\nof the Somali people shall prevail. For all its anarchy and\r\ndestruction, Somalia can benefit from the example of\r\nLiberia, which, like Somalia, was a country written off, a\r\ncountry in name only, just a few months ago. There as\r\nwell, conflict between warlords and factions succeeded only\r\nin bringing the country to its knees. Now, through\r\nconcerted dialogue and determination, and constant\r\nprodding by the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) and the United Nations, elections have\r\nbeen held and stability and peace reestablished, and there\r\nis a legitimate Government which enjoys international\r\nrecognition. The same could be true for Somalia.\r\nThe countries of the region, the United Nations,\r\nnations with a historic relationship with Somalia and the\r\ninternational community at large must support, morally as\r\nwell as materially, the ongoing efforts to bring about\r\ndialogue, reconciliation, lasting peace and harmony in\r\nSomalia. As in Liberia, that may be the gist of the message\r\nSomalia is sending the international community at this\r\ncritical juncture. We must respond, and respond united,\r\nwith one voice.\r\nBy virtue of the close proximity and the many\r\ncommon factors that bind us together, Djibouti has a special\r\ninterest in the destiny and well-being of the Somali people.\r\nThat is why, as far back as 1991, at the advent of the\r\nconflict, we took the lead in bringing the contending parties\r\ntogether in two successive and substantive reconciliation\r\nconferences in Djibouti. Since then we have remained\r\nseized of the situation there. It is well known that Djibouti\r\nhas received a staggering flow of refugees from Somalia,\r\nwhich, in relation to our size and resources, has been\r\noverwhelming. This mammoth humanitarian undertaking on\r\nour part is indeed beyond our capacity to sustain\r\nindefinitely. We appeal to the international community to\r\ncontinue to be supportive of our sacrifices by contributing\r\nsubstantially towards the mitigation of this burden.\r\nThe Horn of Africa region is passing through a period\r\nof relative stability and rejuvenation. The aftermaths of\r\nprevious conflicts are still visible, of course, in the extent\r\nof physical, institutional and human destruction.\r\nReconstruction will require genuine regional cooperation.\r\nOur peoples, our land, our waters and coastlines and our\r\neconomies are too interdependent to survive in isolation.\r\nThat is the spirit which must prevail.\r\nWe have an important regional institution in the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\r\nwhich serves as a regional focus for development\r\ncooperation and conflict resolution. Its capability and\r\nresources deserve the continued support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nDjibouti continues its economic transformation,\r\ninstitutional reform and demobilization process. For each\r\nof these we continue to require generous international\r\nassistance, and towards this end wish to express our\r\nappreciation for the commitments pledged during the\r\nround-table conference held in May this year under the\r\numbrella of the United Nations Development Programme\r\nand the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nThe legacy of past instability, widespread conflict\r\nand State collapse in the Horn of Africa have had many\r\ndisruptive consequences for Djibouti. No doubt we\r\nsuffered in tandem with our neighbours. But we are\r\nconfident our efforts to deal with these difficulties will be\r\nsupported by the international community.\r\nThe Mid-Term Review of the Implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s and the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development Least Developed Countries 1997\r\nreport indicate that the ominous slide suffered by many\r\nleast developed countries during the 1980s was reversed\r\nin 1995, and improvements continued into 1996. Despite\r\ndeclines in commodity prices and terms of trade, a\r\nnumber of least developed countries have enjoyed positive\r\ngrowth rates, indicating the beneficial effects of ongoing\r\nstructural adjustment efforts. These encouraging signs\r\ncomplemented efforts towards democratization, good\r\ngovernance and regional economic cooperation.\r\nNowadays it is commonly accepted that as more\r\npeoples and countries participate in the global economy,\r\nproduction and wealth increase for everyone. It is equally\r\ntrue, however, that in this era of rapid globalization many\r\ndeveloping countries with small markets, poor\r\ninfrastructures, unskilled manpower and high levels of\r\nexternal debt are excluded from the benefits of\r\nglobalization and are unable to cope with the challenges.\r\nMost of the least developed countries — and 33 of the\r\nworld’s 48 are in Africa — face the risk of further\r\nmarginalization despite determined efforts towards\r\nreforms which must merit greater international support.\r\nCoupled with this is the falling of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, which Norway’s Minister for\r\nDevelopment Cooperation described as unacceptable,\r\nsince the poorest countries need to finance basic social\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nservices and infrastructure as well as capacity-building and\r\ncompetence.\r\nThe least developed countries, particularly those in\r\nAfrica, tread a fine line between sustainable progress and\r\ndecline. They are expected to carry out extensive reforms\r\nwhile concurrently addressing the social needs brought\r\nabout by widespread poverty, environmental degradation\r\nand urban explosions. Africa also continues to attract\r\nnegligible foreign direct investment flows, which are largely\r\nconcentrated in a few countries.\r\nThe internal conflicts raging in a number of African\r\ncountries seriously further undermine an already fragile\r\nregional stability. African leaders and organizations such as\r\nthe Organization of African Unity, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States, IGAD and the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), together with\r\nthe international community, are engaged in active and\r\nrelentless efforts to bring about cessation of hostilities,\r\nreconciliations and the re-establishment of law and order.\r\nOn the positive side, we congratulate Liberia for\r\nhaving finally overcome the prolonged and sustained\r\nbloodshed and self-destruction. We deplore however,\r\ngrowing signs of a resurgence of hostilities in Angola, and\r\nwe condemn the overthrow of Sierra Leone’s constitutional\r\nand legitimate Government. We hope the efforts of the\r\ncountries of the region through ECOWAS will be crowned\r\nwith success.\r\nLikewise, we applaud the tenacity of President Omar\r\nBongo of Gabon and Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun, the\r\nUnited Nations/Organization of African Unity Special\r\nRepresentative, in the effort to secure a durable ceasefire in\r\nBrazzaville and to find a political solution in the face of\r\nopen and undisguised challenges to the authority of the\r\nelected President.\r\nSimilar challenges have either succeeded or stalemated\r\nin Burundi, the Central African Republic and, now,\r\nComoros. We hope reason will eventually prevail in all\r\nthese situations so that the people are spared further strife\r\nand uncertainty.\r\nIn this context, I welcome the timely initiative by\r\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright, to convene a special\r\nministerial meeting of the United Nations Security Council\r\non Africa, which took place on 25 September 1997. We\r\nbelieve such bold initiatives will help mitigate the ominous\r\ntendencies of increasing insularity and inward focus of\r\nmany developed countries, where events in far-off places\r\nno longer seem so relevant to core interests within them.\r\nWe welcome Secretary of State Albright’s injection\r\nof new momentum into the peace process between Israel\r\nand the Palestinians. Unilateral decisions by Israel must\r\nstop, and Israel must also refrain from actions which\r\ncontinuously disrupt and divert the direction of the talks.\r\nContrary to what Israel wants us to believe, the peace\r\nprocess has not been faltering on account of the suicide\r\nbombings alone — which, unfortunately, took many\r\nlives — but because of Israel’s refusal to implement\r\nterms of the Interim Agreement.\r\nNo one, of course, condones the bombings, with\r\ntheir gruesome human toll. They are acts which must be\r\ncondemned and only underscore the urgency of resuming\r\nthe peace process with a genuine determination. The\r\npunishment meted out on Palestinian territories has only\r\nfurther aggravated an explosive situation. Predictably, the\r\neconomic effects have been devastating. Ironically, Oslo\r\nhad convinced a majority of Palestinians that it might be\r\npossible to coexist with Israel in peace under an\r\nindependent Palestinian State controlling its own destiny.\r\nYet now they are little more than security hostages under\r\nrelentless coercion and pressures.\r\nThe basic situation in Palestine has not changed.\r\nIsrael needs security and peace; Palestinians need land, as\r\nwell as peace and security. Neither can unilaterally dictate\r\nterms to the other side. Escalating punishment will not\r\nbring security. Israel needs to demonstrate its seriousness\r\nand its willingness to move towards secure peace in the\r\nMiddle East and towards credible negotiations and lasting\r\nsettlement on the basis of resolutions 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973), and 425 (1978), exchanging land for peace.\r\nFor the overwhelming majority of humanity the\r\ndisillusioning regression in the peace process has caused\r\ndeep anguish. It would be a pity if the yearning for peace,\r\nsecurity, justice and resolution continues to be eschewed\r\nand misdirected. We are quite hopeful Secretary Albright\r\nwill persevere to keep the process on track.\r\nOnce again we implore Iran and the United Arab\r\nEmirates to commence serious negotiations to peacefully\r\nresolve the dispute regarding the three islands occupied\r\nby Iran.\r\nThe recently concluded Oslo Diplomatic Conference\r\nseeking a worldwide ban on the production, distribution,\r\nstockpiling and use of landmines was clearly a watershed\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nevent. We welcome this landmark achievement, which now\r\nprovides us with a vehicle to stop the slaughter of so many\r\nthousands of human beings each year by the 110 million\r\ndevices already in place all over the world.\r\nTo prevent our global village from becoming an armed\r\ncamp, the landmine Convention, to be signed in Ottawa this\r\nDecember, is perhaps as critical as the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention. Landmines are surely as dangerous\r\nas terrorism, drug trafficking and international mobs.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call His Excellency Mr. Shukheriin Altangerel,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Altangerel (Mongolia) (spoke in Mongolian;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It gives me\r\npleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Udovenko,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, on his unanimous\r\nelection to the presidency of the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and to wish him success in the discharge\r\nof his important responsibilities and duties. May I also\r\nthank Mr. Razali, Permanent Representative of Malaysia,\r\nthe outgoing President, for his able stewardship and for the\r\ninitiatives he undertook during the past session.\r\nThe disintegration of the bipolar world structure and\r\nthe end of the cold war are creating favourable conditions\r\nfor realizing the goals and principles enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Globalization — vigorous\r\neconomic integration and interdependence — is becoming\r\na prevailing tendency throughout the world. The\r\nfundamental changes that international relations are\r\nundergoing, as well as the new challenges and global\r\nagendas, demand from the United Nations, its specialized\r\nagencies and the Member States new visions and collective\r\nefforts and actions commensurate to these realities. I wish\r\nto underline that the overwhelming majority of the\r\ninternational community recognizes these changes, is\r\nadjusting accordingly and is contributing to this process. It\r\nis hardly possible to visualize our common future if we do\r\nnot jointly solve the socio-economic problems and the\r\nquestions posed by underdevelopment, unemployment,\r\nhunger, poverty, disease, crime natural disasters.\r\nMongolia stands for making the United Nations an\r\neffective and efficient organization able to meet the\r\nchallenges of the new millennium — a political, economic\r\nand legal instrument capable of safeguarding the interests\r\nof all nations, especially the small ones, on the basis of\r\nequality and justice.\r\nUnited Nations reform has been a subject of\r\nsubstantive debate in recent years. It is therefore natural\r\nthat the reform agenda, in particular the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on a programme for reform, is at the\r\ncentre of attention at this session. Mongolia duly\r\ncommends the constructive efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to reform the United Nations and overcome its\r\npresent financial crisis. It thus welcomes the reform\r\nprogramme he submitted to the General Assembly. We\r\nbelieve that thorough consideration should be given to the\r\nspecific proposals, such as a reasonable reduction of the\r\nstaff of the Secretariat, allocation of the resulting savings\r\nto acceleration of development, establishment of the post\r\nof Deputy Secretary-General and creation of a United\r\nNations Development Group so as to improve\r\ncoordination and management. It is clear that United\r\nNations reform is not an event, but rather a process. We\r\nshare the view that it is a continuous process, the end\r\nresult of which should be measured by the increase in the\r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations.\r\nMongolia supports the view that the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council’s permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership should provide equal regional representation\r\nand that the Council’s activities should be democratized\r\nand made more transparent. Despite the enlargement of\r\nthe Council membership, the overwhelming majority of\r\nMember States will still not be directly represented.\r\nTherefore, Mongolia’s proposal to institutionalize the\r\nfuller participation of Member States in the Council\r\nproceedings, including its formal meetings, is finding\r\nincreasing support within the Organization.\r\nMongolia appreciates and supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to give priority to socio-economic\r\nquestions, to invigorate United Nations development\r\nactivities and enhance international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. To this end it is vital that the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies and international\r\ntrade and financial institutions intensify their activities in\r\nthis area and better coordinate their interactions.\r\nToday it is universally accepted that sustainable\r\ndevelopment could be attained if it were approached in a\r\ncomprehensive manner, and that sustained economic\r\ngrowth is closely linked with social development and\r\nenvironmental protection. It is gratifying to note that the\r\nAgenda for Development, adopted this year, has been\r\ndrawn up precisely in this spirit. We consider it an\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nimportant document that defines the strategy of international\r\ncooperation for development, and we believe that\r\nimplementation of its provisions is vitally important.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly held last\r\nJune reviewed and assessed the implementation of the Rio\r\nsummit decisions and outlined future actions. Since Agenda\r\n21, adopted five years ago in Rio de Janeiro, has not been\r\nfully realized, the international community should accord\r\ngreater attention to its complete implementation.\r\nMongolia believes that implementing the important\r\ndecisions and recommendations of the summit conferences\r\nheld under United Nations auspices in the early 1990s is\r\ncrucial for consolidating the positive trends in world social\r\ndevelopment and redoubling international cooperation for\r\npoverty alleviation, human rights protection, food security,\r\nthe environment, advancement of women, protection of the\r\nrights of the child and sustainable human settlement.\r\nWhile fostering international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, it is important to accord high priority to\r\naddressing the problems of the most disadvantaged\r\ndeveloping countries that have unfavourable locations,\r\nsevere climate and underdeveloped infrastructure.\r\nLandlocked developing countries, handicapped by their\r\ngeographical location and remoteness from world markets,\r\nface tremendous obstacles and hardships in their efforts for\r\ndevelopment and advancement. Reality shows that these\r\ncountries risk becoming marginalized from the ongoing\r\nglobalization process in the world economy and\r\ninternational trade. Therefore, it is imperative for the\r\ninternational community to increase its support of and\r\ncooperation with these countries, as envisaged in the\r\nAgenda for Development.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that landlocked developing\r\ncountries are taking concrete steps to develop transit\r\ntransport cooperation with their transit neighbours. My\r\nGovernment believes that the first-ever North-east Asia\r\nSubregional Consultative Meeting on Transit\r\nTransportation, held in Ulan Bator this year, has laid the\r\ngroundwork for the development of such regional\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe notion of and criteria for defining international\r\npeace and security are undergoing changes. With the\r\nimprovement of the international political climate, the\r\ndangers posed by nuclear war and the arms race are\r\nreceding, while prospects for taking concrete steps on\r\npractical disarmament are improving. The very concept of\r\nsecurity based primarily on the size of armed forces and\r\nmilitary alliances or associations has also been changing.\r\nIt now includes the level of development and progress,\r\nwealth and the well-being of peoples, as well as the\r\nextent to which human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nare insured. All this must find due reflection in United\r\nNations activities.\r\nI am pleased to inform the General Assembly that\r\nlast July Mongolia ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty. Given the paramount significance of the\r\nTreaty, Mongolia believes that there is an urgent need to\r\nhave it enter into force as soon as possible, to implement\r\nits provisions strictly and to make operational its\r\ninternational verification system.\r\nThe international community must take specific\r\nmeasures designed to act on the advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on the obligation to pursue\r\nand bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear\r\ndisarmament under strict and effective international\r\ncontrol.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia is pleased with the\r\nentry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. Its\r\nratification by the United States of America and a pledge\r\nby the Russian Federation — these being the two major\r\nPowers possessing substantial arsenals of these weapons\r\nof mass destruction — to ratify that Convention are\r\nimportant prerequisites for subsequent successful\r\nenforcement.\r\nIn the past few years the trend to establish nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones has been gaining momentum.\r\nMongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size of\r\nits armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowest\r\npossible level and of ensuring its independence and\r\nnational security primarily by political and diplomatic\r\nmeans. In 1992 Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone, and it is now seeking to institutionalize\r\nthis status internationally. Within this framework, we\r\npresented to the last session of the United Nations\r\nDisarmament Commission a working paper on the basic\r\nprinciples and elements of the concept of the single-State\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. I take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our firm support for the proposal to establish\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions, particularly\r\nin Central Asia, and our readiness to work actively for\r\nrealizing this.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nIt is regrettable that sources of tension and conflict\r\npersist in some regions of the world. International peace\r\nand security would be strengthened if the parties concerned\r\nwere to display political will and utmost restraint in\r\nresolving their differences by negotiation and other peaceful\r\nmeans.\r\nBearing in mind the importance of strengthening the\r\nrule of law in international relations, the international\r\ncommunity declared the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law and has taken a series of related\r\nmeasures. It is gratifying to note that on the initiative of\r\nMongolia, the current session is to consider the question of\r\ndrafting guiding principles for international negotiations.\r\nMongolia believes that the adoption of a document defining\r\nguiding principles for international negotiations would not\r\nonly meet the purposes and principles of the Decade but\r\nwould also promote the definition of international criteria\r\nfor conducting international negotiations on the basis of\r\njustice and the sovereign equality of States, irrespective of\r\ntheir actual power.\r\nMongolia continues to support the convening in 1998\r\nof a diplomatic conference on the establishment of the\r\ninternational criminal court. We believe that the jurisdiction\r\nof the court should cover, inter alia, crimes of aggression\r\nand grave environmental crimes.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia is consistently pursuing\r\na policy of democratization, embracing a market economy\r\nand opening up to the world. In the last year the new\r\nGovernment has undertaken a series of very important\r\nmeasures to accelerate political and economic reforms,\r\nstabilize the country’s economy and ensure economic\r\ngrowth. To cite an example, we have introduced a zero\r\nper cent import tariff and accelerated the pace of\r\nprivatization. These are important steps to attract foreign\r\ndirect investment and expand trade with our major partners\r\nand the world at large.\r\nFull membership in the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) early this year greatly contributed to the forward-\r\nlooking development of Mongolia. We seek to cooperate\r\nconstructively with WTO as the main multilateral trade-\r\nrule-setting mechanism.\r\nAs part of our policy of actively joining global and\r\nregional economic integration, Mongolia is striving to\r\npursue a policy aimed at strengthening peace and security\r\nand developing cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. We are\r\nfocusing our attention on North-East Asia in particular and\r\nare committed to increasing our cooperation with the\r\ncountries of the region, both on a bilateral and a\r\nmultilateral basis.\r\nI should like to express our hope that Mongolia’s\r\ninteraction with the United Nations, its agencies and other\r\ninternational organizations and our bilateral cooperation\r\nwith Member States will continue to play a valuable part\r\nin overcoming underdevelopment, in dealing with the\r\nhardships inherent in our transitional period and in\r\nmeeting pressing socio-economic challenges. In this\r\nconnection, I wish to express the gratitude of my\r\nGovernment to the donor countries, the United Nations\r\nand other international institutions for the support and\r\nassistance they have given my country.\r\nMongolia has always viewed the United Nations as\r\nan important instrument for safeguarding international\r\npeace and security and for promoting social and economic\r\ndevelopment, and has always supported it. We remain\r\ncommitted to strengthening the United Nations and\r\nenhancing its efficiency and effectiveness collectively\r\nwith all Member States.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call on the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nGambia, His Excellency Mr. Omar Yusupha Njie.\r\nMr. Njie (Gambia): Allow me first of all to extend\r\nmy delegation’s whole-hearted congratulations on the\r\nunanimous election of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko to the\r\nhigh office of President of this session. His skills as a\r\nstatesman are excellent qualifications for the presidency,\r\nand I wish to assure him of my delegation’s support and\r\ncooperation at all times during the proceedings of this\r\nsession.\r\nMy delegation’s appreciation also goes to the\r\nPresident of the fifty-first session, His Excellency\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for the impressive work he\r\naccomplished during his presidency. His efforts to\r\nimprove the work of the General Assembly and\r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations in international\r\naffairs have increased the momentum of the United\r\nNations reform process. My delegation congratulates him\r\non a job well done.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I also wish to extend\r\nour congratulations to the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan. Since he assumed office in\r\nJanuary this year, he has been engaged in commendable\r\nefforts to reform the United Nations Organization. The\r\npresentation of his two-tracked proposals and measures\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nconstitutes a bold and far-reaching reform programme,\r\nwhich is expected not only to revitalize the United Nations\r\nsystem but also to make it better suited to execute its\r\nmandates in the years ahead in a more efficient and cost-\r\neffective manner.\r\nThe fifty-second session of the General Assembly is\r\ntaking place at an important period during the international\r\ncommunity’s effort to evolve an atmosphere of viable and\r\nequitable international cooperation in the areas of economic\r\ndevelopment, social advancement and the recognition of the\r\nimportant need for the maintenance of a balanced global\r\necosystem.\r\nThe recent holding of the nineteenth special session of\r\nthe General Assembly, on the overall review and appraisal\r\nof the implementation of Agenda 21, is one of the many\r\nfactors and activities that symbolize the importance of this\r\nperiod and that mark our collective effort to shape a more\r\nmeaningful atmosphere of international cooperation. The\r\nspecial session reaffirmed the international community’s\r\neffort to ensure that the blueprint for international\r\ndevelopment and the preservation of the environment, as\r\nenunciated in Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration five years\r\nago, are translated into concrete realities.\r\nThe successes and constraints so far recorded in our\r\neffort to achieve sustainable development clearly point to\r\nthe difficulty of creating a framework for international\r\ncooperation characterized by the full and continued\r\ncommitment of both developed and developing countries.\r\nAs stated by Her Excellency the Vice-President of the\r\nGambia during the special session,\r\n“The difficult and protracted negotiations and the\r\nintellectual, expert and statesmanlike efforts that made\r\nthese agreements possible reflected the goodwill and\r\ngood faith of all Governments ...\r\n“... the constraints cited as obstacles to implementation\r\nduring this review session tend to indicate the\r\npersistence of the contentious and also cross-cutting\r\nissues of additional financial resources, technology\r\ntransfer, information sharing, training and institutional\r\ncapacity-building and the unfulfillment of our\r\ndifferentiated responsibilities under these provisions”.\r\n[See Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nNineteenth Special Session, Plenary Meetings, 9th\r\nmeeting]\r\nI wish to inform the General Assembly of the political\r\nevolution taking shape in my country, the Gambia. Since\r\nthe Gambian delegation addressed the Assembly last year,\r\nwe have successfully completed a two-year transition\r\nprogramme to democratic civilian rule with the entry into\r\nforce of a new Constitution for the Second Republic in\r\nJanuary this year. Successful free and fair presidential and\r\nNational Assembly elections were held earlier, in\r\nSeptember 1996 and early January 1997. Most of the\r\ninstitutions provided for under the new Constitution are\r\nalready in place and have started to play their legitimate\r\nrole in the promotion and entrenchment of a genuine\r\ndemocratic culture that is commensurate with the hopes\r\nand aspirations of all Gambians. Throughout the transition\r\nprocess, the people of the Gambia have been regularly\r\nconsulted; their views and aspirations have guided the\r\nprocess. In this exercise we have been faithful to our\r\nwishes. The Gambian National Assembly, which is\r\nplaying its important role in our nation-building, has been\r\nreadmitted to the Commonwealth Parliamentary\r\nAssociation, where we will continue to participate\r\nactively.\r\nAlive to the fact that genuine democracy can neither\r\nthrive nor be nurtured and sustained in the midst of\r\npoverty, deprivation, hunger, ignorance and ill-health, the\r\nGambia Government embarked on an ambitious socio-\r\neconomic development programme during the two-year\r\ntransition period, which focused basically on building\r\nschools, health facilities, roads and other infrastructure as\r\nwell as on boosting agricultural development in order to\r\nensure food self-sufficiency by the year 1999. The main\r\nobjective of this programme was to lay the basis for a\r\ngenuine and sustainable democracy that is in consonance\r\nwith our own social and other specificities as a nation.\r\nThe successful completion of the transition period\r\nintensified our Government’s determination to continue\r\nthe effective implementation of measures and programmes\r\ndesigned to promote and achieve the sustained socio-\r\neconomic development of the Gambia. In order to\r\naccomplish this task, the Government of the Gambia, in\r\ncollaboration with the private sector, has embarked on the\r\nimplementation of a national development programme to\r\ntransform the country economically and socially over a\r\n25-year period into a developed, economically viable\r\nState. The blueprint for this socio-economic development\r\nis called Vision 2020. The overall orientation of this\r\ndevelopment blueprint, as enunciated in its mission\r\nstatement, is:\r\n“To transform the Gambia into a financial\r\ncentre, a tourist paradise, a trading export-oriented\r\nagricultural and manufacturing nation, thriving on\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nfree market policies and a vibrant private sector,\r\nsustained by a well-educated, trained, skilled, healthy,\r\nself-reliant and enterprising population, and\r\nguaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent\r\nstandard of living for one and all, under a system of\r\ngovernment based on the consent of the citizenry”.\r\nIt is obvious from that mission statement that we in\r\nthe Gambia have opted for a holistic development strategy\r\nthat is human-centred and export-oriented, and founded on\r\nfree market principles. As rightly pointed out by His\r\nExcellency President Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh in his\r\nforeword to Vision 2020,\r\n“This means that the production base of the\r\neconomy will be strengthened and diversified to cater\r\nfor the needs of an export-oriented industry. In pursuit\r\nof pragmatism, Vision 2020 will build on the sound\r\nmacroeconomic policies of our recent past while\r\nlaunching a new partnership contract between the\r\npublic and private sectors to spin faster growth with\r\nequity.”\r\nIn this connection, the Gambia has embarked on a\r\nsustained effort to enhance bilateral and multilateral\r\ncooperation with all friendly countries and institutions in\r\norder to ensure the realization of our development goals as\r\nenshrined in Vision 2020. In pursuit of these goals, we will\r\nnot relent in our efforts to develop and enhance intra-\r\nAfrican cooperation and solidarity in all vital sectors for the\r\nattainment of sustained economic growth. It is in fact the\r\nGambia’s firm belief and conviction that it is only through\r\nsuch cooperation, founded on self-reliance and hard work,\r\nthat African countries can adequately rise to the daunting\r\ndevelopment challenges facing them.\r\nTo complement our own efforts at the national,\r\nsubregional and regional levels, no effort will be spared to\r\ndevelop and enhance cooperation with all traditional\r\ndevelopment partners as well as new friends in conformity\r\nwith the underlying principles of the Gambia’s foreign\r\npolicy objectives, which are predicated on openness,\r\npeaceful coexistence, genuine respect for each other’s point\r\nof view and full equality in international intercourse with\r\nall countries. We strongly believe that it is only through\r\ndialogue and the constant quest to understand the points of\r\nview of others that we can aspire to attain world peace,\r\nmutual trust and understanding.\r\nHere, I would like to underline again that the\r\ncentrepiece of the Gambia’s foreign policy is the promotion\r\nof African solidarity and self-reliance and the enhancement\r\nof world peace. That is why we are friends of all\r\ncountries of the world irrespective of ideological or\r\npolitical differences. This policy is predicated on our\r\nstrong belief that the world is one family, and that it pays\r\nno dividends to isolate any member of that great family,\r\nbecause any member of the family which feels isolated\r\nquickly becomes intransigent and hostile in its dealings\r\nwith the rest of us. It is therefore paramount for us to\r\nmaintain lines of dialogue between ourselves, which can\r\nonly promote understanding.\r\nOn global economic issues, we note that the world\r\neconomic outlook continues to be influenced strongly by\r\nthe forces of economic globalization and trade\r\nliberalization, which in themselves are not negative\r\ntrends, provided they are underpinned by a genuine desire\r\non the part of all concerned to promote partnership, in an\r\nenvironment where equality reigns supreme.\r\nThe persistent slow rate of development in Africa\r\ncan be traced to certain factors and impediments. Africa’s\r\nforeign debt crisis remains a major impediment to growth.\r\nThe international community’s effort to resolve Africa’s\r\nexternal debt problem continues to fall short of the\r\ndesired result. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\nInitiative, recently adopted by the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF) and the World Bank, while complementing\r\nthe global effort, also fell short of the expected target of\r\ncomplete cancellation of the debt stock of developing\r\ncountries. Unless this is done, the debt burden will\r\nnaturally continue to have a negative impact on the\r\navailability of existing resources to finance Africa’s\r\neconomic recovery and social development.\r\nAlso, the growth and expansion of the incidence of\r\npoverty in Africa has contributed to the failure to achieve\r\nsustainable development on the continent. The sombre\r\nconclusions on the increase of poverty reflect, in a wider\r\nsense, the seeming lack of the required commitment by\r\nthe international community to promote social progress\r\nand the qualitative improvement of the human condition,\r\nas recommended by the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nHere I want to state that my country, the Gambia,\r\nhas embarked on a bold national plan of action for the\r\neradication of poverty, and I want to commend the United\r\nNations system, the World Bank and other bilateral\r\npartners that are actively assisting us to achieve our goals\r\nin this domain. We thank them for their continued\r\nsupport. Poverty, we all agree, is a global problem that\r\nneeds to be addressed by all of us.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nThe pursuit of global peace and security remains a\r\nfundamental responsibility of our Organization. It is,\r\nhowever, regrettable that the international community’s\r\neffort to achieve international peace and security has been\r\nconstrained by continued conflicts and other forms of\r\ntension between States and communities.\r\nIn our own subregion of West Africa, the situation\r\nevolving in Sierra Leone remains of grave concern, not\r\nonly to us but also to the international community. Failure\r\nto resolve the problem and restore stability, security and\r\nconstitutionality in Sierra Leone can only prolong the ordeal\r\nof the innocent and peace-loving people of that country.\r\nTherefore, we all hope that the initiatives embarked upon\r\nby the Economic Community of West African State\r\n(ECOWAS) within the framework of the Committee of\r\nFive will yield the anticipated results. I am pleased to note\r\nthat the approach adopted by the Committee of Five to find\r\na solution to the Sierra Leone crisis has the support of the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU).\r\nIt is hoped that the restoration of constitutional\r\ndemocracy in Liberia following the national elections held\r\non 19 July 1997 will lead to a permanent peaceful solution\r\nto the country’s crisis, paving the way for sustained\r\nnational reconstruction. All of us in the subregion are\r\ngiving our material and moral support to the sister Republic\r\nof Liberia to help it stay on the path of national\r\nreconciliation in order to recover fully from its tragedies of\r\nthe recent past.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East, despite the significant\r\nprogress of the past few years in the Middle East peace\r\nprocess, especially since the signing of the Oslo accords,\r\nwe note with concern the erosion of the peace dividend\r\naccumulated in the international community’s effort to\r\nachieve durable peace there. The recent escalation of\r\ntension between Israel and Palestine over the extension of\r\nIsraeli settlements in East Jerusalem constitutes a serious\r\nthreat to peace and security in the region.\r\nThe adoption by the General Assembly of resolution\r\nES-10/3 of 15 July 1997, as well as other peace initiatives\r\nby the international community should, however, provide\r\nthe basis for a peaceful and permanent solution to the\r\nconflict.\r\nOn a more general note, we in the Gambia strongly\r\nbelieve that the containment of tension and conflict globally\r\ncan be enhanced by transparency, the restoration of mutual\r\ntrust and confidence and respect for the rights of peoples,\r\ncommunities and nations in the execution of the role and\r\nmandates of the United Nations. As I indicated earlier, it\r\nis only through genuine dialogue and the desire and will\r\nto understand each other that we can achieve global\r\npeace.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation strongly supports the\r\naspiration of the 21.3 million people of the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan to exercise their right to share and\r\nparticipate in the activities of intergovernmental\r\norganizations on international cooperation by joining this\r\ncomity of nations. The legitimacy of their aspirations,\r\nboth legal and national, has been reinforced by similar\r\nactions and measures taken by the United Nations on the\r\nissue of parallel representation, which now serve as useful\r\nreminders and examples. The Taiwan question is also a\r\ntest of the international community’s interpretation of\r\ndemocracy. As we are all aware, the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan has existed, physically, legally and politically,\r\nsince the foundation of the United Nations. My\r\nGovernment therefore believes that our Organization will\r\ndo itself a great service by admitting Taiwan into our\r\nmidst, in the true spirit of the application of democratic\r\nprinciples. The presence of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan among us can only enrich our Organization. In\r\nthis regard, we therefore believe that resolution 2758\r\n(XXVI) adopted at the twenty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly, needs to be reviewed.\r\nConcerning the legal dispute surrounding the\r\nbombing of Pan Am flight 103, the Gambia supports the\r\nresolution on the matter adopted by the OAU Heads of\r\nState or Government in Harare last May as providing a\r\nviable framework for resolving the present impasse.\r\nWith regard to Cuba, it is incomprehensible to us\r\nGambians why a whole people, a whole nation, should be\r\nmade to suffer the denial of the basic necessities of life\r\nsimply because it chooses to live under a different\r\npolitical ideology. Therefore, in the present climate of\r\ngreater international cooperation and reconciliation, the\r\npeople of Cuba and their Government deserve the support\r\nand assistance of the international community in their\r\ncontinued efforts to engage in more meaningful national\r\ndevelopment in order to achieve greater socio-economic\r\nprogress. We fully support the measures being taken by\r\nthis body to provide this support. In doing so, our\r\nOrganization will only be upholding the principle of\r\nrespecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people.\r\nIt is in this same spirit that we call on the\r\ninternational community to continue to preserve the\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\ndignity and security of the people and the Government of\r\nKuwait and to support the full implementation of the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions on payment of\r\nreparations and compensation, release of prisoners of war\r\nand other conditions imposed on Iraq for its internationally\r\ncondemned act of aggression against Kuwait. Therefore,\r\nwhile we encourage greater United Nations intervention in\r\nbringing solace to the suffering, innocent Iraqi civilian\r\npopulation, we strongly urge the Government of Iraq to\r\ncomply with the provisions of these Security Council\r\nresolutions, in order to alleviate the suffering, especially\r\nthat of the children.\r\nThat catalogue of conflicts and misunderstandings has\r\nprompted my Government and people to formulate the\r\nfollowing wish, which we want to express to the\r\ninternational community: we want the United Nations and\r\nthe international community to make a solemn pledge to\r\nensure that all conflicts are peacefully resolved by the year\r\n2000. In order to achieve this noble aim, we propose, first,\r\nthat 1998 be declared a year for the resolution of all\r\nconflicts between Member States; and, secondly, that 1999,\r\nas it is on the eve of the twenty-first century, be a year\r\ndevoid of conflicts and misunderstanding, to become the\r\nyear of reconciliation.\r\nThis, we believe, will enable humankind to enter the\r\ntwenty-first century as a united, peaceful family that can\r\nproudly bequeath to ensuing generations a developed,\r\npeaceful world, where democracy, justice, freedom and\r\nequality are guaranteed to everyone, irrespective of origin,\r\nrace, religion or political ideology. That is what the Gambia\r\nwants to bequeath to coming generations, and we strongly\r\nbelieve that all it takes is tolerance, mutual respect, love,\r\npatience and understanding.\r\nWith regard to global trade relations, we followed with\r\nhigh expectation the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations and its implementation.\r\nWhile encouraging globalization and liberalization, it\r\ndeprived developing countries, particularly those in Africa,\r\nof the opportunities and benefits predicted during its\r\nimplementation.\r\nWe note, however, that the liberalization of trade and\r\ninvestment policies has yet to foster international\r\ncooperation for the achievement of economic development\r\nand genuine partnership among all nations. Developing\r\ncountries in general, and African and the least developed\r\ncountries in particular, are yet to be effectively integrated\r\ninto the world economy. The commitments agreed in the\r\nFinal Act of the Uruguay Round have not been fully\r\nimplemented.\r\nInternational cooperation has, however, continued to\r\nflourish in other equally important areas. The promotion\r\nand expansion of South-South cooperation continues to\r\nreceive greater support among developing countries.\r\nThese cooperation initiatives have resulted in the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States, among many other\r\ninitiatives. Within the context of promoting South-South\r\ncooperation, Japan has successfully held the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD I) and it is now planning to host a follow-up\r\nconference, TICAD II, next year, in an effort to develop\r\na practical, achievable and sustainable development\r\nprogramme for Africa.\r\nIt is indeed commendable that this Japanese initiative\r\nis not restricted to Africa, but also includes the evolution\r\nof a new development strategy responsive to the present\r\ninternational development climate, and is providing the\r\nmotivating force for a concerted global effort. We\r\ncommend Japan for these initiatives, including financial\r\ncontributions which serve as a practical demonstration of\r\nSouth-South cooperative interaction and application.\r\nIt should, however, be pointed out that the\r\npromotion and application of South-South cooperation\r\nwithin the context of technical and economic cooperation\r\namong developing countries can only succeed as an\r\nimportant aspect of international development cooperation\r\nif both the South and North remain committed to its full\r\nrealization.\r\nIntra-African economic cooperation and integration\r\nhave also been growing. Regional activities are now\r\ndirected to the socio-economic transformation and\r\nintegration of the economies of African States. The\r\nadoption and implementation of the Abuja Treaty, putting\r\nin place economic integration arrangements, is a positive\r\neffort in building an African Economic Community. The\r\ninaugural session of the African Economic Community\r\nwas held during the thirty-third summit of Heads of State\r\nand Government of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) in June this year. We in Africa are becoming\r\nmore and more aware of the paramount importance of\r\nself-reliance. Any assistance from development partners\r\nmust be seen as a complement to what we can or should\r\ndo by ourselves.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nWithin the context of subregional cooperation, the\r\nGambia hosted the twelfth summit of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Permanent Inter-State Committee for\r\nDrought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), held in Banjul from\r\n11 to 12 September 1997. The summit unanimously elected\r\nHis Excellency Colonel Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, President\r\nof the Republic of the Gambia, as chairman of the\r\norganization for the next three years. These meetings and\r\nactivities testify to the importance attached to the issues of\r\ndrought and desertification, not only in Africa, but also in\r\nother parts of the world, and to the urgent need for a\r\nsustained collaborative effort to combat the twin menace. In\r\nthis regard, the Gambia is fully and actively participating in\r\nthe ongoing Rome Conference of the Parties to the United\r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those\r\nCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\r\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa. In fact, we should\r\nredouble the resources provided and the measures so far\r\nadopted to combat drought and desertification and improve\r\nour environment in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nConvention, and also of chapter 12 of Agenda 21, adopted\r\nat the United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment. In furtherance of these targets we intend to\r\nachieve, as President Yahya Jammeh stated, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and food security through research into the\r\nunderlying phenomena of drought, desertification and\r\necological instability and by designing and implementing\r\nprogrammes for natural resource management and the\r\nimprovement of agro-food sectors in the Sahel, as well as\r\nthe sustainability of farming systems.\r\nI will conclude with the subject of reform of the\r\nUnited Nations system, a subject very dear to the hearts of\r\nGambians. The reform of the United Nations system\r\ncontinues to engage our collective attention. Reform\r\nactivities — including the restructuring and revitalization of\r\nthe United Nations in the economic, social and related\r\nfields, especially the work of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil; and the efforts of the High-level Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations\r\nSystem in formulating innovative mechanisms to enhance\r\nthe role and functions of the General Assembly and its\r\nmain Committees, as well as of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council —\r\ncontinue to attract wide debate, both at the United Nations\r\nand in other forums. These include OAU, which at the\r\nsummit of Heads of State and Government held in Harare\r\nin June adopted a Declaration on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil to which the Gambia remains firmly committed.\r\nIt is my Government’s firm belief and conviction\r\nthat there is an urgent need to democratize the United\r\nNations, and especially the Security Council, to make it\r\nmore responsive to the hopes and aspirations of all its\r\nMembers for a world devoid of intolerance, injustice and\r\ninequality. There is therefore a need to curb the use of the\r\nveto, which is exercised by some Powers in the Security\r\nCouncil against the wishes of the vast majority of the\r\nMembers of our Organization. The geopolitical and\r\nhistorical considerations that were at the heart of the\r\npresent composition and mandate of the Security Council\r\nno longer prevail. The composition of the Security\r\nCouncil should therefore be reflective of the realities of\r\nour times, and the powers of the individual Member\r\nStates therein seen in the same light.\r\nWe also firmly believe that it is necessary to ensure\r\nthat United Nations resolutions and, indeed, decisions by\r\nthe International Court of Justice are respected, obeyed\r\nand implemented by all countries. It is not fair that while\r\nsome countries are chastised for violating United Nations\r\nresolutions, others seem to violate them with impunity.\r\nWith regard to the Secretary-General’s Track 2\r\nreform proposals, the report (A/51/950) entitled\r\n“Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for\r\nReform” includes bold and far-reaching measures and\r\nproposals. The Gambia generally supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform proposals, in particular the following.\r\nFirst, we have that of creating a dividend for\r\ndevelopment. The effectiveness of this initiative would\r\ndepend on Member States meeting their financial\r\ncontributions to the Organization on time. Moreover, the\r\ninitiative should serve as a catalyst for donors to provide\r\ngreater support for development by meeting the agreed\r\ntarget contribution of 0.7 per cent of their gross national\r\nproduct.\r\nSecondly, the creation of the post of Deputy\r\nSecretary-General is timely, given the increasing\r\nmandates of the Organization. However, it is expected\r\nthat the role of the Deputy Secretary-General would go\r\nbeyond mobilization of funds for the Organization to\r\nincorporate administrative coordination. The length of stay\r\nin office of the incumbent should be determined.\r\nThirdly, restructuring and regrouping of organs and\r\nagencies to facilitate their effectiveness and productivity\r\nshould be guided by agreed principles, procedures and\r\noperational objectives to prevent a reduction of their\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nusefulness while enhancing the achievements of their\r\nspecific goals.\r\nFourthly, the fiscal measures, including zero growth\r\nand personnel cuts, are necessary. It is expected that this\r\nwill not impair the Organization’s capability to fully\r\ndischarge all its responsibilities.\r\nFifthly, the putting into effect of “UN House” — the\r\ncommon premises system for all United Nations agencies\r\nserving in one country — is necessary and timely, given the\r\nsubstantial savings to be derived from the sharing of\r\ncommon services. Additionally, maintaining a common\r\nidentity and location in a country would enhance the United\r\nNations presence as a world Organization, as well as its\r\naccessibility in terms of speed and effective\r\ncommunication. It will also minimize confusion, waste\r\nand duplication of efforts.\r\nSuffice it to say that the Gambia will continue to\r\nstudy the Secretary-General’s reform proposals and their\r\nbroad implications for the Organization and Member\r\nStates in the years ahead.\r\nLastly, as we continue with the reform of the United\r\nNations system after over 50 years of operations, so must\r\nwe also continue to address the weaknesses, inequalities\r\nand inadequacies inherent in the international economic\r\nand social system, global trade, finance and investment,\r\ninternational development and so on in order to achieve\r\nmore meaningful international cooperation and global\r\npartnership, the promotion and preservation of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, the right to\r\ndevelopment, good governance and economic growth —\r\nall cherished hallmarks of sustainable development and\r\nhuman achievements.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
