(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker this afternoon is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Guinea-\r\nBissau, His Excellency Mr. Fernando Delfim da Silva, on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. da Silva (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\ninterpretation from French text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf\r\nof my country, Guinea-Bissau, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly and to reiterate our\r\nconfidence in your ability to conduct the work of this\r\nsession successfully. You can rest assured of the\r\nwillingness of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau to cooperate\r\nwith you.\r\nI should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia,\r\nfor the innovative and constructive manner in which he\r\ncarried out his task.\r\nCongratulations are also due the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, since his assumption of the\r\nOrganization’s highest office, has shouldered his important\r\nresponsibilities with great resolve, inter alia with regard to\r\nUnited Nations reform. We encourage him to continue his\r\nwork with the same dynamic spirit in order better to adapt\r\nour Organization to the current and future needs of a\r\nworld in flux.\r\nThe General Assembly is meeting at a time when the\r\nOrganization is going through a period of complex\r\ntransition that has brought several questions to the fore.\r\nGuinea-Bissau is nevertheless convinced of the ability of\r\nthe Organization and of Member States to define new\r\npolicies and to develop suitable structures to deal with the\r\nnew challenges that are being posed by international\r\nproblems.\r\nDuring the observance of the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe United Nations the leaders of the entire world\r\nsolemnly reaffirmed the irreplaceable nature of the\r\nOrganization’s role as well as the need to reform and\r\nmodernize the United Nations. The historic Declaration\r\nadopted at that time should continue to form the basis of\r\nthe Organization’s work, laying down as it does a\r\nframework for global action based on the principles and\r\nideals of the Charter.\r\nAccordingly, we welcome the important initiatives\r\nfor reform taken by the Secretary-General, which in my\r\ndelegation’s view are deserving of the support of Member\r\nStates.\r\nMy delegation believes that the expansion and\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council are also priority\r\nmatters. That important body must reflect, both in its\r\ncomposition and in its decisions, the concerns of all\r\nMembers and should have a more transparent basis and\r\na more equitable geographical representation.\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nTherefore, in keeping with the Harare Declaration of\r\nHeads of State and Government of the countries members\r\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), we believe\r\nthat Africa should have two permanent seats in the Security\r\nCouncil, with the same privileges as the current members.\r\nSimilarly, we believe that the candidacies of Japan,\r\nGermany and Brazil to be permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council deserve the serious attention of Guinea-\r\nBissau, without prejudice to other proposals before us for\r\nconsideration.\r\nThe United Nations has played a decisive role in\r\ninternational affairs since its founding. However, the\r\nchallenges we are facing at the threshold of the twenty-first\r\ncentury are unprecedented and call for greater efforts from\r\nthe Organization and all its Members, particularly in\r\nseeking the solution to financial problems, a sine qua non\r\nfor effective progress in the reform process.\r\nDespite the Organization’s commitment to\r\ninternational peace and security, conflicts and fratricidal\r\nwars continue in various parts of the world, causing loss of\r\nlife, massive displacements of population and floods of\r\nrefugees. Africa, unfortunately, continues to furnish tragic\r\nexamples of such scourges. The seriousness of these crises\r\non our continent prompted the Security Council to devote\r\na ministerial meeting to such problems on 25 September of\r\nthis year in an effort to analyse their causes and propose\r\nsuitable solutions.\r\nIn addition to conflicts in Angola, Burundi, Rwanda\r\nand Somalia, there are new tensions and crises in Sierra\r\nLeone, the Republic of the Congo and the Central African\r\nRepublic.\r\nIn respect to Angola, a country with which Guinea-\r\nBissau enjoys a relationship of deep friendship, we\r\nwelcome the progress made there towards restoring peace\r\nand achieving national reconciliation, and we encourage\r\nUNITA to make the efforts necessary to bring to\r\ncompletion the tasks set forth in the Lusaka Protocol.\r\nIn Burundi, the Republic of the Congo, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic and Somalia dialogue must prevail in the\r\nsearch for solutions to the problems that affect those\r\ncountries.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, the United Nations — the Security\r\nCouncil in particular — must support the efforts of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States and OAU to\r\nrestore the democratically elected Government.\r\nIn Liberia, we welcome the holding of free and fair\r\nelections and the return to peace. We urge the\r\ninternational community to continue to provide aid for\r\nreconstruction and the consolidation of peace and\r\ndemocracy in that country.\r\nTurning to Western Sahara, Guinea-Bissau welcomes\r\nthe recent agreement concluded between the various\r\nparties and hopes that this new understanding will lead to\r\na definitive solution to this question through the holding\r\nof a referendum on self-determination.\r\nThe sanctions imposed on Libya by the Security\r\nCouncil in 1992 seriously affect innocent people. Guinea-\r\nBissau encourages the parties concerned to seek, through\r\nnegotiations, a just solution to that question. The joint\r\nproposals of OAU and the League of Arab States merit\r\nthe attention of the international community.\r\nRecent events in the Middle East have weakened the\r\npeace process. We urge the State of Israel and the\r\nPalestinian Authority to continue their dialogue to restore\r\na climate of confidence, which is so essential to the\r\nestablishment of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\r\nin the region.\r\nWe are also concerned at the slow pace of the\r\nimplementation of the peace agreement in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and we appeal to the various parties to show\r\ngreater determination to resolve the conflict.\r\nIn East Timor, we continue to support the\r\nnegotiations conducted under the auspices of the\r\nSecretary-General to find a just and definitive solution to\r\nthis question.\r\nThe embargo imposed on Cuba continues seriously\r\nto affect that country’s people and development process.\r\nWe appeal to the parties to take the necessary steps\r\ntowards a definitive and satisfactory solution to this\r\nproblem.\r\nOn behalf of our Government, we should also like\r\nto reiterate our conviction that the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan deserves to regain its rightful place in the United\r\nNations on the basis of respect for the principle of\r\nuniversality and the sovereign equality of States. The\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, a democratic country of\r\nover 20 million people that has made enormous progress\r\nin the economic and social field and with regard to\r\nrespect for basic human rights, is today a reality that\r\ncannot be ignored. The readmission of the Republic of\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nChina to the United Nations and to all its specialized\r\nagencies would be an important factor for peace, stability\r\nand international cooperation.\r\nMindful of the fact that the United Nations, and the\r\nSecurity Council in particular, play an essential role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, we attach\r\nspecial importance to regional bodies with respect to\r\nconflict prevention and resolution.\r\nIn our subregion, the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States has, with unprecedented success, been\r\nmanaging the crisis in Liberia through the establishment\r\nand deployment of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group. The\r\nsteps undertaken through the Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) deserve special\r\nmention. Given the magnitude and complexity of the\r\nproblems to be resolved, that organ needs increased support\r\nfrom the international community to complete its mission.\r\nIn this context, we believe that any approach to\r\nstrengthening the capacities of African countries to prevent,\r\nmanage and resolve conflicts must be supported. Thus, we\r\nwelcome with interest the joint initiative of the United\r\nStates, France and Great Britain in this area under the aegis\r\nof OAU.\r\nGuinea-Bissau welcomes the adoption in Oslo of a\r\ndraft convention for the complete elimination of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines and urges all countries to accede to it\r\nso that it may enter into force as soon as possible.\r\nThe intolerable persistence of poverty in the world,\r\nparticularly in Africa, requires the ongoing mobilization of\r\nthe international community and the elaboration within\r\ninternational bodies of coherent policies to confront the\r\nmajor problems of development. Given the fact that Africa\r\nhas more least developed countries than any other continent\r\nin the world, the General Assembly’s recent adoption of the\r\nAgenda for Development is of the greatest interest to us.\r\nAfrica continues to suffer the negative effects of the\r\nproblems of external debt, deteriorating terms of trade,\r\ndifficult access for its products to international markets and\r\ndecreased investment. Moreover, the effects of the\r\nglobalization of the economy and the drop in official\r\ndevelopment assistance have reduced the capacity of\r\nAfrican countries to tackle socio-economic problems\r\nsuccessfully. The initiatives of the Paris Club, the World\r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund to provide debt\r\nrelief — initiatives that have already benefited some\r\nAfrican countries — meet our concerns and we hope that\r\nGuinea-Bissau will soon be able to profit by them.\r\nRespect for and the full exercise of fundamental\r\nhuman rights are factors for freedom, peace and\r\nguaranteed internal stability. Guinea-Bissau, which\r\nrecognizes the importance of good governance, pluralistic\r\ndemocracy and a state of law, continues to work for the\r\npreservation of values intrinsic to the dignity of the\r\nindividual and his full, harmonious development. In this\r\nregard, we wish to congratulate Mrs. Mary Robinson on\r\nher timely nomination to the post of United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We wish her every\r\nsuccess in the performance of her duties and call on all\r\nMember States to lend her the support she needs.\r\nThe rational use of our world’s natural resources and\r\nenvironmental protection are responsibilities which, to\r\nvarying degrees, fall to all mankind. Guinea-Bissau has,\r\ntogether with its partners, defined a strategy for\r\nsustainable development that respects ecological balances.\r\nThe disappointing results of the review of the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 at last June’s special\r\nsession of the General Assembly is clear proof that the\r\ninternational community must be much more committed\r\nto defining agreed policies for environmental protection.\r\nThe achievement of the ideals of the United Nations\r\nto which our peoples aspire, the need to reform and\r\nmodernize our Organization, and international cooperative\r\nefforts are all the subjects of our collective thinking and\r\nthe inspiration of our ongoing commitment. Indeed, given\r\nthe challenges of the late twentieth century, our\r\nOrganization continues to embody the greatest hopes of\r\nour peoples for a future of progress, well-being, social\r\njustice and understanding among all peoples.\r\nAs Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, said during the celebration of\r\nthe United Nations fiftieth anniversary:\r\n“I would call for greater ... coordination of our\r\nefforts in order to forge a world Organization\r\ncapable of preserving future generations from the\r\nscourge of war and to give the poorest and most\r\nhelpless true reasons for hope, thus safeguarding the\r\ncommon interests of mankind.” [Official Records of\r\nthe General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 36th meeting, p.9]\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Bhutan, His Excellency Mr. Dawa\r\nTsering.\r\nMr. Tsering (Bhutan): I have the honour to convey to\r\nall representatives the warm greetings and good wishes of\r\nHis Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of Bhutan, for\r\nthe success of the fifty-second session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly.\r\nMay I express, Sir, my heartfelt congratulations on\r\nyour election to the high office of the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that with your vast\r\npersonal experience and in-depth knowledge of the United\r\nNations you will lead our deliberations in this important\r\nsession to a fruitful conclusion.\r\nI would like to express our deep appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for the bold and\r\ninnovative manner in which he led the fifty-first session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay a special\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\ndynamic leadership of our Organization. I wish to\r\ncongratulate him on his comprehensive report on the reform\r\nof the United Nations and also to express our appreciation\r\nto the Executive Coordinator for Reform and his team for\r\ntheir valuable contribution.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly has been widely\r\nregarded as a session for the reform of the United Nations.\r\nI shall therefore confine my remarks to this subject. The\r\nquestion of United Nations reform is not a new issue and\r\nhas been the subject of ongoing discussions. We share the\r\nview that concrete steps must be taken this year so that the\r\nfeeling of uncertainty can be put behind us and we can\r\nconcentrate on other important challenges that confront our\r\nOrganization.\r\nBefore we embark on the task of reforming the United\r\nNations it is important that we first understand what the\r\nUnited Nations means to different Member States. The\r\nUnited Nations is certainly unparalleled in history as a\r\nforum for international dialogue and cooperation, as well as\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nHowever, for many of the larger Members it remains but\r\none of several means of pursuing their national interests.\r\nFor smaller Member countries, however, the United Nations\r\nremains the primary Organization for the protection and\r\nexpression of their sovereignty. Many of them also rely\r\nheavily on the United Nations for their economic and social\r\nadvancement. Any reform of the United Nations must\r\ntherefore take into account the needs and aspirations of\r\nthe majority of its Members, which are small developing\r\ncountries. The United Nations must be able to protect the\r\npolitical independence of its smaller Members and support\r\ntheir social and economic development in order to enable\r\nthem to meet their aspirations for peace and development\r\nwithout undue pressures or interference from outside.\r\nThe proposal for reform submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is significant in that he has not only sought the\r\nviews of Member States but has also taken into account\r\nthe perspective of the United Nations staff, for the\r\nchanges would have a direct bearing on their functions\r\nand responsibilities. In our view, this effort to involve\r\nMembers States as well as the United Nations staff will\r\nprovide a congenial atmosphere in which to discuss\r\nreforms and their subsequent implementation.\r\nWith regard to the reforms, there are clearly areas\r\nwhich fall within the mandate of the Secretary-General.\r\nIt is our view that reforms which are already moving\r\nahead in some areas must be allowed to do so. We find\r\nmerit in clustering together various divisions within the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat in the core areas of peace and\r\nsecurity, humanitarian affairs, economic and social affairs\r\nand human rights. We also find the various coordination\r\nand planning mechanisms being put in place among the\r\nnew broad clusters necessary and useful.\r\nWe look forward to receiving from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral his report on the measures he is taking to\r\nimplement the organizational changes which are within\r\nhis mandate. While the General Assembly and some of\r\nthe existing consultative mechanisms exist and will no\r\ndoubt be used for interaction with the Secretariat, there\r\nshould be mechanisms by which the general membership\r\ncan interact with the newly formed divisions.\r\nThe new post of Deputy Secretary-General is\r\nnecessary in our view, given the formidable number of\r\nresponsibilities that the Secretary-General currently has to\r\nshoulder. The role of the Deputy Secretary-General\r\nshould, however, be clearly defined in the larger interests\r\nof the Organization.\r\nThe question of refocusing the work of the General\r\nAssembly itself is an interesting proposal which we fully\r\nsupport. The long debates in the Assembly, as well as in\r\nnumerous Committees, and the large number of issues\r\nand resolutions, are well beyond the capacity of many of\r\nthe smaller Member countries to handle. We support the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nidea of dealing with thematic issues, both within the\r\nplenary and the Committees, during the annual sessions.\r\nWe also support the view that the follow-up to all\r\nglobal conferences should be properly tied to the work of\r\nthe General Assembly. The resolutions and other decisions\r\nadopted during the General Assembly must be organized in\r\nsuch a manner that they will have a direct bearing on the\r\nwork of the Secretariat, providing both guidance and\r\ndirection.\r\nThe proposed Development Group that has been\r\nconstituted, bringing greater coordination of the three key\r\nUnited Nations development agencies — namely, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA) — is of special interest\r\nto the majority of small developing countries to which the\r\nactivities of these agencies provide significant support. It\r\nmust be recognized that the coordination among these three\r\nagencies must support the ongoing programmes which these\r\nagencies have arrived at with individual countries and that\r\nthe changes should be brought about without any disruption\r\nto the current programmes, both in financial and\r\nprogramming terms.\r\nAs a country which has benefited greatly from the\r\nactivities of UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA, we express our\r\ngratitude to these and other United Nations bodies and\r\nspecialized agencies for their assistance to my country. The\r\nexperience of Bhutan and many smaller developing\r\ncountries clearly indicates that there is a continued role for\r\nthese United Nations bodies and agencies. It is our hope\r\nthat with better coordination within the Development Group\r\nand field-level implementation of their activities there will\r\nbe enhanced financial support by the donor community.\r\nThe proposal by the Secretary-General to have a high-\r\nlevel ministerial commission to review the work of other\r\nUnited Nations agencies and their relationship with the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat is timely. The work\r\nof the specialized agencies is extremely important, and it is\r\ntime their methods of work and their activities were\r\nreviewed so that all United Nations programmes are better\r\nsynchronized.\r\nAll the efforts to reform and revitalize the United\r\nNations will not be possible if the United Nations does not\r\nhave a sound financial position. The financial health of the\r\nUnited Nations must be restored. All members must work\r\nearnestly towards meeting this objective. We welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to create a revolving credit\r\nfund to meet the Organization’s funding. However, the\r\nprimary requirement must be met from the assessed\r\ncontributions of Member States. In this regard, it is our\r\nview that the negotiations on the scale of assessments\r\nmust proceed and be resolved at an early date in a\r\nmanner that is acceptable to all Member States. We also\r\nfirmly believe that all Member States must meet their\r\nfinancial obligations to the Organization through the\r\nunconditional payment of their assessed dues in full and\r\non time. The United Nations must also institute more\r\ndynamic means of fund management, including utilization\r\nof the financial market in a prudent manner. All legal\r\nrestrictions to such management should be reviewed.\r\nOne of the most important issues relating to the\r\nreform of the United Nations remains the membership of\r\nthe Security Council. It is our view that the discussions\r\non this issue, emanating from complex and fundamentally\r\ninequitable premises, have led to the current difficulties.\r\nHowever, the continued status quo does not benefit the\r\nvast majority of Member States. Bhutan fully supports the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement’s position that there must be\r\nexpansion of the permanent membership to include the\r\ndeveloped and developing countries and that there should\r\nbe additional non-permanent seats. The expansion must\r\ntake into account the new security needs and the objective\r\ncriteria, of who would best be able to shoulder the new\r\nresponsibilities. We believe that on the basis of objective\r\ncriteria, Japan, as one of the foremost economic and\r\npolitical powers in the world today, qualifies for\r\npermanent membership. Among developing countries,\r\nIndia’s case merits serious consideration for permanent\r\nmembership due to its massive population — one out of\r\nnearly six people on our planet is an Indian — and its\r\ngreat economic potential, in addition to the fact that India\r\nhas played an active role in all United Nations activities.\r\nDiscussion on the expansion must continue, and we\r\nshould not be deterred by the complex nature of the\r\nsubject. We remain confident that an early and equitable\r\nsolution can be found.\r\nIt is our hope that the reform of the United Nations\r\nand the renewal of the United Nations can be completed\r\nin the two remaining years of this century, so that during\r\nthe millennium session of the General Assembly, in the\r\nyear 2000, we can concentrate on the vision and\r\naspirations of mankind for the twenty-first century.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Suriname, His Excellency Mr. Errol\r\nGlenn Snijders.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nMr. Snijders (Suriname): Allow me to begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of\r\nSuriname, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly. I am convinced\r\nthat under your wise and able guidance our deliberations\r\nwill be fruitful. May I express our appreciation for the\r\nexcellent manner in which your predecessor, Ambassador\r\nRazali Ismail, presided over the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI also take this opportunity to convey our profound\r\nadmiration of and gratitude for the dynamic leadership of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in pursuance of the\r\nnoble objectives of this unique world body in this era in\r\nwhich new challenges and opportunities face humankind.\r\nWe salute his efforts to bring our Organization more in line\r\nwith the pressing demands of our time.\r\nWhen we express our feelings of solidarity with the\r\nless fortunate of the world, our sympathy also goes out to\r\nthe Government and the people of the sister island of\r\nMontserrat as they suffer the consequences of a geologic\r\ndisaster in these dismal days of their history. The important\r\nsupport that the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\ncountries, within their limited possibilities, have given to\r\nMontserrat to help alleviate the pain merits recognition and\r\nis worth following. I therefore seize this opportunity to\r\nappeal to other countries to fulfil their moral obligations to\r\nour brothers and sisters in need.\r\nWithin the context of an increasingly integrated and\r\ncomplex global economic system of production and\r\ndistribution, trade liberalization and globalization of\r\nfinancial markets, the major thrust of the development\r\nstrategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname\r\nlies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and\r\nexport capacity as the main engines of growth while\r\nmaintaining financial and monetary stability.\r\nIn response to the need to diversify the export base of\r\nthe economy, a good deal of impetus was given this year to\r\nthe expansion of the mining sector by the recent opening of\r\nan oil refinery that will enable my country to meet\r\ndomestic demands for heavy oil, by new gold-mining\r\noperations and by the commercial exploitation of other\r\nmineral deposits. Furthermore, we have initiated the\r\nconstruction of two important bridges. Together with the\r\nrehabilitation of vital infrastructure, including access roads\r\nin the coastal area and to the interior of the country and the\r\noperation of a ferry service with our neighbouring country,\r\nthe cooperative Republic of Guyana, these bridges will\r\noffer new opportunities for trade, house construction,\r\ntransport, tourism and employment in Suriname.\r\nIt is often said that progress in building lasting\r\ndemocracies and stronger market economies is\r\nincreasingly threatened by slow growth, weak institutions,\r\npoverty and wealth inequality. Persistent economic\r\nhardships for the majority of the people can likewise\r\ndamage the credibility of democratic Governments. The\r\nstruggle against poverty and social injustice is therefore\r\nthe greatest challenge to the Government of Suriname.\r\nIn our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve\r\npeople-centred development goals, the present\r\nGovernment, within the international constraints of\r\nsustainable development and environmental protection,\r\nwill continue its endeavours to increase domestic\r\nefficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture,\r\nproduction, manufacturing and export, as well as to\r\nstrengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship, with\r\na view to ensuring political stability and fostering\r\nequitable economic growth.\r\nBearing in mind that which has been referred to as\r\nthe dark side of the globalization process, and with a view\r\nto avoiding marginalization and creating outsiders to the\r\nglobal economy, it is imperative that we continue to\r\nrecognize the small, fragile and vulnerable economies of\r\nthe Caribbean, including Suriname, and of other regions\r\nin the world. This should guarantee that they will be\r\ngiven special treatment during a transitional period in\r\nwhich they will still require exceptions, waivers and other\r\ntransitional arrangements in the broader context of\r\ninternational trade liberalization and economic integration.\r\nHence the Surinamese Government attaches special\r\nsignificance to the May 1997 Bridgetown Declaration of\r\nPrinciples on Caribbean Community-United States\r\ncooperation in responding to the challenges that the new\r\nmillennium poses for our region, and it is looking forward\r\nto an expeditious implementation of the Plan of Action\r\nappended thereto. We also attach great importance to the\r\ntimely implementation of the Programme of Action for\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates and are looking forward to the 1998 review session\r\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development on\r\noutstanding chapters and issues of the Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nThe Government of Suriname welcomes the call of\r\nthe United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs for a\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nrenewed and concerted international commitment to a\r\nforward-looking drug strategy for the twenty-first century\r\nand, to that end, the convocation of a special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in June 1998. That session will prepare\r\na global drug-control strategy and new ways to promote\r\ninternational and regional cooperation in the fight against\r\nthe worldwide drug problem that undermines in particular\r\nthe economic and social prospects of many small\r\ndeveloping nations.\r\nWhile Suriname cannot be considered a drug-\r\nproducing country, it is afflicted by this scourge through\r\nproducers from outside the country who misuse its territory\r\nas a transit point for drugs bound for other countries, where\r\nthe availability and extensive use of drugs is creating a\r\nhuge, profitable market that threatens the well-being of so\r\nmany and feeds the greed of but a few.\r\nTo demonstrate our resolve to eradicate this evil from\r\nour territory, we will join with neighbouring countries to\r\ncoordinate our strategies and efforts. For that purpose\r\nSuriname will convene, at the beginning of 1998 and in\r\nconcert with Guyana, Brazil, France and Venezuela, an\r\ninternational conference on defining strategies and actions\r\nagainst the misuse and illicit trafficking of drugs. We\r\nappeal to those who are also committed to this struggle to\r\nassist us in this endeavour.\r\nReflecting on our special session on the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, the Government of Suriname\r\napplauds the adoption in July of this year of the Programme\r\nfor the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, including the\r\nstatement of commitment by Member countries. We expect\r\nthe next comprehensive review of its implementation in the\r\nyear 2002 to demonstrate greater measurable progress in\r\nachieving sustainable development.\r\nThe Government of Suriname feels concern about the\r\nissue of finance for sustainable development. Since Rio\r\n1992, only four developed States have fulfilled their\r\nAgenda 21 commitment towards the target of providing 0.7\r\nper cent of their gross national product as official\r\ndevelopment assistance. As it was agreed that for most\r\ndeveloping countries official development assistance is still\r\na main source of external development financing and cannot\r\ngenerally be replaced by private capital inflows, I should\r\nlike to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to\r\nreverse the declining trend in official development\r\nassistance as we experience it today.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to pose a\r\ngreat threat to international peace and security. The Oslo\r\nagreement of 1993, signed by the two parties, embodies\r\nthe hope that a lasting solution to this conflict is within\r\nreach, since it establishes the basis for a lasting peace in\r\nthe Middle East. We feel that the peace process must be\r\ncarried on urgently, with a well-defined timetable. We\r\ntherefore support the co-sponsors of the peace process in\r\ntheir effort to bring the parties back to the negotiating\r\ntable with a view to securing durable peace in the Middle\r\nEast.\r\nAllow me to make a few remarks on the important\r\nissues of the reform and strengthening of the United\r\nNations and of more equitable representation in the\r\nSecurity Council. Since its birth, our Organization has\r\ngrown from 5 to 185 Member States, but the Security\r\nCouncil still reflects the world as it was in 1945. The\r\nGovernment of Suriname therefore underscores the need\r\nfor an expansion of, and a more equitable representation\r\nin, the membership of the Security Council.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should not only\r\nmake the Council’s membership more representative and\r\nmore legitimate but should also enhance its transparency\r\nand openness towards other Member States and non-\r\nmembers in order to convey its important messages in an\r\namplified and more effective manner. Hence we welcome\r\nthe recent measures taken by the Council to enhance its\r\ntransparency.\r\nThe present Government of Suriname takes the\r\nposition that the countries of the Caribbean and Latin\r\nAmerica should be included in any agreed expansion of\r\nthe Council, within the context of the principles of\r\nequitable geographic distribution and the sovereign\r\nequality of States. The reform should not result in\r\ndiscriminatory treatment between the developed and the\r\ndeveloping countries. We furthermore consider as integral\r\nparts of Security Council reform its expansion, the reform\r\nof its working methods and the issue of the veto. The\r\nveto should preferably be restricted to issues falling under\r\nChapter VII of our Charter.\r\nIncreased globalization and the emergence of new\r\nchallenges and threats require closer cooperation between\r\nStates at a global level. Within this context, it is of\r\nutmost importance to reaffirm and maintain the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as a major actor in cooperation between\r\nStates, especially development cooperation. In this light,\r\nmy Government welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to propose a comprehensive reform programme\r\nto the General Assembly which is geared towards\r\nstrengthening the efficiency of the Secretariat and fixing\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\na stronger focus on economic and social development\r\nissues.\r\nThe Government of Suriname supports in general the\r\nreform proposals of the Secretary-General and their key\r\nelements. These reform proposals as a whole represent a\r\ntimely and welcome initiative, given the fact that in today’s\r\nworld the need has progressively increased for global\r\ncommon action on a number of pressing problems, such as\r\nthe eradication of poverty, humanitarian emergencies,\r\nrefugee problems, climate change and desertification,\r\ndiminishing official development assistance funding, drugs,\r\nnuclear disarmament, the implementation of Agenda 21,\r\ndemocracy and the maintenance of peace and security in\r\nvarious regions of the world.\r\nAll this calls for a stronger United Nations to promote\r\na renewed multilateral cooperation based on common\r\ninterests and shared responsibility. We must empower the\r\nUnited Nations now so that it can confront the global\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nOne of the best ways to re-establish trust in the United\r\nNations is to enhance the impact of United Nations\r\ndevelopment activities at the country level. In this regard\r\nthe Surinamese Government endorses the proposal to\r\nestablish a “United Nations House”.\r\nIn closing, I wish to reiterate that the Government of\r\nthe Republic of Suriname is committed to contributing to\r\nthe ongoing process of reform of our Organization.\r\nWe see the reform proposals of the Secretary-General\r\nas a first step in the right direction, although much more is\r\nleft to be done. We feel that the United Nations system\r\nshould be made stronger, more effective and more efficient\r\nin order to meet the priorities set by all its Members — not\r\njust the priorities of the economically strong and the\r\nmilitarily powerful but, especially, the priorities of the weak\r\nand vulnerable States, which should be prevented from\r\nbecoming outsiders in the global economy.\r\nThe President: I call next on The Honourable\r\nLieutenant-General Mompati S. Merafhe, MP, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Botswana.\r\nMr. Merafhe (Botswana): Allow me, Sir, to express\r\nto you and to your delegation our sincere congratulations on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-second session. As you are an experienced United\r\nNations diplomat, we entertain great expectations of your\r\ntenure of office as President of the Assembly.\r\nWe wish also to pay tribute to the outgoing\r\nPresident, His Excellency Ambassador Razali Ismail of\r\nMalaysia, whose stewardship of the fifty-first session will\r\nforever be remembered for its creativity and dynamism.\r\nWe wish him well and thank him and his country,\r\nMalaysia, for a job well done.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, deserves in\r\nample measure our gratitude for the professionalism he\r\nhas demonstrated thus far in his leadership of the United\r\nNations. His reports on the work of the Organization and\r\non the wide-ranging reform of the United Nations system\r\nrenew the confidence and trust we reposed in him when\r\nwe elected him only nine months ago.\r\nWe live in a rapidly changing world. The past few\r\nyears have witnessed an unprecedented expansion of\r\nworld trade and commerce, and the trend continues\r\nunabated. National boundaries are being transcended with\r\nease in the interaction of national economies through a\r\nprocess which has been christened globalization. In the\r\ninternational political arena, there is increasing unanimity\r\namongst the community of nations and other global actors\r\nthat narrow national interests should be superseded by\r\nuniversal interests.\r\nThese complex changes in the world outlook call for\r\nan enhanced role for the United Nations in international\r\naffairs lest change become brutal, especially for the\r\ndeveloping countries. The United Nations has gained new\r\ninternational stature in recent years, thanks to the\r\nextirpation of the politics of paralysis of the cold-war era.\r\n“Blue Helmets” are today being deployed in situations\r\nformerly considered to be outside the range of the\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nThe United Nations has also built international\r\nconsensus through a series of conferences and meetings\r\non areas and issues as diverse as women and\r\ndevelopment, youth, the environment, human rights,\r\nageing, population, social development and human\r\nsettlements, education and health, the outcome of which\r\nwill guide the thinking and actions of the international\r\ncommunity into the next millennium. Furthermore, the\r\nUnited Nations has proved its capability to deal\r\neffectively with the serious threats posed by nuclear,\r\nchemical and biological weapons, a capability which is\r\noften frustrated by a lack of political will and\r\ncommitment on the part of Member States.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nIn short, in the present-day reality, no one country, big\r\nor small, rich or poor, weak or powerful, can exist in\r\nisolation or act unilaterally without suffering the\r\nconsequences of its actions. Terrorism, drug trafficking,\r\ncross-border crime, the depletion of the ozone layer, acid\r\nrain, receding rain forests, advancing deserts, diminishing\r\nfresh-water reserves, poverty, disease and many more\r\nrecognize no national boundaries; only collective action by\r\nthe States Members of the Organization can arrest and\r\nreverse their advance.\r\nThe United Nations is the mother of genuine\r\nmultilateralism, and it should occupy centre stage in our\r\nthinking about international relations. The heavy\r\nresponsibilities reposed in the world body by present-day\r\ninternational realities demand that the United Nations\r\nsystem should undergo substantial reform if it is to respond\r\nmore efficiently and effectively to the needs and concerns\r\nof its Member States and their peoples, now and in the\r\nfuture. The United Nations system needs to be streamlined\r\nto remove administrative bottlenecks, weed out corruption\r\nand other malpractices and eliminate duplication in the\r\nactivities of its organs, agencies, programmes, funds and\r\noffices.\r\nIt is in that spirit that Botswana welcomes the recent\r\nreform initiatives of the Secretary-General as the basis for\r\nfurther discussion and debate on the reform process. My\r\ndelegation will have occasion to pronounce itself on the\r\nvarious elements of the reform package in due course. At\r\nthis juncture, I can only observe that Botswana is disposed\r\nto a holistic consideration of the package by the General\r\nAssembly. The reform proposals constitute a single unit,\r\nand its constituent parts should be discussed with that\r\nunderstanding in mind.\r\nThis means, therefore, that those elements of the\r\npackage — the greatest number, we would hope — which\r\nare acceptable to the majority of delegations, or on which\r\ngeneral consensus is attained, should be implemented\r\nforthwith. True, many of the proposals are indeed\r\nrevolutionary, as the Secretary-General himself concedes,\r\nand, if approved, they would in a positive sense change\r\npermanently the way the Organization operates. The reform\r\npackage is the broadest and most extensive in the history of\r\nthe United Nations and, in my view, is an appropriate\r\nresponse to the magnitude of the clamour for reform which\r\nhas echoed through the halls of this Organization and which\r\nfor some time now has even threatened its very existence.\r\nIt would have been the height of absurdity for my\r\ndelegation to have expected the whole reform package to be\r\nagreeable or acceptable to every delegation in this Hall,\r\nbut I find the arguments and complaints from some\r\nquarters that the package does not go far enough\r\npreposterous to say the least. Reform, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral rightly reminds us, is not an event but a process.\r\nReform should not and must not be apocalyptic. It cannot\r\nand must not become synonymous with the downsizing of\r\nthe Organization to the extent that it would deprive it of\r\nthe requisite human and material resources to render\r\nservices to Member States, especially the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nSuch reform would be inimical to the efficacy of the\r\nUnited Nations. Reform should lead to a more efficient,\r\nmore effective and more relevant United Nations, that is\r\na United Nations with a capacity to foresee and respond\r\nadequately and expeditiously to imminent disaster\r\nsituations around the world and to other needs and\r\nconcerns of humankind today.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s reform proposals have\r\nsignalled the direction to take in the reform process; it is\r\nthe collaborative response of the Member States which is\r\nawaited. I believe we are all very serious about reform of\r\nthe United Nations; now is the time to approve and\r\nimplement those reform proposals on which there is\r\ngeneral consensus. Our commitment, seriousness and\r\nsincerity about United Nations reform would increasingly\r\nbe called into doubt if by the beginning of the fifty-third\r\nsession of the Assembly we had not implemented any of\r\nthe reform proposals contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreform package.\r\nMr. Young (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nNo one country, region or group of countries can\r\narrogate to itself the right to dictate the reform agenda.\r\nWhat should be established is a balanced, equitable and\r\nnon-discriminatory reform agenda in which the common\r\nwishes and interests of every Member State can find\r\nexpression. This is the guiding principle my delegation\r\nwill follow in its contribution to the ongoing reform\r\nprocess.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s reform package is not the\r\nonly momentous issue in the United Nations reform\r\nprocess. Close to four years have elapsed, and the debate\r\non Security Council reform continues without an end in\r\nsight. It is obvious that, unless we can suddenly acquire\r\nSolomonic wisdom, we are unlikely to come to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion of this debate in another four years\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nor even much longer. Yet there has emerged a body of\r\nthought which favours an increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmember categories, to reflect the configuration of today’s\r\ninternational political realities.\r\nBotswana was a member of the Security Council until\r\nthe end of last year, and we are convinced more than ever\r\nbefore that the composition of the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, as well as its working methods and\r\nprocedures, needs reform. It is time for the debate on\r\nSecurity Council reform to be brought to a successful\r\nconclusion, so that all geographical regions can be equitably\r\nrepresented in the Council. We should not allow the debate\r\nto become sterile or degenerate into a dialogue between the\r\ndeaf and the dumb.\r\nThe financial health of the Organization is another\r\nissue which remains a source of deep concern and anguish\r\nto my delegation. The United Nations cannot be expected\r\nto deliver the goods without the necessary financial\r\nlifeblood. In other words, the United Nations cannot operate\r\non the basis of a shoestring budget and be expected to carry\r\nout the heavy responsibilities imposed on it every day by\r\nMember States. It is therefore imperative that each and\r\nevery Member State should meet its financial obligations to\r\nthis Organization on time, in full and without any\r\nconditionalities, and clear all its arrears as a matter of\r\nurgency.\r\nThe international community has made considerable\r\nprogress in the struggle for democracy around the world\r\nsince the end of the cold war. Today, peoples and nations\r\nacross the spectrum of the African continent live in relative\r\npeace and tranquillity and are engaged in the reconstruction\r\nof their national economies, thanks to the emergence of a\r\ndemocratic culture. In spite of these positive developments,\r\nthe reality is that Africa is still bedeviled by deadly\r\nconflicts.\r\nHowever, we are happy to acknowledge that fighting\r\nhas ceased in Liberia. The Liberian people have at long last\r\nfreely chosen their leaders, and their verdict was respected.\r\nThe long-suffering and economically plundered\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo today enjoys relative\r\npeace and security after a short but devastating crisis that\r\nended with the overthrow of a 32-year dictatorship. The\r\npeople of the Democratic Republic of Congo need the\r\nunderstanding and sympathy of the international community\r\nas they grapple with the reconstruction of their country.\r\nThe final settlement of the conflict in Angola\r\ncontinues to elude the international community, but, thank\r\nGod, there has been no resumption of hostilities so far.\r\nProgress is painfully slow, due to the failure by UNITA\r\nto honour its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol, and\r\nespecially its refusal to disarm and demobilize its forces.\r\nThe United Nations should monitor the situation in\r\nAngola very closely to ensure that the present slow\r\nprogress does not assume a state of permanence or lead\r\nto a reversal of the gains made so far under the Lusaka\r\nprocess.\r\nThe international community should continue to pay\r\ncloser attention to the situation in Somalia and help the\r\nSomali parties hold a peace conference through which\r\nthey can settle, once and for all, their long-running\r\nfratricidal conflict.\r\nThere is a renewed sense of expectation that the\r\nefforts deployed to resolve the conflict in Western Sahara\r\nwill bear fruit. It is our hope and wish that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, through his Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker,\r\nwill achieve a breakthrough which will lead to the final\r\nsettlement of the Western Sahara conflict in the very near\r\nfuture.\r\nThe situation in Sierra Leone is troubling. The\r\noverthrow of a democratically elected Government in\r\nSierra Leone five months ago was a most unfortunate\r\nreversal of the political gains that had been achieved in\r\nthat country. The international community has taken the\r\ncorrect line in making it clear that it will no longer\r\ntolerate any military dictatorships. The rejection and\r\nisolation of the military junta in Sierra Leone should\r\nserve as a warning to military leaders with similar designs\r\nthat military rule is unacceptable, whatever the\r\njustification. The ballot, and not the bullet, should be the\r\nonly way through which political leadership can change\r\nhands.\r\nWhile the situation in the Balkans remains generally\r\ntense, there is a light at the end of the tunnel signalling\r\nthe arrival of a new era of national reconciliation in the\r\nconstituent States of the former Yugoslavia. The time has\r\ncome for the various ethnic groups in the former\r\nYugoslavia to realize that none of their countries can exist\r\nas an ethnically pure State without causing political\r\ntensions and reawakening centuries-old hatreds. Their\r\nfuture and destinies are, fortunately or unfortunately,\r\ninextricably intertwined by reason of geography and\r\nhistory. They should accept their fate for what it is.\r\nConflict and war have failed to resolve the ethnic\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\ncomposition of these States in the past, and are unlikely to\r\nresolve them in the future.\r\nWe salute the Secretary-General for his recent\r\ninitiative which brought together the leaders of the two\r\nsides in the Cyprus conflict in New York for talks. We\r\nencourage him to continue his good offices until the parties\r\nreach a final solution to this decades old conflict.\r\nBotswana supports the Middle East peace process.\r\nExperience has shown that peace in that complex cauldron\r\nof conflict cannot be achieved through war and bloodshed.\r\nOnly painstaking and rigorous negotiations conducted in an\r\natmosphere of give and take can lead to the desired result:\r\nthe peace that everyone is yearning for in the Middle East.\r\nWe hope that the State of Israel will realize the\r\ninsensitivity of the construction of new settlements on\r\nPalestinian lands. This has contributed in no small measure\r\nto the current crisis in the Middle East peace process. No\r\neffort should be spared to put the Middle East peace\r\nprocess back on track so that the hopes and aspirations of\r\nthe ordinary peoples of that region to live together in peace\r\nas good neighbours may be realized.\r\nWe welcome the ongoing talks between the two\r\nKoreas, in which China and the United States are also\r\nparticipants. It is our ardent hope that the talks will lead to\r\na decrease in political tensions in the Korean peninsula, and\r\nthat the two Koreas will henceforth establish some common\r\nground which will assist in the eventual reunification of\r\ntheir divided country.\r\nI wish to welcome the recent conclusion of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\r\nTheir Destruction. I wish the Convention enjoyed the\r\nsupport of all nations. Anti-personnel mines are diabolical\r\nand cowardly instruments of warfare which indiscriminately\r\nkill and maim their unsuspecting victims. They should have\r\nbeen banned a long time ago, before they claimed more\r\nlives and maimed many people. It is our fervent desire that\r\nthe Convention will soon enjoy the support of all Member\r\nStates. It is hoped that the experience gained in the\r\ncampaign for the elaboration and conclusion of this\r\nConvention will be extended to all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nSeveral developing countries are still wrestling with\r\ndaunting economic and social problems. The number of\r\ncountries whose people still live in abject poverty and lack\r\nbasic nourishment is on the rise, especially in Africa.\r\nRegrettably, multilateral assistance is declining rapidly in\r\nrelation to the rising poverty in the developing countries.\r\nOnly a handful of developed countries meet the agreed\r\ngoal of 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official\r\ndevelopment assistance. At the same time, private capital\r\nflows have been directed to only a few countries. The\r\nUnited Nations funds and programmes are also unable to\r\nimplement their respective mandates due to lack of\r\nresources. It is important that this trend be not only\r\narrested but reversed through strengthened international\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nFor meaningful development to take root in the\r\ndeveloping countries, an enabling international\r\nenvironment should be established which can address\r\nsuch issues as macroeconomic stability, more open trade\r\nregimes in developed countries, stable financial systems,\r\nreasonable debt initiatives, such as those proposed under\r\nthe World Bank’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\nInitiative, and greater financial flows from developed\r\ncountries to the developing countries. The international\r\ncommunity must also make concerted efforts to support\r\nthe development programmes of the developing countries\r\nin capacity-building, infrastructure and manpower\r\ndevelopment.\r\nObviously, there will be an absolute need for a\r\nturnaround in the political and economic orientation of the\r\ndeveloped countries in favour of global prosperity if these\r\nobjectives are to be realized. It is such enlightened\r\nthinking, which promises economic and political rewards\r\nto the greatest number of the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations, which is absent in the development\r\nbureaucracies of many developed countries.\r\nAs always, our faith in the United Nations as a\r\nrepository of the hopes and aspirations of humankind is\r\ngenuine, deep-rooted and unassailable. We are a young\r\nand developing country in a troubled world — a world\r\ncaught between the extremes of rampant globalization and\r\nresurgent isolationism. Our survival rests with this global\r\nOrganization and its Charter, to which we pledge our\r\nunstinting commitment and loyalty.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Legal Affairs and Local Government\r\nof Grenada, His Excellency The Honourable Raphael\r\nFletcher.\r\nMr. Fletcher (Grenada): In my address to this noble\r\nAssembly last year, I drew attention to the significance of\r\nvirtue and, furthermore, to the enhancement of the release\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nof the power which resides in virtue, through the supply of\r\nappropriate means. Moreover, I invited reflection on the\r\nquintessential sameness of all humankind and urged that\r\nthis, together with a genuine commitment to virtue, be\r\nadopted as the guiding principles of the General Assembly\r\nas it addresses and deliberates upon the realities of human\r\ninteraction in our contemporary world.\r\nAs it is for any individual society or nation, so it is for\r\nthe international global community. Ethics is the science\r\nwhose aim is to produce the good man and woman, while\r\npolitics is the science which aims at fashioning the good\r\nsociety. Thus, politics must be founded upon and\r\nunceasingly informed by ethics.\r\nDoubtless this is an ideal. Nonetheless, it is an ideal\r\nwe must constantly strive to achieve if we are to realize\r\npeace within and among our nations — peace, which was\r\ndescribed by Thomas Aquinas as the tranquillity of order.\r\nIn this era of accelerating change in so many areas in\r\nevery portion of our diverse global community, it is of\r\nsingular importance to the well-being of each of our\r\nindividual national communities, as it is for the overall\r\ninternational global community, that we recognize, observe\r\nand be faithful to those values and principles which,\r\ninherently, are unchanging.\r\nOne such unchanging value is that of right — moral\r\nright: what Plato conceived of as the virtue of justice, and\r\nwhat in Roman law was characterized as the jus, or moral\r\nlaw. Indeed, it is rather significant that Plato perceived the\r\nwhole function of education as being to elicit the best\r\nthings that are latent in the soul, and to do so by directing\r\nthe soul to the right things.\r\nI am highly honoured and deeply pleased to address,\r\non behalf of the Government and the people of Grenada,\r\nthis Assembly at its fifty-second regular session, during the\r\ncourse of which change must be a transcending theme, as\r\nalso must be the initiation, institution and prudent\r\nmanagement of change in the pursuit and conduct of\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I express to this\r\nAssembly the warm greetings of the Government and the\r\npeople of Grenada. I also express our sincere\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his accession to the\r\noffice of Secretary-General, as well as on his manner of\r\naddressing the duties deriving therefrom. We rejoice in his\r\ndemonstration of virtue, and we believe that his profound\r\nknowledge of the United Nations augurs well for his\r\nleadership in pursuance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMy Government is heartened by his commitment to\r\nthe reform of the Organization and is reassured by his\r\nefforts to fashion a more effective and efficient United\r\nNations system. We are hopeful that one of the benefits\r\nwhich will accrue from such an improved system will be\r\nthe enhancement of the economic viability of small\r\ndeveloping States, such as ours; and we further hope that\r\nhis efforts to realize the system envisaged will not be\r\nfrustrated by the withholding of the substantial overall\r\npayments which are due.\r\nMy delegation joins me in extending warm\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-second session. We commend Mr. Razali Ismail\r\nof Malaysia for his exemplary conduct of the proceedings\r\nof the fifty-first session.\r\nThe rapidly changing global environment presents\r\ngrave challenges to small States, especially small island\r\nStates such as Grenada. It also does so for the United\r\nNations, whose very institution was prompted by the\r\nadoption of the ethic of a confraternity of nations\r\ninformed by a common subscription to the concept of the\r\nempowerment of virtue through the furnishing of adequate\r\nand appropriate means in order that right might prevail in\r\nthe international community.\r\nIn this latter regard, attention is especially invited to\r\nthe notion of global trade and liberalization as it is\r\ncurrently regulated by the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO), with its inherent inconsistencies, which operate\r\nto the disadvantage of the smaller economies. The WTO\r\nrules relating now to the products of agriculture and agro-\r\nindustry bear testimony to the injustice inflicted upon\r\nthose of us who live and labour within the confines of\r\nsmall economies — witness the recent ruling on bananas,\r\nwhich underscores the insensitivity displayed by way of\r\nthe challenge which triggered it.\r\nMoreover, the Uruguay Round Agreements require\r\na massive legislative agenda on Grenada’s part — as they\r\nundoubtedly do for most developing countries. Our\r\nnational laws in the areas of trade in goods and services\r\nas well as intellectual property must be reviewed and\r\nextensive legislative changes made. Thus we must acquire\r\nthe necessary legal expertise to work on this project until\r\nimplementation is fully accomplished - and all this by the\r\nend of the year 2000.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nWe shall, of course, make full use of the assistance\r\nthat is available through WTO as well as that offered by\r\ninternational bodies such as the World Intellectual Property\r\nOrganization (WIPO).\r\nNonetheless, it must be explicitly stated that, in\r\nGrenada’s view, the Uruguay Round Agreements have\r\ncreated for small developing States significantly more\r\nburdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring\r\nunder the banner of global free trade — at least now, and\r\nfor the foreseeable future, unless corrective measures are\r\nsoon instituted.\r\nMy Government continues in its efforts to restructure\r\nthe Grenada economy and is pursuing a programme of\r\neconomic diversification. This involves broadening and\r\nenhancing sectors such as agro-processing, light\r\nmanufacturing, crafts, services — including offshore\r\nfinancial services — tourism and agriculture.\r\nNevertheless, my Government is deeply aware that the\r\nsuccess of its economic policies will depend significantly\r\non the support of the multilateral financial institutions and\r\nalso of friendly countries in respect of training and the\r\ndissemination of knowledge and skills, as well as the\r\nsetting up of enterprises and facilities that are strategic to\r\nsecondary economic growth.\r\nAccordingly, my Government is pleased to have\r\nrecorded in the annals of the Assembly, its gratitude for,\r\nand appreciation of, the assistance which Grenada has so\r\nfar received, as well as that which we are currently\r\nreceiving, from the European Union through the Lomé\r\nAgreement, and from other friendly countries.\r\nDespite constraints such as I have referred to, as well\r\nas others, my Government continues in its efforts to\r\nstimulate employment and enhance employability. In the\r\nlatter regard, we are now in the process of institutionalizing\r\non-the-job training for our unemployed youth, whilst\r\nexpanding our formal programmes for skills training. As for\r\nstimulating employment, special emphasis is being placed\r\non self-employment — and this by way of fostering the\r\nsmall enterprise and micro-enterprise sectors. For we are\r\nconvinced that the development of these sectors is crucial\r\nto our preferred process for national development. We\r\nbelieve that through such endeavours our people will grow\r\nin dignity and self-reliance.\r\nMy Government will continue to provide an enabling\r\nenvironment for the private sector to thrive and expand.\r\nAnd we seek the active partnership of the multilateral\r\ninstitutions as well as of the international community,\r\nthrough joint ventures, technological transfers and\r\nfinancial and technical assistance to provide the impetus\r\nto sustained economic growth.\r\nDemocracy and good governance can flourish only\r\nin an environment of peace — an environment\r\ncharacterized by the tranquillity of order; not an order that\r\nis imposed, but an order which springs from mutual trust\r\nand mutual regard amongst the individuals who compose\r\nthe particular society; an order which is constantly\r\nrevitalized and continually enhanced by mutual love; an\r\norder which resonates to the truth that “My origin is their\r\norigin, my conscience is their conscience, my contention\r\nis their contention, and my pilgrimage is their\r\npilgrimage”. In this context, we invite attention to the\r\napparent emergence recently of terrorism in the Caribbean\r\nregion, with the bombings in Cuba.\r\nThe kind of order referred to would inherently\r\ninvolve individual social and economic well-being: true\r\nprosperity, individual and societal.\r\nAt the international global community level, such\r\norder is realizable only by way of a concept and praxis\r\nfor a new global human order such as was enunciated by\r\nthe late President Cheddi Jagan of Guyana and\r\ncorroborated by the leaders of the Group of 7 countries in\r\ntheir communiqué “Making a Success of Globalization for\r\nthe Benefit of All” (A/51/208, annex II).\r\nThe pursuit of true politics in relation to the\r\nfashioning of the confraternity of nations requires that we\r\nstrive to institute such a new global human order.\r\nWithin the compass of such a global human order,\r\nthere inevitably would be the eradication of the crippling\r\nand strangulating debt burden which afflicts so\r\ndevastatingly the very poor and so dehumanizingly the\r\npoorest countries of our world. So also would be action\r\nagainst environmental degradation, and towards\r\nsustainable economic development, especially in the\r\npoorer countries and particularly in small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nSimilarly, as to the eradication of poverty\r\nworldwide — and, in this regard it is fitting that I repeat\r\nhere the observation of the Right Honourable Clare Short,\r\nUnited Kingdom Secretary of State for International\r\nDevelopment:\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\n“A world that has one in five of its people living\r\nin abject poverty is certainly not just and it is also\r\ndangerously unstable”.\r\nNatural disasters, particularly in small island States,\r\nrequire special concern on the part of the confraternity of\r\nnations. The devastation recently experienced in Montserrat\r\ntrumpets the need for a United Nations programme to deal\r\nwith the aftermath of such natural destruction.\r\nGrenada welcomes the recent United Nations initiative\r\nin respect of Haiti, and salutes every country participating\r\nin this noble endeavour, as well as the United Nations and\r\nits officers, whose vision informed that initiative.\r\nWe welcome also the steps towards achieving peace\r\nbetween parties in countries in Central America, and we\r\napplaud them. Indeed, as the current Chairman of the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States, Grenada rejoices in such\r\naction. For, through the Association, we in the Caribbean\r\nregion seek to widen and deepen the process of integration\r\namongst the island States of the Caribbean and those\r\nmainland States whose shores are lapped by the Caribbean\r\nSea — and this includes Cuba.\r\nMy Government is acutely mindful that poor States are\r\npeculiarly vulnerable to the violation of their territorial\r\nintegrity, since they can ill afford the wherewithal to ensure\r\nnon-encroachment in the vicinity of their borders. And the\r\nlarger such poor continental States are, the greater that\r\nparticular vulnerability.\r\nSimilarly, for small island States, in particular those of\r\nthe Caribbean, where the threat is not so much to territorial\r\nintegrity but to security, that threat is posed by those\r\nengaged in the illicit business of narcotics trafficking, both\r\nby way of buying and selling. Our small island States of\r\nthe Caribbean have become primary and secondary\r\ntransshipment centres en route from the large producers to\r\nthe commensurately large consumers. My Government\r\ntherefore asks earnestly that this noble Assembly address\r\nthis matter in accordance with the ethic of the true politics\r\nrelating to the overall international community of\r\nhumankind.\r\nThe current United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme is indeed commendable, and Grenada is pleased\r\nto be actively participating in it at the pace we can best\r\nafford.\r\nNonetheless, it cannot but be admitted that this\r\nProgramme does not offer, much less provide, the\r\nprotection which is needed for our people — particularly\r\nour youth — against the ravishment of drug use and the\r\nblight which eventually afflicts the small-scale\r\ntransporters, or so-called mules. Surely this process of\r\ntransshipment can be severely curtailed, if not completely\r\neradicated, through planned, concerted international\r\naction.\r\nMy Government’s concern for youth and children is\r\nnot confined to Grenada. Nor is it limited to our brothers\r\nand sisters in the Caribbean Community or in the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States. Our concern embraces\r\nyouth and children everywhere. Accordingly, we condemn\r\nthe exploitation of youth and children in any form. We\r\nsay no to the abuse of children for pornography and\r\nprostitution.\r\nMy Government welcomes the recent conclusion of\r\nthe Convention on the comprehensive banning of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, and we urge a significant\r\nacceleration in the controlled destruction of those mines\r\nwhich are relics of campaigns of war of one scale or\r\nanother.\r\nIn relation to the Security Council, Grenada\r\nunequivocally supports its expansion in a manner such as\r\nwould facilitate the realization of true politics in the\r\noverall international community. This, we believe, would\r\ninvolve an increase in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories of membership.\r\nBoth such increases, in our view, should be\r\ncharacterized by a significant presence of developing\r\ncountries. For, in Grenada’s view, what is required in the\r\nreformed Security Council is not more of the same kind\r\nof distribution of perception, but more equity among the\r\ncomponent parts of the spectrum of perception.\r\nThe very notion of equity inevitably calls forth the\r\nnotion of justice. In the context of justice in the United\r\nNations, there arises quite effortlessly the case of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. To all who subscribe to the\r\nprinciple of the right of a people to self-determination, the\r\ncase for membership in the United Nations for the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan is a compelling one.\r\nIndeed, it is incontestable. For, some 50 years ago, these\r\npeople chose self-determination. They voted with their\r\nfeet as they moved from their homes on mainland China\r\nto the island of Taiwan, and today 21.3 million people\r\npractise democracy in the Republic of China on Taiwan.\r\nTheir economic achievements are well and widely known,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nas is their willingness to participate in the international\r\ncommunity as a Member of the United Nations.\r\nWhat more is required for the Republic of China to be\r\nadmitted to United Nations membership? One may well\r\nask. My answer: justice. The mention of justice evokes\r\nrecollection of two very insightful observations which\r\ndeserve to be shared in this noble Assembly. First,\r\nReinhold Niebur, in his Foreword to “The Children of Light\r\nand the Children of Darkness”, offered the following\r\ncomment on justice:\r\n“Man’s capacity for justice makes democracy\r\npossible; but Man’s inclination to injustice makes\r\ndemocracy necessary.”\r\nWell might we enquire as to the origin of this\r\ninclination to injustice. But the success or failure to identify\r\nthat origin notwithstanding, an effective manner of dealing\r\nwith that inclination is provided by Plato’s construct for\r\neducation, which is centred on exposure of the soul to the\r\nright things.\r\nAnd second, in his Foreword to Allan Bloom’s\r\nthought-provoking study on American higher education —\r\nthe number-one bestseller of its time, one decade ago, Saul\r\nBellow offered a view that is particularly pertinent to the\r\nnotion of exposure of the soul to the right things. Saul\r\nBellow contends that:\r\n“In the greatest confusion there is an open channel to\r\nthe soul ... The channel is always there, and it is our\r\nbusiness to keep it open, to have access to the deepest\r\npart of ourselves — to that part of us which is\r\nconscious of a higher consciousness ... The soul has to\r\nfind and hold its ground against hostile forces,\r\nsometimes embodied in ideas which frequently deny\r\nits very existence, and which indeed often seem to be\r\ntrying to annul it altogether.”\r\nThe Assembly may well ask, “How does the soul hold\r\nits ground?” My reply: through virtue and constant\r\nexposure to the right things. Let right prevail.\r\nMay God bless the President of, and everyone\r\nparticipating in, this fifty-second regular session of this\r\nnoble Assembly, which through His grace will be a\r\ntransforming blessing to our world.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin the general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind\r\nmembers that statements in exercise of the right of reply\r\nare limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second intervention and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Matuszewski (Poland): The Foreign Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Belarus, in his statement to the Assembly\r\non 2 October 1997, made a number of references to the\r\nprocess of the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) and how it is perceived by the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Belarus.\r\nWe have asked to speak in exercise of the right of\r\nreply not to engage in polemics, since we are aware of\r\nthe fact that Belarus has its own distinctive position on\r\nthis subject. We are, nevertheless, bemused by the way\r\nthe Foreign Minister chose to express his country’s\r\nposition. He stated, in particular:\r\n“In the event that we had on our western borders not\r\nthe friendly sovereign Polish State we have now but\r\na military organization, it would certainly push us to\r\nseriously analyse and reconsider our national\r\nsecurity considerations.” [See Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 21st meeting]\r\nHaving heard such a statement, one is at least\r\nentitled to pose some serious questions. Did the Foreign\r\nMinister want to imply that the friendly sovereign\r\nRepublic of Poland to which he made reference might\r\nsuddenly disappear, to be replaced by what he\r\ncharacterized as a military organization? And, if so, what\r\nmakes him believe that?\r\nIf the Foreign Minister of Belarus, in the portion of\r\nhis statement to which I have just referred, meant to refer\r\nto the implications of Poland’s entry into the North\r\nAtlantic Alliance, we would like to assure him of the\r\nfollowing: Poland, as a member of NATO, will continue\r\nto be a sovereign and friendly neighbour of Belarus.\r\nAnything that attempts to imply the contrary is, for us,\r\nunacceptable. We hope that the wording chosen by the\r\nForeign Minister of Belarus was not meant to make such\r\nan attempt.\r\nThe good-neighbourly and friendly relations between\r\nPoland and Belarus constitute an important historic asset.\r\nPoland will spare no efforts to foster them. We would\r\nlike to assure our Belarusian friends that to have a\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nfriendly sovereign State as a neighbour is undoubtedly a\r\nmutual desire.\r\nMr. Ndaruzaniye (Burundi) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): On Friday, 3 October 1997, at the end of the day,\r\nwe heard a statement by the Permanent Representative of\r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania, speaking in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply to the statement made in the General\r\nAssembly on 2 October 1997 by the Minister for External\r\nRelations and Cooperation of Burundi.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I will not go back over\r\nall the points my colleague made, but I would like simply\r\nat the outset to welcome the interest that Tanzania and the\r\ninternational community have shown in helping the people\r\nand the Government of Burundi in their efforts to move\r\nbeyond the crisis that has now lasted for nearly four years.\r\nIn those efforts, the people of Burundi remain the key\r\nelement, and no solution to the crisis can possibly be found\r\nwithout our people, even one that might come from the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIt is with that concern in mind that for more than a\r\nyear the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a\r\npeace process based on an extensive consultation of our\r\npeople through domestic debate and on the peace\r\nconferences held abroad, so that all the people of Burundi,\r\nwithout exception, could be involved in inclusive political\r\nnegotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in\r\nBurundi.\r\nWe hail the efforts that have been made by a number\r\nof special envoys and representatives of the international\r\ncommunity alongside the designated mediator, but we also\r\nhope that the obstacles pointed out by the Head of the\r\ndelegation of Burundi in his statement of 2 October 1997,\r\nobstacles that stand in the way of such mediation, might be\r\ncleared away so as to increase the chances for success in\r\nthe second phase of the political negotiations, which are\r\nopen to all. The Government of Burundi is waiting to be\r\nconsulted by the facilitator as to the venue and date for the\r\nopening of those negotiations.\r\nMoreover, we are convinced that such obstacles could\r\nnot possibly be attributable to any friend of ours or to any\r\ncountry friendly to ours and working for peace in Burundi.\r\nBurundi’s current problems are the result of a\r\nconfluence of many different factors and external and\r\ninternal political and social events that would be very\r\ndifficult indeed to go into here and now before the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe total and illegal economic blockade that has\r\nbeen imposed on the people of Burundi for over a year\r\nnow is in no way contributing to the restoration of peace.\r\nOn the contrary, it is killing a people through hunger and\r\ndisease, as if the genocide and other massacres already\r\ninflicted on them had not been trial enough. We ask those\r\nresponsible for the blockade to lift it, for the people it hits\r\nhardest are the most vulnerable, many of them children,\r\nand they deserve everyone’s protection.\r\nTurning to the question of Burundi refugees, Burundi\r\nhas signed every accord of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, as well as the tripartite\r\nBurundi-Tanzanian-Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees accords on this issue. All\r\nmachinery must be brought into play to resolve this\r\nmatter within the aforementioned context.\r\nI shall not try the Assembly’s patience further, but\r\nin conclusion I should like to reaffirm the commitment of\r\nthe people and Government of Burundi to seeking a\r\npeaceful solution to the present crisis through political\r\nnegotiations open to all the parties concerned.\r\nOnly through dialogue can confidence, peace and\r\ndemocracy in our country be rebuilt.\r\nMr. Jabir (United Republic of Tanzania): We have\r\nheard the representative of Burundi. Since his statement\r\ncontained no new element, I wish only to reiterate what\r\nmy delegation said in the Assembly last Friday. The\r\nproblems of Burundi are not bilateral, with Tanzania or\r\nindeed with the region. The problems are in Burundi and\r\namong its people. The attempt to externalize the problems\r\nis unfortunate and must be rejected.\r\nMy country has stated that its only desire is to assist.\r\nIt has no political agenda in that country. It is up to the\r\nBurundi authorities to make it easier for Tanzania and,\r\nindeed, the international community, to help. We cannot\r\nhelp and do so efficiently unless the Burundi authorities\r\nface the reality of a negotiated settlement. There is no\r\nalternative to that.\r\nThe accusation of partiality or armed aggression or\r\ninsecurity of venue are all smoke screens to mask the\r\ndeep-seated reluctance of the Burundi military authorities\r\nto pursue a negotiated political settlement. This should be\r\nrejected.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 6 October 1997\r\nMy country remains committed to facilitating dialogue\r\nand peace in Burundi. A peaceful Burundi is a better\r\nneighbour with which to interact and trade. We look\r\nforward to the day when we will be spared the cyclical\r\ninflow of refugees, when the people of Burundi will not\r\nlive in perpetual fear and when the country will be stable\r\nand at peace.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5 p.m.\r\n17\r\n"
