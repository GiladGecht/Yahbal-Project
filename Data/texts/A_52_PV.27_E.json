(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work: letter\r\nfrom the Chairman of the Committee on Conferences\r\n(A/52/340/Add.1)\r\nThe President: This morning the Assembly will first\r\nturn its attention to document A/52/340/Add.1, which\r\ncontains a letter dated 6 October 1997 addressed to me by\r\nthe Chairman of the Committee on Conferences. As\r\nmembers are aware, the Assembly, in paragraph 7 of its\r\nresolution 40/243, decided that no subsidiary organ of the\r\nGeneral Assembly should be permitted to meet at United\r\nNations Headquarters during a regular session of the\r\nAssembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.\r\nAs indicated in the letter I have just mentioned, the\r\nCommittee on Conferences has recommended that the\r\nGeneral Assembly authorize the Committee on Information\r\nto meet in New York during the main part of the fifty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts the\r\nrecommendation of the Committee on Conferences?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The first speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Uzbekistan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdulaziz Kamilov.\r\nMr. Kamilov (Uzbekistan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to your high office, and to express our\r\nconfidence in the success of the work of the current\r\nsession. I also wish to thank sincerely Ambassador Razali\r\nIsmail for his enormous contribution to the work of the\r\nsessions of the General Assembly over which he presided.\r\nThe changes which have been taking place in our\r\nworld in recent years and the formation of a qualitatively\r\nnew geopolitical system of international relations require\r\nthe adaptation of the United Nations to new realities, with\r\nthe creation of a flexible and efficient international\r\nmechanism which can take effective measures to address\r\nthe new challenges of our time.\r\nIn Uzbekistan we have a positive assessment of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan’s plan for reforming the\r\nUnited Nations. Although a number of these proposals\r\nrequire careful study and additional elaboration, we can\r\nalready highlight concrete aspects which deserve support.\r\nI refer primarily to the decision on the enlargement of the\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council through\r\nthe inclusion of Germany and Japan, countries which\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\ntoday are playing a significant role in world economic and\r\npolitical affairs.\r\nWe also support the enlargement of the non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council, which, in our view,\r\nwould provide for a more democratic representation of\r\nother States in this body.\r\nTo promote efficiency in implementing the resolutions\r\nof the United Nations, there is a need to reinforce and\r\nbroaden the authority of the Secretary-General. In our view,\r\nwe should also support the proposal to establish the post of\r\na Deputy Secretary-General.\r\nThe idea of merging all the United Nations entities in\r\ndifferent countries under one flag in the so-called United\r\nNations Houses seems to us quite rational.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations administration\r\nstructure will allow for reallocation of the funds saved to\r\nenhance development programmes.\r\nThe creation of a single agency to combat crime,\r\nterrorism, drug-trafficking and money-laundering is also a\r\ntimely proposal.\r\nThe proposals on consolidating the economic and\r\nsocial departments, cutting down on United Nations\r\nadministrative staff, replacing the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs and establishing a streamlined\r\nEmergency Relief Coordination Office to coordinate\r\nactivities of all the United Nations agencies in\r\nimplementing assistance projects, also merit our attention.\r\nMaintaining security and stability in Central Asia and\r\nproviding conditions for the sustainable development of the\r\nStates of the region are among the crucial guidelines for the\r\nforeign policy of Uzbekistan. To achieve these goals,\r\nUzbekistan has put forward concrete initiatives, particularly\r\nwithin the rostrum of the United Nations.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to draw attention\r\nagain to a number of problems which require an immediate\r\nsolution, both at the regional level and at the broader\r\ninternational level.\r\nI refer first to the continuing conflict in Afghanistan,\r\nwhich has recently become particularly brutal, and to the\r\ncontinuing instability in Tajikistan.\r\nOur position of principle regarding the Afghan\r\nsettlement remains unchanged. Its major aspects include\r\nsuch points as the maintenance of the territorial integrity\r\nof Afghanistan; the rejection of force as a means of\r\nsettling the conflict; the cessation of external interference;\r\nthe imposition of an arms embargo; the participation in a\r\nphased peace process of all the major forces involved in\r\nthe conflict; the implementation of the peace process\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations, and with the\r\nparticipation of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC); and the creation of a broad-based\r\ncoalition Government including all the various opposition\r\nparties.\r\nWe share the view of the Secretary-General that if\r\nthe meaningless civil war in Afghanistan is to be halted,\r\nregional and international participants must shoulder\r\nadditional obligations. Despite all the complications of the\r\nsituation around Afghanistan, trends have recently been\r\nobserved which can, and indeed must, be used to begin\r\nthe peace process.\r\nThe proposal on imposing an arms embargo deserves\r\nspecial attention. Such an embargo, which has already\r\nbeen proposed by Uzbekistan on many occasions, must be\r\nconsidered the principal condition for halting external\r\ninterference in Afghanistan’s affairs. We are well aware\r\nof the technical difficulties related to the implementation\r\nof this initiative in the conditions prevailing in\r\nAfghanistan. However, we do not think that they are\r\ninsurmountable. In our view, the process of imposing an\r\narms embargo should be divided into two stages: first, the\r\nadoption by the Security Council of a resolution on the\r\nembargo, which would be political in nature; secondly,\r\nthe drawing up of United Nations control machinery for\r\ncompliance.\r\nWe welcome the stepping up of United Nations\r\nefforts to resolve the Afghan problem, in particular, the\r\nappointment of Mr. Brahimi as the Special Envoy of the\r\nSecretary-General. We hope that the United Nations will\r\nalso support our initiative for the creation of a contact\r\ngroup from among the countries neighbouring\r\nAfghanistan, as well as the United States, Russia and\r\nother interested States, together with, of course,\r\nrepresentatives of inter-Afghan forces.\r\nUzbekistan fully supports the principle of the\r\nindivisibility of security — internal, regional and global.\r\nOur country was among the first of the newly\r\nindependent States to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. At the forty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, in 1993, Uzbekistan\r\ncalled upon the international community to declare\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nCentral Asia a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and we have been\r\nconsistently moving towards the implementation of this\r\ninitiative.\r\nConcrete confirmation of this policy was the holding\r\nof the international conference “Central Asia — Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone” in Tashkent on 14 to 16 September,\r\nunder United Nations auspices and with the participation of\r\nhigh-level representatives of more than 60 international\r\norganizations and countries. This forum was a major\r\ninternational event in the history of the region. However,\r\nwe are well aware that the process of establishing a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia is not a one-time\r\npolitical action. It must be carried out within the framework\r\nof existing agreements and in accordance with international\r\nexperience, in particular within the framework of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nIn this regard, on the regional level a reliable system\r\nof collective efforts by States participating in this initiative\r\nshould be developed. Those efforts must ensure the non-\r\nproliferation regime, the ecological safety of hazardous\r\nindustries that involve nuclear raw materials and the\r\nprevention of leakage of nuclear technologies and materials.\r\nOn the international level it is necessary to give\r\npriority attention to the settlement of regional problems.\r\nThe phased advancement towards global security is possible\r\nonly after we create secure and stable regions. In other\r\nwords, when dealing with global problems, it is essential to\r\nfollow the principle of moving from regionalism to\r\nglobalism.\r\nIt is also necessary to fundamentally reconsider the\r\nsecurity guarantees provided to the non-nuclear States, first\r\nand foremost to those participating in nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzones. We need to organically combine the efforts for\r\npromoting non-proliferation and ensuring global nuclear\r\nsecurity with the resolution of regional problems. The\r\nproblem of non-proliferation must be considered in close\r\nlinkage with significant reductions of other types of\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nUzbekistan highly appreciates the efforts of\r\ninternational organizations — first of all the United\r\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) and the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) — for their support of the Central Asian\r\ninitiative. We would like to request the General Assembly,\r\nits President and the Secretary-General to assist in the\r\npassage of a special resolution in support of the initiative\r\ndeclaring Central Asia a nuclear-weapon-free zone and in\r\nthe establishment of a United Nations expert group to\r\nstudy the forms and elements of the regional agreement\r\non this issue.\r\nOur cooperation within the framework of the OSCE\r\nis making a significant contribution to enhancing regional\r\nsecurity in Central Asia. We consider the OSCE\r\nParliamentary Assembly Expanded Bureau Meeting\r\nSeminar, held in September 1997 in the capital of\r\nUzbekistan, as the world community’s recognition of\r\nCentral Asia’s importance in issues related to\r\nstrengthening peace and stability on the regional and\r\nglobal levels.\r\nThe creation of the Central Asian collective\r\npeacekeeping battalion by Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and\r\nUzbekistan was an important step towards safeguarding\r\npeace and stability in the region. For the first time on the\r\nterritory of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan broad-scale\r\nexercises of the Central Asian collective peacekeeping\r\nbattalion, Centrazbat 97, were held, with the participation\r\nof multinational forces. These exercises constituted a\r\nserious test, the successful completion of which confirmed\r\nthis battalion as a fully fledged unit in the United Nations\r\nreserve peacekeeping forces.\r\nOnce again we should like to take advantage of this\r\nUnited Nations forum to call upon the international\r\ncommunity to pool its efforts to tackle the serious threat\r\nto the security of the Central Asian region that may also\r\nhave consequences on the global level. I am referring to\r\nthe ecological situation in the Aral Sea basin.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly — the\r\nReform Assembly, as it was called by Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan — must give a fresh impetus to the joint\r\nefforts of the international community in combating\r\norganized crime, drug dealing and terrorism. We need to\r\ndevelop transnational programmes to confront these\r\nchallenges and threats.\r\nWe may confidently say that if favourable conditions\r\nand trends are maintained, in the twenty-first century\r\nCentral Asia, given its geostrategic significance and its\r\nvast natural, energy and human resources, will become a\r\npromising and dynamic regional market of a global\r\nimportance.\r\nThe interdependence of the situation emerging in\r\nCentral Asia, the common European security system\r\ntaking shape and the outlook for developing situations\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nwithin the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent\r\nneed for the international community to take measures to\r\nensure durable peace and stability in this region along with\r\nits sustainable development.\r\nMr. Koba (Central African Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): First and foremost, Sir, I would like to echo\r\nthe eminent speakers who have already addressed you from\r\nthis rostrum in conveying the warm congratulations of the\r\nCentral African delegation on your resounding election to\r\nthe presidency of this, the fifty-second session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The fact that you, Sir, have been chosen\r\nbears witness to the fact that your country, Ukraine,\r\ncontinues to play an important role on the world stage.\r\nYour wealth of experience and your abilities as an\r\nexperienced diplomat augur well indeed for the success of\r\nour work, and I can also assure you that you can count on\r\nour support and our availability to assist you.\r\nI would also like to express our fullest satisfaction\r\nwith the work of your predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for\r\nthe talent and skill with which he so wonderfully\r\ndischarged his duties. And we assure His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General, whose election was\r\nonly a just reward for his many years of service to the\r\nUnited Nations, of the renewed support of the people and\r\nGovernment of the Central African Republic.\r\nThis session is being held at a delicate time in the\r\nhistory of our Organization, because it is faced with many\r\ndifferent political, economic, social, cultural, legal and\r\ninstitutional problems which call for the appropriate\r\nreforms.\r\nTo renew the United Nations, to turn it into a\r\ndynamic, democratic and effective organization, is a major\r\nchallenge for this session, which the Secretary-General\r\nquite rightly described as the Reform Assembly. His\r\nbrilliant report presented on 16 July 1997 is perfectly in\r\ntune with the Member States’ expectations, because it not\r\nonly highlights the challenges facing us on the threshold of\r\nthe first century of a new millennium, but it also, and\r\nabove all, puts forward proposals for the longer term.\r\nThe United Nations has a very important role to play\r\nin the areas of safeguarding and maintaining international\r\npeace and security and promoting social and economic\r\ndevelopment, democracy, human rights and justice. The\r\nOrganization must be reformed and strengthening so as to\r\nbetter confront the new realities of today’s world. The\r\nCentral African Republic will make its own modest\r\ncontribution to this very important endeavour in close\r\ncollaboration with the member States of the Organization\r\nof African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nAs regards reforming the Security Council, the\r\nCentral African Republic hopes that the Council will be\r\nexpanded so as to provide equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation.\r\nBut what about the ever-widening gap between three\r\nquarters of humankind and the remainder? What about the\r\nproliferation of armed conflicts against a backdrop of\r\nintolerance, ethnic tension and deadly political\r\nconfrontations that jeopardize international peace and\r\nsecurity? Our Organization does not seem to be able to\r\ncome to grips with these problems.\r\nAnd yet, a few years ago, after a series of major\r\nevents radically transformed the old post-war order, we\r\nbelieved that the world was at last poised to move into a\r\nnew era because of the ensuing clear-cut improvement in\r\nthe international political climate and the new possibilities\r\nfor cooperation that emerged. These were supposed to\r\nbuild confidence among nations and facilitate the quest\r\nfor compromise on most of the questions of concern to\r\nthe international community.\r\nRegrettably, we were overly optimistic. In reflecting\r\non the sad realities of the day, I have in mind particularly\r\nthe many human lives lost in vain in Algeria and the\r\nthousands of women and children forcibly torn from their\r\nhomes and who, in the neighbouring Republic of the\r\nCongo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Somalia and elsewhere,\r\nare still paying a heavy price for our imperfections, our\r\ncontradictions and our intolerance.\r\nI believe that it is time to call upon the international\r\ncommunity and our Organization — which in this\r\nalarmingly serious case seems not to be fulfilling its\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security — to tackle resolutely the internal\r\nconflicts that are unfolding within our own States. We\r\nmust address these new conflicts, which entail serious\r\nviolations of fundamental human rights and which we are\r\nill-prepared to prevent and manage, because what is at\r\nstake is the very existence of our States, along with the\r\nbalance and cohesiveness of the international community.\r\nThe Central African Republic had cause to welcome\r\nthe convening on 25 September last of the ministerial-\r\nlevel meeting of the member States of the Security\r\nCouncil devoted to the situation in Africa. The\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nrecommendations emanating from those deliberations should\r\nbe translated into reality.\r\nThe delegation of the Central African Republic\r\nnonetheless welcomes the fact that significant progress\r\ntowards peace has been achieved in Angola, Liberia and\r\nHaiti. But we continue to believe that a great deal of work\r\nremains to be done by the parties concerned to overcome\r\nthe obstacles standing in the way of reconciliation and the\r\nrestoration of peace in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and\r\nin Cyprus.\r\nUnlike in other regions of the world, where renewed\r\neconomic growth is henceforth irreversible, Africa’s lack of\r\ngood performance and its economic and social situation\r\nremain a cause for concern in this era of globalization.\r\nHowever, we are not underestimating the scope and the\r\ncomplexity of the crucial problems facing the international\r\ncommunity at century’s end. To resolve these problems, a\r\nnew type of cooperation is urgently needed so as not to\r\nexclude three quarters of humankind from the march\r\ntowards progress and the common weal.\r\nAfrica continues to experience immense economic\r\ndifficulties because of its lack of control over certain\r\nexternal factors affecting its development, such as the\r\ncollapse in the prices fetched by its commodities, its debt\r\nburden and the inadequacy of its capital flows, which have\r\nprevented it from achieving sustained economic growth and\r\nraising the living standards of its peoples.\r\nWorse yet is the case of the least developed countries,\r\nmost of which are located on the African continent and\r\nwhose situation remains abysmal notwithstanding the timid\r\nsteps forward taken here and there. Though globalization\r\nhas given rise to a new social contract, the principle of\r\npartnership and of shared responsibility between the least\r\ndeveloped countries and the international community, with\r\nthe goal of reversing socio-economic decline and speeding\r\nup the process of sustained growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, should guide both sides in their commitment.\r\nNow the question is how to become competitive without the\r\nsupport of official development assistance, which is\r\ncontinuing to decline.\r\nAs we see it, this alarming situation calls for a\r\npragmatic approach to cooperation between Africa and its\r\npartners, in particular the international financial and\r\nmonetary institutions, which should not lose sight of these\r\nfactors in determining modalities for cooperating with the\r\ncontinent and providing it access to global resources. We\r\ncannot overemphasize the urgent need for a greater sense\r\nof responsibility and for a far stronger commitment on the\r\npart of the entire international community vis-à-vis this\r\ncontinent, which is foundering economically and socially.\r\nIt is this new awareness that will help Africa emerge at\r\nlast from the chaos and anarchy that continue to engulf it.\r\nWithout economic and social progress, there can be\r\nno talk of peace nor of democracy, because peace,\r\ndemocracy and development go hand in hand. This is\r\nespecially true in the case of the Central African\r\nRepublic, long known, owing to its long-standing\r\ncommitment to peace, as the Switzerland of Africa. Its\r\nPresident, Ange-Félix Patassé, rose to the highest office\r\nin the land through free and transparent elections and\r\ndaily preached peace and dialogue in the Central African\r\nsubregion. Nonetheless, the world was recently witness to\r\nthe sad spectacle of the Central African Republic’s being\r\nassailed by what have come to be known as the serial\r\nmutinies of Bangui, simply because of its inability to\r\nconsolidate its still fledgling democratic experience\r\nthrough sustained economic and social development.\r\nThe case of the Central African Republic casts light\r\non the root causes of the wave of violence that is\r\nsweeping our subregion. The mutinies — which,\r\ntragically, lasted a full year and have thrown the entire\r\ncountry into near-civil war — occurred against the\r\nbackdrop of a tribally motivated attempt at regaining\r\npower and as the result of manipulation by outside forces\r\nseeking to put an end to our democratic process. But none\r\nof this would have been possible had it not been for the\r\nvery difficult economic and social situation of our\r\ncountry. The joint impact of a terrible legacy, the free-fall\r\ndevaluation of the CFA franc and the chronically meagre\r\nrevenues coming into the public treasury had for all\r\npractical purposes created a situation in which the State\r\ncould no longer regularly pay its civil servants.\r\nThe upshot of this crisis was all but catastrophic\r\nbecause the damage done by the tragic events of April,\r\nMay and November 1996 gravely undermined our\r\ncountry’s potential for economic and social development.\r\nThe technical committee set up to take stock of the\r\ndamage concluded that for the first two cases of mutiny\r\nalone, it would cost some 41.9 billion CFA francs to\r\nmake up for the losses experienced by the State,\r\nbusinesses, projects and individuals — not to mention the\r\ncost of the measures needed to help the many victims of\r\nthat conflict.\r\nBeyond the necessary mobilization of all our\r\ncompatriots — to whom His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nPatassé, President of the Republic, has issued a powerful\r\ncall for the restoration of peace and national unity as a\r\nfoundation for the genuine economic recovery of our\r\ncountry — it is only appropriate for our partners and the\r\nentire international community to stand with us and not\r\nagainst us. For it is the intention of the Central African\r\nRepublic to continue and consolidate the democratic process\r\nto which it is resolutely committed.\r\nAnd beyond the praiseworthy support of the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), my landlocked country must be given the\r\nwherewithal to continue to be — as we already are out of\r\na sense of moral duty — a land of welcome and hospitality\r\nfor Sudanese, Rwandan, Burundian, Congolese and other\r\nbrothers and sisters who are paying a heavy price for our\r\nworld’s intolerance, ethnic tensions and deadly political\r\nwrangling.\r\nThe fact is that it is in adversity that one knows one’s\r\ntrue friends. Our own adversity has enabled the people of\r\nthe Central African Republic to gauge the sympathy and\r\nsolidarity they have enjoyed during the most trying times of\r\ntheir history. On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix\r\nPatassé, President of the Republic and Head of State and of\r\nGovernment, and of the people of the Central African\r\nRepublic, I reiterate our thanks to the entire international\r\ncommunity, and most particularly to France, the Federal\r\nRepublic of Germany, the United States of America, Japan,\r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\r\nGabon, Chad, Senegal, Togo, Mali, Burkina Faso, the\r\nUnited Nations, the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nEuropean Union, for the support and invaluable assistance\r\nthey are graciously according us.\r\nI take this opportunity also to convey particular thanks\r\nto all the States members of the Security Council, which on\r\n6 August last unanimously adopted resolution 1125 (1997)\r\non the Central African Republic. The immediate effect of\r\nthat decision was to deter open attempts at destabilization,\r\nand to enable — as it continues to do — the Inter-African\r\nMission to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui\r\nAgreements (MISAB) better to ensure peace and security\r\nin the capital and the provinces of the Central African\r\nRepublic.\r\nThe peace is still fragile and precarious, and on behalf\r\nof the entire people of the Central African Republic we\r\nurgently appeal to the United Nations to enable the mandate\r\nof MISAB to be extended until the Central African\r\nRepublic possesses a loyal national army that can guarantee\r\nthe survival of our republican institutions.\r\nI wish the Assembly full success in its work on the\r\nbasis of the principle of universality which is so dear to\r\nour Organization.\r\nThe President: I call next on His Excellency\r\nMr. Jérémie Bonnelame, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSeychelles.\r\nMr. Bonnelame (Seychelles) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir,\r\non your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-second session.\r\nI wish also to thank your predecessor, Ambassador\r\nRazali of Malaysia, for the skill and commitment with\r\nwhich he guided our work during the last session.\r\nI convey to the Secretary-General and his staff my\r\nhigh appreciation of the often difficult initiatives they\r\nhave taken this year to promote peace not only between\r\npeoples but also within nations. These initiatives accent\r\nthe Organization’s role and its principles, to which I am\r\npleased to reaffirm the commitment of the people of\r\nSeychelles. There have also been initiatives to promote\r\ndevelopment and to protect the environment and the weak\r\namong us, and to help stateless individuals and refugees\r\nfrom countries that are often marginalized.\r\nWe need a consistent, effective United Nations\r\nbacked by the funds necessary for it to carry out its\r\nmandate. The Secretary-General has proposed a series of\r\nreforms along these lines, and the Republic of Seychelles\r\nfirmly backs that initiative.\r\nSeychelles is a small island State. Yet we have done\r\nall in our power to integrate ourselves fully into\r\ninternational life and into the world economy. In that\r\nconnection, Seychelles has requested membership of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization; it is already a member of the\r\nIndian Ocean Commission and the Common Market for\r\nEastern and Southern Africa, and recently joined the\r\nSouthern African Development Community. Seychelles\r\nhas thus adopted an open economic policy designed to be\r\nattractive; yet we continue to face the handicaps\r\ncharacteristic of an island State, exacerbated by a lack of\r\nhuman and natural resources and by the limits of our\r\ndomestic markets.\r\nFollowing the Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held in\r\nBarbados in 1994, and in accordance with resolutions\r\nadopted in international forums, the international\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\ncommunity is heeding the appeal of small island States for\r\nhelp in laying and strengthening the foundations of\r\nsustainable development. Like larger countries, small island\r\nStates have the same aspirations, the same needs — and\r\neven more so. Yet they are disadvantaged by their greatly\r\nlimited means and their structurally fragile economies. That\r\nis why it would be more equitable to identify specific\r\ncriteria that would integrate them harmoniously into the\r\nprocess of global cooperation and economic development\r\non both the bilateral and the multilateral levels.\r\nRecently, Seychelles has experienced remarkable\r\nclimatic setbacks. Unceasing torrential rains of unusual\r\nintensity have caused loss of life, flooding, landslides and\r\nthe destruction of homes and of infrastructure of all kinds.\r\nThey also threaten the environment on which our lifestyle\r\ndepends and our ecosystem, especially in coastal areas.\r\nFor a small State striving to keep pace with\r\ndevelopment, an unexpected upheaval, with all its economic\r\nand other consequences, can have far-reaching effects that\r\nare not immediately evident.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs for having quickly\r\ndispatched an evaluation mission to take stock not only of\r\nthe damage done but of the future threats such an upheaval\r\nposes, given the climatic change under way on a global\r\nlevel. Moreover, that mission was followed by the\r\nlaunching of an appeal to the international community for\r\nassistance. The people of the Seychelles are very grateful\r\nfor all these actions.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the hope that\r\nthe future of our planet will bring vast improvements,\r\nnotwithstanding the numerous difficulties that loom on the\r\nhorizon. The United Nations, through its initiatives and the\r\njoint efforts of all peoples, will most surely achieve that\r\ngoal.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister of State for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Equatorial Guinea, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Don Miguel Oyono Ndong Mifumu.\r\nMr. Oyono Ndong Mifumu (Equatorial Guinea)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): Mr. President, it is a pleasure\r\nfor me to join preceding speakers in congratulating you on\r\nthe high distinction bestowed upon you and your country\r\nthrough your election to preside over this regular session of\r\nthe General Assembly, to which we have all come imbued\r\nwith our shared aspirations for the future of mankind. Once\r\nagain, we come to this forum to convey the warmest\r\ngreetings of solidarity, peace and hope of the people and\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and, in\r\nparticular, to express my country’s views on the issues to\r\nbe debated at this session.\r\nWe are three years away from a new millennium.\r\nThis waiting period is an opportunity to think deeply\r\nabout the challenges it has in store for us. We have\r\nmoved in a very short time from a bipolar world, marked\r\nby the cold war and both strategic and ideological\r\nconfrontations, to the new dynamics of globalization and\r\nthe interdependence of States in their relations within the\r\ninternational system.\r\nIndeed, when we consider that the millennium is\r\nabout to end and that our Organization has now been in\r\nexistence for more than 50 years, we must admit that a\r\ngreat deal has been achieved in terms of progress for\r\nmankind, particularly in the spheres of economic,\r\nscientific and technological development. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, there are still grey areas of uncertainty as\r\nregards the future of mankind and the possibilities of\r\nestablishing peace and security throughout the world.\r\nIn third world countries such as ours, for example,\r\nthe lives of millions of people have been affected by a\r\nhalt to progress and development as a result of extreme\r\npoverty, wars and armed conflicts and of the resurgence\r\nof mercenary activities and organized crime. In brief, the\r\npeople are subjected to wanton violence, and as a result\r\nsocial, political and economic systems are breaking down.\r\nWe believe that the burden placed on our peoples is\r\ntoo great and that their problems require a lasting and\r\nstable response from the United Nations, to include the\r\nelimination of neo-interventionist practices; the prevention\r\nof conflicts; the reduction of poverty; the elimination of\r\nneo-protectionist barriers in world trade; and help in the\r\nfight against terrorism, fundamentalism and anachronistic\r\nnationalism. The preservation of the environment and the\r\nfight against drug-trafficking and the consumption of\r\nillicit drugs must also be prime objectives of our\r\ncollective action. These problems are not restricted to the\r\nterritory of a single State, and therefore their solution\r\ndemands the involvement and solidarity of all nations the\r\nworld over, in a context of consensus and more\r\ncoordinated international cooperation.\r\nThis, in turn, creates the need to ensure democratic\r\nreform of institutions and organizations of a global scope.\r\nThe division of the world into categories must become a\r\nthing of the past, although we agree that some among us\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nmust shoulder special responsibilities vis-à-vis mankind\r\nsince they, in a sense, are the ones responsible for certain\r\nthreats that face us: the nuclear threat, the large-scale\r\nproduction and sale of armaments, the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment and the exercise of absolute power over the\r\neconomy, finance and advances in science, technology and\r\ninformation. For if a third world exists today, it is only\r\nbecause someone exploited it to create a first world. We do\r\nnot intend to wait for the emergence of a fourth world\r\nwhose means and resources we can exploit to become\r\ndeveloped. The point is to make sure that the resources\r\namassed by the first world, the countries of the North, are\r\ntoday made available to the developing countries. For that\r\nto happen, the international trading system must be fair,\r\npoverty must be reduced, the social development and\r\nscientific and technological advance of developing countries\r\nmust be fostered and the debt problem must be alleviated.\r\nIn short, the differences in the quality of life that separate\r\nthe citizens of the North from those of the South must be\r\ndrastically reduced, in a spirit of open solidarity that will\r\nwork for the progress and development of all countries.\r\nAll these aspects are the real issues to be discussed as\r\nwe strive to attain lasting world peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the coming millennium. The United Nations\r\nmust therefore become a much more global and democratic\r\nworld Organization so that it can take a dynamic approach\r\nto the problems weighing on mankind. It must be\r\nmodernized, brought up to date and in tune with the new\r\ntimes, able to express the common will of all nations.\r\nTherefore, it must be restructured.\r\nIn this connection, Equatorial Guinea feels, as do\r\nmany others, that it is time to reform the decision-making\r\nbody of the United Nations, the Security Council. With\r\nregard to reform, we do not know whether it is the number\r\nof the Council’s members that has prevented the United\r\nNations from functioning with greater flexibility and\r\nefficiency. Nor are we sure that an increase in the number\r\nof permanent members will make for a more representative\r\nUnited Nations. What we must attempt to gain is more\r\nvoices expressing the will of the peoples to see a more\r\nprosperous, peaceful and lastingly stable world. If this\r\ncannot be achieved by returning to the General Assembly\r\nits legitimate rights, it would be reasonable to have more\r\nmembers of the Security Council representing the regions\r\nand to ensure that the rules governing the use of the veto\r\ntake into account the interest of the majority.\r\nEquatorial Guinea is interested in ensuring that we\r\nhave a properly functioning mechanism for agreement that\r\nreflects, above all, the spirit of equity and justice within the\r\nUnited Nations. For Equatorial Guinea, which is a small\r\ncountry in terms of both area and population, the\r\ndemocratic functioning of the United Nations provides a\r\nguarantee of security and stability in international\r\nrelations and, above all, ensures scrupulous respect for\r\nevery nation’s right of sovereignty.\r\nIt is no idle claim that countries like ours do not\r\nreceive appropriate treatment in relations between States.\r\nThis applies, for example, to the vague demands relating\r\nto the universal principle of respect for fundamental\r\nhuman rights, which include political, economic and\r\nsocial rights.\r\nIn the specific case of Equatorial Guinea, it is\r\nneither understandable nor acceptable that, despite our\r\ngreat efforts to achieve a participatory democracy and\r\nrespect for human rights, international public opinion is\r\nstill being manipulated by some in order to project a false\r\nimage of our country to the outside world for reasons that\r\nare inconsistent with this universal principle. We do not\r\nbelieve that anyone has a monopoly on values and virtues\r\nin this respect.\r\nHowever, some years ago my country reached the\r\nconclusion that respect for human rights comes from a\r\ncontinuous process and not from an immediate response\r\nto criteria and demands imposed by groups or individuals\r\nwith partisan political interests. It is in this context that\r\nthe Government of Equatorial Guinea, of its own free\r\nwill, is participating in and cooperating with all the\r\ninitiatives of the United Nations and certain friendly\r\ncountries to consolidate respect for human rights in the\r\ncountry. To that end, working with the United Nations\r\nCommission on Human Rights and the United Nations\r\nCentre for Human Rights, we have already organized\r\nvarious training, educational and information programmes\r\nrelating to human rights.\r\nMy country is also proud to be one of the few\r\ncountries in the world that, of its own free will, has\r\nagreed with another country — in our case, the United\r\nStates of America — a technical and financial assistance\r\nprogramme for measures aimed at the better exercise\r\nwithin our society of all human rights. In the context of\r\nthis programme, far-reaching legal reforms have been set\r\nout to regulate this exercise of rights, as well as to\r\nachieve better administration and governance by the State.\r\nAll these measures will be free from political interference\r\nbased on ideological or partisan interests.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nFrom this rostrum, therefore, I should like to confirm\r\nto international public opinion that in Equatorial Guinea\r\nhuman rights form an integral part of the priorities of the\r\nGovernment and of all the political forces of the nation and\r\nthat we are critiquing and continuously assessing our\r\nprogress. We do not, therefore, need either the approval or\r\nthe guidance of any other society or institution in order to\r\nevaluate this tangible reality. Nor do we need any\r\nfavourable or unfavourable propaganda from international\r\nmedia that may be linked to interests and pressure groups\r\nwith hidden agendas.\r\nWe certainly agree that the same degree of pressure\r\nthat is brought to bear with regard to the political rights of\r\npeoples must also be brought to bear in order to bring\r\nabout more concrete support for the right of peoples to\r\ndevelopment and the progress of nations. It is our\r\nunanimous desire that in the third millennium the millions\r\nof men, women and children of the world will have the\r\nright to health services, education, decent housing, drinking\r\nwater, electricity, food and clothing. But this objective\r\ncannot be achieved through restrictive measures and\r\npolicies or through discriminatory economic blockades. We\r\nalso wish to note that even these policies are not applied\r\nequitably throughout the international community.\r\nNevertheless, thanks to our strong conviction that we\r\nmust play the principal role in our own development, today\r\nmore than ever Equatorial Guinea is being targeted by\r\ncertain forces and is becoming a strategically and\r\neconomically significant zone in the subregion of central\r\nAfrica. At the economic level, our country has just attained\r\nthe status of oil-producing country, and attempts are being\r\nmade to destabilize it for purposes of hegemony and for\r\nstrategic reasons. Exactly five months ago, thanks to the\r\nspirit of African solidarity demonstrated by our sister\r\nrepublic of Angola, my country was saved from an\r\nattempted invasion by mercenaries, which was organized\r\nand financed by certain foreign political groups with murky\r\nand undisclosed designs on our nation.\r\nInstability in the subregion of central Africa is today\r\nthreatening the security of the region and the continent.\r\nPlans, strategies and machinery for destabilization are being\r\nfashioned from outside the region that are capable of\r\ndestroying the present incipient democratic regimes in the\r\nregion. Powerful communications media are actively\r\ninvolved in systematically distorting, disinformation and the\r\nmisrepresentation of everything that is happening in the\r\nregion. The situation in Angola, the Republic of the Congo,\r\nRwanda and Burundi, as well as the recent conflicts in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, have been presented\r\nto international public opinion as Dantesque and apocalyptic.\r\nWe ask the United Nations to follow up on\r\neverything that is taking place in this region, particularly\r\nin the area of the Gulf of Guinea, from the Niger river\r\ndelta to the enclave of Cabinda, as well as in the Great\r\nLakes region.\r\nIn the specific case of the Republic of the Congo, a\r\nsister country with which we share common interests, the\r\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea fully supports the\r\ninternational mediation efforts of the President of the\r\nRepublic of Gabon, Mr. El Hadj Omar Bongo and of the\r\nspecial representative of the United Nations and of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nWe have the feeling that a new cold war is being\r\nwaged in Africa based on cultural and linguistic\r\ninfluences. The fact that English, French, Portuguese and\r\nSpanish languages are spoken should only serve to enrich\r\nour values and capacities in terms of international\r\ncooperation and should be not a factor for confrontation\r\nand antagonism based on hegemony. This phenomenon\r\nhas a serious adverse effect on our ability to achieve unity\r\nat the continental level in Africa for the peaceful\r\nresolution of conflicts. We therefore appeal to the United\r\nNations and the OAU to initiate consensus-based actions\r\nthat will lead to the reduction of such differences.\r\nIn this context, my Government is making efforts to\r\nmaintain an internal and regional balance by developing\r\na policy based on dialogue, consensus and good-\r\nneighbourliness, which are indispensable tools for\r\nensuring peace and security in the continent.\r\nIn this process of political and economic change\r\nthere have been setbacks and difficulties, but we have\r\nkept determinedly to the upward path that will enable us\r\nto leave behind a past that produced severe economic\r\nregressiveness and a breakdown of democratic principles\r\nand values. We want Equatorial Guinea to be included\r\nfully within the dynamics of change and globalization.\r\nWe want to ensure that we are incorporated into the\r\nregenerative trend of free market economy with a strong\r\nsocial component and dialogue based on patriotism,\r\nflexibility and tolerance among all the political forces and\r\nthroughout civil society in our country.\r\nIndeed, we have just held, from 8 to 13 September\r\n1997, a national economic conference designed essentially\r\nto bring about a national dialogue to achieve a definition\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nof a consensus-based strategy involving all political forces,\r\ncivil society, non-governmental organizations and religious\r\nassociations, with the participation of international agencies\r\nof the United Nations system, the World Bank, the\r\nEuropean Union and African regional and subregional\r\norganizations, as well as friendly nations, aimed at\r\nimplementing structural reforms in the economy and\r\nsustainable development of the country, through the rational\r\nand transparent use of oil, forest and fishing resources.\r\nIn the political field, we will proceed with the free and\r\ntransparent reform of laws regulating the exercise of\r\ndemocratic liberties to achieve better governance for our\r\nnation. We have the firm political determination to attain\r\nthese objectives and to meet our commitments, and we\r\nappeal for international solidarity.\r\nI cannot conclude without expressing, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea, our warmest\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\non his wise and sound suggestions for reforming the bodies\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nEquatorial Guinea will continue to support those\r\nefforts, aimed at achieving more dynamic and flexible\r\nmechanisms and structures for peacekeeping and the\r\npromotion of balanced and sustainable social and economic\r\ndevelopment in the world.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Kyrgyzstan, His Excellency Mr. Muratbek\r\nImanaliev.\r\nMr. Imanaliev (Kyrgyzstan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me, on behalf of the Government of the\r\nKyrgyz Republic and its people, to congratulate my\r\ncolleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine,\r\nMr. Udovenko, on his election to the high office of\r\nPresident of the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly, and to wish him success in his endeavours. May\r\nI also express our feelings of respect for his country, which\r\nis playing an important role in resolving regional and global\r\nissues.\r\nI would also like to express our heartfelt gratitude to\r\nthe previous President of the General Assembly, the\r\nrepresentative of the friendly Malaysian people,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for his active and dynamic\r\nefforts in establishing constructive dialogue on ways to\r\nreform the United Nations.\r\nLike the entire international community, Kyrgyzstan\r\nexpects genuine progress regarding the complex issue of\r\nthe reform of the United Nations to come out of the\r\npresent session. We are confident that the session will be\r\nable to cope with the problems facing the Organization\r\ntoday during this difficult and complicated period. The\r\nPresident and the Government of my country fully\r\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations,\r\nand his ability to respond sensitively and adequately to\r\nthe challenges of a rapidly changing world. We are\r\nconfident that a renewed United Nations will truly\r\nembody the principles and purposes proclaimed in its\r\nCharter, ensuring the harmony of the interests of all its\r\nMembers in the name of peace and progress. We are\r\nready to support all proposals that promote that goal.\r\nRegarding the reform of the Security Council, the\r\nissue of improving its methods of work is no less\r\nimportant than the question of enlarging its membership.\r\nKyrgyzstan believes that these questions must be\r\nconsidered together. We continue to support the proposal\r\nfor permanent membership in the Council for Japan and\r\nGermany. However, in our view, the permanent members\r\nof the Security Council should also include one\r\nrepresentative each from Africa, Asia and Latin America.\r\nMankind is now on the eve of a new millennium,\r\nand the changes taking place are altering the image of\r\nmankind and shifting the emphasis in the models for\r\nunderstanding and explaining our world. The collapse of\r\na bipolar world has provided us an opportunity to focus\r\nefforts on resolving the issues of poverty, health care,\r\neducation, economic development and democracy. We are\r\nall, however, still facing the threat of local and regional\r\nconflicts, international terrorism, organized crime, illegal\r\ntrafficking in drugs and weapons, the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and the deterioration of the\r\nstate of the environment. All these negative aspects of\r\nhuman activity threaten the global trend towards\r\nstrengthening peace and progress, undermine the fragile\r\nnew democracies, wear down the strength of the\r\ndeveloping countries and generally threaten all our efforts\r\nfocused on building a safer and better world.\r\nThe period after the achievement of independence\r\nwas decisive for Kyrgyzstan, in the context of the\r\nformation of national statehood and of new social and\r\neconomic ties. The country is actively seeking ways and\r\nmeans to harmoniously integrate itself into the\r\ninternational community. Clear successes have already\r\nbeen achieved on this thorny path in strengthening\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\ndemocratic institutions, radical reform of the economy of\r\nthe country, improving the means for achieving inter-ethnic\r\nagreement, enhancing tolerance and ensuring human rights.\r\nThe leadership of the country is also concentrating on\r\nthose domestic and international issues which must be\r\ndeveloped on a permanent and positive basis for the well-\r\nbeing of the population of Kyrgyzstan.\r\nOur country was the first of the newly independent\r\nStates to draw up and adopt a national plan of action for\r\nenvironmental protection. In the light of the implementation\r\nof the decisions of the Rio Conference, Kyrgyzstan is now\r\ncarrying out a country project, Capacity 21, which consists\r\nof three major components: coordination of and carrying\r\nout ecological studies, stable management of water\r\nresources and economic growth and social development.\r\nThrough an edict of President Akayev, a national strategy\r\nhas been adopted for sustainable human development which\r\nrecognizes man, and his harmonious existence with nature,\r\nas the highest priority. Kyrgyzstan was the first country in\r\nthe region to draw up a “concept for ecological security”.\r\nThe Declaration adopted by the conference in Rio\r\nranks mountainous ecological systems among those\r\nparticularly vulnerable to natural and man-made impacts. It\r\nis universally recognized that peoples living in mountainous\r\nregions bear far heavier social and economic burdens than\r\nthose who live in plains.\r\nIn the light of these factors and circumstances and also\r\non the basis of the decisions of the Global Environment\r\nFacility, our country held an international conference on\r\nproblems of mountain ecosystems. The participants in the\r\nconference put forward a proposal to proclaim an\r\ninternational year of the mountains, a proposal which was\r\nactively supported by President Akayev in his message to\r\nthe delegates to the mountain forum and in his letter to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nAt the regular session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in July this year, in Geneva, a resolution\r\nproclaiming International Year of Mountains, sponsored by\r\n44 countries, was adopted by consensus. The resolution\r\ncontains a request to the Secretary-General to present to the\r\nregular session of the Economic and Social Council in\r\n1998, after consultations with Governments and with the\r\nrelevant international, regional and non-governmental\r\norganizations, a report on the desirability of proclaiming the\r\nInternational Year of Mountains and other measures to\r\nensure the sustainable development of mountainous\r\ncountries.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to appeal to\r\nGovernments and, above all, to the other sponsors to\r\nsubmit the relevant information for incorporation into a\r\ncomplete and comprehensive report on this question by\r\nthe Secretary-General. I hope the General Assembly will\r\nin turn adopt a consensus decision on this initiative.\r\nAt the same time, we believe that it is possible, with\r\nsupport from Governments, to raise the question of\r\ndrawing up a global programme of action to ensure the\r\nsustainable development of countries with mountainous\r\nregions, similar to the programme being carried out for\r\nsmall island developing countries.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the economic gap\r\nbetween the rich developed countries and the developing\r\nworld has widened over recent years. The poorest\r\ncountries are not in a position to take off economically or\r\nsocially and are continuing to lose the ties that enable\r\nthem to participate in the world economy. We can assume\r\nthat if this trend continues, their numbers will continue to\r\ngrow, and this represents a serious threat to all human\r\ndevelopment. We need to halt that trend. In this context,\r\nin the view of the experts, the most promising approaches\r\nare to increase investments in human resources to\r\nencourage the implementation of ecologically clean and\r\neffective technologies and to reform price structures.\r\nIn our view, it is precisely in these areas that United\r\nNations activities, in new conditions, should be stepped\r\nup in order to promote economic and social progress. We\r\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General to promote\r\nstable and sustainable development.\r\nSupporting peace and security is the highest priority\r\ntask of the United Nations. We place great store by the\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities and pay due\r\ntribute to the courage and selflessness of United Nations\r\npersonnel working in regions of conflict. The efforts of\r\nthe United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan,\r\nheaded by the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Gerd Merrem, and the Collective\r\nPeacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS), culminated successfully in\r\nMoscow on 27 June 1997 with the signing of the General\r\nAgreement on the Establishment of Peace and National\r\nAccord in Tajikistan, which opened the way for the\r\ncountry’s transition from war to reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation.\r\nAs a representative of one of the States that is a\r\nguarantor of peace in Tajikistan, I am gratified to note my\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\ncountry’s involvement in this event. The mediation efforts\r\nof Kyrgyzstan, and of President Akayev himself, helped\r\nbring about the important agreement in May this year that\r\nlaid the way for the General Agreement, namely, the\r\nsigning of the Protocol on Political Questions. However, as\r\nthe events in August demonstrated, peace in Tajikistan is\r\nstill extremely fragile and its survival depends, first and\r\nforemost, on the Tajik parties themselves and how faithful\r\nthey are to the commitments they have made. We are\r\nconvinced that our Tajik friends will be able to see this\r\nthrough.\r\nThe prospects for peace-building in Tajikistan depend\r\nto a significant extent on the situation along the Tajik-\r\nAfghan border. The armed conflict in Afghanistan is of the\r\ngreatest concern to the States of the Central Asian region;\r\nit fosters the illegal production and trafficking of drugs and\r\nis prompting the massive flow of refugees to neighbouring\r\ncountries. The President and Government of Kyrgyzstan are\r\nfirmly convinced that there can be only one solution to the\r\nAfghan conflict, namely, a political solution. The problem\r\ncan be solved with the political will of the Afghan parties\r\nabove all and assistance from neighbouring States that have\r\nan influence in the region.\r\nWe have not abandoned hope regarding the\r\norganization of direct inter-Afghan negotiations under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations to discuss conditions for a\r\nceasefire and subsequent measures to bring about national\r\nreconciliation. In November 1996, President Akayev put\r\nforward an initiative to hold these negotiations in Bishkek.\r\nSubsequently, this proposal was repeated at meetings in\r\nNew York of top officials and experts on Afghanistan.\r\nBuilding on this initiative, in August the President of\r\nKyrgyzstan appealed to the parties to the conflict and Heads\r\nof State and Government concerned.\r\nKyrgyzstan, which does not share a border with\r\nAfghanistan and has no interest aside from ensuring\r\nregional security, considers the organization of inter-Afghan\r\nnegotiations under United Nations auspices an integral part\r\nof its peaceful policy of good-neighbourly relations and\r\ncooperation. Kyrgyzstan is ready to play the impartial role\r\nof mediator and make its good offices available to ensure\r\na peaceful settlement of this problem.\r\nPursuant to its peaceful policy, Kyrgyzstan has been\r\nactively promoting in the United Nations since 1995 the\r\nidea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central\r\nAsia, as reflected in a number of working papers of the\r\n1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\r\nthe Preparatory Committee of the Conference of Parties\r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons to be held in the year 2000 and the\r\nDisarmament Commission. We are firmly convinced that\r\nthe creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones, which is an\r\nimportant confidence-building measure and a positive\r\nbackdrop to the disarmament process, is helping\r\nstrengthen peace and security in the region and, in the\r\nfinal analysis, throughout the world.\r\nWith the entry into force of the Treaties of Pelindaba\r\nand Bangkok, more than 1.7 billion people will be living\r\nin zones free of nuclear weapons. Together with\r\nAntarctica, this territory will cover practically the entire\r\nsouthern hemisphere. It is essential that we do all we can\r\nto support and promote the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones. Here, above all, we are hoping for the\r\nunderstanding and support of nuclear-weapon States. At\r\nthe international conference this September on the\r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, held in\r\nTashkent, Kyrgyzstan proposed the convening of an\r\nadvisory meeting of the five Central Asian States, the five\r\nnuclear-weapon States that are permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, and representatives of the United\r\nNations to discuss practical measures to make this idea a\r\nreality. The conference approved the proposal.\r\nKyrgyzstan is actively participating in peacekeeping\r\nactivities. The Collective Peacekeeping Forces of CIS in\r\nTajikistan includes one of our battalions. Kyrgyz military\r\npersonnel in the Central Asian peacekeeping battalion\r\ntook part in the joint exercises held within the framework\r\nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\r\nprogramme Partnership for Peace. Kyrgyzstan is also a\r\nmember of the United Nations Special Committee on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations. We are also interested in\r\ntraining an international peace force, military observers\r\nand civilian personnel so that they can participate in\r\npeacekeeping operations. I would like to take advantage\r\nof this opportunity to ask the United Nations and the\r\ndonor countries to give us as much assistance as possible\r\nin this area.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to say that this is a\r\ndecisive session for the United Nations. I should like to\r\nexpress the hope that the interests of individual countries\r\nand regions can be reconciled and that they will not\r\nprevail over responsibility for the fate of our common\r\nOrganization. On this positive note, I should like to end\r\nmy statement.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, Her Excellency The\r\nHonourable Janet G. Bostwick.\r\nMrs. Bostwick (Bahamas): I join previous speakers in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\r\nof the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. My\r\ndelegation is satisfied that your vast experience in\r\ninternational affairs and your proven diplomatic skills will\r\nguide the work of this session to a successful conclusion.\r\nI wish to assure you of my delegation’s full support and\r\ncooperation in the execution of the duties of your office.\r\nI also wish to express my delegation’s gratitude and\r\ncongratulations to your predecessor, Ambassador Razali\r\nIsmail of Malaysia, who presided over our Assembly during\r\nthe fifty-first session with great vigour, skill and resolve.\r\nHaving had the honour of serving as a Vice-President of\r\nthat session, I am particularly appreciative of his\r\nnoteworthy contributions.\r\nThis is my first opportunity in this Assembly to\r\naddress and congratulate our new Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan. He is, of course, no stranger to any of us,\r\nhaving faithfully served this Organization for so many\r\nyears. We are confident that he has the vision, ability and\r\ndetermination to lead the United Nations as it prepares to\r\nmeet the challenges of the new millennium. I wish to assure\r\nthe Secretary-General of the continued support and\r\ncooperation of the Government of the Commonwealth of\r\nthe Bahamas.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of the\r\nBahamas, I also wish to pay tribute to our former\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The\r\nBahamas particularly wishes to recall and salute his tireless\r\nefforts in seeking to restore financial stability to our\r\nOrganization.\r\nToday, I reiterate the Bahamas’ solemn pledge that as\r\nwe lead our nation into a new millennium the primary\r\nfocus of our efforts will be directed towards improving the\r\ndelivery of health care, education and skills training, a\r\nreduction in the level of serious crime and unemployment,\r\nand the eradication of poverty and poor housing. We are\r\ncommitted to achieving the full empowerment of women\r\nand equality among the sexes as we work toward the\r\nevolution of a society in which our children will live with\r\nhope, a society where there is opportunity for all, where\r\nthere is respect for human rights, fundamental values and\r\nthe rule of law.\r\nMr. Altangerel (Mongolia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nOur efforts on behalf of the Bahamian people also\r\nrepresent our contribution towards the collective efforts\r\nwhich Member States of the United Nations must make\r\nto ensure a safe, stable and productive global society so\r\nthat progress, peace and development can be achieved for\r\nall the people represented here. We are therefore\r\ncommitted to assisting in the much needed reform of this\r\nworld body, so as to enable us to achieve these goals.\r\nOne of the greatest threats to quality of life and to\r\nproductive development worldwide is criminal behaviour.\r\nMy Government has set as one of its highest priorities the\r\ncomprehensive reduction and prevention of crime, in all\r\nits forms, including drug-trafficking, money-laundering\r\nand illegal trafficking in firearms, and, indeed, in human\r\nbeings. Those who engage in such menacing activities\r\nrespect no borders. We therefore implore all Member\r\nStates, irrespective of size or might, to recognize that the\r\nmost effective means of reducing crime at the national\r\nand international levels is through joint and collaborative\r\nefforts.\r\nThe Government of the Bahamas supports the\r\nstrengthening of the international legal order against\r\ncrime. We also hope that the special session on the\r\nquestion of drugs in 1998 will provide new impetus and\r\nresolve to combat this particular menace to all of our\r\nsocieties.\r\nMy Government reiterates its call to urgently address\r\nthe growing problem of the traffic in small arms. The\r\nBahamas, neither a manufacturer nor a vendor of arms,\r\nurges those countries involved in the production and sale\r\nof arms to impose stringent control measures and provide\r\nassistance to vulnerable States to reduce the threat of the\r\ntraffic in arms.\r\nAnother concern of the world’s nations is the\r\nprotection of the environment. The Bahamas recognizes\r\nand appreciates that conservation and enhancement of the\r\nenvironment are critically important to the well-being of\r\nour people, and especially that of future generations.\r\nConsequently, our national planning process incorporates\r\ncommunity environmental education and the regular\r\nmonitoring and enforcement of laws for the protection of\r\nnatural resources and the conservation of habitats. Indeed,\r\nduring the course of this year, the Government of the\r\nBahamas enacted legislation to protect our physical\r\nlandscape and prevent the destruction of certain\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nindigenous trees. The expansion of green and open spaces\r\nfor the benefit of the general population is another key\r\npillar in our environmental policy.\r\nTourism is the leading industry in the Bahamas and\r\nthe fastest growing industry in the world. We are all aware,\r\nhowever, that the development of tourism does not always\r\ntake place in harmony with environmental protection and\r\nconservation. Mindful of this fact, the Bahamas, along with\r\nits regional partners, seeks to develop strategies, policies\r\nand procedures which will ensure that the continued\r\ndevelopment of the industry is consistent with standards of\r\nenvironmental sustainability. In this vein, the Caribbean\r\nCommunity has adopted a regional position against the\r\ntransportation of hazardous and radioactive substances\r\nthrough the Caribbean Sea, a concern previously voiced in\r\nthis forum.\r\nWhile the concept of sustainable development remains\r\nsubject to further definition, my Government believes that\r\npoverty reduction and social development can and must be\r\nachieved in concert with environmental integrity, economic\r\nstability and good health. The proper integration of\r\ndeveloping economies into the rapidly advancing\r\nglobalization of world trade will, we believe, mark the\r\nmeasure of our success in these areas. Regrettably,\r\ndevelopments over the past decade have not always met\r\nexpectations.\r\nIn spite of the technological revolution of the last\r\ndecade and the rapid increase in worldwide commerce, the\r\nbenefits of the globalization of the world’s economy have\r\nnot been evenly distributed. Developing countries continue\r\nto be marginalized even as the world’s market economy\r\ngrows at an extraordinary pace.\r\nGlobalization can offer great opportunities, but only if\r\nit is managed carefully and with more concern for equity,\r\nmorality and indeed compassion. An enabling environment\r\nmust be created for all to take full advantage of the new\r\nopportunities created by globalization.\r\nThe peculiar vulnerability of small islands — their\r\nsusceptibility to natural disasters, their economy’s\r\ndependence on primary products, their small human and\r\nmaterial resource base — means that small island States\r\nhave much more at stake in achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The Bahamas, therefore, attaches great\r\nimportance to the 1999 review of the Barbados Programme\r\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, and calls for the mobilization of external\r\nresources for its further implementation. We are also\r\npleased to note that consideration is being given by the\r\nUnited Nations to the possible development of a\r\nvulnerability index. We welcome the proposed convening\r\nof an expert group meeting later this year to review\r\nvarious proposals, and look forward to the completion of\r\nthe technical study now in progress.\r\nThe development of a mechanism such as the\r\nvulnerability index will help to alleviate a concern which\r\nthe Bahamas has repeatedly expressed in this assembly\r\nregarding the persistent use of per capita gross national\r\nproduct as the major measurement of wealth. It is our\r\nview that this criterion is an inadequate measurement of\r\ndevelopment and is often inconsistent with the principles\r\nof equity.\r\nThe vulnerability of small island States is painfully\r\ndemonstrated in the unfolding natural disaster on the\r\nCaribbean island of Montserrat, where volcanic activity\r\nhas forever changed the physical, sociological and\r\npsychological landscape. Indeed, the viability of the island\r\nto provide a base for the livelihood and development of\r\nthe people of Montserrat is yet to be determined. We, the\r\nGovernment and people of the Bahamas, wish to express\r\nour solidarity with, and pledge our continued support to,\r\nthe people of Montserrat during this particularly difficult\r\ntime.\r\nWe are similarly conscious of the fact that natural\r\ndisasters affect virtually all the Member States of this\r\nOrganization, large and small, developed and developing.\r\nIn recent times, typhoons in South-East Asia, floods in\r\nEastern and Central Europe and in the central states and\r\nprovinces of the United States and Canada, and\r\nearthquakes in South America, and most recently in Italy\r\nand Indonesia, have wreaked untold suffering on millions\r\nof people.\r\nAs we look towards the twenty-first century, we\r\nmust assess how best this Organization can prepare itself\r\nduring the next three years to enter into this new era in\r\nhuman history.\r\nSince becoming a Member of the United Nations in\r\n1973, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has at\r\nsuccessive sessions of the Assembly reaffirmed the\r\nimportance of the United Nations and has conveyed its\r\ncommitment to work with other Member States in pursuit\r\nof the principles and objectives of the Charter.\r\nIn this connection, we congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the important reform proposals which he has\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\npresented, and we stand ready to participate in their\r\ncomprehensive and constructive review during this session.\r\nIt is the view of my delegation that reform should\r\nhave as its end result an improved and more efficient\r\nOrganization, fully able to meet the demands of the\r\nMembers which it serves. At the same time, reform would\r\nbe meaningless if the Organization were not to have a\r\nstable financial basis on which to carry out its functions. It\r\nis imperative, therefore, that we find a way to overcome the\r\nmyriad obstacles that have eluded resolution to date in areas\r\nsuch as the reform of the Security Council and the financial\r\nsituation of the United Nations.\r\nThe Bahamas strongly urges all Member States to\r\ncommit themselves to resolution of the question of Security\r\nCouncil reform at this fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly. The Bahamas supports the need to expand the\r\nCouncil’s membership in both categories. This expansion\r\nmust, however, pay due regard to the principles of equal\r\nrepresentation, the reflection of the universal character of\r\nthe Organization and the need to correct existing\r\nimbalances in the composition of the Council.\r\nIn a world confronted daily by press reports on the\r\ntragedies of failed efforts to preserve peace between\r\nnations — and indeed, between different ethnic and/or\r\nreligious groups within nations — it is frequently easy to\r\nignore the successes being achieved by the Organization.\r\nMy Government welcomes the positive work being done by\r\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The fact that increasing numbers of\r\ncountries are willing to cooperate with the United Nations\r\nis an indication of how important it is for the Organization\r\nto continue the implementation of its mandate in this area.\r\nWe note the success stories in areas such as Central\r\nAmerica and also in Haiti, where the mandate of the\r\nSupport Mission has recently been extended. It has always\r\nbeen the contention of the Bahamas Government that too\r\nearly a withdrawal from Haiti had the potential of derailing\r\nthe hard-earned gains made in that country. The continuing\r\nand recently escalating arrival of many Haitian migrants in\r\nthe Bahamas is a sobering reminder that a setback in\r\nHaiti’s difficult march towards political and economic\r\nstability could well be destabilizing.\r\nThe Government applauds the international community\r\nin its successful negotiation of a treaty to ban anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. Bahamas will sign the treaty and ratify it as\r\nsoon as possible, and hopes that the Convention will\r\nreceive full support, particularly from the developed\r\ncountries of the world. The Bahamas fulfilled its promise\r\nmade last year to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty, and pledges early ratification, in keeping with\r\nits commitment to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of nuclear war. These, along with other measures,\r\nbring us one step closer to the total elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe Bahamas is of the view that the United Nations\r\nshould serve as a pillar of support for the aspirations of\r\nits Member States and as a beacon of hope for the\r\ndestitute of the world. Let us therefore resolve to have\r\nthis fifty-second session of the General Assembly\r\nremembered as a decisive turning point in the work of the\r\nOrganization. It should be remembered as a session where\r\nMember States were able to attain a greater level of\r\nunderstanding, trust, cooperation and a sense of purpose\r\nto empower them to deal with the problems affecting the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Serge Vohor Rialuth,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe Assembly will next hear an address by the Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu.\r\nThe Honourable Serge Vohor Rialuth, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Russian):\r\nI have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Vanuatu, The Honourable Serge Vohor\r\nRialuth, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Vohor Rialuth (Vanuatu) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I am privileged today to be able to congratulate\r\nthe President, on behalf of the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Vanuatu, on his election to preside over the\r\nAssembly at a period critical to the life of the\r\nOrganization and its role in future relations between our\r\ncountries and peoples. I should like to assure him of the\r\nfull support and cooperation my delegation and my\r\ncountry will lend him and his country, Ukraine, during his\r\nmandate.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express\r\nthe warmest congratulations of the Government and\r\npeople of Vanuatu to the President of the preceding\r\nsession, Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, on the\r\nrole he played during a period in mankind’s history that\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nwill be noteworthy for a series of events that were\r\nimportant both on an international level and on various\r\nregional levels.\r\nThis is also a special opportunity for me to welcome\r\nthe new Secretary-General of the Organization, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, and to reiterate the support of the Republic of\r\nVanuatu for him in carrying out his mandate as Secretary-\r\nGeneral and, in particular, for the new initiatives he has\r\ntaken and committed himself to take in the process of\r\ndialogue and consultation with all Member States with\r\nregard to the future of the Organization.\r\nAfter more than 50 years of existence, the United\r\nNations today finds itself facing an economic and\r\ninternational political situation that is increasingly complex\r\nand particularly more difficult for small developing\r\ncountries in general, and especially so for the least\r\ndeveloped small island countries, like the Republic of\r\nVanuatu.\r\nThis situation should be recognized as one of the\r\nmajor challenges to the international community and one\r\nthat must be dealt with through more committed\r\ninternational cooperation, particularly favourable treatment\r\nbeing given to meet the specific needs of those countries\r\nand populations that are its victims.\r\nFor the Republic of Vanuatu, the highest priority\r\nremains the economic development and social well-being of\r\nits population, more than 80 per cent of whom live in rural\r\nareas or on islands far from the administrative and\r\ncommercial centre.\r\nThe maintenance of political stability and social\r\nharmony in a country depends and will continue to depend,\r\nfirst and foremost, on the country’s orientation and\r\neconomic development process. The rhetoric of certain\r\ndevelopment partners in trying to make their technical and\r\nfinancial assistance contingent on the political commitment\r\nof government leaders and on the maintenance of peace is\r\nfutile with regard to the Pacific region. Such rhetoric tends\r\nrather to challenge the very integrity of these leaders and\r\ntheir commitment to socio-economic development in their\r\nrespective countries.\r\nGenuine international cooperation must not only be\r\nbased on the high-priority socio-economic needs of the\r\ndeveloping countries and on the interests of the donors; it\r\nmust above all be anchored firmly in respect for the\r\nprinciples of sovereignty and mutual acknowledgment of\r\nthe competence of the national political authorities in the\r\nexercise of their functions in office. In the framework of its\r\nrestructuring and in the context of new international\r\nchallenges, the United Nations is called upon to play a\r\nleading role in international cooperation on the basis of\r\nthese new elements.\r\nIn this regard, the Government of Vanuatu most\r\nwarmly welcomes the Secretary-General’s initiative to\r\nestablish a special development account for the\r\ndeveloping country Members. I also wish to recall the\r\nimportance and role of regional and subregional forums\r\nin the process of establishing and strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation. In our part of the world, the\r\nSouth Pacific Forum and the Melanesian Spearhead\r\nGroup are concrete examples of such cooperation and\r\ntheir initiatives deserve the recognition and support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nOn 24 October 1995, during the commemoration of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, the head of the delegation of\r\nVanuatu declared from this rostrum the support of the\r\nRepublic of Vanuatu for the reform and rational\r\nmanagement of the United Nations system. Today, I\r\nreaffirm the support of my Government and congratulate\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the courage and\r\ndetermination that he has demonstrated in drafting and\r\nimplementing this crucial reform. I fully share the\r\nSecretary-General’s point of view when he emphasizes in\r\nhis report that “Reform is not an event; it is a process”\r\n(A/51/950, para. 25).\r\nIt is well known that, throughout today’s world,\r\nreform is also the sine qua non for a State’s sustainable\r\neconomic and ecological growth and development.\r\nIndeed, the global challenges that States must face require\r\nthe constant review and ongoing reform of development\r\npolicies and of the institutions of state, in order that the\r\nlatter may become instruments and tools adapted to and\r\nhoned for the accomplishment of specific tasks, while\r\ncontributing to the vision of development that we have set\r\nfor ourselves.\r\nSeventeen years after attaining its independence, my\r\ncountry, Vanuatu, has made great social and economic\r\nstrides. However, the disproportionate challenges facing\r\na small island State such as Vanuatu determined us to\r\ninitiate a reform programme early this year. This global\r\nreform programme, as we call it, covers the formal and\r\ninformal economic sector as well as the public sector, in\r\nthe broad sense of that word. With our reform, we would\r\nequip our country with the means to meet the major\r\ndevelopment challenges of the twenty-first century and to\r\navoid or reduce the effects and risks, natural and\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\notherwise, that stalk all developing countries and small\r\nisland States in particular.\r\nThis vision of the future that we have crafted for our\r\ncountry requires the creation of dynamic economic\r\nconditions in which the private sector is the major\r\nprotagonist. In most cases, attempts by Governments to act\r\ndirectly in the production of goods and services have purely\r\nand simply failed. It also requires the establishment and\r\ndevelopment of appropriate institutional machinery for\r\ntechnical and financial assistance that will promote the\r\ncreation, development and growth of private enterprise\r\nwhile placing greater responsibility in the individual.\r\nAs the General Assembly is aware, it is not enough to\r\ncreate conditions for the development of a dynamic private\r\nsector that is a driving force for growth if we seek\r\ndevelopment that is economically and ecologically\r\nsustainable and fair. Indeed, in our case, we consider the\r\nreform and revitalization of the State as another sine qua\r\nnon of this sustainable and fair development.\r\nHence, public administration must be made more\r\neffective and freed from any adverse political interference,\r\nallowing us thus to reestablish transparency, confidence,\r\nstability and the security of private investment. Our reform\r\nis designed above all to eliminate existing injustices and not\r\nto create others, which would represent failure and\r\nbacksliding. With our reform, we seek equitable\r\ndevelopment that takes into account the development needs\r\nof our children and of generations to come. The\r\nredistribution of the benefits of reform and the situation of\r\nwomen, children and other disadvantaged groups must be\r\nseriously considered in the implementation of this reform.\r\nGuaranteed fairness requires the assignment of the\r\nhighest priority to education through the allocation of\r\navailable resources. Only an up-to-date and high-quality\r\neducation will equip each individual with the necessary\r\nskills and allow him to satisfy his basic needs and maintain\r\nhis dignity.\r\nIt must be clear to all that the decision of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council on 18 July to graduate my\r\ncountry, the Republic of Vanuatu, from the list of least\r\ndeveloped countries was a surprise. I take this opportunity\r\nto reiterate the position of the Government of Vanuatu, as\r\nreflected in the official correspondence between my\r\nGovernment and the Secretary-General, the President of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and a certain number of\r\nfriendly countries Members of the United Nations.\r\nWhile recognizing the sensitive nature of this\r\nquestion, the Government of Vanuatu solemnly calls on\r\nthis Assembly to consider putting off the question of\r\ngraduation to the year 2000, when the indicators for\r\nidentifying least developed countries will be finalized by\r\nthe Committee for Development Planning.\r\nMy Government recently launched a global reform\r\nprogramme and will need the full support of the donor\r\ncommunity in order to implement our reform and give our\r\ncountry the infrastructure indispensable to our growth.\r\nSimilarly, during the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates held in Barbados, it was decided to develop\r\nindicators for the vulnerability index appropriate to this\r\ncategory of United Nations Member.\r\nIn this context, we consider the decision of the\r\nCommittee for Development Planning to be premature\r\nand in no way reflecting the spirit of that United Nations\r\nresolution. Moreover, with more than 80 per cent of our\r\npopulation living in the countryside on food-producing\r\nsubsistence agriculture; a well-paid expatriate population;\r\nand official development assistance equal to the State’s\r\nannual budget and representing 20 per cent of our gross\r\ndomestic product, we feel that the Committee for\r\nDevelopment Planning’s decision can only stem from a\r\nlack of adequate information.\r\nWe do not understand why least developed countries\r\nin the same situation as Vanuatu are treated differently\r\nand demand that we receive exactly the same treatment as\r\nany that, like us, meets two of the current identifying\r\nindicators for least developed countries, as laid down in\r\nthe Committee’s report.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAs recognized by the Rio Conference and the Global\r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States, held in Barbados, the issue of\r\nenvironment and its close association with the concept of\r\ndevelopment has become highly complex and sensitive.\r\nThe convening of international conferences and the\r\nformulation of international treaties such as the\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change are a clear\r\ndemonstration of the significance of environmental issues\r\nin our development efforts.\r\nSmall island countries like Vanuatu and other Pacific\r\nisland countries have taken some tough decisions to\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nintroduce restrictive measures internally in support of the\r\ninternational call for environment protection. They have\r\nalso committed their Governments and nations to the\r\nprinciple of instituting a legally binding instrument which\r\nwould guarantee the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions\r\nto an internationally accepted level.\r\nTo the Pacific island countries, particularly the low-\r\nlying nations, a failure to fully address the issue at hand\r\nand to reach an acceptable solution could put into question\r\nthe commitment of the international community, and could\r\nconstitute a great security risk for our islands and our future\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe Republic of Vanuatu recognizes the United\r\nNations initiatives and engagement in the globalization and\r\nliberalization of trade. The building up of the multilateral\r\ntrading system since 1995 is a manifestation and reflection\r\nof the United Nations effort and desire to create a global\r\nand uniform trading environment that is conducted and\r\nbased on the new rules and obligations provided in the\r\nMarrakesh Declaration.\r\nMy country has embarked on a wider process of\r\nconsultations to seek membership of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO). The challenges and opportunities\r\noffered by this new regime are considerable, and therefore\r\nweaker economies like ours require time to adjust to their\r\neconomic policies in order to accommodate the prescribed\r\nobligations and requirements of the multilateral trading\r\nsystem.\r\nIn this context, we would like to develop a common\r\napproach through the United Nations system, as well as the\r\nEuropean Union, as our partners, in coming to terms with\r\nthe demands and obligations of the newly established\r\nmultilateral trading system. While all of us, in particular\r\nsmall islands and least developed States, recognize the need\r\nto come to terms with the World Trade Organization, we\r\ncannot and should not allow ourselves to be unduly\r\npressured by its demands on these matters where we need\r\nto protect our trade preferences and interests.\r\nWhat we perceive to be negative and of less relevance\r\nto us in the World Trade Organization must be changed\r\naccording to our interests. There needs to be scope for all\r\nthe small and vulnerable States to be accorded sufficient\r\ntime to undertake reforms in trade and investment\r\ncompetitiveness with a view to creating a positive impact\r\non the economy, particularly in their efforts to source\r\nprivate capital flows and foreign direct investment.\r\nAllow me at this point to refer to the future relations\r\nbetween the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific States\r\n(ACP) and the European Union when the current fourth\r\nLomé Convention expires in the year 2000. After some\r\n25 years, it is important to take stock and reflect on the\r\nchallenges, opportunities and weaknesses of the\r\nConvention by reviewing the existing framework of\r\ncooperation. From a wider ACP perspective, there is\r\ngenerally a stronger desire and willingness to retain and\r\nstrengthen the existing framework of cooperation in the\r\nareas of political, economic, trade and development\r\nassistance.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to strongly urge\r\nthe international community, through this fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly, to recognize that there\r\nare realities which continue to warrant the need for\r\ncontinuity of the partnership between the ACP States and\r\nthe European Union beyond the year 2000.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm my\r\nGovernment’s support for the process of reforming our\r\ngreat Organization which was begun by Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nin order to enable it to deal successfully with the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Russian):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Mr. Serge Vohor Rialuth, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.05 p.m.\r\n18\r\n"
