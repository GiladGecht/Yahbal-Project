(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Papua New\r\nGuinea, His Excellency the Honourable Mr. Kilroy Genia,\r\nM.P.\r\nMr. Genia (Papua New Guinea): On behalf of the\r\npeople and Government of Papua New Guinea, I wish to\r\njoin previous speakers in conveying our felicitations to you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The Papua New Guinea\r\ndelegation is confident that you will guide this session to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to express my sincere\r\ngratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador\r\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia, for his energetic, visionary and\r\noutstanding stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly.\r\nAt the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\r\nworld leaders reaffirmed their resolute commitment to\r\nuphold the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. They pledged their support for the\r\npivotal role of the United Nations in building international\r\ncooperation and partnership in development and in\r\nengendering trust and confidence among nations and\r\npeoples in order to foster world peace and security.\r\nNo human institution is perfect, and the United\r\nNations is no exception. It has nonetheless withstood the\r\ntest of time. The shortcomings of our collective\r\nendeavours have necessitated efforts for constructive\r\nreform and measures directed at strengthening and\r\nreinvigorating the United Nations, our paramount\r\nOrganization.\r\nPapua New Guinea has always believed, and\r\ncontinues to believe, in the utility of the United Nations,\r\nand in this context commends the Secretary-General, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his bold initiative in\r\nproposing for our consideration a comprehensive reform\r\npackage aimed at making the United Nations more\r\nresponsive to the changing international situation.\r\nIn his proposal, the Secretary-General emphasized\r\nthat the principal objective of the reform is not only to\r\nmake the United Nations efficient and effective but also\r\nto improve its delivery system and operational coherency\r\nthrough management innovations. Papua New Guinea\r\nfully supports these principal objectives of the proposed\r\nreform package. The overall direction of reform should\r\nand must be tailored towards strengthening the United\r\nNations system in order to better serve the needs and\r\naspirations of its Members. It makes eminent sense for us\r\nto move from merely debating issues to determining\r\npractical steps and strategies that would make our\r\nOrganization more responsive and capable of meeting the\r\never-changing challenges of globalization and\r\nmodernization as we enter the next century.\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nThese changes are necessary to enhance public\r\nconfidence in the United Nations and to improve its\r\ncapacity to build partnership between Governments and\r\ncivil society. This will enable the Organization to meet the\r\ndaunting challenges of economic development faced by our\r\nglobal community and those posed by the political and\r\nideological differences afflicting nations today.\r\nThe proposed reforms stem in part from the need to\r\nensure the operational viability and sustainability of the\r\nactivities of the United Nations. Papua New Guinea is fully\r\naware of the predicament of the United Nations — starved\r\nof much needed financial resources for its operations to the\r\npoint of being insolvent. We cannot allow such a situation\r\nto persist.\r\nWe agree with and applaud the role of the\r\nOrganization in development — in framing structures and\r\npolicies that will enhance the technological capacities of\r\ndeveloping countries and improve their effective\r\nparticipation in international markets, including their access\r\nto credit and their ability to acquire information\r\ntechnologies.\r\nRegarding priorities, Papua New Guinea is gravely\r\nconcerned at the lack of full implementation of a number of\r\ninitiatives and programmes undertaken by the United\r\nNations, in particular with respect to such critical areas as\r\nthe empowerment of women, child care, the protection of\r\nour global environment, poverty eradication and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is critical to be aware that organizational reform\r\nalone cannot guarantee the effective delivery of services.\r\nThe United Nations needs more than bureaucratic and\r\ntechnocratic innovations. It needs our concerted action. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that we as Members commit ourselves\r\nto encouraging the development of genuine partnerships and\r\nseriously take urgent and practical measures to remove the\r\nobstacles and barriers that exist between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn addition to its traditional role in the maintenance of\r\npeace and security, this paramount international body must\r\nbe equipped and strengthened to do more in framing\r\ninternational treaties and standards and in encouraging\r\ninternational norms and practices that will bring about\r\nequitable economic development and social justice for all\r\npeoples. Equity and justice in all spheres of development\r\nshould be our ultimate objective.\r\nConsistent with the reform process, we see merit and\r\nvalue in revising the regional groupings within the context\r\nof the United Nations to reflect present geopolitical\r\nrealities. In this regard, we support the calls made by\r\nNew Zealand and others in the South Pacific region for\r\nthe consideration of their inclusion in the Asia-Pacific\r\ngrouping.\r\nI now turn to the question of the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, which is an important decision-making\r\norgan of the United Nations on global security concerns.\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Papua New\r\nGuinea fully supports the declaration adopted by the non-\r\naligned Ministers at the twelfth Ministerial Conference of\r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries — held in New\r\nDelhi, India, in April 1997 — and reaffirmed more\r\nrecently in New York on 26 September last. The\r\ncomposition and modus operandi of the Security Council\r\nmust reflect the changes that have taken place since its\r\nformative years, and, more importantly, must mirror\r\ncurrent geopolitical and economic realities.\r\nPapua New Guinea believes that the reform and\r\nexpansion of the Security Council should be guided by\r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States and\r\nequitable geographical distribution. It should also take\r\ninto consideration the need for transparency,\r\naccountability and democratization of the working\r\nmethods and procedures of the Security Council,\r\nincluding its decision-making processes.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should be\r\ncomprehensive and based on universal values in order to\r\nenhance its legitimacy. More importantly, the reformed\r\nSecurity Council should allow for equitable representation\r\nby developing countries. On the question of permanent\r\nmembership, we reiterate our position on the inclusion of\r\nJapan and Germany from the industrialized States and\r\nalso support the fair representation of developing\r\ncountries as additional permanent members, particularly\r\nthose that have the capacity and ability to contribute to\r\nworld affairs.\r\nPapua New Guinea strongly supports the view that\r\nthere should be no distinction in terms of the privileges\r\naccorded to permanent members, particularly in relation\r\nto the exercise of the veto power. In other words, all\r\npermanent members of a reformed Security Council\r\nshould enjoy the same privileges so as to maintain\r\ngeopolitical equity and balance.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nIt is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the\r\ncontradictory positions of some of our members, who\r\npurport to be champions and defenders of human rights\r\nissues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that\r\ndirectly deny genuine democratic representation and the\r\nrights of people to govern themselves in a manner\r\nconsistent with their political aspirations.\r\nHaving achieved decolonization in many parts of the\r\nglobe — of which the United Nations can be proud — we\r\nwould be failing in our noble duty if we were to ignore the\r\nconcerns and aspirations of the peoples of the remaining 17\r\nNon-Self-Governing Territories, some of them in the South\r\nPacific, which are still struggling to establish their own\r\npolitical autonomy, and even to exercise their right of self-\r\ndetermination. Given the importance we attach to this issue,\r\nPapua New Guinea is gravely concerned that recent\r\ninitiatives in relation to the United Nations programme on\r\ndecolonization have seriously eroded the importance of the\r\npolitical essence of that programme and have impacted\r\nnegatively on it. We hope that this anomaly can be resolved\r\nquickly and amicably.\r\nPapua New Guinea wishes to recall that many of us\r\nrepresented here would not have taken our place in this\r\nforum had we not been allowed the opportunity to exercise\r\nthat right. We therefore urge this body to adopt a more\r\nserious and aggressive approach to the implementation of\r\nthe decolonization programme of the United Nations. At the\r\nrecent meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Rarotonga,\r\nCook Islands, the States members of the South Pacific\r\nForum reaffirmed their support for the decolonization\r\nprocess.\r\nThe Non-Self-Governing Territory of New Caledonia\r\ncontinues to be of great interest to the South Pacific Forum,\r\nand we have over the years followed developments there in\r\nrelation to the Matignon Accords. Early this year we\r\nmounted, with the help of the Government of France and\r\nthe authorities in New Caledonia, a Forum ministerial\r\nmission to the Territory. We are pleased to note that all\r\nparties to the Matignon Accords appear to be satisfied with\r\nthe progress made in implementing the Accords. Papua\r\nNew Guinea continues to recognize the right of the people\r\nof New Caledonia to self-determination and urges all\r\nparties in the Territory to maintain their commitment to\r\nreaching a negotiated solution as a successor arrangement\r\nto the 1988 Matignon Accords. This negotiated successor\r\nsolution must take into account the wishes of all\r\ncommunities, including concerns on the changing\r\ndemographic composition of New Caledonia.\r\nThe economic prosperity and political developments\r\nand changes in the Asia-Pacific region continue to be of\r\ninterest to Papua New Guinea. As a special observer of\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),\r\nwe were heartened by the initiatives taken by ASEAN\r\nleaders to bring the belligerent parties in Cambodia to the\r\ntable for urgent negotiations for peace and security. It is\r\nour hope that the people of that ancient civilization will\r\nreturn to their daily lives in a peaceful and secure\r\nenvironment once more.\r\nThe ongoing difficulties in the Korean peninsula and\r\nthe competing territorial claims in the South China Sea\r\ncontinue to concern my Government, because they all\r\nhave a bearing on the overall maintenance of regional and\r\ninternational security, as well as on other forms of\r\ncooperation.\r\nWhile we do not understate the importance and\r\nvalue of our diplomatic relations with the People’s\r\nRepublic of China, we have, however, on a number of\r\noccasions urged both Beijing and Taipei to resolve their\r\nfundamental differences with the aim of maintaining an\r\namicable coexistence.\r\nIn view of the changing international climate\r\ncharacterized by global interdependence, it is important\r\nfor all peace-loving States to make every effort to\r\nminimize areas of hostility that could seriously undermine\r\ninternational peace and security. The United Nations\r\ntherefore has an obligation to assist in maintaining a\r\nsecure global environment in which economic growth and\r\nother forms of development can continue to thrive for the\r\nbenefit and common good of all peoples of the world.\r\nIn its efforts to attain economic prosperity, Papua\r\nNew Guinea has had to engage all economic entities in\r\nour trade and commercial relations. Consistent with our\r\nobligation to assure our people of a better future, we\r\nintend to expand our economic ties with trading partners\r\nthat have demonstrated their willingness to assist without\r\nour having to compromise various aspects of our existing\r\nrelations with our partners.\r\nIt is in this regard that we recognize Taiwan as a\r\ndynamic economy and trading partner without\r\ncompromising our one-China policy. Since Taiwan\r\nparticipates in such organizations as the Asian\r\nDevelopment Bank, the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council, the World Trade Organization and\r\nthe South Pacific Forum as a dialogue partner, I cannot\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nsee any reason why we should not deal directly with\r\nTaiwan on trade and economic matters.\r\nThe world has witnessed once again the derailment of\r\nthe peace process in the Middle East. We call on the\r\nleaders of both Israel and Palestine to cooperate with\r\nUnited Nations efforts to reach an amicable solution to\r\navert further violence, and to focus on the path to peace.\r\nPapua New Guinea strongly believes that the rights of the\r\nPalestinian people over their homeland and their freedom to\r\nestablish their own Government and identity are paramount\r\namong the conditions that could lead to enduring peace.\r\nWe are encouraged to see positive signs of\r\nappeasement in Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. Nevertheless, given the tense\r\nsituation that exists in that region, we urge those in\r\npositions of authority, including all leaders in that part of\r\nthe world, to resolve their differences peacefully to prevent\r\nfurther bloodshed. In this context, we are heartened to see\r\nthe Organization of African Unity playing a critical role in\r\nthe endeavour to bring about peace and stability in the\r\nGreat Lakes region. The crisis in Sierra Leone needs urgent\r\nattention, and we join the Secretary-General’s call to the\r\nleaders of the military junta and support his continuing\r\nefforts to encourage them to respect the rule of law and\r\nmake every effort to restore democracy in that country.\r\nOn the regional front, Papua New Guinea is taking a\r\nmajor initiative in setting up the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council (APEC) regional centre in Port\r\nMoresby. We would like to offer our gratitude for the\r\nsupport given by the States members of the South Pacific\r\nForum in our efforts to set up this centre. The objective of\r\nthe APEC centre is to assist in the area of capacity-building\r\nin the economies of 13 small island developing States in\r\nour region as we prepare to meet the challenges of\r\nglobalization and liberalization. We are also grateful for the\r\nsupport provided by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme.\r\nAt the recent summit of the Heads of the South\r\nPacific Forum countries, the leaders reaffirmed our\r\ncommitment to maintaining a nuclear-free zone in the South\r\nPacific consistent with the overall objectives of the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We\r\nwelcomed the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty and reiterated our support for banning the\r\ntransboundary movement of radioactive and other hazardous\r\nwastes in the region, and in particular for the Vienna\r\nConvention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the\r\ndraft Convention on Supplementary Funding.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the ratification by the\r\nUnited Kingdom of the protocols to the South Pacific\r\nNuclear-Free Zone Treaty, known as the Treaty of\r\nRarotonga. We are still hopeful that the United States of\r\nAmerica will do likewise, and call upon it to do so at the\r\nearliest possible opportunity.\r\nAt the last session of the General Assembly, we\r\nsought and forged new agreements, including our\r\nrelationship with the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons. We also expressed our support for an\r\ninternational convention to ban all anti-personnel mines,\r\nand have participated in the Ottawa process, most recently\r\nat Oslo. Like other members of this body, Papua New\r\nGuinea is making the necessary arrangements to become\r\na party to that historic Treaty when it opens for signature\r\nlater this year.\r\nIn a few months we will usher in the International\r\nYear of the Ocean. Like other South Pacific Forum\r\ncountries, Papua New Guinea has an affinity for the sea\r\nwhich cannot be overstated. It is, for the greater part, the\r\nsource of our livelihood.\r\nWe urge the United Nations to continue to play a\r\nmajor role in ensuring global awareness of sustainable\r\nuse, conservation and management of marine resources.\r\nIn this regard, we call on the international community to\r\ncoordinate efforts to implement the priorities agreed upon\r\nduring the special session of the General Assembly on the\r\nenvironment and sustainable development. We are gravely\r\nconcerned that much of the outcome of the special session\r\nwill remain the province of historians and academics, if\r\nnot given practical effect. We urge that greater attention\r\nbe given to the special needs and concerns of the small\r\nisland developing countries.\r\nAn environmental issue of great importance and\r\nrelevance to Papua New Guinea and other small island\r\nStates in the South Pacific region is the impact of\r\ngreenhouse gas emissions, which are causing rising sea\r\nlevels and changing weather patterns in many member\r\ncountries, especially low lying island nations.\r\nThis issue was given priority attention at the recent\r\nSouth Pacific Forum meeting in Rarotonga, Cook Islands,\r\nwhere the Forum countries expressed deep concerns about\r\nthe insufficient progress made by the countries which\r\ncontribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nAs a member of the South Pacific Forum, Papua\r\nNew Guinea strongly urges all countries concerned to\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nmake additional efforts in meeting commitments under the\r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\r\n(FCCC). We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider\r\nfully the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) draft\r\nprotocol during the ongoing negotiations, especially at the\r\nforthcoming Kyoto conference, in order to pursue the\r\ngreatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse\r\ngas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or\r\nother legal instrument.\r\nOn Bougainville, let me reassure this body that Papua\r\nNew Guinea, as I stated earlier this year in the United\r\nNations Commission on Human Rights, remains fully\r\ncommitted to a peaceful and enduring resolution of the\r\ncrisis. It is absolutely clear that the people of Papua New\r\nGuinea, including the majority of Bougainvillians, want\r\npeace and will pursue a peaceful solution by every available\r\nmeans. As in the past, we will continue to give the people\r\nof Bougainville every opportunity to participate fully in the\r\nreconciliation process.\r\nMy Government is mindful of the effects of the crisis\r\non our region, particularly of the spillover effects on our\r\nclose neighbours. We wish to take this opportunity to thank\r\nthe neighbouring countries in our region for their assistance\r\nin the peace process. I would like to acknowledge the\r\ncontributions of Australia and, in particular, New Zealand,\r\nin initiating and facilitating the peace conference of all\r\nBougainvillian leaders which resulted in the signing of the\r\nBurnham Declaration last July. A follow-up meeting —\r\nBurnham Talks II — between Bougainvillian leaders and\r\nrepresentatives of Papua New Guinea’s Government is\r\ncurrently under way in New Zealand. We are optimistic and\r\nconfident that we can resolve the crisis within the\r\nframework of the Papua New Guinea Constitution.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to thank, on behalf\r\nof my Government and people, the previous and current\r\nGovernments of the Solomon Islands and their people for\r\ntheir tolerance and understanding, particularly when they\r\nhave had to bear the full weight of the spillover effects. I\r\nwant to thank them also for agreeing with us to put in place\r\nin the last 12 months two important bilateral treaties: the\r\ncomprehensive framework treaty guiding bilateral relations\r\nand the basic border agreement. These treaties set the\r\nparameters within which our bilateral relations are\r\nconducted, including the legal mechanisms for consultation\r\nand dialogue relating to a more effective management of\r\nour common border, which is critical to the containment of\r\nthe Bougainville crisis, including its spillover effects.\r\nMy Government also offers its gratitude to the\r\nleaders of the South Pacific Forum for recognizing\r\nBougainville as an integral part of Papua New Guinea,\r\nand for their acknowledgment of the peace efforts\r\nconcerning Bougainville by all parties involved, including\r\nBougainvillians and their leaders, the Papua New Guinea\r\nGovernment, and the Governments of the Solomon\r\nIslands, Australia and New Zealand.\r\nIn conclusion, let me echo what other speakers have\r\nsaid before me. As we prepare to meet the dawn of the\r\nnext millennium, let us commit ourselves to building\r\ngenuine partnerships in development that will ensure a\r\nsecure environment for our present and future generations.\r\nWe do not and should not expect guarantees, but we\r\nshall look far and wide in our search for safeguards. We\r\ndo not want and shall not seek handouts; however, we\r\ndemand equity and greater participation to foster and\r\nexpand opportunities for our peoples.\r\nIt is only through the development of genuine\r\npartnerships and the enhancement of equity and justice in\r\nglobal trade and investments that we can improve the\r\nsocio-economic conditions of our people, ensure their\r\nprosperity, and guarantee the safety of our global\r\nenvironment, without which there is no hope for the\r\nattainment of enduring peace in our societies today and in\r\nfuture. Only when such peace has been attained can we\r\ntruly say that we have lived up to our obligations, for the\r\ninterests and common good of humanity.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister-Secretary\r\nGeneral of the Presidency of Mauritania, His Excellency\r\nMr. Ahmed Ould Minnih.\r\nMr. Ould Minnih (Mauritania) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): At the outset, I would like to say how pleased\r\nwe are to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the fifty-second session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. We are convinced that your\r\ngreat experience and wisdom will promote the success of\r\nthis session. I can assure you of the cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania in\r\nreaching the results to which we all aspire.\r\nI take this opportunity also to express our gratitude\r\nto and esteem for your predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, for\r\nthe great efforts made and the positive results obtained\r\nduring his term of office as President of the past session.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nI should also like to express our appreciation to\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nfor the tireless efforts he has made since his assumption to\r\nhis high office to promote the universality of the United\r\nNations and to strengthen its credibility and capacity to\r\ndischarge its responsibilities despite a difficult international\r\nsituation.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the initiative taken by the\r\nSecretary-General in submitting an outline for reform,\r\nwhich includes a number of provisions that could improve\r\nthe functioning of the Organization. An in-depth study of\r\nthis outline will undoubtedly facilitate its adoption by all\r\nmembers of the international community.\r\nWhile the end of the cold war has created a favourable\r\nclimate for the emergence of a new era of international\r\ndialogue and cooperation, the improvement of the economic\r\nconditions of developing countries remains an urgent need.\r\nIndeed, with the growing trend towards globalization\r\nand liberalization in international trade, the developing\r\ncountries are facing a number of obstacles, including slower\r\ngrowth, falling export revenues, and a reduction in the\r\nvolume of investments and in official development\r\nassistance. All of this may prevent these countries from\r\nbecoming part of the global economy and further\r\nmarginalize them if the international community does not\r\nmobilize swiftly to provide them with the aid they need to\r\nmeet these challenges.\r\nThe increase in the volume of debt is another obstacle\r\nto the economic and social development efforts undertaken\r\nby these countries for the benefit of their peoples. In this\r\nrespect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the\r\nburden of debt in many of the least developed countries has\r\nreached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them\r\nto continue with their economic reforms, which are of\r\ncrucial importance; and that this situation is exacerbated by\r\nthe fact that in 1996 official development assistance, which\r\ncan reduce the effect of indebtedness, fell to its lowest level\r\nin real terms in 23 years.\r\nInternational strategies do not seem to have succeeded\r\nadequately in easing the burden of debt in the developing\r\ncountries, which is why more effective solutions, such as\r\nincreasing official development assistance, must be found\r\nso that these countries’ development priorities can be\r\nfinanced.\r\nDespite the fragility of the international economic\r\nsituation, progress has been made in various areas due to\r\nefforts by the United Nations to promote international\r\ncooperation and to define policies and strategies capable\r\nof meeting the economic, social and environmental\r\nchallenges that confront the world today. For instance,\r\nseveral important international meetings and conferences\r\nhave been organized during the past five years under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, resulting in some\r\ndecisions and undertakings relating to the main issues of\r\ndevelopment that seek to promote international\r\ncooperation and coordination for development.\r\nI am referring in particular to the World Summit for\r\nChildren, held in New York; the Earth Summit, held in\r\nRio de Janeiro; the World Conference on Human Rights,\r\nheld in Vienna; the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, held in Cairo; the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, held in Copenhagen; the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing; the\r\nWorld Food Summit, held in Rome; the second United\r\nNations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II),\r\nheld in Istanbul; and the nineteenth special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, devoted to the overall review and\r\nappraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21, which took\r\nplace in New York last June.\r\nThese initiatives attest to the determination of the\r\nUnited Nations to take into account the concerns and\r\ninterests of the international community with regard to a\r\nwhole range of development issues. The United Nations\r\nshould continue on this path and seek to ensure\r\nimplementation of the decisions adopted.\r\nUnder the enlightened guidance of its President, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya, the\r\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania has completed the process\r\nof establishing constitutional institutions within the\r\nframework of a democratic process that began 11 years\r\nago. This ensures that these institutions will be able to\r\nfunction normally within a multi-party system and a State\r\nbased on the rule of law. My country is proud to state\r\nthat we do not hold any political prisoners.\r\nFundamental freedoms, such as freedom of\r\nexpression and a multi-party system, as well as trade\r\nunion freedoms, are guaranteed and enjoyed by 20\r\npolitical parties and a large number of organizations and\r\ntrades unions that can pursue their activities in complete\r\nfreedom. Likewise, there are dozens of newspapers and\r\nmagazines that reflect various political and intellectual\r\nsensibilities.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nFurthermore, in keeping with the provisions of our\r\nConstitution, the two Houses of Parliament have been\r\nreplenished, and for the second time presidential elections,\r\nset for 12 December this year, are being prepared in a\r\nclimate of freedom, peace and stability.\r\nA global strategy that seeks to raise the level of our\r\npeople’s economic and social development and to\r\nconsolidate democracy has been implemented. This goes\r\nhand in hand with the democratic process and is in keeping\r\nwith the following comments of the President of the\r\nRepublic, His Excellency Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed\r\nTaya:\r\n“We are seeking to build a modern society\r\ncapable of accompanying the world on its march\r\nforward and of assimilating scientific and\r\ntechnological information; a society aware of the\r\nchallenges of our time and working to meet those\r\nchallenges”.\r\nIn this context, the promotion of women’s rights and\r\nthe campaign against illiteracy figure prominently in our\r\ndevelopment programmes. A sustained effort is also being\r\nmade to provide as many of our citizens as possible with\r\naccess to education, jobs and health services, thereby\r\nguaranteeing them a better standard of living. The results\r\nobtained in this regard are satisfactory. Indeed, the\r\nenrolment rate in our schools has reached 86 per cent and\r\nhealth care coverage for our people has been significantly\r\nextended towards meeting the goal defined by the World\r\nHealth Organization, which is health for all by the year\r\n2000. Drinking water supply systems have been built in\r\nseveral regions, and the main cities of the country now\r\nhave electricity.\r\nWithin the framework of a huge programme to\r\nprovide access to remote towns in the interior of the\r\ncountry, several new roads have been built, and a modern\r\ntelecommunications system now covers the entire country.\r\nThese important achievements attest to our firm desire\r\nto combat underdevelopment in all its forms, relying first\r\non our own resources and then on the support of our\r\ndevelopment partners.\r\nI should like here to express my gratitude to all\r\nbrotherly and friendly countries and international\r\norganizations and agencies, as well as to non-governmental\r\norganizations, for their support of my country’s efforts in\r\nthis area.\r\nOne of the positive features of international relations\r\ntoday, which has led to the strengthening of democracy\r\nand respect for human rights in several regions of the\r\nworld, is the international community’s effort to\r\nconsolidate fundamental principles such as transparency,\r\nthe representative character of power, the primacy of law,\r\nand the independence of the judiciary.\r\nWhile we can be satisfied with the significant\r\nprogress made in this area, we should not lose sight of\r\nthe fact that democracy cannot be limited to the narrow\r\nconfines of each individual country; it must extend to\r\nrelations between nations. In this respect we attach\r\nparticular importance to the efforts made by the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. We also hope that these efforts will\r\nlead to greater transparency in the decision-making\r\nprocesses of the Security Council as well as to improved\r\nworking methods.\r\nIn a different area, we need to adopt a new form of\r\npreventive diplomacy that is capable of preventing\r\nconflicts and the human tragedies that result from them,\r\nsuch as those we have witnessed recently and those we\r\nsee today and yet are unable to resolve.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania expresses its\r\nprofound concern at the difficulties encountered in the\r\npeace process and at the negative developments in the\r\nregion of the Middle East, which result from non-\r\ncompliance with agreements concluded and commitments\r\nundertaken in accordance with the established timetable.\r\nMy country believes that there can be no just and\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East unless Israel withdraws\r\nfrom all the occupied Palestinian territories, including\r\nAl-Quds, the Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon, and\r\nunless the Palestinian people regain their right to create\r\nan independent State on their territory.\r\nMy country also calls for the taking of the steps\r\nnecessary for the resumption of the peace negotiations\r\namong all the parties concerned. We are convinced that\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\r\n425 (1978) and the principle of “land for peace” remain\r\nthe basis of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.\r\nFurthermore, we call upon the two sponsors of the\r\npeace process to redouble their efforts to ensure that the\r\nchance for peace is not lost and the hopes for a new era\r\nof cooperation and concord, in which the potential of the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nregion is dedicated to economic development and social\r\npromotion, are not dashed.\r\nIn this context, my country calls for the lifting of the\r\nembargo placed on the Palestinian people, and we ask the\r\ninternational community to mobilize the necessary resources\r\nto finance the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for\r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East so that it can do its job\r\nproperly.\r\nIn the Gulf region, the aftermath of the war continues\r\nto impede the normalization of the situation. The Islamic\r\nRepublic of Mauritania, while reaffirming its dedication to\r\ninternational law and its commitment to respecting the\r\nprinciples thereof, again states its rejection of any violation\r\nof Kuwait’s independence, its territorial integrity and the\r\nsecurity of its citizens, and calls for a rapid solution to the\r\nquestion of Kuwaiti prisoners.\r\nWe also reaffirm our steadfast position that no\r\nmeasures should be taken that threaten Iraq’s unity and\r\nterritorial integrity, and we call for the lifting of the\r\nembargo imposed against the Iraqi people, so that an end\r\ncan be put to their suffering. We hope that the\r\nimplementation of the resolution regarding “oil for food”\r\ncan help to achieve this.\r\nStill on the same region, we reiterate our support for\r\nthe United Arab Emirates in its desire to regain its\r\nsovereignty over the islands of Greater Tumb, Lesser Tumb\r\nand Abu Mussa.\r\nIn the Arab Maghreb, my country is acting in\r\ncooperation with its brothers for the attainment of the\r\naspirations of the States of the Union of the Arab Maghreb.\r\nOn the subject of Western Sahara, my country\r\nwelcomed with great satisfaction the agreement which was\r\nconcluded on 16 September last in Houston in the United\r\nStates under the auspices of Mr. James Baker III, the\r\nPersonal Envoy of the Secretary-General, and which deals\r\nwith the main issues that have hampered the\r\nimplementation of the settlement plan for Western Sahara\r\nworked out by the United Nations in coordination with the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). The Islamic\r\nRepublic of Mauritania reaffirms its willingness to do\r\neverything it can to promote implementation of the plan for\r\nthe settlement of this dispute.\r\nFurthermore, we call for the lifting of the embargo\r\nimposed against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and we hope\r\nthat the efforts of the League of Arab States and of the\r\nOAU to find a peaceful solution based on the principles\r\nof international law, a solution that will put an end to this\r\nsituation so detrimental to the Libyan people and all other\r\nMaghreb peoples, will be given favourable consideration.\r\nOn the question of Africa we hope that the meeting\r\nof the Security Council at the ministerial level held two\r\nweeks ago to consider the situation in Africa will\r\ncontribute to the achievement of appropriate solutions to\r\nthe problems of the continent.\r\nMy country also wishes to reaffirm its commitment\r\nto the principles of dialogue and negotiation as the only\r\nway to overcome crises and conflicts and to defuse\r\npockets of tension which exist in several parts of the\r\ncontinent. Accordingly, my country renews its support for\r\nefforts to revitalize the central organ of the OAU that\r\ndeals with prevention, management and settlement of\r\nconflicts in Africa.\r\nAs for the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros,\r\nmy country hopes that the efforts undertaken by the\r\nLeague of Arab States and the OAU will contribute to the\r\nsettlement of the crisis in that country.\r\nWe hope also that in Somalia the parties concerned\r\nwill have recourse to constructive dialogue to reach a\r\nsolution that will guarantee harmony and stability.\r\nIn regard to the Republic of Congo, my country\r\nhopes that a peaceful solution that will restore security\r\nand stability will be found.\r\nWe hope that there will again be a normal situation\r\nin Sierra Leone, in keeping with international law.\r\nThe United Nations is today required more than ever\r\nbefore to react more vigorously to the problems facing the\r\ninternational community. The end of the cold war, and the\r\ninternational community’s awareness of the importance of\r\ncoordination and dialogue, are positive factors for giving\r\nour Organization the necessary momentum to enable it to\r\nmeet the challenges and to establish the bases for a new\r\ninternational order founded on the principles of justice\r\nand solidarity and guaranteeing the maintenance of peace\r\nand security throughout the world.\r\nThere is no doubt also that being aware of the\r\nmagnitude of the challenges and the need to pool our\r\nefforts to meet them is the best way to restore our hope\r\nof moving closer to the fulfilment of the ideal that was\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nconsecrated at the ceremonies commemorating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Organization:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations united for a\r\nbetter world”.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Eritrea, His Excellency Mr. Haile Weldensae.\r\nMr. Weldensae (Eritrea): Allow me at the outset, Sir,\r\nto congratulate you on your election as President of the\r\nfifty-second session of the General Assembly. Eritrea joins\r\nin the expressions of recognition of your attributes by\r\nprevious speakers. You are presiding over an Assembly\r\nsession that will be remembered for focusing not only on\r\ncrucial international issues but also on the reform of our\r\nOrganization. While wishing you success in your\r\nleadership, I also assure you of the full support and\r\ncooperation of the Eritrean delegation.\r\nI also seize this opportunity to pay tribute to the\r\nPermanent Representative of Malaysia, His Excellency\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, for the way he conducted the\r\nwork of the fifty-first session, and to thank him for his far-\r\nsighted proposal on the reform of the Security Council.\r\nLikewise, I wish to extend sincere gratitude to the new\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor the efficient and dynamic way he is discharging his\r\nduties.\r\nWe are meeting at a critical juncture of history. After\r\nalmost 50 years the dark and ominous clouds of world\r\nconflict no longer loom threateningly over the horizon.\r\nThose grim days are over. In the last few years we have\r\ntaken great strides towards making the world safer for\r\nfuture generations.\r\nThe road to disarmament has been made easier with\r\nthe signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) by 146 world leaders in 1996. The world has also\r\naccelerated efforts to eliminate anti-personnel landmines.\r\nMore importantly, there seem to be clear indications of a\r\ngreat change in values, attitudes and perceptions which will\r\nfoster the creation of cooperative relationships among the\r\nStates of the world, thus promoting new perspectives of\r\ncommon policies to solve mutual problems.\r\nTrue, we should, at the same time, remember that old\r\nand new conflicts continue to plague the world. Thus,\r\ndestabilizing factors such as the marginalization of nations\r\nand peoples, transnational crimes, the use of violence and\r\nthe threat of violence as instruments of national policy\r\nstill haunt our planet. In addition, old and new conflicts\r\nin Europe, Asia and Africa seem to threaten or reverse\r\nthe global gains achieved in the last few years. It is hoped\r\nthat these will be the exceptions rather than the rule and,\r\nas relics of the past, will be swept away in the near\r\nfuture. In this respect, it is encouraging to note that the\r\nSecurity Council held, during the second week of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, an unprecedented ministerial meeting\r\non the security situation in Africa. This will encourage the\r\nUnited Nations to play a more meaningful and credible\r\nrole in supporting regional initiatives to solve regional\r\nconflicts.\r\nThus, perhaps for the first time, there is an\r\nopportunity to undertake a common, realistic and critical\r\nreappraisal of our involvement in world affairs and to\r\ncome to an agreement on the role of the United Nations.\r\nThe Members of the United Nations, both old and new,\r\nmust welcome this opportunity to demonstrate their\r\nreadiness to tackle these new global problems and the full\r\nintent of the contribution they can make to empower the\r\nUnited Nations to become a strong and relevant force in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nIn recent years, there have been persistent requests\r\nfor a change in the structure and mission of the United\r\nNations. There is undoubtedly need for reform. The most\r\nobvious reason is the fact that today the Organization\r\nremains essentially the same entity that was created over\r\n50 years ago in San Francisco. Its membership has more\r\nthan tripled since then, with at least two dozen new States\r\njoining since 1990. Yet, its structure remains essentially\r\nthe same. Also, the problems that face the world are so\r\nradically different that there is a dire need for the\r\nreorganization of priorities in the Organization’s mission.\r\nAlthough it is true that different States, or groups of\r\nStates, will have different perceptions of what needs to be\r\nchanged, the following are, in the opinion of my\r\ndelegation, the most important issues that must be taken\r\ninto consideration if change is to be meaningful and\r\ncredible.\r\nFirst, there are only two major challenges\r\nconfronting the world today: development and security.\r\nThese are, of course, interdependent. It is evident that\r\nthere will not be any development without peace. Yet,\r\nwithout development that improves the livelihood of\r\npeople, the task of guaranteeing peace will be extremely\r\ndifficult. The assaults on these two problems must be\r\nmade simultaneously, and all of our actions should be\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\ntaken with an eye to solving both. Hitherto, emphasis has\r\nbeen on security to the detriment of development, with\r\ncatastrophic results. Since the reason for this disparity,\r\nnamely the cold war, no longer exists, it should not be too\r\ndifficult to put a little more emphasis on development.\r\nLately, however, there has been a growing emphasis on the\r\npolitical rather than the economic aspects of\r\ndevelopment — that is, on democracy and human rights.\r\nTrue, people everywhere are clamouring for the right to be\r\nfree from dictatorships and to participate meaningfully in\r\ndecisions which affect their lives, and they must be strongly\r\nsupported in this. However, it must also be realized that the\r\nmeaning of human rights and democracy is being\r\nchallenged and questioned, and they are being given\r\ndifferent interpretations. Whatever the case, any effort to\r\napply standards of democracy and human rights, however\r\ndefined, will not be successful unless the root causes of\r\nunderdevelopment and poverty are effectively addressed.\r\nAny reform of the United Nations should, therefore,\r\nempower it to promote sustained economic growth in\r\ndeveloping countries even more energetically. Only this will\r\nhelp to develop good governance, that is, democracy and\r\nhuman rights and stability, and will militate against inter-\r\nand intra-State conflicts.\r\nSecondly, the United Nations belongs to all of its\r\nMembers. Thus, the increased participation of all of its\r\nMembers in its activities is a right that must be exercised\r\nto safeguard against the arbitrary abuse of its powers and\r\nfunctions. Such a development would enhance\r\nimmeasurably its effectiveness as a guarantor of peace. It\r\nis hardly possible to speak sincerely of a universal\r\norganization whose major decisions, taken by a few, will be\r\nbinding upon the rest of the world. It is no longer\r\nacceptable to the rest of the world that a relatively small\r\nnumber of States, even after the proposed increase of\r\nmembership in its major decision-making organs, should, in\r\nthe name of international peace and security, dictate the\r\nagenda of the United Nations or impose a system of\r\ninternational conduct. Indeed, it is sad to note that the same\r\ncountries that make democracy a condition in their foreign\r\npolicies are adamant about maintaining an elite club of\r\nStates in the consideration of Security Council membership.\r\nIn any case, any future system must eschew cold-war\r\ndoctrines and principles and give equal emphasis to social\r\njustice. Peace and justice are interrelated and cannot be\r\nmutually exclusive. There is thus no longer any excuse to\r\ndeny equitable representation in the major organs of the\r\nOrganization and undemocratically to deprive States of the\r\nopportunity to participate in the making of decisions which\r\nwill affect their destinies and the welfare of their peoples.\r\nThe United Nations will be in danger of being\r\nmarginalized if it does not take into account the needs\r\nand aspirations of most of its Members and does not build\r\ntrust between its Members, big and small, rich and poor,\r\nweak and strong. It can build such trust and mutual\r\nconfidence only if it makes sure that democratic norms\r\nand principles are accepted and practised by all its\r\nMembers.\r\nThirdly, this is the age of decentralization. Whenever\r\npossible, therefore, the United Nations must create the\r\nappropriate modalities to enable regional organizations to\r\nassume tasks which they will be able to execute more\r\neffectively. To this end, the General Assembly must take\r\nthe necessary steps to ensure a relevant role for regional\r\nand even subregional organizations, without losing its\r\nleadership role or eliminating its support.\r\nFourthly, the urgency of reform is recognized, but it\r\nwould be counterproductive to rush into decisions whose\r\nimplications we shall live to regret. Those who resent the\r\nveto power of the five permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council would be well advised to take the time,\r\nand to allow others to take the necessary time, to study\r\nissues before they make final decisions on such weighty\r\nmatters.\r\nSince its independence in 1993, Eritrea has\r\nembarked on a course of nation-building, reconstruction\r\nand renewal. In this endeavour, we were inspired by the\r\neternal ideas of our struggle, which enshrines justice,\r\nequity, human rights and equal opportunity to all,\r\nincluding, in particular, hitherto marginalized groups.\r\nIn the last six years — for we liberated our country\r\ntwo years prior to our declaration of formal\r\nindependence — we have taken the necessary measures\r\nto establish a regime of peace and marked stability in a\r\nregion of the world in which they have been absent for\r\nseveral decades; consolidate our profoundly democratic\r\ntradition of struggle by adopting a new constitution and\r\nholding our first democratic regional elections; create a\r\ndevelopment-oriented State and government structure;\r\nensure a corruption-free society; build schools and health\r\nfacilities in most regions of our country; and formulate an\r\neconomic and financial policy which fosters an\r\nenvironment that encourages investment and has thus\r\nmade our country a new frontier of widely expanding\r\nopportunities. These policies have yielded good political,\r\neconomic and social dividends that have enabled us to\r\nlook to the future with hope and optimism.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nIn our foreign relations, we have been guided by two\r\nbasic principles. The first is our deep conviction that, where\r\nthere is goodwill, all can be resolved through peaceful\r\nnegotiation without recourse to violence. A natural corollary\r\nof this belief is the firm conviction that all States,\r\nregardless of their ideological orientation, can live together\r\nin peace. This tenet underlies Eritrean foreign policy and\r\nhas guided its relations with all the countries of the two\r\nregions — the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa — in which\r\nit is located.\r\nThis has enabled it to establish an exemplary, close tie\r\nof friendship with Ethiopia, our erstwhile adversary. These\r\nclose relations and friendship have widely manifested\r\nthemselves over the last four years as we have coordinated\r\nactivities in the political, economic and social fields. It has\r\nalso helped us to defuse conflict and to arrive at a mutual\r\nagreement to resolve the conflict between us and the\r\nRepublic of Yemen over the Eritrean Hanish-Zukar\r\narchipelago on the Red Sea by the peaceful means of\r\narbitration. The State of Eritrea has time and again affirmed\r\nits adherence to the Agreement of principles of 21 May\r\n1996 and expressed its commitment to abide by the\r\ndecisions of the Arbitration Tribunal. Since both parties\r\nhave committed themselves to abide by the decision of the\r\nArbitration Tribunal, my Government feels that the dispute\r\nis already solved.\r\nUnfortunately, even the best of goodwill and intentions\r\ncould not help avert bad relations with our other neighbour,\r\nthe Sudan, which is bent on conducting a bad-neighbour\r\npolicy, is at odds with almost all of its neighbours and with\r\nothers beyond, and has, because of its avowed policy of\r\nexporting terrorism abroad, become an international pariah.\r\nThe second pillar of Eritrean foreign policy is an\r\nunswerving devotion to justice and equity. This policy\r\nemanates from Eritrea’s subjection to the horrors of\r\naggression and colonization at the height of the cold war.\r\nAt that time, our pleas to the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community fell on deaf ears. Because of this,\r\nwe are convinced that there are no substitutes for justice\r\nand equality for the purpose of ensuring the maintenance of\r\npeace in the world. These, too, have influenced our search\r\nfor friendship and cooperation with our neighbours as well\r\nas with other States. They have also underlined our efforts\r\nto bring peace and stability to our region and to achieve an\r\nearly end to the fratricidal conflict in Somalia, a just and\r\nfair resolution of the Sudanese conflict, and the\r\ndevelopment of economic, commercial and political\r\nrelations among countries of the region.\r\nThe conflict that has ravaged the Sudan for about\r\ntwo decades must be brought to an end. The absence of\r\npeace in the Sudan has had severe consequences for most\r\nof its neighbours. Thus, they have a substantial interest in\r\nthe restoration of lasting peace, security and stability in\r\nthe Sudan.\r\nTo this end, those of its neighbours which are\r\nmembers of the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) have, both collectively and\r\nindividually, exerted much effort during the past seven\r\nyears to promote an inter-Sudanese peace process. None\r\nof the members of IGAD has an interest other than\r\nushering in peace in the Sudan. All have favoured and\r\nencouraged dialogue, compromise and tolerance. They\r\nwere convinced that peace could be achieved on the basis\r\nof the Declaration of Principles formulated by IGAD after\r\na serious assessment of the objective reality prevailing in\r\nthe country. It is regrettable that until last month the\r\nSudanese regime had done all it could to subvert the\r\npeace process it had willingly accepted. It has now\r\naccepted the Declaration of Principles. We hope it will\r\nrespect its commitment and implement the provisions of\r\nthat Declaration. If and when it does, it will bring our\r\ninitiative to a successful conclusion and usher in peace\r\nand stability in the Sudan.\r\nI also wish to refer to the efforts made by IGAD\r\nconcerning the tragic situation which still exists in\r\nSomalia. It will be recalled that the members of IGAD\r\nhave both collectively and individually expressed deep\r\nconcern that this grave situation has continued for many\r\nyears and that no workable solution has yet been found.\r\nMany attempts to bring the concerned parties to the\r\nnegotiating table have failed. Where they have succeeded,\r\nno agreement could be achieved. Where agreements have\r\nbeen reached, they have been broken soon after.\r\nIn the global context, my country is fully convinced\r\nthat international cooperation is of vital importance. To\r\nensure sustainable development, Eritrea has been engaged\r\nin fostering regional integration and international\r\ncooperation because it is firmly aware of the importance\r\nof partnership in development. Eritrea believes that\r\npartnership can be ensured only when independence of\r\nchoice and recognition of equality and mutuality exist.\r\nWe in Eritrea are convinced that the world will\r\nbenefit from a strong, purposeful and dynamic United\r\nNations. We will therefore contribute, however modestly,\r\nto the creation of the conditions necessary to make it a\r\nreal force which will ensure international peace and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nsecurity that is broadly defined and premised on\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe note with great interest and welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals for reform. We are studying\r\nthem with care. We fully endorse the values and principles\r\nunderlying the objectives of reform, as enunciated in the\r\nSecretary-General’s address to the current Assembly,\r\nparticularly his reference to the new paradigms of\r\ncooperation.\r\nToday, I assure the General Assembly of our\r\ncommitment to the United Nations and to its new principles\r\nand purposes and its vision of a new world, as well as its\r\nsincere commitment to promoting genuine peace and\r\ndevelopment and defending the cause of small, weak States\r\nand vulnerable peoples. One would think that a nation like\r\nEritrea — which had been systematically betrayed by the\r\nUnited Nations during the past four decades — would have\r\nsecond thoughts about committing itself to the\r\nOrganization. However, we always believed that there was\r\nnothing wrong with the message of the United Nations, and\r\nwe had subscribed to it even in our days of struggle. Surely\r\nwe cannot blame the message for the shortsightedness of\r\nthe messengers. We urge others who share our feelings to\r\njoin us in giving the Organization the wholehearted support\r\nit now deserves and needs if it is going to be as effective\r\nas we wish it to be.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Tourism and Information of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, His Excellency the Honourable Alpian R. O.\r\nAllen.\r\nMr. Allen (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): I wish\r\nto congratulate you, Mr. President, on your unanimous\r\nelection. I am confident that under your leadership this\r\nsession of the General Assembly is well placed to address\r\nthe important issues on its agenda.\r\nCommendation is due His Excellency Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail for the balanced and effective guidance he provided\r\nduring the just concluded session.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to offer heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to our new Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, on his assumption of such a high and noble office.\r\nHe will no doubt bring fresh insights to bear on the\r\nHerculean tasks and problems confronting the United\r\nNations. We wish to indicate our support for his initiatives\r\nfor reforming the United Nations.\r\nIn spite of the many achievements of the United\r\nNations, much remains to be done. The world is still\r\nplagued by poverty, all manner of diseases — some even\r\ndefying medical science — terrorism, regional conflict\r\nand the menace of drugs. There can be no real peace or\r\nsecurity if millions of people go to bed hungry. There can\r\nbe no comfort if the rich man turns his back on the poor\r\nman and treats him as a statistic. It seems as if the moral\r\nobligation to help the disadvantaged has been totally\r\nabandoned in some quarters.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines remains a very\r\npeaceful country, with its cherished democratic\r\ninstitutions intact. Recently our judicial system, which is\r\nknown historically for its integrity, was put under\r\nmicroscopic examination with a view to discrediting it.\r\nThe test results reveal a clean bill of health. This painful\r\nperiod in our history has taught us many lessons. We\r\nknow now that there are friends who will smile with us\r\nwhile plotting our execution. Today it is true to say that\r\nmight is not right and that a small nation like ours can\r\nhave the fortitude to withstand attacks even from those\r\nwho may have the strength of Samson.\r\nOur banana pains continue to intensify. The\r\nprognosis appears to be very bleak. The recent World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) ruling has left us dazed and\r\nhelpless. The concept of every man being his brother’s\r\nkeeper has been shattered.Can we survive? Will our cries\r\nfor help go unheeded? What about our neighbours? Are\r\nthey deaf or uncaring? I know it now. Money and greed\r\nhave been elevated to the status of a religion, and care\r\nand concern are now regarded as a vice. Our future is\r\nnow on a life-support system. However, I am confident\r\nthat our resourcefulness and faith will see us through.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the idea of the\r\nestablishment of a zone of peace in the Middle East. We\r\ncall on all parties to take urgent and practical steps\r\ntowards the establishment of such a zone in accordance\r\nwith the relevant General Assembly resolutions adopted\r\nby consensus. We also call for a halt to the distribution\r\nand production of conventional weapons, which have\r\ncaused immense suffering, especially in this century.\r\nRecent acts of terrorism have given cause for great\r\nconcern. Why should innocent people continue to perish?\r\nThe United Nations Charter provides for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes. Both sides have rights which must\r\nbe respected. Violence can never be a solution. Let us put\r\nreason before bloodshed.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nWe should not rush to write the obituary for the\r\nMiddle East peace process. The wounds inflicted are not\r\nfatal; the haemorrhaging can be stopped and the process\r\nrevived.\r\nI look forward to the day when peace will break out\r\nin that ancient region, when men shall beat their swords\r\ninto ploughshares and into pruning hooks their spears.\r\nOur own hemisphere is not without problems. Our\r\nregion believes in neighbourly love, and any attempt to\r\ninflict pain and unjustified hardship on any of us affects all\r\nof us. Those who exert pressure, be it economic or legal,\r\nwill find no comfort in our bosom. The strategy of\r\ndiplomatic isolation has failed. It is clear that in the new\r\nmillennium, we cannot do business as usual. In hemispheric\r\nmatters, muscular diplomacy should give way to moral\r\nsuasion.\r\nDuring this year both Suriname and Haiti have become\r\nfull members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nWe take this opportunity to welcome them once again. We\r\nalso note the progress made since the reestablishment of\r\ndemocracy in Haiti, and we urge the international\r\ncommunity to continue to offer technical, material and\r\nfinancial help. That will enable the people of that country\r\nto deepen the process of democracy and to promote the\r\ncountry’s sustained economic and social development. I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to express my sympathy\r\nto the Government of Haiti in regard to the recent tragedy\r\nat sea.\r\nIn our region, nature has manifested its mighty force,\r\nand the people in Montserrat are now fleeing from an angry\r\nvolcano that erupts periodically. Our hearts are with the\r\npeople there, and we have done whatever we can to assist.\r\nEfforts to help are continuing at home even as I speak. Let\r\nus hope that the full extent of the plight of the people of\r\nMontserrat is realized by those who are in a position to\r\nmake a substantial contribution. Now is the time to stand\r\nup and be counted.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the convening in 1998 of a\r\nspecial session of the United Nations General Assembly\r\ndedicated to the fight against the illicit production, sale,\r\ndemand for and distribution of illicit drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances. Those who traffic in this trade can properly be\r\nregarded as merchants of death. International cooperation is\r\nthe only way to combat this menace.\r\nI wish at this time to pay tribute to a woman who has\r\ndied recently and whose name evokes mystic reverence.\r\nHer legacy is one of compassion. I speak of Mother\r\nTeresa. She embraced the poor, the sick and the suffering,\r\nthe favoured and the dispossessed. Her life shows that\r\neven in this cruel world there are still people who are\r\nwilling to put others before themselves in unrewarded\r\nservice. She lived her religion to the fullest. May she rest\r\nin peace.\r\nIt is our hope that the issue regarding Taiwan can be\r\nresolved peacefully. We urge those on both sides of the\r\nTaiwan Strait to hold discussions and negotiate a peaceful\r\nsolution in the reunification process to which both sides\r\nare committed. We of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\nare very grateful for the assistance we have received from\r\nTaiwan, and we would hope that the international\r\ncommunity would respect its contribution to development\r\nand that it may find its place in the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMy delegation will continue to support the\r\nfundamental rights of all peoples to self-determination.\r\nWe are heartened to see the emergence into sovereign\r\nstatehood and independence of peoples once under\r\ncolonial domination or foreign occupation. We reaffirm\r\nthe inalienable right of peoples of Non-Self-Governing\r\nTerritories to self-determination.\r\nThe reform and expansion of the Security Council is\r\nof paramount importance as we approach the dawn of a\r\nnew millennium. My delegation wishes to emphasize that\r\nthe ongoing discussions on the reform and expansion of\r\nthe Security Council must take into account the principle\r\nof sovereign equality of States and equitable geographical\r\ndistribution. There is also the need for transparency,\r\naccountability and democratization.\r\nMy delegation has no objection to the inclusion of\r\nadditional developed countries on the Council as\r\npermanent members, but we fully support the proposal\r\nthat all regions be represented in a permanent capacity,\r\nincluding Latin America and the Caribbean. The reform\r\ncannot be handled piecemeal. We will not support any\r\nchange that does not include Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean Community.\r\nExpansion of the Council must not and cannot be\r\nlimited to permanent seats. It is necessary to increase the\r\nnumber of non-permanent seats to give more countries an\r\nopportunity to serve on the Council within a relatively\r\nshorter time-frame. In addition, we recommend that the\r\nregional non-permanent seats be rotated among the\r\ncountries that are desirous of serving on the Council.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nIn this process we must remember and be guided by\r\nthe word “democracy”. If this body is to have the moral\r\nauthority to restore or encourage democracy in some\r\nMember States, it must first become fully democratic.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines remains a loyal and\r\ndedicated member of the United Nations committed to\r\nupholding the noble principles of the Charter. Now more\r\nthan ever before we must reaffirm our collective respect for\r\nthe fundamental principles of the Charter. The small nations\r\nof the world must receive constant reassurances from the\r\nlarger nations that their interests will be safeguarded, their\r\nsovereignty respected.\r\nWhen we speak of the United Nations, we must\r\nproject our vision beyond this building. In the end it is our\r\ndeeds that will count. Yes, it is what we do to the least of\r\nour brethren. Promises and statements have no meaning\r\nunless they can be translated into action. This body must\r\nnever be perceived as a gathering of word merchants but,\r\nrather, as one of action-oriented men and women.\r\nOur planet’s resources are finite, and even the most\r\neconomically developed States cannot pursue unilateral\r\npolicies in isolation from the rest of the world.\r\nWe stand firm in the belief that the United Nations is\r\nstill the best hope for the world. This hope must be\r\ngrounded in action, in a firm resolve to act decisively in the\r\nbest interests of this great institution — indeed in the\r\ninterest of all humanity and untainted by the narrow\r\nnational interests that have dogged our path during the last\r\nfive decades.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and International Cooperation of Kenya, His\r\nExcellency the Honourable Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka.\r\nMr. Musyoka (Kenya): Allow me, at the outset, to\r\nconvey to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation, my warm\r\ncongratulations on your election as the President of the\r\nfifty-second session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. I am confident that your work will meet with\r\ngreat success throughout the session, particularly in guiding\r\nus in the task of reforming and restructuring the United\r\nNations in preparation for the challenges ahead.\r\nI would like to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nAmbassador Razali Ismail, Permanent Representative of\r\nMalaysia, for the excellent manner in which he conducted\r\nour deliberations during the previous session.\r\nI also take this opportunity to commend the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his vision and\r\ndevotion to the service of the United Nations.\r\nThe creation of the United Nations by the founding\r\nfathers was a courageous decision. Although their\r\nobjectives are yet to be fully realized, Kenya is convinced\r\nthat they are still valid, and we remain fully committed to\r\ntheir achievement. The world has undergone tremendous\r\ntransformation since the signing of the United Nations\r\nCharter in San Francisco 52 years ago. We have\r\nwitnessed the end of the East-West military and political\r\nrivalry, which at times crippled decision-making in the\r\nUnited Nations system. New opportunities have emerged\r\nand the role of the United Nations has diversified, with\r\nthe international community placing greater expectations\r\non the Organization.\r\nUnder the able leadership of His Excellency\r\nPresident Daniel T. arap Moi, Kenya has undertaken bold\r\npolitical and economic reforms whose benefits we are\r\nbeginning to realize. We are committed and determined\r\nto continue forging national unity to enhance the process\r\nof democratization and socio-economic development.\r\nIt is against this background that I wish to address\r\nsome of the issues contained in the agenda of this session.\r\nIn recapping the events of the past years, we note\r\nthat the United Nations has made efforts to secure\r\ninternational peace and security. We regret that the peace\r\ndividend expected after the cold war has not materialized.\r\nInstead, the total volume of assistance to developing\r\ncountries has declined, and the scourge of conflicts in\r\nvarious parts of the world, and in Africa in particular, has\r\nrevealed the frightening proportions of ethnic and\r\nnationalistic hostilities and humanitarian crises. Intra-State\r\nconflicts have torn some of our nations apart, as they\r\npose threats to security, social cohesion and economic\r\nprogress.\r\nSome of these conflicts have proved difficult to\r\nprevent, manage or resolve. They have caused diversion\r\nof resources from developmental purposes to non-\r\nproductive use. Kenya believes in the peaceful resolution\r\nof conflicts and encourages the settlement of disputes\r\nthrough negotiations, mediation, conciliation and\r\narbitration as opposed to use of force. His Excellency\r\nPresident Daniel T. arap Moi, along with other leaders in\r\nAfrica, has spent considerable time and resources\r\ncoordinating peace initiatives in southern Sudan, Somalia,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nBurundi, Rwanda and the former Zaire, among other places.\r\nWe are happy to report that the stalled peace process\r\nconcerning the conflict in southern Sudan was re-energized\r\nfollowing the extraordinary Summit of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) held\r\nin Nairobi on 8 and 9 July 1997, at which the Sudanese\r\nGovernment accepted the Declaration of Principles, which\r\ncalls on all factions to work together. In addition, during\r\nthe IGAD Ministerial meeting held in Nairobi on 22\r\nSeptember 1997, the parties to the conflict agreed on 28\r\nOctober 1997 as the date for the next meeting. Kenya\r\nbelieves that the parties must have the courage and political\r\nwill to negotiate in good faith. It is equally important for\r\nthe international community to actively support this process\r\nby making financial resources available as well as by\r\nexerting pressure on all the parties to rededicate themselves\r\nto finding a lasting solution to the conflict. We pay tribute\r\nto the IGAD Partnership Forum for its supportive role vis-\r\nà-vis the IGAD initiative.\r\nThe prolonged conflict in Somalia remains a matter of\r\ngreat concern to Kenya. The continued absence of that\r\nsisterly State among the family of nations is indeed\r\nregrettable. We maintain that reconciliation of the warring\r\nfactions is critical to finding a just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive peace settlement to the conflict. The\r\ninternational community, in particular the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development, the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and the United Nations, has an important role\r\nin assisting in the process of reconciliation.\r\nThe crisis in the Republic of Congo is similarly a\r\nmatter of grave concern to Kenya. We are concerned that\r\nthree months have elapsed since the President of Gabon,\r\nOmar Bongo, called upon the Security Council to deploy a\r\nUnited Nations force to assist in normalizing the situation\r\nin that country. We wish to reiterate the OAU position\r\nstated at the recent Security Council ministerial meeting —\r\nnamely, that there is a need for urgent intervention by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLikewise, the situation in Burundi is also of concern\r\nto my country. We support the efforts by Mwalimu Julius\r\nNyerere to find a negotiated solution to the problem in that\r\ncountry. We urge President Pierre Buyoya to take into\r\naccount the concerns of the subregion and the international\r\ncommunity in general and work towards a negotiated\r\nsettlement.\r\nKenya wishes to reiterate the position taken on the\r\nconflict in Sierra Leone by the thirty-third session of the\r\nOAU Conference of Heads of State and Government, held\r\nin Harare, Zimbabwe, in June 1997, that the international\r\ncommunity desist from recognizing the military junta. We\r\nsupport the efforts by the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) in the search for a solution to\r\nthe crisis in that country and urge the junta to return\r\nSierra Leone to constitutional rule. We are convinced that\r\nquick and effective action by the international community\r\nis necessary, as underscored by President Tejan Kabbah\r\nduring his intervention before the Assembly on 1 October\r\nlast.\r\nMy Government is also concerned with the political\r\ndevelopments in the Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros. We support the efforts by the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity aimed at bringing the Government and\r\nother parties together with a view to seeking a solution to\r\nthe problem. We urge the people of the Comoros to work\r\ntowards maintaining the sovereignty, national unity and\r\nintegrity of their country.\r\nKenya has been involved in the peace process in\r\nAngola since 1975. We are encouraged by the progress\r\nthat has been made towards finding a peaceful solution to\r\nthe prolonged crisis in that country. However, we wish to\r\nreiterate the need for both parties, in particular UNITA,\r\nto cooperate fully in the implementation of the Lusaka\r\nProtocol, the agreed framework for peace in Angola. At\r\nthis point in time, any alternative will only hurt the\r\npeople of Angola.\r\nOn a positive note, we are encouraged by the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and ECOWAS\r\nthat enabled Liberia to hold successful elections, won by\r\nPresident Taylor. In this regard, we commend the efforts\r\nof ECOWAS, the international community and the\r\nLiberian people for the manner in which the elections\r\nwere concluded. We wish Liberia success in the difficult\r\ntask of reconstruction and post-conflict peace-building.\r\nKenya believes that a continued United Nations\r\npresence and focused support of the international\r\ncommunity are critical in the rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction of Liberia, including the repatriation and\r\nreintegration of refugees. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s intention to establish a peace-building support\r\noffice in Monrovia upon the termination of the mandate\r\nof the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia\r\n(UNOMIL). We are convinced that this will assist the\r\nnew Government in its efforts to rebuild Liberia’s\r\neconomy and contribute towards the promotion of peace\r\nand stability in the region.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nKenya welcomes the recent movements towards the\r\nresumption of negotiations by the parties to the conflict in\r\nthe Middle East. We wish to urge them to honour in good\r\nfaith the Oslo agreements they have entered into and to\r\nrefrain from activities that have the potential of\r\nundermining the peace process. There is a need for the\r\nGovernment of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to\r\nresume dialogue in order to resolve all outstanding issues.\r\nKenya will continue to support the parties in their search\r\nfor a just, durable and comprehensive peace.\r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative in\r\nCyprus and the efforts of the international community to\r\nbring the parties to the negotiating table. In this respect, we\r\napplaud the face-to-face intercommunal talks held in\r\nSwitzerland on 11 August last. The world would like to see\r\nboth the Greek and Turkish Cypriots resolve their problem\r\nof more than two decades. There is therefore a need to\r\nintensify efforts to find a durable solution to that problem.\r\nWe call upon the international community to also support\r\nthe talks by exerting pressure on both sides and to refrain\r\nfrom activities that might be seen as impeding the peace\r\nprocess.\r\nThe humanitarian emergencies accompanying these\r\nconflicts require an urgent response from the international\r\ncommunity. Thousands of people are affected in one way\r\nor another. Refugees and displaced persons are experiencing\r\nvarying degrees of suffering on a daily basis. While\r\nreiterating our support for the work of the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and of the international\r\ncommunity, we feel that it is vital to enhance closer\r\ncoordination and cooperation between all actors to facilitate\r\nthe complementarity of efforts.\r\nWe are committed to the promotion of universal\r\nhumanitarian principles and international humanitarian law.\r\nKenya, indeed, has been host to thousands of refugees from\r\nour region. We have stretched our meagre resources to\r\naccommodate the refugees but regret that some of them\r\nhave abused our hospitality and caused problems of\r\ninsecurity in our own country. We urge the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees to work closely with the\r\nGovernment of Kenya in monitoring and verifying the\r\ngenuineness of the refugees in order to address this\r\nproblem.\r\nKenya and other African countries have contributed\r\ntroops to various United Nations peacekeeping missions\r\nworldwide. We view the reluctance by the international\r\ncommunity to support operations in Africa as a departure\r\nfrom the Charter responsibilities of the United Nations. We\r\nrecognize that concerted efforts by the countries affected\r\nand others in the region are necessary in the settlement of\r\nconflicts. The involvement of regional organizations in the\r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts should\r\ntherefore not entail any derogation of the responsibilities\r\nof the United Nations. We wish to reaffirm that the role\r\nof peacekeeping and peace enforcement throughout the\r\nworld must remain the responsibility of the United\r\nNations and in particular of the Security Council, in\r\naccordance with the Charter. In this respect, Africa\r\nexpects to see swift handling of the conflict in the Congo\r\n(Brazzaville), in much the same way as was the case in\r\nthe Balkans.\r\nMy country welcomes the results of the Oslo\r\nDiplomatic Conference on an International Total Ban on\r\nAnti-Personnel Landmines. This constitutes a significant\r\ncontribution to the realization of ending the use of\r\nweapons that have wreaked havoc in many parts of the\r\nworld. Kenya commends the international community for\r\nits efforts to bring to an end the use of these deadly\r\nweapons.\r\nA prominent feature in recent years has been the\r\nincreasing globalization of the world economy. Although\r\nthe global economy continues to show modest growth,\r\nwith the highest performance being experienced in East\r\nAsia, Africa’s economy still lags behind. The continent\r\nremains highly vulnerable to adverse international\r\neconomic policies and natural calamities due to its limited\r\ncapacity to respond. The economy is characterized by\r\npoverty and underdevelopment. The per capita incomes\r\nare the lowest in the world, and most of the countries are\r\nunable to feed their growing population. At the same\r\ntime, the marginalization of the continent continues, with\r\nunsustainable external debt being a major factor.\r\nWe welcome the measures taken by the international\r\ncommunity at the bilateral and multilateral levels to\r\nmitigate the debt burden. It is evident, however, that\r\nAfrica’s indebtedness continues to be a major constraint\r\nin the economic development of the continent despite\r\nefforts by many countries to implement economic\r\nreforms. These efforts have not met with adequate\r\nbilateral and multilateral financial support, resulting in\r\nlimited prospects for economic growth. We underscore\r\nthat the reduction or cancellation of both the bilateral and\r\nmultilateral debt of the heavily indebted countries needs\r\nserious consideration. Kenya urges the international\r\ncommunity to seriously address the external debt crisis.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nIn addition, we regret that the agreed official\r\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent has not been\r\nmet by most donor countries but has, as a matter of fact,\r\ndeclined to approximately 0.25 per cent. Hence, the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Agenda for\r\nDevelopment should address all these issues and place\r\nAfrica in its proper perspective. We appeal to the\r\nindustrialized countries to reverse the declining trend in\r\nofficial development assistance and to honour their\r\ncommitments by attaining the agreed target. Kenya believes\r\nthat to achieve good results, development must be people-\r\noriented and involve all actors, with emphasis on human\r\nresource development, application of science and\r\ntechnology, and the creation of employment and income-\r\ngenerating opportunities.\r\nAfrica has abundant human and natural resources,\r\nwhich, if properly harnessed, could generate wealth for the\r\npeople of the continent. Kenya is committed to the\r\npromotion of South-South cooperation and urges that\r\nnecessary measures be taken to ensure effective\r\ncollaboration. In this regard, Kenya and other countries of\r\nthe region are promoting regional cooperation in order to\r\nintegrate our economies in the long run. We wish to appeal\r\nto our partners to complement these efforts by intensifying\r\ntechnical and financial support. We underscore that without\r\nsocial and economic progress it is difficult to achieve\r\npeace.\r\nThe liberalization of trade regimes and the promotion\r\nof an open and secure multilateral trading system are vital\r\nrequirements for the acceleration of economic development.\r\nAs a member of the World Trade Organization, Kenya is\r\ncommitted to the liberalization of both trade and investment\r\nregimes. In this regard, unilateral protectionist actions,\r\nwhich are inconsistent with multilateral trade agreements,\r\nshould not be allowed to interfere with these arrangements.\r\nKenya is committed to the implementation of the\r\noutcomes of the various United Nations conferences, such\r\nas the Rio United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, the Cairo International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, the Copenhagen World\r\nSummit for Social Development, the Beijing Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, the Istanbul United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) and the\r\nRome World Food Summit, among others. We are\r\ndisappointed that the outcome of these conferences has to\r\na large extent remained unimplemented. In the course of\r\nimplementing Agenda 21, my country has initiated\r\ninnovative steps to protect and preserve the ecosystem.\r\nThese include public awareness programmes, environmental\r\neducation and the Great Rift Valley Conservancy\r\nProgramme, which ensures integrated utilization of land.\r\nWe urge the international community to honour their\r\ncommitments by making available new and additional\r\nresources for the attainment of the intended objectives.\r\nAs the United Nations continues to introduce\r\nmeasures to ensure reduction of waste, it is imperative\r\nthat the Organization ensure maximal and rational use of\r\nthe existing facilities within the United Nations system.\r\nAs host to the only United Nations headquarters in the\r\ndeveloping world, we are concerned that the facilities at\r\nthe Nairobi offices are underutilized. In this regard,\r\nKenya wishes to see maximal utilization of the facilities\r\navailable in Nairobi, the headquarters of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and of the\r\nUnited Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat).\r\nWe therefore wish to urge that General Assembly\r\nresolutions requiring meetings to be held at their\r\nrespective headquarters should, to the extent possible, be\r\nadhered to.\r\nWe are further concerned that both UNEP and\r\nHabitat suffer from inadequate funding despite their\r\nenormous potential. We note that these two United\r\nNations bodies need to be strengthened by streamlining\r\ntheir administrative and financial management. Above all,\r\nthey require adequate and predictable financial resources\r\nfrom all sources in order to fulfil their mandates. In this\r\ncontext, we would like to request the Secretary-General\r\nto expedite the implementation of measures expected to\r\nrevitalize the two institutions. In addition, we wish to\r\nappeal to the donor community to honour their financial\r\ncommitments and release any blocked funds to enhance\r\nthe effective operation of UNEP and Habitat. Kenya will\r\ncontinue to ensure that the United Nations offices in\r\nNairobi operate in a smooth environment.\r\nThe challenges facing the Organization in the next\r\nmillennium are many and complex. It is imperative that\r\nthe Organization be restructured to enable it respond\r\nadequately to new priorities and challenges. In this\r\nrespect, we wish to commend the Secretary-General for\r\nunveiling reform measures and proposals that will form\r\nthe basis of our discussion. We urge the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to speedily implement measures within his\r\nmandate to reduce waste and ensure effective utilization\r\nof existing facilities and better coordination and\r\ncooperation within the United Nations.\r\nKenya is committed to the reform of the United\r\nNations and will continue to participate actively in the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\ndebate. We expect that the reforms will be carried out with\r\ntransparency, and in full compliance with the democratic\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. In our view, the\r\nOrganization requires not radical transformation but rather\r\nthe strengthening and modification of its structures and\r\norgans to enhance its effectiveness.\r\nIn reforming the United Nations, it is of paramount\r\nimportance for Member States to recognize that unpaid\r\ncontributions constitute a major obstacle to the effectiveness\r\nof the Organization. We are concerned that the United\r\nNations is facing a financial crisis which is due basically to\r\nMember States not honouring their Charter obligations. For\r\nthe United Nations to fulfil its mandate effectively, there is\r\nneed for stable, predictable and adequate financing. We\r\ntherefore urge Member States to take concrete action to\r\nclear their arrears without conditionalities. Furthermore,\r\nadjustment of the scale of assessments ought to be the\r\nresult of a collective decision to redistribute the financial\r\nburden while bearing in mind the principle of capacity to\r\npay.\r\nKenya considers that the Security Council should be\r\nreformed to make it possible to achieve transparency,\r\naccountability, democratization and balanced regional\r\nrepresentation. We reaffirm the position of the Organization\r\nof African Unity calling for the enlargement of the Council\r\nin both categories of membership to a total of 26 seats. We\r\nreiterate that Africa should be allocated at least two\r\npermanent and five non-permanent seats in the reformed\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe also support reforms in the economic and social\r\nfields which should enhance complementarity and better\r\ncoordination of the activities of the Council. The Economic\r\nand Social Council should assume effective coordination of\r\ninternational policies and the activities of the specialized\r\nagencies. Further, it should ensure mobilization of resources\r\nfor the operational activities which are critical for the\r\nachievement of socio-economic development. We are\r\nconvinced that strengthening and revitalizing the functions\r\nof the Economic and Social Council will accelerate\r\ndevelopment, particularly in the areas of poverty alleviation,\r\nenvironment degradation, health and humanitarian\r\nassistance, among other areas.\r\nI should like to conclude my statement by reaffirming\r\nKenya’s readiness to support measures that will strengthen\r\nthe United Nations and turn it into a more focused and\r\nintegrated Organization able to steer humanity into the next\r\nmillennium. Let us all strive to make the Organization more\r\neffective in serving mankind in the years to come. We are\r\ndetermined to make our contribution.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe general debate.\r\nA number of delegations have asked to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply. I remind members that, in\r\naccordance with decision 34/401, statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply shall be limited to 10 minutes for the\r\nfirst intervention and to five minutes for the second, and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Sarris (Greece): I have asked to speak in order\r\nto respond to a statement made by the Deputy Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Turkey last Friday, 3 October. It is\r\nregrettable that Turkey has chosen this debate to attack\r\nmy country and introduce an element of strident\r\nconfrontation at the present time, when the international\r\ncommunity is conscientiously striving for bridge-building\r\nand peaceful cooperation in addressing the outstanding\r\nworld issues. The Turkish Deputy Permanent\r\nRepresentative abused his right of reply in order to\r\npresent Greece as a party at fault, by using doubletalk,\r\ndistortion and misinformation.\r\nI would like to refer to the statement my Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs made to the Assembly in order to\r\nconfirm that we remain committed to a positive approach\r\nin our relations with Turkey — without forgetting,\r\nhowever, that none of the problems we are facing are of\r\nour own making: because it is a fact and not propaganda\r\nthat since 1974 Turkey has presented an open-ended\r\nagenda of claims that converge into the single objective\r\nof revising the status quo in the Aegean; that Greece has\r\nbeen under the pressure of systematic Turkish claims over\r\nour sovereign rights and responsibilities conferred by\r\ninternational agreements; that since January 1996 Greece\r\nhas faced the aggressive manifestations of direct territorial\r\nclaims, which our neighbour was prepared to back with\r\nmilitary action; that Turkey, challenging existing treaties\r\nafter more than 70 years, has successively claimed the\r\nImia islets as well as an undetermined number of islands\r\nin the Aegean, the island of Gavdhos, which is south-west\r\nof Crete, and unspecified “grey areas in the Aegean”,\r\n“any island that is not specifically mentioned by name in\r\na treaty”, and “geographical formations whose status is\r\nnot determined by international agreements”.\r\nIn order to deny these facts, the Turkish Deputy\r\nPermanent Representative has distorted realities. Such a\r\ndistortion is the Turkish representative’s allegation that\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nGreece ignores international law as far as its national\r\nairspace is concerned, although Turkey had respected from\r\n1931 the delimitation of Greek airspace to 10 nautical\r\nmiles.\r\nConcurrently, Turkey has tried to dispute Greece’s\r\nright to extend its territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles,\r\na right stemming from international law as codified by the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and has\r\nrepeatedly threatened that the exercise of this legitimate\r\nright would be a cause of war, thus violating Article 2 of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nMoreover, Turkey seeks to impose a status of\r\ndefencelessness on the Aegean islands in order to have\r\nthem at the mercy of the considerable military forces\r\nconcentrated on the Turkish coast. The examples of the\r\nCyprus invasion of 1974 and the repeated invasions of Iraqi\r\nsoil by the Turkish army clearly convince us of the\r\nsoundness of our decision to take all necessary measures in\r\naccordance with international law in order to prevent any\r\nnew instances of such “peacemaking” by our neighbours.\r\nThe legal regime in the Aegean is clearly defined by\r\ninternational treaties, and especially by the 1923 Treaty of\r\nLausanne. Boundaries exist there, either through\r\ninternational agreements or through provisions of\r\ninternational law. Turkey asserts that the whole range of\r\narbitrary claims it has put forward concerning Greek\r\nsovereignty or sovereign rights in the Aegean should be\r\n“resolved through dialogue”, a convenient code for\r\nnegotiations without reference to the rules and principles of\r\ninternational law. Such a dialogue is unacceptable for any\r\ncountry, because it would legitimize claims that have no\r\nfoundation in international law. One cannot conduct a\r\ndialogue with a neighbour that intends to acquire parts of\r\none’s sovereign territory.\r\nGreece has proposed a step-by-step procedure destined\r\nto improve the state of relations with Turkey. The\r\nprocedure provides for the reference by Turkey of its\r\nterritorial claim over the islet of Imia to the International\r\nCourt of Justice, for recourse by Greece and Turkey to the\r\nsame international instance to resolve the outstanding issue\r\nof the delimitation of the continental shelf and for\r\nresumption of the dialogue previously conducted on a series\r\nof bilateral issues.\r\nContrary to my colleague’s assertion, the Turkish\r\nattitude can hardly be considered constructive, positive or\r\nconciliatory. The repeated bellicose statements by\r\nMr. Bulent Ecevit, Deputy Prime Minister, in the past few\r\nmonths, clearly illustrate the contrary. Nor can the\r\nstatement by the former Turkish Prime Minister,\r\nMr. Mesut Yilmaz, that “international law does not apply\r\nin the case of the Aegean”.\r\nTurkey has constantly rejected the realistic approach\r\noffered by successive Greek Governments after 1976 and\r\nup to 1995 by undermining all our efforts and proposals\r\nfor the improvement and normalization of our relations.\r\nThe bottom line in Greek-Turkish relations is really\r\nvery simple, as far as Greece is concerned. On our side,\r\nwe have no claims or designs of any kind against Turkey.\r\nWe have no demands of Turkey other than good-\r\nneighbourly relations based on respect for the principles\r\nof international law and treaties. We hope that Turkey\r\nwill respond to this and channel its behaviour into\r\naccepted norms of conduct between neighbouring States.\r\nSuch an attitude would have made the present exchange\r\ntotally unnecessary.\r\nThrough our Madrid joint statement, by which we\r\nstand, it has been put to our neighbour to respect the\r\nexisting overall framework of international law and\r\ntreaties that has defined our borders and relations and has\r\nstood unchallenged for the last 70 years, and to desist\r\nfrom aggressive policies, refrain from territorial claims\r\nand submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of\r\nJustice any argument it might deem valid concerning the\r\nislet of Imia.\r\nWe call again upon Turkey to submit to the general\r\njurisdiction of the Court, as Greece has done, and to\r\nfollow our realistic approach for clearing up the issues\r\nthat shadow our relations, within the spirit prescribed by\r\nour Madrid statement.\r\nMr. Osman (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic): In\r\nhis statement today before this Assembly, the\r\nrepresentative of the Eritrean regime made certain naive\r\nand absurd accusations against my country, and I take the\r\nfloor in order to exercise my right of reply.\r\nAt the outset I would like to make it clear that the\r\ntarget of this response is the Eritrean regime, which is\r\nimmature, and not, in any case, the brotherly, gracious\r\npeople of Eritrea, which has bonds of history, blood and\r\ncommon destiny with the people of the Sudan.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to emphasize that\r\nwe have the greatest respect for the people of Eritrea, but\r\nthe Eritrean regime is an instrument for destruction,\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nmurder and subversion in our region. Its policies are\r\ndirected by a tyrant and an ingrate dictator, well known to\r\nthe people of Eritrea and to the people of the Sudan as\r\nwell. He shared the livelihood of the people of the Sudan\r\nin his darkest moments during the more than 20 years that\r\nhe lived in the Sudan.\r\nUnlike all the other neighbours of the Sudan who have\r\nspoken before this Assembly in support of the peace efforts\r\nunder way in the Sudan, the last of whom was the Foreign\r\nMinister of Kenya, who only a few minutes ago and\r\nunderscored the commitment of the Government of the\r\nSudan to peace, only the representative of the Eritrean\r\nregime spoke of bad relations between the Sudan and its\r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nThe attempt by the Eritrean regime to attack my\r\ncountry is a crude way of obscuring the miserable and\r\nsevere living conditions of the fraternal Eritrean people\r\nsince the People’s Front took control in that country. The\r\nrepresentative of Eritrea spoke about issues that are an\r\ninvention of his own sick imagination which is attracted by\r\nmurder and destruction — a sick mind which is unable to\r\ncomprehend bare facts. The Sudan, which hosted the head\r\nof the Eritrean regime for over 20 years — longer than he\r\nhas lived in his own country — has a heritage, tradition,\r\nand morality which prevent it from pursuing policies of\r\nterrorism and the targeting of others.\r\nIt is common knowledge that many elements of the\r\nEritrean leadership have been liquidated by the Eritrean\r\nregime. The President of the Eritrean regime knows better\r\nthan anyone that the lists are quite long and are well known\r\nto the Eritrean people, in addition to that regime’s terrorist\r\nadventures. Indeed, the regime’s adventures have spread\r\neven in the past few months, beyond Eritrea’s borders.\r\nThus, the regime has liquidated elements opposed to it in\r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nThe Eritrean regime, which arrogated to itself the right\r\nto make false accusations against the Sudan, should instead\r\nhave addressed the miseries it has brought upon the\r\nEritrean people by its foolish policies. Those policies\r\nresulted in preventing hundreds of thousands of Eritrean\r\nrefugees who are hosted by the Sudan from returning home;\r\nselectivity has become the hallmark of Eritrean policy\r\nregarding the return of refugees. This is a gross violation of\r\nall international norms that guarantee the basic and\r\nhumanitarian rights of refugees.\r\nExamples of the arbitrariness and intransigence of the\r\nEritrean regime abound. We cite here the announcement by\r\nthe Eritrean president at a forum in Asmara that the\r\nEritrean army is in a state of war with the Sudan and that\r\ntheir objective is to bring down the Sudanese\r\nGovernment. He also said that the Eritrean regime’s\r\nsupport for the Sudanese opposition to achieve this goal\r\nis without limits. When the Agence France Presse\r\ncorrespondent, Ruth Simon, reported that announcement\r\nshe was arrested and detained by the Eritrean regime.\r\nThese facts show the extent of the threat posed by the\r\nEritrean President to international and regional peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Eritrean regime flouted international treaties\r\nwhen it took the step, unprecedented in the history of\r\ninternational relations, of handing over the premises of\r\nthe Sudanese Embassy to armed Sudanese opposition\r\nmovements which are supported by the Eritrean regime.\r\nIt also encouraged terrorists and hijackers by refusing to\r\nextradite those who hijacked a Sudanese civil aircraft and\r\ntreating them as heroes — an action that was also in\r\nviolation of international treaties.\r\nDoes the representative of a regime that declares war\r\nagainst a neighbouring State and publicly threatens to\r\nbring down its Government have the right to be among us\r\nas a Member of an international Organization whose first\r\nobjective is to promote world peace and security? Does\r\nthe representative of a regime that has accused this\r\ninternational Organization, as he did in his statement\r\ntoday, of betraying his country have the right to talk\r\nabout peace in the Sudan?\r\nThe clearest answer is provided by the fact that this\r\nregime expelled from its territory the personnel of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, thereby insulting them. That is yet another clear\r\nexample of how the Eritrean regime does not respect\r\ninternational treaties and laws which regulate asylum and\r\nthe status of refugees. The adventures of the Eritrean\r\nregime and its dictator President, which demonstrate lack\r\nof maturity and responsibility, are not secrets to be\r\ndivulged. Their actions are but a noisy coverup for\r\ninvading neighbouring countries, violating their territorial\r\nintegrity, sovereignty and territorial waters. Such acts\r\nshow no respect for other African States, deriding them\r\non their soil, as was done when Eritrea attended a\r\nmeeting of the Organization of African Unity for the first\r\ntime as an independent State.\r\nIn conclusion, we do not intend to waste the\r\nAssembly’s time by responding to the attacks of the\r\nirresponsible Eritrean regime. We do not wish to\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nencumber the time of this session devoted to the reform of\r\nthe Organization. However, we have been forced to respond\r\nby the false accusations made by the representative of the\r\nEritrean regime, which does not appreciate the value of the\r\ninternational Organization and its reform. We would like to\r\nunderscore the fact that the whole world is well aware of\r\nthe burdens shouldered by the Sudan for over 30 years in\r\nsupport of the cause of the Eritrean people. We are not\r\nboasting of this to the people of Eritrea because we owed\r\nthese efforts to them but we want to emphasize here the\r\ninferiority complexes which grip the sick mind of the\r\nleadership of the Eritrean regime, which displayed a sense\r\nof ingratitude by invading the territory of the Sudan,\r\nassaulting it with tanks, and planting landmines inside our\r\nterritory, thus terrorizing innocent citizens. These are the\r\ncitizens who hosted that regime and shared with it their\r\nresources for over three decades.\r\nThe President: I would like to remind members that\r\nthe time limit for the second intervention is five minutes.\r\nThis applies to the next speaker, the representative of\r\nTurkey.\r\nMr. Tanç (Turkey): The response of the representative\r\nof Greece to the questions in my statement in right of reply\r\ndid not provide any answers clarifying the position of\r\nGreece with regard to international law or to Greece’s\r\nselective approach to its implementation. Greece does not\r\nseem to be ready to explain its double standards with\r\nrespect to its national airspace and sea space in the Aegean,\r\nto the demilitarized status of the eastern Aegean islands or,\r\nfinally, to the modalities of resolving the existing territorial\r\ndisputes in the Aegean Sea.\r\nWe asked how Greece could explain its militarization\r\nof the eastern Aegean islands in violation of international\r\ntreaties, and the inconsistency in claiming different airspace\r\nand sea space in contravention of the relevant Chicago\r\nConvention.\r\nThe representative of Greece also referred to Turkey’s\r\nterritorial claims on Greece. We would like to stress that in\r\neach and every case at issue between Turkey and Greece it\r\ncan easily be seen that it is a Greek claim to which Turkey\r\nhas responded. In this respect, I would like to refer to the\r\nprogramme of the former Greek Government which\r\nestablishes a zone of areas of Greek domination, including\r\nnorthern Epir, Macedonia, Thrace, the Aegean region of\r\nTurkey, the eastern Mediterranean and Cyprus. It is these\r\nexpansionist policies to which Turkey has been forced to\r\nrespond.\r\nIn a letter addressed to the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations in 1995 we asked whether Greece was\r\nready to announce that it did not harbour any territorial\r\nambitions with regard to the “lost homelands” to which\r\nthey refer in their programme. I am happy to hear that\r\nthere is movement in that direction.\r\nWith regard to the statement of the Greek Foreign\r\nMinister claiming that Greece has 3,000 islands in the\r\nAegean, Greece should remember that in the Aegean only\r\nthe islands to which sovereignty was explicitly transferred\r\nby international treaties belong to Greece. The Aegean\r\nSea as a whole has never belonged to Greece. There are\r\ntwo countries — Turkey and Greece — on the two sides\r\nof that Sea. When one country threatens to extend its\r\nterritorial seas up to 12 miles, in effect wanting to acquire\r\n70 per cent of that Sea and cutting off the lifeline of the\r\nother coastal State to international waters, it is an\r\ninfringement of the rights of that coastal State. Greece’s\r\nrights in the Aegean end where Turkey’s rights begin. It\r\nis not Turkey which is advancing any claims in the\r\nAegean Sea; it is only responding to the threat that\r\nGreece is advancing to extend its waters up to 12 miles,\r\nthereby cutting off international waters to Turkey.\r\nThe misrepresentation of facts on the Greek side is\r\nmost striking and alarming when it comes to the issue of\r\nCyprus, which also took up a large part of the statement\r\nof the Greek Foreign Minister. Greece would like third\r\nparties to believe that the question of Cyprus began in\r\n1974, when in response to the Greek attempt to annex the\r\nisland to Greece, Turkey, on the basis of the 1960 Treaty\r\nof Guarantee, exercised its right to intervene to prevent\r\nGreece’s annexation of Cyprus. If the Cyprus issue began\r\nin 1974, how can Greece explain why the United Nations\r\nPeacekeeping Force in Cyprus was deployed in the island\r\nin 1964, 33 years ago and 10 years before Turkey was\r\nforced to intervene in order to protect the Turkish\r\nCypriots from Greek Cypriot aggression?\r\nI need only quote from Archbishop Makarios, the\r\nGreek Cypriot leader, who spoke in the Security Council\r\non 19 July, immediately following the Greek coup. It is\r\na long statement, elaborating on the invasion by Greece,\r\nand so as not to take up the time of the Assembly I am\r\ngoing to read only one of the last sentences of the\r\nstatement. Archbishop Makarios said:\r\n“The coup of the Greek junta is an invasion, and\r\nfrom its consequences the whole people of Cyprus\r\nsuffers, both Greeks and Turks.” [S/PV.1780, para.\r\n32]\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that no progress in\r\nCyprus can be achieved by mixing priorities. The objective\r\nshould be first to find a just solution to the Cyprus\r\nproblem, and not to create faits accomplis. In Cyprus the\r\nimportant requirement is to base a solution on realities. It\r\nis necessary to be sincere, realistic, constructive and\r\ncreative, and not to confuse wishful thinking with the facts.\r\nMr. Sarris (Greece): What the Deputy Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Turkey has just said is a repetition of\r\nwhat he said last year on this issue. I do not intend to reply\r\nagain to statements made last year.\r\nI would merely add this: It is Turkey, not Greece, that\r\nconsistently undermines international law and the United\r\nNations Charter by flagrantly violating their most\r\nfundamental principles — that is, by its application of a\r\ntraditional foreign policy of aggression, invasion and\r\nmilitary occupation towards neighbouring countries; by its\r\ncustom of threatening the use of force and war; by its\r\ncontinuous promotion of territorial and other expansionist\r\nclaims; and last, but not least, by its complete disregard for\r\nits international commitments with regard to respect for\r\nhuman rights, including minority rights.\r\nAnd now Turkey insults the General Assembly —\r\nthereby adding insult to injury — by insisting on distorting\r\nthe truth through the same false and unsubstantiated\r\nallegations. I do not consider these allegations worthy of\r\nfurther discussion in this body.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): In the 23 years of Turkish\r\ninvasion and occupation of Cyprus, Turkey has been\r\nconsistently attempting either to eclipse itself from the\r\nscene of the crime of aggression or to cloud the issues of\r\nwhat is known as the “Question of Cyprus”.\r\nThe representative of Greece very aptly described\r\nTurkey’s behaviour as double talk and distortion. I agree\r\nwith him.\r\nEven though differences exist between the Greek\r\nCypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities, especially\r\nfrom the constitutional standpoint, the gist of the problem\r\nis not these intercommunal differences but Turkey’s act of\r\naggression and continuing occupation of 37 per cent of the\r\nterritory of Cyprus, the uprooting of 200,000 people from\r\ntheir ancestral homes and lands, the importation of settlers\r\nfrom mainland Turkey into Cyprus so as to change the\r\ndemographic structure of the island, and the ongoing gross\r\nviolation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of all\r\nCypriots — Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike.\r\nThe problem is not about defence expenditures,\r\ndespite what we have just heard, or about the right of\r\nself-defence. After all, under Article 51 of the Charter,\r\nStates are given the right — indeed they have the duty —\r\nof self-defence.\r\nNor is the problem of Cyprus its Government’s\r\napplication to join the European Union. As we have stated\r\nbefore, Cyprus is neither a colony nor a province of\r\nTurkey. It is ludicrous for Turkey to assume it can decide\r\nwho will and who will not apply for membership in the\r\nEuropean Union. And yet, under this ridiculous pretext,\r\nTurkey declared the integration and annexation of the\r\noccupied part of Cyprus to mainland Turkey — evidence\r\nof Ankara’s erratic foreign policy, as it was described in\r\nthe Wall Street Journal.\r\nAs I have stated, the grave issue facing the United\r\nNations and the Assembly is the Turkish act of aggression\r\ncompounded by the non-implementation and outright\r\ncontentious disregarding of solemn Security Council and\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions and decisions. These\r\nresolutions demand the withdrawal of the occupation\r\ntroops, the return of the refugees to their homes and\r\nlands, and respect for the human rights of all Cypriots.\r\nIronically, Turkey voted in favour of the\r\nunanimously adopted General Assembly resolution 3212\r\n(XXIX), which was endorsed by Security Council\r\nresolution 365 (1974), and thus rendered mandatory.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 37/253 again demands\r\nthe withdrawal of all occupation troops, affirms the right\r\nand the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the\r\nwhole of its territory, and calls on Member States to\r\nassist the Republic to exercise these rights. In order to\r\nfrustrate the implementation of the provisions of this\r\nresolution and to disappear from the scene of the crime,\r\nTurkey purported to establish an entity in the occupied\r\nareas of Cyprus; it did that as a shield against world\r\ncondemnation. This entity was declared legally invalid by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 541 (1983), which demands\r\nTurkey’s withdrawal and calls on the international\r\ncommunity not to recognize or in any way to assist this\r\nsecessionist entity. The provisions of Security Council\r\nresolution 541 (1983) were reaffirmed by Security\r\nCouncil resolution 550 (1984) and reiterated in many\r\nsubsequent resolutions.\r\nFor the Turkish representative to speak about treaties\r\nand to claim that Turkey has followed the provisions of\r\nthe Treaty of Guarantee is absolutely unacceptable in the\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nlight of the fact that this very Assembly described the\r\npresence of the troops there as occupation troops and asked\r\nfor their withdrawal.\r\nThe reason for the lack of progress in finding a\r\nsolution to the problem of Cyprus in accordance with the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General in 1994 is the lack of\r\npolitical will on the part of Turkey, which is evidenced by\r\nits refusal to withdraw its troops from Cyprus. General\r\nAssembly resolution 37/253 very accurately states that the\r\nwithdrawal of the occupation forces from the Republic of\r\nCyprus is an essential basis for a speedy and mutually\r\nacceptable solution to the problem of Cyprus.\r\nThe Treaty of Guarantee could not have given Turkey\r\nthe right to use military force because that would have been\r\ncontrary to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter — and the\r\ndemands of the Charter are superior to any treaty.\r\nThe President: The general debate at the fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly has come to an end.\r\nBefore declaring it closed, I would like to make some\r\nconcluding remarks. This is not a summary of the debate\r\nsince it is neither my task nor my responsibility to do that.\r\nIt is my conviction that the General Assembly debate\r\nhas proved once again the unique and important role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly within our Organization. In the course of\r\nthe general debate the major global issues facing the world\r\ncommunity today were addressed at the highest political\r\nlevel. We had the privilege of hearing statements by 176\r\nspeakers. Among them were 18 Heads of State, one Crown\r\nPrince, 14 Prime Ministers, 16 Deputy Prime Ministers and\r\nForeign Ministers, 111 Ministers for Foreign Affairs, four\r\nother Ministers, and 12 Heads of Delegations.\r\nProviding statistics at the end of the general debate has\r\nbecome a long-standing tradition, but I would urge us not\r\nto dismiss those numbers as mere “facts for the record”,\r\nbut, instead, to look at them as vivid testimony to the\r\nuniversal character of our Organization. And as for those\r\ncritics who tend to view the general debate as simply an\r\noccasion for generalized statements, I think the past two\r\nweeks have shown Member States engaged in an eloquent,\r\nvigorous, focused and thought-provoking discussion on\r\nissues of global significance.\r\nCan we do even better? No question about it, and it is\r\ntherefore not surprising that many speakers emphasized the\r\nneed to strengthen the role of the General Assembly and to\r\nstreamline its procedures. We should spare no effort to\r\nmake sure that the General Assembly, as a unique world\r\nparliament, conducts its business in the most efficient,\r\npragmatic and productive manner. Now, in that context,\r\nthe general debate performs many important functions and\r\none of the key ones among them, I think, is that of an\r\naccurate barometer of world opinion, especially as it\r\npertains to the United Nations. If we look at the past 12\r\ndays from that angle, I believe we would be justified in\r\nconcluding that the barometer is pointing towards “good\r\nweather”.\r\nWe all recall, however, that only a couple of years\r\nago — ironically on the eve of the Organization’s golden\r\nanniversary — there were ominous clouds of\r\ndisappointment and disillusionment on the horizon. As the\r\nOrganization came under a barrage of harsh and often\r\ndestructive criticism from different quarters, there was a\r\nsense of uncertainty and doubt about the Organization’s\r\nability to change and to adapt itself to a post-cold-war\r\nworld. True, there was no shortage of appeals for reform;\r\nbut, in the absence of a realistic blueprint, the gap\r\nbetween exhortations and practical deeds seemed to be\r\nhard to bridge.\r\nAfter listening carefully to the statements during the\r\ndebate, I am convinced that the discussion has reflected\r\na major change in perceptions and attitudes. I think that\r\non the issue of reform we have made a crucial step from\r\nthe quicksands of the doubtful to the firm grounds of the\r\npossible.\r\nVirtually every speaker addressed the issue of reform\r\nand commented on the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/51/950), which contains a concrete programme for\r\nrenewing the United Nations. It was one of the major\r\nthemes during the general debate. In this respect, it would\r\nbe fair to state that the efforts undertaken by the\r\nSecretary-General to reform the United Nations has\r\nobtained strong political support. Practically all\r\ndelegations welcomed the comprehensive reform package\r\nof the Secretary-General and most supported its\r\nendorsement in principle.\r\nDelegations emphasized the comprehensive nature of\r\nthe reform package. There was also a broad focus on the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to transform the leadership\r\nand management structure of the Organization. It was\r\nrecognized that we need to ensure that reform is\r\nundertaken as a concerted effort to redesign and\r\nstrengthen this Organization for the task it would be\r\nexpected to perform in the period ahead, rather than\r\nmerely as a cost-cutting exercise. At the same time, a\r\nnumber of speakers referred to the fact that certain reform\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nproposals would require further consideration. The\r\nimportance of reflecting the needs and aspirations of all\r\nMember States was stressed, as was the need for consensus\r\nand full participation.\r\nThe focus placed by Member States on the question of\r\nUnited Nations reform during the general debate, both in a\r\ngeneral and in a detailed fashion, emphasizes that\r\ndelegations recognized the need for expeditious action on\r\nthe issue. This debate has made it clear that Member States\r\nwant to move rapidly to provide the Secretary-General with\r\nthe mandate and the direction he requires to move ahead\r\nwith his reform programme.\r\nIt is very important not to lose the momentum and to\r\ntranslate the high level of political will and commitment\r\ndemonstrated during the general debate in favour of the\r\nproposed programme of reform into prompt concrete\r\nactions by the General Assembly.\r\nThere is a clear awareness of the critical moment the\r\nUnited Nations has reached. We can succeed in our joint\r\nefforts to build up a more effective and more viable\r\nOrganization and to make it better prepared for the new\r\nmillennium. To attain this goal, we should be guided by\r\nreason, tolerance and determination.\r\nThe reform process of the United Nations will be\r\nincomplete if it does not embrace the Security Council. The\r\ngeneral debate has reaffirmed the broad agreement that the\r\nreform of this organ is of great importance for its\r\nfunctioning and legitimacy. In this respect, views were\r\nfocused on the enlargement of the membership of the\r\nCouncil, taking into account equitable representation, new\r\nrealities and the interests of various regions. It was also felt\r\nby many that there is a need to democratize the Security\r\nCouncil and to increase the transparency of its procedures\r\nand working methods.\r\nThere is also a broad understanding that the reform of\r\nthe Security Council is a key issue for the United Nations\r\nthat demands a well thought out and well-balanced\r\ndecision.\r\nThe urgent need to put the United Nations on a sound\r\nfinancial footing has been identified by Member States as\r\na prerequisite for the successful reform and functioning of\r\nthe Organization. The theme of continuing financial\r\ndifficulties facing the United Nations was a clear\r\npessimistic undertone in the general debate. I have noted\r\nstrong appeals to those who are in arrears to fulfil their\r\nlegal obligations and to pay outstanding dues to the\r\nOrganization. At the same time, it was pointed out that\r\nthe time has come to adopt a new scale of assessments,\r\nbased on agreed principles, which would reflect the\r\ncapacity of Member States to pay. The reform process\r\nwill be substantially facilitated if we reach a consensus\r\ndecision on this very important issue this year.\r\nIt is very important that at this period of renewal and\r\nchange, the United Nations received the full confidence\r\nof Member States during the general debate, which\r\nreaffirmed its essential goals: maintaining international\r\npeace and security, enhancing cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, strengthening the role of international law,\r\npromoting and encouraging respect for human rights, and\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe general debate has demonstrated that the\r\ninternational community continues to concentrate its\r\nefforts on the resolution of the most acute problems\r\nfacing humankind. The concern of the Member States\r\nremained focused on areas of instability. The conflicts in\r\nthe Middle East and in the Great Lakes region of Africa,\r\nin Central Asia and in the Balkans were particularly\r\ndisturbing. The internationalization of problems such as\r\nterrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering and\r\ncorruption, illicit arms trading and environmental\r\npollution was also placed at the centre of the debate.\r\nThe debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate\r\nresponse to these and other issues is to be delivered\r\nthrough a continuing process of negotiations; a resolute\r\npolicy of disarmament, both of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and of conventional weapons; the promotion\r\nof sustainable development; the further strengthening of\r\nhuman rights machinery; and the gradual reorientation of\r\nthe United Nations peacekeeping activities toward\r\npreventive diplomacy.\r\nIn the political area, a clear trend has emerged\r\ntowards focusing on prevention rather than on\r\npeacemaking and peace enforcement. The emphasis was\r\nput on the preventive presence of troops or their rapid\r\ndeployment to avoid an escalation of hostilities as well as\r\non post-conflict peace-building as a way of preventing the\r\nrecurrence of crises in the future.\r\nThe promotion of economic and social progress, the\r\neradication of poverty, ways to ensure the widest possible\r\nparticipation in an expanding world economy, and\r\nregional integration and cooperation justifiably occupied\r\na predominant place in the general debate.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 28th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 7 October 1997\r\nIt was clearly stressed that the process of\r\nglobalization, which is now bringing both opportunities and\r\ndangers to Member States, should lead to an increasingly\r\nintegrated approach to development and benefit all nations.\r\nThe barriers that are still maintained in order to hamper\r\naccess to foreign markets and the discriminatory and\r\nprotectionist practices in international trade must be\r\neliminated in order to bring a vision of global free trade to\r\nreality.\r\nAchieving sustained growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment must remain a major global objective. There\r\nare persistent problems, such as lack of safe water, threats\r\nto biological diversity, ozone loss, global warming,\r\ndeclining land productivity and desertification. Sustained\r\ngrowth is essential to the economic and social development\r\nof all countries. Its promotion will improve the standards of\r\nliving through the eradication of poverty, hunger and\r\nilliteracy.\r\nThe general debate has also witnessed support for\r\nencouraging human rights, democratization and good\r\ngovernance, as well as the advancement of women and\r\nprotection of the rights of children and persons belonging\r\nto minorities. The need to strengthen the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations in these fields has been stressed by many\r\nspeakers. It is therefore our responsibility to protect the\r\nphilosophy of the Charter of the United Nations and further\r\ndevelop the role of this Organization in the economic and\r\nsocial spheres.\r\nIt is also our responsibility not to lose the spirit of\r\ncooperation and commitment at the high political level that\r\nhas been demonstrated in the general debate. We should\r\ndirect our future work in the plenary and the Main\r\nCommittees in such a way as to embody them in the\r\ndecision-making process. At present, this Organization\r\ndepends to a decisive extent on what we are saying or\r\ndoing. It is in our hands to agree on what kind of United\r\nNations we wish to have in the future.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank the\r\nrepresentatives of all Member States who participated in\r\nthe general debate for their cooperation and support of\r\nthis presidency. This cooperation allowed us to begin\r\nplenary meetings punctually and to conclude the general\r\ndebate on time. We managed to achieve the maximum\r\nuse of conference-servicing facilities as well as national\r\nsavings for this Organization, a goal to which we must\r\ncontinually subscribe. I will continue to count on\r\nMembers’ cooperation for the remainder of the session so\r\nthat we may be able to conclude our work at the\r\nprescribed time.\r\nI am also pleased to indicate that, during the past\r\nthree weeks, I have noticed that more women delegates\r\nhave been participating in our deliberations. This has\r\ngiven a more gender-balanced representation to our\r\nmeetings.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 9?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAnnouncement\r\nThe President: I should like to inform\r\nrepresentatives that, in connection with agenda item 157,\r\nentitled “United Nations reform: measures and proposals”,\r\nan informal list of measures and proposals summarizing\r\nthe principal actions and recommendations contained in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General has been prepared by\r\nthe Secretariat. This informal list is available in English\r\nonly and has just been distributed in the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nI would like again to emphasize that this is an\r\ninformal document and therefore is available in English\r\nonly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
