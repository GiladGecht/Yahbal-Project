(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3:25 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 120 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/52/350/Add.3)\r\nThe President: In a letter contained in document\r\nA/52/350/Add.3, the Secretary-General informs the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly that, since the issuance\r\nof his communications dated 16 and 29 September and 6\r\nOctober 1997, Equatorial Guinea has made the necessary\r\npayment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in\r\nArticle 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 157\r\nUnited Nations reform: measures and proposals:\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/51/950)\r\nConference room papers (A/52/CRP.1 and 2)\r\nThe President: May I draw the attention of delegates\r\nto the fact that, on the recommendation of the General\r\nCommittee, the General Assembly decided to consider\r\nagenda item 157 directly in plenary meeting.\r\nIn connection with this item, members will recall\r\nthat the report of the Secretary-General entitled\r\n“Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for\r\nReform” has been issued as document A/51/950.\r\nThe Assembly also has before it two conference\r\nroom papers prepared by the Secretariat: A/52/CRP.1,\r\nentitled “Establishment of the post of Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral”, and A/52/CRP.2, entitled “Rationalization of the\r\nsubsidiary machinery of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil”.\r\nI should like to recall that an informal list of\r\nmeasures and proposals summarizing the principal actions\r\nand recommendations contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, also prepared by the Secretariat, was\r\nmade available yesterday and is being distributed today in\r\nthis Conference Room. Therefore, we have three\r\nadditional documents prepared by the Secretariat.\r\nDuring the past three weeks, I have carried out\r\nextensive consultations on the procedure to be followed\r\nto consider the reform proposals submitted by the\r\nSecretary-General. It is my understanding that the\r\nproposal to consider the item on United Nations reform at\r\ninformal meetings reflects the preference of the members\r\nof the General Assembly. I therefore suggest that, under\r\nthe chairmanship of the President, and with the assistance\r\nof the Vice-Presidents, open-ended informal consultations\r\nof the plenary should be held to facilitate the\r\nconsideration of the reform proposals.\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 8 October 1997\r\nIn the absence of any objection, may I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to continue its consideration of\r\nagenda item 157 in open-ended informal consultations of\r\nthe plenary?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to further propose that,\r\nin order to proceed expeditiously with the consideration of\r\nthis item, the first meeting of the open-ended informal\r\nconsultations of the plenary be held in this room\r\nimmediately after the adjournment of this meeting.\r\nI see no objection. We shall therefore proceed\r\naccordingly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3:30 p.m.\r\n2\r\n"
