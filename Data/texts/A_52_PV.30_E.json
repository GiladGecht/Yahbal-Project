(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 120 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/52/350/Add.4)\r\nThe President: In a letter contained in document\r\nA/52/350/Add.4, the Secretary-General informs the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly that, since the issuance\r\nof his communications dated 16 and 29 September and 6\r\nand 8 October 1997, Dominica has made the necessary\r\npayment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in\r\nArticle 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council\r\nThe President: This morning the General Assembly\r\nwill proceed to the election of five non-permanent members\r\nof the Security Council to replace those members whose\r\nterm of office expires on 31 December 1997.\r\nThe five non-permanent outgoing members are the\r\nfollowing: Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the\r\nRepublic of Korea. These five States cannot be re-elected\r\nand therefore their names should not appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the\r\nSecurity Council will include in 1998 the following\r\nStates: Costa Rica, Japan, Kenya, Portugal and Sweden.\r\nThe names of those States, therefore, should also not\r\nappear on the ballot papers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members which will\r\nremain in office in 1998, two are from Africa and Asia,\r\none is from Latin America and the Caribbean and two are\r\nfrom Western European and other States.\r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December\r\n1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected\r\naccording to the following pattern: three from Africa and\r\nAsia, one from Eastern Europe and one from Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. The ballot papers reflect this\r\npattern.\r\nIn accordance with established practice, there is an\r\nunderstanding to the effect that, of the three States to be\r\nelected from Africa and Asia, two should be from Africa\r\nand one from Asia.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the\r\nnumber of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats\r\nGeneral Assembly 30th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 14 October 1997\r\nto be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a\r\ntwo-thirds majority of those present and voting will be\r\ndeclared elected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there\r\nwill be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which\r\nhave obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that\r\nprocedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret\r\nballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed by the\r\nChairmen of the respective regional groups that for the\r\nthree vacant seats from among the African and Asian States\r\nthere are three endorsed candidates, namely, Bahrain,\r\nGabon and the Gambia.\r\nFrom among the Eastern European States, there are\r\ntwo candidates for one vacant seat. The candidates are\r\nSlovenia and The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nAs for the Latin American and Caribbean States,\r\nBrazil is the endorsed candidate for one vacant seat.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nwe shall proceed now to the election by secret ballot.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed and to write on them the\r\nnames of the five States for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will\r\nbe declared invalid. Names of Member States on a ballot\r\npaper which do not belong to that region will not be\r\ncounted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Mmualefe\r\n(Botswana), Miss Gordon (Jamaica) and Mr. Hussin\r\n(Malaysia) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10:40 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11:25 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African and Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 174\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 174\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of Members voting: 174\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 116\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBahrain 172\r\nGabon 171\r\nGambia 169\r\nZambia 1\r\nGroup B — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 174\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 174\r\nAbstentions: 4\r\nNumbers of Members voting: 170\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 114\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSlovenia 140\r\nThe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 30\r\nGroup C — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 174\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 174\r\nAbstentions: 6\r\nNumbers of Members voting: 168\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 112\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBrazil 167\r\nArgentina 1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nthe following States were elected members of the\r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning 1\r\nJanuary 1998: Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, the Gambia\r\nand Slovenia.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States which have\r\nbeen elected members of the Security Council.
