The Fifth\r\nCommittee adopted the draft resolution without a vote.\r\nThe President: If there is no proposal under rule 66\r\nof the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General\r\nAssembly decides not to discuss the report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee which is before the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Statements will therefore be limited\r\nto explanations of vote. The positions of delegations\r\nregarding the recommendation of the Fifth Committee\r\nhave been made clear in the Committee and are reflected\r\nin the relevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered\r\nin a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a\r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote\r\nonly once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary\r\nmeeting, unless that delegation’s vote in plenary\r\nmeeting is different from its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I remind delegations that, also in accordance\r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that we\r\nare going to proceed to take a decision in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee.\r\nAgenda item 142\r\nAdministrative and budgetary aspects of the financing\r\nof the United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\n(a) Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 15 October 1997\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/52/453)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on the draft resolution recommended by the Fifth\r\nCommittee in paragraph 6 of its report.\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote.
