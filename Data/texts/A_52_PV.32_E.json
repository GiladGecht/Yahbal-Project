(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 46\r\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/305)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform the Assembly\r\nthat the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, on\r\nbehalf of the Western European and other States, in a letter\r\ndated 10 October 1997, requests that the General Assembly\r\nhear in plenary meeting a statement by the Observer of the\r\nHoly See during the debate on agenda item 46.\r\nMembers will recall that in accordance with the\r\nestablished practice of the General Assembly, observer non-\r\nMember States may normally make statements only in the\r\nMain Committees. However, following consultations, it is\r\nproposed that the General Assembly should take a decision\r\non that request.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the proposal\r\nto hear the Observer of the Holy See in the course of the\r\ndebate on agenda item 46?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Saguier Caballero (Paraguay) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): It is an honour for the delegation of\r\nParaguay, in its capacity as coordinator of the Rio Group,\r\nto make this statement on agenda item 46,\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development”.\r\nFirst of all, the Rio Group would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General and the relevant offices of the\r\nSecretariat for the report presented on this subject,\r\ncontained in document A/52/305, which will be of great\r\nuse in our work.\r\nThe States members of the Rio Group attribute\r\nparticular importance to the issue of social development\r\nin all its aspects and are totally committed to the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the\r\nProgramme of Action, as reflected in resolution 50/161 of\r\n22 December 1995.\r\nAt the eleventh summit of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Rio Group, held in Asunción,\r\nParaguay, in August this year, our leaders agreed that the\r\nelimination of extreme poverty, the achievement of social\r\njustice, the promotion of forms of citizen participation, as\r\nwell as the improvement of standards of living and the\r\ngeneral welfare of our peoples are permanent objectives\r\nfor our countries and can be more easily achieved through\r\ncooperation and coordination between democratic\r\nGovernments.\r\nThe Rio Group has demonstrated its commitment to\r\nthe outcome of the World Summit on Social Development\r\non several occasions and, more importantly, it has done\r\nso concretely and practically. In 1995, in response to a\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ncall by the Government of Argentina, the Rio Group\r\napproved the Buenos Aires Declaration on the follow-up to\r\nthe World Summit on Social Development, aimed at the\r\nregional implementation of the Copenhagen commitments.\r\nIn 1996, the Heads of State and Government of the\r\nGroup gathered in Cochabamba, Bolivia, where they\r\nreaffirmed their determination to overcome poverty,\r\nmalnutrition, marginalization, the lack of access to health\r\ncare and illiteracy, through policies that would lead to\r\nsustainable economic development in the medium and long\r\nterm. The participants at the Asunción summit this year\r\nalso reaffirmed their conviction that a sustained process of\r\neconomic and social development is fundamental for\r\ndemocratic stability and the improvement of standards of\r\nliving for people.\r\nIn addition, the countries of the Group took an active\r\npart in the First Regional Conference in Follow-up to the\r\nWorld Summit on Social Development, held in São Paulo\r\nin April 1997 by the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC). That Conference\r\napproved the São Paulo Consensus, whose commitments are\r\nduly reflected in the Secretary-General’s report. The Rio\r\nGroup here reiterates its support for the appeal made in the\r\nSão Paulo Consensus to hold meetings in other regions to\r\nevaluate the Social Summit, an appeal that was also\r\nwelcomed in Economic and Social Council resolution\r\n1997/56.\r\nIn addition, the Rio Group has followed with\r\nparticular interest the initiatives of both Governments and\r\ninstitutions to comply with the outcome of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit. We welcome, for example, the micro-credit\r\nsummit, a valuable initiative that covers an aspect that other\r\npolicies designed to fight poverty have not been able to\r\ndeal with effectively. The Rio Group also joins in the\r\napproval expressed by the Economic and Social Council of\r\nthe decision taken by the Interim Committee of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) to grant permanent\r\nstatus to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility\r\n(ESAF). We also share in the belief that there is a need to\r\nestablish necessary safeguards for social equality, a decisive\r\nfactor in the success of structural adjustment programmes.\r\nWith regard to the results of the thirty-fifth session of\r\nthe Commission for Social Development, the Rio Group\r\nattaches great importance to the multi-year programme of\r\nwork for the years 1997-2000, with “Follow-up to the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development” as its substantive\r\ntheme. The agreed conclusions on productive employment\r\nand sustainable livelihood, transmitted to the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, reflect the interest in continuing the\r\nsearch for policies that will permit the achievement of\r\ntotal employment.\r\nIn regard to future activities, the Rio Group will\r\nactively participate in the thirty-sixth session of the\r\nCommission for Social Development when promotion of\r\nthe social integration and participation of all people,\r\nincluding disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, is\r\ndiscussed.\r\nMoreover, the Group will make every effort to\r\nensure the success of the special session of the General\r\nAssembly in the year 2000 to carry out an overall review\r\nand appraisal of the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nSummit, and to consider further actions and initiatives. In\r\nthis regard, the preparatory process for the special session\r\nwill be of the utmost importance. The Rio Group hopes\r\nthat the preparatory committee of the whole of the\r\nAssembly will begin its work in 1998, pursuant to\r\nresolution 51/202.\r\nThe concept of social development places great\r\nresponsibilities on us which the member States of the Rio\r\nGroup will continue to shoulder with responsibility and\r\ndetermination at both the regional and national levels. At\r\nthe intergovernmental level, we will continue our efforts\r\nso that the work of the Organization may give effective\r\nguidance to Governments in their struggle to eradicate\r\npoverty and achieve complete human development.\r\nMr. Wolzfeld (Luxembourg) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union on the follow-up to the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia\r\nand Cyprus have aligned themselves with this statement.\r\nIt is two years since 117 Heads of State and\r\nGovernment meeting in Copenhagen adopted a\r\nDeclaration and a Programme of Action which marked a\r\nmajor advance in the international community’s\r\nperception of the development process by placing people\r\nat the centre of its concerns. The participants in the\r\nCopenhagen Summit committed themselves to pursuing as\r\nprime goals the eradication of poverty, the promotion of\r\nfull employment and the fostering of stable, safe and just\r\nsocieties.\r\nThe international community recognized at\r\nCopenhagen that no country, however rich, could remain\r\nunaffected by social problems. At the same time, it\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ndefined a new consensus on the question of development,\r\nwhose principal goal should be to benefit the individual;\r\ndevelopment policies should be aimed at that goal, with full\r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and, in\r\nparticular, equality between men and women.\r\nThe Heads of State and Government further agreed at\r\nCopenhagen to give the goals of social development and\r\nhuman well-being\r\n“the highest priority both now and into the twenty-first\r\ncentury” [Copenhagen Declaration on Social\r\nDevelopment, para. 12]\r\nand to define an integrated approach to social development\r\nat the world level.\r\nThrough the three-pronged approach adopted by the\r\nSummit, States committed themselves to pursuing the\r\nobjective of eradicating poverty in the world, promoting full\r\nemployment as a fundamental public-policy priority and\r\npromoting social integration by fostering stable, safe and\r\njust societies on the basis of respect for human rights, non-\r\ndiscrimination and the closest possible involvement of all\r\nin decisions affecting their well-being.\r\nThe Programme of Action identified full employment,\r\ncoupled with appropriate rewards, as an effective means of\r\ncombating poverty and promoting social integration. It is\r\nessential that job creation be at the heart of national\r\nstrategies and policies. Special attention should be given to\r\ndeveloping employment and to the need for providing\r\nquality jobs, with full respect for the rights of workers as\r\ndefined in the pertinent international instruments, in\r\nparticular, those agreed in the context of the International\r\nLabour Organization. In this connection, we welcome the\r\nagreed conclusions adopted at the latest meeting of the\r\nCommission for Social Development during its discussion\r\non productive employment and sustainable livelihoods,\r\nwhich should serve as a useful reference for national\r\nGovernments.\r\nUnemployment remains a matter of grave concern\r\nwithin the European Union. Although the conditions for\r\neconomic recovery in Europe exist, the level of\r\nunemployment is still far too high, and employment\r\ncontinues to be a priority issue for the European Union and\r\nits member States. The new European Union Treaty — the\r\nAmsterdam Treaty — reinforces the Union’s social\r\ndimension in following the agreements of the Summit for\r\nSocial Development. The new Title on Employment, the\r\ninclusion of the agreement on social policy in the Treaty\r\nand the further possibility of cooperation in the area of\r\nsocial exclusion recognize the importance and the\r\nuniversal dimension of social development and of\r\nimproving the human condition.\r\nThe Copenhagen Declaration acknowledges that the\r\nformulation and implementation of strategies, policies,\r\nprogrammes and actions for social development are the\r\nresponsibility of each State. Owing to the diversity of\r\nsituations across the world and the complexity and\r\ninterdependence of social development factors, universal\r\napplication of a uniform strategy is out of the question.\r\nYet Governments cannot invoke the need to take\r\naccount of each country’s specific situation in\r\nimplementing the most appropriate strategy as an excuse\r\nfor going back on commitments they freely entered into\r\nat the Social Summit and at international conferences.\r\nGovernments cannot rely on their achievements in one\r\narea in order to neglect other areas; they cannot point to\r\nlack of development in order to justify the denial of\r\nequality or the rights of persons belonging to minorities\r\nor native populations.\r\nDevelopment is not just about economic growth. The\r\nProgramme of Action proclaims that the ultimate aim of\r\nsocial development is to improve the quality of life for\r\nall. The achievement of that aim presupposes, among\r\nother things, the establishment of an open and democratic\r\nregime, with Governments being accountable to the\r\npeople for their actions and individuals having full access\r\nto decision-making at all levels. It presupposes increased\r\nopportunities — equal opportunities — for all, the rule of\r\nlaw and respect for diversity and for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, including the rights of persons\r\nbelonging to minorities. It equally implies social justice\r\nand an equitable distribution of income and wealth, along\r\nwith government action to enshrine the rights of the\r\nindividual in law and to ensure that such rights are\r\nrespected. These, and all other commitments must be\r\nimplemented in full.\r\nWe should like to reiterate here the importance we\r\nattach to participation. Such participation should extend to\r\nall, men and women, and especially to members of\r\nvulnerable groups, including the representatives of persons\r\nliving on the fringes of society, as well as the\r\nhandicapped, the young and the elderly. The aim of social\r\nintegration is to create a\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\n“ society for all\u0027, in which every individual ... has an\r\nactive role to play.” (Programme of Action of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, para. 66)\r\nMeasures to promote such integration should be tailored to\r\nthe emerging needs of the persons concerned and take\r\nadvantage of the development of new technologies.\r\nThe Copenhagen Summit acted as a catalyst in giving\r\na fresh boost to the drive for better integration of economic\r\nand social aspects in the development process. It recognized\r\nthat social development continued to be a national\r\nresponsibility, but at the same time stressed that the\r\nsupport, firm commitment and collective efforts of the\r\ninternational community were essential if the objectives\r\ndefined in Copenhagen were to be achieved.\r\nThe European Union is convinced that the\r\ninternational community must provide support both\r\nbilaterally and multilaterally, in particular for the least\r\ndeveloped countries, if it wishes to help create the\r\nnecessary conditions to enable Governments to take the\r\ninitiative in assessing poverty situations and formulating\r\nnational strategies and programmes to combat poverty and\r\nto promote social development. Poverty eradication and\r\nsocial development are essential aims of the cooperation\r\nbetween the European Union and the developing countries,\r\nas the Maastricht Treaty shows. The European Union has\r\ntherefore become seriously involved in the framework of\r\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment’s Development Assistance Committee,\r\nparticularly in the strategy entitled “The role of\r\ndevelopment cooperation at the dawn of the 21st century”.\r\nWe shall need to look closely at ways of effectively\r\nmobilizing financial resources, including those from private\r\nsources, to combat poverty and promote social\r\ndevelopment, and at ways of more effectively directing\r\ncooperation and development aid.\r\nThe European Union will endeavour to honour our\r\nundertaking to achieve the aim agreed by the United\r\nNations of setting aside 0.7 per cent of our gross national\r\nproduct for official development assistance as soon as\r\npossible. We encourage the other developed countries to\r\nfollow suit. In this regard, the present downturn in the\r\npercentage of gross national product allocated to official\r\ndevelopment assistance remains a matter of concern. We\r\nare prepared to step up efforts to reverse this trend, in view\r\nof the need to reinforce the quality and usefulness of\r\nofficial development assistance. All countries should attack\r\nthe root causes of this downturn in a spirit of global\r\ncooperation. Strategies should be developed to increase the\r\naid provided by donors for assistance programmes and\r\nrevive the undertakings which they reaffirmed at the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development. Some countries\r\nhave reached or even surpassed the agreed 0.7 per cent\r\ntarget.\r\nA new partnership should be based on the\r\nrecognition that development financing is a joint\r\nresponsibility and should be reflected in a fairer and more\r\nwidespread distribution of the burden. The quality and\r\nimpact of aid will need to be improved, in particular by\r\neliminating the fragmentation or duplication of effort. We\r\nalso note the work done by the countries concerned to\r\ndevelop the 20/20 formula, particularly at meetings which\r\nfollowed the adoption of the Oslo Consensus.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development, which\r\nenabled the international community to adopt a specific\r\ndevelopment perspective, was not an isolated event. The\r\nresults of earlier Conferences, particularly those held in\r\nRio, Vienna and Cairo, were taken into account when the\r\nfinal document was drawn up. The commitments entered\r\ninto in Beijing were themselves based on the outcome at\r\nCopenhagen. Governments as well as the United Nations\r\nsystem should therefore implement those results and\r\nensure an integrated follow-up to them.\r\nWe believe that the Economic and Social Council\r\nshould consider each year, under the relevant agenda item\r\nof the general segment, progress made between\r\nGovernments and organizations, as well as achievements\r\non the ground. The Council should also continue to\r\nharmonize and coordinate the work programmes of the\r\ntechnical committees responsible for following up major\r\nconferences. Finally, the President of the Council could\r\nconsult regularly with the chairmen of those committees\r\nin the presence and with the participation of\r\nrepresentatives from the Secretariat branches concerned.\r\nHere, the European Union welcomes the discussions\r\nheld on the subject at the Economic and Social Council’s\r\nmost recent substantive session. We consider that the\r\nresolutions which resulted show that definite progress has\r\nbeen made.\r\nTo ensure an integrated follow-up to the World\r\nSummit, a mechanism was set up to operate at three\r\nlevels, with input from the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment, the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, with the latter acting as principal\r\ndecision-making body on questions relating to the follow-\r\nup to the Copenhagen Summit. In this connection, we\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nrecall that, as mentioned in the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/52/305) the General Assembly’s Preparatory Committee\r\nof the Whole, which will be set up at the fifty-second\r\nsession, should meet after the annual session of the\r\nCommission for Social Development, since it was decided\r\nthat its core activities would be based on the information\r\nprovided by the Commission for Social Development and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\nWe should also like to reiterate the importance of\r\nensuring an integrated follow-up both in the framework of\r\nthe three-level mechanism and in the United Nations\r\noperational development activities.\r\nI should like to conclude with three points that are\r\ndeserving of our attention, with a view, particularly, to the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly in the year 2000\r\nfor the overall appraisal of the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the Summit, when social integration and the\r\nparticipation of all will be the watchwords.\r\nThe World Conference of Ministers responsible for\r\nYouth, which the Portuguese Government, in cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations, will be organizing in Lisbon from\r\n8 to 12 August 1998, will provide the platform for an\r\nassessment of the implementation of the World Programme\r\nof Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond at the\r\nnational, regional and local levels and for the preparation of\r\nnew proposals on how the Programme should be\r\nimplemented on the basis of a more effectively targeted\r\nintersectoral approach.\r\nWe welcome the decision taken at the last meeting of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council to renew Mr Lindqvist’s\r\nterm of office for a further period of three years, and we\r\nrecall the Council’s request to the Secretary-General to give\r\ngreater priority to activities concerning persons with\r\ndisabilities and to set aside the necessary resources to\r\nenable the Secretariat to perform its function as a focal\r\npoint.\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons, which will be\r\ncelebrated in 1999, will provide an opportunity to promote\r\nthe vision of a future “society for all ages” by, among other\r\nthings, encouraging the involvement of persons of all\r\ngenerations in the preparations for the Year. The European\r\nUnion is delighted to note that preparations for the Year are\r\nproceeding apace, with the participation of the elderly in\r\nparticular in the development and implementation of\r\nactivities at the national and local levels.\r\nMr. Jabir (United Republic of Tanzania): On behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China, I would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the report “Implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development”\r\n(A/52/305), and the report on poverty eradication\r\ncontained in document A/52/315. We also welcome the\r\nHuman Development Report 1997, which includes an\r\nanalysis of global poverty and provides suggestions on\r\nnew ways to measure and combat poverty.\r\nI wish at the outset to reaffirm our full commitment\r\nto the implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, contained in the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action.\r\nThere have been considerable efforts by the\r\ndeveloping countries to act on the specific areas of both\r\nthe Declaration and the Programme of Action, focusing,\r\ninter alia, on policy formulation, the elaboration of\r\nprogrammes and strategies, and the setting of time-bound\r\ntargets for poverty eradication. Particular attention has\r\nbeen paid to the needs of special groups, as well as to the\r\nparticipation of civil society. Similarly, mechanisms and\r\nfocal points have been established. While these initiatives\r\nare at different levels of implementation, according to the\r\npriorities and capabilities of individual countries, the fact\r\nremains that they need to be supported, strengthened, and\r\nsustained.\r\nAt the regional level, it is encouraging to note that\r\nthe Economic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC) organized the First Regional\r\nConference in Follow-up to the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment at São Paulo, Brazil, from 6 to 9 April\r\n1997. We welcome the Fifth Asian and Pacific Ministerial\r\nConference on Social Development, to be held in Manila\r\nfrom 5 to 11 November 1997, to review national progress\r\nachieved and regional actions taken in the implementation\r\nof the Agenda for Action on Social Development in the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP) region. We would also encourage other\r\nregional groups which have not yet convened similar\r\nforums to do so. In this regard, we request the\r\ninternational community to support such endeavours by\r\nproviding the necessary financial resources, including\r\nsupport in the implementation of the outcome of these\r\nmeetings.\r\nEradication of poverty remains a priority goal of all\r\ndeveloping countries. However, despite increased efforts\r\nto eradicate it, the total number of people living in\r\npoverty is increasing. The majority of the population of\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nthese countries continue to live in extreme poverty, unable\r\nto access basic human needs such as nutrition, health, water\r\nand sanitation, education, employment, housing and\r\nparticipation in cultural and social life.\r\nWe acknowledge the fact that high and productive\r\nlevels of employment are fundamental means of combating\r\npoverty, ensuring equity, meeting people’s aspirations for\r\nparticipation in economic and social life and enhancing\r\nsocial cohesion. However, we are concerned about the\r\nnegative impact of the globalization of the world economy\r\nand trade liberalization on social development, particularly\r\nin developing countries. The development efforts of\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular for the provision of\r\nessential social and economic services, are severely\r\nhampered by the inadequate flow of financial resources to\r\nthese countries. The burden of external debt continues to be\r\none of the major concerns of developing countries. The\r\nGroup of 77 and China urge the international community to\r\nwork for a durable solution to the debt problem of these\r\ncountries, particularly those of Africa and the least\r\ndeveloped countries. The other priority of our Group is the\r\nneed to evaluate the negative impact of structural\r\nadjustment programmes on economic and social\r\ndevelopment and to assist those adjusting countries in\r\ncreating conditions for economic growth, job creation,\r\npoverty eradication and social development.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China, while recognizing social\r\ndevelopment and the implementation of the Programme of\r\nAction of the World Summit for Social Development to be\r\nprimarily the responsibility of Governments, stresses that\r\nthe mobilization of resources, at both national and\r\ninternational levels, remains one of the major constraints to\r\ndeveloping countries. In this regard, I recall that in\r\nresolutions 50/161 and 51/202 the General Assembly\r\nrecognized that the implementation of the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and the Programme of Action in developing\r\ncountries would need additional financial resources and\r\nmore effective development assistance. The Group therefore\r\nreaffirms the urgent need to reverse the trend of decline in\r\nofficial development assistance, which remains the principal\r\nsource of development financing for most developing\r\ncountries. We urge the developed countries to fulfil the\r\nagreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product\r\nfor overall official development assistance as a matter of\r\npriority.\r\nWe recognize that micro-credit programmes are a key\r\nstrategy in promoting self-employment, income generation,\r\neradication of poverty, empowerment of people, particularly\r\nwomen, and enhancement of social integration through\r\nfacilitating access to credit for the poor. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the outcome of the micro-credit summit held in\r\nWashington, D.C., from 2 to 4 February 1997, which\r\nlaunched a global movement to reach 100 million of the\r\nworld’s poorest families, especially women, with credit\r\nfor self-employment and other financial services by the\r\nyear 2005. In order to reach that goal, we need to\r\nestablish new micro-lending institutions and/or strengthen\r\nexisting ones in order to facilitate the access to credit of\r\npeople living in poverty. We call upon all regional and\r\ninternational institutions, including the specialized\r\nagencies working to eradicate poverty, to come forward\r\nto help attain the goals of the micro-credit summit.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China reaffirm the importance\r\nof employment growth and the urgent need to ensure that\r\nit is placed at the centre of economic and social policy-\r\nmaking in conjunction with other important goals. We\r\nalso recognize the need for improvement in the design of\r\npolicies and programmes to enhance employment\r\nopportunities for groups with special needs — women,\r\nyouth, older persons and persons with disabilities — so as\r\nto combat their exclusion from the labour market. In this\r\nconnection, we emphasize the importance of\r\nmainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and\r\nprogrammes aimed at employment creation, as well as the\r\nneed to include gender impact analysis as a regular\r\nfeature in all stages of the overall policy-making process.\r\nIn the same vein, the Group recognizes the need to\r\neffectively address the challenge of modifying\r\nemployment policies, in order to ensure the increased\r\nparticipation of disabled persons in the labour market.\r\nWe also attach great importance to the\r\nimplementation of the World Programme of Action for\r\nYouth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, and call for the\r\nparticipation of all relevant organs and specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations and related international\r\norganizations to assist developing countries in their efforts\r\nto implement that Programme of Action. The Group\r\nwelcomes the holding of the World Conference of\r\nMinisters Responsible for Youth to be held in Lisbon,\r\nPortugal, from 8 to 12 August 1999, and requests the\r\nUnited Nations to facilitate the participation of developing\r\ncountries, particularly those from Africa and the least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nThe International Year of the Older Person in 1999\r\nwill provide the opportunity to shed a global spotlight on\r\nthe longevity revolution that will be one of the greatest\r\nchallenges our developing countries will have to face in\r\nthe next century. The world population is ageing\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ndramatically. A steady stream of 1 million persons a month\r\nnow cross the threshold of age 60, and 80 per cent of these\r\nare in developing countries. By the year 2025, the total\r\nnumber of persons aged 60 and above will be 1.2 billion —\r\nand 70 per cent of them will still be living in our\r\ndeveloping world. It was the recognition of this\r\ndemographic revolution and its implications for our\r\ndeveloping countries that led the Group of 77 and China to\r\nsubmit a draft resolution to the General Assembly, adopted\r\nas “Implementation of the International Plan of Action on\r\nAging”. This landmark resolution, adopted by consensus on\r\n29 November 1985, emphasized that older persons must be\r\nconsidered an important and necessary element in the\r\ndevelopment process at all levels within a given society.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China reaffirm the importance of\r\nthe Commission for Social Development, as the functional\r\nCommission of the Economic and Social Council with the\r\nresponsibility to follow up on the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, and in this regard looks forward to the thirty-\r\nsixth session of the Commission, which will be held in\r\nFebruary 1998, with the priority theme of “Promoting social\r\nintegration and participation of all people, including\r\ndisadvantaged and vulnerable groups and persons”.\r\nWe welcome the convening of the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly in the year 2000 for an overall\r\nreview and appraisal of the implementation of the outcome\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development. We support\r\nthe establishment of a preparatory committee of the whole\r\nof the General Assembly, which, under the provisions of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/202, will begin its\r\nactivities in 1998. The Group of 77 will endeavour to take\r\nall necessary measures to ensure the success of the special\r\nsession.\r\nIn conclusion, the implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development for poverty\r\neradication, enhancement of productive employment and\r\nsocial integration calls for concerted international action to\r\nintegrate the economies of developing countries into those\r\nof the developed world. The promotion of equal terms of\r\ntrade, increased production capacities and financial flows\r\nand technology transfer and acquisition are among the\r\nmajor steps towards the achievement of high, productive\r\nemployment and sustainable livelihoods, resulting ultimately\r\nin poverty eradication. As we prepare for the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly in the year 2000 for the\r\noverall review of the outcome of the World Social Summit,\r\nlet us bear in mind the realities in the developing countries\r\nand honour our commitments made in Copenhagen. We call\r\nupon our development partners, the developed countries, to\r\nsupport the developing countries, through technical and\r\nfinancial cooperation, in their efforts to improve their\r\nability and their competitive capacity to participate in the\r\nglobal economy on an equal basis.\r\nMs. Kaba Camara (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): The World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, held at Copenhagen in March 1995,\r\nbrought together an impressive number of world leaders,\r\ndemonstrating the importance the international community\r\nattaches to social issues, which are a gauge of progress in\r\nthe world.\r\nThe participants in the Social Summit committed\r\nthemselves to take steps to eradicate poverty, combat\r\nunemployment and achieve social integration for those on\r\nthe fringes of society. However, at the global level the\r\nmajor concern is above all to combat poverty. It is\r\nobvious that a policy to combat poverty cannot but\r\nimprove the living conditions of the unemployed and\r\nthose at risk.\r\nWhat have we done to honour the commitments we\r\nundertook at the Social Summit?\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), focusing its attention and its efforts on human\r\ndevelopment, has placed emphasis on social indices of\r\nhealth care, education, nutrition and social protection in\r\norder to demonstrate the level of instability experienced\r\nby the poorest populations.\r\nUNDP’s Human Development Report 1997\r\nconcentrated on poverty eradication, studying the causes\r\nof poverty in a changing world and the relationship\r\nbetween globalization and poverty. That report pointed\r\nout that 507 million of the world’s population have a life\r\nexpectancy of less than 40 years; 1.2 billion people do not\r\nhave access to drinking water; 158 million children are\r\nsuffering from hunger; 842 million people are illiterate;\r\nand 1.2 billion are living below the poverty threshold.\r\nThose statistics speak volumes and reveal the extent to\r\nwhich combating poverty should be the priority in the\r\ncoming years, both for international organizations and\r\nagencies and for every nation.\r\nAlthough it is true that all States, to varying degrees,\r\nare affected by poverty — for in some countries there are\r\npockets of poverty, whereas in many others, especially in\r\nAfrica, it is an endemic phenomenon — the international\r\ncommunity must support the efforts of the poorest\r\ncountries to break the vicious cycle of poverty.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nMore than half of the population of Africa, which is\r\nregarded as one of the United Nations priorities, are among\r\nthe poorest. Some of the countries on our continent are\r\nfacing famine, endemic diseases, AIDS, fratricidal wars —\r\ninternal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those\r\ncountries, to which are added such external causes as the\r\nfall in the price of commodities, the burden of foreign debt,\r\nbarriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of\r\nnearly 30 per cent in official development assistance. These\r\nfactors have worked to nullify the efforts of African\r\nGovernments to meet the basic needs of their peoples.\r\nAt the ministerial meeting of the Security Council on\r\nthe situation in Africa held on 25 September of this year,\r\nemphasis was laid on the fact that peace and security\r\ncannot be achieved in conditions of abject poverty.\r\nEconomic and social statistics on sub-Saharan Africa are a\r\ndire reflection of the living conditions of its peoples: of the\r\nregion’s 500 million inhabitants, 262 million live on less\r\nthan $1 per day, 290 million are illiterate, 200 million have\r\nno access to drinking water and poverty continues to take\r\nits toll.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report (A/52/305) on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development demonstrates the enthusiastic response\r\nof United Nations organs to questions pertaining to the\r\neradication of poverty. The Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment and the Commission on the Status of Women,\r\nthe substantive session of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nregional commissions and development institutions have all\r\nconsidered at their meetings the various aspects of poverty\r\nand strategies to combat it. This is encouraging. However,\r\nmy delegation hopes that future seminars, round-table\r\ndiscussions and expert studies will enable development\r\nbodies and bilateral donors to come up with concrete\r\nprogrammes and plans to attack the root causes of poverty\r\nand bring a glimmer of hope to poor populations.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the initiative of the micro-\r\ncredit summit to mobilize financial resources to help the\r\npoorest, and especially women, to gain access to credit. The\r\nGovernment of Côte d’Ivoire has made available to poor\r\nyoung people and women social funding to encourage\r\nemployment. However, that praiseworthy initiative at micro-\r\nfinancing is only one aspect of efforts needed to eliminate\r\npoverty.\r\nUNDP believes that for every inhabitant of developing\r\ncountries to have access to basic social services, $40 billion\r\nneeds to be invested yearly during the period from 1995 to\r\n2005. That sum represents only 0.2 per cent of world\r\nincome, 1 per cent of the income of developing countries\r\nand half the resources mobilized by the United States\r\nwithin the framework of the Marshall Plan to assist in the\r\nreconstruction of Europe.\r\nThose figures clearly show that the eradication of\r\npoverty is not a utopian notion if the political will exists.\r\nThis political will must translate not only into\r\nincreased resources for official development assistance,\r\nbut also into the creation of conditions conducive to the\r\neconomic and social development of our countries.\r\nAfrica needs realistic programmes with concrete\r\nresults. The United Nations Programme of Action for\r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development, the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s, the Alliance for Africa’s Industrialization and\r\nthe United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for\r\nAfrica all came and went without having any real impact\r\non the eradication of poverty in Africa.\r\nThe international community should support the\r\nAfrican countries in their attempts to achieve the goals\r\nthey have set themselves. To that end, it should take into\r\naccount, inter alia, the following priorities defined by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity: to establish an African\r\neconomic community through regional and subregional\r\nintegration to respond to the challenges of the\r\nglobalization of the economy; to maintain peace and\r\npolitical stability, without which development is\r\nimpossible; to promote human-resource development; to\r\naccelerate the continent’s industrialization; to facilitate\r\naccess to the external markets for African products and to\r\npromote the diversification of commodities; to eradicate\r\npoverty and to make basic social services accessible to\r\nall; to improve the living conditions of women and\r\nchildren; and to consolidate democracy and good\r\ngovernance.\r\nWe need a global and integrated approach, for the\r\nfight against poverty requires us to take into account all\r\nthese factors for social and economic development and\r\nthe well-being of peoples.\r\nAs the head of our delegation said during the general\r\ndebate, we reiterate our appreciation for the partnership\r\ninitiatives undertaken with the aim of helping Africa grow\r\nand develop its economic potential, improving its access\r\nto external markets and reducing its external debt burden.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to point out that my Government\r\nwelcomes the positive actions undertaken by several\r\ncountries on behalf of Africa, in particular the initiative of\r\nthe European Union referred to earlier. Any action targeting\r\nprojects to promote African development, and especially the\r\nstruggle against poverty, deserves our acknowledgment and\r\ngratitude.\r\nMr. Shafie (Malaysia): My delegation wishes to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his report, entitled\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development” and contained in document A/52/305.\r\nThe report provides an important and useful framework for\r\nour deliberations in this Assembly. My delegation also\r\nwishes to associate itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Tanzania on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China this morning.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development held in\r\nCopenhagen two years ago represents a landmark\r\nachievement for people-centred sustainable development.\r\nThree core themes were addressed at the Summit: the\r\neradication of poverty, the expansion of productive\r\nemployment and the reduction of unemployment, and the\r\npromotion of social integration. The Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and the World Summit’s Programme of Action\r\nreflected both national and international development\r\nefforts, recognizing that while social development remains\r\na national responsibility, the support and collective\r\ncommitments of the international community are essential\r\nfor achieving the goals set out in Copenhagen.\r\nOne of the major factors affecting social policies today\r\nis the globalization and liberalization of the world economy.\r\nWhile globalization increases the opportunities for greater\r\neconomic growth, it does not automatically bring faster\r\ngrowth and development. Its process has risks and costs,\r\nincluding social costs. As economies and societies become\r\nincreasingly interdependent due to the growth of\r\ninternational commerce, investment and finance, as well as\r\ngrowing communications and transport linkages, social\r\nproblems become globally diffused. In most cases,\r\nglobalization may have contributed to or aggravated\r\nexisting social ills, such as unemployment, or led to\r\nincreasing income inequality.\r\nGlobalization offers great opportunities, but only if it\r\nis managed more carefully and with more concern for\r\nglobal equity. In this regard, all countries and major\r\ninternational economic and financial agencies need to\r\nengage more seriously in efforts to formulate better policies\r\ntowards globalization. The impact of globalization on\r\ncountries and sections of society must be examined more\r\ndeeply. Poor countries, increasingly marginalized from the\r\nworld economy, need special support to help them reap\r\nthe benefits of globalization and integration. New forms\r\nof international cooperation must be devised that will\r\nmake it possible for all to share in the positive aspects of\r\neconomic globalization.\r\nThe eradication of poverty remains a priority goal of\r\nall developing countries. It is indeed very frustrating that,\r\ndespite repeated pledges by Governments to fight the\r\nscourge of poverty, more than a quarter of the developing\r\nworld’s people still live in abject poverty. Nearly a billion\r\nare illiterate and over a billion lack access to food and\r\nsafe water. Nearly a third of the people in the least\r\ndeveloped countries are not expected to survive beyond\r\nthe age of 40. Within these broad groups, some people\r\nsuffer more than others, particularly women, the young,\r\nthe old and the disabled.\r\nWhile the Declaration and Programme of Action of\r\nthe Copenhagen’s Summit have effectively defined the\r\nissues relating to poverty, employment and social\r\nintegration, issues on international assistance, official\r\ndevelopment assistance and new additional resources have\r\nfailed to break new ground. At the same time, major\r\ndonor countries have been reluctant to provide additional\r\nresources, while they try at the same time to maintain the\r\nhigh moral ground on human rights and fundamental\r\nhuman freedoms. It remains a disappointment that States\r\nMembers of the United Nations seem able only to define\r\nthe pressing issues of our times, such as poverty, and to\r\nrepeat the call for political commitment to alleviate such\r\nproblems. But the manifestations of political will, as the\r\nmost critical ingredient in our efforts for a better world,\r\nremain elusive.\r\nMalaysia believes that the eradication of poverty is\r\ncentral to all efforts to enhance social development. To\r\nachieve this, the international community must do its level\r\nbest to fund and apply additional resources to help assist\r\nthe development efforts of the developing countries. For\r\nthis to happen, the developed countries must make every\r\neffort to fulfil the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\nnational product for official development assistance. We\r\nwould urge developed countries to join the four countries\r\nthat have fulfilled their official development assistance\r\ntarget so as to enable the developing countries to\r\nundertake their social development programmes,\r\nparticularly in the areas of education, health and training.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nWe believe that serious consideration must be given to\r\nthe immediate cancellation of the bilateral, multilateral and\r\ncommercial debts of the least developed countries, without\r\nimposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable.\r\nThe benefits of debt relief could be channelled to support\r\neducation, health care, credit and poor rural development.\r\nThis would, in turn, enable poor countries to create an\r\nopportunity to promote foreign and private investment and\r\neconomic growth.\r\nWe are encouraged by the outcome of the micro-credit\r\nsummit held in Washington early this year. We applaud that\r\ninitiative taken by the World Bank, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and other United Nations agencies\r\nin mobilizing billions of dollars to provide loans to millions\r\nof the world’s poorest families. This is indeed a move in\r\nthe right direction to address the problem of poverty and\r\nunemployment in the least developed countries.\r\nEvery country needs sound policies and strategies for\r\nreducing overall poverty. However, this process needs to be\r\nundertaken by Government and civil society, including the\r\nprivate sector, in partnership. Malaysia welcomes the\r\nconstructive contributions of all the members of civil\r\nsociety, including non-governmental organizations, in the\r\nefforts to realize the agreed goals of the Social Summit.\r\nIn Malaysia the non-governmental organizations and\r\nthe private sector have complemented the Government’s\r\nprogramme for the poor and hardcore poor by providing\r\nthem with income-generating projects, improved\r\ninfrastructure and amenities and by implementing\r\nprogrammes to inculcate positive values among the poor.\r\nWe believe this is also the case in many other countries.\r\nWe welcome the contributions of the members of civil\r\nsociety at both the national and international levels, so long\r\nas they facilitate and do not impede the consensus-building\r\nprocess at the intergovernmental level.\r\nEradicating poverty is not an unattainable goal. The\r\nworld has natural and human resources as well as the\r\nknow-how to make a poverty-free world a reality. The\r\nchallenge for us now is how to mobilize action at the\r\ninternational and regional and national levels. Malaysia\r\nstrongly believes that with serious efforts and commitment\r\nfrom all parties the targets set out in the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action to eradicate poverty,\r\nunemployment and other social problems can be achieved.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nwish to say first of all that the delegation of Mexico shares\r\nin the statement made by the representative of Paraguay\r\non behalf of the Rio Group.\r\nThe holding of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in 1995 is one of the most significant events\r\nin the recent history of the United Nations. The Summit\r\nemphasized the importance of joining the opportunities\r\nprovided by the processes of economic liberalization and\r\nglobalization with the need to invest in the well-being and\r\ndevelopment of societies.\r\nAt the Copenhagen Summit we outlined the\r\nobjective of orienting our economies to respond to human\r\nneeds in a more effective manner, on solid bases and with\r\na long-term view. We undertook commitments and agreed\r\non measures to make progress towards the three priority\r\nobjectives: poverty eradication, generating productive\r\nemployment and social integration.\r\nTwo years after the Summit, Mexico continues to\r\nimplement concrete actions to comply with the goals\r\ncontained in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action. My Government has promoted a social\r\ndevelopment policy whose purpose is to raise the quality\r\nof life of Mexicans and to combat effectively and\r\ncomprehensively the deep-rooted causes of the problems\r\nof marginalization and extreme poverty which, I must\r\nacknowledge, still exist in my country.\r\nThe economic growth recorded in 1996 and 1997\r\nhas made it clear that the recovery strategy of recent\r\nyears is the right one. The objective is and of course will\r\nbe to improve progressively the standard of living and\r\nwell-being of Mexicans. The strengthening of the\r\neconomy has led to a significant increase in social\r\nspending. This year social spending in Mexico will rise to\r\nmore than $34 billion, which represents almost 56 per\r\ncent of the public sector budget and is equal to 9 per cent\r\nof the gross national product. This amount means an\r\nincrease of approximately 10 per cent, as compared to\r\nspending in 1996. Of that social spending 86 per cent will\r\nbe allotted to the areas of education, health and social\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn order to ensure that the resources for social\r\nspending reach those who need it most, the Government\r\nof Mexico has implemented a series of broad-ranging\r\nprogrammes which, while they are directed at the\r\npopulation in general, give particular attention to\r\nMexicans who face the most difficult living conditions.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nIn this context, this year we have undertaken an\r\neducation, health and food programme. Its objective is to\r\ntreat the causes of extreme poverty in an integral way\r\nthrough a series of specific activities. The effort is focused\r\non three basic areas: the expansion of the social\r\ninfrastructure, the creation of greater employment\r\nopportunities and providing support services for education,\r\nhealth and nutrition. By implementing this programme we\r\nseek to promote family participation, giving special\r\nattention to girls and boys.\r\nAdditionally, in order to broaden and raise the quality\r\nof public medical services, a reform of the national health\r\nsystem has been undertaken through the Health Programme\r\n2000, from which some positive results have already been\r\nachieved, particularly for people with limited resources.\r\nOne of the main results of the economic and social\r\nstrategy has been the creation of between 1.3 and 1.4\r\nmillion jobs this year. This is undoubtedly an encouraging\r\nsign.\r\nWe are aware that there are considerable challenges to\r\nbe met in order to overcome the remaining historical\r\npoverty which still affects millions of people. That is why\r\nwe are determined to continue to adopt measures to\r\nstrengthen the tie which exists between growth and social\r\nequity, thereby fulfilling one of the main commitments of\r\nCopenhagen: namely, to create the conditions which will\r\nmake the human being the main actor in development, and\r\ntherefore a participant in and beneficiary of the national\r\nwell-being.\r\nThe Summit underlines the fact that social\r\ndevelopment and the fulfilment of the commitments adopted\r\nare primarily the responsibility of each country. At the\r\nsame time, it points out that it is essential to establish a\r\nfavourable international environment based on international\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nWe note with concern that despite the dynamic state\r\nof the world economy, the inequality between developing\r\nand developed countries is growing. The President of the\r\nWorld Bank recently declared that, given the present rate of\r\npopulation growth, in 30 years five billion people will have\r\nto survive on less than two dollars per day. The outlook\r\ncould not be gloomier. At the same time, and as a painful\r\nparadox, the development assistance promised at the\r\nSummit as an essential element for achieving social\r\ndevelopment has declined considerably. In many cases, this\r\ndecline has made it more difficult to achieve the goals\r\nestablished in Copenhagen, and made the possibility of\r\ndoing so more remote.\r\nIt is essential to reverse this trend. If we do not, we\r\nwill find ourselves at the beginning of the new\r\nmillennium in a terribly discouraging situation. Economic\r\ngrowth, social justice and shared responsibility are\r\nindivisible. National efforts require the support of the\r\nentire international community. It is necessary for all\r\nparties involved — Governments, the United Nations\r\nsystem and the system’s financial institutions — to\r\nredouble their efforts to strengthen international\r\ncooperation.\r\nThis is not merely an act of solidarity. It is also a\r\nhistorical responsibility to mankind.\r\nMr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam): At the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, Heads of State and\r\nGovernment and world leaders came together to work out\r\nstrategies for social development, especially how to find\r\nsolutions related to such questions as poverty,\r\nemployment, social integration and other socio-economic\r\nissues. Most significantly, the highest commitments were\r\nmade with the adoption of the Declaration and the\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nThe delegation of Viet Nam associates itself with the\r\nstatement made by the Chairman of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nWe are pleased to note that since the Summit\r\nconsiderable efforts have been made in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. In putting\r\ntheir commitments into practice, Member States have\r\ndeveloped strategies, programmes and projects and\r\nincluded them in their overall socio-economic\r\ndevelopment policies. The United Nations and its agencies\r\nhave also made great efforts in this regard, for which my\r\ndelegation wishes to express its great appreciation. Those\r\nefforts are commendable, but what is left to be fulfilled\r\nis enormous if we wish to achieve a better environment\r\nfor social development, especially in the coming decades\r\nof the next millennium.\r\nOur delegation is very much encouraged to see that\r\nthe United Nations has been playing a leading role in the\r\nfield of economic and social development and providing\r\nassistance and support for the efforts of nations. In this\r\nregard, we welcome the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the Agenda for Development. On this\r\noccasion, we express our full support for the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations, especially the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, and agree that the United\r\nNations should accord development the highest priority.\r\nThis will enable the United Nations and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council to play a more effective role in this field,\r\ncontributing to the creation of a favourable environment for\r\nsocial development. We therefore welcome the reform\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General, in particular the\r\nidentification of the promotion of sustainable and sustained\r\ndevelopment as a central priority of the United Nations.\r\nWith this strengthened United Nations role for\r\ndevelopment, it is our belief that the United Nations will\r\ncertainly be able to support nations more effectively in their\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the Copenhagen\r\nProgramme of Action. We wish to take this opportunity to\r\ncommend the 1997 Report on the World Social Situation,\r\nwhich is composed of comprehensive and far-reaching\r\nassessments of global social issues as well as\r\nrecommendations for policy options.\r\nAs has been recognized by the Summit, social\r\ndevelopment is central to the needs and aspirations of\r\npeople throughout the world and to the responsibilities of\r\nall nations. To achieve progress, we need to tackle the three\r\nmain issues — poverty eradication, productive employment\r\nand social integration — with an integrated approach. In\r\nreviewing the two-and-a-half-year follow-up to the\r\nCopenhagen Summit, while addressing the various issues of\r\nsocial development, I shall focus on the question of poverty\r\nalleviation and eradication, which is the most urgent and\r\nbasic task currently facing the larger part of the world\r\npopulation: that of the developing world. As pointed out at\r\nCopenhagen, social development is the result of many\r\nrelated issues. Poverty remains an acute problem for most\r\ndeveloping countries, due to slow economic growth and low\r\nincome, very often aggravated by the increasing burden of\r\ndebt. Poverty has been a major factor constraining the\r\nefforts of these countries to provide better living conditions\r\nfor their populations and to create a more favourable\r\nenvironment for social development. Poverty and economic\r\ndifficulties have given rise to greater unemployment and\r\nhave at the same time limited their capacity to provide\r\nbetter-quality education as well as other basic needs for the\r\ndaily life of the people, such as water, sanitation, health\r\ncare and other social services. Under such circumstances,\r\nmany developing countries would find it extremely difficult\r\nto escape the downward spiral toward backwardness. We\r\nrecognize that great efforts have been made by developing\r\ncountries, resulting in considerable progress. But as the\r\ngeneral picture shows, the question of poverty and its\r\nalleviation continues to call for greater common efforts. In\r\nthis regard, we also urge that greater support and assistance\r\nbe given to developing countries by the international\r\ncommunity. All commitments related to the establishment\r\nof a favourable international environment for social\r\ndevelopment need to be more effectively realized.\r\nWith regard to poverty alleviation, we commend the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for its\r\nimportant role in the United Nations system and for its\r\nefforts to support the implementation of social-\r\ndevelopment programmes. We support UNDP’s efforts in\r\nfighting world poverty, considering it to be UNDP’s most\r\nimportant job. In many developing countries, UNDP, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and many\r\nother United Nations agencies have effectively helped\r\ndevelop national strategies for poverty eradication and\r\nplans of action. These strategies include promoting high\r\nrates of economic expansion, creating employment,\r\ninvesting in human-resources development, advancing and\r\nexpanding opportunities for the poor, targeting poverty\r\nand providing a safety net for vulnerable groups such as\r\nchildren, women, the disabled, the old, poor people and\r\nothers.\r\nMr. Kpotsra (Togo), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAt the same time, these anti-poverty strategies are to\r\nbe defined and implemented in the larger context of\r\ncreating an environment that encourages and supports\r\nequitable, broad-based economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment at both the national and international levels.\r\nThe 1997 Report on the World Social Situation has\r\nnoted that the problem of unemployment appears more\r\ndifficult to solve today than it did 50 years ago. It is\r\nnecessary for us, therefore, to give greater support and\r\nassistance to the efforts of developing countries aimed at\r\nexpanding their economy and productive activities that\r\ncan generate employment.\r\nFor all countries, whether developed or developing,\r\na good educational system is the key to progress in the\r\nfield of human resources development, which in turn will\r\nensure development and prosperity, especially in this\r\ninformation age and in the coming twenty-first century. A\r\nwell-educated, highly developed and healthy population\r\nconstitutes one of the most valuable resources a country\r\ncan have.\r\nViet Nam is fully committed to the objectives and\r\nprinciples stipulated in the documents of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. We have made\r\ncombined efforts to achieve our socio-economic goals and\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nto realize the commitments we set at the Summit. The\r\nprocess of renewal in Viet Nam, carried out since 1986, has\r\nachieved a considerable reduction in poverty and a higher\r\nstandard of living and well-being for the people. Building\r\non our many remarkable socio-economic achievements over\r\nthe past 10 years, we must continue to make greater efforts\r\nto consolidate our achievements and advance further in the\r\nfield of socio-economic development, with a view to\r\nattaining the goal of “wealthy people, a strong country and\r\na just and civilized society” for Viet Nam through the\r\nprocess of industrialization and modernization. In order to\r\ndo so, the Government has formulated policies to bring\r\nabout further progress in, inter alia, poverty alleviation,\r\nproductive employment expansion and educational reform.\r\nSpecial attention is being paid to education, science\r\nand technology in order to lay the foundations for\r\nindustrialization and modernization. Viet Nam has\r\nconsistently pursued a policy of economic development in\r\nparallel with social progress and equality. In this context,\r\nwe support the 20/20 initiative as one of the measures\r\naimed at achieving access for all to basic social services. I\r\nam pleased to inform the Assembly that Viet Nam has\r\nagreed to host the second follow-up meeting on the 20/20\r\ninitiative, known as Oslo + 2, in Hanoi next autumn. We\r\nsee it as a positive response to the calls of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development for joint efforts by many\r\ncountries. In this regard, my delegation welcomes all the\r\ncountries supportive of the idea, in particular Norway and\r\nthe Netherlands.\r\nEarlier this year, in September, Viet Nam and the\r\nUnited Nations agencies held a conference in Hanoi to\r\nreview 20 years of cooperation between Viet Nam and the\r\nUnited Nations and to work out strategies to enhance\r\nfurther that effective cooperation.\r\nIn closing, I wish to express once again our deep\r\nappreciation to the United Nations agencies for their\r\nassistance to Viet Nam, especially those in the fields of\r\npoverty elimination, health care, education and social\r\nintegration.\r\nMr. Oda (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nshould like to state at the outset that the Egyptian\r\ndelegation supports the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Tanzania as Chairman of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nIt is clear that the promotion of social development\r\nhas become an important and basic objective in today’s\r\nworld. Similarly, support for the efforts made to achieve\r\nsocial progress and justice and to better the human\r\ncondition is urgently needed in order to respond to the\r\naspirations of peoples, who are asking that pride of place\r\nbe given to the social aspects of development because of\r\ntheir close interrelationship with its economic and\r\npolitical aspects. This interconnection is such that these\r\naspects now form an indivisible whole that can affect —\r\npositively or negatively — international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe States that took part in the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development in Copenhagen have become aware\r\nof the need to achieve social development. Convinced of\r\nthe need effectively to tackle the problems confronting\r\nthem in this area, they have committed themselves to\r\ncreating an economic, social, political, cultural and\r\necological environment that is conducive to social\r\ndevelopment, as well as to giving priority to national and\r\ninternational policies and initiatives aimed at eliminating\r\npoverty, promoting employment, combating\r\nunemployment and fostering social integration.\r\nI should like to emphasize two key points that\r\nshould serve as guiding principles in the area of social\r\ndevelopment. First, different cultures and civilizations\r\nmust be respected, because there can be no justification\r\nfor replacing them with unacceptable lifestyles and\r\npractices. Secondly, although we acknowledge that\r\nGovernments must play the primary role in the peace\r\nprocess, we believe that in order for those efforts to be\r\nsuccessful a favourable international environment must be\r\ncreated, including the proper conditions for trade,\r\ninvestment, the provision of financial resources, technical\r\nassistance and the transfer of technology.\r\nPoverty is one of the greatest challenges our world\r\nfaces. Governments and the international community must\r\nintensify their efforts effectively to combat poverty,\r\nespecially since we have committed ourselves to this goal\r\nas a moral, social, political and economic necessity for all\r\nhumankind.\r\nThe issue of productive employment and sustainable\r\nlivelihoods is closely linked to the question of poverty.\r\nUnemployment has become so endemic that it could rend\r\nthe social fabric of many developing countries, especially\r\nsince the trend is towards economic policies aimed at\r\nfighting inflation and budgetary deficits at the expense of\r\nemployment and conditions of work.\r\nEgypt has participated actively in the work of the\r\nCommission for Social Development, of which it is proud\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nto be a member. The Commission, which at its thirty-fifth\r\nsession considered the question of employment and\r\nsustainable livelihoods, reached certain agreed conclusions\r\nthat have as their goal productive employment; decreasing\r\nunemployment through improved social services, such as\r\neducation and health care; giving loans to the private sector\r\nin both urban and rural areas; and improving information\r\nand guidance services.\r\nWe encourage all countries to participate actively in\r\nthe work of the Commission during its upcoming sessions.\r\nIn this respect, we are particularly hopeful that efforts will\r\nbe made jointly to take up the major challenge of preparing\r\nfor the special session of the General Assembly in the year\r\n2000 for the overall review of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. Egypt hopes that the special session will be\r\nwell prepared, generate strong interest and achieve the\r\nnecessary consensus for its success.\r\nThe issues of families, women, children, young\r\npeople, the elderly and the disabled are closely related and\r\ncomplementary, and they affect the overall development of\r\nevery society. My country appreciates the enormous efforts\r\nmade by developed and developing countries alike to\r\naddress the great challenge of sustainable economic and\r\nsocial development, despite the weighty responsibilities\r\nimposed upon them by economic reform.\r\nEgypt has begun the implementation of an integrated\r\npolicy for the year 2000, to reduce poverty and achieve\r\nhuman development. Contrary to a predicted decline in\r\npublic spending, spending on public services has been\r\nincreased from 3 per cent to 4.5 per cent of gross domestic\r\nproduct, especially in the area of education. Beyond its\r\nongoing efforts to provide basic education and health care\r\nfor all in cities and in villages, Egypt has built up and is\r\nbolstering a network of social services intended to help the\r\npoor by providing basic products and services and by\r\noffering productive employment. Our Fund for Social\r\nDevelopment is one of the most important of our social-\r\nsecurity networks. It has created jobs for some 10 per cent\r\nto 12 per cent of Egypt’s unemployed, although the\r\nprincipal goal is not to fight unemployment but to limit the\r\nnegative impact of the process of economic reform.\r\nThe family is the keystone of development, and the\r\nEgyptian Government lays stress on its societal role for\r\ndevelopment. By 1996 my Government had established 150\r\nspecial offices to address this issue. Young people are the\r\npillars of the present and the symbols of the future. That is\r\nwhy Egypt has taken care to educate them and prepare\r\nthem for the challenges of the twenty-first century, and why\r\nit has conducted seminars and established institutes to that\r\nend. It is our hope that the international ministerial\r\nconference on young people to be held at Lisbon next\r\nAugust will be successful.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the declaration of 1999 as\r\nthe International Year of the Older Person, and supports\r\nthe activities of the fourth meeting of the working group\r\nto consider and evaluate the plan of action and to make\r\npreparations for the Year. For its part, Egypt is making\r\npreparations of its own. In this sphere, my country has\r\nadopted a national programme for older persons, and has\r\norganized seminars to increase awareness of the issues of\r\nthe Year. Egypt is also participating in regional and\r\ninternational preparatory efforts for the Year. Notably, we\r\nshall participate in the conference on the elderly in the\r\nMediterranean region to be held in Malta in December.\r\nWe hope that this will result in the adoption of a regional\r\nplan for the Mediterranean countries. My country attaches\r\nthe highest importance to rehabilitation and training for\r\nolder people to enable them fully to play their role in\r\nsociety, through the creation of good jobs appropriate to\r\ntheir skills.\r\nLet me reaffirm the importance of combining\r\nnational, regional and international efforts to promote and\r\nsupport social development in all its forms and in all\r\nspheres. I appeal to all States and Governments to commit\r\nthemselves to implement the recommendations adopted at\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development, and to honour\r\ntheir commitments, especially in the area of mobilizing\r\nresources and providing technical assistance to developing\r\ncountries. Social development is a collective international\r\nresponsibility that affects both our daily lives and the\r\nfuture of our world.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): My delegation welcomes\r\nand appreciates the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, contained in document A/52/305,\r\nand looks forward to his forthcoming report on the first\r\nUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty.\r\nMay I state at the outset that we fully align ourselves\r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China as well as with the statement to be\r\ndelivered later today by the representative of Lesotho on\r\nbehalf of the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC).\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development was\r\nconvened at a time when the countries of the world had\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nidentified common goals and a common drive: to cooperate\r\ninternationally in creating an economic, political, social,\r\ncultural and legal environment that would enable people to\r\nachieve social development.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that many Member States\r\nhave reported to the United Nations on national action\r\ntaken in the implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. The Government of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland has made great strides in drafting\r\nand negotiating a National Development Strategy of its\r\nown, and will provide the United Nations with a copy in\r\nthe near future. The strategy represents a new, improved\r\nand comprehensive planning system. It contains long-term\r\nobjectives, policies and strategies necessary to achieve the\r\nthree broad objectives of a vibrant economy, good\r\ngovernance and human and social development.\r\nHaving realized the socio-economic difficulties which\r\nwere emerging, including increasing unemployment, a high\r\npopulation growth rate, escalating crime and the\r\ndisintegration of the social fabric among Swazi society, the\r\nGovernment initiated the National Development Strategy\r\ntwo years before the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment was held at Copenhagen. The declining socio-\r\neconomic situation called for an appropriate and effective\r\nstrategy which would both mobilize popular support for the\r\ncountry’s process of economic development and ensure\r\neffective use of resources. The strategy seeks to address the\r\ncommitments made in Copenhagen at the national level.\r\nAs stated by His Majesty King Mswati III in his\r\npolicy statement during this session of the General\r\nAssembly, our own internal restructuring programme is\r\ncontinuing, and the Government has begun a series of\r\ninitiatives to improve the socio-economic situation. An\r\nimportant aspect of the initiatives reflects the amount of\r\nconsultations and of participation by the stakeholders in the\r\ndiscussion of views and aspirations.\r\nOur Economic and Social Reform Agenda — a two-\r\nto-three-year agenda which will contribute to, and\r\naccelerate progress towards the National Development\r\nStrategy — was launched in February this year as a\r\nselection of important actions and targets with clear\r\ndeadlines attached to them. Again, the Government\r\nconsulted widely and publicly, and the reports have been\r\nwidely publicized.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is ever mindful that there\r\nis a need for an enabling environment conducive to the\r\nrealization of sustainable human development. To this end,\r\nthe Constitutional Review Commission was set up in July\r\n1996 and was given the assignment of full consultation\r\nwith the Swazi nation in drafting a new Constitution. The\r\nassignment is scheduled to take two years. The\r\nachievement of a universally recognized Constitution\r\nconsistent with the culture and traditions of the Kingdom\r\nof Swaziland will be a very significant achievement.\r\nThe Government and people of the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland are committed to effecting these initiatives, and\r\nfor a very good reason. Socio-economic growth in its\r\nsimplest form should result in the production of more\r\ngoods and services with increased efficiency. The\r\nproblem of unemployment would be addressed. Economic\r\ngrowth is the route to higher wages, greater profits and\r\nhigher tax revenue, thus leading to improvement in\r\nagriculture, health education and other social services.\r\nSwaziland is set to put that sequence in motion.\r\nIt is unfortunate, however, that the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland has a number of critical elements to deal with.\r\nThe rate of population growth, at 3.2 per cent per annum,\r\nis too high. This presents a serious difficulty in achieving\r\nCommitment 3 made at the Social Summit, that of\r\npromoting the goal of full employment as a basic priority\r\nof our economic and social policies and of enabling all\r\nSwazis to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods\r\nthrough freely chosen productive employment and work.\r\nEfforts to reduce the rate of population growth are under\r\nway. The Government has set up a task force to develop\r\na population policy and a programme to reduce the\r\npopulation growth rate.\r\nMy delegation would also like to reiterate the\r\nconcern expressed by His Majesty King Mswati III about\r\nthe presence of El Niño in the Pacific Ocean, only five\r\nyears after the last drought. All the countries in southern\r\nAfrica have hardly recovered from the two-year drought\r\nof 1991 and 1992; now they will soon have to face these\r\ndevastating problems again. Swaziland, having been hard\r\nhit in 1992, is still in the process of constructing water\r\nreservoirs and dams throughout the rural areas, by way of\r\nchanging from the relief approach to early preparedness.\r\nMost unfortunately, the disastrous effects of the drought\r\nare foreseen to hit before the projects are completed.\r\nOn this same subject of natural disasters, we wish to\r\nextend our deepest sympathy as a country, to Mexico,\r\nwhich has recently been hard hit by floods, costing that\r\ncountry much social disruption, but also many lives. We\r\ntherefore extend our deepest condolences to the\r\nGovernment, and in particular to the families concerned.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nHaving addressed some of the areas in which\r\nSwaziland is making efforts to honour commitments made\r\nin Copenhagen, my delegation would like to reiterate that\r\ninternational, regional and subregional cooperation and\r\nassistance are also essential for the full implementation of\r\nthe Copenhagen Programme of Action.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 50/161 recognizes that\r\nthe implementation of the Declaration Programme of Action\r\nin developing countries, particularly in Africa and the least\r\ndeveloped countries, will need additional financial resources\r\nand more effective development cooperation and assistance.\r\nIt is disturbing to note, though, that while efforts are being\r\nmade to develop such provisions, developing countries are\r\nstill faced with major problems of external debt and debt-\r\nservicing, marginalization in the context of globalization of\r\nthe world economy and problems of developed countries\r\nnot fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally\r\nagreed official development assistance targets. This is\r\nevidenced by the outcome of the high-level segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council held in Geneva in July this\r\nyear.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland fully supports the holding\r\nof the special session of the General Assembly in the year\r\n2000 for the overall review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development. It is our hope that the General\r\nAssembly, having learned from the achievements and\r\nfailures in the five years since the adoption of the\r\nCopenhagen Programme of Action, will adopt further\r\nactions and initiatives.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 50/161 further invited\r\nregional Commissions to consider convening, on a biennial\r\nbasis, a meeting at a high political level to review progress\r\nmade towards implementing the outcome of the Summit, to\r\nexchange views on their respective experiences and to adopt\r\nthe appropriate measures. The Secretary-General’s report\r\nreflects on the outcome of the meetings held. It is\r\nregrettable to note that the Economic Commission for\r\nAfrica has not yet convened such an important meeting,\r\ngiven that the world at the Summit focused on Africa in\r\nCommitment 7, which specifically called for accelerated\r\nefforts at economic, social and human resource\r\ndevelopment of Africa and the least developed countries. In\r\nthis regard, my delegation urges the Economic Commission\r\nfor Africa, in cooperation with the Organization of African\r\nUnity and other intergovernmental organizations in the\r\nregion, as well as the African Development Bank, to\r\nconvene as soon as practicable a high-level meeting as\r\ncalled for in the resolution.\r\nMay I conclude by stating that the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland appreciates the role played by the United\r\nNations funds and programmes in the country, particularly\r\nthat of the United Nations Development Programme. It is\r\nour fervent hope that as we formulate our strategies to\r\nadvance our social and economic policies assistance will\r\nbe forthcoming in the future whenever a request is made.\r\nAt a subregional level, Swaziland is committed to all\r\nthe efforts of the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC). The Kingdom of Swaziland, one of\r\nthe founding member States of SADC, commends all the\r\nassistance and cooperation given by United Nations\r\nMember States to the community, either bilaterally or as\r\nregional and subregional groupings, as well as from\r\norgans, organizations and bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nMr. Khan Kanju (Pakistan): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I would like to reaffirm Pakistan’s\r\ncommitment to the implementation of the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and the Programme of Action adopted at the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development.\r\nPakistan is one of those countries that have already\r\nstarted implementation of the Programme of Action in\r\nearnest. As we see it, the 10 commitments endorsed at the\r\nSocial Summit broadly fall into two categories. In the\r\nfirst category are commitments to strategies which seek\r\nto establish an enabling environment for social\r\ndevelopment; and in the second category are\r\ncommitments to ensure poverty eradication, productive\r\nemployment and social integration.\r\nAs part of establishing an enabling environment,\r\nwhich is essential for social development, Pakistan has\r\nstarted implementation of both categories of commitment.\r\nWe realized that the creation of a stable economic\r\nenvironment was essential for any meaningful\r\ndevelopment. We therefore started strengthening our\r\neconomic liberalization programme, which was initiated\r\nin early 1990, by introducing reforms in the corporate,\r\nbanking and financial sectors. Maximum tariff rates were\r\nreduced; full convertibility of the Pakistan rupee on\r\ncurrent account was achieved; and all import restrictions,\r\nwith very few exceptions, were withdrawn. Now\r\ninvestors, both Pakistani and foreign, can invest in\r\nPakistan without seeking prior governmental approval,\r\nexcept in a few notified negative areas.\r\nPakistan has also started a privatization programme\r\nin an open and transparent manner. All related documents\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nare available for public scrutiny. A law on the freedom of\r\ninformation has been enacted to ensure that information on\r\ngovernance is available to all segments of society to\r\nencourage participatory and transparent governance. The\r\nGovernment also wishes to establish an environmental\r\nprotection agency for enforcement and compliance with the\r\nNational Environmental Quality Standards.\r\nThe corruption associated with governance has always\r\nbeen a matter of serious concern for the general public. The\r\nspread of this evil threatens the social harmony and smooth\r\ndevelopment of societies and countries. To create an\r\nenabling environment for development, the Government of\r\nPakistan, under Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif,\r\nhas recently established an independent Accountability\r\nCommission, headed by a retired Judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt, to deal with corrupt elements in the highest echelons\r\nof the Government and to ensure probity in public life. This\r\nwill help in eradicating corruption from public life as well\r\nas in making governance fully accountable.\r\nPakistan recognizes the role of non-governmental\r\norganizations and other actors in civil society in achieving\r\nsocial harmony and social integration. A law has recently\r\nbeen drafted to provide an institutional foundation to\r\nestablish partnership between non-governmental\r\norganizations and the Government for the delivery of\r\ndevelopment and social services. This reflects the\r\nGovernment’s belief in integrating community-based\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations in the\r\nplanning, implementation and delivery of social services.\r\nPakistan has ratified the Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,\r\nand the provisions relating to women are fully enshrined in\r\nour Constitution. The Government is making special efforts\r\nto bring women into the national mainstream by providing\r\nequal opportunities in all walks of life. In the general\r\nelections this year six women were elected on general seats\r\nto the National Assembly of Pakistan. A proposal is under\r\nconsideration for 20 more seats, reserved for women, to be\r\nadded to the National Assembly. The Government has\r\ndecided to bridge the gender imbalance in the job market\r\nby giving preference to women in future recruitment in\r\nvarious fields. Women are also being encouraged to set up\r\ntheir own vocational centres, for which the Government\r\nwould provide financial assistance.\r\nPakistan ratified the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild in November 1990. Since then, the National\r\nCommission on Child Welfare and Development in the\r\nMinistry of Social Welfare has become a focal point for\r\ncoordination with provincial governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations for implementing the\r\nConvention on the Rights of Child. To ensure that all\r\nchildren are provided with equal opportunities for\r\neducation, a compulsory education act of 1995 has been\r\nenforced in the Province of Punjab. Other Provinces are\r\nalso formulating similar laws. The Child Offenders Act\r\n1995 has been approved by the Federal Cabinet and is\r\nawaiting parliamentary approval. This Act provides for\r\nthe rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents.\r\nIn another effort, the Ministry of Social Welfare is\r\nin the process of starting a project to establish homes for\r\nthe destitute. These homes will provide shelter, education,\r\nhealth and other facilities to target groups. The\r\nGovernment has also established 35 centres for the\r\nrehabilitation of children involved in child labour in the\r\ncountry. These will cater for the basic education, training,\r\nhealth care and recreation of the children. The centres\r\nwill also provide some financial benefit to the child’s\r\nfamily as part of measures to combat poverty and the\r\neconomic exploitation of the child. The Planning\r\nCommission of Pakistan proposes to update the National\r\nPlan of Action for Children, which was launched in 1990,\r\nfor incorporation into the ninth Five-Year Plan starting in\r\n1998.\r\nUnemployment and poverty, both human and\r\neconomic, are the two major challenges confronting the\r\nresource-poor developing countries. Unemployment and\r\nunderemployment undermine cohesion and stability. They\r\nrepresent a waste of resources and are a major cause of\r\npolitical instability in many regions of the world. The\r\nInternational Labour Organization has estimated that there\r\nare close to 1 billion people in the world who are either\r\nunemployed or underemployed. This accounts for\r\napproximately 30 per cent of the entire global labour\r\nforce. The world community must move quickly to ensure\r\nthe productive use of this enormous potential.\r\nPoverty reflects a lack of access to basic human\r\nneeds and a denial of choices and opportunities for living\r\na tolerable life. The United Nations Development\r\nProgramme Human Development Report for 1997 has\r\nestimated that a quarter of the world’s population —\r\napproximately 1.3 billion people — live in severe\r\npoverty. It has described it, on page 2, as being\r\nscandalous,\r\n“reflecting shameful inequalities and inexcusable\r\nfailures of national and international policy”.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nThe report goes on to warn, on page 3, that\r\n“new global pressures are creating or threatening\r\nfurther increases in poverty.”\r\nThis is alarming, and calls for urgent action.\r\nIn a modest effort to tackle the twin menace of\r\npoverty and unemployment, Pakistan has launched the four-\r\nyear Social Action Programme Project II for 1996-2000,\r\nwith an outlay of 270 billion rupees. It focuses on poverty\r\neradication, primary education, basic health care, family\r\nplanning, sanitation and rural water supply. The\r\nempowerment of women, the generation of employment and\r\nenvironmental protection have also been included within its\r\nframework. The Programme is geared to raising the state of\r\nhuman resource development in Pakistan. It emphasizes\r\nconsolidation, capacity-building and assurances of\r\nsustainability through non-governmental organizations and\r\nthe private sector.\r\nThe Government of Pakistan has also taken steps to\r\nmitigate the negative effects of the economic reforms on\r\nthe disadvantaged and marginalized groups of society.\r\nThese measures include the establishment of a Poverty\r\nAlleviation Fund; the implementation of the Rural Support\r\nProgramme, through non-governmental organizations, based\r\non participatory principles; the construction of farm-to-\r\nmarket roads; the provision of loans to enable the\r\nunemployed to start their own businesses; the provision of\r\ntechnical and financial assistance to micro-enterprises; the\r\nestablishment of vocational and technical training centres,\r\nincluding training centres for women; financial and\r\ntechnical assistance to non-governmental organizations\r\nunder participatory development programmes; the\r\nestablishment of Health and Education Foundations for\r\nupgrading education; and health facilities and monetary\r\nsupport to the poor, the indigent and the disabled from the\r\nZakat and Usher funds. In addition, the Government has\r\nestablished schemes like the National Individual Pension,\r\nWorkers’ Welfare Foundations, the Workers’ Profit\r\nParticipation Fund and the Workers’ Children Education\r\nFund, to improve the real long-term earning of workers.\r\nPakistan has started implementation of the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration on Social Development and the Programme of\r\nAction of the World Summit for Social Development in the\r\nbelief that development implies upward movement of the\r\nentire social system. However, with its low level of\r\ndomestic savings, it would be difficult for Pakistan to\r\nsustain this effort without international support. We\r\nearnestly hope that developed countries, the United Nations\r\nand the Bretton Woods institutions will honour their\r\ncommitments to earmark 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\ndomestic product for official development assistance and\r\nrescheduling of debts, as stipulated in the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. Without this\r\nsupport the dream of social development in low-income\r\ncountries like Pakistan will remain an illusion.\r\nMr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): Since the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, the question of social development\r\nhas drawn increasing attention all over the world. The\r\nshort-, medium- and long-term strategies and plans for\r\nsocial development formulated by many countries and the\r\nconcrete measures taken in this regard have brought about\r\nprogress in the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nSummit at the national level. The resolutions adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the Commission on Social Development and\r\nmeasures taken to implement them have also played a\r\npositive role in promoting social development. However,\r\nwhen discussing such progress, we must also point out\r\nthat action has been rather slow in developing the\r\nsubstantive international cooperation promised at the\r\nSummit. Concern on this question is therefore justified.\r\nAs is well known, poverty is the major obstacle to\r\nsocial development as well as a serious threat to peace\r\nand stability. The eradication of poverty is of paramount\r\nimportance to the international community. It was\r\ntherefore the first of the three core issues discussed at the\r\nSummit. However, more than two years after the Summit,\r\nwe see no major improvement in the social situation of\r\nthe world. One fifth of the world’s population continues\r\nto live in absolute poverty. Heavy indebtedness continues\r\nto plague some developing countries, seriously hampering\r\ntheir efforts for economic growth and social development.\r\nThe gap between the North and the South continues to\r\nwiden. It is surely the main responsibility of each\r\ncountry’s Government to achieve the objectives set at the\r\nSummit, but international cooperation and support are\r\nvitally important for the promotion of global social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is our view that the key to the eradication of\r\npoverty is the availability of resources, for the lack of\r\nresources is one of the important factors hampering the\r\nefforts of developing countries to combat poverty and\r\nbackwardness. To achieve the objectives set at the\r\nSummit, we maintain that:, first, developed countries\r\nshould, at an early date fulfil their obligations to\r\ncontribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nofficial development assistance and take more concrete\r\nmeasures for developing countries in terms of economic\r\nassistance, technological cooperation and the reduction and\r\ncancellation of debt. Secondly, the United Nations should\r\nfocus its efforts for social development on developing\r\ncountries and play a central coordinating role in promoting\r\nthe follow-up to the Summit. Such a role should centre on\r\nensuring comprehensive implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe Summit and of a number of important international\r\nconferences related to social development, particularly as\r\nregards mobilizing and assembling financial resources, to\r\nhelp developing countries eradicate poverty and promote\r\nsocial development. Solid progress by the United Nations\r\nin this regard will be its most valuable contribution to the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Summit.\r\nMay I take this opportunity to brief the Assembly on\r\nChina’s implementation of the outcome of the Summit.\r\nIn its Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for National\r\nEconomic and Social Development and the Outline of the\r\n2010 Long-Range Objectives formulated in 1996, the\r\nChinese Government set the monumental goal of basically\r\neradicating poverty by the end of this century. The Plan and\r\nOutline are now being implemented in poverty-stricken\r\nareas in the form of development-oriented poverty\r\nalleviation.\r\nDevelopment-oriented poverty alleviation closely\r\ncombines poverty relief with local plans for national\r\neconomic and social development with a view to changing\r\nconditions for agricultural production in poverty-stricken\r\nareas and improving their ecological environment. In these\r\nprogrammes, local governments focus on supporting\r\ndevelopment of farmland and such infrastructure projects as\r\nrural roads, drinking water projects and small-scale\r\nirrigation works; on supporting the development of farming,\r\nanimal husbandry, forestry, processing of farm products,\r\ntransportation and marketing that directly affect food and\r\nclothing for households in poverty; and on supporting the\r\ndevelopment of resource-oriented and labour-intensive rural\r\nenterprises that can help local people shake off poverty and\r\nget rich by taking advantage of local resources.\r\nThe central Government has strengthened the\r\nmanagement of poverty-relief resources, provided\r\npreferential treatment in terms of taxation and investment\r\npolicy and launched an extensive and in-depth campaign to\r\nmobilize all social sectors to support the development of\r\npoverty-stricken areas. By implementing these and other,\r\nrelated measures, China seeks to attain the goal of\r\nproviding adequate food and clothing for 12 million rural\r\nresidents living in poverty in 1997 and basically to solve\r\nthe problem of food and clothing for 58 million people\r\nliving in poverty by the end of the century.\r\nAs always, China will support the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations in the field of social development, take an\r\nactive part in international cooperation for social\r\ndevelopment and make its appropriate contribution to\r\nsocial development in the world as a whole.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria): (interpretation from French):\r\nMay I begin by expressing my unreserved support for,\r\nand endorsement of, the statement made on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China by the representative of Tanzania.\r\nThe mobilization of the international community\r\naround social issues, illustrated by the adoption of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action,\r\nclearly shows that social issues are now the major\r\nconcern of all societies, whatever their level of\r\ndevelopment, their culture or their political system.\r\nThus, the universality of social problems and their\r\nseriousness then put social development in terms of\r\nurgent needs calling for concrete operational and realistic\r\nsolutions — solutions which, while they may vary in their\r\nimplementation, in the final analysis all stem from the\r\nsame vision and proceed from the same approach.\r\nIn spite of the major political changes around the\r\nworld, characterized, inter alia, by the end of the cold\r\nwar and the promising prospects for the settlement of\r\nseveral regional conflicts, and in spite of formidable\r\nadvances in science and technology, the fact remains that\r\nthe hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the\r\npositive results we had hoped for in the social sphere.\r\nMoreover, and paradoxically, the world has seen an\r\nunprecedented exacerbation of social problems.\r\nWhile it is true that responsibility for social\r\ndevelopment lies, first and foremost, with States\r\nthemselves, which have the right and duty to implement\r\nappropriate policies to achieve that objective, it is no less\r\ntrue that this responsibility must be assumed, in a spirit of\r\nsolidarity, by the international community as a whole, not\r\njust because of moral and political requirements that are\r\nbroadly shared today, but also because of the enlightened\r\nself-interest of us all. This new and welcome attitude is\r\nunequivocally reflected in the commitments entered into\r\nby our Heads of State in Copenhagen.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nThe existence of a favourable international\r\nenvironment is an essential prerequisite, even more\r\nnecessary than the means and resources that, subject to\r\nnational constraints, are available to States for their social\r\ndevelopment efforts. The impact and role of international\r\nfactors affect all countries’ prospects for social\r\ndevelopment, regardless of their level of economic\r\ndevelopment. However, they are decisive in the case of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nInformation provided both by the Secretariat and by\r\nspecialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture\r\nof where the phenomena of poverty, unemployment and\r\nsocial disintegration are most acute: the same places\r\nexperiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of\r\ntrade; protectionism; a fall in the prices of exported raw\r\nmaterials; and the drying up of financial flows. Many of\r\nour countries have seen their revenues dwindle, sometimes\r\nto a point where they can only afford to service their\r\nexternal debt — just at a time when the structural-\r\nadjustment policies and economic reforms that many of our\r\ncountries have had to implement are making living\r\nconditions for the poorest sectors worse and exacerbating\r\nunemployment, poverty and the absence of well-being.\r\nHowever, a consensus emerged in Copenhagen on the\r\nfact that poverty, unemployment and social disintegration\r\nare the true sources of social and political tension, and that\r\nthey are known threats to the stability of States and\r\ninternational peace, security and cooperation.\r\nTwo years on, with the exception of some steps taken\r\nby a few United Nations institutions, international\r\ncooperation is, unfortunately, still limited. While we\r\nwelcome the proclamation of 1997 as the International Year\r\nfor the Eradication of Poverty, it is essential that we make\r\nthe necessary resources available to achieve this\r\nfundamental objective of the Summit. To this end, and in\r\nthe framework of the reform of our Organization,\r\ndevelopment must once again be the central concern of the\r\nUnited Nations system since there is no better investment\r\nfor peace than the promotion of development.\r\nIn this spirit, the United Nations must look for the best\r\nways and means to make its activities in the area of social\r\ndevelopment more effective, including by strengthening\r\ncoordination between economic and social activities and\r\nimproving coordination with international financial\r\ninstitutions, since only through concrete and pragmatic\r\nprogrammes can our Organization get more out of the aid\r\nand assistance it provides to States for the establishment of\r\nsocial policies.\r\nIn Algeria the social dimension has always been at\r\nthe heart of development, since development is only\r\nviable if it fosters genuine social justice and that is based\r\non the values of humanism and national solidarity.\r\nThus, since its independence, Algeria has been\r\ncommitted to broad and far-reaching social\r\ntransformations that have helped us make considerable\r\nprogress in education, training, health, nutrition and\r\nemployment.\r\nSince independence, more than a third of the State\r\nbudget has been set aside for education, which is still free\r\nof charge from primary school to university. By way of\r\nillustration, 7.7 million Algerians are now in educational\r\ninstitutions, whereas at the time of independence there\r\nwere less than 100,000 students. Also by way of\r\nillustration, fewer than 1,000 Algerians were at university\r\nat the time of independence, as opposed to 400,000 today.\r\nHealth care, as always, still receives a substantial portion\r\nof State resources, and there is still no charge for\r\nmedicine in all hospitals and clinics in Algeria. Until last\r\nyear, the State also subsidized basic foodstuffs so that the\r\nmost disadvantaged sectors of society had to pay only a\r\nnominal price for them. Finally, since independence,\r\nmillions of public housing units have been built for the\r\npoorest sectors.\r\nAlgeria is keen to preserve what it has achieved, in\r\nspite of economic difficulties due to financial constraints\r\nand the requirements of economic and institutional\r\nrestructuring, which are designed firmly to put Algerian\r\nsociety on the path to progress and modernity through the\r\ncreation of a more efficient market economy and the\r\nestablishment of a pluralistic democratic society. This is\r\na particularly serious concern today because of the\r\ndifficulties inherent in the 10-year economic crisis and\r\nbecause of the new impetus that Algeria now hopes to\r\ngive to its development dynamic.\r\nAlgeria has committed itself fully to the success of\r\nthe Social Summit, and it has tried, since Copenhagen, to\r\ntake the necessary steps to honour its commitments by\r\ncreating, inter alia, an economic and social council, which\r\nis now a forum for dialogue and cooperation in economic,\r\nsocial and cultural spheres.\r\nThat Council comprises standing commissions,\r\nincluding a commission for the population and social\r\nneeds, which identifies and assesses the results of policies\r\nto cover social needs — policies for demographics,\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nemployment, training, income and national solidarity — for\r\nthe most disadvantaged socio-professional sectors.\r\nOther steps taken in accordance with the commitments\r\nentered into in Copenhagen have also been implemented.\r\nThese include the establishment of a social-development\r\nagency which, inter alia, is responsible for consolidating\r\nthe social safety net for the disadvantaged sectors of the\r\npopulation; establishing bank credit guarantees to help small\r\nand medium-sized enterprises in the area of employment\r\nand training of young persons; creating local social-service\r\nunits to strengthen follow-up and assessment; improving\r\nand restoring the social security system; and supporting the\r\nnetwork of associations and non-governmental bodies.\r\nSteps have also been taken to prevent exclusion and\r\nmarginalization, and a social dialogue, structured and\r\norganized by the State and working with all our social\r\npartners and employers, has helped us to reach major\r\nmilestones and convincing results.\r\nIt goes without saying that to be viable, this national\r\neffort must be backed up by a more favourable and fairer\r\ninternational economic environment that ensures the\r\nnecessary conditions for the consistent implementation of\r\neconomic reforms.\r\nCopenhagen has raised many hopes, but Copenhagen\r\ncan only change the daily lives of millions of people if\r\nwords become actions through the effective mobilization of\r\nthe international community. Our task is to find, through\r\nsolidarity and joint effort, the mechanism for a new\r\ndynamic of peace and cooperation. This Organization that\r\nbrings us together, can, if we wish, make it possible to set\r\nthat dynamic in motion. Let us begin the work, here and\r\nnow.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): The World Summit\r\nfor Social Development set in motion a process for a new\r\nglobal agenda for social and economic development. While\r\nscepticism abounds on the extent of implementation as we\r\nmark two years from the adoption of the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, we believe the\r\nSummit outcome remains a unique and unprecedented\r\nframework for promoting social development worldwide.\r\nThe General Assembly’s consideration of this item in\r\nplenary is testimony to its commitment to accord the\r\nhighest priority to the full implementation of the promises\r\nmade at Copenhagen.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport outlining the progress towards implementation of the\r\noutcome of the Summit at the national and international\r\nlevels. The Chairman of the Group of 77 has elaborated\r\nin detail our common concerns on this important item.\r\nWe would therefore like to flag some issues of specific\r\nrelevance to Bangladesh, and also share with this august\r\nbody our experience in keeping the promises we made at\r\nCopenhagen.\r\nWhile social development and the implementation of\r\nthe commitments made at the Summit are primarily the\r\nresponsibility of national Governments, it is also\r\nrecognized that without international cooperation and\r\nassistance such implementation will not be possible. The\r\ncore issues of poverty eradication, employment generation\r\nand social integration cannot be credibly addressed\r\nwithout adequate resources, access to trade and\r\ntechnology and a conducive external environment. In this\r\ncontext, the needs of the least developed countries can\r\nhardly be overemphasized. Despite the pledges made, the\r\nlevel of effective development cooperation and financial\r\nassistance remains far from adequate. Thus it is\r\nimperative to mobilize resources, including new and\r\nadditional funds, to reinforce the efforts of the developing\r\ncountries — in particular the least developed countries —\r\nto implement the outcome of the Summit.\r\nWe are encouraged to note that the Economic and\r\nSocial Council at its substantive session in July this year\r\ncalled for further efforts towards this end, in line with the\r\nrecommendations of the Summit. We have also noted\r\nwith satisfaction some of the concrete efforts being made\r\nby the United Nations system in the context of a\r\ncoordinated follow-up to the Summit outcome. These\r\ninclude some initiatives by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), particularly in the\r\ncontext of micro-finance sectors as a tool for poverty\r\nalleviation, self-employment and social integration. The\r\ncreation of the Department for Economic and Social\r\nAffairs to assist in the implementation of the follow-up to\r\nthe Summit is an important decision, which we hope will\r\nlead to more coordinated and focused implementation and\r\nfollow-up efforts at the United Nations.\r\nOur own experience with micro-credit programmes\r\nalong the model of the Grameen Bank has demonstrated\r\ntheir viability as an effective tool for poverty eradication,\r\nand for achieving other goals of socio-economic progress\r\nand the empowerment of women and other disadvantaged\r\ngroups. The Social Summit recognized the role of micro-\r\ncredit mechanisms for poverty eradication. Resolutions\r\nadopted at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly\r\nand at the thirty-fifth session of the Commission for\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nSocial Development emphasized the need to support micro-\r\ncredit efforts as a tool for poverty eradication and self-\r\nemployment of women.\r\nEarlier this year, in February, the first ever micro-\r\ncredit summit was held in Washington, D.C., to highlight\r\nthe effectiveness of micro-credit institutions and\r\nprogrammes for poverty eradication and empowerment of\r\nthe poor. The Micro-credit Summit Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action launched a campaign aimed at\r\nbringing 100 million people out of poverty by the year\r\n2005, and we would urge the international community to\r\ngive its full support to the implementation of this greater\r\ngoal for social development and empowerment of the poor.\r\nIn this context, we would like to underscore the need\r\nto intensify efforts at the national level to strengthen and\r\nestablish micro-credit institutions as a strategy for poverty\r\neradication and social development. We urge the\r\ninternational community to lend its full support and\r\nassistance to micro-credit institutions and micro-lending\r\nprogrammes. We also urge the United Nations agencies to\r\ninternalize micro-credit in their programmes for poverty\r\neradication and social development.\r\nAs a follow-up to the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, Bangladesh has established a national\r\ncommittee to formulate a coordinated national programme\r\nof action to implement the outcome of the Summit. The\r\nMinistry of Planning has been designated as the focal point\r\nfor implementation of the Summit outcome. In the\r\ncountry’s fifth five-year plan (1997-2002), a pro-poor plan\r\ninvolving all relevant sectors has been integrated.\r\nFurthermore, legislative measures are being undertaken to\r\nintegrate social development programmes into the activities\r\nof local government bodies.\r\nThe promotion of social development through poverty\r\neradication, employment generation and human resources\r\ndevelopment remains the cornerstone of our national\r\ndevelopment efforts. With a view to implementing an\r\nintegrated strategy for social and economic development,\r\nour development policy and programmes are formulated\r\nwithin the framework of broad targets for social\r\ndevelopment, aimed at meeting the basic needs of the\r\npopulation and increasing self-reliance. A major share of\r\nthe development budget goes to the social sector, with\r\nhighest priority given to education, health and family\r\nplanning. Our strategies for social development include\r\nspecial programmes for enhancing the status of women,\r\nchildren, youth, the disabled, the aged and other\r\ndisadvantaged groups. Full participation and equality of\r\nminorities and other marginalized groups are also priority\r\nobjectives of our social integration and development\r\nefforts. And in all our national endeavours for social\r\ndevelopment, we have as our active partners non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and other actors from civil\r\nsociety.\r\nThe allocation for social sectors in the National\r\nDevelopment Programme for 1997-98 is 37 per cent, far\r\nexceeding the Social Summit goal of 20 per cent in\r\naccordance with the 20/20 concept. Social indicators point\r\nto notable improvements in some social sectors as a direct\r\nresult of the priority being attached to social development.\r\nAt the regional level, the South Asian Association\r\nfor Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has also undertaken\r\na poverty-alleviation programme aimed at a coherent,\r\nintegrated approach to addressing hard-core poverty at the\r\ngrass-roots level.\r\nWe are encouraged to note the initiatives being\r\nundertaken by the regional commissions to implement the\r\noutcome of the World Summit. In this context, we would\r\nlike to stress further the concrete support and assistance\r\nof the regional commissions for national and subregional\r\nefforts to implement the Summit’s outcome.\r\nThere is a pressing need to harmonize our efforts\r\nand resources for social development. Bangladesh\r\nsupports an effective machinery in which the United\r\nNations system as a whole could be involved in the\r\nfollow-up process. The role of the United Nations should\r\nbe essentially supportive. Key impetus, however, must be\r\nprovided by the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nWith political resolve and commitment, nothing can\r\nstop the momentum generated at Copenhagen. The\r\nCopenhagen Summit refocused attention on urgent\r\npriorities for social development. It is up to us to renew\r\ntoday our commitment to the full realization of the goals\r\nof the Summit for Social Development and to the\r\nbetterment of our society.\r\nMr. Seguro (Portugal): The United Nations\r\nEconomic and Social Council, at its meeting on 23 July\r\n1997, unanimously adopted a decision to hold the first\r\nWorld Conference of Ministers for Youth in Lisbon from\r\n8 to 12 August 1998. The Conference will be organized\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nin cooperation with the United Nations, and all Member\r\nStates are invited to attend.\r\nThe purpose of the World Conference is to broaden\r\nthe debate on youth-related issues within the framework of\r\nthe United Nations system, improving and implementing the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000\r\nand Beyond.\r\nIt is the Portuguese Government’s view that the First\r\nWorld Conference of Ministers for Youth should not reopen\r\nthe discussion of the text adopted by the General Assembly\r\non 14 December 1995. Rather, it should focus on reviewing\r\nand evaluating the way in which Governments, in\r\ncooperation with young people and concerned\r\nintergovernmental organizations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system, have implemented the measures\r\nrecommended in the Programme of Action at the national,\r\nregional and local levels.\r\nIt should also set new guidelines for the effective\r\nenforcement of the Programme of Action, itemizing specific\r\nmeasures to solve problems which, although common to\r\nother sectors, are especially rife among young people —\r\neducation and participation, unemployment, health and drug\r\naddiction.\r\nThe first World Conference of Ministers for Youth is\r\nbeing carefully prepared to promote cooperation between\r\nGovernments and all who are involved in youth-related\r\nissues around the world. In this regard, I would like to\r\nemphasize the open and participatory manner in which the\r\nfirst series of consultations took place over the past three\r\ndays, and I take this opportunity to express my thanks and\r\nrecognition to all those who were present at those\r\ndiscussions.\r\nThe Lisbon Conference is seen as a new organizational\r\napproach, and it will be the first time in the Organization’s\r\n50-year history that the topics to be covered have been\r\nbroached at this level. Another innovative aspect will be the\r\ncreation of a forum at the opening of the Conference so\r\nthat, young people can express their views.\r\nWhile it is important to act with determination and\r\ncaution, on the one hand, it is, on the other, vital to know\r\nhow to innovate by implementing mechanisms that can\r\nsupport emerging models, consolidating the global and\r\nintersectoral dimension of youth policies in close\r\ncoordination with national, regional and local authorities\r\nwhile not ignoring the various social actors, including\r\nyoung people.\r\nBy hosting this World Conference, Portugal aims to\r\ncreate a forum for solidarity among all who are striving\r\nto improve the lifestyle and opportunities of young\r\npeople. It is our wish to follow a course leading to\r\ntangible cooperation at the local, national, regional and\r\nglobal levels.\r\nThis is why we give due credit to the work being\r\ncarried out in each country and to that of the specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations, as well as to the actions\r\nbeing undertaken by the various cooperation\r\norganizations, both governmental and non-governmental.\r\nIt is with this in mind that we are following up on the\r\nwork performed by several regional conferences of\r\nministers.\r\nWe are also closely monitoring the proposals\r\nadvanced by young people and by the organizations\r\nrepresenting them, for it is our view that youth policies\r\nmust benefit from the participation of the young\r\nthemselves.\r\nWe are set to make the Lisbon declaration a vital\r\ninstrument, one that includes tangible measures\r\nresponding to such problems as unemployment, drug\r\naddiction, health care, education and participation. A final\r\ndeclaration that is no more than a letter of intent filled\r\nwith noble principles is clearly not what is required. We\r\naim to reach much higher. We seek definite and concrete\r\nproposals. It is our ambition to find, together with all the\r\ncountries involved, a path leading to new prospects.\r\nOf the world’s population, 18 per cent is 15 to 24\r\nyears old, and we all know that millions of these young\r\npeople live in subhuman conditions. Many of them are\r\npoverty-stricken, others do not enjoy good health and\r\nmany are unemployed.\r\nMillions of young people throughout the world do\r\nnot have a definite target in life because our societies do\r\nnot allow them, in practice, to put into action the\r\nfundamental rights embodied in our Magna Carta\r\ndocuments. We are fully aware that the lives of those\r\nyoung people will not change on the day after the\r\nConference ends, but we do believe that the Lisbon\r\ndeclaration will give rise to cooperation that will\r\nincreasingly and progressively improve their lives.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nWe therefore call for one and all — Governments, the\r\nUnited Nations, non-governmental organizations, agencies,\r\nintergovernmental organizations, institutions and young\r\npeople — to commit themselves to and participate in the\r\nFirst World Conference of Ministers for Youth.What we\r\npropose is to accomplish a solid block of work to contribute\r\nsignificantly to fighting unemployment, poverty, drug\r\naddiction and disease. With that in mind, Portugal will be\r\nhosting next year the ninth Ibero-American Conference of\r\nMinisters for Youth, the first Conference of Ministers for\r\nYouth of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, the World Youth\r\nFestival and the third session of the World Youth Forum of\r\nthe United Nations system, which is being prepared by the\r\nPortuguese National Youth Council.\r\nI would like to end by reaffirming what I said in\r\nGeneva last July. It is important that the Ministers for\r\nYouth work together under the aegis of the United Nations\r\nto ensure the improved social and professional integration\r\nof young people.\r\nWe believe in a global, concerted youth policy.\r\nClearly, we can speak nowadays not of a typical youngster,\r\nbut of youngsters who, while sharing the same problems,\r\nexperience quite diverse social and cultural realities.\r\nOn behalf of the Portuguese Government, we offer our\r\nhospitality, our experience and our determination in\r\norganizing the First World Conference of Ministers for\r\nYouth, in cooperation with the United Nations. We do not\r\nwant the World Conference to act as a balm to our\r\nconsciences. We want the World Conference to stress the\r\nvalues of peace, liberty, tolerance and respect for human\r\nrights. We want the World Conference to include youth\r\npolicies among the priorities of the world’s political agenda.\r\nWe want to give young people reasons to believe once\r\nmore.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (interpretation from French):\r\nSpeaking on agenda item 46 on the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development, the\r\ndelegation of Tunisia, while endorsing the statement made\r\nby Tanzania on behalf of the Group of 77 and China,\r\nwishes to make its own contribution to our debate here\r\ntoday. I wish to focus my statement on the key elements of\r\nthe implementation, both at the national and international\r\nlevels, of the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit, in\r\nanticipation of the special session of the General Assembly\r\nin the year 2000 for an overall review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of this outcome.\r\nThe first point I wish to address in this regard\r\ninvolves international action to follow up the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. My delegation believes\r\nthat international cooperation for social development is a\r\nnecessary complement to activities undertaken by our\r\ncountries in a world increasingly dominated by the\r\nglobalization of the economy, which has not only benefits\r\nfor the future of our planet, but also potentially negative\r\nconsequences for development, and in particular could\r\nexacerbate the inequalities between countries and, within\r\ncountries, between individuals.\r\nMy delegation feels that any action in this respect\r\nmust aim principally at reducing overall poverty and\r\neradicating absolute poverty, expanding employment and\r\nreducing unemployment — goals contained in the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, as\r\nwell as in General Assembly resolution 51/202, adopted\r\nlast year.\r\nWith respect to the fight against poverty, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the actions undertaken to that end by\r\nthe United Nations system — particularly the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund and the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund — and acknowledges their efforts to elaborate\r\nnational strategies in the campaign against poverty and to\r\nimplement the 20/20 concept.\r\nAs concerns the “second-stage” action for social\r\ndevelopment — the fight against unemployment and its\r\ndestructive effects on social cohesion and stability,\r\nparticularly in the developing countries — my delegation\r\nwelcomes the particular interest demonstrated by United\r\nNations agencies in this subject, as manifest in the\r\nimportance attached to achieving the goal of full\r\nemployment by the International Labour Conference in\r\n1996 and by the Commission for Social Development,\r\nmeeting in early 1997. We feel, however, that any\r\ninternational cooperation in this area must aim first and\r\nforemost at reversing the effects of social upheaval caused\r\nby an increasingly integrated world economy.\r\nInternational follow-up activities to the World\r\nSummit for Social Development must mobilize the entire\r\ninternational community in a spirit of solidarity and\r\neffectiveness in support of the efforts and sacrifices made\r\nby the developing countries in this sphere. It must be\r\nrecognized, however, that the action currently being\r\nundertaken by the developed countries and the United\r\nNations system is far from commensurate with the\r\nproblems being faced by many countries, a great many of\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nwhich are African. This inadequacy can be seen at the\r\nlevels of official development assistance and investment and\r\nin the treatment of the debt problem.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation endorses the\r\nrecommendations contained in resolution 51/202, which\r\nstresses the need to mobilize additional financial resources\r\nand more effective development cooperation and assistance.\r\nIn this spirit, it is essential and urgent that the\r\ninternational community strive for the fulfilment of the\r\nagreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product\r\nof developed countries for overall official development\r\nassistance as soon as possible, and an increase in the share\r\nof funding for social development programmes\r\ncommensurate with the scope and scale of activities\r\nrequired to achieve the objectives and goals of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the\r\nProgramme of Action of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nSimilarly, we believe that it is important for the\r\ndeveloped and developing countries to allocate, on average,\r\n20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per\r\ncent of the national budget, respectively, to basic social\r\nprogrammes.\r\nAs regards debt, a genuine obstacle to development for\r\nmany countries of the South, my delegation supports any\r\ninitiative aimed at finding effective, fair, lasting and\r\ndevelopment-oriented solutions to the problem of foreign\r\ndebt and debt-servicing faced by the developing countries.\r\nAs for the new and innovative ideas for mobilizing\r\nfunds to meet the commitments and priorities adopted by\r\ncommon consensus at the United Nations summits and\r\nconferences, as contained in the Secretary-General’s report\r\non the outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, we feel that they can neither replace official\r\ndevelopment assistance nor go to finance the regular or\r\npeacekeeping budgets of the United Nations. The search for\r\nnew and innovative solutions for mobilizing funds must\r\nalso fall within a larger perspective if additional resources\r\nfor financing development cooperation are to be released.\r\nOur Heads of State and Government recognized that\r\nsocial development and the implementation of commitments\r\nundertaken at Copenhagen fell first and foremost to the\r\nGovernments themselves, even if international cooperation\r\nand assistance were essential to the full achievement of that\r\nobjective.\r\nIn this spirit, and in accordance with resolution\r\n51/202, which reiterates the appeal made to Governments\r\nat the Summit to elaborate national plans of action to\r\nfollow up the Summit, I am pleased to recall the major\r\nefforts my country has already made in this area.\r\nTunisia’s pioneering and innovative achievements in this\r\nfield have in more than one instance been reinforced by\r\nthe decisions made by the international cooperation in the\r\nframework of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nIn this regard, my country has far exceeded the figure\r\nagreed upon in Copenhagen of 20 per cent of the national\r\nbudget for social spending.\r\nTunisia’s social development activities are ambitious\r\nand multidimensional; they are the cornerstone of our\r\nnational policy to ensure well-being and prosperity for all\r\nour people. In particular, we have a progressive policy for\r\nthe promotion of women, who are true partners in\r\ndevelopment; and an innovative policy to ensure that our\r\nchildren flourish, which can be seen in our adoption of a\r\ncode to protect the rights of the child, as well as the\r\nestablishment of a national commission to that end.\r\nAnother fundamental element in our national\r\ndevelopment strategy is the promotion of national social\r\nsolidarity in our efforts to combat exclusion. This has led\r\nto the establishment of the National Solidarity Fund, one\r\nof our recent measures for the achievement of human\r\ndevelopment in Tunisia. Established in 1992 on the\r\ninitiative of the President of the Republic, Mr. Zine El\r\nAbidine Ben Ali, the Fund is designed to finance\r\ninitiatives to help people in low-income social categories\r\nand urban areas lacking minimum basic infrastructures.\r\nThe Fund is financed through several sources, in\r\nparticular, through voluntary contributions from citizens\r\nand businesses and grants from the State budget.\r\nIn 1993 a permanent commission for the Solidarity\r\nFund was set up to define, with the help of central and\r\nregional administration services, criteria for identifying\r\npriority areas and to follow, with those services, the\r\nimplementation and progress of projects. Six basic needs\r\nhave been identified: roads, drinking water, electrification,\r\neducation, health and housing. In addition, among other\r\nthings, there is a need for cultural centres, youth centres\r\nand sanitation, and to combat desertification.\r\nIn 1994 the Fund was entrusted with improving\r\nemployment and income levels in the target areas and\r\nwith rooting people to their lands and their areas of\r\norigin. This entails helping to create and consolidate\r\nsources of income.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nBetween 1993 and 1996 the National Solidarity Fund\r\nprovided 35,160 homes with electricity and over 60,382\r\nwith drinking water. It enabled the building or improvement\r\nof 8,796 houses and the construction of 1,565 kilometres of\r\nroads and tracks, 75 schools and 71 health centres. To date,\r\nthe number of projects financed by the Fund has reached\r\n1,865, and 140,000 families have benefited.\r\nThe Fund has had a favourable impact on the\r\npopulations concerned and on public opinion. It was\r\ntherefore decided to set up a more ambitious national\r\ndevelopment programme lasting from 1995 to 2000, to\r\ncover all the areas of need.\r\nIn order to strengthen its development activities, the\r\nNational Solidarity Fund became a State Secretariat\r\nwithin the Government in 1996. In addition, a Tunisian\r\nSolidarity Bank has been established on the initiative of\r\nthe President of the Republic. Its main role will be to\r\ncreate micro-projects to provide stable funding in areas\r\nwhere the National Solidarity Fund is active, so as to put\r\nthe finishing to the promotion of those areas. We feel that\r\nthis new initiative responds perfectly to the spirit of the\r\nrecommendations of the Copenhagen Summit, to which\r\nTunisia remains firmly committed.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
