(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 46 (continued)\r\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/305)\r\nMr. Mahugu (Kenya): At the outset, Sir, I wish to\r\njoin the previous speakers in commending you for the able\r\nmanner in which you continue to preside over the work of\r\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation would like to associate itself fully with\r\nthe views expressed by the Permanent Representative of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China on this agenda item. I should also like to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his report entitled\r\n“Implementation of the Outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development” (A/52/305), and we look forward to\r\nthe report on poverty eradication (A/52/315).\r\nThe adoption of the Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction during the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nheld at Copenhagen in March 1995, was a milestone\r\ntowards the eradication of poverty, an increase in\r\nproductive employment and the enhancement of social\r\nintegration. The presence of so many world leaders at the\r\nSummit underscored the importance placed on social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy delegation fully supports the efforts made by the\r\nUnited Nations in facilitating the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nKenya attaches great significance to the implementation\r\nof the Economic and Social Council\u0027s agreed conclusions\r\non “Fostering an enabling environment for development:\r\nfinancial flows, including capital flows, investment and\r\ntrade”, as adopted at the Council\u0027s recent high-level\r\nsegment. We urge the timely implementation of the\r\nCouncil\u0027s recommendations on the eradication of poverty.\r\nWe welcome the notable steps undertaken so far by the\r\nfunctional commissions, in particular the Commission for\r\nSocial Development and the Commission on the Status of\r\nWomen, in coordinating the implementation of the\r\nCouncil\u0027s recommendations on the multiyear programmes\r\nrelating to poverty eradication.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations operational\r\nactivities for development should be strengthened. We\r\nurge the United Nations Development Programme to\r\ncontinue coordinating efforts by the United Nations\r\nsystem towards capacity-building for social development\r\nprogrammes at the national level.\r\nWhile social development and the implementation of\r\nthe commitments made at Copenhagen are primarily the\r\nresponsibility of Governments, international cooperation\r\nis essential to ensure the full implementation of these\r\ncommitments. In this regard, Kenya underscores the\r\nimportance of a partnership approach at the national,\r\nregional and international levels. In order to enhance full\r\nand effective implementation of the broad-based\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ncommitments of the Summit, there is an urgent need for the\r\ninternational donor community, including the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, to provide the new and additional\r\nresources needed to finance the projects and programmes,\r\nparticularly those designed to hasten the eradication of\r\npoverty.\r\nAs a follow-up to the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, the Government of Kenya, in collaboration\r\nwith the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,\r\nhas prepared a comprehensive policy framework paper\r\noutlining the development strategies during the current\r\nNational Development Plan for the period 1997-2001. The\r\npaper is designed to enhance conditions conducive to\r\nsustained economic growth and development. These\r\ninclude: the maintenance of macroeconomic stability; the\r\nimprovement of efficiency in the public sector; the\r\npromotion of the private sector as an effective engine of\r\neconomic growth for development; and addressing the\r\nsocial aspects of development through targeted poverty\r\ninterventions for the vulnerable groups.\r\nI should like to conclude by reiterating the importance\r\nmy Government attaches to the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action as agreed at the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development. Towards this end,\r\nmy delegation believes that without the timely and effective\r\nsupport of the international community, these efforts will\r\nhave limited impact. Kenya therefore seeks the support of,\r\nand partnership with, the donor community, the private\r\nsector and the beneficiaries in enhancing the speedy\r\nimplementation of the goals and objectives of the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action of the World\r\nSummit.\r\nMr. Valle (Brazil): It is with particular satisfaction\r\nthat I take the floor on item 46, “Implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development”. At\r\nthe outset, I should like to associate my delegation with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Tanzania on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China, as well as with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Paraguay, who spoke on\r\nbehalf of the Rio Group.\r\nIt has now been more than two years since Heads of\r\nState or Government and representatives from all of our\r\ncountries gathered in Copenhagen to deliberate about\r\nmatters as essential to the future of humankind as the\r\neradication of poverty, the expansion of productive\r\nemployment and social integration. Since then, many things\r\nhave happened at the international, regional and national\r\nlevels that are conducive to the implementation of the\r\ndecisions taken in Copenhagen.\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report presents many\r\nexamples of how different countries in different parts of\r\nthe world are tackling the challenging issue of social\r\ndevelopment. Also, the report of the Secretary-General\r\nreflects the efforts that have been put forward by the\r\nUnited Nations system to comply with the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action.\r\nAs I mention the Copenhagen Summit, it is only\r\nappropriate that at this stage I recall and recognize the\r\nimportant role of the Permanent Representative of Chile,\r\nAmbassador Juan Somavía, a key player in this major\r\nendeavour ever since its inception, to whom we express\r\nour appreciation and gratitude.\r\nTurning to the international sphere, I would like to\r\npoint out the important work that has been carried out by\r\nthe Commission for Social Development as the body\r\nwithin the Organization primarily responsible for follow-\r\nup and review of the implementation of the Summit\u0027s\r\nrecommendations. In accordance with its multi-year\r\nprogramme, the Commission considered during its most\r\nrecent session, in February this year, the key issue of\r\nproductive employment. The Commission agreed that the\r\nexpansion of full, productive, appropriately and\r\nadequately remunerated and freely chosen employment\r\nmust be a central object of economic and social policies.\r\nOf equal importance will be the theme on which the\r\nCommission will focus its attention during its next\r\nmeetings: the promotion of social integration and the\r\nparticipation of all people, including disadvantaged and\r\nvulnerable groups and persons, in the benefits of social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt the regional level, it is with a great sense of\r\naccomplishment that I want to highlight the fact that the\r\nLatin American and Caribbean region has organized,\r\nthrough the Economic Commission for Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean, the first regional conference in follow-up\r\nto the World Summit, which Brazil was honoured to host\r\nin the city of Sao Paulo last April. This was a valuable\r\nopportunity for countries of the region to present reports\r\non measures taken to implement the commitments made\r\nand to exchange views on how to proceed in order to\r\nattain the goals set forth in Copenhagen. The Sao Paulo\r\nConsensus adopted by the Conference renews the region\u0027s\r\ncommitment to give priority to the issues on the social\r\nagenda, to incorporate social equity into economic\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ngrowth, to ensure the necessary allocation of resources to\r\nprojects with a social impact, to strengthen cooperation with\r\nall sectors of civil society, to ensure an integrated approach\r\nto the economic, social and environmental dimensions of\r\ndevelopment and to establish a regional database of\r\nsuccessful social projects, among other goals.\r\nWhile recognizing that international cooperation and\r\nassistance are essential for the full implementation of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, my\r\ndelegation is very well aware of the primary role that\r\nGovernments and civil society must play at the national\r\nlevel towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth. For\r\nBrazil, the generation of employment and income is an\r\nessential part of economic and social development. It is,\r\nabove all, a major factor in the fight against poverty, which\r\nis one of the main concerns of the Brazilian Government.\r\nThe economic stability experienced by Brazil since the\r\nintroduction of the Real Plan has already contributed to the\r\nalleviation of the situation of a large portion of our poor\r\npeople. We recognize, however, that important challenges\r\nremain before us, and we call for urgent action.\r\nThe State alone cannot meet all the challenges of\r\nequitable and sustainable development. The participation of\r\nall actors from civil society is much needed and greatly\r\nwelcome. Taking into account the potential of civil-society\r\norganizations as agents of change and partners in\r\ndevelopment and poverty alleviation, the Brazilian\r\nGovernment has created an innovative mechanism,\r\nComunidade Solidaria — Community in Solidarity —\r\nwhich constitutes a privileged space for building\r\npartnerships, for proposing new forms of joint ventures and\r\nfor mobilizing people and institutions. Through\r\nComunidade Solidaria, Government and civil society have\r\njoined to implement projects in areas such as professional\r\ntraining and income generation, food and nutrition, the\r\nreduction of infant mortality, primary education, basic\r\nsanitation and urban and rural development.\r\nComunidade Solidaria is a clear example of Brazil\u0027s\r\nbelief that by joining forces it will be possible to build a\r\nbetter world for the future generations, a world free from\r\nthe plagues of hunger, absolute poverty and social inequity,\r\nwhere human dignity and solidarity will prevail: the world\r\nthat was envisaged by Heads of State or Government\r\ngathered at Copenhagen in 1995.\r\nMr. Takht-Ravanchi (Islamic Republic of Iran): The\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development was a manifestation\r\nof the continuing drive at the global level towards achieving\r\na better common understanding of the various elements\r\ninvolved in the social development of modern societies.\r\nIt was also the culmination of collective international\r\nefforts over the past several decades in that direction. The\r\nSummit deserves to be revisited here, albeit in a very\r\ngeneral and succinct manner. As underlined in the\r\nopening paragraph of the Copenhagen Declaration, Heads\r\nof State or Government recognized the significance of\r\nsocial development and human well-being for all.\r\nMoreover, they committed themselves — and hence the\r\ncountries they represented — to give to these goals the\r\nhighest priority both at the time of the Summit and into\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the social\r\nsituation at the global level as the reason for convening\r\nthe Summit, the Declaration reckoned that there existed\r\nan urgent need to address profound social problems,\r\nespecially poverty, unemployment and social exclusion,\r\nand that our societies must respond more effectively to\r\nthe material and spiritual needs of individuals, their\r\nfamilies and their communities. The Declaration also\r\nreiterated that democracy and transparent and accountable\r\ngovernance and administration in all sectors of society are\r\nindispensable foundations for the realization of social and\r\npeople-centred sustainable development, which were in\r\nturn considered to be predicated on peace, security and\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nThe Summit\u0027s future-oriented outlook, as reflected in\r\nthe Declaration\u0027s principles and goals, was a commitment\r\nto a political, economic, ethical and spiritual vision for\r\nsocial development, which, in addition to the principles I\r\nhave just referred to, called for full respect for the various\r\nreligious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of\r\npeople. Within this overall conceptual construct, the\r\nSummit resolved to create a framework for policy and\r\naction at the national, regional and international levels\r\ngeared to the promotion of social progress, justice and the\r\nbetterment of the human condition.\r\nWhat we all agreed to at Copenhagen, and what we\r\nall promised to undertake thereafter, was lofty by any\r\nstandard. Now, almost three years after the Summit, we\r\nare here to assess the outcome of the Social Summit and\r\nto see, albeit in a preliminary manner, how it has been\r\nimplemented. To this end, a report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, contained in the document A/52/305, has been\r\npresented to the General Assembly at its current session;\r\nwe find it find useful and appreciate it. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report indicates the wide range of activities and\r\ninitiatives undertaken within the framework of the United\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nNations system or scheduled to take place in various fields\r\nand various forums.\r\nThe very fact that such an amount of activity and\r\ninitiative is reported by the Secretary-General points to the\r\nsystem\u0027s degree of concern for and attention to the\r\nSummit\u0027s outcome, and is hence a cause for hope and\r\noptimism. While we look forward to the work of the\r\nCommission for Social Development at its upcoming thirty-\r\nsixth session and to the 1998 substantive session of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, we await with great\r\nanticipation the special session of the General Assembly in\r\nthe year 2000 and express our most sincere wishes for the\r\nsuccess of the process leading to that special session —\r\nand, of course, for a much fuller implementation of the\r\nSummit outcome and a much better social situation the\r\nworld over.\r\nThe annex to the Secretary-General\u0027s report, dealing\r\nwith initiatives of national Governments on the follow-up\r\nto the Summit, is also a useful compendium of information.\r\nIt shows how different Governments at various stages and\r\nlevels of development have responded to the Summit\u0027s\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. It is also indicative\r\nof the fact that quite a wide variety of Governments have\r\ntaken the Summit\u0027s outcome seriously and have paid\r\nattention to the necessity to implement it. This too is a\r\ncause for hope and optimism.\r\nTurning from the general to the specific, let me briefly\r\ntouch upon our own national situation. As indicated in the\r\nannex to the report under consideration, Iran is among the\r\n110 Governments which have reported on national actions\r\nin implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit and\r\namong the 40 Governments that have described in detail\r\ntheir national actions. A summary of Iran\u0027s activities\r\nappears in paragraph 22 of the annex to the report.\r\nI would like simply to underline here that in response\r\nto the Summit\u0027s call, a national focal point for the\r\neradication of poverty was designated in 1996. Moreover,\r\na bill detailing an overall plan for the eradication of poverty\r\nhas been drawn up by the Government and presented to the\r\nparliament for consideration and approval.\r\nThe summary of our national report, as reflected in the\r\nannex just referred to, can provide a glimpse of the Iranian\r\nGovernment\u0027s approach to social development. Available\r\ndata on the indices of social development in various fields\r\nand areas, as reported by such United Nations agencies as\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nUnited Nations Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF) and the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), among others, clearly\r\nattest to the Government\u0027s commitment to the betterment\r\nof the social situation in general, and to the poor and the\r\ndisadvantaged in particular. General improvement over the\r\npast several years in most social indicators is also\r\nindicative of the overall success of the Government\u0027s\r\nefforts in this regard. In the aftermath of the recent\r\npresidential elections in Iran, we expect to see a higher\r\ndegree of attention to and emphasis on social\r\ndevelopment, not only on the part of the Government but\r\nalso through more pronounced popular participation by\r\ncivil society.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that the subject before\r\nthe Assembly is indeed very important and so huge in\r\nextent that it defies satisfactory treatment in just the few\r\nminutes available. Much more remains unsaid, whether on\r\npolicy and actions at the national level or at the regional\r\nand international levels.\r\nMr. Mangoaela (Lesotho): During the general\r\ndebate, my Minister for Foreign Affairs had occasion to\r\nexpress his congratulations to you on your election.\r\nToday, I do this on behalf of the member States of the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC). In\r\ndoing so, I offer you their sincere congratulations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-second session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Let me also extend my\r\ncongratulations to the other members of the Bureau. We\r\nwish to assure you of the full cooperation of the SADC\r\nmember States in the discharge of the heavy responsibility\r\nentrusted to you. We would also like to express our\r\nthanks to Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia for the\r\nable manner in which he guided the work of the fifty-first\r\nsession. SADC would also like to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan for his deserved election as Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations and for the skilful manner in which he\r\nis carrying out his responsibilities.\r\nI have the honour to address this Assembly on\r\nagenda item 46, entitled “Implementation of the outcome\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development”, on behalf\r\nof the SADC member States, namely: Angola, Botswana,\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mauritius,\r\nMozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,\r\nSwaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia,\r\nZimbabwe, and my own country, Lesotho.\r\nAt the outset, SADC would like to associate itself\r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nWe also welcome the report of the Secretary-General\r\non “Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development” (A/52/305) and his report on the\r\n“First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty” (A/52/315).\r\nAs we turn yet another page after the historic adoption\r\nof the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action,\r\nwe should ask ourselves whether there has been any change\r\nin the plight of the millions of people living in abject\r\npoverty, any employment creation or any favourable change\r\nin the international economic environment.\r\nAs we approach the five-year review and the new\r\nmillennium, we regret that there has been no marked\r\nimprovement of the situation of the world\u0027s poorest since\r\nCopenhagen. Regrettably, important initiatives before and\r\nafter Copenhagen which could have accelerated the\r\ndecisions taken there have not been implemented. And\r\nunfortunately there has been a steady increase in the\r\nnumber of people living in deplorably poor conditions. The\r\nworld can never be a peaceful place as long as more than\r\nhalf of the world\u0027s populace is living in abject poverty.\r\nThe polarization between the “haves” and the “have\r\nnots” is increasing, threatening societies and world security.\r\nIt is therefore imperative that social development should be\r\na global priority. In Africa, for example, we have a lot of\r\nintra-State conflicts that have their roots in the scarcity of\r\nresources. The core issues of the Social Summit — poverty\r\nalleviation, employment generation and social integration —\r\nmust therefore continue to be the main focus of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe southern African region is drought-prone. The\r\nhigh probability of the reoccurrence of drought in the\r\n1997-1998 period due to the re-emergence of the El Niño\r\nphenomenon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and its\r\nadverse impact on food production, is of great concern to\r\nSADC. We therefore appeal to the United Nations and to\r\nthe international community to respond generously to the\r\ndrought situation in southern Africa in order to avert famine\r\nin the region, especially by supporting the region\u0027s drought\r\npreparedness and management strategies, through\r\nstrengthening the capacity to deal with the situation,\r\ndrought monitoring, and early warning preparedness.\r\nAppropriate assistance should also be extended to the\r\nSADC water sector, and to SADC member States, in order\r\nfor them to advance further the implementation of the\r\nprotocol on shared water course systems and preparedness\r\nfor the SADC water sector round-table conference\r\nscheduled for October 1998.\r\nFor developing countries, particularly in Africa,\r\npoverty is aggravated by their debt burden, widespread\r\nunemployment, a deepening environmental crisis, the lack\r\nof adequate development aid and globalization, with its\r\nnegative effects on trade for developing countries.\r\nThere is an urgent need to free developing countries\r\nfrom their debt burden — particularly the 33 sub-Saharan\r\nAfrican countries which are classified among the least-\r\ndeveloped countries. These countries need to rehabilitate\r\ntheir economic infrastructure and to fund social\r\nexpenditure. Unfortunately, their scarce resources are used\r\nfor debt payments. We reiterate the need for the\r\ninternational community, including the international\r\nfinancial institutions, to continue exploring ways of\r\nimplementing additional and innovative measures to\r\nreduce the debt burden of developing countries, in\r\nparticular the highly indebted low-income countries.\r\nGlobalization and liberalization are economic\r\nprinciples on which we all agree; however, they are not\r\nends in themselves. The benefits of globalization and\r\nliberalization continue to elude people in the developing\r\ncountries, especially in Africa. SADC member States\r\nbelieve that for globalization and liberalization of the\r\nworld economy to benefit all countries, developing\r\ncountries must have free access to world markets without\r\nany conditions.\r\nThe mobilization of new and additional financial\r\nresources that are both adequate and predictable is\r\nessential in order to implement the commitments made in\r\nCopenhagen, especially with regard to commitment 2 on\r\nthe eradication of poverty. In this respect, SADC member\r\nStates are encouraged by the continuous international\r\npartnership developing within the region. SADC calls for\r\nurgent fulfilment of the previously agreed United Nations\r\ntargets of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product\r\n(GNP) of the developed countries for overall official\r\ndevelopment assistance, with 0.15 per cent to the least\r\ndeveloped countries. Our developed partners should also\r\nstrive to increase, as soon as possible, the share of\r\nfunding for social development programmes,\r\ncommensurate with the scope and scale of activities\r\nrequired to achieve the objectives and goals of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to the 20/20 initiative.\r\nFurthermore, we are aware that the Oslo consensus on the\r\n20/20 initiative called for its review within two years. We\r\nare informed that preparations are progressing for the\r\nfollow-up meeting next year in September. SADC\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ncountries are eagerly awaiting the outcome of this meeting,\r\nwhich would provide us with an opportunity to review how\r\nthe compact has been implemented and to rededicate our\r\ncommitment to it.\r\nWe accept that the primary responsibility for\r\nimplementation of the Copenhagen outcome lies with\r\nnational Governments. However, we believe that to achieve\r\nthe objectives of the Copenhagen Declaration and the\r\nProgramme of Action, Governments have to initiate their\r\nefforts with the support of the United Nations, the\r\nmultilateral financial institutions, regional organizations and\r\nall actors in civil society.\r\nThe United Nations has a responsibility to facilitate\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the Summit. In this\r\nregard, we commend the action taken so far by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment, other functional commissions, the United\r\nNations Secretariat and the funds, programmes and\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. Of note is the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme-supported project\r\non social exclusion. We hope that the results of the study\r\nwill be inculcated in the work of the funds and programmes\r\nto ensure that the anti-poverty strategies become more\r\neffective. Related to this, we wish to express our regret that\r\nthe Economic Commission for Africa has not held a\r\nregional meeting at a high political level to review the\r\nprogress made towards implementing the outcome of the\r\nSummit, as invited by the General Assembly in resolutions\r\n50/161 and 51/202.\r\nFurthermore, we regret that while a number of\r\nimportant initiatives have been launched, such as the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s, the System-wide Plan of Action for African\r\nEconomic Recovery and Development, the United Nations\r\nSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa and the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development, held\r\nunder the auspices of the Government of Japan, which\r\ncould have accelerated the decisions taken, the\r\nimplementation of some of these initiatives is very slow.\r\nWe believe that for the developing countries to\r\nachieve any meaningful and lasting progress, the\r\ninternational economic situation should be conducive to\r\ndevelopment. It is imperative that international cooperation\r\nfor development be strengthened. In our view, unregulated\r\neconomic growth does not promote equity, employment or\r\nthe sustainable use of natural resources. We are anxious\r\nthat the growing globalization of the world economy might\r\naggravate the unemployment situation unless precautions\r\nare taken. In our view, there is therefore a need to\r\nredirect the overall economic system towards putting\r\nsustainable human development at the centre if we are to\r\nimplement commitment 3, made at the Summit, to\r\npromote\r\n“the goal of full employment as a basic priority of\r\nour economic and social policies”. [Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration on Social Development, annex I]\r\nOur national Governments are involved in the\r\nfollow-up to the Summit. National policies on poverty\r\nhave been formulated by some Governments in our\r\nregion, while others have designated local focal points.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to share information on some\r\nof the actions that the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) has taken to improve human\r\ndevelopment and meet the goals of the people in our\r\nregion. These efforts were focused on poverty alleviation,\r\nemployment expansion and social integration. SADC held\r\na conference in Windhoek, Namibia, from 6 to 8\r\nDecember 1996. The theme of the conference was “the\r\nprivate sector stake in southern African development”. In\r\nthis regard, we would like to thank the sponsors of the\r\nconference, which included the Governments of Japan and\r\nthe United States. SADC regards the private sector as the\r\nengine of growth and development. In our view, the\r\nprivate sector holds the key to creating more jobs and\r\ngenerating income. The conference was held to enable\r\nsouthern African business leaders to interact more freely\r\nand exchange views and experiences with their Japanese\r\nand American counterparts.\r\nSADC held another conference in Windhoek from 8\r\nto 10 February 1997. The theme of that conference was\r\n“productivity: key to sustainable development in SADC”.\r\nThe conference was meant to afford Governments, the\r\nprivate sector and the labour movement an opportunity to\r\nexchange views and practical experiences so as to devise\r\na common action plan to improve productivity in the\r\nSADC region, all towards implementing the conclusions\r\nof the Copenhagen Summit.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): I should like to begin by\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his informative report\r\n(A/52/305) on this agenda item on the implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. Let me also express appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Mahmoud Jabir, of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania, who spoke earlier on behalf of the Group of 77\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nand China, and fully associate my delegation with that\r\nstatement.\r\nTwo years ago the international community committed\r\nitself to addressing the imperative questions of poverty,\r\nunemployment and social exclusion. A pragmatic and\r\nfeasible framework for action was agreed on, which was\r\nfully within the capacity of the Member States to achieve.\r\nIndonesia remains steadfastly committed to achieving those\r\nobligations assumed at Copenhagen and to realizing the\r\nsubstantial alleviation and eventual eradication of poverty\r\nin the near future.\r\nWe recognize that progress in social development has\r\nbeen made. Health care, education and general standards of\r\nliving have risen for many people in recent decades. But\r\ntoo little progress is being made today for the more than a\r\nquarter of the developing countries\u0027 populations that\r\ncontinue to live in deprivation, poverty and misery. As we\r\ndeliberate today, an estimated 1.3 billion people survive on\r\nless than the equivalent of $1 a day. Indeed, many do not\r\nsurvive. The benefits of globalization and the rapid\r\nadvances in science and technology that have dramatically\r\ntransformed international economics have yet to resolve the\r\nunderlying problems of poverty, and in fact have driven\r\nmany developing countries into marginalization. The poor\r\nbecome poorer and the gap between rich and poor grows\r\nwider.\r\nWhile the primary responsibility for addressing these\r\nproblems rests at national level, a responsibility that we in\r\nIndonesia willingly accept, it does not obviate the need for\r\ninternational assistance to developing nations, or for\r\ninternational cooperation in ensuring a stable, open and\r\nexpanding global economy. As the developing countries\r\nstrive to implement their social development policy, they\r\nshould not at the same time be impoverished by a global\r\neconomic system in which they have little voice. We need\r\nto act, and we need to act in genuine partnership in the\r\nknowledge that lifting the poor into sustainable\r\ndevelopment benefits the world economy at large.\r\nIf we are to seriously comply with the commitments\r\nmade at the World Social Summit, then I am compelled to\r\nunderline the imperative need to mobilize new and\r\nadditional financial resources that are adequate and\r\npredictable. We must restore the commitment to official\r\ndevelopment assistance, on which most developing\r\ncountries rely, but which is unfortunately in sharp decline,\r\nhaving now reached its lowest level since the adoption of\r\ntargets over 25 years ago. This downward trend must be\r\nreversed and we must strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7\r\nper cent of gross national product (GNP) for overall\r\nofficial development assistance. At the same time,\r\nIndonesia supports convening an international conference\r\non financing for development, which we believe would\r\nlend additional commitment to this important issue. Let\r\nme add that we found encouraging, and welcomed, the\r\ncomments made by the European Union earlier today with\r\nregard to mobilizing resources for development,\r\nparticularly towards the goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP\r\nofficial development assistance. Through partnership and\r\ncooperation we will all reap rewards.\r\nI must say, however, that little progress will be made\r\nif for every step forward we take two back. A “once and\r\nfor all” solution to the debt burdens that prevent many\r\ndeveloping countries from directing adequate resources\r\ninto social development must be made, and that a solution\r\nmust be without conditionalities. In this regard, the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank\r\nshould be implemented, so as to assist the poorest\r\ncountries in resuming economic growth and development.\r\nI find it encouraging that following the World\r\nSummit the level of Government and public interest in the\r\nglobal employment situation increased substantially. As\r\nnearly one third of the global workforce is estimated to be\r\nunemployed, we must now move beyond expressions of\r\ninterest and begin initiating measures for real progress.\r\nUltimately, poverty will not be overcome in the absence\r\nof employment, employment cannot be created without\r\neconomic expansion, and for the developing countries in\r\ntoday\u0027s world this demands international cooperation and\r\nsupport for their development goals. Therefore, while we\r\nlook to the Secretary-General, within the framework of\r\nUnited Nations system-wide coordination, to broaden and\r\ndeepen the policy debate on this issue, we must\r\nconcurrently move forward with those agreements made\r\nin Copenhagen.\r\nI believe it was timely that at its high-level segment\r\nlast July the Economic and Social Council undertook a\r\nreview of “Fostering an enabling environment for\r\ndevelopment: financial flows, including capital flows,\r\ninvestment and trade”. It is noteworthy that the agreed\r\nconclusions adopted by the Council indicated that an\r\ninternational enabling environment called for broadening\r\nand strengthening the participation of developing\r\ncountries in international economic decision-making.\r\nIndonesia considers it essential that, as a multilateral,\r\nuniversal and democratic Organization, the United Nations\r\nshould not see its centrality in the promotion of economic\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ngrowth and development diminished; it is also essential that\r\nit play a guiding role in the management of globalization.\r\nWithin the United Nations we must continue to work\r\nto ensure that follow-up activities to the Summit are well-\r\ncoordinated and harmonized with those agendas set by other\r\ninternational conferences for economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The Commission for Social Development,\r\ntogether with the Administrative Committee on\r\nCoordination, should ensure that such activities are\r\nappropriately integrated. In this connection, I welcome the\r\nnew structure of the agenda and multi-year programme of\r\nwork of the Commission for Social Development for the\r\nyears 1997-2000, having the follow-up to the World\r\nSummit for Social Development as its substantive theme.\r\nIn concluding, let me say that while Indonesia will\r\ncontinue to make comprehensive efforts at the national level\r\nto translate the outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment into genuine social progress, we will also\r\ncontinue vigorously to advocate a fair and equitable\r\nposition for the developing countries within the\r\ninternational community. We will continue to seek a\r\nconsensus for development for all, and a dialogue for\r\npartnership that will evenly distribute the fruits of\r\nglobalization. It is our sincere hope that when the United\r\nNations conducts the overall review and appraisal of the\r\nSummit outcome in the year 2000 many of these goals,\r\nparticularly those concerning poverty eradication, will have\r\nbeen met.\r\nMs. Romulus (Haiti) (interpretation from French):\r\nFirst of all, I would like to stress that my delegation\r\nsupports the statement made by the representative of\r\nTanzania on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nAware of the range and complexity of the social\r\nproblems facing the human race, especially poverty,\r\nunemployment, social inequality and social insecurity,\r\nHeads of State and Government committed themselves in\r\nCopenhagen in March 1995 to adopting national policies in\r\nthe framework of the objectives of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development.\r\nWe ventured to hope that this will shown by the\r\ncommunity of nations would usher in a new era of well-\r\nbeing for peoples.\r\nCloser to home, the first regional conference on the\r\nfollow-up to the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nheld in São Paulo, Brazil, testified to the resolve of the\r\nregion\u0027s leaders to take the measures required to attain the\r\nobjectives agreed at Copenhagen in a spirit of solidarity.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its concern as\r\nto implementation of the commitments entered into at\r\nCopenhagen, namely, to improve our populations\u0027\r\nstandards of living. At the same time, I shall take this\r\nopportunity to describe the measures taken by my\r\nGovernment in this area.\r\nEveryone knows how alarmed the people of Haiti\r\nwere at the speed with which social structures were\r\nfalling apart, given the period of crisis my country has\r\njust experienced — a period of uncertainty which caused\r\na succession of problems for the economy and reputation\r\nof Haiti. We also have to recall that, because of the socio-\r\npolitical problems, unemployment has continued to rise,\r\nwhich further compounded the difficult economic\r\nsituation of vulnerable groups in a country which already\r\nhad a very disturbing level of unemployment.\r\nTo put an end to this vicious circle, despite all kinds\r\nof trials and tribulations, the Government of Haiti\r\nundertook to lead the nation on the path to the improved\r\nstandard of living it had been awaiting for too long. The\r\nresults are seen in the policy to combat poverty, create\r\nlasting foundations for the rule of law and freedom and\r\ntackle the structural causes of absolute poverty, which is\r\nthe stark reality of the everyday life of three-quarters of\r\nthe population of Haiti.\r\nThe programme to eliminate poverty will be backed\r\nup by a three-year economic programme to encourage\r\nrenewed economic activity to generate employment,\r\nparticularly for the most vulnerable sectors of the\r\npopulation. This reconstruction work, which has\r\ninternational backers, involves the establishment of a\r\nstable political and economic environment favouring\r\nrenewed growth and the restoration of vital sectors such\r\nas education, health and the environment. The framework\r\nof the macro-economic policy for growth and human\r\ndevelopment was based on the clear needs of the people\r\nof Haiti and the United Nations resolutions in this area.\r\nThe Government of Haiti has placed particular\r\nemphasis on the development of national production;\r\nbased on a concept put forward by our Head of State,\r\nMr. René Préval, this is the guiding principle of\r\nGovernment action. The first phase of agricultural reform,\r\nlaunched by the Government on 1 May, has already borne\r\nfruit. The estimated yield of the land that was distributed\r\nis exceptionally good, significantly exceeding the average\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ntraditional yield of 2.8 metric tonnes per hectare. It is clear\r\nthat this new experiment will have a significant economic,\r\nsocial and political impact over the short-, medium- and\r\nlong- term.\r\nAt the economic level, we can expect a sharp increase\r\nin national production, which the Government has already\r\nset as our top priority. The communities benefiting from\r\nthis will thus be equipped with what they need to face the\r\ntest of the market and the enormous challenges of\r\nrestructuring.\r\nAt the social level, experts foresee the emergence of\r\na new category of people whose purchasing power will\r\nenable them to be fully integrated into national and\r\ninternational economic life.\r\nOn the question of health, the Government has\r\nundertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on\r\nunder the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and\r\nPopulation and to replace the traditional vertical approach\r\nwith a more effective, regionally integrated strategy based\r\non providing a minimum service, estimated to cost 2 per\r\ncent of gross domestic product a year. Institutional reforms\r\nare under way to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of\r\nPublic Health and Population.\r\nIn this complex process of the profound transformation\r\nof all of Haitian society, education plays an active part by\r\ndisseminating scientific and technical knowledge and raising\r\nthe population\u0027s level of awareness. Everyone has a right to\r\neducation.\r\nIn a society which is striving for development,\r\nilliteracy is an obstacle that must be overcome at any cost;\r\nthat is a prerequisite for true social progress. Education is\r\ntherefore the central concern of Haiti\u0027s leaders, as the\r\nnecessary path to change and social progress.\r\n“Literacy”, the Secretary-General told us on\r\nInternational Literacy Day,\r\n“is a bridge from misery to hope. It is a tool for daily\r\nlife in modern society. It is a bulwark against poverty\r\nand a building block of development, an essential\r\ncomplement to investment in roads, dams, clinics and\r\nfactories.”\r\nHaiti\u0027s State department responsible for literacy, created a\r\nfew years ago and directed by career educators, is doing\r\noutstanding work in the most remote areas of our country.\r\nThere is no doubt that we must have a more human vision\r\nand begin thinking of those who have been left out, in\r\norder to develop their talents and creativity through\r\neducation.\r\nTime does not allow me to enumerate all the points\r\nof our Government\u0027s admittedly ambitious programme,\r\nwhich include the consolidation of peace and democracy,\r\nthe preservation of our endangered environment, the fight\r\nagainst drugs, the promotion of human rights and, above\r\nall, the emergence of the Haitian people from abject\r\npoverty into a more human life of dignity.\r\nEliminating poverty, creating productive employment\r\nand achieving social integration are immense tasks that\r\nexpand every day. Most fortunately, we were able to see\r\nduring the general debate at the fifty-second session, a\r\nnew approach, marked by greater respect for what is\r\nhuman, a policy of support for democracy and a desire\r\nfor proper appreciation of human potential, the catalyst\r\nfor development. This is encouraging and gives grounds\r\nfor hope.\r\nHaiti, while seeking its right road in the political,\r\neconomic and social domains, reiterates its solidarity with\r\nthe various United Nations initiatives to encourage the\r\nleaders of the world to alleviate the problems facing all\r\nthe inhabitants of the planet.\r\nMr. Campbell (Ireland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMs. Arystanbekova (Kazakhstan) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment was an important milestone in the history of\r\nthe international community, and was universally\r\nrecognized as a forum that made a major contribution to\r\ndealing with the acute social problems facing the human\r\nrace.\r\nAt the same time, the proposed solutions require\r\nfurther implementation, and, indeed, adaptation to the\r\nrealities of the economic situation. We think it important\r\nto improve on implementation of the commitments\r\nentered into by Governments, and to stimulate active\r\ninternational cooperation and an exchange of positive\r\nexperiences, in order to ensure full implementation.\r\nEqually important is the question of mobilizing financial\r\nresources in order to implement the Social Summit\u0027s\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the report (A/52/305) made\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\navailable to us under today\u0027s agenda item, “Implementation\r\nof the outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment”. The information and recommendations\r\ncontained in the report are important and useful in aiding us\r\nto choose the best possible ways of dealing with the\r\nproblems of productive employment and sustainable\r\nlivelihoods, which are our priorities this year.\r\nWe learned with interest of the measures described in\r\nthe report which have been applied recently by Member\r\nStates, the Commission for Social Development and the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat, as part of follow-up activities.\r\nThey undoubtedly make a real contribution to implementing\r\nthe goals set at the Copenhagen Summit. In this connection,\r\nwe would like to express Kazakhstan\u0027s support for the\r\nefforts designed to further study and resolve problems at all\r\nlevels.\r\nThe Government of Kazakhstan, for its part, is taking\r\nconsistent steps towards implementing the commitments\r\nentered into at Copenhagen, particularly in the areas of\r\nproductive employment and sustainable livelihoods.\r\nKazakhstan is committed to the ideal of renewal and\r\nis carrying out radical economic changes which are\r\nprimarily designed to enhance the standard of living of our\r\npeople. A solution to the problems facing us today will to\r\na great extent help determine how effectively and\r\nconsistently we are able to implement these measures in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe Government of Kazakhstan is taking measures to\r\nradically reform and improve enterprises, achieve\r\nprivatization, and strengthen the private and financial\r\nsectors. Unfortunately, as well as having a positive impact\r\non the country\u0027s economy, these measures have led to a\r\ndrop in employment levels, which remains a factor today.\r\nIn this connection, the Government of Kazakhstan is\r\ncarrying out comprehensive measures to improve\r\nentrepreneurship at the individual level, the family level and\r\nthe micro and small business level. We are also organizing\r\nsocial works, primarily in housing and road construction.\r\nRecognizing the stabilizing role of small businesses in\r\nsolving problems of productive employment, our\r\nGovernment is stepping up work in support of small\r\nenterprises at the State level, on the basis of decrees of the\r\nPresident, in order to develop a comprehensive programme\r\nin this area.\r\nWe are also trying to deal with the problem of\r\nfinancial support for small businesses and are establishing\r\na fund for development. We are also establishing a system\r\nof benefits for small enterprises. In order to establish an\r\nappropriate legal foundation, the Republic of Kazakhstan\r\nadopted a law on State support for small business and on\r\nindividual entrepreneurship. The question of State credit\r\nfor small enterprises is taken into account in credit\r\nagreements between the Republic\u0027s National Bank and the\r\ninternational financial organizations of which Kazakhstan\r\nis a member. The Government of Kazakhstan is also\r\nadopting measures to support small businesses by\r\nstimulating their development, as a result of which the\r\nnumber of such businesses has risen to 150,000, and there\r\nhas been a significant increase in the goods and services\r\nthey produce.\r\nAnother factor in productive employment for our\r\npeople is housing, which is essential.\r\nThe Republic of Kazakhstan has a development\r\nstrategy which extends to the year 2030. The President\r\nrecently made a statement to our people about this,\r\nestablishing our basic priorities and directions for\r\ndevelopment over the short and longer term. One of the\r\nmost important priorities is combating poverty and\r\nunemployment. The Government\u0027s basic efforts focus on\r\nmicro-credit and developing small and medium-sized\r\nbusinesses; the high-priority development of labour-\r\nintensive sectors of our economy; actively attracting\r\nforeign investment and domestic capital; and\r\nstrengthening the services sector.\r\nIn this connection, beginning in 1998 our\r\nGovernment plans to provide microcredit, primarily to\r\nthose citizens most in need of it, both at the family level\r\nand at the level of small and medium-sized businesses,\r\nfarmers and other sectors in which more jobs can be\r\ngenerated. We believe that those measures are in keeping\r\nwith the recommendations contained in General Assembly\r\nresolutions 50/161 and 51/202, which stress the\r\nimportance of encouraging national initiatives for social\r\ndevelopment, including credit and microcredit.\r\nAs our Republic has shifted to a market economy,\r\nwe have seen the need to make radical changes in our\r\nearlier policies to provide social protection to our\r\npopulation, set priorities for the transition period and\r\nwork out a conceptual approach for the future. At present\r\nwe are concentrating on measures of social protection\r\nfocused on need, assisting those who for reasons beyond\r\ntheir control are unable to provide the basic minimum\r\nneeds for themselves and their families. In order to do\r\nthis, the Government of Kazakhstan has adopted a\r\nnumber of laws and other regulations setting forth specific\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nmeasures and mechanisms for resolving the population\u0027s\r\nmost urgent social problems.\r\nAt the same time, the root problem of reforming the\r\nsocial-support system for our people involves financing,\r\nand, given the limited resources available, the Republic\r\nfaces the task of developing new social programmes in\r\nresponse to the changes in our society in order to try to\r\npreserve viable social-support systems for our people. Here\r\nwe are confronted with serious social problems related to\r\nthe large-scale ecological disasters in the Aral Sea region\r\nand around the former nuclear-test site at Semipalatinsk.\r\nKazakhstan\u0027s cooperation with international financial\r\norganizations and United Nations funds and programmes\r\ncontinues to provide us with assistance in implementing the\r\nCopenhagen Programme of Action. We appreciate the\r\nsupport of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) in issuing the Republic\u0027s national report in the\r\nhuman development index. We are also grateful for\r\nassistance to women\u0027s programmes and for UNDP activities\r\nin microfinancing for individuals or self-employed persons\r\nor for the social integration of groups not otherwise covered\r\nunder certain systems. For example, with UNDP support we\r\nhave a programme to make microcredit available to women\r\nin one of our districts.\r\nThe delegation of Kazakhstan supports the conclusions\r\nof the Commission for Social Development as set forth in\r\nits resolution 34/2, which contains a set of agreed\r\nconclusions on productive employment and sustainable\r\nlivelihoods, which are a part of the follow-up to the Social\r\nSummit. Kazakhstan fully supports the goals and principles\r\nof the Declaration on Social Development and Programme\r\nof Action of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nGiven our concern for the well-being and standard of\r\nliving of our peoples, these are the priority areas in which\r\nwe in Kazakhstan are working and carrying out basic\r\nreforms while at the same time dealing with the problems\r\ncreated by the transition period. It would be unrealistic for\r\nus to expect a speedy attainment of our goals, but we\r\nbelieve that, against this background, active assistance from\r\nUnited Nations programmes and funds and from\r\ninternational financial institutions to countries whose\r\neconomies are in transition will be extremely helpful for\r\nresolving problems and achieving goals in this area,\r\nincluding those we have set for ourselves in Kazakhstan.\r\nMs. Aponte de Zacklin (Venezuela) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): While fully endorsing the statement made by\r\nthe delegation of Paraguay on behalf of the Rio Group, the\r\ndelegation of Venezuela would like to raise a few points\r\nthat are of interest to it from a national point of view.\r\nFrom the time of the Copenhagen Summit to date,\r\nthe international community has maintained an ongoing\r\ndialogue to promote social development. Today more than\r\never, we are united by the challenge of implementing the\r\ncommitments made at Copenhagen within the overall\r\nframework of the indisputable ethical principles and\r\nvalues that underlie the Declaration on Social\r\nDevelopment and Programme of Action of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development.\r\nThe threefold approach adopted at the Summit — to\r\neradicate poverty in the world, promote the goal of full\r\nemployment as a basic priority and achieve social\r\nintegration — lies at the heart of the agendas of Member\r\nStates. However, national, regional and international\r\nefforts have not yet succeeded in transforming the social\r\nsituation of today\u0027s world, which is marked by major\r\ndisparities in income and by the extreme poverty that\r\naffects the lives of billions of human beings.\r\nWe are aware that the issue of social development\r\ncannot be separated from the major transformations taking\r\nplace today at the political, economic and cultural levels\r\nand that, therefore, any answers must be based on a\r\nrealistic view of the social situation and the economic\r\ncircumstances of development.\r\nIn this connection, if we are to overcome the\r\ndisparities and well-known inequities in the distribution of\r\nthe benefits of economic trends — liberalization at the\r\nnational level and globalization at the international\r\nlevel — it is imperative that we reach a better\r\nunderstanding of those trends and muster the necessary\r\npolitical will to prevent such disparities and a possible\r\nmarginalization of some countries in the world market.\r\nOur country strongly supports all the activities in\r\nwhich the United Nations has been engaged to promote\r\ndevelopment, particularly the General Assembly\u0027s\r\nadoption in June 1997 of the Agenda for Development,\r\nwhich, as the Secretary-General noted in his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization, tackles not only the usual\r\ndevelopment issues but also\r\n“stresses the mutually supportive though complex\r\nrelationships among development, peace, democracy,\r\ngood governance and human rights.” [A/52/1, para.\r\n44]\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nWe also consider, the strategies discussed at the\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council, on everything\r\nrelated to the mobilization of financial resources to\r\nstrengthen national efforts to deal with poverty, to be of\r\nspecial interest for developing countries.\r\nIn recent years Venezuela has taken a series of steps\r\ndesigned to improve its abilities to manage social policies,\r\npromoting a comprehensive State-wide reform that\r\nincorporates elements to modernize the public sector and\r\nthe decentralization and transfer of power to regional and\r\nlocal governments.\r\nIn April 1996 the President of the Republic,\r\nMr. Rafael Caldera, announced a set of measures he felt\r\nwere needed to ensure the country\u0027s stability during\r\neconomic recovery. Thus, he introduced “Agenda\r\nVenezuela”, which contained a comprehensive and coherent\r\nset of policies that include programmes of macroeconomic\r\nstabilization, institutional reforms, social benefits and\r\nproductive restructuring.\r\nThe component of social benefits reflects the political\r\nwill of the national Government to distribute the social\r\nburden of the adjustment programme among the entire\r\npopulation and to compensate those groups that tend to\r\nsuffer the most from these types of measures. This is also\r\npart of the effort made by our Executive to follow up the\r\ncommitments adopted at the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThere are two main elements to this component. Those\r\nprogrammes are to be strengthened that are most likely to\r\nhelp the most destitute groups and that are already fully\r\nimplemented, in order to avoid investing too much time in\r\nthe design and creation of such programmes. Existing\r\nprogrammes are to be used that have proven to be effective\r\nin channelling resources to the neediest groups.\r\nAgenda Venezuela contains a set of 14 social\r\nprogrammes involving direct food aid and financial\r\nassistance, as well as training to reintegrate people into the\r\nworkforce, job creation programmes, food subsidies,\r\nmedical help and others. While social policy of this kind\r\nshould resolve the most serious priority problems, it should\r\nalso help social development as a whole and teach the kind\r\nof behaviour that will lead to a life in greater dignity and\r\nin keeping with the needs of our times.\r\nThe most important aspect of Agenda Venezuela is the\r\nmanner in which it addresses the social impact of economic\r\nmeasures. As our President recently said:\r\n“Our Government is socially aware and recognizes\r\nworkers\u0027 demands for higher salaries to offset the\r\nrise of the cost of living.”\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to say that Venezuela\r\nrecognizes that change is most important for the present\r\nand future of the country. Through these processes, we\r\nare therefore attempting to enhance the basic concepts\r\nthat will lead to the political, social and institutional\r\nmodernization of Venezuela.\r\nMr. Jayanama (Thailand): On behalf of the Thai\r\ndelegation, I would like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive report on the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development,\r\ncontained in document A/52/305. The report is an\r\nencouraging account of the significant progress achieved\r\nin the implementation of the commitments made at the\r\nCopenhagen Summit in 1995 by all involved, including\r\nnational Governments, the Secretariat itself, the Economic\r\nand Social Council, regional commissions and other\r\nmembers of the United Nations system, including the\r\nWorld Bank, as well as civil society. While Thailand\r\nbelieves that social development and the implementation\r\nof the Copenhagen commitments are primarily the\r\nresponsibility of national Governments, we recognize that\r\ninternational cooperation and assistance are essential for\r\ntheir full implementation.\r\nMy delegation believes that regional commissions in\r\nparticular have a significant and catalytic role to play in\r\nreviewing national progress achieved and regional actions\r\ntaken in the implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nof the Copenhagen Summit. Thailand therefore welcomes\r\nthe Fifth Asian and Pacific Ministerial Conference on\r\nSocial Development, which will be convened by the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP) in Manila from 5 to 11 November 1997.\r\nWe look forward to participating actively in the exchange\r\nof experiences in national and regional progress in the\r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit and in the consideration of means of accelerating\r\nthe implementation of the regional agenda at the national\r\nand regional levels.\r\nLast year in this Assembly, Thailand reported on its\r\nprogress towards the implementation of the outcome of\r\nthe Copenhagen Summit, as contained in the current\r\nreport of the Secretary-General. This year, we would like\r\nto take the opportunity to elaborate further on these\r\nefforts.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nThe accelerated economic growth Thailand has\r\nenjoyed in the past decade has not been without cost.\r\nEconomic growth and material progress have not meant that\r\nall Thai people are enjoying proportionately greater wealth\r\nand a substantially improved quality of life. Rapid\r\neconomic growth has also had certain negative effects on\r\ntraditional Thai ways of life and societal values. The Office\r\nof the National Economic and Social Development Board\r\ntherefore believes that development strategy should take\r\ninto consideration the overall human impact.\r\nThailand therefore agrees with the importance of the\r\npeople-centred approach to development put forward by the\r\nCopenhagen Summit, which emphasizes that development\r\ncannot be sustained in the long run if it is based only on\r\npurely physical economic growth, without due consideration\r\nof human and other social and environmental dimensions.\r\nIn line with this thinking, Thailand has integrated the\r\nobjectives of the Summit into our Eighth Economic and\r\nSocial Development Plan (1997-2001), adjusting the\r\ndevelopment concept from a purely economic growth\r\norientation to a people-centred development. Befitting this\r\npeople-centred approach, the Plan was the result of\r\ncollaborative efforts on behalf of the entire population of\r\nThailand. Thai people from all walks of life and from\r\nvarious regions of the country played their part in drafting\r\nthis Plan from its inception.\r\nThe Eighth Plan is a response to a national vision of\r\nThai society, a vision which cuts across all aspects of\r\nhuman experience to provide a comprehensive picture of\r\ndevelopment as it should be. In this vision, people will\r\ndevelop themselves, their natural environment and\r\neconomy, as well as improve good governance, to provide\r\nthe highest sustainable level of well-being possible for all.\r\nThailand is committed to fulfilling this vision,\r\nwhereby every Thai person should have greater\r\nopportunities to develop his or her full potential physically,\r\nspiritually and intellectually, and every Thai child should\r\nhave adequate access to quality health care, with the\r\nassurance of good nutrition from birth, and access to at\r\nleast 12 years of basic education. Young people, age 18 to\r\n24, should have opportunities to participate in higher\r\neducation. All disadvantaged people should have access to\r\neducation and employment. All Thai citizens must have the\r\nopportunity to receive good quality basic social services.\r\nThe Thai people should be better equipped to adapt to the\r\nchanges brought about by rapid progress in science and\r\ntechnology, in order to cope more effectively with\r\ninternational competition. In addition to achieving sustained\r\ngrowth and stability without compromising environmental\r\nand social aspects, the Thai economy will provide job\r\nopportunities and more equitable income distribution\r\namong all groups of people in all regions of the country.\r\nThe quality of life in the provinces and rural areas should\r\nnot be inferior to that in the capital. Natural resources\r\nwill be properly managed on a sustainable basis for the\r\nbenefit of future generations of Thai people.\r\nA few days ago, a new Thai Constitution, adopted in\r\nParliament by an overwhelming majority, entered into\r\nforce. Even more than the Eighth Development Plan, this\r\nConstitution was directly drafted by elected\r\nrepresentatives of a balanced cross-section of Thai\r\nsociety. It should therefore strengthen and reinforce the\r\nThai Government\u0027s plans to enhance social development.\r\nFor instance, it focuses strongly on human rights and\r\nincludes clauses against sexual, social or racial\r\ndiscrimination. For the first time in Thailand\u0027s history we\r\nhave a Constitution which has a separate section on\r\npeople\u0027s rights based on the general principle of\r\npreserving and promoting the rights and dignity of the\r\nindividual. This provides a firm foundation for fulfilling\r\nour commitment to the promotion of social progress,\r\njustice and the betterment of the human condition.\r\nAs called for by the Copenhagen Summit, we agree\r\nthat poverty eradication is of utmost concern to all\r\ncountries. But for Thailand, the benefits of economic\r\ndevelopment have yet to be more evenly distributed\r\nacross our society. From 1988 to 1996, the number of\r\npeople living in poverty in Thailand decreased by 12 per\r\ncent. Yet those still living in poverty can become a source\r\nof social and economic disruption in our society.\r\nWe know from past experience that to alleviate\r\npoverty, close collaboration through a holistic people-\r\ncentred approach by all actors of society is needed. Thus,\r\nthe Thai Government, Thai civil society and the United\r\nNations family in Thailand — including the World\r\nBank — have jointly established the Thailand/United\r\nNations Collaborative Action Plan, which is primarily a\r\nframework aimed at supporting the implementation of the\r\ndecentralized, people-centred development objectives of\r\nthe Eighth Plan, in which the question of poverty\r\nalleviation is emphasized. In this regard, Thailand is\r\ncommitted to reaching the target of reducing the\r\nproportion of people living below the poverty line in\r\nThailand to less than 5 per cent by the year 2020.\r\nWithin this joint initiative, the Royal Thai\r\nGovernment has called on the United Nations system in\r\nThailand — including the World Bank — to collaborate\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\non developing an action strategy for poverty alleviation.\r\nThe Thai/United Nations Collaborative Action Plan strategy\r\nseeks to focus on a range of key opportunities available to\r\ngovernment for addressing poverty and identifying practical\r\nsolutions. The strategy also proposes the piloting of a few\r\nselected programmes which could be undertaken through\r\nthe partnership of the Thailand/United Nations\r\nCollaborative Action Plan, involving government, the\r\nUnited Nations non-governmental organizations, the private\r\nbusiness sector and academia working together.\r\nThe Action Strategy begins with measures representing\r\na set of possible early priority interventions, including land\r\ntitle reform; a new agricultural development initiative and\r\nspecial agricultural economic zones; promotion of new\r\nmanufacturing investment through relocation of labour-\r\nintensive industries to create industrial estates in the region;\r\nintroduction of modern and appropriate technologies;\r\nmarketing systems; and human resource development,\r\nincluding improved skills.\r\nBased on an analysis of the situation of poverty in\r\nThailand, and taking into account a few critical issues\r\nwhich are at the root of poverty, including such areas as\r\nlack of land security, severely limited access to essential\r\nresources and inputs, low opportunities for non-farm\r\nenterprises, and lack of basic education, skills and\r\ntechnologies, the action strategy proposes a focus on the\r\nfollowing 10 key opportunity areas for addressing poverty\r\nin Thailand: building the capacities of people in\r\ncommunities to manage poverty-alleviation programmes; a\r\nbottom-up and participatory approach involving the active\r\nengagement of local people at each stage; removing\r\nremaining obstacles to the structural transformation of the\r\neconomy; new agricultural technologies, agricultural parks\r\nand labour-intensive rural infrastructure; supporting small-\r\nbusiness development and income-generation for the urban\r\npoor and for households that want to move out of\r\nagriculture; investment in labour-intensive manufacturing in\r\nor near rural areas; improvement of formal education; skill-\r\ndevelopment training; potable water; addressing issues of\r\ndrug and human trafficking; enhancing the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of public assistance programmes; and\r\nincreasing the level of public expenditures on poverty\r\nalleviation.\r\nWe believe that the Thailand/United Nations\r\nCollaborative Action Plan is a landmark partnership for\r\npeople-centred development. Thailand would like to express\r\nits gratitude and appreciation to all involved in it, especially\r\nthe United Nations system in Thailand, including the World\r\nBank. We would also urge other developing countries to\r\nconsider such a unique framework. We believe it could be\r\nan important model for development cooperation in the\r\ncoming decade.\r\nPeople-centred development and eradication of\r\npoverty are two vital elements of the outcome of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit. The Summit called on all of us to\r\ndefine time-bound goals and targets for reducing overall\r\npoverty and eradicating absolute poverty. Thailand fully\r\nsubscribes to this noble goal of the Summit and is trying\r\nits best to positively and efficiently answer this call.\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana): The World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen in August 1995,\r\nbrought into sharp focus the profound nature of\r\nunderdevelopment in the world and created a sense of\r\nurgency for mobilizing energies and resources at the\r\nnational and international levels to implement strategies\r\nto eradicate poverty, promote full employment and foster\r\nsocial integration as a basic policy priority.\r\nIndeed, since the beginning of this decade, each of\r\nthe global conferences which have been organized under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations — from the Children\u0027s\r\nSummit, held in 1990, to the Conference on Human\r\nSettlements, held in Istanbul in 1996 — has drawn a link\r\nbetween its own central theme and the pervasive issue of\r\npoverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed.\r\nThe agreements reached at these major conferences, and\r\nparticularly at the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nnow provide the basis for concerted and sustained action\r\nagainst poverty.\r\nIn December 1995 the General Assembly initiated a\r\ndebate on the outcome of the World Summit. This is\r\ntherefore the third time running that this item has been\r\ninscribed on our agenda, underlining the importance that\r\nwe attach to the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nConference. In this connection, my delegation fully\r\nendorses the statement made by the United Republic of\r\nTanzania on behalf of the Group of 77 and China on this\r\nitem. We also commend the Secretary-General for the\r\nreports he has submitted to facilitate our discussion of the\r\nitem.\r\nMy delegation is gratified by the measures which\r\nhave been taken so far by the developing countries to\r\nimplement their commitments under the Programme of\r\nAction of the World Summit for Social Development. We\r\nappreciate in particular the role played by civil society in\r\nsensitizing public opinion to follow-up activities to the\r\nSummit.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nAt the regional level, the Secretary-General\u0027s report,\r\ndocument A/52/305, informs us about the Conference held\r\nby the Economic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC) in São Paulo in April 1997. Also\r\nproposed are meetings of the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in\r\nNovember 1997 and the Economic Commission for Europe\r\n(ECE) in February 1998 on the review of the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit. We\r\nwelcome these initiatives and call on the international\r\ncommunity to lend full support to the implementation of the\r\noutcome of these meetings.\r\nThe developing countries, indeed, bear the primary\r\nresponsibility for attaining the goals of the Conference.\r\nIndividually they have to ensure equal access for all their\r\ncitizens to resources and opportunities and undertake\r\npolicies geared to a more equitable distribution of wealth\r\nand income. At the same time, the support of the\r\ninternational community — including the United Nations\r\nsystem, the international financial institutions, as well as\r\nother multilateral and bilateral donors — is required to\r\ncomplement the efforts of the developing countries.\r\nIt is in this respect that we note with gratification, in\r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s report (A/52/305), that with the\r\nimplementation of the International Year for the Eradication\r\nof Poverty in 1996 the United Nations has laid the\r\ngroundwork for the observance of the first United Nations\r\nDecade for the Eradication of Poverty, 1997-2006. We\r\nparticularly note with appreciation that the ad hoc inter-\r\nagency task forces established by the Administrative\r\nCommittee on Coordination provided coordinated assistance\r\nto developing countries in formulating or strengthening anti-\r\npoverty strategies and plans of action through the United\r\nNations resident coordinators at the country level and with\r\nthe support of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP).\r\nEmployment and adequate income are important\r\nfactors in promoting social security. It is therefore\r\ndistressing that more than a billion people in the world are\r\neither unemployed or underemployed.\r\nThe consideration of its priority theme for 1997,\r\nproductive employment and sustainable livelihoods, by the\r\nCommission for Social Development at its thirty-fifth\r\nsession once more brought to the fore the inability of\r\nGovernments in many developing countries to find\r\nproductive employment for a rapidly growing labour force\r\nin the formal and informal sectors. For its part, the Inter-\r\nAgency Task Force on Employment and Sustainable\r\nLivelihoods has rightly identified high and productive\r\nlevels of employment as the fundamental means of\r\ncombating poverty and preserving social cohesion.\r\nWe therefore share the concern expressed in the\r\nInter-Agency Task Force\u0027s report that employment\r\nstrategies in countries that have embarked on structural\r\nadjustment programmes have been adversely affected by\r\nthe need to control public spending and curb inflation.\r\nClearly, there is an urgent need for the introduction of\r\nbalanced priorities that would put employment growth at\r\nthe centre of economic and social policy planning without\r\nneglecting other equally important objectives. This is the\r\nmost effective way to translate into reality the objective\r\nof attaining full, productive and freely chosen\r\nemployment.\r\nIn recent months the attention of Governments in the\r\ndeveloping world has been focused also on the\r\nimprovement of access to credit for the poor. The\r\ndeclaration adopted by the microcredit summit held in\r\nWashington in February 1997 marks a watershed in this\r\ndomain and should be recognized as a bold initiative that\r\ncould enhance the income-generating activities of the\r\npoorer segments of society, including artisans, self-\r\nemployed traders, small farmers and women. We laud the\r\nincreasing international awareness of microfinancing or\r\nmicrocredit as an efficient mechanism for providing\r\nfinancing for production to this category of citizens.\r\nAccess to credits for these people would improve their\r\nbusinesses, empower them economically and thus free\r\nthem from poverty. We therefore call on the developing\r\ncountries to intensify their efforts in promoting the\r\nrequisite institutions for microfinancing and the\r\ninternational community, including the international\r\nfinancial institutions, to lend the necessary complementary\r\nsupport.\r\nWe must not forget the aged and the disabled in any\r\ndiscussions on eradication of poverty. Employment\r\nopportunities for the disabled and productive activities for\r\nthe aged must form an integral part of any poverty\r\neradication programme. In this connection we call for\r\nadequate preparations for the observance of the\r\nInternational Year of the Older Person in 1999.\r\nNor must we forget the needs of the youth. The\r\nyouth are the future of the world. Therefore, the World\r\nProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and\r\nBeyond must be implemented with assiduity by all\r\nconcerned. We look forward to the forthcoming world\r\nconference of ministers responsible for youth which is\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nscheduled to take place in Portugal in August 1999, and we\r\ncall for all possible assistance from the international\r\ncommunity in making the conference a success.\r\nLastly, it bears emphasizing that all the instruments of\r\ndevelopment need to be brought to bear on the struggle to\r\neradicate poverty from the world. The international\r\neconomic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade\r\nprospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access\r\nto science and technology, technical assistance and\r\nincreased financial flows, both private and official. Above\r\nall, the poor countries need be freed from the crushing\r\nburden of external debt so as to enhance their financial\r\ncapacity to implement their poverty eradication\r\nprogrammes.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): At the outset, I wish to\r\nassociate my delegation with the statement made earlier by\r\nthe representative of the United Republic of Tanzania on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and to join previous\r\nspeakers in thanking the Secretary-General for the report\r\ncontained in document A/52/305. The report contains useful\r\ninformation on follow-up activities undertaken by\r\nGovernments and by the United Nations system since the\r\nadoption of last year\u0027s General Assembly resolution on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development. As described by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, there have been significant efforts on the part of\r\nthe United Nations bodies engaged in the follow-up process\r\nto implement the provisions of the resolution and to\r\nconsolidate joint activities.\r\nMy delegation wishes to highlight specifically the\r\nagreed conclusions on productive employment and\r\nsustainable livelihoods, adopted by the Commission for\r\nSocial Development at its thirty-sixth session and\r\nconsidered by the Economic and Social Council at its\r\nsubstantive session in July 1997. We also welcome the\r\nadoption by the Economic and Social Council of the\r\nresolution on poverty eradication as well as the agreed\r\nconclusions on the theme of fostering an enabling\r\nenvironment for development.\r\nMy delegation also commends the active participation\r\nof the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nand the International Labour Organization (ILO) in the\r\nInter-Agency Task Force on Employment and Sustainable\r\nLivelihoods, and notes the important contribution of\r\nUNDP\u0027s MicroStart Pilot Programme, which provides\r\ninstitutional and capital support to microfinance institutions\r\nand networks in 25 pilot countries, thereby increasing\r\naccess to financial services for poor people and micro-\r\nentrepreneurs. We were also interested to learn of the\r\nUNDP-supported project on social exclusion, and\r\nanticipate receiving the results of UNDP\u0027s current\r\nexamination of the ways in which the analysis of\r\nexclusion could render anti-poverty strategies more\r\neffective. This, we feel, could be useful in informing next\r\nyear\u0027s discussion of the Summit theme of social\r\nintegration.\r\nIn terms of activities undertaken in the wider\r\ninternational arena, the micro-credit summit and the First\r\nRegional Conference in Follow-up to the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, held in Brazil in April 1997,\r\nillustrate the commitment of States to ensuring the\r\nsuccess of the follow-up process.\r\nJamaica, like other Member States, participated\r\nactively in the World Summit for Social Development and\r\nfully endorsed the fundamental principles embodied in the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration. We are fully conscious,\r\nhowever, that the true measure of our commitment must\r\nbe demonstrated in concrete actions. In my own country,\r\nwe have recently developed national policies on the aged,\r\nthe disabled, youth and the family, thereby reflecting our\r\ncommitment to the various international conventions to\r\nwhich Jamaica is a party and, consequently, to national\r\ndevelopment.\r\nTurning to the issue of employment and sustainable\r\nlivelihoods, Jamaica\u0027s philosophy on employment policy\r\ngenerally mirrors the provisions of the International\r\nLabour Organisation Employment Policy Convention,\r\n1964 (No. 122) and Employment Policy\r\nRecommendation, 1964 (No. 122). It is the aim of the\r\nJamaican Government to develop adequate employment\r\nopportunities, matched by improvements in the skills and\r\nliteracy of our human resources, recognizing that an\r\neffectively trained, adaptable and flexible work force is\r\ncritical if we are to meet the demands of the economy.\r\nThe Jamaican Government has therefore undertaken\r\nseveral initiatives aimed at providing entry-level and\r\ninformal training opportunities, primarily for youth, the\r\npoor and the unemployed, to prepare them for gainful\r\nemployment. At the tertiary level, new programmes of\r\ntraining have been introduced in response to the demands\r\nof the labour market.\r\nThe people and Government of Jamaica have long\r\nrecognized that small businesses, which incorporate small-\r\nscale enterprises, micro-enterprises and cooperatives, have\r\nthe potential to create jobs, utilize local raw materials and\r\ninvolve large numbers of people in national decision-\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nmaking and social and economic development. In Jamaica,\r\nthis sector employs more than 22 per cent of the employed\r\nlabour force, more than 50 per cent of whom are women.\r\nNevertheless, the sector\u0027s full potential, in terms of\r\nemployment and income generation, has yet to be realized.\r\nIt is therefore the goal of the Government to act as a\r\ncatalyst to improve the sector.\r\nThe Jamaican Government is also working with key\r\nactors in this sector on the provision of capital for the\r\nsector\u0027s expansion, and has been greatly assisted in this\r\nventure by several bilateral and multilateral donors.\r\nWe believe that it is necessary to transform the\r\ninformal sector from a low-income, subsistence-level one to\r\nan economically viable one, as this is central to attaining\r\nthe goals of full employment and sustainable livelihood\r\nand, consequently, the eradication of poverty.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize the vulnerability of the\r\neconomies of small States such as those in our subregion.\r\nCaribbean economies remain severely hampered by the\r\nexternal debt burden, unfavourable terms of trade, narrow\r\nresource bases and the threat posed by international drug\r\ntrafficking, among other factors. In this connection, it has\r\nlong been recognized that there is a correspondingly urgent\r\nneed for the mobilization of resources to assist national and\r\ninternational social development programmes.\r\nWe therefore note with interest the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nreport on new and innovative ideas for generating funds for\r\nglobally agreed commitments and priorities, which was\r\npresented to the Economic and Social Council in July 1997.\r\nJamaica wishes to reiterate its appreciation to the\r\nrelevant agencies of the United Nations system for their\r\nresponsiveness to the various Government initiatives in the\r\narea of social development. The United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children\u0027s\r\nFund (UNICEF) and the International Labour Organization\r\n(ILO), to name but a few, have all participated strategically\r\nin national consultations and have made both financial and\r\nhuman resources available to the Government of Jamaica.\r\nThe Jamaican Government remains firmly committed\r\nto the implementation of the Summit commitments. We\r\nlook forward to continued dialogue with our partners in the\r\ninternational arena on ways and means of achieving global\r\nsolutions to the myriad of problems which we face in the\r\narea of social development.\r\nMr. Aass (Norway): The World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment acknowledged the close interlinkages that\r\nexist between aspects of development, in particular\r\nbetween the social and economic dimensions. The\r\nSummit further emphasized the need to pursue the core\r\nobjectives of poverty eradication, productive employment\r\nand social integration in a comprehensive manner.\r\nThe Copenhagen Summit also reaffirmed that the\r\nmost productive policies and investments, in both\r\neconomic and social terms, are those that empower people\r\nto maximize their capacities, resources and opportunities.\r\nAt the Summit, world leaders stated their commitment to\r\npromote people-centred development, based on the\r\npromotion and protection of all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. The responsibility for\r\nimplementing the Summit recommendations rests\r\nprimarily at the national level, but international\r\ncooperation is essential for their full implementation, in\r\nparticular in Africa and the least developed countries.\r\nThe United Nations system has an important role to\r\nplay in the follow-up to the Summit, in particular in\r\nproviding support for action at the national level. Norway\r\nwould like to reiterate that it is crucial that this task be\r\nconducted in an integrated manner and that follow-up to\r\nthe Social Summit be coordinated with the follow-up of\r\nthe other major United Nations conferences of this\r\ndecade, in particular those at Rio, Vienna, Cairo and\r\nBeijing.\r\nIn our joint efforts to follow up the Summit\r\nrecommendations, Norway has taken a special interest in\r\npromoting the goal of universal access to basic social\r\nservices, which is central to all three core objectives of\r\nthe Summit. Not only do basic health and education\r\nproduce invaluable individual and social benefits, both are\r\nessential for sustainable economic development and\r\nconstitute an investment in people\u0027s hope for the future.\r\nThe Programme of Action of the Social Summit\r\nunderlines universal access to basic education as an\r\nimportant means to combat child labour. Children should\r\nbe at school, not at work, but the latter is, unfortunately,\r\nthe reality for millions of children in today\u0027s world.\r\nWork at an early age is a serious problem, not only\r\nbecause child labour is often performed under exploitative\r\nand hazardous conditions, but also because it interferes\r\nwith the child\u0027s emotional, educational and social\r\ndevelopment. Conditions surrounding child labour\r\nfrequently constitute serious violations of the Convention\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\non the Rights of the Child. Norway sees child labour as a\r\nhuman rights issue as well as a development issue, and has\r\ntherefore made the fight against child labour a priority issue\r\nfor development cooperation.\r\nThere is a growing consensus that the elimination of\r\nchild labour requires specific policies targeting working\r\nchildren and adolescents, including major efforts to increase\r\nthe accessibility, quality and affordability of primary\r\neducation. Policies aimed at making education a viable and\r\nrewarding option for all children are urgently needed.\r\nNorway will continue to support activities to make\r\neducation for all a reality, as education is also one of the\r\nmost forceful measures to combat child labour.\r\nTo improve cooperation between actors at different\r\nlevels fighting against child labour, Norway is convening an\r\ninternational conference at Oslo, from 27 to 30 October.\r\nThe objective of the Oslo conference is to identify\r\nstrategies at the national, regional and international levels\r\nfor the elimination of child labour, with a special focus on\r\nthe role of development cooperation. It is our hope that the\r\ncountries invited to the conference will agree upon an\r\nagenda for action committing them to fight against child\r\nlabour.\r\nThe Social Summit took an important step towards the\r\ngoal of universal access to basic social services by urging\r\ninterested countries to implement the 20/20 initiative. The\r\nGovernments and multilateral organizations that met at Oslo\r\nin April 1996 brought the initiative closer to reality by\r\nadopting the Oslo Consensus, which reaffirmed that\r\ninvesting in a country\u0027s human resources, in particular in\r\nwomen and children, means investing in the future and is\r\nthus fundamental to realizing the full potential for social\r\nand economic development. Promoting access for all to\r\nbasic social services is essential for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and should be an integral part of any strategy\r\nto overcome poverty. The 20/20 initiative should be a tool\r\nfor developing countries and their partners wanting jointly\r\nto give higher priority to basic social services.\r\nThe participants in the Oslo meeting agreed that a\r\nfollow-up meeting should be held within two years to\r\nexchange information and experiences and to review and\r\nassess progress in implementing the 20/20 initiative. For its\r\npart, Norway took on the responsibility to ensure that such\r\na follow-up meeting would take place, and I am pleased to\r\nannounce that a small working group with representatives\r\nfrom developed and developing countries and from\r\nmultilateral organizations has now been established to\r\nprepare for this Oslo+2 meeting. The Government of Viet\r\nNam has kindly offered to host the event during the\r\nsecond half of 1998, and several United Nations agencies\r\nare actively participating in the process, inter alia by\r\norganizing studies of the status of 20/20 at country level.\r\nThe United Nations Children\u0027s Fund has taken on special\r\nresponsibility for the practical preparations. It is our hope\r\nthat the Oslo+2 meeting will demonstrate a growing\r\ninterest in the initiative, and that the meeting will be able\r\nto review concrete efforts to translate the Oslo Consensus\r\ninto practical action in a number of countries.\r\nIn addition to a mutual commitment along the lines\r\nof the 20/20 initiative, another long-standing target needs\r\na reaffirmed commitment by developed countries. I am\r\nspeaking of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product for official development assistance. Were\r\nthat target to be reached, it would more than double the\r\namount available to finance development and would thus\r\nsignificantly increase our chances of achieving the\r\nobjectives set by the Social Summit.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to welcome the\r\ndecision made by the Economic and Social Council\r\nearlier this year to renew the mandate of the Special\r\nRapporteur on Disability for another three years. Norway\r\nhas been and will continue to be a strong supporter, in\r\nboth political and financial terms, of the function of the\r\nSpecial Rapporteur. Enabling and encouraging people\r\nwith disabilities to participate actively in and make their\r\nfull contribution to society must be an integral part of our\r\nefforts to create a society for all, in the true spirit of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit.\r\nMr. Martini Herrera (Guatemala) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): It is my honour to speak on behalf of\r\nCosta Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama\r\nand Guatemala. I wish first of all to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nCentral America has made a notable effort to\r\nimplement the commitments undertaken at the\r\nCopenhagen World Summit for Social Development. It\r\nhas done this at the national level by formulating and\r\nimplementing local and community development policies,\r\nand at the regional level by setting out sectoral strategies\r\nin the context of the Treaty on Central American Social\r\nIntegration, which stemmed from the Central American\r\nsocial summit. That 1995 instrument, in force since May\r\n1996, set out joint commitments in the area of social\r\ndevelopment. It has led to the implementation of\r\nadministrative measures and provisions, and to the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nformulation of social policies to carry out those\r\ncommitments.\r\nTackling the social challenges in a region such as\r\nCentral America, which is beleaguered by social clashes,\r\nhas required Central American Governments to demonstrate\r\nthe firm determination to do all they can to implement\r\neffective social policies and programmes that, most\r\nimportant, will provide greater coverage for the most\r\nvulnerable social groups. This political will of our\r\nGovernments is reflected in their consistent support for\r\ndevelopment projects that involve these elements.\r\nCentral America is optimistic about developments in\r\nthe social sphere in recent months, such as the micro-credit\r\nsummit in Washington, whose conclusions and results will\r\nplay a strategic role in the resolute struggle against extreme\r\npoverty.\r\nAt its 1997 substantive session, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council considered an item entitled “Fostering an\r\nenabling environment for development — financial flows,\r\nincluding capital flows; investment; trade”. We welcome\r\nthe agreed conclusions recommended in that context. We\r\nare pleased that we thus have a framework for international\r\ncooperation, for national policies and for the role of the\r\nUnited Nations system, all of which should, in our view, be\r\nstrengthened to promote sustainable development and the\r\nelimination of the marginalization that many developing\r\ncountries are facing.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council also decided to\r\nconsider globally the issue of poverty eradication for the\r\npurpose of contributing to the special session which the\r\nGeneral Assembly intends to hold in the year 2000 in order\r\nto conduct a general review of the World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment and the five-year review of the Beijing\r\nPlatform for Action. In our view, this issue is of utmost\r\nimportance, and Central America is particularly interested\r\nin it. It is the main reason why the Governments of the area\r\nare currently making efforts in the context of what is\r\nknown as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of\r\nCentral America. This mechanism is intended to promote\r\nthe regional policy of comprehensive and social\r\ndevelopment, in which the creation of jobs and income-\r\nproducing activities represents an essential element with a\r\ndirect impact on the fight against poverty.\r\nIt is also encouraging that the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean region has held, through the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean\r\n(ECLAC), the First Regional Conference in follow-up to\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development. At that\r\nConference, an effort was made to consider the activities\r\nconducted by countries of the region, to formulate\r\nrecommendations to its Governments, to promote regional\r\nand subregional cooperation and to make available a\r\nforum for the exchange of information.\r\nThe signing in 1995 of the Treaty on Central\r\nAmerican Social Integration led to the creation of the\r\nCentral American Integration System (SICA), thus\r\nestablishing the main objectives of the Central American\r\nsocial subsystem. The framework of this subsystem\r\nprovides for the implementation and coordination of\r\nsocial policies at a regional level and promotes unified\r\naction in international aid for Central America in the\r\nareas of education, health, housing, urban and rural\r\ndevelopment, and so on.\r\nThe Nicaragua Declaration, signed one and a half\r\nmonths ago, strengthened the process of regional\r\nintegration and laid the foundation for a possible political\r\nunification of the Central American countries, and it\r\nfurther enhanced Central American social, economic and\r\ntrade policy. Among the key objectives of this policy are\r\nthe sustainable development of the region, based on\r\novercoming poverty, and the participation of organized\r\ncivil society and the population in general, as well as\r\nenvironmental preservation and the rational and\r\nsustainable use of natural resources.\r\nAt its thirty-fifth session, the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment considered the priority item of productive\r\nemployment and sustainable livelihood and recommended\r\nthat the importance of increasing the job growth rate be\r\nemphasized. In our view, this must go hand in hand with\r\nstriking a balance between multiplying the number of jobs\r\nand diversifying the economic activities which are\r\ncompatible with the realities of our region as a region of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nUnemployment is one of the most serious problems\r\nfacing the Central American region. This, given the even\r\nmore generalized problem of underemployment added to\r\ninadequate productivity and low remuneration, is the main\r\ncause of poverty. Thus it becomes increasingly necessary\r\nto broaden to the greatest extent possible the quality and\r\naccessibility of social services, especially education and\r\npublic health, in order to increase employment and\r\nimprove the well-being of our people. These goals require\r\nan increase in economic growth and social cooperation at\r\nthe international level.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nReally sustainable development must be based on the\r\neradication of poverty, on the participation of the entire\r\ncivil society, on the creation of jobs, on the protection and\r\nimprovement of the social and environmental climate and\r\non the strengthening of the social-management ability of\r\nlocal governments. These challenges impose on all\r\nGovernments the responsibility to continue to make efforts\r\nto implement fully the commitments they have made\r\ntowards their own societies as well as the commitments\r\nadopted at the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Park (Republic of Korea): The 1995 World\r\nSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen provided\r\nthe international community with an invaluable opportunity\r\nto put into practice the concept of human-centred\r\ndevelopment as a means of enhancing the welfare of the\r\nhuman community. Indeed, it reaffirmed the principle that\r\ndevelopment and social justice are indispensable for\r\nachieving and maintaining world peace and security.\r\nThe Summit mobilized the world leaders to tackle\r\nsocial issues with the aim of building a new society where\r\nhuman rights and social development are enjoyed to the\r\nfullest extent by all human beings. It is imperative that\r\nsocial development continues to enjoy high priority among\r\nthe policy initiatives of national Governments and of global\r\nsociety as a whole. Clearly, any action at the global level\r\ncalls for a multi-faceted approach among national\r\nGovernments, the United Nations and civil society.\r\nIn this context, my delegation notes with appreciation\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General contained in document\r\nA/52/305 detailing the progress made so far. The\r\ninformation contained therein on the follow-up efforts of\r\nnational Governments, the United Nations system and civil\r\nsociety provides new impetus and direction in preparing for\r\nthe “Copenhagen+5” special session of the General\r\nAssembly in the year 2000.\r\nCommitment 3 of the Copenhagen Declaration\r\nreaffirmed our resolve to promote full employment as a\r\nbasic priority of economic and social policies. However, we\r\nare presently faced with a grim picture of global\r\nunemployment. According to estimates of the International\r\nLabour Organization (ILO), almost one billion people are\r\neither out of work or underemployed.\r\nLast March the thirty-fifth session of the Commission\r\nfor Social Development closely studied and actively\r\ndiscussed, as a priority theme, productive employment\r\nand sustainable livelihoods. We fully support the\r\nCommission\u0027s agreed conclusions calling upon\r\nGovernments to set time-bound goals for expanding\r\nemployment and reducing unemployment. As those\r\nconclusions emphasized, productive employment requires\r\ninternational, mutually reinforcing economic growth and\r\nsocial cooperation and should be bolstered by balanced\r\nmacro-economic policies lest other important goals,\r\nincluding inflation containment and financial stability, be\r\ndisplaced.\r\nDrawing upon Korea\u0027s own experience of the process\r\nof economic and social development, my delegation\r\nwould like to touch briefly on some aspects of productive\r\nemployment, particularly as it relates to the developing\r\nworld. First, the expansion of small-scale, labour-intensive\r\nindustries should be encouraged. This can be\r\naccomplished through the promotion of public investment\r\nand by redistributing income to poorer sectors of society,\r\nwhose demand for consumer goods is coincidentally less\r\nimport-intensive and more labour-intensive than those at\r\nhigher income levels. In doing so, effective labour-\r\nintensive manufacturing technologies must be identified\r\nby supporting indigenous technological research and\r\nadaptation capacities. As an initial step, the development\r\nof low-cost, labour-intensive methods to meet rural\r\ninfrastructure needs could be pursued.\r\nSecondly, education must be more closely linked to\r\nemployment. Clearly, education is vital to the promotion\r\nof productive employment. However, it may be more\r\nfeasible to develop and implement educational strategies\r\nin the context of rural development.\r\nResolution 51/202, adopted by the General Assembly\r\nlast year, called upon all participating Governments, as\r\nagreed at the Copenhagen Summit, to work towards\r\nachieving within their national contexts a series of\r\nparamount objectives spelled out in the Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nSince the Summit, the Korean Government has\r\ndeveloped various follow-up measures to the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. At the national\r\nlevel, the Social Welfare Law entered into force in June\r\n1996, and the Social Welfare Council, headed by the\r\nPrime Minister, was established in November last year to\r\nprovide direction for future welfare policies as well as to\r\nenhance coordination among relevant ministries.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nAs the recipient last year of the first Franklin Delano\r\nRoosevelt International Disability Award from the Franklin\r\nand Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, my Government has been\r\npursuing vigorously the goal of full participation and\r\nequality for the more than 1 million disabled persons in\r\nKorea. In that spirit, a five-year welfare development plan\r\nfor disabled persons was recently put in place.\r\nWith the conviction that the social integration of older\r\npersons is a pressing moral imperative, we enacted last\r\nAugust the Older Persons Welfare Law to further extend\r\nthe sphere of welfare benefits to senior citizens. We have\r\nalso developed proactive employment guidelines for\r\nemployers to promote employment opportunities for the\r\nelderly, and many companies have already begun to\r\nparticipate in this very worthwhile initiative.\r\nTurning now to follow-up measures to the\r\ncommitment to international cooperation made by my\r\ndelegation during the Summit, we wish to take this\r\nopportunity to reaffirm our pledge to actively undertake all\r\nefforts to that end.\r\nDespite the trend of an overall decline in official\r\ndevelopment assistance at the global level, my Government\r\nhas substantially increased the scale of its official\r\ndevelopment assistance — in particular, grant-type aid —\r\nby 30 per cent this year, and will do its utmost to maintain\r\nthis course in the future, despite our lagging economy at\r\npresent.\r\nWe have given careful consideration to the unabated\r\nplight of the least developed countries. As a strong\r\nsupporter of the Secretary-General\u0027s initiative, the United\r\nNations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa, my\r\nGovernment has participated in bilateral cooperation efforts\r\nwith the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), and\r\nplans to undertake a programme for the development of\r\nAfrica for the period 1998-2000.\r\nSince our President\u0027s announcement, at the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, of Korea\u0027s plan to provide\r\ntechnical training to some 30,000 people from developing\r\ncountries by the year 2010, we have already — between\r\n1995 and 1997 — carried out training programmes for\r\napproximately 3,200 people. We intend to invite around\r\n1,500 people next year, and will continue to increase the\r\nnumber of trainees substantially in the coming years. Next\r\nyear will see the completion of the International Training\r\nCentre, whose aim will be to enhance and further\r\nconsolidate these training programmes.\r\nIn September of this year, the Korean Government\r\nhosted in Seoul a meeting organized by the Economic and\r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to\r\nmark the mid-point of the Asian and Pacific Decade of\r\nDisabled Persons, 1993-2002. That meeting reaffirmed\r\nour commitment to the full implementation of the agenda\r\nof the Asian and Pacific Decade. Youth issues are also a\r\nprimary concern to my Government. Building upon the\r\nsuccess of the Global Youth Forum held in 1995, and as\r\na follow-up to the Social Summit, Korea is setting up an\r\ninternational youth exchange centre, designed to promote\r\nyouth exchange programmes and friendship.\r\nThe role of non-governmental organizations has been\r\ncontinuously strengthened in the field of social issues.\r\nTheir active participation in the policy-making process, as\r\nwell as in the stages of implementation, has helped\r\ncomplement governmental efforts to translate the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action into tangible\r\nrealities. Their role as so-called “watchdogs”, and their\r\ncontribution at the grassroots level to raising public\r\nawareness, as well as to promoting fund-raising, has\r\nbecome an integral part of the common effort to address\r\nsocial issues. We look forward to the further\r\nstrengthening of the tripartite partnership among non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, national Governments and the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nIn closing, I would like to emphasize that the\r\nprocess of social development requires not only\r\nimprovement in a materialistic sense but also meaningful\r\nprogress in terms of democratization and governance. Full\r\nrespect for human rights; the rule of law; gender equality;\r\nrespect for ethnicity, religion and diversity; and\r\nparticipation in free and fair democratic elections — these\r\nare the basic ingredients for human-centred development.\r\nSocial development in its purest sense can only become\r\na reality when human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nare wholly guaranteed.\r\nMr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I should like at the outset to endorse the\r\nstatement made by the delegation of the United Republic\r\nof Tanzania on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development had the\r\nvirtue of strengthening the recognition of the human being\r\nas the subject and end of any development strategy or\r\npolicy at the national as well as global level. However,\r\nthat was only the beginning of a long and hard road.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nSome 1.3 billion people still live below the poverty\r\nline, and every day 68,000 more are added to the number\r\nof those living in absolute poverty. Some 13 million\r\nchildren die of hunger every year — that is, 35,000 every\r\nday; 507 million people will not live to the age of 40; 1.2\r\nbillion people lack access to drinking-water; and 842\r\nmillion adults are illiterate. Most of these millions of people\r\nlive in developing countries. There are still innumerable\r\nobstacles to social development, many of them structural,\r\nbut such development is both necessary and feasible, if we\r\nwant to live in a politically and socially stable world.\r\nMy delegation shares the concerns about the world\u0027s\r\nemployment problem expressed by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis report [A/52/305]. Inequalities in the distribution of\r\nwealth at the global, national and local levels have\r\ncontinued to multiply at an alarming rate. Special mention\r\nshould be made of the difficulties of mobilizing\r\ninternational resources for development, which must be\r\nconceived of as a comprehensive process involving\r\neconomic and social factors. Official development\r\nassistance is below the goal of 0.7 per cent of the gross\r\ndomestic product of the developed donor countries, and all\r\nthe signs point to a continued downward trend in the next\r\nfew years. By contrast, those countries allocate\r\napproximately 3 per cent to military expenditure, which is\r\ninconceivable in the light of the end of the cold war.\r\nOfficial development assistance can be supplemented\r\nby other ways of mobilizing resources, but it together with\r\nchanges to the current international economic order, must\r\ncontinue to be the main element of a strategy for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe burden of external debt continues to suffocate a\r\nsizeable group of developing countries. The proposed\r\nremedies are often accompanied by the imposition of\r\nreform and structural adjustment programmes whose\r\nadverse effects upon the populations of debtor countries\r\nhave contributed to explosive social situations in those\r\ncountries. The globalization of the economy and the\r\nimpetus of neo-liberalism move us daily further away from\r\nthe lofty goals of social justice contained in the\r\ncommitments made at Copenhagen.\r\nAfrican countries and those described as least\r\ndeveloped still need special attention. For this group of\r\nnations, recent developments have been very negative.\r\nPolitical will is still the key to changing the bleak\r\noutlook, which we must deal with. The resources are there\r\nbut they are squandered on unrestrained consumerism and\r\nthe arms race. If we do not create an international\r\nenvironment favourable to economic growth and\r\nsustainable and comprehensive development, it will be\r\nalmost impossible, particularly for the large majority of\r\nthird world countries, to make steady progress along the\r\nroad to social development.\r\nI wish to acknowledge the results of the system-wide\r\ncoordination of efforts to follow up the Copenhagen\r\nSummit. We hope that even more can be done.\r\nCuba was particularly honoured to take part in the\r\nFirst Regional Conference in Follow-up to the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, organized by the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean in São Paulo last April, and welcomed the\r\nreaffirmation of our commitments.\r\nIn the last three decades Cuba has drawn up and\r\nimplemented, with significant results, development\r\npolicies and strategies based on a fairer and more\r\nequitable distribution of wealth. Achievements of this\r\npolicy include the following: 100 per cent of our\r\npopulation has access to free health and education\r\nservices; life expectancy at birth is now over 75 years;\r\n97.5 per cent of children between the ages of 6 and 14\r\nare attending school; the infant mortality rate is 7.9 per\r\n1,000 live births; and 100 per cent of all Cuban children\r\nare vaccinated against 11 preventable diseases.\r\nThe sudden ending of external economic relations\r\nfocused mainly on Eastern Europe and the former Soviet\r\nUnion, together with the stepping up of the United States\r\nGovernment\u0027s blockade against Cuba, has presented my\r\nGovernment with new and greater challenges in\r\nimplementing its social development policy. However, the\r\ninfrastructure created over the last 37 years, the social\r\nprotection policies we have implemented, and the\r\ncreativity and participation of the people in this endeavour\r\nhave allowed Cuba not just to defend its main social\r\nsuccesses but also in many cases to improve on them.\r\nThe fact that we have managed to defend the most\r\nimportant social benefits in decades, in such difficult and\r\nunusual conditions, strengthens the thesis that in a\r\nframework of social justice and an equitable distribution\r\nof wealth, certain basic goals of social development can\r\nbe reached in situations where economic growth is\r\nlimited, even negative. We have also shown that even\r\nwhen management mechanisms are more decentralized,\r\nthe State can retain its ability to guide and regulate social\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\npolicy as a way of guaranteeing a comprehensive and\r\ndurable social policy.\r\nMy country continues to be ready to share its\r\nexperiences in this area and take an active part in any effort\r\nby the international community to encourage\r\nimplementation of the commitments entered into at the\r\nCopenhagen Summit.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): First of all, like many\r\nothers, my delegation wishes to associate itself with the\r\nstatement made earlier this morning by the representative of\r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China.\r\nMongolia attaches great importance to the Assembly\u0027s\r\nconsideration of this agenda item, entitled “Implementation\r\nof the Outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment”.\r\nThe peaceful advance of humankind and its secure\r\nlivelihood can no longer be sustained in a world\r\nimpregnated by abject poverty, an external debt burden, a\r\ngrowing technological and economic gap between the rich\r\nand the poor, widespread hunger and malnutrition, violence\r\nand discrimination, drugs and infectious diseases, and so\r\non.\r\nMindful of the urgent need adequately to address these\r\nproblems, the international community in the early 1990s\r\ntook various actions, including the organization of a series\r\nof world Summits and conferences, and the proclamation\r\nand observation of United Nations decades and international\r\nyears on specific social issues and target groups.\r\nThe agreements reached at these conferences form a\r\nstrong basis for development cooperation and for the future\r\nrole of the United Nations in these areas. It should be\r\npointed out that development cooperation has been given\r\npeople-centred, sustainable, gender-sensitive and social\r\ndimensions.\r\nIn order to consolidate a basis for development\r\ncooperation, all have come to the realization that we all\r\ndepend on one another for sustainable development and\r\nprogress. Coordination of policies and joint decision-making\r\nat the global level are required if we wish to move closer\r\nto the aim of securing a life of dignity for humankind, now\r\nand in the future. Effective action to realize the\r\nundertakings agreed upon require both the means and a\r\nstreamlining of efforts and activities.\r\nThe Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development\r\nand the Programme of Action of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development envisage both national and\r\ninternational developmental efforts, recognizing that while\r\nsocial development remains a national responsibility, the\r\nsupport, collective commitment and efforts of the\r\ninternational community are essential for achieving the\r\ngoals set forth in Copenhagen.\r\nMongolia welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s report\r\nentitled “Implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development” (A/52/305), which\r\ncontains rich, useful and quite revealing information on\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit. It is gratifying to note the growing initiatives\r\nundertaken at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels.\r\nThe micro-credit summit held last February and\r\nattended by representatives from 137 countries, including\r\nMongolia, recognized — and practice has confirmed —\r\nthat building institutions capable of providing micro-\r\nfinance services is a viable strategy to eradicate poverty\r\nand promote small businesses.\r\nMongolia strongly believes that the implementation\r\nof the Summit decisions calls for serious political\r\ncommitment on the part of the international community to\r\nsubstantially increase resources for sustainable human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMongolia also welcomes the 1997 Report on the\r\nWorld Social Situation, prepared by the former United\r\nNations Department for Economic and Social Information\r\nand Policy, the first report after the Copenhagen Summit.\r\nIts coverage of outstanding social issues is broad and\r\nextensive, providing a clear picture of the world social\r\nsituation.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia considers that one\r\npractical way to raise the living standards of a population\r\nand reduce poverty is to increase employment\r\nopportunities. Therefore, the Government is actively\r\npursuing a policy of human-resource development. The\r\nMongolian National Programme on Poverty Alleviation\r\n(NPPA), referred to in the Secretary-General\u0027s report, was\r\nlaunched in 1994. Its major aim is to promote\r\nemployment and income-generation opportunities,\r\nespecially in rural areas and among disadvantaged\r\nwomen, create social safety nets for the poor and seek\r\nincorporation of poverty-alleviation goals in all aspects of\r\npolicy-making. The NPPA is carried out in conjunction\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nwith the Population Policy of Mongolia and the National\r\nProgramme of Advancement of Women, and is also assisted\r\nby a national programme on employment generation.\r\nThe overall aim of the NPPA is to reduce the number\r\nof people in poverty from 26 per cent of the population to\r\n10 per cent by the year 2000. It focuses on strengthening\r\nthe institutional capacities of the Government at both\r\ncentral and local levels, policy management and poverty\r\nmonitoring, promoting human resources development\r\nthrough providing better access to health and education\r\nopportunities, alleviating rural poverty, good governance\r\nand developing and strengthening the basic social safety\r\nnet.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia is committed to\r\npursuing this policy by allocating 20 per cent of its annual\r\nbudget, as well as 20 per cent of all foreign aid and\r\nassistance, to social development activities by adopting the\r\n20/20 formula agreed at the Social Summit. At the same\r\ntime, the Government is working to create the conditions\r\nfor everyone to complete education and training, as well as\r\nto ensure that those engaged in productive labour receive\r\nsufficient social guarantees to meet their health and other\r\nrequirements. The Government intends to meet these goals\r\nby the year 2000.\r\nMongolia is aware that without visible socio-economic\r\nprogress, the process of democratization, especially when it\r\nis carried out simultaneously with economic transition, as\r\nis the case with Mongolia, can face the difficult challenges\r\nof social instability. Following the micro-credit summit, the\r\nGovernment organized, late last June, a national forum on\r\nsmall credits which discussed the ways in which the poor\r\nand disadvantaged can be given greater access to productive\r\nassets and resources.\r\nThe Mongolian Human Development Report was\r\nlaunched recently in cooperation with the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, which identified and established\r\nthe social benchmarks against which actions aimed at social\r\ndevelopment can be assessed. This report is the first\r\nassessment of Mongolia\u0027s human-development situation. All\r\nnational development efforts need a vision — a focal point\r\nto make coordinated and sustained improvements —\r\nsupported by political will, the participation of the people\r\nand solid organizational and financial backing.\r\nI would like to underline that Mongolia\u0027s interaction\r\nwith the United Nations, its agencies and other international\r\norganizations and our bilateral cooperation with Member\r\nStates, have played, and continue to play, a valuable role in\r\novercoming underdevelopment and the hardships inherent\r\nto a transitional period, as well as meeting our pressing\r\nsocio-economic challenges. In this connection, I would\r\nlike to express the gratitude of my Government to the\r\ndonor countries, the United Nations and other\r\ninternational institutions for their continued support and\r\nassistance extended to my country.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my delegation\u0027s\r\nsincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will\r\nhelp generate renewed political will at the national,\r\nregional and international levels to attain the noble\r\nobjectives of sustainable human development.\r\nMs. Hall (United States of America): The United\r\nStates delegation is pleased with this opportunity for the\r\nGeneral Assembly to meet again to take stock of the\r\nprogress the international community has made in\r\nimplementing the commitments made in 1995 at the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen,\r\nand to share the lessons we have learned in doing so. The\r\ntask before us at that time was indeed a daunting\r\nchallenge: to formulate ways and identify means to\r\neradicate absolute poverty, create jobs and empower\r\nwomen and men, especially older persons and people with\r\ndisabilities, to become full participants in their societies.\r\nI want to share with the Assembly the good news.\r\nAlthough many challenges remain and there is much more\r\nhard work ahead of us, we have indeed, in our national\r\nprogrammes and multilateral efforts, made progress in\r\naddressing these compelling issues. Our work has been\r\ngreatly facilitated by the participation of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that have helped identify\r\nissues, develop solutions and implement programmes\r\nworldwide. We want to continue the close cooperation\r\nbetween governmental and non-governmental actors as we\r\ncontinue our work.\r\nWe commend the contribution to this work by the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which\r\nstands at the centre of a coordinated international effort to\r\neradicate poverty. Other United Nations funding agencies\r\nalso have important roles to play, including the\r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, with its\r\nfocus on rural poverty; the United Nations Population\r\nFund, with its focus on women, reproductive health and\r\nfamily planning; the United Nations Development Fund\r\nfor Women, wit its emphasis on women\u0027s empowerment;\r\nthe United Nations Children\u0027s Fund, with its focus on\r\nchildren and the girl-child; the Office of the United\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, with its support\r\nfor refugees; and the World Food Programme, which\r\nprovides large-scale support in both emergency and non-\r\nemergency situations. Those organizations, along with\r\nnational and international civil society, have formed key\r\npartnerships to address this most urgent problem.\r\nIn the United States, we have raised the minimum\r\nwage, expanded tax credits for working families and\r\nreduced the federal deficit, all of which provide the basis\r\nfor investment, growth and job creation. The lesson we\r\nhave learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates\r\nmobility, an economy open to competition and sound\r\nmonetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government\r\nthat is representative, transparent and accountable, all\r\ncontribute to the creation of jobs.\r\nAs we create these jobs and expand our economies,\r\nwe need to ensure that all members of our societies\r\nparticipate in and enjoy the benefits of job creation and\r\neconomic growth. In many societies, still too many women,\r\nyouths, the elderly and people with disabilities have been\r\nconsigned to the margins of society. We simply cannot\r\nafford to waste the contributions of so many who have so\r\nmuch to offer. Our piece of legislation known as the\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act has taken great strides to\r\nbreak down barriers to persons with disabilities. We look\r\nforward to sharing our experiences in this area and to\r\nlearning from the experiences of others.\r\nI want to express my delegation\u0027s appreciation for the\r\nwork of Mr. Bengt Lindqvist, the Special Rapporteur on\r\ndisabilities, in helping us focus not only on how we meet\r\nthe needs of persons with disabilities, but also on how we\r\ncan ensure that those with disabilities can achieve their\r\npotential, realize their dreams and become fully integrated\r\nmembers of our societies. We fully support the continuation\r\nof the mandate of the Special Rapporteur.\r\nI also want to express appreciation for the work of the\r\nad hoc informal open-ended support group established by\r\nthe Commission for Social Development to prepare for the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons and the non-\r\ngovernmental organization Committee on Ageing. The\r\ntheme for the Year — Towards a Society for all Ages —\r\nnot only reminds us of the importance of older persons in\r\nour social fabric but highlights the truth that open\r\nsocieties — those that offer all citizens access to education,\r\nhealth care, productive employment and freedom from\r\ndiscrimination — are providing a benefit to their members\r\nacross the entire life span.\r\nI want to reiterate a theme put forth by my\r\ndelegation in the Third Committee earlier this week. At\r\nthat meeting we pointed out that, in this year when there\r\nhas been so much discussion of reform, we must not lose\r\nsight of the reasons for which we are undertaking these\r\nsometimes difficult efforts. Quite simply, it is because of\r\nthe vital importance of addressing social and economic\r\nissues, such as those that continue to concern many\r\nfamilies, youth, the elderly and people with disabilities\r\naround the world, that we committed ourselves to at the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development.\r\nWe look forward to the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the year 2000 to review the status\r\nof the implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. Such special sessions\r\nrevitalize and refocus the General Assembly. We see the\r\nspecial session as a timely opportunity to exchange\r\nexperiences with other delegations with a view to\r\nimplementing programmes that may work in our own\r\ncountries to advance social development, enhance social\r\nintegration and provide basic social services for all. We\r\nlook forward to this opportunity to rededicate ourselves to\r\nthe commitments we made in Copenhagen.\r\nMr. Saliba (Malta): Malta joins other delegations in\r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his report on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development (A/52/305). We welcome the various\r\nactivities being undertaken by Governments, regional\r\norganizations and the United Nations system in fulfilment\r\nof the goals and commitments made at Copenhagen two\r\nyears ago, commitments which are acknowledged to be\r\nprimarily the responsibility of Governments but which can\r\nonly be fully realized through international cooperation\r\nand support.\r\nThe efforts undertaken so far by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, funds and programmes and the\r\nCommission for Social Development in follow-up to the\r\nSummit are encouraging. Collaboration and coordination\r\namong the various United Nations bodies is an important\r\nelement in the successful implementation of the Summit\r\ngoals. In this context, we are pleased to note that in his\r\nreform proposals the Secretary-General has emphasized\r\nthe importance to be given to the development activities\r\nof the United Nations system. We hope that the process\r\nof consolidating economic and social development\r\nactivities will contribute significantly to the realization of\r\nthe goal of social and people-centred sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nThe scourge of poverty that tragically afflicts an\r\noverwhelming proportion of the world\u0027s population\r\ncontinues to arrest the attainment of social development and\r\nsocial justice. Poverty eradication is a complex challenge,\r\nbut one on which we must continue to focus our attention.\r\nOur collective commitment to alleviate and ultimately\r\neradicate poverty must be sustained and consolidated in\r\nconcrete, durable and integrated policies for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. As Malta stated during the recent general\r\ndebate in the Assembly:\r\n“It is time to act firmly and unequivocally to halt the\r\naggravation of this situation, which is fast becoming\r\na latent source of political instability in the world.”\r\n[Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-\r\nsecond Session, Plenary Meetings, 13th meeting, p. 9]\r\nIn addressing the issue of social and economic\r\ndevelopment, we cannot lose sight of the human dimension.\r\nA nation\u0027s potential to develop cannot be fully or only\r\nrealized by economic growth alone. Quality of life is not\r\nsolely dependent on a nation\u0027s economic wealth.\r\nThe human-development approach to addressing cross-\r\ncutting socio-economic problems has been emphasized time\r\nand again. This human-development perspective focuses on\r\nthe concepts of participation, empowerment and solidarity.\r\nPartnership between public and non-governmental sectors\r\nof society is also a key element in socio-economic growth\r\nand development.\r\nMalta firmly believes that the human being is central\r\nto any development strategy. This implies that people\r\ncannot be denied the right to live in freedom and dignity.\r\nThe well-being of the individual must therefore be a well-\r\ndefined target.\r\nTargeting policies at the most vulnerable groups of\r\nsociety — children, women, the elderly, the disadvantaged,\r\nthe poor, the disabled — is, moreover, a prerequisite for the\r\nsuccessful realization of social justice, equity and respect\r\nfor human dignity. In this context, we look forward to the\r\nforthcoming session of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment, on which Malta is honoured to serve, which\r\nwill address the priority theme of promoting the social\r\nintegration and participation of all people, including\r\ndisadvantaged and vulnerable groups and persons. We also\r\nattach great importance to the outcome of the World\r\nConference of Ministers for Youth, to be held in Lisbon, as\r\nwell as the 1999 International Year of Older Persons, which\r\nwill promote the theme of a society for all ages.\r\nMalta believes that quality of opportunity for all\r\ncitizens in all spheres of human activity must be the\r\nstarting point of any political strategy for the future. The\r\nvision guiding my Government in the formulation and\r\nimplementation of its economic and social policies is one\r\nthat emphasizes the need for a social security system\r\nwhich provides citizens with an effective say in exercising\r\ntheir social rights. Social policy is kept in line with\r\npolicies in the fields of education, health, care of the\r\nelderly and housing. Social justice is guaranteed by giving\r\nparticular attention to the more vulnerable or marginalized\r\nmembers of society.\r\nLegislation ensures employment, education, health\r\nand other social benefits without any discrimination on\r\nthe basis of gender or disability. Special attention is\r\naccorded to the elderly, to single-parent families, to those\r\nserving or who have served a prison sentence and their\r\nfamilies, and to rehabilitated drug abusers. Programmes\r\nof coordination and initiatives aimed at offering the best\r\npossibility to people with special needs are also a priority\r\nconcern.\r\nMy Government is also committed to allowing space\r\nfor our youth to attain a pre-eminent role in society. The\r\nparticipation of young people in decision-making and in\r\ncurrent social values should be increased through\r\nparticipation in entities involved in the social and\r\neconomic running of the country.\r\nThe challenge of securing a world free from\r\ndeprivation and marginalization must remain paramount\r\nto our Organization. The priorities and objectives\r\nidentified at Copenhagen require holistic strategies\r\nunderpinned by a spirit of cooperation, solidarity,\r\ndialogue and partnership within and among nations and\r\nregions. Through a concerted mobilization of political will\r\nand resources, through multilateral and bilateral\r\nassistance, a difference can surely be made.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): A few days ago in the Third\r\nCommittee, we had the privilege of a highly stimulating\r\nand thought-provoking introduction by Mr. Nitin Desai,\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for the newly constituted\r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs, on the basic\r\nissues bearing on economic and social development facing\r\nthe international community at the present juncture. The\r\nissues he articulated — the imperative of development\r\ncooperation based on common concerns; shared values;\r\nsolidarity and responsibility to each other; the need for\r\nmore resolute action at the international level to address\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nthe problem of widening global inequalities and\r\nmarginalization — are issues that require broad debate.\r\nAs stated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action:\r\n“in a world of increasing globalization and\r\ninterdependence among countries, national efforts need\r\nto be buttressed by international cooperation”.\r\n[A/CONF.166/9, para. 42]\r\nFor a large number of developing countries, the core issues\r\nof poverty eradication, productive employment and social\r\nintegration cannot be addressed credibly without adequate\r\nresources, non-discriminatory access to markets and\r\navailability of relevant technologies. The question of\r\nconstraints of available resources at the national level\r\ncannot be ignored. Social development requires investments.\r\nAt low per capita income levels, even with the best political\r\nwill and expenditure policies, sufficient resources cannot be\r\nmobilized for all the programmes outlined at the Summit.\r\nThe domestic resources needed for social development can\r\nbe mobilized only if the economy is growing rapidly.\r\nBut the issue is not merely one of resources. It is also\r\na question of structural changes which integrate the social\r\ndimension — poverty eradication, gender mainstreaming,\r\nemployment, social inclusion — into the main framework\r\nof policy. Without a supportive external economic\r\nenvironment that includes cooperation in the formulation\r\nand implementation of macroeconomic policies, trade\r\nliberalization, mobilization of new and additional financial\r\nresources, financial stability, more equitable access of\r\ndeveloping countries to global markets, and productive\r\ninvestment in technologies, our efforts would be akin to\r\ntrying to roll uphill. In the context of our statement on the\r\nworld economic situation in the Second Committee earlier\r\nthis week, our delegation had occasion to refer to a paradox\r\naccording to which, while significant parts of the\r\ndeveloping world are increasingly emerging as locomotives\r\nof world growth, this has not been adequately reflected in\r\ntheir enhanced participation in rule-setting or decision-\r\nmaking processes.\r\nThe priority theme for 1997 in the follow-up to the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development is productive\r\nemployment and sustainable livelihoods. The thirty-fifth\r\nsession of the Commission for Social Development, which\r\ndebated this subject earlier this year, had the benefit of a\r\ncomprehensive paper prepared by the International Labour\r\nOrganization on the subject. The report touched on the\r\ncentrality of employment in policy formulation, including\r\na broader recognition of work and employment; improving\r\naccess to productive resources and infrastructure; and\r\nenhanced quality of work and employment. On that\r\noccasion, we pointed out that the elaboration of global\r\nconcepts and categories in use in the sphere of social\r\ndevelopment in general, and in the subject of\r\nemployment, unemployment, underemployment and\r\nproductive livelihoods in particular, needed to appreciate\r\nbetter the diversity of economic circumstances in different\r\nparts of the world, the differences between circumstances\r\nin the developed and developing world, and the variety of\r\nresponses possible. While broad concepts are valid,\r\nimportant differences in the details have significant policy\r\nimplications.\r\nFor example, there is a general understanding that\r\npoverty is related to unemployment. While it is true that\r\nthere is a close correlation between the two, statistics of\r\nunemployment or underemployment can often reveal or\r\nconceal crucial variations. In India, for example, where\r\nthe overwhelming proportion of the work force is engaged\r\nin the unorganized or informal sector — which should not\r\nbe confused with the illegal sector, as has sometimes been\r\ndone — the extent of unemployment or underemployment\r\nmeasured by the criterion of time spent at work is\r\nrelatively low. An unemployment rate of approximately\r\n2 per cent and an underemployment rate of approximately\r\n3 to 4 per cent may exist along with an incidence of\r\npoverty ranging between 30 to 40 per cent.\r\nA recognition of this idea has profound implications\r\nfor policy formulation. The concept of employment has\r\nbeen dominated by the image of the formal or organized\r\nsector with a concomitant accent on quality of work and\r\nemployment. However, in many developing countries the\r\nformal or organized sector is less important than the\r\ninformal or unorganized sector, and its potential for\r\ngrowth is under-exploited. In fact, the informal sector can\r\noften be an area of economic dynamism and growth. For\r\nexample, in India liberalization and market-led growth has\r\nresulted in an increase in the proportion of casual labour\r\nin the labour market, parallel with an annual growth rate\r\nof over 6 per cent and expanding work availability.\r\nWhat such paradoxical figures point to are really two\r\nbroad realities. The first is the key role of the self-\r\nemployed, who constitute an overwhelmingly large\r\nproportion of this informal sector. In the face of such vast\r\nnumbers in the category of self-employed and in the\r\ninformal sector, concepts of job security or employability\r\nsecurity and even labour standards appear less relevant\r\nthan the question of livelihood security.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\nThe fundamental challenge of unemployment cannot\r\nbe met by the formal sector alone. Employment generation\r\nneeds to be developed hand in hand with generation of\r\nlivelihood. For large sections in search of employment, self-\r\nemployment opportunities need to be expanded. Livelihood\r\nsecurity can be improved only by improving the overall\r\nenvironment in which self-employment — which in turn\r\ncan become a building block for entrepreneurship and for\r\nthe development of the formal sector — can flourish.\r\nAn enabling environment that can provide self-\r\nemployment and livelihood security requires access to basic\r\ninfrastructure, credit, technology and training. Above all,\r\nthey need supportive rules and regulations, and also public\r\nexpenditure on health, education, basic minimum needs and\r\nservices and a stable and growing market. Labour standards\r\napply more meaningfully in a relationship between\r\nemployers and employees than among the self-employed.\r\nThe disjunction between low measurable levels of\r\nunemployment and a high incidence of poverty also points\r\nto the fact that very often the major cause of poverty has\r\nmore to do with low productivity and low income from\r\nwhat is produced. Strategies that focus on expanding work\r\nopportunities while raising productivity and incomes can\r\nplay a formidable role in meeting the challenge of\r\neradicating poverty and unemployment in developing\r\ncountries. This can be done through raising agricultural\r\nproductivity and providing a favourable environment for the\r\ninformal sector. An important strategy in this connection is\r\nto encourage social mobilization processes, organizing\r\npeople in small self-help groups and encouraging group\r\nactivities with the active involvement of non-governmental\r\norganizations and necessary support structures. Such\r\ncooperative structures can also overcome problems of scale,\r\nas well as provide access to credit and markets.\r\nThe example of the Self-Employed Women\u0027s\r\nAssociation, or SEWA — an acronym meaning service —\r\nand many others in India and South Asia which have\r\nbrought together poor and often illiterate women in a\r\nnetwork of cooperative employment, shows that self-help\r\ngroups of women supported by non-governmental\r\norganizations have been found to be particularly successful\r\nin this regard. Supporting such groups through micro-credit\r\nand other schemes can address issues of feminization of\r\npoverty and women\u0027s economic empowerment, besides\r\nbroader concerns of the eradication of poverty and\r\nunemployment and the provision of food security and basic\r\nsocial services.\r\nRaising the productivity of agricultural labour is of\r\nparticular importance to developing countries. Both the\r\n1997 Human Development Report and the 1997 United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development report\r\nLeast Developed Countries have dwelt on the need to\r\nprioritize the agricultural sector — which constitutes the\r\nmost important economic activity in most developing\r\ncountries including the least developed countries — in\r\norder to increase productivity and income, reduce poverty,\r\nexpand markets and stimulate the agro-processing\r\nindustry, which could in turn enhance employment\r\nopportunities in both urban and rural areas, and on which\r\nsocial development is also crucially dependent. The\r\nreports also highlight how enhancing the efficiency of the\r\nagricultural sector could be a prelude to greater\r\nindustrialization in Africa and the least developed\r\ncountries, as has been the case in the more advanced\r\ndeveloping countries of Asia. India has always been\r\nprepared to share its experiences of the Green Revolution\r\nwith the countries of the developing world, in particular\r\nthose in Africa, the least developed countries and small\r\nisland developing countries.\r\nIndia is about to embark on its ninth Five-Year Plan.\r\nThe new Plan gives the highest priority to attaining full\r\nemployment and eradicating poverty. While India is\r\nforging ahead with its policy of economic reform and\r\nliberalization, public policy is being re-oriented towards\r\nsupporting agricultural growth, building up infrastructure\r\nand ensuring universal access to basic minimum services\r\nlike health, education, drinking water, food and nutrition,\r\nshelter and so on.\r\nOur strategy for achieving these goals is based on a\r\npeople-centred approach that attempts to strengthen\r\nparticipation at the grass roots level by providing for\r\ndecentralized, participatory, village-level democratic\r\ninstitutions with statutory representation for women and\r\nsocially disadvantaged groups of people. It is our resolve\r\nto place the concerns of gender, the rights and interests of\r\nthe child, and the potential of the girl child and of youth,\r\nat the centre of all our decision-making. Indeed, the Plan\r\nwill give special emphasis to creating equal opportunities\r\nfor women and also to other socially disadvantaged or\r\neconomically vulnerable categories or groups. Affirmative\r\naction and encouragement and support for\r\nnon-governmental organizations form key components of\r\nthis strategy.\r\nTo conclude, the short history of the world since the\r\nend of Second World War alone has seen dramatic\r\nchanges in developmental models. The paradigms of\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ndevelopment that placed the State at the centre have\r\nretreated. There is now a tendency to put an unfettered\r\nmarket system alone at the centre of the new orthodoxy of\r\nthings. Internationalism has given way to globalization. The\r\nprevailing ethic propounds a retreat of the State from the\r\neconomy. Yet the responsibility for social development\r\nmust, of necessity, fall on the State.\r\nThere is at the same time a recognition of the need for\r\napproaches that blend social justice with economic growth\r\nand the imperatives of the market with social and\r\nenvironmental concerns. Neither the State nor the market\r\nmerit paramountcy over people. And it is to this centrality\r\nof people in the development process, and the\r\ncircumstances of people in developing countries in\r\nparticular, that our delegation would like to see greater\r\nsensitivity.\r\nMr. Gorita (Romania): My country subscribes to the\r\nstatement made today by the delegation of Luxembourg on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. I will focus, therefore, on\r\ncertain specific issues.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development —\r\norganized two years ago in a post-cold-war international\r\nenvironment characterized by profound social, economic\r\nand political changes and increasing globalization —\r\nrepresented a milestone in the history of international\r\ncooperation. It provided a coherent vision of the\r\nmultidimensional nature of social reality and emphasized\r\nthe interdependence between social development, economic\r\ngrowth and environmental protection as mutually\r\nreinforcing facets of sustainable development.\r\nThe generous principles and values furthered by the\r\nSocial Summit, which placed the human dimension at the\r\ncentre of socio-economic debates and highlighted the\r\nimportance of international responsibility and solidarity,\r\nenjoyed a strong political commitment on the part of the\r\nUnited Nations Member States.\r\nRomania welcomes the progress achieved so far at the\r\nnational and international levels in the follow-up process,\r\nas noted in the current report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit.\r\nWe share the view that while Governments bear the\r\nprimary responsibility in translating into facts the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, all\r\nactors of civil society should also participate in different\r\nstages of policy formulation and implementation. At the\r\nsame time, it is essential that these national strategies for\r\nsocial development continue to be supported through\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and other multilateral\r\ninstitutions. Likewise, ensuring an adequate mobilization\r\nof financial resources remains an important prerequisite\r\nfor attaining the goals of the Copenhagen Summit.\r\nI should like to refer briefly to the functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations follow-up trilateral mechanism, which\r\ncomprises the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment — and in particular to the latter component.\r\nRomania deems it necessary that this mechanism\r\ncontinue its efforts to integrate and coordinate the\r\nimplementation of the Social Summit with the follow-up\r\nof other major conferences by enhancing cooperation\r\namong intergovernmental bodies, the relevant departments\r\nof the United Nations Secretariat and United Nations\r\nfunds and programmes. We believe that the Economic\r\nand Social Council can play an increased role to this\r\neffect by further strengthening its function of coordination\r\nand facilitating the dialogue of Governments with civil\r\nsociety and United Nations agencies.\r\nAs for the Commission for Social Development,\r\nrecognized as the functional body entrusted with the\r\nprimary responsibility for the follow-up to the Summit, it\r\nhas proceeded, through a restructured agenda,\r\nsystematically to review the implementation of the\r\nCopenhagen commitments based on the three core themes\r\nof poverty alleviation, employment and social integration.\r\nAt its thirty-fifth session, held last March and which I had\r\nthe honour to chair, the Commission considered the\r\npriority theme of productive employment and sustainable\r\nlivelihood. A set of agreed conclusions on this topic was\r\nadopted by the Commission as a result of the strenuous\r\nefforts of all delegations, the effective support of the\r\nDivision for Social Policy and Development and the\r\nvaluable contribution of the International Labour\r\nOrganization. This document, which emphasizes that the\r\nobjectives of full employment and higher rates of\r\nproductive employment are essential for eradicating\r\npoverty and ensuring social equity and cohesion, contains\r\nuseful references for Governments in their endeavours to\r\nput into practice the Copenhagen outcome.\r\nSocial development has consistently been a priority\r\nfor Romania. Over the past years, Romanian social\r\npolicies have been pursued in the context of the profound\r\ndemocratic transformations which have taken place in my\r\ncountry. Likewise, in keeping with a modern, integrated\r\nconcept, the Romanian Government has approached social\r\nissues in close relation with economic growth and the\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 16 October 1997\r\ncomplex factors involved in sustainable human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Declaration and Programme of Action of the\r\nSocial Summit have provided the basis for the further\r\nreview and development of social strategies and laws in\r\nRomania. Since the Copenhagen Summit, Romania has\r\nreinforced its activities aimed at raising living standards,\r\nalleviating poverty and enhancing social integration, mainly\r\nfor the most vulnerable groups. Moreover, particular\r\nattention has been paid to improving employment in\r\ngeneral, providing higher labour productivity and\r\ncompetitiveness, and encouraging job creation.\r\nAn important objective of my Government\u0027s policy\r\nis at present targeted towards modernizing the\r\nemployment-related legislative and institutional\r\nframework. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that the\r\nlaw on the protection of the unemployed has recently\r\nbeen amended. Furthermore, the setting up of two\r\nspecialized institutions — the National Employment\r\nAgency and the National Training Board — is well under\r\nway. These will operate on the basis of social partnership\r\nand will design and implement policies relating to the\r\nlabour market, to the social protection of the unemployed\r\nand to professional redirection. This project is being\r\ncarried out with the support of the World Bank.\r\nIn the context of speeding up economic reform and\r\nprivatization in Romania, an extensive programme on\r\nlabour force redistribution is being drafted in order to\r\nlower the social costs of reform. It provides for, inter\r\nalia, the creation of focal points for employment\r\nconsulting and support in the restructured enterprises. In\r\naddition, technical and financial assistance projects,\r\nincluding for vocational training, will be implemented to\r\nbenefit local communities with high rates of\r\nunemployment. All of these projects attach special\r\nimportance to youth training and access to jobs. Likewise,\r\nspecific arrangements have been made for encouraging\r\nemployers to hire young graduates.\r\nBearing in mind the impact of social development\r\nissues on young people and the fact that they are the key\r\nagents for social change, I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to welcome the initiative of Portugal to\r\norganize a 1998 world conference of Ministers\r\nresponsible for youth, in cooperation with the United\r\nNations. I should also like to express my country\u0027s wish\r\nto participate actively in its preparation and proceedings.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m.\r\n30\r\n"
