(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 22\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the Agency\r\nfor Cultural and Technical Cooperation\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/299 and\r\nAdd.1 and 2)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.1)\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of France\r\nto introduce draft resolution A/52/L.1.\r\nMr. Dejammet (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nTwo years ago the General Assembly adopted without a\r\nvote resolution 50/3, entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation”.\r\nI have the honour, on behalf of the francophone group\r\nin New York, to submit another draft resolution under this\r\nagenda item. This draft resolution demonstrates that the\r\ncooperation engaged in for two years under resolution 50/3\r\nhas been fruitful and has great potential for development.\r\nMay I add that the 41 sponsors of the draft resolution\r\nhave been joined by Cape Verde, Poland, Seychelles and\r\nTunisia.\r\nThe relationship begun in 1978, with the granting of\r\nobserver status to the Agency, has flourished remarkably\r\nover the last two years. The pattern was set by several\r\nfirm commitments, in particular a first cooperation\r\nagreement between the Agency and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) in 1976. Then there was an agreement with\r\nthe United Nations Industrial Development Organization\r\n(UNIDO) in 1990. Participation by the Agency in United\r\nNations activities, and vice versa, has made it possible to\r\nbetter ascertain and appreciate resources available to serve\r\ncommon interests and objectives. We welcome the\r\nopening of an office of the Agency in New York in May\r\n1995, which has contributed a great deal to this\r\nharmonization.\r\nFollowing the adoption of resolution 50/3, on 16\r\nOctober 1995, a cooperation framework agreement was\r\nconcluded with the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) on 26 October of that year, and in October\r\n1996 an agreement was concluded with the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), an agreement\r\ncontaining several development projects and programmes\r\nfor implementation.\r\nSince then the seal has been set on these agreements\r\nby the signing, on 25 June 1997, by the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and the Agency of a\r\ncooperation agreement between the two organizations. On\r\n8 September 1997 a similar agreement was signed\r\nbetween the Office of the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights and the Agency.\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nThese agreements signal new, encouraging prospects.\r\nOn the ground, joint actions taken by the Agency and\r\nUNICEF or UNDP make possible the creation of a synergy,\r\nof resources and personnel, in the service of development.\r\nAction with UNICEF includes an education and\r\nliteracy programme for girls and young women in rural\r\nareas in Benin, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Mauritania and Viet\r\nNam; a plan for basic education for displaced or poor\r\nfamilies in Djibouti; a primary education programme in\r\nViet Nam; and a technical assistance programme in Haiti to\r\ntrain teachers and principals and to provide teaching\r\nmaterials and resources.\r\nThe cooperation agreement with UNDP is intended, in\r\nparticular, to strengthen the rule of law; to promote and\r\nprotect human rights; to support the democratic process and\r\ngood governance; to organize and strengthen national\r\ncapacities; and to improve the economic development of the\r\ncountries of the South, with, among other things, support\r\nfor the establishment and management of small and\r\nmedium-sized enterprises.\r\nWe must welcome this complementarity, through\r\neffective coordination, whose fruits are being seen on the\r\nground, to the benefit of the people that need them. This\r\nenhances the visibility and credibility of the promoters of\r\nthese projects.\r\nThe partnership between the United Nations and the\r\nAgency has taken on a new dimension with the signing on\r\n25 June of the cooperation agreement by the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and the Agency. The\r\nagreement expands cooperation to new fields, such as\r\npreventive diplomacy, the maintenance and consolidation of\r\npeace and, pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 50/3, all\r\nsubjects of common interest in the political, economic,\r\nsocial, scientific and cultural fields. The agreement also\r\ncovers exchange of information and documentation.\r\nFinally, we welcome the most recent agreement,\r\nconcluded with the Office of the High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights on 8 September, which puts the emphasis on\r\njoint actions to strengthen the rule of law, and protect\r\nhuman rights — particularly the rights of women and the\r\nrights of the child — and wage the campaign against\r\nracism, racial discrimination and xenophobia. This\r\nagreement gives concrete expression to, and strengthens,\r\ncooperation which has existed for several years already,\r\nparticularly through training seminars, where the expertise\r\nacquired by the Agency can be put to good use.\r\nThe types of cooperation developed between the\r\nAgency and the United Nations are not limited to these\r\nagreements. Dialogue and reciprocal representation, in\r\nparticular, have a part to play.\r\nHere I should like to stress the contribution made by\r\nthe francophone group during the preparations for the\r\nnineteenth special session of the General Assembly, on\r\nsustainable development, which made it possible to\r\nachieve consensus between countries with very different\r\npolitical, geographical, cultural and social circumstances,\r\nsince that is the mission of francophonie. We hope that\r\nthis positive and profitable experience can be repeated\r\nduring the preparations for the ministerial conference on\r\nwater to be held next spring in Paris.\r\nMay I also mention the expansion of this\r\ncooperation to electoral assistance to francophone\r\ncountries, which led to a very productive meeting a few\r\nweeks ago.\r\nHowever, we have not exhausted all the possibilities\r\nfor partnership. New interests have recently emerged in\r\nthe Department of Political Affairs, the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations, and the Department for\r\nEconomic and Social Affairs of the Secretariat. The\r\nprospects for cooperation have much to offer.\r\nAs I speak before the General Assembly, and on the\r\neve of the Hanoi summit which will bring together many\r\nof the States represented in this Hall, it gives me great\r\nsatisfaction to stress the contribution to the objectives\r\npursued here made by bodies that represent French-\r\nspeaking countries, in particular, their Agency which, I\r\nmight add will adopt in Hanoi the title of Agency for the\r\nFrench-Speaking Community.\r\nUndoubtedly, the success of this cooperation is\r\npartly due to the rationalization and synergy of the\r\nresources it is creating. This cooperation helps avoid any\r\nuseless and costly duplication.\r\nAlso, such is the dynamism of multilateralism when\r\nit harnesses a network of solidarity to work for the same\r\nideals and when it thus nurtures cooperation. The\r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Agency has borne fruit and still contains an\r\nabundance of new projects.\r\nWe therefore hope that these promises will\r\nmaterialize in the next two years. For this reason, we\r\nthank all the Member States for supporting the draft\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nresolution so that a review of these new achievements can\r\nbe included in the report that we call upon the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit to us at the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)\r\n(interpretation from French): The Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation (ACTC), which was established on\r\n20 March 1970 in Niamey in the Republic of the Niger,\r\nwas born of an ideal — that of bringing together countries\r\nthat use French as a common language in a joint endeavour,\r\nand seems to express a new solidarity and a further element\r\nin rapprochement between peoples through constant\r\ndialogue among civilizations.\r\nToday, 27 years after the ACTC was established, it\r\nhas a membership of 47 States and Governments. As a\r\nmeeting point for dialogue between Africa, America, Asia\r\nand Europe, the primary mandate of this unique\r\nintergovernmental organization for French-speaking\r\ncountries is to affirm and develop multilateral cooperation\r\nbetween its members in the fields of education and training,\r\nculture and communications, energy, the environment,\r\nagriculture, economic development, scientific information,\r\nand support for democracy and the rule of law.\r\nThe relationship between the Agency and the United\r\nNations is not a new one. It already goes back a number of\r\nyears. In 1978, the ACTC was granted observer status by\r\nthe General Assembly, thus enabling it to take part as an\r\nobserver in all the conferences and meetings held under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations.\r\nSince then, the ACTC has participated in the regular\r\nsessions of the General Assembly and the meetings of its\r\nsubsidiary bodies that deal with issues of particular interest\r\nto its activities. In addition, it has also taken part in several\r\nmajor conferences, namely the World Summit for Children,\r\nthe Earth Summit, the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, the World Food Conference, and so on.\r\nAt the same time, while we, the French-speaking\r\ncommunity are actively preparing for the forthcoming\r\nfrancophone summit in Hanoi, we welcome the fact that the\r\nrelationship between the Agency and the organizations of\r\nthe United Nations system continues to develop.\r\nIn the field of education and culture, the Agency and\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) are collaborating closely to\r\nimplement programmes of interest to both organizations,\r\nsuch as basic education, teacher training, distance learning\r\nand so forth. The Agency signed a framework agreement\r\nwith the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization (UNIDO) in 1990 which provides for the\r\nimplementation of joint projects in the areas of energy,\r\nindustrial technology, the establishment and management\r\nof small and medium-sized enterprises, feasibility studies,\r\nthe promotion of investment, and so forth.\r\nThe Agency has also concluded cooperation\r\nagreements with the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) and the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) in areas\r\nwhere they have specific interests in common.\r\nIn short, cooperation between the ACTC and the\r\nUnited Nations has developed considerably, particularly\r\nin the last two years since the adoption of General\r\nAssembly resolution 50/3. We very much hope that this\r\ncooperation will be strengthened even further, in the\r\ninterest of both organizations and of peace and\r\ninternational cooperation. For its part, the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic will spare no effort to promote this\r\nfruitful cooperation.\r\nMr. Boisson (Monaco) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe Principality of Monaco, as a member of the Agency\r\nfor Cultural and Technical Cooperation since it was set up\r\nin 1970 in Niamey, particularly welcomes the\r\ndevelopment and strengthening of cooperation between\r\nthis institution which brings together States and\r\nGovernments that use French as a common language, and\r\nthe United Nations, which has from the outset accorded\r\nthe French language its due status as a language of\r\ndiplomacy. As one of the two working languages of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat and one of the six official\r\nlanguages of its bodies, the French language, which is\r\nalso the language of the Agency, has paved the way for\r\nthe establishment and subsequent development of\r\ncooperation between these two intergovernmental\r\norganizations.\r\nIn 1978, in its resolution 33/18, the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly had already taken account of this\r\nspecial feature and the potential it offered by inviting the\r\nAgency to participate in its sessions and the meetings of\r\nits subsidiary bodies as an observer.\r\nIn this capacity, the Agency has been able to be\r\nassociated with and contribute to the major world\r\nconferences convened by the United Nations, such as the\r\nWorld Summit for Children in 1990, the Earth Summit in\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\n1992, the World Conference on Human Rights and the\r\nTokyo International Conference on African Development in\r\n1993, the World Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment in 1995, the Second United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements, HABITAT II, in 1996\r\nand the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly\r\nin June this year.\r\nIn each case, preparatory meetings and working groups\r\nenabled the francophone world to speak with one voice on\r\na series of questions, which facilitated our search for\r\ncompromise on texts that were often essential, because of\r\ntheir nature and their scope.\r\nThis cooperation is fully in keeping with the\r\nconstitutional mandate of both organizations: the promotion\r\nof peace, international security, democracy and economic\r\nand social development.\r\nThe Agency’s objectives, defined in article I of its\r\nCharter, revised and adopted in Marrakesh last December,\r\ninclude assisting in the establishment and development of\r\ndemocracy; the prevention of conflicts; support for the state\r\nof law and human rights; enhancement of the dialogue\r\nbetween cultures and civilizations; bringing peoples together\r\nthrough enhancing their knowledge of each other; and,\r\nfinally, strengthening the solidarity of its members through\r\nmultilateral cooperation in order to promote their economic\r\nexpansion.\r\nThe cooperation agreement, officially signed on 25\r\nJune 1997 by the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, and the Secretary-General of the Agency,\r\nMr. Jean-Louis Roy, has, by making it official, confirmed\r\nthe determination of the two institutions to work together.\r\nThe Agreement has already led to consultations — in\r\nParis last June, and in Libreville last July — between the\r\ntwo organizations on the crises in certain African countries,\r\nprimarily in the Great Lakes region. With regard to\r\nelectoral assistance, the Agency has developed a well-\r\nknown expertise, based both on its own experience and on\r\nthat of the non-governmental organizations with which it\r\nhas worked for many years with confidence and\r\neffectiveness. It has also provided regular assistance, along\r\nwith the United Nations and regional organizations, to the\r\nStates that request it.\r\nAlong the same lines, and given their athletic and\r\ncultural nature, the francophone games — the third round\r\nof which has just been held in Madagascar — have been\r\nthe occasion for young athletes and artists from 36\r\ncountries of the francophone community to come together\r\nin peaceful and friendly competition, designed to develop\r\namong them trust and solidarity beyond borders. The\r\nregular holding of these games, which are held in a\r\ndifferent State each time, undoubtedly enhances mutual\r\nunderstanding among the participants and thus promotes\r\npeace and international understanding.\r\nThis cooperation also extends to activities of prime\r\nimportance to my Government, namely, good governance,\r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights and the\r\nestablishment of the state of law, as well as support for\r\nthe democratization process and the improvement of\r\njudiciary systems and interparliamentary cooperation.\r\nThe Agency and its International School play a\r\nconsiderable role in this respect through training and\r\nawareness programmes for political authorities,\r\nmagistrates, policemen, teachers and students, in\r\nworkshops, seminars and internships. Their actions, which\r\nsupport and are complementary to those of the United\r\nNations, deserve more than ever to be emphasized and\r\nencouraged.\r\nOn 8 September last, a framework agreement for\r\ncooperation was drawn up between the Agency and the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights. It will certainly lead to the further\r\ndevelopment of common initiatives in these key areas.\r\nHarmonious and lasting economic and social\r\ndevelopment with respect for the dignity of humankind\r\nand its deepest aspirations is one of the basic objectives\r\nthe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation shares\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nThe well-targeted and practical activities developed\r\nin this regard in the fields of new and renewable sources\r\nof energy, the transfer of technologies and the\r\nmanagement of natural resources in order to protect the\r\nenvironment should also be increased in the future\r\nthrough strengthened cooperation between the two\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThe human dimension of development and of\r\nintergovernmental cooperation is broadly taken into\r\naccount, and often in a very original way, by the Agency,\r\nwhich promotes initiatives to bring its partners together\r\non the basis of multilingualism and multiculturalism.\r\nThe Market for African Art and Entertainment,\r\nwhich the Agency launched in 1993, is an example of the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\ndetermination of those involved in cooperation among\r\nfrancophone countries to see their projects not only in\r\neconomic terms but also from the perspective of cultural\r\nand intellectual enrichment.\r\nThe draft intergovernmental convention on culture is\r\nanother example, as well as a symbol, of this. The first\r\ntruly standardizing measure to be taken by the States and\r\nGovernments that are members of the Agency, it was\r\ncarefully drawn up in accordance with the mandate\r\ndelivered by the summit of Heads of State and Government\r\nin Cotonou in December 1995 and by the Conference of\r\nMinisters of French-speaking Countries in February 1996.\r\nThe text provides, in particular, for the commitment of\r\nsignatory countries to provide financial and technical\r\nassistance for the creation and collective management of\r\nroyalties and related rights, in order to facilitate the\r\ndissemination of works by authors, interpreters or\r\nperformers, in keeping with the Rome Convention of 1961,\r\nas well as by any individual deemed to be such by the\r\nlegislation of a signing State.\r\nThis matter naturally leads me to emphasize that\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Agency\r\ntakes place at several levels and across the whole of the\r\nUnited Nations system, including specialized agencies as\r\ndifferent as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) or the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization.\r\nUNESCO and the francophone Agency work together\r\nvery closely, for example, on implementing certain\r\nprogrammes of the International Fund for the Promotion of\r\nthe Study of African Languages and Cultures, programmes\r\nwhich recognize the place and role of vernacular languages\r\nalongside a lingua franca, as a factor of development and\r\nidentity.\r\nOn the basis of the cooperation agreement signed in\r\n1976 between the two intergovernmental institutions, and\r\nstrengthened in 1990 by an additional protocol creating a\r\njoint consultative commission, joint operational activities\r\nare regularly carried out by UNESCO and the Agency in\r\nthe areas of basic education, education for adults, and after-\r\nschool education — the very foundations of an economic\r\nand social development that truly takes into account the\r\nhuman dimension of progress.\r\nFor the Agency as well as for UNESCO, development\r\nis multidimensional; it cannot be reduced to economic\r\ngrowth alone. Economy, culture, education, science and\r\ntechnology are individual elements, certainly, but they are\r\ncomplementary and interdependent, and development per\r\nse, centred on men and women and their true needs, can\r\nbe ensured only by focusing on all those elements\r\ntogether.\r\nAs we commemorate today the International Day for\r\nthe Eradication of Poverty and pay tribute to those who\r\nsuffer from it, we cannot overlook the fact that\r\ndevelopment and progress cannot be reduced to the\r\nimplementation of macroeconomic theories but must, as\r\na priority, be directed, through concrete and tangible\r\nactions, towards the neediest and most deprived on every\r\ncontinent. That is the message transmitted to us by Father\r\nJoseph Wresinski, the founder of ADT Fourth World,\r\nwhich promoted this International Day for the Eradication\r\nof Poverty.\r\nThat is the message that the principal figures in\r\ndevelopment assistance today have understood in\r\nundertaking to promote simple, practical and workable\r\nprojects in tune with the daily demands of the\r\ncommunities with which they are concerned. That is the\r\noption that the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation and the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO) have unreservedly\r\nchosen.\r\nThe cooperation agreement that has bound them\r\ntogether since 1990 has facilitated the implementation of\r\npractical projects in the spheres of crafts, agriculture,\r\nfishing, animal husbandry and even the use of solar\r\nenergy.\r\nNor have poor urban areas in both North and South\r\nbeen overlooked. The most vulnerable populations, living\r\nin critically precarious conditions, described by Father\r\nWresinski as the “fourth world”, and which can be found\r\nin every major city, are the focus of studies and seminars\r\nand of projects for training and social integration designed\r\nto improve their standards of living and environment.\r\nLinked to the creation of economic and commercial\r\nactivities adapted to the various areas concerned,\r\nmicroeconomic and microfinance projects supported by\r\nthe Agency and often carried out with the assistance of\r\nlocal bodies like Environmental Development Action in\r\nthe Third World (ENDA) have had beneficial, rapid and\r\nlasting results. We must therefore promote them by\r\nencouraging this timely interagency collaboration.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nRespecting as they do human diversity and its\r\ncontribution to man’s progress and the natural solidarity\r\nthat is based on a shared history, these programmes, we\r\nfeel, are good reflections of the philosophy that underlies\r\nthe cooperation between the United Nations system as a\r\nwhole and the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation.\r\nI think I could find no better argument for urging the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which is always eager to improve the\r\nlives of today’s men and women — and particularly the\r\nneediest among them — on both the material and the\r\nintellectual levels, to adopt the draft resolution before us,\r\nwhich is devoted to such cooperation and of which the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco is a sponsor.\r\nThe adoption of this text will send a welcoming and\r\nencouraging message to the Agency’s partners, who are\r\nalso members of the United Nations and who will in the\r\nvery near future be meeting at the level of Heads of State\r\nand Government in Hanoi, Viet Nam, to renew, inter alia,\r\nthe framework of their cooperation and strengthen their\r\ninstitutions by electing, for the first time, a secretary-\r\ngeneral of the francophone countries.\r\nMr. Tanasescu (Romania) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It is my honour today to speak on behalf of a\r\ncountry whose francophone tradition goes back to the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century. When it became a full\r\nmember of the movement of countries that use French as a\r\ncommon language in 1991, Romania sought to ensure the\r\ncontinuity of its modern cultural tradition, which is deeply\r\nimbued with French spirit and values.\r\nToday’s discussion on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation is taking place at a specific juncture for\r\ncultural developments on the world scale. In the two years\r\nsince we last discussed this subject, the process of the\r\nexpansion of global communications and data networks has\r\naccelerated. That development has created both\r\nopportunities and challenges for the universal culture of the\r\nnext millennium and for the prospects for cultural diversity,\r\nas well as for our cooperation as francophone countries. It\r\nis our common duty and responsibility to transmit over the\r\ninformation superhighway and airwaves the traditional and\r\nmodern values that are strongly linked by the French\r\nlanguage.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on this agenda item\r\n(A/52/299 and Add.1) provides a detailed and\r\ncomprehensive picture of the progress made in recent years\r\nin cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation. I should\r\nlike to indicate a few factors that we feel have made a\r\ndecisive contribution to strengthening that cooperation.\r\nFirst, there is the political support given by the\r\nHeads of State or Government of countries that use\r\nFrench as a common language to the work of the United\r\nNations and their determination to enter into a new\r\npartnership with the various components of the United\r\nNations system. This is an example that demonstrates that\r\npolitical will can bear fruit to the benefit of both\r\norganizations and their memberships.\r\nSecondly, we have in mind the existence of areas of\r\naction and interest that are common to both organizations.\r\nThe complementary nature of certain activities and\r\nprogrammes in which the Agency and the United Nations\r\nare engaged has led to the holding of periodic discussions\r\nbetween their secretariats to identify subjects, measures\r\nand procedures to facilitate their cooperation and\r\ncoordination.\r\nThirdly, we believe that the creation of a legal\r\nframework for such cooperation, through the elaboration\r\nand conclusion of cooperation agreements between the\r\nAgency and several bodies within the United Nations\r\nsystem, has provided a guarantee of the continuity and\r\nlong-term stability of their relationship. We believe that\r\nthe agreement signed on 25 June 1997 by the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of the two organizations is essential to the\r\nstrengthening of such cooperation. Pursuant to the\r\nprovisions of the agreement, the United Nations and the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation may\r\ndecide to act jointly in the implementation of projects that\r\nare of mutual interest, to set up committees or\r\ncommissions to advise them on specific matters, and to\r\nexchange information and documentation.\r\nWe welcome the framework cooperation agreement\r\nsigned between the Agency and the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and are\r\nconvinced that the 1998 fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nwill be celebrated throughout the French-speaking\r\ncountries. This is a moral duty we all owe to\r\nJean-Jacques Rousseau and to all the heroes who have\r\ndied over the course of time defending his ideals.\r\nThe last factor that has contributed to the current\r\nlevel of cooperation between the two organizations is the\r\nongoing and sustained work of the ACTC office in New\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nYork, for which we congratulate it most heartily. The\r\ncontinuing consultations begun by the office have facilitated\r\nthe exchange of information and views between the French-\r\nspeaking countries and have allowed several documents of\r\ninterest to those countries to be drafted. The preparations\r\nfor the General Assembly’s special session on the mid-term\r\nreview and appraisal of the overall implementation of\r\nAgenda 21, including the drafting of a document as our\r\ngroup’s contribution to the session, was a defining moment\r\nfor the office’s activities.\r\nIn early September, Bucharest, the capital of my\r\ncountry, hosted the Third International Conference of the\r\nNew or Restored Democracies on Democracy and\r\nDevelopment, organized jointly by my Government and the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme. The Conference’s\r\nspecial topic was the relationship between democracy and\r\ndevelopment. High-level representatives of Governments,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and academic and\r\nuniversity circles from 77 countries — including several\r\nFrench-speaking countries — presented their experiences\r\nand thoughts on the topic and adopted a Conference\r\ndocument that is already available as an official document\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nWe wished to share this information for two reasons.\r\nThe first was to thank the ACTC for its generous\r\ncontribution to the process started by the Conference. The\r\nsecond was to suggest as one possible sphere of\r\ncooperation between us, both as French-speaking countries\r\nand as United Nations Members, the study of our\r\nexperiences in the democratization process. The drafting of\r\nsuch a study, which could be submitted to the next\r\nConference, to be hosted by an African country in the year\r\n2000, would offer a new area for cooperation, not only\r\nbetween our countries, but also between the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation and the United Nations.\r\nOur permanent mission in New York, in cooperation with\r\nthe ACTC office, could initiate consultations in that respect.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe consideration of agenda item 22, entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Agency for Cultural\r\nand Technical Cooperation”, has given Tunisia the pleasant\r\nopportunity to speak on this subject.\r\nThe relationship between the Agency and the United\r\nNations is quite exemplary and dates back to 1978, when\r\nthe General Assembly adopted resolution 33/18, which gave\r\nthat institution observer status, enabling it to take part in\r\nthe work of the Organization and its subsidiary bodies. This\r\nhas allowed the Agency to reaffirm its presence by taking\r\npart not only in the activities in New York, but also in\r\nmajor events in the life of the Organization and its\r\nprincipal agencies over the past six years. Whether at the\r\nWorld Summit for Children in New York in 1990, the\r\nEarth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the World\r\nConference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993, the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\r\nin Cairo in 1994, the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen in Beijing in 1995, or the Second United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) in 1996,\r\nI would stress that the Agency has played an effective\r\nand important role in ensuring coordination and\r\nrapprochement between the positions of its states\r\nmembers. The Agency is indeed a unique organization,\r\nbringing together countries that, while dispersed\r\nthroughout several continents, share a common language\r\nand the noble objectives that unite them despite their\r\ncultural and geographic diversity and their level of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nUnited around a common ideal, the country members\r\nof the Agency see themselves as the expression of a new\r\nsolidarity and an additional factor for bringing peoples\r\ncloser together for ongoing dialogue among civilizations.\r\nThe member countries of the Agency try to reflect this\r\nideal of global solidarity through specific activities in\r\nsuch diverse areas as education, training, culture,\r\ncommunication, energy, environment, agriculture,\r\neconomic development and scientific information, as well\r\nas in support for democracy and the state of law.\r\nThe ambitious civil and development project that\r\nunderlies the Agency’s activities cannot be carried out\r\nproperly without increased international cooperation. That\r\nis why this institution established cooperation agreements\r\nwith the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1976, the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in\r\n1990, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in\r\n1995 and the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) in 1996.\r\nWith UNESCO, in the area of education, the two\r\norganizations focus their activities on basic education and\r\nthe production of teaching materials and manuals. With\r\nUNIDO, cooperation is focused, inter alia, on creating\r\nand managing small- and medium-sized enterprises and\r\npromoting appropriate technologies for developing\r\ncountries. UNICEF and the Agency have established,\r\namong other things, an education and literacy programme\r\nfor young girls and women living in rural areas in\r\ncountries. With UNDP, the framework agreement signed\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nin 1996 led to cooperation in such varied fields as\r\ncooperation assistance among developing countries,\r\neducation, culture, environment and energy.\r\nThe multifaceted cooperation developed by the Agency\r\nwith the specialized agencies was crowned with success\r\nthrough the General Assembly’s adoption in 1996 of\r\nresolution 50/3, which institutionalized cooperation between\r\nthe Agency and the Organization. In accordance with that\r\nthe resolution, the United Nations and the Agency have\r\nworked together on diverse subjects: the development of the\r\nsituation in Central Africa and initiatives undertaken on all\r\nsides to achieve a settlement to the crisis in the region;\r\nelectoral assistance to French-speaking countries; and\r\nsustainable development, including preparations for the\r\nnineteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted\r\nto the implementation of Agenda 21.\r\nAt the same time, the mutual representation of both\r\norganizations at meetings organized by each has increased.\r\nThus, the United Nations Secretary-General took part in the\r\nwork of the fifth summit of Heads of State and Government\r\nof French-speaking countries, held in Cotonou, Benin, in\r\nDecember 1995. The United Nations was also represented\r\nat the Conference of Ministers of French-speaking\r\nCountries working with the information highway and new\r\ninformation technologies, held at Montreal, Canada, in May\r\n1997, as well as at the meeting of the Francophone Contact\r\nGroup on the situation in the Great Lakes region, held in\r\nJune 1997.\r\nToday, the Agency and the French-speaking\r\ncommunity are preparing together to enter a new phase, the\r\noutlines of which will be defined at the upcoming summit\r\nin Hanoi next November. At a time when the United\r\nNations itself is preparing its own reforms in order to meet\r\nthe imminent millennium with the best assets for success,\r\nit is essential to strengthen cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween the two institutions for the good of all parties. The\r\ncooperation agreement signed last June by our two\r\nSecretaries-General aims at that end. The draft resolution\r\nbefore the Assembly, which was submitted this morning by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of France, confirms that\r\nhappy convergence.\r\nTunisia is happy to reaffirm its support for cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Agency for Cultural\r\nand Technical Cooperation. That cooperation highlights the\r\nidentity of views and objectives of the two organizations\r\nand carries on and consolidates the activities of our\r\nOrganization at the regional level, particularly in the area\r\nof development and development cooperation.\r\nMr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): I have the honour to speak in support of\r\nthe valuable ideas contained in the statement made by the\r\nAmbassador of France in introducing draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.1, designed to strengthen cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation (ACTC). Viet Nam highly\r\nappreciates the effective work done by the Agency, which\r\nis why it decided to become a co-sponsor of the draft\r\nresolution, on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation.\r\nOver the last 27 years the ACTC has played an\r\nincreasingly important role in economic and social\r\ndevelopment, which is making a great contribution to the\r\ncommon goals of the countries that have French as a\r\ncommon language. The ACTC is becoming a meeting\r\npoint and focus of cooperation between Africa, America,\r\nAsia and Europe. It brings its members together within\r\nthe great French-speaking family, thus creating an\r\nimportant community which participates in the global\r\ndialogue. It is also an intergovernmental instrument of a\r\nspecial kind which guarantees the success of cooperation\r\nbetween States and Governments of the francophone\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe relationship between the Agency and the United\r\nNations goes back a number of years. In 1978 the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 33/18, inviting the\r\nACTC to participate as an observer in its sessions and in\r\nall conferences convened under its aegis of the Assembly,\r\nas well as in meetings of its subsidiary organs.\r\nFurthermore, a series of cooperation framework\r\nagreements in areas of common interest to the ACTC and\r\nthe subsidiary organs of the United Nations established\r\nthe relationship between the two parties. The adoption by\r\nthe General Assembly of resolution 50/3 gave special\r\nimpetus to that relationship and further strengthened\r\ncooperation between United Nations bodies and the\r\nACTC.\r\nViet Nam is pleased to note that cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations, its specialized agencies and\r\nother United Nations bodies and programmes and the\r\nACTC over the last two years has produced encouraging\r\nachievements in many areas. We are convinced that the\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the ACTC serves not only the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations, but also the current reform process\r\nof the United Nations.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nMr. Jele (South Africa), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nIn particular, the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and the Secretary-General of the ACTC signed a\r\ncooperation agreement on 25 June 1997 to strengthen\r\nrelations between the two intergovernmental organizations,\r\nan agreement marking a new stage in their cooperation.\r\nViet Nam is convinced that it will establish a very solid\r\nbasis for concrete action and the establishment of\r\ncooperation projects in the common interests of member\r\ncountries.\r\nBenefiting from close coordination between the conseil\r\npermanent de la Francophonie, the ACTC and other\r\nfrancophone countries, Viet Nam is preparing to host the\r\nseventh Francophone Summit in Hanoi in November. This\r\nwill be the first time the French-speaking community has\r\nheld its Summit in Asia, a turning point in the history of\r\nfrancophone solidarity. Viet Nam undertakes to do all it can\r\nto make the Summit a success and to welcome Heads of\r\nStates and delegates coming from 49 member countries of\r\nthe francophone community.\r\nIn conclusion, Viet Nam hopes that the United Nations\r\nand the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation will\r\ncontinue to enjoy the new spirit of cooperation created by\r\nresolution 50/3 in order to deepen and expand cooperation\r\nin areas of common interest. My delegation therefore hopes\r\nthat draft resolution A/52/L.1 will receive the support of all\r\nMember States of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Lelong (Haiti) (interpretation from French): The\r\ndelegation of Haiti is pleased to co-sponsor draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.1, entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation”.\r\nThis is an important question, in which we have a great\r\ninterest.\r\nAllow me to recall that Haiti was present at the\r\nNiamey meeting when a group of 21 States and\r\nGovernments with French as a common language concluded\r\non 20 March 1970 the Convention establishing the Agency\r\nfor Cultural and Technical Cooperation. Today, 27 years\r\nlater, our Agency has grown to become the meeting point\r\nfor 49 States and Governments from five continents.\r\nNext November the seventh biennial conference of\r\nHeads of State and Government of the French-speaking\r\ncountries will be held in Hanoi. The holding of this\r\nconference in Asia is a new symbol of the diverse\r\nmembership of our community and of the fact that our\r\nranks continue to grow with every summit.\r\nThis growth is proof of the Agency’s strength and its\r\ncapacity to accomplish its mandate, which is to support\r\nand to develop multilateral cooperation between its\r\nmembers in such areas as education and training, culture\r\nand communications, energy, the environment, agriculture,\r\neconomic development, scientific information and\r\nsupporting democracy and the rule of law.\r\nThe Agency makes its contribution to peace and\r\ndevelopment along with the United Nations and other\r\norganizations. It was in order to highlight the clear\r\ncomplementarity between United Nations and ACTC\r\naction for economic, political and social development that\r\nin 1978, at the thirty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly, the Agency was granted the status of observer,\r\nby resolution 33/18.\r\nIn line with the spirit of its Charter, the ACTC has\r\nestablished a broad and diverse network of relationships\r\nwith the United Nations system. It has played an active\r\nrole in all the conferences and summits organized by the\r\nUnited Nations. For a number of years now it has closely\r\ncooperated with the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in all its wealth of\r\nevents and activities.\r\nA framework agreement concluded with the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)\r\nled to the establishment in 15 French-speaking countries\r\nof industrial development programmes designed to aid\r\npeoples and sustainable human development, with due\r\nregard for conservation of the environment. The ACTC\r\nalso has cooperation agreements with UNICEF and the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in\r\nareas of interest to those two institutions. It has\r\ncooperated with the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights for several years now,\r\nand recently — last September — the two institutions\r\ndecided to give fresh impetus to their relationship by\r\nsigning a new agreement.\r\nIt can be seen that the range of the ACTC’s\r\nactivities is broad, with many aspects. The scale of the\r\nnew challenges facing the international community calls\r\nfor increased coordination of development policies, and to\r\nthis the cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nACTC continues to contribute effectively.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nWe are convinced that adoption of the draft resolution\r\nbefore the Assembly will strengthen this cooperation.\r\nMr. Reyn (Belgium) (interpretation from French):\r\nTwo years ago this Assembly adopted for the first time a\r\nresolution formally recognizing the cooperation between the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation (ACTC)\r\nand the United Nations. The resolution inaugurated a new\r\npartnership, which we welcomed. The ACTC then opened\r\nan office at the United Nations, thus making its presence\r\nmore visible and making it possible to increase cooperation\r\nbetween the French-speaking countries at the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Agency, which is the organ of the French-\r\nspeaking countries, and which is also called the Agency for\r\nthe French-Speaking Community, now includes 44 States\r\nand Governments from four continents. This guarantees that\r\nwithin this centre of francophonie there is a diversity of\r\ncultures and views, which only further highlights the\r\nsolidarity that emerges from the dialogue.\r\nThe primary mission of the ACTC is to promote this\r\ndialogue and to ensure cooperation in education, culture and\r\ncommunications, energy, the environment, agriculture,\r\neconomic development, scientific information and the rule\r\nof law. As the United Nations mission is to deal with these\r\nproblems at the global level, it is logical that there should\r\nbe an exchange between the ACTC and the United Nations\r\nto take advantage of their complementarities.\r\nThis partnership is of long standing. The ACTC has\r\nenjoyed observer status at the United Nations since 1978,\r\nand certain bodies, such as the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the\r\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\r\n(UNIDO) already had cooperation agreements with the\r\nACTC. We are pleased that other bodies have expressed the\r\ndesire for such agreements.\r\nThe ACTC does not have a political mission as such.\r\nHowever, the ideal of francophonie, as formulated in the\r\npreamble to the French-Speaking Community Charter,\r\nadopted in Marrakesh last December, is freedom and human\r\nrights; justice and solidarity; democracy, development and\r\nprogress.\r\nWe believe that in the area of technical support, as\r\nwell as in the organization of seminars bringing together\r\nFrench-speaking countries, the Agency’s contribution can\r\nbe very valuable and open up promising cooperation. The\r\nAgency’s existing legal and judicial cooperation in the\r\nGreat Lakes region is an example of this, and we\r\nencourage the Agency to pursue this work in close\r\ncooperation with the other actors in the field. We are\r\nparticularly pleased by the activities undertaken in the\r\nfield of human rights and by the cooperation agreement\r\nwith the office of the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights.\r\nAgreements have been concluded with the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund as well as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme. We welcome this, as well as\r\nthe ongoing cooperation with the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), which, because of the two bodies’ mutual\r\nfocus on culture and their long collaboration, is one of the\r\nbest examples of such cooperation.\r\nBelgium is a sponsor of the draft resolution that\r\nFrance introduced on this item. We are pleased by the\r\nimpetus that has been given over the last two years to the\r\ncooperation between the Organization and the Agency,\r\nthese two bodies particularly by the signing last June of\r\nthe cooperation agreement, which seeks to strengthen\r\nconsultations on all matters of common interest in the\r\npolitical, economic, social, scientific and cultural fields.\r\nWe hope that this cooperation will continue to\r\ndevelop, thus making it possible to define areas of\r\nspecific action where the ACTC can act in support of the\r\nUnited Nations, helping it to accomplish its often difficult\r\ntasks. This cooperation will contribute to promoting their\r\ncommon goal, which is to serve the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French): The\r\nitem we are considering today, Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation, is of prime importance to my\r\ndelegation.\r\nThe establishment of the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation (ACTC), on 20 March 1970 in\r\nNiamey was a milestone in the realization of the plan to\r\nbring together the countries using French as a common\r\nlanguage in a joint project, thus contributing to the\r\nexpression of solidarity by creating harmonious relations\r\nbetween peoples through a fruitful and ongoing dialogue\r\nbetween their cultures and civilizations.\r\nPresident Léopold Sédar Senghor, one of the first\r\nproponents of this ideal, was also one of the first Heads\r\nof State to fight for the establishment of a French-\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nspeaking community in a framework of cooperation and\r\nsolidarity, and open to all. According to President Senghor,\r\nthat approach would promote the advent of a universal,\r\npan-human civilization that would be nothing more than a\r\nmeeting-place for giving and for receiving.\r\nThe ACTC was created against that backdrop to serve\r\nas a suitable framework for meetings, dialogue and\r\nconvergence within the family of French-speaking\r\ncountries. Its goal was to lead ultimately to the\r\nestablishment of a structured community that would\r\nparticipate to varying degrees in various aspects of\r\ninternational activities. The Agency’s mandate, therefore, is\r\nto promote and develop among its members a\r\nmultidimensional cooperation in key areas such as\r\neducation, economic development, environmental\r\nconservation, good governance, conflict prevention and the\r\nstrengthening of the rule of law.\r\nWe need hardly stress that the objectives of the\r\nAgency are identical to those of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. This is the context for the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Agency, whose relationship must\r\nnecessarily be reflected in the day-to-day life of both\r\ninstitutions.\r\nIn its resolution 50/3 of 16 October 1995, the General\r\nAssembly noted the complementarity of the activities of the\r\nAgency and those of the United Nations and of the\r\nprogrammes of its specialized agencies. As part of the\r\nimplementation of that resolution, the two institutions set up\r\nmechanisms for cooperation — in place since 25 June\r\nlast — under a cooperation agreement aimed at\r\nstrengthening their relations on matters of common concern,\r\nparticularly in the political, economic, scientific and cultural\r\nfields. I am convinced that this agreement will enable the\r\nACTC and the United Nations to cooperate more closely in\r\norder better to respond to the aspirations of peoples and\r\nnations, for whom these two institutions were created.\r\nI therefore call on Member States to support draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.1, of which Senegal is a sponsor, and\r\nalso to support the joint efforts of the United Nations and\r\nthe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation to\r\nconsolidate, broaden and deepen their cooperation in the\r\ninterests of peace and of international solidarity.\r\nMr. Wan Chat Kwong (Mauritius) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): My delegation is very pleased to associate\r\nitself with the draft resolution introduced by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of France on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation (ACTC).\r\nMauritius, a founding member of the ACTC,\r\nwelcomes the important progress made to date in the\r\nrelations between the United Nations and the Agency, as\r\nevidenced in the information contained in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, for which my delegation is most\r\ngrateful.\r\nThe relationship between the United Nations and the\r\nAgency goes back to 1978, when the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolution 33/18. But it was in particular at the\r\nbeginning of this decade and more specifically after the\r\nopening of the liaison offices of the Agency at the United\r\nNations, first in Geneva in 1991 and then here in New\r\nYork in 1995, that this relationship gained new\r\nmomentum and greater significance.\r\nIt was, quite naturally, to the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization that the\r\nAgency turned in 1976, six years after its founding, to\r\nestablish its first contacts with one of the members of the\r\nfamily of the United Nations. That relationship was\r\nstrengthened by the signing in 1990 of an additional\r\nprotocol to the 1976 cooperation agreement. In the\r\nbeginning, the Agency strove to give clear priority to the\r\npromotion of education in the broadest sense of the word.\r\nLiteracy, technical training, vocational training and higher\r\neducation, and in particular higher technical education,\r\nwere the main concerns of most of the ministers and\r\nHeads of State of member States. Today, education and\r\ntraining remain priorities for the Agency. Cultural\r\nactivities also figured prominently at the 1970 conference,\r\nheld in Niamey, that established the Agency.\r\nMore recently, the Agency concluded cooperation\r\nframework agreements with other United Nations bodies,\r\nincluding the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization (UNIDO) in November 1990, and,\r\nparticularly following the adoption of resolution 50/3,\r\nwith the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\r\nThat series was supplemented in June by the signing of a\r\ncooperation agreement by the Secretaries-General of the\r\ntwo organizations with a view to strengthening and\r\nexpanding their relationship.\r\nTogether with UNDP and UNIDO, the Agency is\r\ncarrying out economic development programmes stressing\r\nthe promotion of micro- and small enterprises, an area in\r\nwhich the Agency has already acquired a certain amount\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nof expertise, particularly in the least developed countries.\r\nMy delegation would also like to stress the cooperation\r\nbetween UNIDO and the Agency in organizing activities to\r\npromote industrial cooperation in the Indian Ocean\r\ncountries to process products in the areas of fishing,\r\nlivestock and agriculture. Joint programmes have been\r\ncarried out with UNICEF that aim to benefit young girls\r\nand young women, particularly in the area of education and\r\nliteracy training. The Agency has also assisted UNICEF in\r\nimplementing programmes to promote and protect the rights\r\nof women and children.\r\nCooperation between the two organizations should in\r\nfuture probably focus on promoting the rule of law and\r\ngood governance an on the area of preventive diplomacy.\r\nThe Agency and the United Nations have for several years\r\nbeen cooperating in the implementation of joint\r\nprogrammes in the field of human rights. Joint efforts have\r\nbeen made, mainly with the Centre for Human Rights in\r\nGeneva and UNDP, to strengthen the rule of law and to\r\nlend support to the process of democratization and good\r\ngovernance. Contacts between the Agency and the Centre\r\nfor Human Rights will be developed further, as a new\r\ncooperation agreement was signed last month.\r\nThe Agency’s cooperation with the United Nations has\r\nnot been confined to carrying out activities in the field.\r\nThanks to its initiative and its material and logistical\r\nsupport, the countries that use French as a common\r\nlanguage have held a series of meetings and discussions in\r\nthe context of the major international conferences held\r\nduring the past decade under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. We believe that this dialogue among French-\r\nspeaking countries has made a significant contribution to\r\nthe success of those world conferences.\r\nHaving read the Secretary-General’s report, my\r\ndelegation is convinced that the adoption of this draft\r\nresolution will help not only to strengthen the already\r\nexemplary relationship between the United Nations and the\r\nAgency but also to expand and deepen these relations to the\r\nmutual benefit of both organizations and, ultimately, to that\r\nof the well-being of the international community as a\r\nwhole.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation, to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the\r\nAgency, Mr. Jean-Louis Roy, whose term of office will\r\ncome to an end next December, and to express to him our\r\ndeep gratitude for his outstanding contribution to bringing\r\nabout the rapprochement between the United Nations and\r\nthe Agency.\r\nMr. Diatta (Niger) (interpretation from French): As\r\nmembers know, the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation (ACTC) was founded in 1970 at Niamey, the\r\ncapital of my country, to foster multilateral cooperation\r\namong countries that use French as a common language,\r\nparticularly in the areas of education, culture, training and\r\neconomic development.\r\nLooking back over the Agency’s activities over the\r\npast 27 years, we can reaffirm that the ACTC has made\r\na major contribution to the achievement of one of the\r\npurposes of the United Nations: international cooperation\r\nin the solution of economic, social, intellectual and\r\nhumanitarian problems with a view to bringing peoples\r\ncloser together and to strengthen their solidarity.\r\nThe Agency’s effectiveness has been manifested,\r\ninter alia, in the considerable support it has provided to\r\ndeveloping countries members to develop their\r\neducational systems, protect their cultural heritage, protect\r\ntheir environment and develop their economic potential.\r\nIt is gratifying that an institution carrying out\r\nactivities that are so vital for improving the future of\r\nhuman communities established fruitful cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations at an early stage. The General\r\nAssembly granted it observer status in 1978, which\r\nenabled the Agency to become more involved in the\r\nactivities of the Organization and of its subsidiary bodies.\r\nBut it was the adoption of resolution 50/3 of 16 October\r\n1995, which noted the complementarity of the activities\r\nof the two organizations and laid the foundation for a new\r\npartnership.\r\nIn furtherance of the provisions of that resolution,\r\nthe Secretaries-General of the United Nations and of the\r\nACTC signed a cooperation agreement on 25 June 1997,\r\nby which the two organizations promised to cooperate in\r\nareas of common interest, to provide mutual assistance in\r\ncertain spheres, and to ensure effective liaison between\r\ntheir two secretariats; my delegation welcomes that\r\nagreement.\r\nMy delegation considers that the ACTC, through its\r\nmany activities, does indeed have much to contribute to\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations Secretariat to serve the\r\ninternational community better. The usefulness of the\r\nAgency in very specific areas was clearly reflected in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the item before us\r\ntoday, documents A/52/299 and A/52/299/Add.1 of 27\r\nAugust 1997 and 16 September 1997 respectively. In\r\nreading the report, we were pleased to note that\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\ninstitutions such as the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund and the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization are at present cooperating closely with the\r\nACTC, and that Secretariat structures such as the\r\nDepartment of Political Affairs, the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations and the Department for Economic\r\nand Social Affairs have expressed the wish to forge links\r\nof cooperation in various sectors.\r\nHere, my delegation welcomes the establishment of\r\ncooperation in the areas of democratization and the\r\nprevention of conflicts. In those areas the Agency has a\r\nwealth of experience to share. Niger and many other\r\nAfrican countries can bear witness to this, because most of\r\nthem are engaged in a process of democratization and have\r\nbenefitted from activities initiated by the Agency in the\r\nareas of assistance with and observation of elections,\r\nimproving the conditions in which justice is carried out, and\r\npromoting and protecting human rights.\r\nTurning to the maintenance of peace and the\r\nprevention of conflicts, the Agency has shown its value\r\nthrough its efforts to resolve crises in a number of\r\nFrancophone countries. Its contacts with the Organization\r\nof African Unity — which led in March 1990 to the signing\r\nof a framework agreement on cooperation — may be seen\r\nin the same light, as they involve coordinating the efforts\r\nof the two organizations to strengthen the capacity of\r\nAfrican countries to prevent conflicts and to maintain peace\r\non the continent.\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his excellent report on\r\nthis agenda item. The information in the report testifies to\r\nthe vitality of the relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the ACTC. The international community should\r\nencourage that relationship because it furthers the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations.\r\nBecause of all those considerations, my delegation has\r\njoined in sponsoring draft resolution A/52/L.1 of 15\r\nOctober 1997, which the representative of France has just\r\nintroduced. We are convinced that the draft resolution will\r\nenjoy the unanimous support of Member States.\r\nMr. Yacoubou (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nMy delegation is happy to join in sponsoring draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.1, on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation (ACTC).\r\nIt is nearly two years since the official opening in\r\nNew York, on 25 October 1995, of the Office of the\r\nPermanent Observer for the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation to the United Nations; and it has\r\nbeen two years since the General Assembly adopted\r\nwithout a vote, on 16 October 1995, resolution 50/3,\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation”.\r\nTwo years is rather a short time to venture on an\r\nassessment of the strengthened cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations, but I am gratified to note that in 1995\r\nthe two-decade relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the Agency entered a new phase marked by new\r\nagreements between the organizations. Let me give as\r\nexamples the framework cooperation agreement between\r\nthe ACTC and the United Nations Children’s Fund,\r\nsigned on 26 October 1995, and the framework\r\ncooperation agreement between the ACTC and the United\r\nNations Development Programme, signed on 2 October\r\n1996.\r\nFurthermore, consultations and dialogue have been\r\nconducted on a more regular basis between the\r\nSecretariats of the two bodies. I should like to mention\r\nhere the consultations held between senior officials of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat and those of the ACTC\r\nsecretariat. They centred, inter alia, on developments in\r\nCentral Africa and initiatives undertaken by various\r\nparties to try to bring about a peaceful settlement to the\r\ncrisis in the Great Lakes region; electoral assistance to\r\nFrench-speaking countries at their request; and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, in particular preparatory work for the\r\nnineteenth special session of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to the review and assessment of the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21.\r\nThese varied areas of discussion and cooperation\r\nattest to the vitality of the relationship and, above all, to\r\nthe real desire of the United Nations to work with the\r\nAgency of the French-speaking communities.\r\nIt is highly desirable for the two organizations, at the\r\nsame time as consolidating their work in fields in which\r\ncooperation has already begun, to expand the area of their\r\nrelationship to new sectors. The goal here is to provide a\r\nconcrete and effective contribution to improving the living\r\nand working conditions of the peoples of the Member\r\nStates.\r\nIn a few weeks my country, Benin, which has\r\nchaired the group of francophone countries since it hosted\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nthe sixth Summit Conference of countries that use French\r\nas a common language in December 1995 at Cotonou, will\r\npass the torch to Viet Nam. It is in Hanoi that our Heads of\r\nState and Government will be meeting for the seventh\r\nsummit of our organization. This will be a further\r\nopportunity to press ahead with strengthening our special\r\nrelationship and to initiate new joint action under the aegis\r\nof the United Nations and the ACTC.\r\nThus, the two organizations will be able to lay down\r\nnew milestones which will provide the foundations and\r\nmodels for the fruitful partnership the international\r\ncommunity desires.\r\nMoreover, the election in Hanoi of the first secretary-\r\ngeneral of the French-speaking organization will be a new\r\nturning point in the relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the ACTC, which within their respective mandates will\r\nhave to confront the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe are therefore confident about the future of the\r\ncooperation between our two institutions and the role that\r\nthey can play, individually and jointly to encourage peoples\r\nto work together in a spirit of solidarity and true\r\npartnership with the goal of complete eradication of\r\npoverty, which now represents the bad conscience of the\r\nhuman community and the commemoration of which today\r\nsymbolically coincides with this meeting.\r\nMr. Mpay (Cameroon) (interpretation from French):\r\nAs my delegation is speaking for the first time, allow me\r\nto extend our warmest congratulations to Mr. Udovenko on\r\nhis election to preside over the General Assembly. Our\r\ncongratulations also go to his predecessor, Ambassador\r\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia, for the skill with which he\r\nguided our work during the previous session.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the election of Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan to the post of Secretary-General of our Organization.\r\nCameroon supports his tireless efforts to adapt the United\r\nNations to the changes and upheavals in the world.\r\nThe relationship between the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation (ACTC) and the United Nations\r\ngoes back a number of years. In 1978, the General\r\nAssembly adopted its resolution 33/18 in which it granted\r\nthe Agency the status of observer. Since then, and under\r\nthe impetus of its Secretary-General, the Agency has carried\r\nout its activities in three main directions, including its\r\ngeneral mandate of consensus-building.\r\nIn its consensus-building activities, the Agency,\r\nwhile seeking to define a francophone identity, has also\r\ngiven expression to a set of shared values. Its basic\r\nmandate is to emphasize and develop multilateral\r\ncooperation among its members in areas such as\r\neducation and training, culture and communication,\r\nenergy, the environment, agriculture, and so on.\r\nAmong the other functions entrusted to it in its\r\ncharter, the Agency undertakes studies, information,\r\ncoordination and even action programmes. In that respect\r\nit is responsible inter alia, for helping Governments to\r\ngain full access to sources of bilateral and multilateral\r\ncooperation, and to try to maintain ties with international\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations\r\nworking in the fields where it is active. Given the\r\nnumerous development problems faced by the French-\r\nspeaking countries of the South and the modest means\r\nmade available by the actors in international cooperation,\r\nthe Agency has set itself the objectives, among others, of\r\nensuring that francophone countries obtain their due share\r\nof the investments of international organizations and of\r\nproviding them with substantial resources through joint\r\nfinancing.\r\nThere has therefore been fruitful cooperation\r\nbetween the Agency and the United Nations in the past\r\ntwo years. In this regard, an example is the signing of a\r\nframework agreement with the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF), in addition to the framework agreements\r\nconcluded with the United Nations and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO). One might also refer to the joint work\r\ncarried out with the United Nations Centre for Human\r\nRights and the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) with a view to mutually supporting peacekeeping\r\ninterventions and the holding of intersectoral meetings\r\nwith UNESCO in order to devise common approaches in\r\nthe areas of culture, communication and basic education.\r\nThe agreements I have referred to indicate that in the\r\npast few years the relationship between the Agency and\r\nthe organizations of the United Nations system have been\r\nstrengthened through several synergetic actions. With\r\nregard to links between UNESCO and the Agency in the\r\nfield of culture, to mention but one specific sector, these\r\ntwo organizations are collaborating closely in the\r\nimplementation of the International Fund for the\r\nPromotion of the Study of African Languages and\r\nCultures (FIDELCA) programme. In 1997 UNESCO also\r\ntook part in organizing the Market for African Art and\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nEntertainment (MASA) which the Agency launched in 1993\r\nin Abidjan.\r\nThe implementation of the ACTC/United Nations\r\nIndustrial Development Organization (UNIDO) framework\r\nagreement has led to the initiation of six joint programmes\r\nin 15 French-speaking countries to promote agriculture and\r\nindustry. These include: support for the establishment of\r\nunits for the production of agricultural equipment and tools\r\nin the countries covered by the Central African Customs\r\nand Economic Union; the promotion of industrial\r\ncooperation in the Indian Ocean countries for the processing\r\nof products of fisheries, animal husbandry and agriculture;\r\nand seminars and training sessions on non-polluting\r\nindustrial project design and the training of trainers in\r\nsetting up and financing small and medium-sized\r\nenterprises.\r\nIn cooperation with UNICEF, the Agency has\r\nintroduced a series of education and literacy programmes\r\nfor girls and young women in rural areas of Benin, Senegal,\r\nBurkina Faso, Mauritania, Viet Nam, Djibouti, Haiti, and\r\nother countries.\r\nSeveral projects are being carried out in\r\nimplementation of the agreement between the United\r\nNations Development Programme and the Agency for\r\nCultural and Technical Cooperation. These include a\r\nprogramme to support small and medium-sized enterprises\r\nin Laos within the framework of the United Nations Capital\r\nDevelopment Fund, and the establishment in Togo of a\r\nnetwork allowing for the collection, processing and\r\ndissemination on the Internet of information relating to\r\nsustainable development. In partnership with the Office of\r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Agency has\r\nheld several seminars on various aspects of human rights\r\nissues. Furthermore, consultation and dialogue between the\r\nsecretariats of these two institutions have increased. The\r\nmost recent of these discussions relate to current issues,\r\nincluding the development of the political situation in\r\nCentral Africa and the initiatives undertaken to achieve a\r\npeaceful settlement of the crisis in that region; electoral\r\nassistance to francophone countries; and sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the implementation of Agenda 21.\r\nIn this light, we are right to welcome the\r\ncomplementary activities between the United Nations and\r\nthe Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation. In\r\nprinciple we could not do otherwise, because these two\r\norganizations are working for the well-being of humankind.\r\nTherefore, let us hope that their various forms of\r\ncooperation will be further strengthened.\r\nThat is why my delegation has become a sponsor of\r\ndraft resolution A/52/L.1, and, like other delegations, we\r\nhope that the draft resolution will be adopted by\r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Ould Deddach (Mauritania) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): As this is the first time that I have spoken\r\nto the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, I\r\nshould like to express my satisfaction at seeing\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko presiding over our work. Given\r\nhis experience and personal qualities, we are sure that,\r\nunder his guidance, we will achieve positive results.\r\nThe institutionalization of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation, which was enshrined in resolution\r\n50/3 of 16 October 1995 during the fiftieth-anniversary\r\nsession of the United Nations, thus emerging just as our\r\nuniversal Organization reached maturity, needs to be\r\nstrengthened today even as the United Nations is making\r\na great effort to adapt to the needs of a world in the midst\r\nof change.\r\nIndeed, increased cooperation between the two\r\norganizations will, we hope, make it possible to establish\r\nthe foundations for international cooperation that is free\r\nfrom ideological confrontation and resolutely determined\r\nto meet its global challenges: economic and social\r\ndevelopment; strengthening democracy and respect for\r\nhuman rights; the promotion of sustainable development\r\nwhile taking account of the need for environmental\r\nconservation; the struggle against the scourge of drugs;\r\nand the promotion of gender equality.\r\nIt is fortunate that in all these areas the activities of\r\nthe United Nations have been backed up by the Agency\r\nfor Cultural and Technical Cooperation, which is pursuing\r\nthe same goals and defending the same ideal of peace,\r\ncooperation and understanding among peoples.\r\nThe Agency was created on 20 March 1970 on the\r\nbasis of a common plan for all countries that use French\r\nas a common language, with the aim of giving expression\r\nto a new solidarity and an additional factor for bringing\r\npeople closer together through an ongoing dialogue\r\nbetween civilizations. The Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation has for many years pursued its\r\nactivities while fully respecting the specific identities of\r\neach of its members and participating constructively in\r\nglobal dialogue.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nFrom Rio in 1992 to New York in 1997, via Beijing\r\nand other venues, it has participated actively in discussions\r\nleading to the adoption of various programmes of action,\r\njust as it has supported the participation of its members in\r\nthese meetings. Heads of State of countries using French as\r\na common language, grouped together in this French-\r\nspeaking community, decided to establish a new partnership\r\nwith all the agencies that are members of the United\r\nNations family, thereby stressing the complementarity that\r\nexists between the United Nations and francophone\r\nmovement. In so doing, they gave specific expression to\r\nChapters VIII and IX of the United Nations Charter, which\r\nencourage close cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations with the object of creating the\r\nnecessary conditions of stability and well-being so as to\r\nensure stable, friendly relations among nations conducive to\r\nmaintaining peace and security.\r\nIn this respect, the Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation plays a very positive role for the francophone\r\ncommunity by promoting multilateral cooperation between\r\nits members in areas of common interest for the United\r\nNations, such as the right to development and democracy,\r\neducation and training and technical cooperation in vital\r\nareas such as energy, scientific information and the\r\nenvironment. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania, which\r\nhas always based its policies on dialogue and friendly\r\ndiscussion, can only be delighted to be associated with an\r\ninitiative that encourages understanding among nations and\r\npeoples.\r\nMauritania is both an Arab and an African country\r\nwith a diverse cultural heritage, and my country considers\r\nits vocation to be active participation within an organization\r\nthat, while respecting cultural diversity, advocates a fruitful\r\ndialogue for the benefit of all its members for the\r\npreservation of peace and stability.\r\nThat is why we are happy to co-sponsor draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.1, which is before the Assembly, and we\r\nhope that it will be adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Ravou-Akii (Vanuatu) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): On behalf of my delegation, I should like to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his report entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Agency for Cultural\r\nand Technical Cooperation”, contained in document\r\nA/52/299 of 27 August 1997 and its addendum 1 of 16\r\nSeptember 1997, now being considered under agenda item\r\n22 of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session.\r\nThe activities of the Agency for Cultural and\r\nTechnical Cooperation (ACTC) can be clearly seen in the\r\nfield within the territory of the Republic of Vanuatu in\r\nthree areas: first, in the area of renewable energy sources;\r\nsecondly, in training art and primary level teachers; and\r\nlastly in the training of magistrates.\r\nLet us first consider the area of renewable energy\r\nsources. The Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation, with the vigorous participation of countries\r\nusing French as a common language, is at present\r\nimplementing a vast solar-energy electrification\r\nprogramme for elementary schools in Vanuatu. Some\r\nelements of that programme are being carried out in the\r\nfield in accordance with paragraph 14 of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s aforementioned report. These are joint activities\r\nbetween the ACTC and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme.\r\nPrimary school teachers in the French language\r\nreceive training at the Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau in\r\nHanoi.\r\nFinally, French-speaking magistrates in the Republic\r\nof Vanuatu at present receive training outside the\r\nRepublic. The Government looks forward to the setting\r\nup, in agreement with the Agency, of training structures\r\nfor such magistrates within the existing legal training\r\nsystem of the South Pacific University, whose\r\nheadquarters are in Vanuatu.\r\nThe Republic of Vanuatu supports cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Agency for Cultural\r\nand Technical Cooperation, and is pleased to be among\r\nthe sponsors of draft resolution A/52/L.1, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the Agency\r\nfor Cultural and Technical Cooperation”, introduced by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of the French Republic. We\r\nhope that the Assembly will adopt it unanimously.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 33/18 of 10 November 1978, I now\r\ncall on Mr. Jean Louis Roy, Secretary-General of the\r\nAgency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation.\r\nMr. Roy (Agency for Cultural and Technical\r\nCooperation) (interpretation from French): The objectives\r\nof peace, security and development pursued by the United\r\nNations are at the very basis of the francophone project\r\ndescribed by the founders of the intergovernmental\r\nfrancophone organization in Niamey in 1970. In its 27\r\nyears of existence since then, it has become a real\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\ndynamo of progress based on common values, notably those\r\nof democracy and the rule of law. It brings together a\r\ncommunity of more than 400 million persons in Europe,\r\nAfrica, America and Asia.\r\nOur community is diverse spiritually, culturally and\r\nlinguistically. But it has progressively defined the\r\ncomponents of its unity, which are the rule of law in\r\nconditions of sustainable development. The two are\r\ninseparable.\r\nMany times during the biennial conferences held since\r\n1986 the Heads of State and Government of countries that\r\nuse French as a common language — one country out of\r\nfour in the world — have recognized the role of\r\nmultilateralism in the new international context and\r\nconfirmed their will to help find a solution to global\r\npolitical and economic problems. They had hoped for this\r\nnew partnership, based on concrete objectives, with all the\r\nmembers of the United Nations system, this new\r\npartnership that brings us together today.\r\nIt was in this spirit that at the fiftieth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly the countries of the French-speaking\r\ncommunity within the United Nations — several of which\r\nhave spoken in this debate — took the initiative of seeking\r\nto include a new item on the agenda, which resulted in a\r\nresolution calling on our two Organizations, the United\r\nNations and the Agency, to explore means of closer\r\ncooperation to allow a pooling of their human, technical\r\nand financial resources for the benefit of the peace and\r\ndevelopment of the international community in general and\r\nof the French-speaking community, in particular. The\r\nresolution noted the achievements of the two Organizations\r\nand sought to show the way ahead.\r\nAs several speakers have noted, we have for long, as\r\nmandated, been drawing closer to the United Nations,\r\nparticularly during the long, important sequence of\r\ninternational gatherings, which has guided us all, from the\r\nWorld Summit for Children, held in this Hall, to the Rio +\r\n5 Conference, which also took place here a few weeks ago;\r\nby way of Rio again; Vienna — the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights; Barbados — the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates; Tokyo — the International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment; Cairo — the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development; Copenhagen — the World\r\nSummit for Social Development; Rome — the World Food\r\nSummit, 1996; and, finally, Rome again — the First\r\nConference of the Parties to the International Convention to\r\nCombat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing\r\nSerious Drought and/or Desertification, particularly in\r\nAfrica, which has just taken place. At each of these\r\nconferences the Agency and its francophone partners have\r\nclosely followed the United Nations lead and enriched its\r\nefforts. We have sought to ensure that all the French-\r\nspeaking countries take part in every stage in the\r\npreparation, holding and follow-up of these world\r\nconferences.\r\nIn addition to being involved in these conferences,\r\nwe have long sought to bring out specific synergies with\r\nthe United Nations system on the ground. Francophone\r\ncooperation is marked by a strong desire for specific,\r\nuseful and visible action. We are pleased that many\r\ncountries have mentioned this in referring to a number of\r\nour Agency’s programmes and their deployment in their\r\ncountries and regions.\r\nFor us, cooperation is like an investment. We need\r\nto see a return from our investments somewhere. We have\r\ntherefore established with the United Nations system, in\r\nall cases with specific objectives, synergies on the ground.\r\nAs many speakers have recalled we worked first with the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) in the area of education,\r\ncentring our joint activities around basic education,\r\ndistance learning and new information technology — in\r\nbrief, it is clear, around the main areas of culture, seeking\r\nto align culture and economy, as was the case in 1993,\r\n1995 and 1997, with the three Markets for African Art\r\nand Entertainment.\r\nSimilar thinking applied in our relations with the\r\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\r\n(UNIDO), with which a framework agreement was signed\r\nin 1990. As several speakers have recalled, it sought to\r\nstrengthen cooperation between developing countries; to\r\norganize solid training in the matter of industrial\r\nmanagement, maintenance and research; and to support\r\nthe creation and management of enterprises, feasibility\r\nstudies and the promotion of investment. This is major\r\nwork, in particular in the area of technology linked to\r\ncommunications and in other areas that the report of the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations covers.\r\nThese are the fruits of the cooperation between the\r\ntwo Organizations before 1995, when the resolution that\r\neveryone has mentioned, resolution 50/3, was adopted.\r\nSince then, in the spirit mentioned earlier, particularly by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of France, we have pooled\r\nconsiderable resources with those of the United Nations\r\nover the last two years. In June this year Mr. Kofi Annan\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nand I signed an agreement on strengthening cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the ACTC. The agreement\r\ntook note of many agreements with bodies in the United\r\nNations family, bringing together agreements signed with\r\nMrs. Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, in October 1995 and October\r\n1996 and with Mr. Speth, Administrator of the United\r\nNations Development Programme, in October 1996. In\r\nevery case, the agreements were designed to pool the\r\nresources of the two Organizations for specific activities in\r\na particular country or region, or in many countries. In\r\nGeneva recently I also had the honour to sign an important\r\nagreement with the Administrator in Charge of the Office\r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which\r\nprovides for joint action to strengthen the rule of law,\r\npromote and protect human rights, strengthen democracy\r\nand so forth.\r\nOn our initiative, on 29 September there was a\r\nmeeting at our headquarters in Paris of United Nations\r\nofficials who deal with electoral assistance, peacekeeping\r\nand the consolidation of peace and support for the rule of\r\nlaw. The joint activities we have already carried out\r\nconvince me that that meeting will pave the way to a new\r\nand higher level of cooperation in these most fundamental\r\nareas.\r\nThe draft resolution before the Assembly, while noting\r\nwith satisfaction the encouraging progress in cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Agency, includes many\r\nimportant areas of cooperation we can explore in the future.\r\nIt also illustrates — as needs to be done from time to\r\ntime — the fruitfulness of multilateralism in world affairs.\r\nI hope that the momentum generated by resolution 50/3 can\r\nbe maintained, consolidated and increased. Our Heads of\r\nState and Government have expressed this hope on several\r\noccasions, as have many delegations that have made\r\nstatements and sponsored the draft resolution.\r\nI hope that the francophone delegations and the\r\ndelegations from other regions that have been good enough\r\nto hear what we have had to say about cooperation between\r\nfrancophonie and the United Nations will accept my\r\ngratitude for the kind words expressed this morning on the\r\nAgency’s work and achievements, and for their active\r\nsupport for strengthening cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Agency for the French-Speaking\r\nCommunity. I feel certain that the cooperation between the\r\ntwo Organizations will be reinforced by the work and\r\ndecisions of the Seventh Summit of the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of countries that are linked by their common\r\nusage of the French language, which will be held in\r\nHanoi from 14 to 16 November.\r\nI reserve my warmest thanks for the men and\r\nwomen in the United Nations system who have given\r\nmeaning, direction and substance to the bond proclaimed\r\nin General Assembly resolution 50/3, which called on the\r\nUnited Nations and the ACTC to pool their resources to\r\nconsolidate conditions in which we may have peace for\r\ndevelopment and to meet the universal need to live\r\ntogether, equal but different.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now take\r\na decision on draft resolution A/52/L.1.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Perfiliev (Director, General Assembly and\r\nEconomic and Social Council Affairs Division)\r\n(interpretation from French): Should the General\r\nAssembly adopt draft resolution A/52/L.1, there will be\r\nno programme budget implications.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the\r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/52/L.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.1 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/2).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 22?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 46 (continued)\r\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/305)\r\nMr. Samhan (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): It gives me pleasure, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the United Arab Emirates, to join preceding\r\nspeakers in expressing thanks and appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development. The valuable information it contains\r\nwill serve us well in our deliberations. I would also like\r\nto express our support for the statement made by the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nrepresentative of the United Republic of Tanzania on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China on this item.\r\nOur review of the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit\r\ngives expression to the will of the international community\r\nto deal with social phenomena and the radical changes in\r\nthe international environment, with their social and\r\neconomic ramifications affecting all societies.\r\nHeads of State and Government have welcomed the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration on Social Development and\r\nProgramme of Action and expressed the importance of\r\nachieving the goals of sustainable development and the\r\nwelfare of the individual. They have also reviewed various\r\nfactors relevant to this question. Nevertheless, a feeling of\r\nconcern and anxiety continues to cast its shadow on the\r\nworld environment as a result of the growing social and\r\ndevelopmental challenges and the widening economic and\r\nsocial gaps between the developed and the developing\r\ncountries. This has contributed greatly to widespread\r\npoverty, illiteracy and unemployment.\r\nSome statistics have recently indicated that across the\r\nworld 1.2 billion people live below the poverty line, lacking\r\nthe most basic necessities such as food, drinking-water,\r\nhealth and education services, and so on.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates declares its support for the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, as a\r\nnew mechanism for increasing international and national\r\nawareness of social problems, one which will promote a\r\njoint approach to containing the growing challenges.\r\nAt the same time, my country reaffirms the pressing\r\nimportance of the promotion of wide-ranging global and\r\nregional cooperation, based on shared perceptions within a\r\nbroad framework, in order to address social, economic and\r\ndevelopmental problems and to ensure the protection of\r\nhuman rights and other basic freedoms.\r\nThe linkage between various styles of social\r\ndevelopment and the growth of regional and local armed\r\nconflicts, illegal drug trafficking, and organized crime and\r\nviolence has increased the difficulty of solving social\r\nproblems. These challenges have indeed crossed national\r\nboundaries to become global issues, and Governments are\r\nless able than ever to deal with them alone, without\r\ncooperation and mutual coordination, whether on the\r\nbilateral, regional or international level. Therefore, we\r\nreiterate that the support and continued collective\r\ncommitment of the international community is an urgent\r\nnecessity.\r\nThere is an equally urgent need for promoting joint\r\nefforts to achieve development and to deal with the\r\ncontinued decrease of official development assistance\r\nprovided by donor countries to the developing world. All\r\nof these factors continue to hamper the implementation of\r\nvarious strategies and programmes aimed at effecting\r\ndevelopmental and social reforms.\r\nIn this context, the United Arab Emirates considers\r\nthat family-related concerns — the well-being of women,\r\nchildren, the elderly and the disabled — and health and\r\neducation services are issues of growing importance\r\nresulting from continuing challenges in the field of\r\ndevelopment in many regions, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping countries. We therefore call for concerted\r\nglobal efforts to create an international environment\r\ncharacterized by equity and justice, in order to achieve\r\nhumanity’s aspirations for peace, security, stability and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt the same time we support the recommendations\r\nadopted by the Commission for Social Development,\r\nwhich are aimed at increasing productive employment,\r\nreducing unemployment, and improving social services\r\nfor all sectors of society without exception and on the\r\nbasis of sustainability and justice.\r\nIt is our hope that every effort will be made to\r\nensure the success of the special session of the General\r\nAssembly to review and assess the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nto be held in the year 2000.\r\nIn this regard, we would like to reaffirm anew the\r\nimportance of strengthening the role of the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies and other\r\ninternational development organizations in order to play\r\na more effective part, especially in the social, economic\r\nand development fields.\r\nOn the instructions of His Highness Sheikh Zayed\r\nibn Sultan Al Nuhayyan, Head of State of the United\r\nArab Emirates, my country has pursued development\r\npolicies and measures which are consonant with\r\ninternational and national variables, and which are\r\nharmonious with our beliefs, our heritage and our\r\ntraditions, emanating from the tolerant Islamic shariah.\r\nAs part of its commitment to the implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the Copenhagen Summit, the United Arab\r\nEmirates has developed new legislation and changed some\r\nof its systems for social and economic development, in\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\norder to implement ambitious development programmes\r\naimed at the development of human resources, as well as\r\neducation, health, cultural and training programmes. It has\r\nallocated the necessary financial and psychological support\r\nresources to provide training programmes for the\r\nrehabilitation of the elderly and the disabled, in order to\r\nensure their integration into the society and their effective\r\nparticipation in development programmes.\r\nWe also concentrate on development of the\r\nparticipation of the private sector in the training of local\r\nhuman resources and the implementation of national\r\npolicies and programmes for socio-economic development.\r\nMy country provides employment opportunities for all its\r\ncitizens, men and women alike, in order to raise the\r\nstandard of living of the citizens and to adopt a new\r\nscientific approach for managing their daily life.\r\nAs an expression of its conviction of the need for\r\nlinking economic objectives to the goals of comprehensive\r\nsocial development with its human and civilizational\r\ndimensions, our country continues to develop rural areas\r\nand link them to cities through the modernization of a vast\r\nnetwork of roads. This is in addition to the provision of\r\nelectricity, drinking-water and acceptable housing in all\r\nparts of the country. We continue to develop social care\r\nprogrammes in order to achieve a qualitative leap in the\r\nstandard of living for various sectors of our society and to\r\npromote and consolidate the concepts of social and family\r\nintegration.\r\nWe do not confine ourselves to the local level alone;\r\nrather, our efforts extend to cooperation with regional,\r\nbilateral and international development programmes. My\r\ncountry has participated in the implementation and\r\nfinancing of some social projects in several developing\r\ncountries. It has given soft loans to other developing\r\ncountries, to enable them to meet the basic needs of their\r\ncitizens in the field of social services.\r\nWe have participated in cooperative social and\r\ndevelopmental endeavours by hosting many conferences,\r\nseminars and training programmes on social issues, the\r\nenvironment, population and other development-related\r\nmatters. We look forward to participating in the World\r\nConference of Ministers Responsible for Youth to be held\r\nin Lisbon next August.\r\nFinally, my delegation hopes that the efforts of the\r\ninternational community will rise to meet the challenge, in\r\norder to achieve the comprehensive objectives contained in\r\nthe Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Work.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): The past decade has\r\nbeen marked by a number of important global\r\nconferences, among which the 1995 Copenhagen World\r\nSummit for Social Development was of special\r\nimportance. Much has happened since then, but we have\r\ngood reasons for stating that the follow-up to it has not\r\nmet our expectations.\r\nThat is why our delegation is very hopeful that the\r\nspecial session of the United Nations General Assembly\r\nin the year 2000, which will undertake an overall review\r\nand appraisal of the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit, will be the main test in evaluating\r\nthe capacity of the community of nations to respond\r\nproperly and adequately to the major social challenges of\r\nthe present day and to fulfil its Charter commitments.\r\nIn preparing for the special session the Governments\r\nof Member States should demonstrate their political will\r\nin practical terms by intensifying their efforts to eliminate\r\npoverty in general, eradicate absolute poverty, increase\r\nemployment and decrease unemployment and by\r\ndeepening social integration in their respective countries.\r\nIn a letter addressed to the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral in March 1996, the President of Ukraine outlined\r\nthe measures undertaken by our country at the national\r\nlevel to implement the decisions of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit. Subsequently, the Presidential decree on the\r\nmain tendencies of the activities of the State executive\r\npower of Ukraine in the implementation of the final\r\ndocuments of the World Summit for Social Development”\r\nwas promulgated. The recent establishment within the\r\nGovernment of Ukraine of the post of Vice-Prime\r\nMinister for Labour and Social Policy, the creation of a\r\nMinistry on Family and Youth and the adoption of a\r\nrange of programme documents are further evidence of\r\nthe consistency of Ukraine’s social policy and its\r\ninternational commitments.\r\nThe Government of Ukraine continues to focus its\r\nefforts on the problems of youth and the elderly, as well\r\nas on measures for the follow-up to the International Year\r\nof the Family, the International Year for the Eradication\r\nof Poverty and on preparations for the International Year\r\nof Older Persons in 1999. In the context of the\r\nInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty, the\r\nUkrainian Government has established a system to\r\nmonitor poverty and to collect and review data and\r\ninformation relating to its root causes and the different\r\nforms it takes.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nToday, 17 October, we are commemorating the\r\nInternational Day for the Eradication of Poverty. According\r\nto statistical reports, more than 1.3 billion people are now\r\nliving on less than $1 a day, and 2 billion more are only\r\nmarginally better off. This is a disturbing situation which\r\nthe United Nations should take very seriously. As we may\r\nrecall, the participants in the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment committed themselves to the goal of\r\neradicating poverty as an ethical, social, political and\r\neconomic imperative of humankind. In this regard, we\r\nsupport the activity of the newly established Department for\r\nEconomic and Social Affairs aimed at assisting in the\r\nimplementation of the follow-up to the Summit. Our\r\ndelegation would also like to welcome the joint efforts of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Population\r\nFund and other interested bodies in supporting national anti-\r\npoverty strategies.\r\nToday the United Nations is undergoing a complicated\r\nprocess of reform. The time has come for the Organization\r\nto change and to be more responsive to the new challenges\r\nof the permanently changing world. In our view,\r\nnotwithstanding certain shortcomings, the proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General to reorganize the United Nations\r\nstructure and programme activities, particularly in the social\r\nand economic fields, deserve our full support. We are\r\nconfident that the United Nations should not only continue\r\nto focus on strengthening international cooperation in the\r\nfield of social and economic development, but that it should\r\nbe the leader in such activities.\r\nMy delegation also notes with satisfaction the\r\nrevitalization of the activities of the United Nations\r\nCommission for Social Development, which has been\r\nentrusted with the basic responsibility for exercising control\r\nover the implementation of the decisions of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit.\r\nThe work of the last session of the Commission in the\r\nnew format has produced quite positive results, among them\r\nthe adoption of a number of constructive and balanced\r\nresolutions on such important issues as productive\r\nemployment, the International Year of Older Persons,\r\nmeasures for the follow-up to the International Year of the\r\nFamily and so on. We encourage the United Nations\r\nSecretariat to continue with measures to promote further\r\ndevelopment of the new forms of the Commission’s\r\nactivities.\r\nFinally, I am authorized to state here that Ukraine\r\nreaffirms its full commitment to the obligations undertaken\r\nat the World Summit for Social Development. Our\r\ncountry stands ready to contribute actively and\r\nconstructively to the preparation of the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly for an overall review and appraisal\r\nof the implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): During the\r\npreparatory process for the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, the Philippines played host to the Fourth\r\nAsian and Pacific Ministerial Conference on Social\r\nDevelopment of the Economic and Social Commission for\r\nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which resulted in the\r\nManila Declaration that called for the eradication of\r\npoverty by the year 2010.\r\nFrom 5 to 11 November of this year the Philippines\r\nwill once again serve as host to the Fifth Asian and\r\nPacific Ministerial Conference on Social Development of\r\nESCAP to review the national progress achieved and\r\nregional action taken in the implementation of the Agenda\r\nfor Action for Social Development in the ESCAP region\r\nwithin the context of the Programme of Action of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development.\r\nLast year, 18 economic leaders of members of the\r\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)\r\ngathered in the Philippines for the Fourth APEC summit,\r\nwhere they agreed to enhance economic-cooperation\r\ninitiatives in the Pacific region. The APEC leaders’\r\nDeclaration of Subic included such social-development\r\nissues as human-resource development, women and youth\r\nas part of APEC’s concerns.\r\nOn the subject of youth, the Philippines welcomes\r\nPortugal’s initiative to host the first World Conference of\r\nMinisters for Youth in August 1998 at Lisbon, and we\r\nbelieve that that will be an opportune time to assess the\r\nprogramme of action for youth and to set directions for\r\nthe future.\r\nConsistent with its international commitments, the\r\nPhilippines, under the leadership of President Fidel V.\r\nRamos, has intensified implementation of the Social\r\nReform Agenda (SRA), the blueprint of Philippine social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Philippine SRA, which was formulated in 1994,\r\nwas effectively expanded to improve the lives of ordinary\r\npeople and ensure that they achieve a quality of life that\r\ngives them dignity, hope and the power of choice. It\r\nprovides concrete, cross-sectoral, time-bound strategies to\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\neradicate poverty, focusing on three major agendas, namely,\r\naccess to quality basic services, access to productive\r\nresources and asset reforms and institution building and\r\nparticipation in governance.\r\nWith full employment as our goal, the Philippines has\r\nembarked upon a comprehensive employment-strategy\r\nprogramme to provide more jobs and livelihood\r\nopportunities, promote the rights and welfare of the labour\r\nsector and enhance human-resource development with new\r\napproaches to developing a competitive work force prepared\r\nto meet the challenges of globalization.\r\nThe Philippines has carefully studied the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, for which we thank him, on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development (A/52/305) and the report on the first\r\nUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty\r\n(A/52/315).\r\nIt is evident from the Secretary-General’s reports that\r\nmany countries have made serious efforts in implementing\r\nthe outcome of the Social Summit. We should encourage\r\nthe process of informing the international community of the\r\nactivities pursued by individual countries to implement the\r\noutcome of the Summit so that we can share and learn from\r\neach others’ experiences. In this regard, the Commission for\r\nSocial Development should develop an appropriate\r\nreporting format that would ensure a better appreciation of\r\ncountry activities implementing the specific results of the\r\nSummit. It would not be enough to simply summarize\r\npertinent national activities. These activities could be\r\nclustered in accordance with the specific recommendations\r\nof the Summit.\r\nIn a similar vein, we expect organized and coherent\r\ndata on the specific implementations of the Summit relative\r\nto the role of the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations and agencies, the non-governmental\r\norganizations and the donor community.\r\nThe question of resources is of course a central\r\nconcern in the implementation of the outcome. Unless\r\ncountries have the required resources, the outcome of the\r\nSocial Summit will remain a distant blueprint for action. It\r\nis of course the principal responsibility of countries\r\nthemselves to provide the resources for their social\r\ndevelopment, and the developing countries have done their\r\nbest, given the various economic and structural constraints\r\nconfronting them.\r\nThe Social Summit emphasized the role of\r\npartnership with other development actors, including the\r\ndonor community, in forging collaborative approaches to\r\npromoting social progress and development. It is in this\r\nregard that there were some expectations for official\r\ndevelopment assistance to increase. Instead, the reverse\r\nhas occurred. The level of official development assistance\r\nhas continuously declined over the past five years. It must\r\nbe realized that official development assistance is an\r\nessential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global\r\npartnership to address priority global social concerns such\r\nas poverty eradication, not to mention that such a source\r\nof external finance is critical to many capital-starved\r\ncountries, and also to the least developed countries.\r\nIn his report to the 1997 substantive session of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in document A/52/203, the\r\nSecretary-General made reference to innovative ideas for\r\ngenerating funds for globally agreed commitments and\r\npriorities. That report had a number of thought-provoking\r\nproposals on public-private partnerships in mobilizing\r\nfinance for achieving development objectives. My\r\ndelegation believes that the subject should be revisited by\r\nthe Economic and Social Council, as it did not have\r\nsufficient time then to consider the matter.\r\nMy delegation also believes that the Commission for\r\nSocial Development itself must look into the various\r\npossibilities of generating or mobilizing resources for\r\nactivities in response to the Social Summit. Although we\r\nagree, for instance, on the focus of the next session of the\r\nCommission for Social Development on such topics as\r\npromoting social integration, enhancing social protection,\r\nviolence, crime and the problem of illicit drugs, it may\r\nhave a better perspective on the financing requirements\r\nfor specific activities in response to the Social Summit\r\noutcome and where to find such financial resources.\r\nMy delegation is glad to note that early preparations\r\nare now being planned for the special session in the year\r\n2000 for an overall review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Social Summit. We\r\nsupport the recommendation that the preparatory\r\ncommittee of the whole of the General Assembly be\r\nestablished during the current session of the Assembly\r\nand that an organizational session of that committee be\r\nheld as early as possible in 1998.\r\nIn order to ensure a very successful review and\r\nappraisal of the outcome of the Social Summit in the year\r\n2000, it would be essential to commence the substantive\r\npreparations as soon as possible. It would also be\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nnecessary to arrange various activities beyond those\r\nmentioned in document A/52/305 and involving the\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations, academic\r\nand research organizations, business communities and other\r\nmembers of civil society that will support the process\r\nleading to the convening of the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the year 2000.\r\nWhile we applaud the notable gains achieved thus far\r\nsince the Copenhagen Summit, we cannot overemphasize\r\nthe enormity of the task still before us. The international\r\ncommunity must prove equal to the challenge. It must be\r\nable to demonstrate the required political will and provide\r\nthe necessary resources for the full implementation of the\r\noutcome of the Summit.\r\nMs. Camerano (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Colombia fully agrees with the decision by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the General Assembly to\r\nhave the Commission for Social Development carry out the\r\nfollow-up to the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit. We congratulate the Economic and\r\nSocial Council for the seriousness with which it has\r\nfulfilled that decision, as can be seen in the multi-year work\r\nprogramme, the opening of its discussions to experts on\r\nrelevant issues and the emphasis placed on drafting\r\npractical measures to achieve the implementation of the\r\nSummit’s recommendations.\r\nThe Economic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean sponsored the First Regional Conference in\r\nFollow-up to the World Summit for Social Development in\r\nApril 1997, in accordance with resolution 51/202. Colombia\r\nparticipated in that Conference and contributed to the\r\ndrafting of the São Paulo Consensus.\r\nIn assessing Colombia’s achievements in connection\r\nwith the basic themes of the Summit, we find that the\r\nsocial policies known as the “social leap” promoted by the\r\nGovernment of President Ernesto Samper coincide with the\r\ntenets and endorse the goals of the Copenhagen Declaration\r\nin its establishment of policies and programmes to eradicate\r\nglobal poverty.\r\nWe have established as a fundamental element of our\r\nsocial policy a “Network for Social Solidarity”. This was\r\nconceived as an instrument to improve the quality of life of\r\nthe most vulnerable sectors of Colombian society. Social\r\nspending between 1994 and 1998 rose to 41.8 per cent of\r\nthe total, as compared to 36.9 per cent in the previous four-\r\nyear period. Major budget resources are earmarked for\r\nbasic education, the health-care system and programmes\r\nunder the Network for Solidarity, among which stand out\r\nthose related to recreation and well-being, as well as\r\nnational strategies for the development of indigenous and\r\nAfro-Colombian peoples, which involve programmes for\r\nthe social integration of these ethnic groups that link them\r\nto national social and economic development projects.\r\nColombia endorses the view that we should stimulate\r\nnational initiatives for social development through credits\r\nfor persons living in poverty and the provision of low-\r\ncost housing.\r\nThe eradication of absolute poverty as a goal of the\r\nColombian Development Plan is a prime objective of the\r\npolicies and actions of the Government. This is why\r\nColombia welcomes the appeals by the General Assembly\r\nto unite national efforts and international cooperation in\r\norder to resolve this problem.\r\nColombia believes the international community’s\r\nfinancial initiatives and activities to provide assistance for\r\nsocial development — including the programmes of the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF) — are of great importance, as is the appeal to\r\ndeveloped countries to earmark 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\nnational product for official development assistance.\r\nSimilarly, we insist that the international community\r\nshould be committed to carry out the 20/20 programme\r\nfor the development of basic social programmes. The\r\nfreeing up of resources devoted to military purposes is an\r\nadditional source of financing for development.\r\nMultilateral debt is a serious burden that encumbers\r\nthe economies of a great number of poor countries,\r\nhampering their economic development and leaving them\r\nwithout sufficient capital for social and human\r\ndevelopment. The IMF and the World Bank have made\r\nan important advance in recognizing that the poorest and\r\nmost-indebted countries find it difficult to meet their\r\ncommitments, in particular their multilateral\r\ncommitments. But in so doing these institutions have\r\nrecognized, out of 41 extremely indebted countries, only\r\neight countries as having unsustainable debts and 12 as\r\nseriously indebted.\r\nWithout a doubt, as a part of development financing,\r\nexternal debt will continue to be one of the main\r\nproblems of global finance, economics and politics. But\r\nthe way we deal with this problem can improve if we\r\npursue the changes that are already taking place or could\r\ntake place in the political decisions of the creditor and\r\ndebtor countries.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nTo finance social infrastructure in the areas of\r\neducation and preventive and curative medicine, the\r\ndeveloping countries receive financing from only the World\r\nBank, the International Development Association and\r\ninternal savings. Foreign capital, whether through external\r\ncredit or foreign investment, is not providing financing for\r\nsocial projects. Regarding social-sector financing for the\r\ndeveloping countries, Colombia agrees with the views\r\nexpressed recently in the Second Committee by a professor\r\nat the University of Toronto, Gerald Helleiner. He\r\nrecommends that World Bank credits for social\r\ninfrastructure in the areas of education and preventive and\r\ncurative medicine should finance more than 50 per cent of\r\nthe costs of projects, and that the World Bank should\r\nincrease cooperation in the training of experts in the\r\npreparation and implementation of social programmes.\r\nIn fact, when dealing with extremely poor populations,\r\nColombia has changed its co-financing rates, requesting\r\nonly 5 per cent investment, the remaining 95 per cent\r\ncoming from loans from State institutions established for\r\nthis purpose.\r\nIt is important to increase the level of internal control\r\nover the fiscal management of projects. This is necessary so\r\nthat reports on what has been achieved can provide not only\r\na quantification of the financial investment but also real\r\ninformation as to the projects physically carried out, their\r\nquality and the population that has benefited from them.\r\nResources for international technical cooperation have\r\ndeclined. The move to market-based development has been\r\naccompanied by attempts to transfer to the private sector\r\nthe burden of cooperation for international development. As\r\nthe Non-Aligned Countries did at the Cartagena Summit\r\nConference, Colombia here reaffirms the role of the State\r\nin development and in international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs the Non-Aligned Movement also recognized at\r\nCartagena, the post-cold-war era provides opportunities and\r\nchallenges for the dialogue on international economic\r\ncooperation. To deal with development, focusing both on\r\neconomic growth and the eradication of poverty, there will\r\nhave to be greater coordination among developing countries\r\nin order to strengthen their capacity to act and to bring an\r\nintegrated approach to dealing with new problems. We\r\ncannot accept attempts to use issues such as environmental\r\nprotection, intellectual property, the protection of human\r\nrights and investments to restrict developing countries’\r\naccess to markets or to assistance and technology.\r\nThe struggle of developing countries to eradicate\r\npoverty, achieve economic and social progress and attain\r\nconditions of sustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment has as a prerequisite sine qua non the\r\nestablishment of a more propitious and dynamic economic\r\nenvironment.\r\nColombia fully agrees with two particularly\r\nimportant aspects of the General Assembly resolutions.\r\nThere must be an integrated approach to the\r\nimplementation of the results of the Summit within the\r\nframework of a coordinated follow-up of the major\r\ninternational conferences in the economic, social and\r\nrelated fields. Also, it is essential that the International\r\nLabour Organization be assigned to act in the\r\nemployment sphere, which is fundamental in dealing with\r\nthe problem of social development.\r\nMr. Alhitti (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): We\r\nwelcome the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development.\r\nParticularly since the end of the cold war, all the\r\nStates of the world, and especially the developing and\r\nleast-developed countries, have given growing importance\r\nto the question of social and economic development. This\r\ntrend is certainly right and appropriate, and given the\r\ndirect relationship between development and international\r\nsecurity and stability, it requires increased moral and\r\nmaterial support and participation of all parties. The\r\nquestion of development is not just a question for the\r\nthird world, but for all the countries of the world, because\r\nthe advantages of stability and international security,\r\nwhich are strengthened by development and its\r\nadvantages, benefit all countries of the world without\r\nexception, guaranteeing an environment of peace and\r\nsecurity. This, in turn, has a positive impact on\r\ndevelopment. And thus the cycle of poverty, hunger and\r\nunderdevelopment can be broken and replaced by a cycle\r\nthat will harmoniously lead all of humanity toward greater\r\ndevelopment, progress and prosperity.\r\nIt might be useful here to stress one truism of which\r\nwe are all aware: development cannot be achieved\r\nwithout the effective deployment of all material means\r\nand human resources. As regards material means,\r\ninternational commercial relations have currently reached\r\nan important turning point, as a result of the economic-\r\ngrowth imbalance between North and South that we have\r\nexperienced in recent decades. A large portion of the\r\npopulation of the South is now overwhelmed by debt,\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\npoverty and underdevelopment. Further, there is a great\r\ndisparity in technological development and progress\r\nbetween North and South, and this has produced serious\r\nproblems that are hamstringing the development of the\r\ncountries of the South. The counterpart is that the\r\ndeveloped countries are accumulating wealth and exploiting\r\nthe raw materials and resources of the developing countries.\r\nAll these factors, separately and together, are contributing\r\nto a greater deterioration of social development in many\r\ncountries of the world.\r\nIn the area of the development of human resources,\r\nthe situation is as grave as that involving material means,\r\nbecause illiteracy, poverty, hunger and disease, as well as\r\ndiscrimination, are continuing to spread in many countries.\r\nThis has a very negative impact on development.\r\nWith regard to the implementation by Iraq of the\r\nrecommendations of the Copenhagen Summit, I regret to\r\ninform the Assembly that my country has not been able to\r\nimplement any because of the economic sanctions that have\r\nbeen imposed upon it. Also, there is a need to re-examine\r\nmany of the negative practices that are without doubt\r\nhampering development, if not stopping it completely.\r\nWe wish to draw attention to the regrettable fact that\r\nthe negative role played by certain United Nations agencies\r\nhas hampered or even blocked the development of certain\r\ndeveloping countries through the imposition of economic\r\nsanctions against their peoples, which has had an overall\r\nnegative effect on the development process and on the\r\ninhabitants of those countries.\r\nWe are not making these problems up. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral dealt in a detailed manner with the question of\r\nsanctions in his report, “Supplement to an Agenda for\r\nPeace”:\r\n“They can conflict with the development objectives of\r\nthe Organization and do long-term damage to the\r\nproductive capacity of the target country. They can\r\nhave a severe effect on other countries that are\r\nneighbours or major economic partners of the target\r\ncountry.” (A/50/60, para. 70)\r\nI would mention also the most recent report of the\r\nGeneral Assembly Subgroup on the Question of United\r\nNations-imposed Sanctions, which recommended rigour and\r\ncaution in the imposition of sanctions against States. That\r\nSubgroup advised that sanctions be resorted to only when\r\nall peaceful means of settling disputes have been exhausted;\r\nthat did not happen in the case of Iraq. It highlighted the\r\nneed to define conditions for the imposition, lifting and\r\nduration of sanctions and to take all necessary measures\r\nto protect civilians and the development of the target\r\ncountry. That did not happen either in the case of Iraq; a\r\nsort of carte blanche blockade of indeterminate duration\r\nhas been imposed against my country. Mrs. Graça\r\nMachel, the expert of the Secretary-General, reached the\r\nsame conclusion in her report on the impact of armed\r\nconflict on children (A/51/306), which was submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly last year.\r\nThe unrestricted use of economic sanctions in recent\r\nyears has made it clear that the Charter of the United\r\nNations has serious shortcomings in the area of sanctions\r\nwith respect to their application and scope; their impact\r\non development and human rights in the target country,\r\nincluding the right to food, medicine, education and\r\nemployment; and mechanisms for easing or lifting them.\r\nThat shortcoming has allowed certain countries within the\r\nSecurity Council to transform sanctions — measures that\r\nshould be resorted to only in exceptional cases in order to\r\nresolve international conflicts — into a tool of revenge\r\nused to starve peoples, to impede their development\r\nprogrammes, and in some cases even to set back their\r\ndevelopment.\r\nA brief review of the nature of these sanctions\r\nshows to what extent they have been applied so as to\r\ndeprive the Iraqi people of their most basic human rights\r\nalong with their right to development. For instance, the\r\nsanctions Committee has refused to grant to Iraq the right\r\nto buy tires, children’s pencils, ambulances or water-\r\npurification products because one Committee member\r\nclaims that these basic necessities strengthen Iraq’s\r\ninfrastructure and also that they could be used for other\r\npurposes. It is as if he were saying that his country does\r\nnot want Iraq to possess a solid economic infrastructure\r\nand that his Government wishes to destroy our country’s\r\neconomy.\r\nWe wish to state briefly our belief that sanctions and\r\nthe manner in which they are applied call into question\r\nthe credibility of the Organization, its code of ethics and\r\nthe spirit of its Charter and of its provisions. Sanctions\r\nare an inhumane and ineffective tool because the\r\ncountries — members of the Security Council — that\r\nhave resorted to their imposition have done so by using\r\nthe United Nations to achieve their own political goals,\r\nwhich are incompatible with the objectives of the\r\nOrganization in promoting international peace, stability\r\nand security and fruitful cooperation among States.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nA quick look at United Nations resolutions and at the\r\nreports of international and non-governmental bodies makes\r\nclear the very serious impact that the blockade has had on\r\ndevelopment and in particular on the population. There is\r\nnot the shadow of a doubt that the negative impact of the\r\nsanctions has by far overshadowed any possible gain.\r\nNumbers and statistics bear this out, indicating that five\r\ntimes as many people died as a direct result of the\r\neconomic blockade as did in the bombing of Hiroshima.\r\nThe blockade, therefore, is a weapon of mass destruction.\r\nAnd that is not to mention the country’s stalled\r\ndevelopment, the deterioration of the educational system,\r\nilliteracy, widespread poverty and famine.\r\nThis process of destruction is a premeditated form of\r\ngenocide against the people of Iraq and therefore a practice\r\nthat runs counter to the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide and to the\r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the\r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural\r\nRights. For instance, recent statistics show that last June,\r\nmore than 4,434 children under the age of 5 died, as\r\nagainst 593 in 1989; and more than 6,460 children over the\r\nage of 5 died, as against 1,685 in 1989.\r\nOne day we will have to ask ourselves how the\r\nvarious United Nations agencies have dealt with the\r\neconomic and social development of a country victimized\r\nby outdated resolutions that have no moral or legal basis.\r\nMr. Somavía (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish): It\r\nis an honour and a pleasure for me to comment, on behalf\r\nof Chile, on agenda item 46, “Implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development”. I\r\nshould like at the outset to state that we support the\r\nimportant statements on this item made by Tanzania on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and by Paraguay on behalf of the\r\nRio Group.\r\nI should like at this point to take stock of what has\r\nbeen achieved since the holding of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development and also to look to the future, to\r\nCopenhagen + 5, to the special session of the General\r\nAssembly to be held in the year 2000, in order to assess the\r\ncommitments entered into in the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action and to develop them further.\r\nWhy must we look to the near future at this stage?\r\nFirst of all, because only by having clear in mind our long-\r\nterm, fundamental objectives can we ensure that the manner\r\nin which the Summit is being implemented is in keeping\r\nwith what was actually agreed in Copenhagen. Secondly,\r\nbecause Rio + 5 — although outstanding in terms of the\r\nhigh level of participation and the confirmation of the\r\nUnited Nations as the international forum for dealing with\r\nthe question of the environment — was not as successful\r\nas many of us had hoped. That was because we basically\r\nrepeated the exercise that took place five years ago in\r\nRio — reopening negotiations on the text of a document\r\nthat had already been agreed to, or simply repeating\r\nlanguage that had been used in the past.\r\nThis must not happen with Copenhagen + 5. We\r\ncannot confine ourselves, at the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly — which will coincide with the\r\nbeginning of the twenty-first century — to negotiating\r\nonce again commitments that have already been entered\r\ninto. Rather, we should take this opportunity to\r\ncommemorate the fifth anniversary of the Summit in a\r\ncompletely innovative fashion.\r\nI believe that it is possible to plan a special session\r\nthat would be different from the routine, one that would\r\nfocus on adopting a considerable number of major\r\ninitiatives to implement the outcome of the Summit —\r\naction-oriented initiatives, and initiatives of\r\nimplementation — and on negotiations not on texts but on\r\nspecific action at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels. Let me share some of my ideas about what a\r\nsession on specific initiatives should look like.\r\nFirst of all, such a session should ideally have the\r\nability to bring together all the real actors: Governments,\r\nparliaments, political parties, labour, business, banks,\r\nfinancial institutions, civil-society organizations, religious\r\nleaders, mayors, local leaders and the media. We must\r\nmake use of their imagination and their sense of\r\ncollective responsibility. If we genuinely want to\r\nimplement the Copenhagen documents, each of them will\r\nhave a major role to play — not only Governments,\r\nwhich must set the framework, but also individual actors\r\nwith the means and the tools at the level of their own\r\nactivities to achieve the Summit objectives.\r\nWe must recall that the Social Summit was an\r\nintergovernmental meeting with many parallel activities;\r\nthis was a traditional way of organizing such a\r\nconference. But I would like to see an Assembly session\r\nthat would bring together all these other actors, so that\r\nthey too could promote and adopt initiatives within the\r\nscope of their respective activities. In other words, the\r\nUnited Nations should provide a space in which society\r\nas a whole can share in the work of implementing the\r\noutcome of the Social Summit, with its own projects. We\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nmust be ambitious, as we were with the World Summit\r\nitself; we can thus achieve goals we thought difficult to\r\nattain.\r\nAt that session I would want to see the world’s\r\ngreatest concentration of social actors, working together on\r\nthe central issue: people. Only the United Nations can do\r\nthis. The Copenhagen Summit was the greatest meeting of\r\nHeads of State in history; why can we not do the same for\r\nsocial actors?\r\nLet me speak of some initiatives that the year-2000\r\nspecial session could promote. First, we could formulate a\r\nlegally binding convention aimed at the eradication of\r\npoverty. We discussed this during the Summit’s preparatory\r\nprocess, but many felt that it was premature and that we\r\nfirst needed the political commitment to eradicate poverty.\r\nThat was achieved with the Copenhagen Declaration. This\r\nworldwide commitment already provides a rallying point;\r\nnow we must move forward and make it legally binding\r\nwithin a realistic time-frame.\r\nSecond, we could work to ensure the integrated\r\ndevelopment of grass-roots communities. Would it really be\r\nutterly impossible for us to focus on the 20 per cent of the\r\nworld’s communities that are the neediest, and to take\r\ntargeted action based on the needs they themselves define,\r\nthus to eliminate absolute poverty, to create local jobs, to\r\nstimulate microcredit, to eliminate violence, to set up health\r\ncentres, and to fill other basic needs at the community\r\nlevel? In short, we must address the diverse basic problems\r\naffecting people living on the edge. These are issues that\r\nneed to be dealt with both at the local and municipal levels\r\nand at the national level. Here, a commitment by local\r\nauthorities is fundamentally important.\r\nThird, a critical issue underscored at Rio+5 was the\r\ndegree of subsidy required by non-sustainable development.\r\nWe must study current financial systems, which are full of\r\ninconsistencies and anomalies, and provide incentives for\r\nsustainable development. We must understand the true\r\nimpact of today’s financial system; otherwise, we will be\r\nunable to use it to provide incentives for overall\r\ndevelopment. We need “friendly” financial systems to\r\ncreate jobs and to care for the environment.\r\nFourth, we must develop new ways of using private\r\ncapital to meet social needs — not as charity, but as good\r\nbusiness. It is important to recall that the business sector\r\nparticipated actively in the World Summit process. We\r\nmust recognize that the notion that private capital can\r\nprovide goods and services to meet social needs has been\r\nalien to those who are used to thinking in terms of public\r\nspending for such purposes. The private sector too has\r\ntraditionally felt that investments in this sphere lie within\r\nthe purview of the public sector. I think that there is a\r\ngreat opportunity here — and not in terms of incentives\r\nfor private businesses to devote a small portion of their\r\nprofits to social ends. It is proper that this should be done\r\non a voluntary basis. I am thinking rather of encouraging\r\ncommercial investment that would yield profits, but that\r\nwould also provide goods and services that could help\r\naddress social problems. There must be further\r\ndeliberations on this subject, and all parties must be ready\r\nto study it in a creative way. Chile has had successful\r\nexperiences in the sphere of preventive social action.\r\nFifth, there is an obvious need to set up some kind\r\nof worldwide cooperation for the creation of more and\r\nbetter jobs. Job-creation must be at the heart of economic\r\npolicy. The financial resources are there, but will and\r\ndetermination are lacking. Jobs must be at the centre of\r\nthe economy if we want people to be at the centre of\r\ndevelopment. We must harmonize our macro-economic\r\nand our micro-social policies. We must be clear that\r\nnations cannot achieve economic stability while\r\ndestabilizing the lives of their peoples.\r\nHappily, we have progressed beyond the kinds of\r\nstructural-adjustment policies followed in the 1980s,\r\nthanks in good measure to abundant criticism from many\r\nquarters, including from United Nations agencies and at\r\nthe World Summit itself. But we still need a world\r\nconsensus that only the creation of more and better jobs\r\nwill enable us to reach the Summit goals. Jobs have a\r\ncrucial role to play in reducing poverty and in promoting\r\nsocial integration: those are two other major issues of the\r\nSummit.\r\nSixth, it is critical to halt the decline in international\r\ncooperation. We know of course that the richest countries\r\nare facing internal problems, both in their economies and\r\nwith respect to public opinion, and that perhaps their\r\nassistance cannot be so generous or unconditional as it\r\nwas in the past. It is true also that there have been\r\nmistakes, and that assistance has not always been properly\r\nused. But to my mind, that is not the point. The real point\r\nis that, given the structure of modern-day economic\r\nrelations, we cannot hope that countries will achieve\r\ndevelopment solely on the basis of private investment.\r\nIn many cases, of course, this could be the path to\r\nfollow, but certainly not in every case. To reduce\r\ninternational cooperation at a time when protectionism is\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\non the rise, and to expect that this will ensure world\r\nstability, is absolutely impossible. Therefore, we urgently\r\nneed to convince public opinion, Parliaments and the media\r\nin the countries of the North of the reality that international\r\ncooperation is a strategic element of world stability and not\r\na question of willingness or unwillingness to provide\r\nfunding or of need at the national level. This is a key\r\ncomponent because it should be earmarked for specific\r\nneeds that cannot otherwise be met.\r\nAs established in the Copenhagen Declaration of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, there are real social\r\nproblems in each country, but, it is not with policies of\r\nisolation that the countries of the North will find the\r\nstability they seek. Cooperation, however, is primarily a\r\npolitical issue. It is not merely a matter of adopting\r\nresolutions, but also of bringing together those actors that\r\nare prepared to take practical steps to achieve it.\r\nSeventh, we urgently need to develop initiatives of\r\nsolidarity among the countries of the third world. The\r\nSummit process was very decisive in this respect. I put a\r\ngreat deal of emphasis on recognizing the special situation\r\nof Africa and the need for us to adopt a specific\r\ncommitment to Africa and to the less advanced countries.\r\nIt was not easy to achieve agreement on this, because other\r\ndeveloping countries in other geographical areas were\r\nconcerned about the implications of differentiating or\r\ndividing the countries of the third world in this way. It\r\nseems to me, on the contrary, that we, among ourselves,\r\nshould apply to the third world the same principles and\r\nvalues that we expect the developed world to apply to it. If\r\nwe are not prepared to recognize the special difficulties of\r\nsome of our developing countries and to support them\r\naccordingly, then we cannot really expect a similar stance\r\nfrom the developed countries vis-à-vis the developing world\r\nin general. I would suggest that the 30 most developed\r\nnations of the third world, however we define them, begin\r\nto develop initiatives of solidarity with other developing\r\ncountries to implement the outcome of the World Summit\r\non Social Development. Nothing would do more to\r\nreinforce the vision of change at the international level, and\r\nnothing would be more emblematic of the new way in\r\nwhich these issues could be dealt with than the third\r\nworld’s setting the example.\r\nFinally, on the basis of the experience of the Summit\r\nand that of other world conferences, we can assess the\r\nimpact on them by organizations of civil society, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and others. This was especially\r\ntrue with regard to Copenhagen. However, the problem for\r\norganizations of civil society as a whole is that they are\r\norganized into sectors: organizations of women concerned\r\nprimarily with women’s issues, ecologists concerned with\r\nthe environment, human rights organizations concerned\r\nwith human rights, and so on. There are some cross-\r\nsectoral ties between these organizations, but, in spite of\r\nall their efforts, they tend to have partial information and\r\nrarely work together.\r\nOn the other hand, there are social actors that play\r\nwhat could be called a structural role in today’s economy,\r\nbut for the most part are not organized. We could speak\r\nof putting private enterprise at the service of social\r\ndevelopment, the great advantage of which is that both\r\nsides benefit. However, in the final analysis, a business is\r\nable to have earnings because there are consumers for its\r\nproducts. Investment is the key, as is accumulation. The\r\nability of private investment to generate wealth is\r\nessential, as there can be no distribution without the\r\ncreation of wealth. However, that process depends in turn\r\non individuals to consume what is available in the market.\r\nAs a result, organizing all of us as consumers —\r\nlike the union workers who organized themselves in the\r\npast to defend their interests — seems to be a central\r\nelement. But here I am focusing primarily on the fact that\r\nall sectors of civil society continue working without\r\ncoordination between them, and it would be a major\r\nobjective to have some kind of forum of the sort we are\r\nthinking about in the General Assembly, to initiate a\r\nlarge, global framework for civil society, to interconnect\r\nall these various sectors and to establish a high-level\r\nagenda on common issues on which to act together. The\r\nSocial Summit issues — the eradication of poverty, full\r\nemployment and social integration — are clearly part of\r\nthat common agenda.\r\nFinally, in terms of specific initiatives that could be\r\ncarried out using the Summit as a launching pad,\r\nacademic centres supported by the United Nations\r\nResearch Institute for Social Development could focus\r\ntheir research on the major obstacles to the\r\nimplementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nIn conclusion, those who constantly criticize may\r\nwell say that these ideas are all well and good, but that in\r\nsubstance nothing will change and that things will remain\r\nas they are because the international community is not\r\nprepared to work with imagination for the future. That is\r\nwhat they are going to say. But I would like to recall that\r\nexactly the same things were said when, five years ago,\r\nthe work began on organizing the World Summit for\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nSocial Development. The argument was that social\r\ndevelopment was not a world issue, that it would be very\r\ndifficult to get the developed countries to make a\r\ncommitment to this process, that this would be just one\r\nmore conference that would end with the classic appeals\r\nfrom the South for a distribution of resources from the\r\nNorth — a litany of reasons as to why the Social Summit,\r\nfirst of all, would not take place and, secondly, if it did\r\ntake place, it would be a failure. The truth is that there was\r\na political framework for the Social Summit, and the results\r\nof the special session of the General Assembly under\r\npreparation also are going to depend on the commitment of\r\nall and on a clear identification of the political framework.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that whenever I am faced\r\nwith cynicism, I recall Oscar Wilde, who said that cynics\r\nknow the price of everything but the value of nothing.\r\nSome might feel that I sometimes go to the opposite\r\nextreme and that I am too insistent. I am prepared to accept\r\nthis, but the truth is that I believe deeply that our personal\r\nattitudes and our attitudes as States are very important. We\r\ncan always emphasize difficulties and problems, but,\r\ncontrariwise, we can always also focus on our own strength\r\nto confront those difficulties and seek to maximize our joint\r\ncapacity to do it.\r\nIt was said that slavery would never disappear, that\r\nunions would never be established, that women would\r\nnever vote, that the idea of human rights and the\r\ndemocratic process would never be reaffirmed in the world,\r\nthat decolonization was impossible, that the Berlin Wall\r\nwould stand for ever, that apartheid would never end. But\r\nthese things did take place, and they took place because\r\npeople did not allow themselves to become discouraged\r\nwhen faced with difficulties; on the contrary, they decided\r\nto act in unity and to maintain the integrity, the conviction\r\nand the values that make things happen.\r\nThis is the point we have reached with the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. The process led to a\r\nsuccessful start, but we still have battles to fight. It is worth\r\nour while to participate in those battles and to plan well for\r\nthem. There is no vision without organization. If vision is\r\naccompanied by organization and by the capacity to reach\r\nconsensus, through a will to listen and to learn from others,\r\nthen we can make progress. Fundamental differences, and\r\nrespect for cultural diversity and various spiritual traditions,\r\nare key in social questions. Consequently, we must make\r\nprogress in this sphere through a willingness and a\r\ncommitment to listen to others.\r\nIf we have the power to change the world, then we\r\nmust look within ourselves — at our conviction, desires\r\nand capacity to listen to and to work with others and to\r\narrive at consensus. We must never believe that what\r\nappears impossible today cannot be achieved tomorrow.\r\nEverything that once was impossible is finally brought\r\nabout by the persistence of human will.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with the\r\ndecision taken by the General Assembly at its 32nd\r\nplenary meeting, held on 16 October 1997, I now call\r\nupon the Observer of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Martino (Holy See): We now stand\r\nmidway between the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and the special session of the General\r\nAssembly to be held in the year 2000 for the overall\r\nreview and appraisal of the implementation of the\r\noutcome of that Summit.\r\nAt the Copenhagen Summit the family of nations\r\ncame together at the level of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment to make solemn commitments concerning a\r\nnew vision of development, which would have at its\r\ncentre the human person. It was a moment of hope and\r\nexpectation for many, including the wide range of\r\nrepresentatives of civil society who worked constructively\r\nwith the Governments to look at the challenges of\r\npoverty, of creating productive employment and of broad\r\nsocial integration.\r\nWe must not disappoint this hope and expectation.\r\nIf we come to the review process with positive results, we\r\nwill give a real boost to the confidence of our people in\r\nthe United Nations system. If we come to the review\r\nprocess having made little progress, or even registering\r\nreduced consensus around our commitments, we will lend\r\na new weapon to those who wish to sow scepticism about\r\nthe ability of the United Nations to address the real issues\r\nof people.\r\nToday, my delegation would like to address three\r\nspecific themes which must be examined in the short\r\nperiod of time before the review session. The first theme\r\nis poverty. For many, the Social Summit was seen as the\r\n“poverty Summit”, because at Copenhagen it was clearly\r\nrecognized that it is possible to rapidly reduce and\r\nultimately to eliminate, within a determinate period, the\r\nhumiliating scourge of extreme poverty. The means to\r\neliminate extreme poverty exist. Countries agreed to put\r\nin place clear strategies by the end of 1996. How can we\r\ncelebrate the jubilee year 2000, how can we pass with\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nhonour into the new millennium, if we fail to report to the\r\nreview session clear and sustained progress in the fight\r\nagainst extreme poverty?\r\nI note in passing that today we are observing the\r\nInternational Day for the Eradication of Poverty. I should\r\nlike to quote the appeal made by Pope John Paul II for this\r\noccasion:\r\n“I renew my appeal that each person may commit\r\nhimself, according to his own responsibilities, to\r\neliminating the causes of poverty. May no one remain\r\nindifferent to those wounded by life! The Church, with\r\ngreat respect and affection, is alongside all those\r\nwhom poverty deprives of their dignity, of their family\r\nlife, of the opportunity to receive an education and to\r\nhave a job. They are our brothers and sisters, whom\r\nChrist loves with particular preference. They await our\r\nconcrete solidarity.”\r\nA second, more complex, theme which my delegation\r\nwould like to address is the significance today of social and\r\neconomic rights. The indivisibility of human rights, as well\r\nas their universal character, has been reaffirmed repeatedly\r\nby the international community over the past years. It is a\r\nprinciple which must be reaffirmed also in the celebration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. But today there are also disquieting\r\ntendencies which reduce the significance of social and\r\neconomic rights, considering them mere “aspirations”, and\r\ntaking away from them their specific character as “rights”.\r\nThe full realization of these rights, it is clear, will only\r\nbe accomplished gradually. But we must not allow the\r\nconcept of “gradualism” to mean “indefinite postponement”.\r\nIn the complexity of modern societies and economies,\r\nGovernments on their own will not be the sole actors in the\r\nrealization of these rights. Their realization will require,\r\namong other aspects, the putting into place of policies\r\nwhich enable the market, the private sector and civil\r\nsociety, as well as public authorities on the local, regional\r\nand national level, to work constructively together. The\r\ncomplexity of the realization of these rights in society must\r\nnot, however, reduce their significance as rights for each\r\nindividual. When we speak of rights to nutrition, education,\r\nhealth, shelter, work, or development, we are really\r\nspeaking of the specific moral goods of each individual, of\r\nthe essential dimensions of his or her being a human\r\nperson.\r\nBeing deprived of these rights, suffering the\r\nhumiliating effects of such deprivation, can further lead to\r\na situation in which the possibility of the person\r\nexercising other fundamental rights is, de facto, greatly\r\ncurtailed. Where people are deprived of the possibility to\r\nfully enjoy the exercise of their social and economic\r\nrights, they so often enter into broader exclusion from full\r\nparticipation in society.\r\nThe third aspect which my delegation would like to\r\naddress is that of the financial means available for\r\ndevelopment assistance, and especially the crisis of\r\nofficial development assistance. The significant growth of\r\ndirect investment flows to the poorer countries has been\r\none of the most indicative factors for development policy\r\nin recent years. The future of development will be very\r\nmuch linked with the ability of poor countries to attract\r\nsuch investment and to see that it brings social\r\ndevelopment for their own people.\r\nBut there is a great imbalance in these flows, which\r\ngo principally to a handful of countries viewed as\r\nattractive. The poorest countries, if they are to attract\r\ninvestment, still require substantial official development\r\nassistance to remedy their comparative disadvantage.\r\nThey will need well-targeted assistance to improve their\r\nbasic infrastructures — not just physical infrastructures,\r\nbut also human ones, through improved education and\r\nhealth care, and social ones, through investment in the\r\nstructures of legality and governance.\r\nWhy are the funds currently available for official\r\ndevelopment assistance at an all-time low? It is true that\r\nin the past such funds have been badly utilized and have\r\nnot produced results. But spending, corruption and\r\nmismanagement marked the policies of donor and\r\nrecipient countries. Indeed, it is more and more obvious\r\ntoday how much the self-interested policies of donor\r\ncountries during the cold war and post-colonial periods\r\nhave had long-term distorting effects on the development\r\nprospects of many countries, indeed of entire regions.\r\nBut, it must be admitted, the reduction of official\r\ndevelopment assistance is more than a question of the\r\nrecognition of past errors or of donor fatigue. It is a\r\nquestion, in some cases, of a weakening of solidarity and\r\na growth of dangerous isolationism. My delegation\r\nstrongly rejects such tendencies. The question of\r\ninternational solidarity is not a mere policy issue: it is a\r\nquestion of the very nature of humanity, of the human\r\ncommunity to which we all belong. If the process of\r\nglobalization which is taking place in our world is to be\r\ntruly human, it requires the construction of a truly global\r\ncommunity, based on the common good of all humanity,\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 17 October 1997\r\nin which there is a sense of common responsibility for all,\r\nespecially for the weakest.\r\nThe Holy See would hope that one of the principal\r\nresults of the process of the implementation of the\r\nCopenhagen World Summit and the preparation of the\r\nreview conference in the year 2000 would be a renewed\r\ninternational consensus on the essential role of development\r\nassistance. It is certainly a question of identifying where\r\nand how such assistance can be best utilized. But it is\r\nabove all a question of the recognition that investment in\r\ninternational solidarity — a sure contribution to a more\r\nequitable, and thus a more stable world — is something\r\nwhich is for the good of all.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members of\r\nsome changes in and additions to the programme of work\r\nof the General Assembly contained in document\r\nA/INF/52/3.\r\nOn Wednesday morning, 22 October, the General\r\nAssembly will, as the first item, hear an address by the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique.
