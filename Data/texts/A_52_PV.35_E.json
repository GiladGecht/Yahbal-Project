(Ukraine)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Tello (Mexico),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of\r\nthe Republic of Mozambique\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe Assembly will first hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Mozambique.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Joaquim\r\nAlberto Chissano, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Chissano: On behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Mozambique, and indeed on my own\r\nbehalf, it is a great honour for me to address this august\r\nAssembly. I bring to you the warm felicitations and best\r\nwishes of all Mozambicans.\r\nTwo years ago, during the commemoration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we committed\r\nourselves not only to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war, but also to rededicate our efforts to\r\nachieve greater efficiency and effectiveness for our\r\nuniversal Organization, with a view to enabling it to play\r\na pivotal role in promoting sustainable development,\r\nparticularly in the developing countries. Therefore, our\r\ndeliberations in all subsequent General Assembly sessions\r\nshould reflect that firm political will and commitment.\r\nOn that occasion, I informed the Assembly of the\r\nprogress we had achieved in our continued endeavours to\r\nconsolidate peace and democracy and promote socio-\r\neconomic development. I am happy to state that, today,\r\nthese positive trends are prevailing and that the situation\r\nin my country is improving. We envision the future with\r\nrenewed optimism.\r\nOur pluralist democracy continues to flourish; we are\r\nfurther strengthening our democratic institutions; and the\r\nstate of the economy is gradually and steadily improving.\r\nHowever, many challenges lie ahead. We still have\r\nschools and hospitals to rehabilitate, and new ones to\r\nbuild. We still have roads to repair, and new ones to\r\nbuild. We still have landmines to clear. We have to\r\naddress our heavy debt burden and find ways and means\r\nof bringing it to sustainable levels.\r\nThese challenges are indeed immense, but not\r\ninsurmountable. With hard work and the generous support\r\nof the international community, I am sure we shall\r\nsucceed in our quest for better living standards for our\r\npeople. The United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity at large have invested a lot in order to ensure\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\na lasting peace and stability in Mozambique. I say to all the\r\nmembers of the international community: your effective\r\nwork has helped put an end to the suffering of our people\r\nin a delicate and complex peace process. The cost of peace\r\nwas high, but it would have been higher if you had failed\r\nto fulfil your obligations. We therefore urge you to\r\nrecommit yourselves to providing all necessary means for\r\nthe consolidation of the peace you have helped to achieve.\r\nThe advent of peace has made it possible for\r\nMozambicans to rededicate themselves to the\r\nimplementation of sound political and economic reforms,\r\nwith visible positive results. It is our earnest desire to take\r\nmaximum advantage of the rich potential of our natural\r\nresources and to use them in a sustainable and balanced\r\nmanner with a view to creating wealth and a better future\r\nfor our people.\r\nAs a result of the implementation of the structural\r\nadjustment programme, launched in 1987 under the most\r\nadverse conditions, encouraging developments are taking\r\nplace in our economy. In 1996 the gross domestic product\r\ngrew by around 6.4 per cent and exports increased by 24\r\nper cent. The inflation rate declined sharply to 16.6 per cent\r\nfrom 70 per cent in 1994 and 54 per cent in 1995. The\r\nmid-year evaluation indicates 3.2 per cent, and we expect\r\na single-digit cumulative rate for 1997. Moreover, we have\r\nalso registered important progress in currency stabilization.\r\nWe estimate that the 1997 figures for virtually all major\r\neconomic indicators will be better than the previous ones.\r\nOur successes in the consolidation of peace and\r\ndemocracy reflect the values our people have inherited\r\nthroughout history; they reflect our common desire and\r\nnoble aspirations to live together in unity and harmony\r\nwithin diversity, thanks to our growing culture of tolerance\r\nand forgiveness. They also constitute a vivid example of a\r\nculture of peace we have embraced in our country. We\r\nbelieve that the promotion and further consolidation of a\r\nculture of peace should be the next most important\r\nchallenge to all societies as well as to each individual\r\ncitizen.\r\nIt was within this framework that my Government, in\r\nclose collaboration with the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), convened\r\nat Maputo a conference on culture of peace and good\r\ngovernance. The outcome of this conference and of other\r\nsimilar conferences that have taken place worldwide was to\r\nrecognize once again the existing relationship between\r\npeace, democracy and development, as well as the common\r\nchallenges to all countries committed to implementing these\r\nvalues and processes. For these reasons, I welcome the\r\nefforts under way towards the adoption of a meaningful\r\ndraft resolution on this contemporary issue.\r\nPeace and stability cannot be ensured by the mere\r\nholding of multiparty elections, nor should they be seen\r\nas a simple absence of military conflict. Recent history\r\nproves that in conflict resolution a proper balance should\r\nbe struck between the need for elections, with their\r\ninherent hostile and partisan propaganda, and the need for\r\nreconciliation that should follow the aftermath of a\r\ndemocratic process.\r\nOur own experience reminds us that it is not enough\r\nto ensure reconciliation of former conflicting parties in\r\norder to guarantee a lasting peace. Our task today is to\r\nguarantee that a culture of peace is embedded in the\r\nminds of all citizens as an important step forward in\r\nconflict prevention and management. All citizens are\r\ncalled upon to participate, notwithstanding the diversity of\r\nopinions and sometimes of interests. Only commitment to\r\nsupreme national interests can ensure that individual\r\ninterests do not hamper these noble objectives.\r\nPeace and democracy are fundamental tools for\r\nfostering development in all its aspects, especially in\r\ntoday’s world, where one fifth of the world population is\r\nstill confronted with absolute poverty, hunger and\r\nmalnutrition, illiteracy and endemic disease. It is therefore\r\nincumbent upon all of us to take concerted actions in\r\norder to reverse this picture and to create an enabling\r\nenvironment for sustained development, with emphasis on\r\neducation and the provision of basic health care, potable\r\nwater and housing.\r\nThis requires the strengthening of the rule of law,\r\ngood governance, transparency and accountability. It also\r\nrequires security in all its components, including\r\neconomic, social, environmental and all related issues. As\r\nwe are about to cross the threshold of the new\r\nmillennium, the concept of security must be considered in\r\nits global dimension. No country, no matter how big or\r\nhow small, can develop in isolation. Indeed,\r\nenvironmental problems, refugees and displaced persons,\r\ntransboundary movements of people and goods, drug\r\ntrafficking, money laundering and other transnational\r\ncrimes can only be addressed effectively through a\r\ncooperative approach in a global context.\r\nWithout peace and democracy, development will\r\nalways be in jeopardy, and issues related to governance\r\nand social instability will continue to confront future\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\ngenerations. That is why democracy and development, two\r\nfaces of the same coin, remain a daunting challenge to our\r\nsocieties. This is an undertaking that requires a common\r\napproach from all Governments and from civil society,\r\nincluding the private sector.\r\nThese are equally the challenges facing the southern\r\nAfrican region today. Because we believe that only\r\ncollective efforts will bring about durable peace and\r\nstability and sustainable development, we attach great\r\nimportance to regional cooperation within the framework of\r\nthe Southern African Development Community (SADC).\r\nWith 14 member States and about 170 million people,\r\nSADC is a viable economic bloc poised to play a positive\r\nrole in the efforts for continental development.\r\nThe 1997 annual summit of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment of our Community reviewed the activities of\r\nthe organization and developments that had taken place in\r\nthe region since the last summit. Within the framework of\r\nthe establishment of the African Economic Community, and\r\nas one of its building blocks, we are, inter alia, according\r\ntop priority in our domestic agendas to issues pertaining to\r\nthe social development of our countries so as to ensure that\r\nour policies and strategies are in response to, and in support\r\nof, national priorities. Special emphasis is being given to\r\nthe need for investment in the development of technology\r\nand infrastructures.\r\nThe summit also considered the applications for\r\nmembership of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nthe Republic of Seychelles, and decided to welcome those\r\ncountries as the newest members of our Community.\r\nThe summit discussed in great detail the current\r\nsituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We\r\nhave agreed that the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nrequires and deserves support from the international\r\ncommunity in order to enable its newly established\r\nGovernment and its people to cope with the developmental\r\nchallenges deriving from three decades of uncertainty.\r\nA stable Democratic Republic of the Congo is equally\r\nvital for the attainment of the peace that has so far eluded\r\nthe Great Lakes region and for the efforts under way with\r\na view to finding a political settlement of the conflict\r\nravaging the neighbouring Congo.\r\nFurthermore, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nhas major strategic importance for the development of the\r\nregion, and indeed, of the whole continent of Africa, given\r\nits great potential in such key areas as energy, water,\r\ntourism, transport and communications.\r\nThe issue of transport and communication is of\r\nparamount importance to southern Africa. The\r\nestablishment of the Maputo, Beira and Nacala corridors\r\nare fundamental steps towards improving transport and\r\ncommunications within the region.\r\nThe concept of development corridors we are\r\nimplementing in southern Africa represents a new\r\npartnership we are building in the region between\r\nGovernment, entrepreneurs and communities. A\r\ndevelopment corridor is not only a road or railway linking\r\na harbour to one point at the border of a neighbouring\r\ncountry, but also, and more importantly, an area along the\r\ncommunications routes and beyond them into the interior\r\nof the countries concerned and open for investment in a\r\ngreat variety of economic activities, thus bringing about\r\nan integrated development of the region.\r\nThe areas of investment include improvements of sea\r\nports and railways; improvement and construction of\r\nhighways; and gas pipelines, energy and communications\r\ninfrastructures, livestock, forestry, agriculture, mining,\r\nmanufacturing, industry and tourism. We believe,\r\ntherefore, that the development corridors will contribute\r\nsignificantly towards the realization of the noble goals\r\nand aspirations of the peoples of the region.\r\nThis is the path we have embarked on in southern\r\nAfrica. We believe that, in so doing, we are making a\r\npositive contribution towards conflict prevention,\r\nresolution and management in Africa, and to building the\r\nblocks that shall sustain the development of our continent.\r\nIn order to guarantee political stability as well as the\r\nsustainability of our development efforts, the region has\r\nestablished, within SADC, an Organ on Politics, Defence\r\nand Security with the responsibility of preventing,\r\nresolving and managing conflicts in the region.\r\nThis is the future that we envisage for the African\r\ncontinent: a continent in which the rule of law and\r\nlegitimacy is above all other interests; a continent in\r\nwhich democracy, accountability and good governance\r\nmust prevail; a continent in which development and social\r\njustice are promoted and safeguarded by all of us. This is\r\nwhere cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity must be further\r\nstrengthened.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank His\r\nExcellency the President of the Republic of Mozambique\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 7\r\nNotification by the Secretary-General under Article 12,\r\nparagraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/52/392)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nAs members are aware, in accordance with the provisions\r\nof Article 12, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United\r\nNations and with the consent of the Security Council, the\r\nSecretary-General is mandated to notify the General\r\nAssembly of matters relative to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security that are being dealt with by\r\nthe Security Council and of matters with which the Council\r\nhas ceased to deal.\r\nIn this connection, the General Assembly has before\r\nit a note by the Secretary-General issued as document\r\nA/52/392.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of that\r\ndocument?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other\r\nelections\r\n(b) Election of seven members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/52/440)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly decision 42/450 of\r\n17 December 1987, the Assembly elects the members of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination upon their\r\nnomination by the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/52/440,\r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee,\r\nwhich will occur as a result of the expiration on 31\r\nDecember 1997 of the terms of office of the Bahamas,\r\nBenin, France, Ghana, Mexico, the Russian Federation\r\nand the United States of America. Those States are\r\neligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1\r\nJanuary 1998, the following States will still be members\r\nof the Committee: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cameroon,\r\nChina, the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nEgypt, Germany, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nJapan, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, the Republic\r\nof Korea, Romania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, Uruguay and Zimbabwe.\r\nTherefore, those 25 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nThe following States have been nominated by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council: two African States for two\r\nvacancies — Uganda and Zambia; one Eastern European\r\nState for one vacancy — the Russian Federation; two\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States for two\r\nvacancies — the Bahamas and Mexico; two Western\r\nEuropean and other States for two vacancies — the\r\nUnited States of America and France.\r\nAs stated in document A/52/440, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council has postponed to a future session of the\r\nCouncil the nomination of two other members from the\r\nWestern European and other States for a term beginning\r\non the date of election and expiring on 31 December\r\n1999.\r\nThe number of States nominated from among the\r\nAfrican States, the Eastern European States, the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and the Western European\r\nand other States is equal to or does not exceed the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled in each of those regions.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nall elections shall be held by secret ballot. However, in\r\naccordance with paragraph 16 of decision 34/401, the\r\nAssembly may, in elections to subsidiary organs, dispense\r\nwith secret balloting when the number of candidates\r\ncorresponds to the number of seats to be filled.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nMay I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes to\r\ndeclare those States nominated by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil from among the African States, the Eastern\r\nEuropean States, the Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nand the Western European and other States — the\r\nBahamas, France, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Uganda,\r\nthe United States of America and Zambia — elected\r\nmembers of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination for a three-year term beginning on 1 January\r\n1998?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI congratulate the States that have been elected members of\r\nthe Committee for Programme and Coordination.\r\nWith regard to the two remaining vacancies to be\r\nfilled from among the Western European and other States,\r\nthe General Assembly will be in a position to act on them\r\nupon the nomination by the Economic and Social Council\r\nof two Member States from that region.\r\nI therefore propose that the Assembly keep this sub-\r\nitem on the agenda of the fifty-second session.\r\nIf I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Assembly\r\nagrees to that procedure.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 25\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/376)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.6)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nPeru to introduce draft resolution A/52/L.6.\r\nMr. Guillén (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nhave the honour to introduce, under agenda item 25, the\r\ndraft resolution entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Latin American Economic System”, which\r\nis sponsored by the 27 member States of the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System (SELA).\r\nWe are grateful for the report contained in document\r\nA/52/376, which the Secretary-General has submitted to\r\nthe Member States of the United Nations in accordance\r\nwith resolution 50/14, adopted by consensus at a previous\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nThe draft resolution introduced today has no\r\nfinancial implications, and its content is similar to those\r\nof the resolution adopted unanimously at the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI am pleased to report, however, that between the\r\nadoption of resolution 50/14 two years ago and the\r\npresent draft, SELA has taken a series of decisions that\r\nare worth mentioning here, by way of complementing the\r\nreport. The report refers to the work done by the system\r\nbefore the adoption of the resolution and, naturally, since\r\nit refers only to cooperation between SELA and\r\nspecialized agencies of the system, it has not taken into\r\naccount important decisions that have been reached, in\r\nparticular at the recent meeting of the Latin American\r\nCouncil, held in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nfrom 6 to 9 October of this year, to which I shall refer\r\nmomentarily.\r\nFrom 1995 to the present SELA has accomplished a\r\nfundamental reorientation and adaptation in order to\r\nachieve two main objectives: first, to help the 27\r\nmembers become integrated into the current international\r\nenvironment and, secondly, to coordinate their agendas\r\nfor regional, hemispheric and international actions. This\r\nlatter aspect is of particular importance because SELA is\r\nthe only system that encompasses all the subregions of\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\r\nThe Council has therefore concentrated its\r\nendeavours on eight thematic areas, deemed priorities for\r\ndevelopment. These include analysing the process of\r\nglobalization of the international economy, tracking the\r\nrelations of the countries of the region with their principal\r\neconomic partners and using computers to disseminate\r\ninformation.\r\nAll this is contained in a summary entitled “A\r\ncurrent vision of SELA”, which was prepared by SELA\r\nat the request of the Latin American and Caribbean\r\nGroup. This is not a United Nations document, but it is\r\navailable in English and Spanish and includes an index of\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nthe recent studies conducted by SELA, which are also\r\navailable on the Internet.\r\nThe meeting of the Latin American Council at Port-of-\r\nSpain was focused on the theme “growth and employment”\r\nbecause the member Governments were of the view that\r\nadjustment and restructuring policies were falling short of\r\nresolving the problems besetting the most disadvantaged\r\nsectors of the region’s populations: youth and women. In\r\nthat regard, at that meeting 10 specific points for action\r\nwere laid out, and they are contained in the aforementioned\r\nsummary.\r\nThe next meeting of the Latin American Council, in\r\n1998, will focus on the theme “the dynamics of external\r\nrelations of Latin America and the Caribbean” and will no\r\ndoubt also take into account the results of the second\r\nHemispheric Summit and the preparatory work for the\r\nbiregional summit of Latin America and the European\r\nUnion, to be held early in 1999.\r\nAll this means that the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem, with its relatively modest resources, is making\r\navailable to the countries of the region the capacity to\r\ncoordinate regional and subregional actions that coincide\r\nwith the priorities laid down in the international agenda. All\r\nthis is being done in coordination and cooperation with\r\norganizations such as those mentioned in the draft\r\nresolution we are introducing.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nregional project entitled “Support to SELA”, a project of\r\ngreat importance to Latin America and the Caribbean, came\r\nto an end last year. We request that — to the extent\r\npossible, and in accordance with the decisions of the\r\nExecutive Board, which are binding for UNDP, this\r\ncooperation will not be completely lacking.\r\nThe countries of Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nhope that — as part of the reorientation of international\r\ncooperation, which calls for efficiency and realistic goals —\r\nthe work done by SELA will be given due consideration.\r\nMr. Pino (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe delegation of Venezuela wishes to express its particular\r\ninterest in co-sponsoring the draft resolution on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and Latin American Economic\r\nSystem (SELA), which was introduced by the delegation of\r\nPeru.\r\nWe are firmly convinced that SELA has been and will\r\ncontinue to be an effective and efficient instrument for\r\nconsultation, coordination and cooperation among the\r\nnations of our Latin American and Caribbean region. In\r\nfact, SELA is making invaluable efforts in promoting the\r\ncoordination of governmental policies in priority areas for\r\nour countries, such as economic integration, the active\r\nparticipation of our region in world trade, social\r\ndevelopment, technical cooperation, financing and\r\ninvestment, among others.\r\nConsultation and coordination activities intended to\r\nharmonize common positions and strategies of the\r\ncountries of our region in the economic field, offer the\r\nregion ways to take more appropriate actions in order to\r\nbecome part of the demanding globalized economy now\r\nconfronting us. In addition, SELA’s analyses, activities\r\nand publications have enabled us to identify specific\r\nsolutions to specific problems. In this context, the\r\nrelationship of SELA, through formal coordination\r\nmechanisms, with United Nations bodies and other\r\nregional and extraregional organizations, such as the\r\nAndean Development Corporation, the Inter-American\r\nDevelopment Bank, the Organization of American States\r\nand the Caribbean Community, to mention but a few, has\r\nenabled us to make more efficient use of the technical\r\nand financial resources available to the region.\r\nSince its establishment in 1975, the Latin American\r\nEconomic System (SELA) has maintained a productive,\r\ncooperative relationship with the United Nations. Over the\r\nyears that relationship has been strengthened and\r\ndiversified to the benefit of the countries of our region.\r\nOn this occasion we wish to appeal to the bodies\r\nand programmes of the United Nations system to continue\r\nto provide increasing support for the work carried out by\r\nthe Latin American Economic System.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The delegation of Argentina would like to make\r\na brief statement to express its support for the promotion\r\nof and the search for new cooperation mechanisms\r\nbetween the Latin American Economic System (SELA)\r\nand the United Nations. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, which describes in detail the progress\r\nmade in the area of cooperation among United Nations\r\norganizations, agencies and programmes, with particular\r\nemphasis on the relationship between SELA and the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC).\r\nThe adoption of free-market policies, the opening up\r\nof trade, decreased State intervention, and economic\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nintegration have effectively increased the efficiency of\r\ninterregional mechanisms to revitalize trade, increase\r\nproduction, encourage investment and promote\r\ntechnological development. Likewise, the process of\r\ninternational trade liberalization has made clear the need to\r\ncoordinate positions within the new international trade\r\nframework that emerged in the wake of the Uruguay\r\nRound.\r\nThe democratization process and changes in outside\r\ndevelopment strategies have been additional reasons for\r\nrevitalizing integration and regional growth.\r\nHowever, much remains to be done in terms of\r\nregional development. According to the conclusions of the\r\nFirst Regional Conference in Follow-up to the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, held in São Paolo, Brazil,\r\neconomic growth in the region has not been sufficient\r\nspeedily to overcome social problems, given the low rate of\r\nsavings and investment, a lack of dynamism in the job\r\nsector, marked social shortcomings and the existing gap\r\nbetween economic growth and the growth of the labour\r\nforce.\r\nThis outlook reaffirms the need to revitalize\r\nmechanisms for coordination and cooperation. SELA is an\r\nimportant tool to assist in effectively integrating the Latin\r\nAmerican region into the new realities of a broader market.\r\nMechanisms for political and economic coordination in our\r\nregion have developed in part thanks to existing cooperation\r\nmechanisms with the United Nations system, but it is clear\r\nthat civil society has also played an important role in\r\nregional integration. The participation of new players has\r\nincreased institutional involvement and given a new\r\ndynamism to the joint negotiating capacity of the countries\r\nwithin the system. Likewise, the involvement of non-State\r\nagents has encouraged our Governments to renew their\r\nefforts to support existing principles and mechanisms in\r\norder to achieve the objective of regional cooperation.\r\nWe must confront existing problems in a coordinated\r\nmanner at the subregional, regional and international levels.\r\nWhile it is the responsibility of the countries of the region\r\nthemselves to respond adequately to the new challenges\r\nposed by development, the advantages provided by close\r\ncooperation and collaboration between the region and the\r\nUnited Nations system will allow us to complement our\r\nregional approach with a universal one, and it will also give\r\nour countries alternative tools to help resolve the difficulties\r\nthat have arisen on the path towards sustainable economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nThat is why the commitments to participate actively,\r\nto provide concrete support to the countries of the region\r\nand to strengthen international cooperation mechanisms\r\nsuch as the anticipated cooperation between SELA and\r\nthe United Nations are complementary activities essential\r\nto the discharging of the mandate of SELA, which was\r\nestablished in Panama in 1975. Let us not forget to\r\nmention Venezuela, which has generously provided the\r\nheadquarters for this body and has had a decisive\r\ninfluence on matters relating to cooperation and to the\r\nfounding, transformative ideals of SELA.\r\nOn behalf of Argentina, I wish to express our strong\r\nsupport for the draft resolution submitted to the Assembly\r\nfor its consideration. We believe that it accurately reflects\r\nthe feeling in the region in terms of our future strategies\r\nfor inter-institutional cooperation between the United\r\nNations and SELA, and that it will respond to the\r\nchallenges of both growth and modernization in Latin\r\nAmerica.\r\nMr. Mungra (Suriname): I have the honour to\r\naddress this meeting on behalf of the 14 member States\r\nof the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) that are\r\nMembers of the United Nations: Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nthe Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti,\r\nJamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and\r\nthe Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago and my own\r\ncountry, Suriname.\r\nAllow me at the outset to extend our delegations’\r\nsincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive and informative report (A/52/376), in\r\nwhich he informs us of the various cooperation activities\r\nthat have been carried out between the Latin American\r\nEconomic System (SELA) and the United Nations system,\r\nin particular with the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), the World\r\nMeteorological Organization (WMO) and the World\r\nIntellectual Property Organization.\r\nConsidering the increased cooperation we have\r\nwitnessed during the past year in support of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean Member States in the field of\r\ndesigning policies on social development — including the\r\nfollow-up to the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment — on economic integration and on trends in\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nthe globalization process, our delegations are in favour of\r\na further broadening and deepening of the mutual\r\nsupporting activities between ECLAC and the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System, as expressed this morning by\r\nthe representative of Peru.\r\nDuring the general debate in the Second Committee,\r\nmany delegations expressed their concern at the threat of\r\nthe marginalization of many of the developing countries, in\r\nparticular the small and vulnerable States, as a consequence\r\nof the globalization process. In this regard, the small,\r\nfragile and vulnerable economies of CARICOM member\r\nStates should be given special attention by the United\r\nNations system. Existing regional development institutions\r\nshould be further strengthened in order to enhance their\r\ncapacity to assist individual Member States to adapt\r\nsuccessfully to the globalization process.\r\nIn its guidelines for action for the period 1997 to\r\n2000, the Latin American Economic System has defined its\r\nrole as an institution for promoting coordination and\r\ncooperation among its member States in pursuing the\r\nfollowing main objectives: to secure the timely and\r\nadequate participation of the 27 member countries of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean in the rapidly changing world\r\neconomy; to contribute to strengthening the regional\r\nintegration process, both among ourselves and with the\r\noutside world; and to enhance the global competitiveness of\r\nmember States.\r\nIn this regard, the organization intends to give priority\r\nto promoting exchanges of experiences among member\r\nStates, to the preparation by SELA of analytical and\r\ncomparative studies and to follow-up work on key global\r\neconomic issues with special attention to their regional and\r\nsubregional aspects.\r\nThe goals and responsibilities of SELA as just\r\nmentioned are comprehensive, while on the other hand its\r\nresources are regrettably limited. We are therefore pleased\r\nthat cooperation between those various United Nations\r\norganizations and SELA has allowed the institution to\r\nimplement its mandate more fully. We expect that this\r\nassistance will be deepened and broadened in the near\r\nfuture.\r\nThis year, for the first time in 22 years, the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System held a Council meeting in a\r\nCaribbean State, Trinidad and Tobago, thus expressing the\r\nwillingness of the organization to incorporate the interests\r\nof the Caribbean in a more assertive manner in the SELA\r\nwork programme. CARICOM is pleased with this\r\ndevelopment, since it will forge greater cooperation and\r\ncoordination among the developing countries in our\r\nregion. Further strengthening of the collaboration between\r\nSELA and the United Nations system will undoubtedly\r\nenhance this process.\r\nAgainst this background, I wish, on behalf of the\r\nStates members of CARICOM, to commend draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.6, introduced this morning by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Peru, for unanimous\r\nadoption.\r\nMr. Tanasescu (Romania) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is my honour to address the Assembly on\r\nagenda item 25, “Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Latin American Economic System”. It may seem\r\nsurprising that a country so distant from Latin America\r\nshould be speaking on such a specific item, but there are\r\nrational reasons for this.\r\nFirst of all, Romania is a Latin country. If we view\r\nLatin traits as a very important axis of cultural and\r\nspiritual diversity in the modern world, then we can see\r\nthat this axis has two ends: one in Eastern Europe — in\r\nRomania — and the other is in the very South of Latin\r\nAmerica. It is no mere happenstance that one of the first\r\nto explore Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego was the\r\nRomanian Iulio Popper, who visited those areas early in\r\nthis century and carried out scientific studies of nature\r\nthere.\r\nLinguistic and cultural affinities between my country\r\nand the countries of Latin America are an essential\r\nelement in the long-standing good relations between us.\r\nThat is why we follow with interest economic and\r\npolitical developments in the region, along with the role\r\nplayed by the Latin American Economic System (SELA)\r\nin promoting such developments.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe item before us and consider that it provides a good\r\nbasis for discussion. The report affirms that there is\r\nconvergence between the economic and social items of\r\ninterest to the United Nations and those of interest to\r\nSELA, which is an ongoing positive element in the\r\ndevelopment of the relationship between the two\r\norganizations. I stress the importance of the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean\r\n(ECLAC) in this cooperation with SELA, and a number\r\nof recent joint projects on matters of interest not only to\r\nLatin America but also to other regions: the definition of\r\neconomic and social policies, social aspects of regional\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nintegration and the role of human resources in the process\r\nof restructuring, to mention but a few.\r\nRecent developments in Latin America have confirmed\r\nthe growing importance of regional cooperation in current\r\nprocess of globalization. The Southern Cone Common\r\nMarket (MERCOSUR) in South America and the Central\r\nAmerican Integration System (SICA) in Central America\r\nhave in recent years strengthened their economic\r\ncooperation, showing that regional integration is a way for\r\nsmall and medium-sized countries to respond in a unified\r\nway to the challenges of globalization. Regional integration\r\nis a defining process of the world economy at the end of\r\nthe twentieth century, and the countries involved see it as\r\na tool for effective development as they strive for\r\nliberalization and for the opening up of their economies.\r\nRegional integration is a valid basis for promoting the\r\nintegration of national economies in an increasingly\r\ninterdependent and competitive economic world. As a\r\nframework for deliberation and cooperation among Latin\r\nAmerican countries, SELA has been the starting point for\r\nregional integration.\r\nIn our view, all these concepts, on which economic\r\nefforts and action in Latin America are based, possess a\r\nvalue that has been confirmed by the appearance of similar\r\nprocesses in other regions. The United Nations remains the\r\nsole universal forum where we can share our experiences\r\nin these processes and exchange ideas and views on the\r\nspecific needs of each region. We believe that this is one\r\nmore argument in favour of periodic discussion of this item\r\nin the General Assembly. By analyzing items relating to\r\nregional cooperation and integration, we can identify the\r\nimplications of these processes for the future structure of\r\ninternational relations and for the concepts that will define\r\nthe world in the coming century.\r\nIn the 1980s, Latin American countries began a broad\r\nprocess of internal political democratization, economic\r\nrestructuring and opening to the world. The results give rise\r\nto hope for developments on the international front.\r\nWithout these processes, our debate on this item would be\r\nless rich.\r\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, following the fall of\r\nthe Berlin Wall, similar processes began in Central and\r\nEastern Europe, including in my country. Our region now\r\nincludes more than 20 countries in various stages of the\r\nprocess of creating democratic institutions and legislation,\r\nalong with market-economy institutions and mechanisms.\r\nThere is great interest in formulating approaches to\r\ncooperation and regional integration.\r\nToday I wish to make a proposal to our Latin\r\nAmerican friends and to the representatives of SELA; it\r\nwas suggested by a distinguished Argentine academic\r\nduring the most recent meetings on the On-line\r\nInformation Key (LINK) project, held under United\r\nNations auspices in May. Here there is an opportunity to\r\nbegin an exchange of experiences and opinions between\r\nthe countries of Latin America and those of Central and\r\nEastern Europe on issues that are relevant to the processes\r\nthat both regions, at different times, have undertaken. The\r\nprocesses under way in both our regions could benefit\r\nfrom our sharing views on progress along the road to\r\ndemocratization, on institutions guaranteeing civil and\r\neconomic freedom and on the opening up of our\r\neconomies. With the support of ECLAC and of the\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe, SELA could provide\r\na framework for this exchange of experiences, and my\r\ncountry would participate in it with great interest.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution 35/3 of\r\n13 October 1980, I now call on the Observer for the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System.\r\nMr. Wagner (Latin American Economic System)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): I am pleased to express my\r\nthanks in particular to the delegation of Peru, which\r\nintroduced the draft resolution on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Latin American Economic System\r\n(SELA). I would also like to thank the delegations of the\r\nmember States of SELA and that of Romania for having\r\nsponsored this draft resolution, as well as delegations that\r\nhave spoken in favour of it. Of course, I have taken\r\ncareful note of the initiative suggested by the delegate of\r\nRomania on the interesting project for exchanging\r\nexperiences between Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nand the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. We will\r\ntake the necessary coordinating steps to carry it out.\r\nSince 1996 SELA has undergone a process of\r\nrestructuring and modernization, which is reflected\r\nprimarily in the reorientation of its work programme and\r\nthe updating of its modalities for action. The exchange of\r\nexperiences has been used as the principal mechanism for\r\npromoting regional coordination and cooperation.\r\nIn keeping with that reorientation, the activities of\r\nSELA are now focused on eight themes: an analysis of\r\nthe expected impact of the process of globalization on the\r\ninternational economy and on the development of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean; a follow-up to the relations\r\namong the countries of the region with their main\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\neconomic and trade partners; a consideration of trade issues\r\nin their regional, hemispheric and multilateral dimensions;\r\nfinancing development; support for reconciling the various\r\neconomic approaches to and agreements for integration in\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean; coordinating economic\r\nand social policies and strengthening small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises; technical cooperation among the countries\r\nof Latin America and the Caribbean within the framework\r\nof technical cooperation among developing countries; and\r\nactivities related to information dissemination, so that the\r\norganization’s work will reach the greatest number of actors\r\nwithin and outside the region.\r\nThese aspects are detailed further in the document\r\nentitled “A current vision of SELA”, which, at the request\r\nof the Latin American and Caribbean Group, I am pleased\r\nto make available to delegations.\r\nCooperation between SELA and the United Nations\r\nsystem is of particular importance in this context, given the\r\nconvergence and coordination of priorities set out at the\r\nregional level by the Latin American Council of SELA and\r\nthose of the international agenda, in particular the agenda\r\nof the United Nations and the bodies within its system.\r\nIn this respect, I am pleased to affirm that we have\r\ncontinued to strengthen the ties of coordination and joint\r\nwork of SELA with the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization, the United Nations Conference\r\non Trade and Development, the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the World Health\r\nOrganization, the International Labour Organization and the\r\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization, to mention only\r\nthe United Nations agencies with which we have the closest\r\nties.\r\nOf course, one of the characteristics of SELA is the\r\njoint and coordinated work it carries out with regional and\r\ninternational organizations so that we can avoid costly and\r\nneedless duplications.\r\nParticular mention should be made of the excellent\r\ncooperation that SELA has enjoyed over the years with the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme Special Unit for\r\nTechnical Cooperation among Developing Countries as a\r\nregional focal point for such technical cooperation among\r\nthe countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nExamples of this fruitful and close cooperation include the\r\nregional tasks of programming and negotiating technical\r\ncooperation among developing countries, such as that\r\ncarried out in 1995 for Haiti, which enabled us to create\r\nmore than 120 cooperation projects. Most of them to date\r\nhave been carried out with excellent results, such as the\r\nproject carried out in 1996 in support of small and\r\nmedium-sized enterprises in Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean and the one initiated in 1997 in support of\r\ndecentralization in Central America. A regional exercise\r\nfor greater cooperation between the Caribbean and Latin\r\nAmerica is scheduled for 1998, in Bridgetown, Barbados,\r\nand will bring together for the first time directors of\r\ninternational technical cooperation from the entire\r\nAmerican and Caribbean region in a Caribbean country.\r\nThe Permanent Secretariat of the Latin American\r\nEconomic System trusts that this cooperation will be\r\nstrengthened and broadened in order to support the\r\ncountries of Latin America and the Caribbean in our\r\nefforts to respond positively to the challenges of the\r\nglobalization of the international economy and of\r\nachieving development with social equity.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe have now heard the last speaker in the debate on this\r\nitem.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.6.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly wishes to\r\nadopt the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/52/L.6?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.6 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/3).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in explanation of position on the resolution just\r\nadopted. May I remind delegations that explanations of\r\nposition are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Baltes (Luxembourg): The European Union\r\njoined the consensus on draft resolution A/52/L.6, on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System, but at the same time we\r\nwould like to put on record the following observations.\r\nRegarding operative paragraph 3, we note that the\r\ndraft resolution urges the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) to renew and expand its financial\r\nand technical cooperation with the relevant programmes.\r\nIt is the European Union’s understanding that decisions\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\non such activities are up to the UNDP Executive Board in\r\nthe context of UNDP’s agreed priorities and budget.\r\nRegarding operative paragraph 4, the European Union\r\nalso notes that the resolution adds funds of the United\r\nNations system to the list of bodies which are urged to\r\ncontinue and intensify their support for and cooperation in\r\nthe activities of SELA. We would have liked some further\r\nclarification on the intention of this addition.\r\nAlso, the European Union would have welcomed the\r\nopportunity for informal consultations on the draft\r\nresolution before it came to the plenary.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe have heard the only speaker in explanation of position.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 25?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 31\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/377)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.2)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Indonesia to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.2.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): In its capacity as the\r\nChairman of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers,\r\nIndonesia has the distinct honour and privilege of\r\nintroducing, on behalf of the 55 States members of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference”, which is\r\ncontained in document A/52/L.2 of 15 October 1997.\r\nBefore proceeding, however, we would like to express\r\nour deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for the\r\ncomprehensive and informative report (A/52/377) he has\r\npresented under this agenda item on the state of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference.\r\nEarlier this month, on the occasion of the annual\r\ncoordination meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the OIC,\r\nheld at United Nations Headquarters, Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan stated that the OIC and the United Nations\r\nwere natural partners in the cause of peace and prosperity.\r\nOn the same occasion, Mr. Ali Alatas, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and\r\nChairman of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers,\r\nreferred to the tremendous stake the OIC had in the\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations through judicious\r\nreform and democratization, and stated that much of the\r\nadvocacy and many of the initiatives that members of the\r\nOIC were pursuing would prosper or fade in the forums\r\nof the United Nations system.\r\nIndeed, ever since its inception the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference has been steadfast in its\r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter. Over the years, we have witnessed\r\nexpanded cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOIC with a view to achieving the common objectives of\r\nthe preservation of peace and security and the promotion\r\nof social and economic development.\r\nThe draft resolution which I have the honour to\r\nintroduce today not only reflects the many tangible forms\r\nof cooperation which have been established between the\r\ntwo Organizations, but is also aimed at further enhancing\r\nsuch cooperation. The draft is essentially identical to the\r\nresolutions adopted under the same agenda item at earlier\r\nsessions of the General Assembly.\r\nThe preamble of the draft resolution takes into\r\naccount the desire of both Organizations to continue to\r\ncooperate closely in their common search for solutions to\r\nglobal problems. It recalls the Articles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations that encourage the activities through\r\nregional cooperation for the promotion of the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations. It notes the\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United Nations,\r\nits funds and programmes and specialized agencies and\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, its subsidiary\r\norgans and its specialized and affiliated institutions. Also,\r\nit notes the encouraging progress made in the nine\r\npriority areas of cooperation, as well as in the\r\nidentification of other areas of cooperation. Furthermore,\r\nit recognizes that the strengthening of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and other organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations system and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference and other organs and institutions of\r\nthe OIC system contributes to the promotion of the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. It takes\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\ninto account the report (A/47/277) of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled “An Agenda for Peace”, in particular section VII,\r\nconcerning cooperation with regional arrangements and\r\norganizations, and the “Supplement to An Agenda for\r\nPeace” (A/50/60). Finally, with respect to the preamble, it\r\nnotes with appreciation the determination of both\r\nOrganizations to strengthen further the existing cooperation\r\nby developing specific proposals in the designated priority\r\nareas of cooperation, as well as in the political field.\r\nIn its operative paragraphs, the General Assembly\r\nwould, inter alia, note with satisfaction the active\r\nparticipation of the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nin the work of the United Nations towards the realization of\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. The General Assembly would also request the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference to continue cooperation in their common search\r\nfor solutions to global problems. In addition, the General\r\nAssembly would welcome the efforts of the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference to\r\nstrengthen cooperation between them in areas of common\r\nconcern and to review the ways and means for enhancing\r\nthe actual mechanisms of such cooperation. The Assembly\r\nwould also welcome the efforts of the secretariats of the\r\ntwo Organizations to strengthen information exchange,\r\ncoordination and cooperation between them in areas of\r\nmutual interest in the political field, and their ongoing\r\nconsultations with a view to developing the modalities of\r\nsuch cooperation. It would further welcome the periodic\r\nhigh-level meetings between the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, as well as between\r\nsenior secretariat officials of the two Organizations, and\r\nencourage their participation in important meetings of the\r\ntwo Organizations.\r\nThe draft resolution would recommend that, in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 50/17, in\r\norder to enhance cooperation and for the purpose of review\r\nand appraisal of progress, a general meeting between\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretariats of the United Nations\r\nsystem and the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nshould take place in 1998. It would also recommend that,\r\nagain in accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n50/17, coordination meetings of focal points of the\r\norganizations and agencies of the United Nations system\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its\r\nspecialized institutions should be held concurrently with the\r\ngeneral meeting in 1998. The draft resolution would\r\nencourage the specialized agencies and other organizations\r\nof the United Nations system to continue to expand their\r\ncooperation with the subsidiary organs and specialized\r\nand affiliated institutions of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, particularly by negotiating\r\ncooperation agreements, and would invite them to\r\nmultiply the contacts and meetings of the focal points for\r\ncooperation in priority areas of interest to the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nIt would urge the United Nations and other organizations\r\nof the United Nations system, especially the lead\r\nagencies, to provide increased technical and other forms\r\nof assistance to the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and\r\naffiliated institutions in order to enhance cooperation.\r\nThe General Assembly would express its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued\r\nefforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween the United Nations and other organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations system and the OIC and its subsidiary\r\norgans and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve\r\nthe mutual interests of the two Organizations in the\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural fields; and would\r\nexpress the hope that the Secretary-General will continue\r\nto strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the\r\ntwo Organizations.\r\nThe Assembly would request the Secretary-General\r\nto report to it at its fifty-third session on the state of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Finally, the\r\nAssembly would decide to include in the provisional\r\nagenda of its fifty-third session the item entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference”.\r\nOn behalf of the member States of the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference, I should like to request the\r\nMembers of the Assembly to support the draft resolution\r\nand, as has been the case in previous years, to facilitate\r\nits adoption by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution 3369\r\n(XXX), of 10 October 1975, I now call on the observer\r\nfor the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nMr. Ansay (Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference): It is my privilege to address the General\r\nAssembly this morning on behalf of the Secretary-General\r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Mr.\r\nLaraki, on agenda item 31, which covers the status of\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nI would take this opportunity, at the outset, to\r\ncongratulate the President and his colleagues in the Bureau\r\non their election to their high offices. I know that in the\r\nPresident’s capable hands the work of the Assembly will be\r\nvery ably directed. I also join other delegations in paying\r\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Razali Ismail, and his\r\ncolleagues on the outgoing Bureau, for steering the work of\r\nthe Assembly with remarkable success during its fifty-first\r\nsession.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General, which is before\r\nus in document A/52/377, provides informative material on\r\nthe activities of cooperation between our two Organizations\r\nand their respective subsidiary and specialized organs,\r\nagencies and institutions in areas of common concern in\r\n1997. It describes the endeavours of the United Nations\r\nsystem in implementing General Assembly resolution 51/18\r\nof 14 November 1996, which requested the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue\r\ncooperation in their common search for solutions to global\r\nproblems relating to international peace and security,\r\ndisarmament, self-determination, fundamental human rights,\r\nsocial and economic development and technical\r\ncooperation, as well as to continue to expand the\r\nparameters of this cooperation in response to the growing\r\nneeds of our common member States. I would, therefore,\r\ntake the opportunity to extend to the President and the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the Executive\r\nHeads of the various United Nations funds, programmes\r\nand specialized agencies, our sincere thanks for their and\r\ntheir respective staffs’ efforts, which have kept our common\r\nendeavours in full motion throughout the year.\r\nRepresentatives will recall that General Assembly\r\nresolution 50/17 of 20 November 1995 called for\r\nstrengthening cooperation between our two Organizations\r\nin the political field, besides, of course, continuing to\r\nexpand our ongoing cooperation in several economic, social\r\nand humanitarian sectors. As the Secretary-General’s report\r\nillustrates, this aspect has figured prominently in the two\r\nmeetings between the Secretaries-General of our two\r\nOrganizations, held here at the United Nations on 2 May\r\n1997 and 4 October 1997, and in the high-level meeting of\r\nofficials of the two Organizations held here also on 4\r\nOctober 1997. This meeting of senior officials preceded the\r\nmeeting between the Secretaries-General of our two\r\nOrganizations which I have just mentioned.\r\nThese meetings devoted particular attention to\r\nongoing peacemaking efforts in Palestine, Afghanistan,\r\nJammu and Kashmir and Tajikistan, as well as\r\npeacekeeping efforts relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nAzerbaijan, Somalia and Cyprus. I would cite two\r\nexamples of our cooperation at the practical level during\r\nthe period under review: first, the workings of our\r\nrespective missions in Afghanistan, which have\r\nmaintained complementarity and close contact in assisting\r\nthe various Afghan political factions in finding an\r\nagreeable solution to their present predicament; secondly,\r\nthe joint support of the United Nations and the OIC\r\nextended to the inter-Tajik talks, which led to the signing\r\nof the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace\r\nand National Concord in Tajikistan between the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Tajikistan and the United\r\nTajik Opposition, in Moscow on 27 June 1997. On the\r\nsame occasion, the Secretary-General of the OIC\r\nco-signed the Protocol on Guarantees along with the\r\nrepresentatives of the United Nations, other observer\r\nStates and organizations to support the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to ensure the implementation of\r\nthe peace agreements.\r\nI am glad to report that our cooperation in the social,\r\neconomic and cultural spheres has proceeded as planned\r\nduring the period under review. It is focusing on the nine\r\npriority areas that have been identified among our two\r\nOrganizations, namely, the development of science and\r\ntechnology; trade and development; technical cooperation\r\namong Islamic countries; assistance to refugees; food\r\nsecurity and agriculture; education and the eradication of\r\nilliteracy; investment mechanisms and joint ventures;\r\nhuman resource development; and the environment.\r\nThe adoption of new cost-effective modalities\r\nstemming from the recommendations of the meeting of\r\nUnited Nations and OIC focal points, held in Geneva in\r\nJune 1995, which were endorsed by the general meeting\r\nbetween the secretariats of the two organizations, held in\r\nGeneva in June 1996, is accelerating the programme and\r\nproject identification, approval and implementation\r\nprocesses. I would cite briefly two recent examples of\r\nthese endeavours: first, the technical assistance that the\r\nOIC and the United Nations Development Programme are\r\nproviding to the Foundation for Social Peace, a respected\r\nAfrican non-governmental organization based in Niamey,\r\nNiger, in implementing its Rural Education and\r\nAgricultural Extension facility for the nomads of the\r\nSahel and Sahara regions, with some catalytic financial\r\nsupport from the Perez Guerrero Trust Fund; secondly,\r\nthe technical assistance being extended by the Islamic\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nChamber of Commerce and Industry and the UNDP’s\r\nSpecial Unit for Technical Cooperation Among Developing\r\nCountries to the small and medium-scale industries\r\nconcerned with food processing and textiles in the Arab and\r\nAfrican regions. In both instances, speedy project\r\nidentification and approval processes reflecting effective\r\ncoordination between the two Organizations at the working\r\nlevels are now accelerating the delivery and\r\nimplementation, to the advantage of the beneficiaries.\r\nI should now like to refer briefly to the annual\r\ncoordination meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs\r\nof the States members of the OIC, held on 2 October 1997,\r\nto discuss the agenda of the fifty-second session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in particular those items that were of\r\nrelevance to the member States of the OIC. I am happy to\r\nrecall that the meeting was, unprecedentedly, addressed by\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations. As the\r\nSecretary-General’s report mentions in paragraph 2, in\r\nresponse to our invitation, a senior representative from the\r\nUnited Nations Department of Political Affairs also\r\nattended the meeting and observed its deliberations.\r\nParagraph 3 of the report of the Secretary-General\r\nsummarizes the issues that the meeting covered.\r\nThe Ambassador of Indonesia, acting in his capacity\r\nas Chairman of the Islamic Group and the representative of\r\nthe current Chairman of the Islamic Conference of Foreign\r\nMinisters, has graciously introduced, with detailed\r\neloquence, the draft resolution on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference which is before the Assembly in document\r\nA/52/L.2 of 15 October 1997. I would take the liberty of\r\ndrawing attention to 4 of the 13 operative paragraphs,\r\nbecause of their significance.\r\nFirst, paragraphs 7 and 8 recommend the convening of\r\na general meeting and of coordination meetings of focal\r\npoints of the organizations and agencies of the United\r\nNations system and of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference and its specialized institutions in Geneva,\r\nconcurrently, in 1998. We believe that the convening of the\r\ntwo meetings in the same time-frame, unlike the practice in\r\nprevious years, will be an efficient and economical way of\r\npursuing the objective of coordination between our two\r\nOrganizations in areas of common interest.\r\nSecondly, paragraph 9 encourages, among other things,\r\nthe specialized agencies and other organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations system to negotiate cooperation agreements\r\nwith their OIC counterparts for cooperation in priority areas\r\nof interest to the two Organizations. Two memoranda of\r\nunderstanding signed by the Islamic Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) with the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) here in New\r\nYork last year, and one with the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) this year, have paved\r\nthe way for ISESCO’s systematic consultation and\r\neffective cooperation with these three major programmes\r\nof the United Nations, adding to several it has similarly\r\nconcluded with other United Nations organizations in the\r\npast. We would hope that this process will continue to\r\nexpand between the relevant organs, agencies and\r\ninstitutions of our two Organizations.\r\nThirdly, paragraph 10 urges the United Nations and\r\nother organizations of the United Nations system,\r\nespecially the lead agencies, to provide increased\r\ntechnical and other forms of assistance to the OIC and its\r\nsubsidiary and specialized organs and affiliated\r\ninstitutions, in order to enhance cooperation. At a time\r\nwhen the OIC is initiating a four-year action programme\r\nof economic and technical cooperation between its\r\nmember States, it would welcome such assistance, which\r\nshould go a long way in reinforcing and strengthening its\r\ninstitutional capacity for the operational challenges it will\r\nbe facing in the process. This aspect was favourably\r\napproached in the discussions held between the\r\nSecretaries-General of the two Organizations when they\r\nlast met here earlier this month.\r\nAs with the resolution of the preceding year, none of\r\nthe operative paragraphs contained in this resolution\r\ninvolves any additional financial implications. I am\r\ntherefore confident that it will attract unanimous approval.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the OIC\r\nderives its inspiration and guidance from the teachings of\r\nIslam, the religion of peace, which advocates justice,\r\nequality, tolerance and cooperation between all nations\r\nand all segments of mankind. These noble tenets shall\r\ncontinue to guide our cooperation with the United Nations\r\nas we pursue our journey towards the global village of the\r\ntwenty-first century, in quest of peace, prosperity and\r\nprogress for all mankind.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker on this item. The General\r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.2.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.2 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/4).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMay I also take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 31?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 33\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the League\r\nof Arab States\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/378)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.3 and Corr.1)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Yemen to introduce\r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nMr. Al-Ashtal (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIn my capacity as Chairman of the Arab Group for this\r\nmonth, I have the honour to introduce, on behalf of the\r\nmember States of the League of Arab States, the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/52/L.3, under agenda\r\nitem 33, “Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States”.\r\nThe existing bonds between the United Nations and\r\nthe League of Arab States were reinforced following the\r\nadoption by the General Assembly of resolution 48/21 on\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the League\r\nof Arab States”. That resolution, adopted by consensus,\r\nembodies the cooperation sought under Chapter VIII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations.\r\nAs demonstrated by their common history, the\r\nrelationship between the two Organizations has been\r\npremised on the principles and purposes enshrined in their\r\nrespective charters. These charters aim at the same\r\nobjective, namely, maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity being in the forefront of their interests.\r\nIn view of the fact that the peace process in the\r\nMiddle East is currently stalling because of genuine\r\ndifficulties and obstacles that may jeopardize peace and\r\nsecurity in the region, there is a dire need for further\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the League of\r\nArab States, in order to contribute to the creation of a\r\nmore favourable atmosphere in which the peace process\r\nin the Middle East will lead to a comprehensive, lasting\r\nand just peace ensuring the legitimate rights of all parties\r\nconcerned, so that the Palestinian people can exercise all\r\nits legitimate rights on the totality of its national territory,\r\nincluding Jerusalem.\r\nIn the same context, there is a pressing need to\r\nintensify cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States in economic, social and\r\ndevelopment areas so that the economic and financial\r\nresources available may be used in a more coordinated\r\nand efficient manner in pursuit of the common interests\r\nof the two organizations.\r\nThe preambular portion of the draft resolution before\r\nus contains paragraphs that underscore the desire of the\r\ntwo organizations to consolidate the ties existing between\r\nthem in all spheres, and to continue their cooperation,\r\nthereby promoting the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn the operative paragraphs of the draft resolution,\r\nthe Assembly, inter alia, expresses appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the follow-up action he has taken to\r\nimplement the proposals adopted at the meetings between\r\nthe representatives of the secretariats of the United\r\nNations and other organizations of the United Nations\r\nsystem dealing with development and the General\r\nSecretariat of the League of Arab States and its\r\nspecialized organizations, including the latest meeting\r\nheld in Geneva in 1997.\r\nParagraph 11 calls for a general meeting to take\r\nplace every two years between the United Nations system\r\nand the League of Arab States. It also calls for inter-\r\nagency sectoral meetings to be organized regularly on\r\nareas of priority and wide importance in the development\r\nof the Arab States, on the basis of agreement between the\r\ncounterpart programmes of the United Nations system and\r\nthe League of Arab States and its specialized\r\norganizations.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of Arab States, I invite all\r\nmembers of the international community to support the\r\nLeague of Arab States and its efforts to cooperate with\r\nthe United Nations system in the service of their common\r\ngoals, as set forth in the text of the draft resolution now\r\nbefore the Assembly. This draft resolution merits adoption\r\nby consensus.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution 477 (V) of\r\n1 November 1950, I now call on the Observer of the\r\nLeague of Arab States.\r\nMr. Hassouna (League of Arab States): Allow me at\r\nthe outset to express to the President my sincere\r\ncongratulations on his election to preside over the United\r\nNations General Assembly at its fifty-second session. His\r\nelection to that lofty post attests to the confidence and high\r\nesteem that the international community feels for his\r\ncountry, Ukraine.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States is nothing new. It began in the\r\n1940s, when the founding States of the League of Arab\r\nStates participated in drawing up the United Nations\r\nCharter at the San Francisco Conference, thereby\r\ncontributing to enshrining in the Charter the principle of\r\nregional organizations. That principle led to the creation on\r\n22 March 1945 of the League of Arab States, the first\r\nregional organization to emerge in the international order\r\nfollowing the end of the Second World War.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States has evolved gradually over time. Its\r\nfirst stage began in 1950, when the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General, at the request of the General Assembly,\r\ninvited the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States\r\nto attend the session of the Assembly as an observer, and\r\ncontinued until 1981, when the General Assembly invited\r\nthe League of Arab States to participate officially as an\r\nObserver in the sessions and work of the Assembly and its\r\nsubsidiary bodies.\r\nThe first contractual relationship between the two\r\norganizations, in the sphere of cooperation, was set forth in\r\na memorandum of agreement that was ratified by both\r\norganizations in 1960. Subsequently, the two organizations\r\ndetermined to strengthen their cooperation, in keeping with\r\nan agreement between the two organizations that was\r\nratified in 1989.\r\nOver the years, cooperation between the two\r\norganizations has evolved and now includes several\r\nagreements between the League of Arab States and the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, establishing\r\ncooperation in joint programmes and projects in the\r\ninterests of the Arab region.\r\nIn his report (A/52/378) of 23 September 1997, the\r\nSecretary-General indicates that the Secretaries-General of\r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States have in\r\nrecent times continued their practice of meetings and\r\nconsultations. The Secretary-General of the League of\r\nArab States held important consultations at United\r\nNations Headquarters with Mr. Kofi Annan on two\r\noccasions, in June and October of this year. The\r\nSecretaries-General discussed the various questions before\r\nthe United Nations of concern to Arab countries and\r\nconsidered ways to strengthen coordination and\r\ncooperation between the two organizations. We hope soon\r\nto welcome the United Nations Secretary-General at the\r\nHeadquarters of the League of Arab States in Cairo to\r\ncontinue the discussion of the various questions of interest\r\nto both organizations.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States was broadened during the course\r\nof a successful joint meeting between the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and the League of Arab\r\nStates and its institutions at Geneva in July 1997, as a\r\nfollow-up to earlier joint meetings between the two\r\norganizations held at Geneva in 1993 and Vienna in 1995.\r\nThe agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of\r\nboth organizations in such international and regional\r\nquestions as the political question of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security or humanitarian questions\r\nsuch as mine clearance, as well as other questions dealing\r\nwith economic and social cooperation, sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the environment, combating drugs, crime\r\nprevention, agricultural and rural development, family\r\nplanning, population and health. All those subjects are\r\nboth regional and international in scope and are dealt with\r\nby the United Nations and the League of Arab States in\r\nthe framework of the active cooperation that they enjoy.\r\nThe positive nature of this cooperation is best\r\nreflected in the conclusions reached by the participants in\r\nthat meeting as a result of their evaluation of the\r\nachievements realized to date, which demonstrate the need\r\nto pursue the cooperation between the two organizations\r\nto foster international peace and security and strengthen\r\nsocial and economic development in the region.\r\nIn this respect, I wish to share the view of the\r\nparticipants on the importance of pursuing the joint\r\npolitical efforts of the two organizations in the settlement\r\nof regional disputes and crises. I would add here that\r\nthese efforts should be based on what is currently being\r\ndone to settle the crisis in Somalia, given that the two\r\norganizations are participating in Somalia’s national\r\nreconciliation process with a view to restoring security to\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nthat country. The participants also felt that it is necessary\r\nto continue studying the question of strengthening the role\r\nof the League of Arab States and its ability to contribute to\r\nthe areas of preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping in\r\naccordance with Chapter VIII of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nIn the area of disarmament, the participants supported\r\nthe efforts of the League of Arab States in drafting an\r\nagreement to make the Middle East a zone free of all\r\nweapons of mass destruction and encouraged the two\r\norganizations to step up their efforts to proclaim it so. They\r\nalso emphasized the need to make the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) universal through\r\nthe accession of all countries. In this respect, the\r\nparticipants noted the accession of all Arab States to the\r\nTreaty.\r\nIn addition, they expressed their concern over the\r\ncontinuing problem of landmines, which cause great human\r\nsuffering. We should therefore intensify international efforts\r\nto solve this problem. There is no doubt that the recent\r\nOslo agreement to ban anti-personnel landmines represents\r\nan important step towards this goal.\r\nOne of the major results of the Geneva meeting was\r\nthe joint agreement of the two organizations on holding a\r\nsectoral meeting on international trade and development at\r\nthe headquarters of the League of Arab States in Cairo in\r\n1998. This is a priority area for achieving progress and for\r\neconomic and social development in the Arab region. In\r\nthis respect, I should like, on behalf of the League of Arab\r\nStates, to thank the Secretariat of the United Nations for its\r\ntireless efforts to convene joint meetings between the two\r\norganizations and to strengthen cooperation between them\r\nin all areas.\r\nThe current international order is seeing major changes\r\nin regional and international relations. This highlights the\r\nincreased importance of the United Nations and its crucial\r\nrole in maintaining international peace and security. Aware\r\nof this reality, the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nhas set forth his reform programme for the Organization,\r\nwhich includes a set of measures and proposals aimed at\r\nachieving this goal. The League of Arab States expresses its\r\nsupport for the Secretary-General and its appreciation for\r\nhis initiative, which is aimed at improving the\r\nOrganization’s performance and strengthening its role.\r\nI would also stress the content of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the programme of reform, which\r\naffirms the will of the United Nations to increase\r\ncooperation with regional organizations so as to make\r\nthem ever more active partners with the Organization in\r\nall activities related to peacekeeping and international\r\nsecurity, including conflict prevention. The League of\r\nArab States stands ready to cooperate with the United\r\nNations in this context, particularly in the light of the\r\nLeague’s recent efforts to improve its mechanisms and to\r\ncreate new political and legal bodies for settling regional\r\nconflicts, such as the Arab court of justice and its own\r\nmechanisms for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution.\r\nIn the context of its attachment to the establishment\r\nof a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in our region,\r\nand on the basis of the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter and international resolutions, the Council of\r\nForeign Ministers of the League of Arab States, at its\r\n108th regular meeting in September, reiterated the\r\ncommitment of League members to the two essential\r\nprinciples relating to their position on recent\r\ndevelopments in the peace process.\r\nFirst, we attach importance to the achievement of a\r\njust and comprehensive peace as a strategic goal on the\r\nbasis of the principles of the peace process — the most\r\nimportant of which is the implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\r\n(1978) — as well as the principle of land for peace and\r\nthe implementation of the legitimate political rights of the\r\nPalestinian people, including its rights to self-\r\ndetermination and the establishment of an independent\r\nState.\r\nSecondly, we reject the policies of the Israeli\r\nGovernment aimed at undermining the peace process and\r\nits repudiation of the principles and bases of that process.\r\nWe also reject its refusal to implement the commitments\r\nand agreements undertaken in the course of the peace\r\nprocess; its unilateral measures aimed at imposing a fait\r\naccompli in Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Golan; and\r\nits aggressions in southern Lebanon. We hold the Israeli\r\nGovernment fully responsible for the consequences of its\r\npolicies and positions, which have set back the peace\r\nprocess and thrown into question the measures taken in\r\nrespect of Israel in the framework of the peace process.\r\nGiven the dangers facing our region and the\r\nescalation resulting from the continuing policies and\r\npractices of the Israeli Government, the League of Arab\r\nStates asks the international community, represented by\r\nthe United Nations, to assume its responsibilities and role\r\nin relaunching the peace process, following all negotiating\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\noptions and implementing the Organization’s resolutions of\r\ninternational legality on the question of Palestine and the\r\nMiddle East, which is a legal, political and moral\r\nobligation. In our view, this is the only guarantee of peace\r\nand security for the peoples of the region.\r\nIn conclusion, I would affirm the continued and\r\nunequivocal support of the League of Arab States for the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\nwish the Organization every success in its tasks. May it\r\nmeet the challenges it faces in our world today, where our\r\ntwo organizations are striving to establish respect for the\r\nvalues, principles and laws governing actions between\r\ncountries and peoples.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.3 and Corr.1. May I take it that the\r\nAssembly decides to adopt the draft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.3 and Corr.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 52/5).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on the representative of Israel, who wishes to\r\nexplain his position on the resolution just adopted. May I\r\nremind him that explanations of vote or position are limited\r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Gilon (Israel): The delegation of Israel has joined\r\nthe consensus on this resolution for the fourth time in a\r\nrow. In so doing, we are guided by the desire to make\r\npeace with our neighbours, all of which are members of the\r\nLeague of Arab States.\r\nToday, after a long period of standstill in the peace\r\nprocess, there is new hope for progress on the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian track. The nine joint committees have resumed\r\ntheir work after a meeting between Prime Minister\r\nNetanyahu and Chairman Arafat and between Foreign\r\nMinister Levy and Mr. Abu Mazin. Further discussions are\r\nexpected later this month in Washington.\r\nWe still hope for positive developments on the Syrian-\r\nLebanese track. It is regrettable that at the meeting of the\r\nForeign Ministers of the Arab League held in Cairo, a one-\r\nsided approach was adopted, and only Israel was blamed\r\nfor the problems which have at times arisen in the peace\r\nprocess. The Arab League Foreign Ministers called for,\r\ninter alia, stopping the normalization process between\r\nIsrael and its Arab neighbours, abjuring Arab participation\r\non multilateral tracks, adhering to the Arab boycott\r\nagainst Israel and more.\r\nThe peace process which began in Madrid in 1991\r\nwas based on two tracks: the bilateral tracks between\r\nIsrael and its neighbours, and multilateral tracks between\r\nIsrael and the entire Arab world. Freezing one track of\r\nthe peace process contributes nothing to the advancement\r\nof the other track.\r\nDespite our concerns, we also note that the Ministers\r\nfor Foreign Affairs have at the same time emphasized\r\ntheir commitment to peace. We hope that now, when\r\nthere are new prospects for the peace process, they will\r\nstand by their commitments and choose a constructive\r\nrole in advancing peace in our region.\r\nIsrael supports cooperation between the United\r\nNations and various regional organizations, including the\r\nLeague of Arab States. Moreover, Israel does not seek to\r\nreplace the current regional system of States with a new\r\norganizational structure in the Middle East. Indeed, the\r\ncooperation between the League of Arab States and the\r\nUnited Nations is based on provisions of the United\r\nNations Charter. In this context, it is regrettable that Israel\r\nstill does not belong to a regional political group —\r\nwhich its geographical location would warrant — at the\r\nUnited Nations due to the political objections of some\r\nMember States.\r\nIsrael calls upon the members of the League of Arab\r\nStates to lift their objection to the admission of Israel to\r\nthe Asian Group. The fact that Israel is currently denied\r\nmembership in any regional political group directly\r\ncontradicts the basic principle of the universality of the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as the principle of sovereign\r\nequality.\r\nIsrael takes this opportunity to call for increased\r\ncooperation between the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the League of Arab States for the\r\nestablishment of joint projects within the framework of\r\nregional agricultural development in the areas under the\r\njurisdiction of the Palestinian Council.\r\nIsrael feels that the Arab world should provide a\r\ngreater share of aid to the Palestinian Council to match\r\nthe aid given by the European Union, Norway, Japan and\r\nthe United States.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nIsrael welcomes all efforts to advance the social,\r\neconomic, education, health and cultural standing of\r\nPalestinian residents of the territories, within the framework\r\nof participation between the League of Arab States and\r\nUnited Nations agencies.\r\nThis is the first resolution on an issue related to the\r\nMiddle East to be adopted by the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-second session. We are pleased that the resolution was\r\nadopted by consensus. We would therefore take this\r\nopportunity to recommend that all parties to the peace\r\nprocess exercise restraint in both the language of draft\r\nresolutions to be submitted, as well as with regard to their\r\nstated purposes.\r\nWe cannot build confidence in the Middle East by\r\nengaging in political battle in New York. The peace process\r\nis by its nature bilateral, between the parties. Inflammatory\r\nrhetoric offered in international forums surely belongs to\r\nanother era.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe have heard the only speaker in explanation of position.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 33?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 158\r\nObserver status for the Andean Community in the\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.5)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI call on the representative of Ecuador to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.5.\r\nMr. Camacho (Ecuador) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): On behalf of the sponsors, I have the honour to\r\nintroduce the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/52/L.5, entitled “Observer status for the Andean\r\nCommunity in the General Assembly”.\r\nThe member countries of the Andean Community\r\nshare particularly close social, cultural and historical ties.\r\nThey became independent through a common effort headed\r\nby Simón Bolívar.\r\nFollowing a century and a half of independence, the\r\nplenipotentiaries of Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and\r\nPeru signed the Subregional Integration Agreement on 26\r\nMay 1969, Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Venezuela\r\nsigned the Agreement in 1973, and in 1976 Chile\r\nwithdrew from it, leaving the five States that today make\r\nup the Andean Community.\r\nThe process of integration continued to develop: in\r\nOctober 1992 the Andean Free Trade Area was\r\nestablished; in 1995 the Andean Customs Union was\r\nestablished when the Common External Tariff came into\r\nforce. Finally, at the seventh Andean Presidential Council,\r\nheld at Quito, Ecuador, on 5 September 1995, the five\r\ncountries decided to reorganize the executive and\r\nadministrative bodies of the system to create the Andean\r\nIntegration System — the Andean Community we know\r\ntoday.\r\nAs a result of that reorganization, the six principal\r\nbodies of the Andean Integration System were set up: the\r\nAndean Presidential Council, the highest body of the\r\nSystem, which is composed of the Heads of State of the\r\nmember countries and which meets annually; the Andean\r\nCouncil of Ministers for Foreign Affairs; the Commission\r\nof the Andean Community; the General Secretariat, as the\r\npermanent executive body, with its headquarters in Lima,\r\nPeru, and headed by the Secretary-General; the Andean\r\nCommunity Court of Justice, with its headquarters in\r\nQuito, Ecuador; and the Andean Parliament, whose\r\nheadquarters will be in Bogotá, Colombia.\r\nThe main objectives of the Andean Community are\r\nto promote the balanced and harmonious development of\r\nthe member countries on an equal basis through\r\nintegration and economic and social cooperation; to\r\naccelerate economic and social growth and generate\r\nemployment; to reduce vulnerability to external factors\r\nand to improve the position of member countries in the\r\nglobal economic context; and to strengthen subregional\r\nsolidarity and reduce differences in existing levels of\r\ndevelopment among its members.\r\nOn behalf of the member States of the Andean\r\nCommunity, I would like to express our gratitude to the\r\nmembers of other systems of integration, such as the\r\nEuropean Union, the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR), the Central American Integration System\r\nand the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), all of which\r\ngenerously offered to sponsor the draft resolution that I\r\nam introducing to the Assembly. We are also grateful for\r\nthe sponsorship of the United States of America.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nThe Andean Community attaches great importance to\r\nits relations with other integration systems. These past few\r\ndays, the President of Ecuador, Dr. Fabián Alarcón, the\r\ncurrent Chairman of the Andean Presidential Council,\r\naccompanied by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the\r\ncountries of the Community, has been visiting Brussels in\r\norder to strengthen ties between the European Union and\r\nthe Andean Community.\r\nSimilarly, the Andean Community is involved in\r\nnegotiations with MERCOSUR with the aim of establishing\r\na free-trade zone between the two groups within 10 years.\r\nTo the same end, negotiations are also under way with\r\nPanama and CARICOM, and discussions are foreseen with\r\nthe Central American Integration System in the future.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to point out that Canada,\r\nCyprus, France and the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia have joined the 35 sponsors which appear in\r\ndocument A/52/L.5. We hope that the General Assembly\r\nwill welcome this draft resolution and give it its unanimous\r\nsupport.\r\nMr. Escovar-Salom (Venezuela) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The delegation of Venezuela is very pleased to\r\njoin in sponsoring this draft resolution aimed at granting\r\nobserver status to the Andean Community in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Andean Community has enabled its member\r\ncountries — Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and\r\nVenezuela — to promote balanced harmonious and\r\nequitable development through economic and social\r\nintegration.\r\nFor example, we have established a free-trade area,\r\nwithout tariff or para-tariff restrictions, and we are\r\nnegotiating with the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\nto extend that zone over the next 10 years. Similarly, we\r\nhave signed new cooperation agreements with the European\r\nUnion in order to promote the flow of investment and the\r\ntransfer of technology.\r\nThis dynamism imparted by the Andean Community\r\nto our economies has enabled us to create sources of stable\r\nand productive employment and to fight effectively against\r\npoverty, marginalization and the other forms of suffering\r\nthat still affect a considerable portion of our population.\r\nThe purpose of the Andean Community is to improve\r\nthe standard of living of the inhabitants of the subregion.\r\nObserver status at the United Nations would facilitate the\r\nrealization of this mission. Venezuela is open to relations\r\nwith the rest of the world. We view globalization as a\r\nfundamental trend of the times and of the coming century.\r\nBut to achieve globalization many roads will have to be\r\ncrossed, and there are many means of crossing them.\r\nTherefore, Venezuela welcomes integration efforts with\r\nother countries. The Andean Community is one such\r\nmeans, and that is why we would welcome its presence\r\nas an observer at the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.5.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/52/L.5?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.5 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/6).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 158?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI should like to inform delegates that agenda item 42,\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity”, originally scheduled for\r\nthis morning, will be taken up at a later date to be\r\nannounced. I should also like to inform members that the\r\nprogramme of work for the remainder of October, for the\r\nmonth of November and for the beginning of December\r\nhas been issued as document A/INF/52/3/Add.1 this\r\nmorning. The list of speakers for each of the items listed\r\nin that document is now open.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 October 1997\r\nThe General Assembly will be kept informed, in due\r\ncourse, of the dates for the consideration of other agenda\r\nitems as well as of any additions or changes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.\r\n21\r\n"
