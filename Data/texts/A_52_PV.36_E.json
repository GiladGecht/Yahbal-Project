(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 13\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice (A/52/4)\r\nThe President: This morning the Assembly will first\r\nturn to the report of the International Court of Justice\r\ncovering the period from 1 August 1996 to 31 July 1997.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nthe report of the International Court of Justice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Stephen Schwebel,\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Schwebel (President of the International Court of\r\nJustice): It is an honour for me to address the General\r\nAssembly on the occasion of its consideration of the annual\r\nreport of the International Court of Justice for the period\r\nAugust 1996 to August 1997. Speaking to the General\r\nAssembly on the Court’s report is a tradition which was\r\ninitiated by Sir Robert Jennings during his presidency of the\r\nCourt, and it is one that I am happy to maintain, as did my\r\nimmediate predecessor as President, Judge Bedjaoui.\r\nIt is a particular pleasure to speak to a General\r\nAssembly that meets under the presidency of Foreign\r\nMinister Udovenko. He is a leader of a State which recently\r\nhas taken an important step in support of the Court’s\r\njurisdiction.\r\nThis is the year in which the Organization welcomed\r\nMr. Kofi Annan as its new Secretary-General. Among the\r\nhighlights of the year for the Court was the visit to The\r\nHague by the Secretary-General in March, shortly after he\r\ntook office. Members of the Court took great pleasure in\r\nMr. Annan’s visit and in having the opportunity to discuss\r\nwith him, in depth, matters of current concern to the\r\nCourt and to the United Nations. It was in a very real\r\nsense a working visit. The Court appreciated the profound\r\ninterest in its work which that visit represented and the\r\nimpetus it gave to it.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in visiting The Hague, visited\r\nwhat is increasingly seen as the judicial capital of the\r\nworld. The Court is appreciative of the facilities of The\r\nHague and the courtesies of the host Government. It is\r\nappreciative of the support of the host Government and\r\nthe United Nations in extending the Peace Palace to\r\naccommodate the many Judges ad hoc and the staff of the\r\nRegistry, extensions which have been notably successful.\r\nIt looks forward to the celebrations of the centenary of\r\nthe Hague Peace Conference of 1899 and it follows with\r\nhigh interest the negotiations in respect of the\r\nestablishment of an international criminal court.\r\nIn the period under review, the Court gave a\r\nJudgment on 12 December 1996 upholding its jurisdiction\r\nin the case concerning Oil Platforms brought by the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran against the United States of\r\nAmerica. It then turned its attention to the case\r\nconcerning the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project, brought by\r\nSpecial Agreement between Hungary and Slovakia. It\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nconcerned a project for the joint construction of dams on\r\nthe Danube River — and very much more. Quite apart from\r\nthe exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused\r\nin those countries, and the variety of difficult and\r\nchallenging issues it raised — fundamental issues of the\r\nlaw of treaties, environmental law, the law of international\r\nwatercourses and of State succession and State\r\nresponsibility — the case presented a number of distinctive\r\nfeatures which called upon the Court’s resourcefulness.\r\nThe volume of pleadings and documentary annexes\r\nfiled exceeded 5,000 pages. There have been other cases of\r\nlike or larger dimension of pleadings — such as South West\r\nAfrica, Barcelona Traction, some Continental Shelf cases,\r\nand Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against\r\nNicaragua — but the majority of cases produce pleadings\r\nless massive. The Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros pleadings and\r\nannexes placed a considerable burden on the Court’s tiny\r\ntranslation services and on its budget.\r\nThe case also gave the Court the unique opportunity,\r\nbetween two rounds of oral hearings, at the joint invitation\r\nof the Parties,\r\n“to exercise its functions with regard to the obtaining\r\nof evidence at a place or locality to which the case\r\nrelates”. [A/52/4, para. 108]\r\nThis procedure is poetically known in French as a descente\r\nsur les lieux; in English, we have come to call it a “site\r\nvisit”. The Parties agreed on the detailed itinerary, content\r\nand logistical arrangements of the visit, and the full Court\r\nspent four days visiting locations along the Danube between\r\nBratislava and Budapest, accompanied by representatives of\r\nthe two States and their scientific advisers. The Court\r\nlooked, listened, asked many questions and gained a new\r\ndimension of insight into the case and what it meant to the\r\nParties — much more than could have been gleaned from\r\nconfining the proceedings to The Hague. I might add that\r\nit was all organized by the Parties with admirable\r\nefficiency.\r\nI use the word “unique” because it was the first time\r\nin the history of the present Court that such a working visit\r\nto a site of the dispute had been undertaken. The visit was\r\nnot entirely unprecedented. Almost 60 years ago, in May\r\n1937, the Permanent Court of International Justice spent\r\ntwo days visiting a number of locations rather closer to the\r\nseat of the Court, along the River Meuse between\r\nMaastricht and Antwerp, in connection with a dispute\r\nbetween the Netherlands and Belgium in the case\r\nconcerning the Diversion of Water from the Meuse. The\r\npublished record of that visit is terse, but even so, the\r\nparallels between the two exercises — as between the\r\ncases themselves and the character of the visits — turned\r\nout to be striking.\r\nThere have been other occasions when such visits\r\nwere requested by one party or canvassed, but for various\r\nreasons were not carried out by the Court. Clearly, the\r\nissues of law can usually be decided without such an\r\nexercise. In the exceptional case in which a site visit\r\nwould be useful, it would depend upon a high degree of\r\ncooperation between the States concerned, and one can\r\nimagine only some contentious cases in which the\r\nsituation on the ground may lend itself to carrying out a\r\nsite visit. There are also financial implications for the\r\nStates concerned. However, the successful completion of\r\nthis valuable procedure in the Gabčíkovo case is\r\nsuggestive.\r\nThe Court gave its Judgment in the Gabčíkovo case\r\non 24 September. The importance of that Judgment not\r\nonly for Hungary and Slovakia, but for the interpretation,\r\napplication and development of international law, is\r\nconsiderable. It is a Judgment of significance for the law\r\nof treaties, of State responsibility, of international\r\nwatercourses, of the environment and of State succession.\r\nThe Gabčíkovo Judgment is notable, moreover,\r\nbecause of the breadth and depth of the importance given\r\nin it to the work product of the International Law\r\nCommission. The Court’s Judgment not only draws on\r\ntreaties concluded pursuant to the Commission’s\r\nproceedings — those on the law of treaties, of State\r\nsuccession in respect of treaties, and the law of\r\ninternational watercourses; it also gives great weight to\r\nsome of the Commission’s draft articles on State\r\nresponsibility, as did both Hungary and Slovakia in their\r\npleadings. This is not wholly exceptional; rather it\r\nillustrates the fact that, just as the judgments and opinions\r\nof the Court have influenced the work of the International\r\nLaw Commission, so the work of the Commission may\r\ninfluence that of the Court.\r\nThe Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Judgment is noteworthy\r\ntoo because it is the first of the Court to be placed on the\r\nCourt’s own Internet website, and that on the day of\r\ndelivery of the Judgment. There was great use made of\r\nthis innovation and we are confident that there will be of\r\nour website generally.\r\nA last reason why the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros case is\r\nof particular interest is that it is, in a sense, ongoing, even\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nafter that Judgment. This is because of the nature of the\r\nparties’ agreement as to what the role of the Court was to\r\nbe. Essentially, in their Special Agreement, they handed\r\nover to the Court for resolution the legal aspects of a\r\ndispute which had deeply divided them at the political\r\nlevel, and which had proved intractable. The questions put\r\nby the parties, precisely framed, were clearly and\r\nconclusively answered by the Court in accordance with\r\ninternational law. But that is not where it ends; the Special\r\nAgreement goes on to provide that the parties shall\r\n“Immediately after the transmission of the\r\nJudgment ... enter into negotiations on the modalities\r\nfor its execution.”\r\nIt further provides that\r\n“If they are unable to reach agreement within six\r\nmonths, either party may request the Court to render\r\nan additional Judgment to determine the modalities for\r\nexecuting its Judgment.”\r\nSo, in a very real sense, the function of the Court in\r\nthis case has been to provide the parties with the legal\r\nanswers within which they may pursue their further\r\nnegotiations: in other words, to advance the progress of\r\ntheir mutual search for a solution by assuming\r\nresponsibility for defining the fundamental legal parameters\r\nof that process. It is for them to apply the Court’s Judgment\r\nin taking their negotiations to a new level. In so doing, they\r\nwill be directed not only by the Court’s Judgment about the\r\nlaw of the matter, about the legal rights and wrongs of the\r\npast. They will also be guided by the Court’s views as to\r\nthe practical content of future cooperative arrangements.\r\nThis recalls to mind the concept evoked by Sir Robert\r\nJennings when he addressed the Assembly in October 1993,\r\ncharting the tendency, already apparent then, for the Court\r\nto be seen not solely as a sort of judicial “last resort”,\r\nthough it is that, but also as “a partner in preventive\r\ndiplomacy”, a vital part of the machinery deployed by\r\nStates in the course of dispute resolution, machinery by\r\nwhich judicial findings of fact and rulings of law may\r\ndefine the bounds of constructive negotiations. The Court\r\nis gratified by the continuing development of this role, as\r\npart of the fabric of diplomatic negotiation with which the\r\nmembers of the community of nations interact to further the\r\nprinciples of the Charter and of international law.\r\nThis is why it is important to take account, in any\r\nassessment of the Court’s work, not only of the cases which\r\nhave been the subject of Judgments of the Court, and not\r\nonly of disputes which are settled because of the prospect\r\nof resort to the Court, but also of those cases which, at a\r\ncertain stage of the proceedings, have become ripe for\r\nand resulted in negotiated settlements.\r\nThere have been some telling examples in the past\r\nfew years. Sir Robert mentioned two. One was the case\r\non Certain Phosphate Lands between Nauru and\r\nAustralia, which was settled after a Judgment on\r\njurisdiction and admissibility favourable to Nauru. The\r\nother was the Great Belt case between Finland and\r\nDenmark, which was, after issuance of an order on a\r\nrequest for the indication of provisional measures, settled\r\nvery shortly before the expedited hearings on the merits\r\nwere to start, by negotiations which the Court had\r\nencouraged. The maritime delimitation case between\r\nGuinea-Bissau and Senegal also was discontinued by\r\nagreement, in the wake of a Judgment of the Court in a\r\nrelated case between those States. And, in another\r\nsettlement, like that of the Great Belt made virtually on\r\nthe courthouse steps, hearings due to take place in the\r\nAerial Incident case between the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nand the United States of America were postponed sine die\r\nat the request of the parties in 1994. Subsequently the\r\ncase was settled.\r\nThese breakthroughs in negotiation are to be\r\nwelcomed. They do, however, pose certain problems for\r\nthe Court in terms of deployment of its scarce resources,\r\nand I will return to this point in a moment.\r\nMy distinguished predecessor as President, Judge\r\nBedjaoui, took up the theme of the Court’s advisory\r\nfunction, its underutilization and its potential for\r\nexpansion to a wider spectrum of organs and agencies.\r\nSince then, as the Assembly is aware, the Court has given\r\ntwo important Advisory Opinions, in July 1996, one at\r\nthe request of the World Health Organization on the\r\nLegality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in\r\nArmed Conflict, and the other at the request of the\r\nGeneral Assembly itself, on the Legality of the Threat or\r\nUse of Nuclear Weapons. The Court has noted the\r\nresponse of the General Assembly, in resolution 51/45 M,\r\nto the Court’s opinion and its decision to include in the\r\nprovisional agenda of its fifty-second session an item\r\nentitled “Follow-up to the advisory opinion of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on the Legality of the\r\nThreat or Use of Nuclear Weapons”.\r\nThe limitations on the role of the Court can be\r\nstructural, jurisdictional or circumstantial. Of the latter,\r\nthe most obvious and immediate are resource constraints,\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nnotably, shortage of staff and money. The Court, a principal\r\norgan of the United Nations and, at the same time, in terms\r\nof staff and budget a very small fraction of it, has suffered\r\nseverely over the current budgetary biennium from\r\nbudgetary and staff cuts. However, the Secretary-General\r\nand his colleagues, and the Assembly itself, have been\r\nresponsive in helping the Court to deal with its difficulties,\r\nwith the fortuitous assistance of a rise in the value of the\r\ndollar. Their commitment to, and understanding of, the\r\nproper functioning of the Court as its Statute requires, is a\r\nmatter of profound appreciation by the Court.\r\nThe Court continues to confront a heavy caseload\r\nunder severe financial constraints. Resources are scarce and\r\nmust be wisely deployed. Even though we have made some\r\nchanges in the way in which we handle translation, our\r\nresources in this field are barely sufficient for the needs of\r\nimmediately pending cases. There is no room for forward\r\nplanning in the sense of embarking on the translation of\r\ncases which are not close to being ready for hearing, as\r\nthere is simply no way of funding it. Moreover, there is\r\nuncertainty about whether it will be a wasted effort in the\r\nevent of a settlement of the case before hearing.\r\nThis is why the consequences of an unpredicted\r\nsettlement on the courthouse steps, however desirable it\r\nmay be for the parties and for the broader interests of\r\ndispute resolution, can be disruptive of the Court’s carefully\r\nresourced schedule of work. It is hard, in the present\r\nfinancial climate, to have a fallback position, especially at\r\nthe merits phase of a case — that is, to have another case\r\nwhich is fully translated and ready for hearing, and which\r\ncan be brought forward at short notice. While in an ideal\r\nworld this would be desirable, in any event there is always\r\nan amplitude of pleadings requiring study by the members\r\nof the Court. The Court is at work even when it is not\r\npublicly sitting.\r\nA fundamental consideration is the undoubted strength\r\nof the Court sitting in The Hague in its full composition.\r\nFirst, it can truly claim to be universal: its Members\r\ntogether represent the main forms of civilization and the\r\nprincipal legal systems of the world. Secondly, in\r\ncombining both oral and written phases of procedure, it\r\nmarries the key features of the common and civil law\r\nsystems. The bench brings to bear the distinctive analytical\r\ntechniques of both. At the same time, the Court’s attitude\r\ntowards evidence is demonstrably flexible. And lastly —\r\nand this is important — its decision-making process,\r\ncarefully elaborated in the 1976 Resolution on the Internal\r\nJudicial Practice of the Court, is structured so as to permit\r\neach and every member of the Court to participate on an\r\nequal footing while maintaining the forward momentum\r\nof the drafting work.\r\nOn examining this resolution, one is struck by the\r\ncareful balance of considerations of equality and\r\ndiscipline, and also by the importance of having an agreed\r\nstructure and sequence to serve as the framework for the\r\nCourt’s deliberations. It is a coherent and coordinated\r\nprocess, with the emphasis squarely on the collective\r\nnature of the exercise. Consistently with this philosophy,\r\nJudges who might append separate or dissenting opinions\r\nstill participate fully in the discussions and influence the\r\ncontents of the Court’s work, so that the judgment is in\r\nevery sense the judgment of the whole Court. Those\r\nopinions are produced in the same time-frame as the\r\njudgment and are included with the text on the date it is\r\nrendered, rather than weeks or months later. If only\r\nbecause of the time it saves, which might otherwise be\r\nspent in discussing how to proceed — which can happen\r\nin arbitration, at a cost to the parties — the Court’s\r\nestablished practice is a boon, and there is more to\r\ncommend in it than that.\r\nAt the same time, any busy court must periodically\r\nreview its procedures to ensure that they meet the needs\r\nof the day. In the last dozen years the Court has become\r\nmuch busier while, in the last few years, operating under\r\nsharp financial restrictions.\r\nBecause of their very nature, the proceedings of the\r\nCourt cannot be swift — apart from provisional measures\r\nor the occasional urgent advisory opinion. The Court’s\r\nprocedures are designed to allow the institution\r\njudiciously to fulfil its unique and vital function in the\r\nservice of international law, and to protect and uphold\r\ncertain fundamental judicial principles. That function and\r\nthose principles remain vital.\r\nIt is desirable that cases should be dealt with as\r\nexpeditiously as possible, consistent with justice and with\r\nthe highest levels of professional care. States themselves\r\noften require substantial periods of time for the\r\npreparation of their written pleadings. At the same time,\r\nwith the increase in the Court’s caseload in recent years,\r\nthe time that elapses between the date when a case or a\r\nphase of a case is ready for a hearing, and when a case\r\nactually is heard, is too long, because the Court is still\r\ndealing with prior cases. The Court has been studying\r\nhow best this problem may be addressed.\r\nIt charged its Rules Committee with developing\r\nproposals to maximize the Court’s efficiency. The Court\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nhas recently adopted a range of alterations to its working\r\npractices. Some of these will involve the parties, and some\r\nonly the Court. The Court will inform parties to litigation\r\nof the new procedures that it proposes that may affect them.\r\nFor instance, a new case cannot, of course, be heard until\r\nits pleadings are ready in both French and English. Because\r\nthe translation of voluminous annexes of documents is\r\nexpensive and time-consuming, it is to be hoped that the\r\nparties to cases before the Court will exercise every care to\r\nensure that there are annexed to pleadings only those\r\ndocuments, or sections of documents, that are really\r\nrequired.\r\nAs for the measures that relate to the Court itself, it\r\nhas been the longstanding practice for each Judge, upon the\r\nconclusion of the oral proceedings of a case, to prepare a\r\nwritten note, of whatever length he or she thinks\r\nappropriate, analysing the key issues of law in the case.\r\nThese notes are translated and circulated for study before\r\nthe Judges meet to deliberate on a case. The Court has now\r\ndetermined that it may proceed without written notes where\r\nit considers it necessary, in suitable cases concerning the\r\njurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of the\r\napplication. This has already been the practice in the case\r\nof urgent requests for interim measures of protection. This\r\ndeparture will be on an experimental basis. The traditional\r\npractice regarding the preparation of written notes will be\r\ncontinued with regard to cases in which the Court is to\r\ndecide on the merits.\r\nThe Court has made further important decisions\r\ndirected to accelerating its work. In particular, appropriate\r\ncases on jurisdiction may be heard “back to back” — that\r\nis to say, in immediate succession — so that work may\r\nthen proceed on them both concurrently. This innovation\r\nwill be undertaken on an experimental basis, where there\r\nare appropriate cases and a pressing need to proceed\r\nrapidly.\r\nThe Court has also confirmed its recent practice in\r\ntrying to give the parties notice of its intended schedule for\r\nthe next three cases, believing that such forward planning\r\nassists both States and their counsel, and the Court.\r\nIn order to respond as best it may to the legitimate\r\naspirations of States to have their cases heard as soon as\r\npossible, the Court has decided upon these measures and\r\nalso upon a series of related and consequential changes in\r\nadministrative and internal practices.\r\nIf States and the Court together cooperate along the\r\nlines I have indicated, we believe cases — including those\r\non the current docket — can be ready for oral argument\r\nwithin an acceptable time after the conclusion of the\r\nwritten phase. States can come to the Court secure in the\r\nknowledge that their important legal disputes will be\r\njudicially resolved within a reasonable time.\r\nSupport for the Court from member States in its\r\nendeavour to continue to fulfil its statutory obligations in\r\nan optimal manner is, of course, most welcome. I note in\r\nthis connection the proposals made by Mexico to the\r\nsession of the Special Committee on the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of\r\nthe Organization, held in January and February of this\r\nyear. Mexico proposed that the International Court of\r\nJustice should be part of the ongoing process of reform\r\nand revitalization. Indeed it should.\r\nHowever, I would urge Member States to bear in\r\nmind that such initiatives must be developed within the\r\nframework of the Court’s Statute, which is an integral\r\npart of the Charter. The Statute can be amended, but no\r\nmore easily than the Charter itself, and any amendments\r\nwould require the most careful consideration. The Court\r\nitself, in the last article of its Statute, is given “power to\r\npropose such amendments to the present Statute as it may\r\ndeem necessary”. Article 30 of the Statute gives the Court\r\nthe sole power to frame rules for carrying out its\r\nfunctions, and in particular its rules of procedure. The\r\nCourt has, and must continue to enjoy, complete\r\nautonomy in establishing its own practices and procedures\r\nif its judicial independence is to be preserved. Equally, if\r\nit is to operate as the Charter provides, the Court must be\r\naccorded the resources to do its work. These are the\r\nessential conditions for the Court to further “the principles\r\nof justice and international law” to which the purposes of\r\nthe United Nations Charter refer.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe are grateful to Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, President\r\nof the International Court of Justice, for the report he has\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly. We appreciate this\r\nopportunity to strengthen the links of communication and\r\ncooperation between two principal organs of the United\r\nNations. We are pleased to note that this year’s report of\r\nthe Court was published earlier than usual. We hope that\r\nthis, which gives States timely information about the work\r\nof the Court, will continue in the future and will mark the\r\nbeginning of a more effective dialogue.\r\nThe pace of Court activities has increased\r\nconsiderably in recent years. We are pleased to note that\r\nStates turn more frequently to judicial means for the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nsettlement of their disputes. Yet in a situation where\r\ndisputes on points of law are a fact of life, recourse to\r\nCourt adjudication should be greater still.\r\nAt present, only 60 States — less than one third of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations — recognize as\r\ncompulsory the jurisdiction of the International Court of\r\nJustice. This is a very low figure in an Organization of 185\r\nMembers. During the reporting period, only one State,\r\nParaguay, deposited a declaration recognizing as\r\ncompulsory the Court’s jurisdiction as contemplated by\r\nArticle 36 of the Statute of the Court. We welcome the\r\ndecision taken by Paraguay and urge States that have not\r\nyet done so to do the same.\r\nWe are convinced that recognition of the Court’s\r\njurisdiction as compulsory by all the permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council would prove to be a crucial and\r\ndecisive element in promoting greater use of judicial means\r\nfor the settlement of disputes. At present, only the United\r\nKingdom recognizes this jurisdiction.\r\nThe broad dissemination of the publications and\r\ndecisions of the Court improves the study of international\r\nlaw and facilitates the understanding of that subject. That\r\nis why we particularly welcome the Court’s decision to set\r\nup an Internet site to expand the availability of its\r\ndocuments. We are confident that this decision will not\r\naffect the availability or the quantity of printed Court\r\ndocuments, which are still necessary in places with limited\r\naccess to electronic media.\r\nThere is a reference in paragraph 153 of the report to\r\nthe Court’s present budgetary restrictions. In his statement\r\nto the General Assembly at its fifty-first session, the\r\nPresident of the Court spoke of that issue and of other\r\nfactors that limit the capacity of the highest judicial organ\r\nto contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputes and to\r\nthe purpose of the maintenance of peace. The current\r\nPresident has just made reference to the same problem. The\r\ndelegation of Mexico is aware of these concerns and is\r\nconvinced that the Court must have all the practical means\r\nit needs to strengthen its role; in the Special Committee on\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening\r\nof the Role of the Organization, my delegation has\r\nencouraged a discussion of the impact that the increased\r\nnumber of cases before the Court has on the Court’s\r\nfunctioning.\r\nMs. Eshmambetova (Kyrgyzstan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe objective of this exchange is to help the Court\r\nto deal with a growing caseload. We reiterate today that\r\nthis exercise is not aimed at involving Member States in\r\nareas that are internal to the functioning to the Court, as\r\nthis is the sole purview of the institution itself; nor is it\r\naimed at leading to reforms in its Statute. The\r\nindependence and authority of the Court must be\r\npreserved at all times. We hope that the Court, as well as\r\nStates, will participate in this exercise, which we are\r\nconfident can lead to a strengthened institution.\r\nWe underscore once again the importance of the\r\nadvisory opinion handed down by the Court on 8 July\r\n1996 regarding the Legality of the Threat or Use of\r\nNuclear Weapons. In its opinion, the Court determined\r\nthat the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally\r\nbe contrary to the rules of international law applicable in\r\narmed conflict, and in particular the principles and rules\r\nof international humanitarian law. Likewise, and\r\nunanimously, it affirmed that there exists an obligation on\r\nthe part of all States to pursue in good faith and bring to\r\na conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament\r\nunder strict and effective international control. We note\r\nwith concern that, in spite of this opinion, there is no sign\r\nyet of an unequivocal commitment on the part of all\r\nStates to implement effectively this judgment by the\r\nCourt.\r\nIn the already long history of humankind, the\r\nexistence of this type of weapon constitutes an aberration\r\nwhich has lasted just a few decades. That is why we are\r\nconvinced that it must disappear, and why Mexico will\r\nremain committed and work to make nuclear disarmament\r\na reality in the near future.\r\nMr. Amorim (Brazil): I would like to start by\r\nthanking the President of the International Court of\r\nJustice (ICJ), Judge Schwebel, for his introduction of this\r\nyear’s report to the General Assembly. We welcome the\r\nopportunity afforded by the annual presentation of the\r\nICJ’s report to the General Assembly as a valuable\r\noccasion for an exchange on the work of the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations.\r\nDuring the Court’s fiftieth anniversary in 1996, there\r\nwere frequent references to a renewal of interest in its\r\nactivities. Judge Schwebel spoke of a burgeoning of the\r\nCourt, with an increasing number of cases in its docket\r\nsince the last decade. More recently, Judge Gilbert\r\nGuillaume has referred to “a resurrection of international\r\njustice”. Many have pointed out that justice can contribute\r\nto the maintenance of international peace, and that peace\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nfavours recourse to justice. There seems to be a growing\r\nperception that the end of the cold war is conducive to the\r\npacific settlement of disputes and that the International\r\nCourt of Justice can play an important role, together with\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, in\r\nfounding peace through justice, in conformity with the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe latest report from the ICJ indicates that at present\r\nthere are nine cases before the Court. These cases involve\r\ndisputes of varying nature, some of which have been\r\nassociated with the use or threat of use of force, while\r\nothers are of a more benign nature. In at least one case, the\r\nCourt has been instrumental in helping to prevent hostility\r\nbetween two bordering nations in Africa from degenerating\r\ninto an armed conflict. In other instances, it may be acting\r\nas a channel for preventive diplomacy, by defusing tensions\r\nwhich might otherwise have given way to unbridled\r\nantagonism.\r\nThe Judgment on the dispute concerning the projected\r\ndiversion of the Danube for the construction of a dam on\r\nthe Hungarian/Slovak border, made public after the issuance\r\nof the latest report, should hopefully contribute to\r\npromoting confidence and cooperation in a part of the\r\nworld that is only now beginning to overcome a difficult\r\nperiod of transition.\r\nIn addition to its role in solving the contentious cases\r\nbefore it, the Court retains its unique capacity to issue\r\nadvisory opinions on any legal question in response to\r\nrequests by the General Assembly and the Security Council.\r\nThe impact of the Advisory Opinion delivered on the\r\nLegality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons can still\r\nbe felt in the deliberations of the General Assembly, and\r\nthere are many who feel that greater use should be made of\r\nthe Court’s expertise under Article 96.\r\nAuthoritative voices have suggested that the capacity\r\nof United Nations organs and its specialized agencies to\r\nrequest advisory opinions might be extended to include\r\nother intergovernmental international organizations. Many\r\nconsider that the United Nations Secretary-General should\r\nbe authorized to request advisory opinions on legal\r\nquestions arising within the scope of his responsibilities.\r\nAs further evidence of the Court’s enduring relevance,\r\nthe number of treaties which provide for submission to it of\r\ndisputes arising thereunder continues to grow, and at last\r\ncount stood at 264, more than 100 of those being\r\nmultilateral treaties.\r\nFurthermore, in his critical appraisal of the ICJ’s\r\nfirst 50 years, the President of the Court has suggested\r\nthat affording other international courts the facility of\r\nappeal to the International Court of Justice merits\r\nconsideration, as specialized international courts multiply\r\nand the need arises to ensure that various international\r\ncourts do not develop conflicting interpretations of\r\ninternational law. The intensification of the negotiating\r\nprocess for the establishment of an international criminal\r\ncourt should be borne in mind in this context.\r\nAt the same time, the question of calling upon the\r\nCourt to examine the jurisdictional boundaries between\r\nthe different organs of the United Nations system and\r\ngranting it powers of judicial review over administrative\r\naction or political decisions is one that is likely to\r\nre-emerge some time in the future, given the appropriate\r\npolitical climate.\r\nIn short, in all likelihood, the workload of the judges\r\nwill tend to increase and to gain in significance. It is\r\ntherefore necessary that the General Assembly and the\r\ngeneral public be kept well informed of the Court’s\r\nactivities, and that appropriate resources be allocated for\r\nit to meet the rising demand for its services.\r\nThe section on publications and documents in this\r\nyear’s report admits that there have been delays caused by\r\nthe present budgetary restrictions in the publishing of the\r\nCourt’s fascicles and Yearbook, a trend which could give\r\nrise to concern if it were to persist. But more serious\r\nseem to be the warnings to the effect that the Court has\r\nbeen falling behind schedule in discharging its substantive\r\nresponsibilities. Remedies must be found to prevent such\r\nundue delays from giving rise to scepticism or\r\ndisillusionment regarding the Court’s international role, a\r\ndevelopment which would not be in conformity with the\r\nrising expectations of the international community for an\r\norder founded on the rule of law, as well as on\r\ntransparency and accountability.\r\nWe are grateful to the delegation of Mexico for\r\nhaving proposed that the Special Committee on the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of\r\nthe Role of the Organization examine practical ways and\r\nmeans to strengthen the Court and to enhance its capacity\r\nto contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputes and\r\nthe maintenance of international peace. As was clarified\r\nby the representative of Mexico, such an undertaking\r\ncould be carried out without the need to amend the\r\nCharter or the Statute, and without purporting to\r\nundermine the authority or independence of the Court.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nWe agree that some thought can usefully be given to\r\nimproving the Court’s capacity to deal with a larger number\r\nof cases in a more expeditious and efficient manner, and we\r\nwould concur with the suggestion that the Court itself, as\r\nwell as Member States, submit their written comments on\r\nthe matter.\r\nI should like briefly to digress, to make a comment\r\nthat I believe is relevant in this context.\r\nA draft resolution was circulated on 22 October which\r\nraises important legal questions going beyond the\r\nimmediate aims of its proponents. The draft, contained in\r\ndocument A/52/L.7, suggests that there is a\r\n“need to comply faithfully with the provisions of\r\nArticle 108 of the Charter of the United Nations with\r\nrespect to any resolution with Charter amendment\r\nimplications”.\r\nThe word “implications” is dangerously vague,\r\npossibly intentionally. The Charter does not provide for the\r\nadoption of draft resolutions according to Article 108,\r\nwhich applies specifically to amendments. Is it admissible\r\nthat the majorities mentioned in Article 108 become\r\napplicable to draft resolutions which are not actual Charter\r\namendments through the adoption of a draft resolution\r\nitself? And, assuming it is, would not that draft resolution\r\nitself be subject, by the same logic, to Article 108\r\nprovisions in turn, since it would stretch too far the\r\nmeaning of a Charter provision?\r\nIt should be recalled that Article 108 also refers to\r\nratification, and requires that the five permanent members\r\nof the Security Council approve the amendments before\r\nthey come into force. Is it thus being suggested that\r\nresolutions which may or may not in the future be\r\ntranslated into Charter amendments would be subject to\r\nratification, and thus to the veto? Is it acceptable to\r\nintroduce the veto power into the General Assembly? A\r\nresolution, may I recall, is not an amendment; it is the\r\nsense of the General Assembly, even if, at a future stage,\r\nit may be the basis of an amendment, which then, but only\r\nthen, would be subject, of course, to the provisions of\r\nArticle 108.\r\nWithout going into the political merit of the\r\nrequirement for a large majority when important draft\r\nresolutions are voted on, a requirement with which we\r\nagree, we must consider carefully the serious precedents\r\nthese drafts, if adopted, would establish.\r\nThis is the kind of question that would probably\r\nbenefit from the Court’s legal advice, provided it can act\r\nexpeditiously.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): I would like to start\r\nby expressing my gratitude for the comprehensive and\r\nenlightening report of Mr. Stephen Schwebel, President of\r\nthe International Court of Justice.\r\nMy country, one of 60 of the 185 parties to the\r\nStatute of the Court that recognize as compulsory the\r\njurisdiction of the Court, continues to give work of the\r\nCourt the highest regard and importance. We feel that the\r\nCourt is significant not only as a distinguished and viable\r\nvenue for the settlement of disputes, but also as a major\r\nfactor in maintaining faith in the law in our fragmented\r\nglobal legal system.\r\nStates by and large prefer that the Court avoid\r\ncreating law. States would still like to reserve that\r\nexercise for themselves. But the Court’s pronouncements\r\nare a primary source for international lawyers, scholars\r\nand policy makers. Practically every paragraph of a\r\ndecision or advisory opinion is scrutinized, probed,\r\nexamined and quoted. Most cases and advisory opinions\r\nlead to publicists’ filling journals and books with\r\nhundreds of pages of analysis and comments. In that\r\nsense, the Court plays a significant role in saying what\r\nthe law is for a great many people.\r\nStates make treaties. States make the practice and\r\nmanifest the opinio juris that build customary law. States,\r\nin so doing, look to the work of the Court. The body of\r\nwork created by the Court is probably the most influential\r\nfactor when a State acts in the context of making or\r\napplying international law.\r\nIt is a truism in most legal systems that hard cases\r\nmake bad law. In the international arena, so far, hard\r\ncases make no law. With far too few exceptions, the truly\r\nsignificant disputes and conflicts in the world are still to\r\nsee the light of day in the Court or in any other judicial\r\nor third-party forum. This is still true today, even though\r\na State that finds itself tempted by self-interest to erode\r\ntraditional and established norms may in time regret its conduct.\r\nSome have pointed to the non-compulsory\r\njurisdiction of the Court as its major weakness. In some\r\ninstances, those involved in a dispute lament that the\r\nCourt does not have universal and compulsory\r\njurisdiction. This is an attitude that oversimplifies the\r\nnature and content of international disputes. The non-\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court for them becomes an\r\nexcuse for inaction.\r\nMy region is experiencing an era of peace and stability\r\nthat has provided a firm basis for its sustained progress and\r\ngrowth. Yet we are not without problems. In the seas\r\ncentral to our region, we have disputes over territory and\r\nboundaries. The Philippines has consistently taken a\r\nposition of resolving these disputes peacefully, including\r\nbringing them to the Court. We continue to maintain this\r\nposition.\r\nWe have been moving forward in addressing these\r\ndisputes, though the steps we have taken are small, few and\r\ncautious. We are confident that we will find a just, peaceful\r\nand lasting solution to this situation, and we study very\r\nclosely each and every legal pronouncement and\r\nformulation the Court makes in cases before it that concern\r\nterritorial and maritime disputes.\r\nFrom the report of the Court, we note that the Court’s\r\ndocket today is the fullest it has ever been. There was a\r\ntime when it was not so full. There was a time when the\r\nCourt had so few cases that the rumoured practice of the\r\nChief Clerk of the Permanent Court of International Justice\r\nwould come to mind. In the 1920s and 1930s the Chief\r\nClerk of that Court was said to have made his way about\r\nthe capitals of Europe as a kind of agent provocateur,\r\ntalking up border disputes that the Court could adjudicate.\r\nBut I anticipate that even more cases will be brought\r\nto the Court. The end of the cold war meant a reduction in\r\nthe role that power played in determining the outcome of\r\nState behaviour in its many aspects. Today states have the\r\nlaw as a primary guide for their behaviour. Also the stigma\r\nof resorting to third parties is declining.\r\nOur interdependent world is turning into a very\r\ncomplex one. While the reports of the death of the State are\r\nexaggerated, today States are disaggregating into separate,\r\nfunctionally distinct parts. Non-State and sub-State actors\r\nthat bring with them vastly complex and wide varieties of\r\nissues are forcing us to reassess the rules that govern us.\r\nThese factors, unimaginable only a decade ago, are causing\r\nStates to be as creative in resolving their disputes as the\r\nsituation demands.\r\nThe changed global circumstances has also made\r\npossible one of the most significant requests for an advisory\r\nopinion ever made of the Court. While a definitive ruling\r\non the specific issue before it would have been desirable,\r\nthe assumption by the Court of its jurisdiction on a highly\r\npolitical issue and its subsequent Advisory Opinion on the\r\nLegality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons is a\r\nwelcome development. The Court must, therefore, have\r\nthe resources by which to play its increasing role in\r\nresolving disputes and in the progress of international law.\r\nIn spite of the logistical difficulties facing the Court,\r\nit has not failed to keep up with technology and the\r\nchallenges of cyberspace. The Court has an impressive\r\nwebsite, dignified and full of useful information, yet user-\r\nfriendly. While the website contains many useful\r\ndocuments, I hope that the day will come when the\r\nCourt’s wisdom and erudition will truly be available to\r\nanyone who can dial up a server and access the Internet.\r\nOn my visit to the Court’s website, I saw that the\r\ndecisions and pleadings in two or three cases were\r\naccessible through its website.\r\nIt is my hope that one day all the decisions, advisory\r\nopinions, orders and pleadings of the Court will be\r\navailable on the website. I know that this is a rather\r\ndaunting task, considering the current limitations\r\nexperienced by the Court. Neither do I wish to deprive of\r\ntheir business existing websites or services that offer these\r\ndocuments at prices only rich law firms or well-endowed\r\ninstitutions can afford. But there is much that the Court\r\nsays about international law that could help guide States,\r\nnot only in settling disputes, but also in preventing them,\r\nas well as in their general dealings with other subjects\r\nand objects of international law.\r\nWhile on the subject of the Court’s Internet\r\npresence, I could not help but notice something else about\r\nits website. The word “web” in Internet language is used\r\non purpose, and is very descriptive of the nature and\r\npractice in the Internet of linkages and interusage. Yet, in\r\nwhat is a rather rare case for websites on the Internet, the\r\nCourt’s website has no links with other sites, not even\r\nwith the United Nations Home Page.\r\nAs an avid user of the Internet, at first I found this\r\nstrange. But after a few seconds of cybershock I realized\r\nthe profound symbolism in this: that the Court is indeed\r\nan independent body. It is this independence, together\r\nwith its probity and integrity, and a well-deserved\r\ninfusion of resources, that will sustain the Court as it\r\ncontinues to assume a central role in the pursuit of justice\r\nand the maintenance of world peace.\r\nMr. Kamaruddin Bin Ahmad (Malaysia): My\r\ndelegation wishes to congratulate Judge Stephen M.\r\nSchwebel on his re-election, as well as his elevation to\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nthe presidency of the International Court of Justice, and to\r\nthank him for his report in document A/52/4. My delegation\r\nalso wishes to congratulate both Judge Pieter H. Kooijmans\r\nand Judge Francesco Rezek on their election to the Court.\r\nOur felicitations also go to Judges M. Bedjaoui and S.\r\nVereshchetin on their re-election.\r\nMy delegation notes that there has been increasing\r\nrecourse to the Court by Member States over the years. It\r\nis also heartening to note that 60 States have made\r\ndeclarations recognizing as compulsory the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Court, as stipulated in article 36, paragraphs 2 and 5, of\r\nthe Statute. This positive development is to be welcomed,\r\nas it will contribute to the continued relevance and\r\nstrengthening of the Court in the United Nations system.\r\nThe International Court of Justice, like other United\r\nNations organs, has an important role to play in the\r\npromotion of peace and harmony between nations and\r\npeoples of the world through the rule of law. However, it\r\nis disquieting to note that nine contentious cases under the\r\nCourt’s review are still pending. Some of these cases, in\r\nmy delegation’s view, would have been expeditiously\r\nsolved, especially when much substantive work has already\r\nbeen done, but for the objections of certain Member States\r\nby virtue of article 79, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court.\r\nIn our view, resorting to that article too frequently will only\r\ndelay settlement of the cases, and will not be in the overall\r\ninterest of Member States. We would, therefore, urge\r\nparties to disputes before the Court to cooperate as fully as\r\npossible with it to ensure an expeditious settlement of their\r\ndisputes.\r\nIn the light of the increase in the number of cases\r\nreferred to the International Court of Justice in the last\r\nseveral years, there is an urgent need to strengthen the\r\nCourt’s capacity to handle these cases. We note that the\r\nCourt has been placed under a severe strain, with reductions\r\nin both its human and financial resources. Consequently, it\r\nhas not been able satisfactorily to provide its judicial\r\nservices to meet with the increasing demands made by\r\nMember States. My delegation, therefore, strongly supports\r\nthe call for the Court to be given adequate human and\r\nfinancial resources to enable it to fulfil its functions and\r\nresponsibilities as an important organ within the United\r\nNations system. My delegation further hopes that, with the\r\nestablishment and commissioning of the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, States will consider\r\nreferring their maritime disputes to the Tribunal, thereby\r\nlessening the Court’s burden.\r\nAs the only judicial organ of the United Nations, the\r\nCourt, my delegation also believes, should be a source of\r\nadvisory opinions for other organs of the United Nations.\r\nThe intergovernmental organs of the United Nations\r\nshould not only utilize the Court as a source that can\r\ninterpret the relevant and applicable laws, but should also\r\nrefer controversial issues to the Court for advisory\r\nopinions. In this regard, Malaysia is particularly pleased\r\nwith the Advisory Opinion rendered by the Court last\r\nyear on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear\r\nWeapons, which, in the view of my delegation, was an\r\nimportant development in the issue of nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nIt is clear to my delegation that the Court’s\r\njudgments and opinions have all contributed to the\r\nprogressive development of international law, and this is\r\nconsistent with the thrust and aims of the United Nations\r\nDecade of International Law programme. Even if, on\r\noccasions, a request to file a case has been dismissed by\r\nthe Court on certain legal or technical grounds, the filing\r\nof these cases has, nevertheless, had a salutary impact on\r\naccount of the publicity generated.\r\nMy delegation commends the efforts made by the\r\nCourt to increase public awareness and understanding of\r\nits work, such as through the various talks and lectures\r\ngiven by the President and other members of the Court,\r\nas well as by the Registrar and other officials of the\r\nCourt. While disseminating information about the Court\r\nthrough traditional methods is to be welcomed and further\r\nencouraged, my delegation believes that the use of\r\nadvanced technology in enhancing public awareness about\r\nthe Court and its activities should be improved. To this\r\nend, we express strong support for the steps taken by the\r\nCourt to take advantage of the benefits provided by the\r\nelectronic media, such as the Internet, and in particular\r\nthe construction of its own website, which should\r\nfacilitate public access to the Court’s voluminous\r\ndocuments.\r\nIn conclusion, it is the view of my delegation that,\r\nlike the other organs and institutions within the United\r\nNations system, the International Court of Justice should\r\ndirectly benefit from the ongoing reform process\r\nundertaken by the United Nations. A revitalized\r\nInternational Court of Justice should certainly contribute\r\nto its effectiveness and efficiency in handling the many\r\ncases before it, thereby enhancing the role of the Court in\r\nthe promotion of justice under international law.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nMr. Rebagliati (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): First, I should like to welcome Judge Stephen M.\r\nSchwebel to this Hall, and say how pleased Argentina is at\r\nhis election to the Presidency of the International Court of\r\nJustice (ICJ). We would also like to express our\r\nappreciation to Judge Mohammed Bedjaoui for the brilliant\r\nleadership he demonstrated during his Presidency.\r\nArgentina attaches particular importance to this type\r\nof dialogue which takes place annually between the General\r\nAssembly and the International Court of Justice to examine\r\nthe progress of the Court’s work. This periodic contact not\r\nonly demonstrates the General Assembly’s interest in the\r\nCourt’s activities, it is also exemplary of the close\r\ncooperation that must exist between the principal organs of\r\nthe United Nations for the attainment of their objectives.\r\nThe ICJ, in its capacity as the international\r\ncommunity’s principal judicial organ, has fundamental\r\nresponsibilities for the peaceful settlement of disputes\r\nthrough the application of the rule of law. In fulfilling this\r\nspecific function, the Court occupies a privileged place in\r\nthe overall system for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nWithout being unduly optimistic, we must emphasize\r\nthe growing importance of the Court and the law in today’s\r\nworld. Though international society remains consensus-\r\ndriven, it is clear that international relations are increasingly\r\npermeated by the law. The rule of law is of particular\r\nimportance in weaving the international fabric of a\r\nglobalized society in which unity and interdependence\r\ncoexist with a trend towards fragmentation and the\r\nworsening of local conflicts.\r\nThe progress in international law is manifested in the\r\ngrowing will of States to submit their disputes to\r\njurisdictional dispute settlement mechanisms, and to accept\r\nadjudication by third parties in order to make State\r\nresponsibility effective. At the same time, States are\r\nmoving towards establishing the individual penal\r\nresponsibility of those who commit extremely grave\r\ninternational crimes, through the creation of special courts\r\nand the forthcoming establishment of an international\r\ncriminal court.\r\nAll of this reveals the aspiration of States to strengthen\r\nthe law and punish violations. More generally, it reflects the\r\ninternational community’s progressive recognition that\r\njustice is an essential component of a stable peace.\r\nIn this context, the number and complexity of the\r\ncases brought before the International Court of Justice\r\nattests, in particular, to the willingness of States to submit\r\nand entrust to the Court the most varied aspects of\r\ninternational relations.\r\nIn the period covered by the report, the Court has\r\nhandled cases involving central aspects of international\r\npeace and security, such as questions arising from the\r\naerial incident at Lockerbie, oil platforms, or the\r\nimplementation of the international Convention on the\r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\r\nThe fact that the Court is dealing with matters that\r\nare undoubtedly among the most complex and topical of\r\ninternational law reveals the growing international trust in\r\nits authority, integrity, impartiality and independence. Its\r\nvitality and prestige have been reflected not only in the\r\nnature of the cases brought before it, but also in the\r\nincrease in the number of States from all regions that\r\nhave turned to the Court for the settlement of disputes. At\r\nthe same time, the will of States to develop international\r\nlaw and broaden its content is apparent. This, in turn,\r\nshould benefit the functions of the Court by strengthening\r\nthe legal basis for their exercise.\r\nThe States must see to it that the International Court\r\nof Justice will be able to cope with the expected\r\nexpansion of its activities. The Court is endowed by its\r\nStatute and rules with the procedural tools it needs in\r\norder effectively to carry out its functions, both with\r\nrespect to dispute settlement and in the framework of its\r\nequally important advisory authority.\r\nWe must ensure that the Court is also provided with\r\nadequate resources to make the best use of those tools,\r\nwhich were designed by the founding fathers and the\r\nmembers of the Court themselves. At a time when our\r\nOrganization is confronting severe budgetary restraints\r\nand is debating the process of reform, we most not allow\r\ncircumstantial problems to undermine the ICJ’s immense\r\npotential in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nMr. Berrocal Soto (Costa Rica) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation is pleased to be able to take the\r\nfloor in this debate on the report of the International Court\r\nof Justice (document A/52/4). We are particularly honoured\r\nby the presence of the distinguished President of the Court,\r\nJudge Schwebel, whose erudition is well known and widely\r\nadmired.\r\nCosta Rica has renounced the force of arms and\r\naccepted the force of law. International law is the sole,\r\nreliable guarantee of our independence and sovereignty. Our\r\nfaith in the principles of the Charter has enabled us to\r\nthrow off the financial and budgetary burden of maintaining\r\nan army and has enabled us to build a more humane and\r\njust society, based on universal respect for human rights.\r\nThis year my country is celebrating the forty-ninth\r\nanniversary of the constitutional abolition of its armed\r\nforces. In this connection, respect and support for the rule\r\nof law are the fundamental pillars of our foreign policy and\r\nour position here in the United Nations. The promotion of\r\nhuman rights, respect for international humanitarian law,\r\nthe implementation of the principle of non-intervention,\r\ntotal adherence to the prohibition of the use of force and\r\nthe fostering of democracy as the ideal way to realize the\r\nright of peoples to self-determination — these are all\r\nrecurring themes in our international actions, both here in\r\nthe General Assembly and in the Security Council. Only\r\nrespect for those principles, which are central to\r\ninternational law, can enable us to build an international\r\nsociety that is more humane, just and harmonious, more\r\npeaceful and more civilized.\r\nIn this, the International Court of Justice plays a\r\ncentral role. Any legal system requires effective machinery\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes. If that machinery\r\ndid not exist, disputes would interfere with the normal\r\nprocesses of international relations and could become\r\nthreats to peace. States therefore have an unequivocal\r\nobligation to settle disputes peacefully and without recourse\r\nto armed force. In this connection, the International Court\r\nof Justice is eminently well equipped. When States are\r\nunable to settle their disputes through negotiations, they can\r\nhave recourse to the Court in exercise of their sovereign\r\nright to choose the means to settle disputes. Only the Court\r\npossesses the appropriate intellectual and material resources\r\nto analyse thoroughly the various de facto and de jure\r\narguments submitted by the parties to the dispute, and only\r\nthe Court can then hand down a solution to satisfy the\r\nparties’ desire for justice within the context of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nFurthermore — and this is one of its essential\r\nfunctions — the International Court of Justice plays a\r\ncentral role in the progressive development of\r\ninternational law. In particular, Costa Rica believes that\r\nthe Court’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the\r\nThreat or Use of Nuclear Weapons is one of the\r\nmilestones in the development of international law,\r\nrecognizing as it does the obligation on all States to enter\r\ninto negotiations in good faith on complete nuclear\r\ndisarmament under effective international control. My\r\ncountry is fully committed to compliance with that\r\ncommitment and is prepared to participate in such\r\nfundamental and necessary negotiations at any time.\r\nIn the light of what I have said, and given the\r\nextremely important role of the International Court of\r\nJustice, it is regrettable that so far only one third of the\r\nStates of the international community — some 60 States\r\nonly — have recognized the compulsory jurisdiction of\r\nthe Court. It is also regrettable that, in addition, many of\r\nthem have limited their recognition by expressing\r\nreservations, thereby unnecessarily restricting the work\r\nthat the Court can accomplish. Costa Rica therefore\r\ninvites all States that have not yet done so to recognize\r\nthe Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. Costa Rica believes,\r\nin particular, that recognition of that jurisdiction should be\r\na requirement for all States whose nationals are\r\nnominated as candidates to such a lofty tribunal, for\r\npermanent members of the Security Council and for those\r\nthat wish to become permanent members under the\r\nreforms currently being discussed at this fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We call upon the 120\r\ncountries that have not yet recognized the compulsory\r\njurisdiction of the Court to do so, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of paragraphs 2 and 5 of article 36 of the\r\nCourt’s Statute.\r\nThe International Court of Justice is flourishing. The\r\nnumber of cases before it, as reflected in the report\r\n(A/52/4) now before the Assembly, is unusually high, and\r\nit is especially being used by developing countries. In\r\naddition, as we have said, the recent Advisory Opinions\r\non the legality of the use of nuclear weapons involved the\r\nparticipation of an unprecedented number of States. This\r\nattests to the growing interest and confidence in the\r\nCourt, which we believe is a very healthy and positive\r\ntrend.\r\nHowever, we cannot fail to mention that proceedings\r\nbefore the Court continue to present unnecessary\r\ndifficulties for developing States. Litigation, if not the\r\nCourt’s Statute and rules, requires lengthy pleadings and\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 27 October 1997\r\nextensive documentation, dozens of lawyers and long years\r\nbefore the Court can reach a final decision on a case. This\r\nentails prohibitive costs for most States, and is one of the\r\nreasons for the Court’s present financial crisis. The Court\r\nshould refrain from encouraging such practices. On the\r\ncontrary, it should discourage the unnecessary submission\r\nand presentation of evidence and documentation, which\r\nmust be translated by the Court. Furthermore, judges should\r\nset limits on the length and extent of their separate and\r\ndissenting opinions, realizing that the quality of the Court’s\r\nopinions is not dependent on their copiousness or their\r\nscope. If those practical and concrete steps could be taken,\r\nat the Court’s discretion and respecting the sovereign right\r\nof parties to present their cases, and the independence of\r\nthe judges, the Court could resolve its present financial\r\ncrisis and become more efficient in dealing with the cases\r\nsubmitted for its consideration.\r\nWe cannot, of course, deny that the financial crisis of\r\nthe United Nations itself has imposed serious restraints on\r\nthe work of the Court. We must strengthen the Court’s\r\nbudget so that it can rebuild the necessary administrative\r\nand investigative services it requires to carry out its work\r\neffectively. My delegation recognizes the efforts the Court\r\nhas made recently to increase the dissemination of\r\ninformation. We welcome in particular the idea of having\r\ndocuments and judgments made available to the public on\r\nthe Internet. We believe that will not only reduce costs in\r\nthe future but will also promote knowledge of and research\r\ninto the work of the Court, particularly in developing\r\ncountries that do not normally have access to the Court’s\r\ndocumentation but can now access it on the Internet. That\r\nis indeed important progress that should be noted.\r\nThe International Court of Justice and other\r\ninternational bodies concerned with the administration of\r\njustice — such as the International Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea and the international criminal court whose\r\nestablishment is now being negotiated — embody the joint\r\neffort the international community is making to ensure the\r\nrule of law in the conduct of international relations. In this\r\nconnection, these bodies are an essential part of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMy country wishes once again to reiterate its full\r\nsupport for and confidence in the outstanding work the\r\nCourt has done, as reflected in its important decisions.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 13, “Report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice”.May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 13?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members that\r\nagenda item 27, entitled “Return or restitution of cultural\r\nproperty to the countries of origin”, originally scheduled\r\nfor tomorrow morning, Tuesday, 28 October, will be\r\ntaken up at a later date to be announced.\r\nAgenda item 14, entitled “Report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency”, originally scheduled for Monday\r\nmorning, 3 November, will now be taken up on\r\nWednesday, 12 November, in the morning.\r\nI should now like to make an announcement\r\nconcerning agenda item 20, entitled “Strengthening of the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance\r\nof the United Nations, including special economic\r\nassistance”, which is scheduled for consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly on Monday, 24 November in the\r\nmorning.\r\nI have requested His Excellency Mr. Ernst\r\nSucharipa, Permanent Representative of Austria to the\r\nUnited Nations, who during the three previous sessions so\r\nably coordinated the informal consultations on draft\r\nresolutions under the same agenda item, to assist once\r\nagain in the same capacity at this session, and\r\nAmbassador Sucharipa has graciously accepted.\r\nMay I request those delegations intending to submit\r\ndraft resolutions under agenda item 20 to do so as early\r\nas possible in order to allow time, if need be, for\r\nnegotiations with a view to reaching consensus on the\r\ndraft resolutions.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.35 p.m.\r\n13\r\n"
