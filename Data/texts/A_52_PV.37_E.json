(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.35 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 120 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/52/350/Add.5)\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the General\r\nAssembly’s attention to document A/52/350/Add.5. In a\r\nletter contained in that document, the Secretary-General\r\ninforms the President of the General Assembly that, since\r\nthe issuance of his communications dated 16 and 29\r\nSeptember and 6, 8 and 14 October 1997, Togo has made\r\nthe necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the\r\namount specified in Article 19 of the Charter. May I take\r\nit that the General Assembly duly takes note of this\r\ninformation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 29\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/456)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.9)\r\nThe President: The conclusion, on 24 July 1996, of\r\nthe cooperation agreement between the United Nations and\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union, which is the oldest of all the\r\nparliamentary organizations, signified a very encouraging\r\ndevelopment which, to my mind, will continue to acquire\r\never-growing importance. Moreover, the agreement is\r\nvery attuned to the spirit of the ongoing United Nations\r\nreform and thus should be further strengthened.\r\nDuring the current session, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/7 of 25 October 1996, we\r\nwill have to elaborate further steps for the practical\r\nimplementation of that agreement. There is no doubt that\r\nour discussion will concentrate on, among other things,\r\nthe issue of providing this cooperation with a modern and\r\nadequate framework.\r\nI now call on the representative of Spain to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.9.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nSince this is the first time that I am addressing the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session, may I congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to its presidency. I hope that you\r\nwill continue to show throughout this session the\r\nexcellent leadership that you have exercised over our\r\nwork during these first weeks.\r\nIt is a source of great satisfaction for me to address\r\nthis meeting of the General Assembly under agenda item\r\n29 to introduce draft resolution A/52/L.9 on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion.\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nThis draft resolution is sponsored by 88 delegations,\r\nwhich is solid testimony to the importance that Member\r\nStates accord to the cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In addition to the\r\nMember States listed in the draft resolution, other States\r\nhave joined the list of co-sponsors: Burkina Faso, Gabon,\r\nIndonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Niger, San Marino, Singapore,\r\nJamaica, Chad, Kuwait, Turkmenistan and Djibouti.\r\nThere is no doubt that cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union has grown\r\nsignificantly since the conclusion of the cooperation\r\nagreement on 24 July 1996, leading to the joint undertaking\r\nof various activities by the two organizations. The\r\npreambular paragraphs of draft resolution A/52/L.9 echo\r\nthese positive developments, which are set out in detail in\r\nthe timely report (A/52/456) submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral pursuant to resolution 51/7, which was adopted by\r\nthe Assembly last year without a vote.\r\nBoth the Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in Seoul\r\nlast April and the session in Cairo in September attest to\r\nthese positive developments. In Cairo, a member of the\r\nSpanish Parliament, Mr. Miguel Angel Martínez, succeeded\r\nan illustrious Egyptian, Dr. Ahmed Fathi Sorour, as\r\nPresident of the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,\r\nwhose Executive Committee is currently composed of\r\nmembers of the Parliaments of the Republic of Korea,\r\nMexico, Jordan, Iceland, India, Estonia, Argentina, Italy,\r\nZambia, Burkina Faso, Poland and the Russian Federation.\r\nFor all these reasons, as well as the strengthened\r\ncooperation endeavours between the United Nations and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union, Mr. Pierre Cornillon, and the\r\nmembers of their staffs, for their efforts in support of this\r\ncooperation.\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.9 recalls in its preamble the\r\nimportance of the cooperation agreement between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In its\r\noperative part, it notes with appreciation the increased\r\ncooperation between the two organizations; recommends\r\nthat this cooperation be further strengthened, at a time when\r\nthe United Nations is preparing to meet the challenges of\r\nthe twenty-first century; requests the Secretary-General to\r\nsubmit a further report to the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nthird session; and decides to include this item in the\r\nprovisional agenda of its next session.\r\nTherefore, and since the draft resolution has no\r\nbudgetary implications, I would like to propose, on behalf\r\nof all the co-sponsors, that the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/52/L.9 be adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Ahamed (India): It is a great privilege to speak\r\nin support of cooperation between the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion (IPU) and the United Nations. The important initial\r\nstep of establishing a framework of cooperation between\r\nthe two organizations, with the conclusion of the\r\ncooperation agreement on 24 July 1996, has opened up\r\nimportant new possibilities of mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation. That the signature of this agreement was\r\nfollowed in quick succession by the conclusion by the\r\nIPU of similar cooperation agreements with the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization (FAO) is adequate testimony to the validity\r\nof the principles underlying the need for closer interaction\r\nbetween the IPU and the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies. We need to pool our resources and\r\nour experience to devise common plans of action to\r\naddress our shared concerns.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union includes\r\nrepresentatives of the people, untrammelled by their\r\naffiliations to a particular political ideology or belief.\r\nThey come from both the Government and the opposition,\r\nproviding a unique flavour to our deliberations. The\r\nUnion thus represents, better than many other forums, the\r\ndiverse will of the people in the true sense of the term.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report contained in\r\ndocument A/52/456, has stated that parliamentarians are\r\na key group and that national parliaments have a major\r\nrole to play in the pursuit of the goals of the United\r\nNations. I would like to express my full support for this\r\nstatement and to assure the Secretary- General that the\r\nparliamentarians are alive and responsive to the concerns\r\nof humankind. They will contribute to ensure effective\r\nimplementation of the goals of United Nations\r\nconferences and summits and the shared goals of creating\r\na world characterized by diminishing injustice and\r\nincreasing happiness, and promoting social progress and\r\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom.\r\nThe possibilities of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the IPU are enormous. Some of them have\r\nbeen detailed by the Secretary-General in his report and\r\ndeserve our commendation. Our cooperation for the\r\npromotion of peace and security, and for the promotion of\r\ndemocracy and to follow up on major United Nations\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nconferences and summits, must be intensified and enriched\r\nto the benefit of humankind. Promotion of democracy at all\r\nlevels is the key area in which the experience of the IPU\r\ncould be effectively utilized by the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies or funds and programmes. The recent\r\nadoption by the IPU of a Universal Declaration on\r\nDemocracy at its meeting in Cairo in September earlier this\r\nyear could guide our common endeavours.\r\nFull participation of women in all aspects of economic\r\nand social life of our peoples and their political\r\nempowerment is one of the guarantees of democracy. As a\r\ncountry devoted to social uplift, India has enacted\r\nsignificant socially emancipating legislation, including\r\nreservation of one third of the seats in locally elected\r\nmunicipal and village-level bodies, the panchayats, through\r\nconstitutional amendment. This has brought to the fore a\r\ncritical body of women, more than a million strong, which\r\nis now taking charge not only of the lives of their families,\r\nbut also of entire villages and municipalities in my country.\r\nIndia also organized a specialized conference of the\r\nIPU on partnership between men and women in politics in\r\nNew Delhi from 14 to 18 February 1997. It brought\r\ntogether an equal number of men and women from over 80\r\nparliaments and intensified our efforts to highlight gender\r\nissues, particularly in the political sphere.\r\nI recall the message to the Conference by the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nwho said that the Conference\r\n“marks an admirable step forward in our joint efforts\r\ntowards a goal we all share: achieving the equality of\r\nwomen and men in politics, in decision-making and in\r\nall other realms of human endeavour”.\r\nMy delegation is therefore happy to note that the\r\nspecialized conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union\r\nhosted by India has been followed by other joint initiatives\r\nof the United Nations and the IPU in this field. The\r\ninvitation extended by the Commission on the Status of\r\nWomen to the President of the IPU Coordinating\r\nCommittee of Women Parliamentarians to its 1997 session,\r\nas a part of a panel on women in decision-making, deserves\r\nto be commended. The utilization by the United Nations of\r\nthe database of women in politics, prepared for the New\r\nDelhi Conference, is also a welcome step in our mutually\r\nenriching cooperation.\r\nA word about the interaction between the IPU and the\r\nUnited Nations. India has always believed that participation\r\nof members of Parliament — from both the Government\r\nand the opposition parties — in the meetings, conferences\r\nand summits of the United Nations is necessary to impart\r\nto the United Nations the diverse will of “we the peoples”\r\nthat the United Nations represents. Indian delegations to\r\nall regular and special sessions of the General Assembly,\r\nas well as to the conferences organized by the United\r\nNations, have included members of our Parliament. In\r\naddition, our Parliament also takes an active interest in\r\nthe deliberations of the international community in this\r\nforum and promotes national legislation for the social and\r\neconomic betterment of our people in line with\r\ninternational deliberations, in particular the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the IPU\r\nrequires for its continued success an effective, vibrant,\r\nmodern and reformed United Nations, responsive to the\r\nconcerns of the vast majority of its Members, the\r\ndeveloping countries. We are therefore supportive of the\r\nrecent measures that the international community is\r\nconsidering to revitalize and strengthen the United\r\nNations. However, reforms cannot be a substitute for the\r\nprovision of adequate resources to the United Nations to\r\ncarry out its mandated tasks. They cannot be simply a\r\ncost-cutting exercise. In this context, I recall that several\r\nconferences of the Inter-Parliamentary Union have called\r\non the international community to provide the United\r\nNations with the requisite financial, human and technical\r\nresources. We hope that these will soon be forthcoming.\r\nTo conclude, may I once again express my\r\ndelegation’s happiness at the present stage of cooperation\r\nbetween the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the United\r\nNations. I hope that this cooperation will be further\r\nintensified and strengthened in the coming years. India\r\nwill be willing to play its part in the process in the belief\r\nthat it is not only our endeavour and our commitment, but\r\nalso our duty, to strengthen a better and prosperous global\r\nsociety through strengthened international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. It is in this context that I commend to the\r\nAssembly the unanimous adoption of the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/52/L.9 and sponsored by a large\r\nnumber of our delegations.\r\nMr. Kasanda (Zambia): My delegation is a sponsor\r\nof the draft resolution on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In this regard,\r\nI endorse the statement made by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Spain as he introduced the draft\r\nresolution under consideration.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nLet me begin my brief intervention by expressing my\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for document\r\nA/52/456, which provides a clear account of the concrete\r\nactivities of cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union.\r\nWe can see from that report that the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union is actively promoting the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations at the\r\nregional, subregional and international levels. The Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, which is made up of elected\r\nrepresentatives of the peoples of the world, is, in a\r\nsignificant way, helping to bring the ideals of the United\r\nNations closer to the world communities. This is all the\r\nmore true given the fact that national delegations to various\r\nmeetings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union draw\r\nrepresentation from both governing and opposition parties.\r\nIn his concluding remarks in document A/52/456, the\r\nSecretary-General has rightly observed that the\r\nParliamentarians are a key group within the constituencies\r\nthat are acquiring growing importance to the United Nations\r\nand which warrant special consideration. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral goes on to conclude that the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion has a major role to play in the pursuit of the goals\r\nof the United Nations. Against that background, it is the\r\nhope of my delegation that the draft resolution before us\r\nwill meet with the unanimous approval of this Assembly.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is a privilege for me to take the floor in\r\nconnection with the draft resolution on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union in\r\nsupport of the advancement and deepening of a process that\r\nis opening up new prospects for international cooperation.\r\nMay I express the appreciation of my delegation to the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nand to the President of the Council of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, Mr. Miguel Ángel Martínez of Spain,\r\nfor their efforts to strengthen and intensify the relationship\r\nbetween the two organizations. I wish to extend this\r\nappreciation also to the Republic of Egypt for its continued\r\noutstanding contributions in that respect.\r\nThe signing of the agreement between the two\r\norganizations on 24 July 1996 made possible the\r\nestablishment of a definite starting point for a growing\r\ncooperation between both organizations, which will bring us\r\ncloser to the purposes and objectives of both organizations.\r\nThe goal is to embark on a path that will lead to the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations and contribute to the\r\nconsolidation of democracy within States — issues to\r\nwhich Argentina attaches special importance.\r\nIn that connection, we welcome the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, which outlines Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion support on important issues. This includes good\r\noffices in Cyprus and support for activities towards the\r\nworldwide prohibition of anti-personnel landmines. In the\r\nsphere of the promotion of democracy, we are pleased to\r\nnote that the Inter-Parliamentary Union has been\r\nproviding the United Nations with increasing support in\r\nthe form of technical assistance and advisory services for\r\nnational parliaments.\r\nSuch cooperation also encompasses follow-up to\r\nmajor United Nations conferences. The Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union participated in the preparations for\r\nand the holding of the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development and the 1997 meetings of\r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development. Based on\r\na 1996 study carried out by the IPU, the General\r\nAssembly has been given a worldwide assessment of\r\nparliamentary action on the implementation of Agenda 21.\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.9 is perfectly in keeping\r\nwith an international scenario geared towards the goals of\r\nrepresentative democracy and the parliamentary\r\nmovement. For all those reasons, Argentina has joined in\r\nsponsoring the draft resolution just introduced so lucidly\r\nand eloquently by the representative of Spain and\r\nsupported by the representatives of India and of Zambia.\r\nWe are convinced that in this way we can contribute to\r\nfurthering the common ideals that unite the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMr. Yakovlev (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The purposes set out in the statutes of the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) — to unite\r\nparliamentarians to secure the broad participation of\r\nStates in the strengthening of international peace and\r\nsecurity, in the firm establishment of representative\r\ninstitutions and in the defence of human rights — are\r\nlargely consonant with the aspirations of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe relationship between the two organizations is a\r\nlong-standing one. For years, IPU representatives have\r\ntaken an active part in major events of the United Nations\r\nand of bodies in the United Nations system. The annual\r\nNew York meetings of parliamentarians members of\r\ndelegations to the General Assembly have become a good\r\ntradition and have opened up a new dimension in the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\ndialogue with the United Nations. We applaud such\r\ncontacts at other major international events organized by the\r\nUnited Nations, such as the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, held at Cairo, the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, held at Copenhagen, and\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, held at Beijing.\r\nFeedback too is important; here I cite the increasing\r\nnumber of international and regional meetings of\r\nparliamentarians with the participation of specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations.\r\nThe cooperation agreement between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, signed in July\r\n1996, marked a new stage in the relationship between these\r\ntwo authoritative international organizations and gave\r\npowerful impetus to their efforts to improve and broaden\r\ntheir cooperation. This is particularly important given the\r\nongoing process of reform of the United Nations, one\r\nimportant area of which is the strengthening of cooperation\r\nbetween the Organization and civil society. The IPU can\r\nmake a contribution to this process as well.\r\nAmong the areas of practical interaction between the\r\ntwo organization is in the provision by the United Nations\r\nof technical assistance and consultative services to the\r\nnational parliaments of countries that require such\r\nassistance. The close contacts between the IPU and the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are\r\nbeginning to yield concrete results, and I note that the\r\nUNDP is providing financial support to the IPU for its\r\nprogrammes to encourage effective governance. We can\r\nexpect similar results in the light of recent agreements\r\nbetween the IPU and the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization and the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations. Human\r\nrights, the environment, drugs, armed conflict and other\r\nchallenges to State and individual security are the focus of\r\nattention both in the United Nations and in forums of the\r\nIPU.\r\nThe 100th Inter-Parliamentary Conference, to be held\r\nin 1998 in Russia, will be no exception. This is the first\r\ntime the Conference is being held in our country, and\r\nRussian parliamentarians expect important new initiatives\r\nto enhance links and cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the IPU. The fact that the Conference is to take\r\nplace on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption\r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be an\r\nimportant catalyst for ideas and proposals, in heightening\r\nour sense of responsibility for protecting the value of the\r\nhuman person, and in ensuring security for all individuals.\r\nThat was the thrust of the decisions taken at the recent\r\nCairo Inter-Parliamentary Conference.\r\nThe association of the IPU with the main areas of\r\nUnited Nations activities is having a good effect also on\r\nregional and subregional interaction among parliaments.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Assembly of the Commonwealth\r\nof Independent States (CIS), which meets regularly at\r\nSaint Petersburg, has provided experience in questions\r\nthat have taken on high priority for the United Nations.\r\nDespite its relative youth, the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nAssembly has proven itself as an active participant in\r\ninternational processes and as an organization that can\r\nmake a real contribution to resolving serious problems of\r\npeace and security, including efforts to eliminate pockets\r\nof tension in Abkhazia, the Transdniestr region and\r\nNagorny Karabakh.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Assembly of the CIS has\r\ndrawn up and adopted model procedural and executive\r\npenal codes and model legislation for combatting\r\norganized crime. This clearly shows that the CIS is\r\nimplementing the relevant recommendations of the United\r\nNations. The Inter-Parliamentary Assembly is establishing\r\nand developing contacts with other inter-parliamentary\r\norganizations such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the\r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the\r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe and the Nordic Council.\r\nSaint Petersburg, traditionally known as the northern\r\ncapital of Russia, is preparing to celebrate its 300th\r\nanniversary. It continues to play its historical role in\r\nbringing together peoples and cultures. Its citizens are not\r\nindifferent to efforts to combat one of the most terrible of\r\nthreats: the threat to the environment, one which is\r\ndifficult to discern at first but which is horrific in its\r\nconsequences. It requires the immediate formulation and\r\nimplementation of a whole set of measures that can\r\nprevent the destruction of all life on Earth.\r\nAs the Governor of Saint Petersburg, I wish to\r\ninform the Assembly of my city’s new “Green Helmets”\r\nprogramme, which includes the establishment of\r\nspecialized units to combat ecological dangers. This, we\r\nthink, is not only an urgent task, but also the moral duty\r\nof mankind.\r\nMs. Ramiro-Lopez (Philippines): Last year, during\r\nthe fifty-first session, the General Assembly adopted\r\nresolution 51/7 which, among other things, welcomed the\r\nconclusion on 24 July 1996 of the cooperation agreement\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion (IPU). That agreement brought to fruition the\r\nlongstanding desire of my Government, and that of others\r\nas well, to strengthen, increase and formalize cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU.\r\nThe cooperation agreement has proven to be an\r\nimportant step towards opening up new areas of\r\ncooperation, complementarity and mutually reinforcing\r\naction between the United Nations and the IPU to address\r\nglobal problems. It also reaffirms the IPU’s continuing\r\nsupport and affirmation of the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations, and the need to promote international\r\ncooperation in meeting the global challenges of humankind.\r\nIn this regard, the cooperation agreement has proven\r\nto be a catalyst for United Nations-IPU cooperation, as\r\nreflected in the report of the Secretary-General on this item\r\nwhich was requested in resolution 51/7. Cooperation has\r\nbeen expanded to key global issues such as international\r\npeace and security, promotion of representative democracy\r\nand follow-up to major United Nations conferences on\r\ndevelopment issues. The Philippines was particularly\r\npleased at the support given by the IPU to efforts to secure\r\na worldwide ban on anti-personnel mines.\r\nThe IPU, in its recent Cairo meeting, also adopted\r\nrecommendations for parliamentary action with regard to\r\nchild labour, commercial and other forms of sexual\r\nexploitation of children, and the protection of children in\r\narmed conflict. These will undoubtedly contribute to United\r\nNations and country efforts in combating these matters. The\r\nIPU, through various proposals and activities, has also\r\nreinforced United Nations efforts to promote the status of\r\nwomen and their participation in political life.\r\nThe recent actions I have cited serve as important\r\nillustrations of the fact that United Nations-IPU cooperation\r\nhas great potential in addressing key areas of global\r\nconcern.\r\nThe increasingly important role of civil society in\r\npromoting international cooperation should also be\r\npromoted through the vehicle of United Nations-IPU\r\ncooperation. For what better way can the will of the people\r\nbe expressed at the international level and in the United\r\nNations than through the IPU, which consists of\r\nrepresentatives elected by the people? At the same time,\r\nwhat better way than through the IPU is there of\r\ndisseminating issues considered by the United Nations to\r\nthe grassroots level? These are not rhetorical questions but,\r\nrather, a view that I hope will soon be injected into the\r\nmainstream discussions on global issues and problems.\r\nFinally, the Philippines strongly supports enhancing\r\nUnited Nations-IPU cooperation, and we recommend to\r\nthe General Assembly the adoption by consensus of the\r\ndraft resolution on this item, of which my country is a co-\r\nsponsor.\r\nMr. Park (Republic of Korea): It gives me great\r\npleasure to address agenda item 29, entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion”.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is an\r\norganization of national parliaments which represent their\r\npeople within the structure of a State. With its\r\nmembership of no less than 137 national parliaments from\r\nevery region of the world and a wide spectrum of\r\nlegislatures, the IPU represents a broad range of the\r\nworld’s collective public opinion.\r\nAs we all know, the members of national\r\nparliaments enact national laws and supervise the\r\nactivities of their Governments. As States become more\r\nand more interdependent, parliaments are playing an\r\nincreasingly important role in the formulation of national\r\nand foreign policies, including those dealing with\r\ninternational cooperation. They deliberate on treaties,\r\nincorporate international laws into the national legal\r\nsystem, and influence the conduct of their Governments’\r\nforeign policies.\r\nSince its foundation in 1889, the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion has made an invaluable contribution to the spread\r\nof representative democracy and the promotion of peace\r\nthroughout the world. Its activities have sought to\r\nmaintain peace, to strengthen democracy, and to promote\r\nhuman rights and freedoms, all of which are also the\r\ngoals of the United Nations.\r\nWith such like-minded objectives, my delegation\r\nbelieves it is only natural that the IPU and the United\r\nNations should seek closer cooperation with one another.\r\nTogether, both organizations carry enormous weight in\r\ninternational affairs, and closer coordination between them\r\nwill only improve their efficiency and their ability to\r\nreach those common goals.\r\nSince the parliamentarians are in constant contact\r\nwith the citizens they represent, we also believe that\r\ncloser United Nations-IPU collaboration can do much to\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nensure that the will of the people is clearly expressed at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nIn this respect, we are pleased to note that over the\r\npast year there has been considerable progress in the efforts\r\nof both organizations to seek closer ties of cooperation. We\r\nparticularly welcome the agreements reached by the IPU\r\nwith the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), as well as with the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), as\r\noutlined in the Secretary-General’s report (A/52/456). It is\r\nour hope that inter-institutional coordination can be further\r\nstrengthened through the conclusion of additional such\r\nagreements between the IPU and other members of the\r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nAs we are all aware, the United Nations is in the\r\nprocess of making strenuous efforts to adapt itself so as to\r\nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century more\r\neffectively. Last July, the Secretary-General put forward his\r\nproposals for United Nations reform in document A/51/950.\r\nIn that document, the Secretary-General emphasized that the\r\nparliamentarians are a key constituency of growing\r\nimportance to the United Nations.\r\nWe share that view, and we are convinced that\r\nnational parliamentarians working together at the\r\ninternational level have a major role to play in helping to\r\nrealize the goals of the United Nations. We believe that the\r\ninternational community should bear in mind the need for\r\nmobilizing the political will of parliamentarians as the\r\ndeliberations on United Nations reform continue.\r\nIn this context, it is worth noting that the 97th Inter-\r\nParliamentary Conference held last April in Seoul\r\nrecognized the need for national parliaments to support\r\nactions to be taken by the United Nations through its\r\nadoption of a resolution entitled “Cooperation for world and\r\nregional security and stability, as well as for respect for all\r\nforms of the sovereignty and independence of States”.\r\nFurthermore, as mentioned in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport contained in document A/52/456, many of the other\r\nresolutions adopted in Seoul — on sustainable development,\r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21, and regional conflicts —\r\nalso stressed the importance of cooperation between the\r\nIPU and the United Nations in dealing with pressing global\r\nissues.\r\nIndeed, the issue of cooperation between the IPU and\r\nthe United Nations was one of the underlying themes over\r\nthe course of the one week session of the 97th Inter-\r\nParliamentary Conference, which brought together in\r\nSeoul 572 members of parliament from 118 countries and\r\nrepresentatives from 25 observer delegations. We\r\nwelcome the clear statements made by both the United\r\nNations and the IPU of their intentions to strengthen the\r\ncooperation between them, and we look forward to those\r\nintentions coming to full fruition.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to sponsor the draft\r\nresolution on “Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union”. We look forward to\r\nits adoption by consensus by the General Assembly.\r\nFinally, allow me to take this opportunity to express my\r\nsincere appreciation to the delegation of Spain for the\r\nleading role it has played in submitting this important\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nMrs. Ben Yedder (Tunisia) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Since its establishment at a difficult period of\r\ntime, the United Nations has worked tirelessly for peace.\r\nIt has also helped to pave the way for national liberation\r\nmovements in every region of the world. It has directed\r\nmuch of its work towards economic and social\r\ndevelopment and the improvement of standards of living.\r\nIn order better to respond to the demands of the\r\ninternational community, the United Nations has\r\nconstantly reformed itself in order to discharge its lofty\r\nmission as an agent for change and progress for the\r\nnations and peoples of the world.\r\nThe aspiration to universality and the all-\r\nencompassing nature of the mandate of the United\r\nNations make it a unique and indispensable forum, giving\r\nGovernments the opportunity of working together to\r\nundertake common endeavours to mobilize the energies\r\nand resources necessary to implement the actions agreed\r\nupon. The power of the Organization to bring people\r\ntogether has produced outstanding results in the most\r\ndiverse areas, including trade and development, the\r\nenvironment, human rights, the progressive development\r\nand codification of international law, equality of the sexes\r\nand equality within the population, peace and security,\r\nand disarmament.\r\nThe Organization has strengthened its presence\r\nthrough the creation of specialized bodies on which it has\r\nconferred a responsibility to support international efforts\r\nto combat illiteracy, poverty and disease, thereby\r\nconsolidating the foundations of international peace and\r\ncooperation and opening up the best routes to bring\r\nprogress in all its dimensions within reach of all the\r\npeoples who seek it. This approach has been reflected in\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nthe conventions, acts and agreements that the United\r\nNations has brought about in various fields, with a variety\r\nof intergovernmental organizations, international institutions\r\nand regional organizations.\r\nIt is in this context that I pay tribute to the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union for the\r\ncooperation agreement concluded by them less than two\r\nyears ago, on 24 July 1996. Our consideration of agenda\r\nitem 29 on cooperation between this intergovernmental\r\norganization — the Inter-Parliamentary Union — and the\r\nuniversal Organization gives me a welcome opportunity to\r\nrefer in this Assembly to some of the positive steps taken\r\nby both organizations in this framework in the domains of\r\nthe promotion of peace and security, the promotion of\r\nrepresentative democracy and, finally, the follow-up to\r\nmajor United Nations conferences.\r\nWith regard to the promotion of peace and security,\r\nthe first aspect to which I will refer relates to the\r\nsubstantive contribution of the IPU to United Nations\r\nefforts for a global ban on anti-personnel landmines. To\r\nthat end, throughout 1996 and this year, the IPU has\r\nconsidered the steps it might take to help ban these mines\r\nand conclude a treaty binding on all States members in this\r\narea. The IPU has also continued its efforts at the\r\nparliamentary level to help in the pacification and\r\nnormalization of conflict situations in many countries where\r\ncivil peace has been seriously disrupted, whether in Albania\r\nor the countries of Africa, particularly in the Great Lakes\r\nregion.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union has at the same time\r\ncontinued, as in the past, closely to follow the situation in\r\nCyprus. But the area in which the IPU has made the most\r\nobvious contribution is doubtless that of the promotion of\r\nrepresentative democracy. To this effect, the Union has\r\nbeen cooperating by providing technical assistance to the\r\nUnited Nations to help the parliaments of developing\r\ncountries to strengthen their structures, in Africa as well as\r\nin Asia and Latin America. In 1997, together with the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the IPU\r\nsponsored a Parliamentarians’ Forum that brought together\r\nmembers of parliaments from some 75 countries. At its last\r\ngeneral conference, which was held in Cairo from 11 to 16\r\nSeptember 1997, the Union contributed to the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Specifically,\r\nthis took the form of a resolution calling for measures to\r\nprovide support to the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. This text also called upon\r\nparliaments to ensure the ratification of international and\r\nregional human rights instruments. The parliamentarians\r\nundertook to work to harmonize national legislation with\r\nthe standards contained in international instruments with\r\na view to their full implementation.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Conference in Cairo\r\nprovided a good opportunity to adopt recommendations to\r\nprotect children in armed conflicts. The focus of the\r\nmeeting was directed to important questions relating to\r\nchildren, such as child labour and the exploitation of\r\nchildren. In the same crucial area of the promotion of\r\nrepresentative democracy, the IPU has also just adopted\r\na Universal Declaration on Democracy. This sets out the\r\nbasic principles of democracy, as well as standards for the\r\nexercise of democratic government.\r\nThe third area on which parliamentarians focused\r\ntheir interest in 1997 was that of follow-up to major\r\nUnited Nations conferences. I am pleased to note in this\r\nregard that the activities of national parliaments in this\r\narea are in keeping with the focus of the United Nations.\r\nIndeed, at its nineteenth special session, devoted to the\r\nconsideration of Agenda 21, the General Assembly\r\nstressed that in order to promote participatory processes\r\nin the area of economic and social development, the\r\nparticipation of national legislative assemblies was\r\nindispensable. In this area, we can only welcome the\r\ncontribution made by parliamentarians at the 1992\r\nConference on Environment and Development, and the\r\nvarious events that resulted from it. In 1996, the United\r\nNations and the IPU took joint measures to follow up and\r\nimplement the texts that emerged from the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development. To this end, in September 1996,\r\nUNDP and the IPU organized a meeting in New York\r\nduring which participants identified priority measures to\r\naddress poverty eradication, the attainment of full\r\nemployment and social integration.\r\nAnother important area I should like to mention is\r\nthe promotion of women and the participation of women\r\nin political life. Parliamentarians played an active role\r\nduring the preparatory work for the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women, with many activities, focusing on,\r\ninter alia, the participation of women in political parties\r\nand electoral processes and their role in national\r\nparliaments.\r\nMore recently, on the occasion of the World Food\r\nSummit in 1997, the Inter-Parliamentary Union held a\r\nParliamentarians’ Day meeting, organized jointly with the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n(FAO). It dealt basically with the lack of food security, its\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nroot causes and follow-up to the outcome of the Summit.\r\nThe Union adopted a Declaration in support of the Summit\r\nand announced that it intended to set up a mechanism for\r\nparliamentary follow-up of the commitments made in\r\nRome.\r\nThe increasingly active participation by parliamentary\r\nrepresentatives in international affairs, which I have already\r\noutlined, is constantly gaining strength and being reinforced\r\nalong the lines established by the United Nations in order\r\nto lend new impetus to the participation of civil society in\r\ninternational activities. This interest is reflected in a\r\ntangible way through the resolutions adopted by the IPU at\r\nits recent Cairo session — resolutions which cover the\r\nstrengthening of links between parliament and the people to\r\nensure sustainable democracy and subjects as diverse and\r\ncrucial as jobs and globalization, the protection of children,\r\nthe principles and elements of universal democracy and the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nMy country is proud to take an active part in the work\r\nof the IPU. We strongly support cooperation between it and\r\nthe United Nations, and we are happy today to see the new\r\ndynamism that the Union has given to its relationship with\r\nthe United Nations family, a dynamism reflected in the\r\nincrease in cooperation agreements between the IPU and\r\nthe specialized agencies. I refer here to the recent\r\nagreements concluded with the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n(FAO).\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s statement in his\r\nreport on cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union that national parliaments through\r\nthe IPU\r\n“have a major role to play in the pursuit of the goals\r\nof the United Nations” (A/52/456, para. 20).\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): Italy is among the sponsors of the\r\ndraft resolution before us, and wishes to add its voice to\r\nthose who have already expressed strong support for this\r\ndocument. The draft notes with appreciation the increased\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU), and recommends that this\r\ncooperation be further strengthened at a time when the\r\nUnited Nations is preparing to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century. The Permanent Representative of\r\nSpain, Ambassador Inocencio Arias, introduced the draft\r\nresolution in the most clear and comprehensive way. We\r\nare particularly grateful to him for having succeeded in\r\ncollecting about a hundred sponsors — 15 more than last\r\nyear. Given this high, extraordinarily large number of\r\nsponsors, we are confident that the General Assembly will\r\nadopt the draft resolution by consensus.\r\nThe report (A/52/456) of the Secretary-General,\r\nsubmitted pursuant to last year’s resolution, indicates that\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the IPU has\r\nbeen even more strengthened since the conclusion of the\r\ncooperation agreement on 24 July 1996. The report also\r\ngives several examples where the two organizations now\r\nundertake joint and mutually reinforcing action,\r\nparticularly in the fields of the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity, promotion of representative democracy and\r\nfollow-up to major United Nations Conferences. Italy\r\nwelcomes these developments. National parliaments are\r\ncalled on to play an ever- increasing role in international\r\ncooperation. We must never forget that the ideals of\r\ndemocracy that Parliaments embody should inspire and\r\ngovern relations not only within States, but also between\r\nStates. Italy is particularly attached to this value, and sees\r\nthe IPU as a key organization in affirming democracy in\r\ntoday’s international community, as well as, of course,\r\nwithin the United Nations system.\r\nWe note with deep appreciation the results of the\r\nIPU Conference held in Seoul in April 1997. On that\r\noccasion, the IPU adopted a number of important\r\nresolutions dealing with United Nations matters, in\r\nparticular, security issues and emergency situations, such\r\nas those prevailing at the time in Albania and the then\r\nZaire. Moreover, we would like to praise the IPU’s\r\nsupport for the campaign to secure a worldwide ban on\r\nanti-personnel landmines.\r\nWith regard to the promotion of representative\r\ndemocracy, the cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the IPU has already produced highly significant\r\nresults, especially in the areas of the participation of\r\nwomen in political life — and we were delighted that\r\nseveral ladies addressed the Assembly today — provision\r\nof technical assistance and advisory services to\r\nparliaments, good governance and the protection of\r\nhuman rights. In this latter respect, the IPU meeting in\r\nCairo last September was particularly important, since it\r\nset the basis for concrete initiatives aimed at ensuring\r\nprompt ratification by parliaments of international and\r\nregional human rights treaties, national implementation of\r\ninternational human rights standards and the protection of\r\nchildren. Moreover, the IPU adopted in Cairo a Universal\r\nDeclaration on Democracy, which contains the basic\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nelements for the exercise of democratic government, and\r\naddresses the international dimension of democracy.\r\nThe record of the Inter-Parliamentary Union on the\r\nfollow-up to major United Nations conferences is equally\r\nimpressive. It shows how much the cooperation between the\r\nIPU and the United Nations can benefit both institutions.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General recalls the various IPU\r\ninitiatives aimed at fostering the implementation of the\r\nresults of the 1992 Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment, the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, and the 1997\r\nWorld Food Summit, held in Rome. Parliaments were\r\nencouraged to adopt legislation to comply with the\r\ncommitments made at these conferences, and mechanisms\r\nwere set up to monitor parliamentary action in the areas\r\nconcerned. Needless to say, this is an invaluable\r\ncontribution by the IPU to United Nations activities and,\r\nultimately, to reaffirming and implementing the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the full support\r\nof Italy for the action of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and\r\nthe further increase of its cooperation with the United\r\nNations, based on last year’s agreement. The ideals of\r\nfreedom and democracy, of which parliaments are the\r\nhighest expression, remain the best guarantee of this\r\npartnership’s lasting success.\r\nMr. Elbaradei (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nFor the third year in a row, the General Assembly is\r\ndebating agenda item 29, “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union”, in order to\r\nconsider the contributions that have been and will be made\r\nby the two organizations. The aim is to promote this\r\ncooperation so as to ensure active participation by all\r\nparliaments in supporting the United Nations in all its fields\r\nof activity, whether political, social or humanitarian, as well\r\nas in peacekeeping operations, preventive diplomacy and\r\npost-conflict peace-building.\r\nI am pleased to congratulate Mr. Miguel Ángel\r\nMartínez on his election as President of the IPU Council\r\nduring the successful IPU Council meeting held in Cairo.\r\nI wish him success in his presidency, and hope he will\r\nachieve optimum cooperation between the IPU and the\r\nUnited Nations. I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Ahmed\r\nSorour, Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament, for his\r\nconstructive efforts during his term of office as President of\r\nthe IPU Council in supporting its activities, and especially\r\nfor his initiative of laying down the cornerstone for\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the IPU —\r\nthe subject we are considering today.\r\nFurthermore, I wish to recognize the untiring efforts\r\nof Mr. Pierre Cornillon, Secretary-General of the IPU, to\r\nenhance the performance of the IPU and to expand and\r\ndeepen its cooperation with the United Nations system.\r\nIn its resolution 51/7 of 25 October 1996, the\r\nGeneral Assembly welcomed the cooperation agreement\r\nconcluded between the United Nations and the IPU and\r\nconsidered that the signature of the agreement represented\r\nan important step for increased and strengthened\r\ncooperation between the two organizations. The report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on this item (document A/52/456)\r\nshows that cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe IPU has been strengthened since the conclusion of the\r\ncooperation agreement, and the ensuing period has\r\nwitnessed several examples where the two organizations\r\nnow undertake joint and mutually reinforcing action.\r\nBefore I speak to the substantive aspects of the\r\nreport, I wish to express the appreciation of the delegation\r\nof Egypt to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his comprehensive report on this\r\nitem, and for his unremitting efforts towards promoting\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the IPU. Let\r\nme pay tribute as well to the efforts made by his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to develop the\r\ngeneral framework of this cooperation through the\r\nagreement on cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nDuring the Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in\r\nSeoul in April this year, discussions were held on security\r\nmatters in general and their relation to the promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security, and on emergency cases\r\nin Albania and the then Zaire, the Cyprus problem,\r\npeacekeeping operations in Haiti and the global banning\r\nof anti-personnel landmines. These are all vivid examples\r\nof the potentialities of effective cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations. Since the IPU has taken the initiative\r\nto discuss these issues and has lent its support to the\r\nUnited Nations in these areas, in our view it is important\r\nthat the IPU continue to support the United Nations with\r\nregard to other issues, especially those chronic problems\r\nwhere conflicts within a single nation preclude the United\r\nNations from playing its due role — in Afghanistan and\r\nSomalia, for example — and other issues. Such issues\r\nwould undoubtedly benefit from participation by the\r\nparliamentarians in their settlement and thereby facilitate\r\nthe role of the United Nations in the performance of its\r\nmandate.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nIn the same context, the adoption by the IPU\r\nConference held in Cairo in September 1997 of five major\r\ndocuments aimed at supporting the activities of the United\r\nNations is a move that stresses the concept of cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations. The Universal Declaration\r\non Democracy, based on a joint study conducted by the\r\nIPU, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and a panel of international\r\nexperts, is indeed an inter-parliamentary precedent that\r\ndeserves to be built on. The same goes for the adoption by\r\nthe IPU Council of resolutions recommending parliamentary\r\naction to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The IPU has\r\ncalled upon parliaments to provide support to the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and also\r\nrecommends parliamentary action regarding child labour,\r\ncommercial as well as sexual exploitation of children, and\r\nthe protection of children in armed conflict. All of these\r\nresolutions are geared towards supporting the activities of\r\nthe United Nations in these areas.\r\nThe efforts by the IPU in the areas of environment,\r\ndevelopment, food and agriculture, social development, and\r\nthe advancement of women also show that we are\r\nembarking upon a broad array of areas of cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations. Such cooperation should be\r\nstrengthened and utilized with a view to the attainment of\r\nthe common goals of the two organizations.\r\nLast year, we participated in the IPU meeting held at\r\nthe time of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly\r\nof the United Nations. A key theme was the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations in the promotion of democracy.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe IPU held another meeting last July on sound\r\nmanagement in the interests of democracy and justice. If by\r\nour presence here we stand as clear symbols of democratic\r\naction in all our countries, it would indeed be difficult for\r\nus to speak of these issues that relate to democracy when\r\nwe feel that the place that is acting as host to our meeting,\r\nwhich represents all nations of the world, itself lacks\r\ndemocratic practices, especially in one of its primary\r\nbodies, namely, the Security Council. Here, we are have\r\nserious concern with regard to some of its resolutions,\r\nresolutions that lack the criteria of democracy owing either\r\nto the lack of balanced representation of all the world’s\r\ncontinents, or to the use of the veto power which we have\r\nseen exercised or threatened, counter to the unanimity\r\namong other Council members.\r\nWe all know that the United Nations has no power\r\nto act other than within the provisions of its Charter. We\r\ntherefore call on all Member States to seriously consider\r\nthe possibility of amending the Charter in order to\r\nconform to the international circumstances of today which\r\ndiverge completely from those which prevailed at the time\r\nof adopting the present Charter. Such amendment would\r\nserve to put an end to the frustrations felt by the peoples\r\nof the world who find that practices which are devoid of\r\ndemocratic norms rob of their substance the noble goals\r\naround which they have rallied to establish the United\r\nNations. Consequently, the credibility of the decisions and\r\nperformances of the United Nations, the largest of\r\ninternational organizations, will be missing.\r\nFurthermore, we, as parliamentarians, view with\r\ngrave concern the non-implementation of the principles\r\nand standards provided by the United Nations Charter\r\nwith regard to breaches of international peace and\r\nsecurity, in a manner characterized by justice and\r\nobjectivity, that is without applying selectivity and double\r\nstandards in dealing with similar cases. This is one of the\r\nextremely sore points that have harmed the credibility of\r\nthe international Organization over the past few years. We\r\nare aware that the challenges facing the United Nations\r\nhave recently multiplied and diversified. In addition to\r\ninternational instability in the economic, social,\r\nhumanitarian and environmental spheres, there is an\r\nincrease in areas of tension and conflict both among\r\nStates and within States. Outbreaks of ethnic, tribal and\r\nfactional conflicts, the heightened threats of the weapons\r\nof mass destruction, the spread of terrorism and the\r\nincrease of its scope, as an international phenomenon —\r\nall endanger democracy, human rights and international\r\npeace and security.\r\nGiven that proliferation of challenges, the\r\nparliaments of the world must manifest their concern with\r\nthe issues on the agenda of the United Nations, such as\r\ndisarmament, development, the protection of women and\r\nchildren, the protection of the environment, as well as\r\nspecial problems relating to reform of the United Nations\r\nand the ways and means for Governments to contribute to\r\ndealing with those problems.\r\nIn addition, it is incumbent upon parliaments of\r\nStates that have not fully paid their financial obligations\r\nto the United Nations to take action aimed at the\r\nfulfilment of these obligations on time and without\r\nconditions, so that the United Nations may carry out its\r\ntasks.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nMoreover, I specifically propose that “challenges\r\nfacing the United Nations and how to deal with them” be\r\nthe topic of discussions in all the world parliaments this\r\nyear. This would cause members of these parliaments to\r\npress their Governments to make additional efforts to assist\r\nin facing these challenges. Such a debate would undeniably\r\nhave great importance in strengthening public opinion in\r\nfavour of United Nations efforts aimed at the attainment of\r\nits goals.\r\nThe Egyptian Parliament recognizes the importance of\r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations in all areas of\r\nits operations. Notwithstanding the concerns I have\r\nexpressed with regard to certain aspects of the United\r\nNations work as members of the Egyptian Parliament, we\r\nshall always stand squarely behind all efforts aimed at\r\nenhancing the United Nations effectiveness and making it\r\nmore democratic.\r\nMs. Tan (Singapore): It is an honour for me to speak\r\non behalf of the Singapore delegation on this agenda item,\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union”. At the outset, my delegation would\r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport (A/52/456). I would also like to thank Mr. Inocencio\r\nArias of Spain for introducing draft resolution A/52/L.9.\r\nMore than a year after the signing of the cooperation\r\nagreement between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU) on 24 July 1996, my delegation\r\nis pleased to note that significant progress has been made\r\nin strengthening the cooperation between the two\r\norganizations. The list of concrete steps and actions\r\nelaborated in the Secretary-General’s report on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU is impressive. We\r\nare especially pleased that cooperation has extended to\r\naction in favour of the participation of women in political\r\nlife, which is at the core of the IPU’s work to promote\r\nrepresentative democracy. Another new area of cooperation\r\nwhich we welcome is the increasing support received by the\r\nUnited Nations from the IPU in the provision of technical\r\nassistance and advisory services to parliaments at the\r\nrequest of national Governments.\r\nAs the IPU is an organization with a membership of\r\n135 national parliaments, it is not surprising that it has\r\nsought closer participation with the United Nations. The ties\r\nbetween the two organizations, particularly in the areas of\r\npeace, human rights and democracy, date back to the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations itself. On the basis of\r\nthe shared objectives of the United Nations and the IPU,\r\ncloser cooperation would only facilitate the work of\r\nparliamentarians and empower the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe key to United Nations-IPU cooperation is\r\ncomplementarity. The United Nations recognizes that it is\r\nnot a world government. After all, its mandates are\r\ndetermined and its resources furnished by its Member\r\nStates. Yet the United Nations has successfully\r\nestablished international law and set international\r\nstandards and programmes in almost every field of human\r\nconduct.\r\nHowever, sovereign power remains with individual\r\nnation States. Within nation States, decisions hitherto\r\nmade by the Executive increasingly need the endorsement\r\nof the elected representatives of the people. The views of\r\nthe people can no longer be ignored. The member\r\nnational parliaments of the IPU, therefore, decide for their\r\nrespective nations whether to assume binding international\r\nobligations and how to implement at the national level the\r\ndecisions which States have taken at the international\r\nlevel. In my delegation’s view, the task of exercising\r\nsovereign power should only be exercised by\r\nparliamentarians, that is, men and women elected by the\r\npeople of each nation, those who are in direct contact\r\nwith the general population, who are in touch with their\r\nshared aspirations and understand their common interests\r\nand needs.\r\nOne area where the active participation of\r\nparliamentarians is needed is in the debate on the\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations. In preparing the\r\nUnited Nations for the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury and in support of the Secretary-General’s reform\r\npackage, the financial problems of the United Nations\r\nneed to be addressed with great urgency. It has been\r\nrepeated time and again that the key reason for this is the\r\nfailure of some Member States to pay their dues in full\r\nand on time. One reason that has been offered for the\r\ninability of Member States to fulfil their financial\r\nobligations to the United Nations is that domestic political\r\nbodies do not support their current share of the United\r\nNations budget. We believe that through greater contact\r\nand collaboration between the United Nations and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union parliamentarians will be in a\r\nbetter position to explain to the public the issues involved\r\nso as to garner popular support for international action.\r\nThis would address the problem of justifying the\r\nresources needed for international cooperation through the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nThe IPU’s increased participation and collaboration\r\nwith the United Nations would make the United Nations\r\nmore representative, as the parliaments represent the will of\r\nthe people of every nation. We believe that it is only\r\nthrough a productive collaborative relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and the IPU that the will of the people can\r\nbe better expressed at the international level through the\r\nUnited Nations — and, conversely, through the IPU, the\r\nvoice of the intergovernmental process can be disseminated\r\nto the grass-roots level. This is a win-win situation that we\r\nfully support and encourage.\r\nIn closing, my delegation is pleased to announce its\r\ndecision to sponsor draft resolution A/52/L.9 and commend\r\nto the Assembly that the draft be unanimously adopted.\r\nMr. Ghafoor (Pakistan): The Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion (IPU) and the United Nations share a common\r\ninterest in collective efforts for the realization of the lofty\r\nideals of the United Nations Charter.\r\nToday, the United Nations stands at the crossroads of\r\nits history. During the first half century of its existence, the\r\nOrganization saw many ups and downs. It now confronts\r\nmajor challenges as it prepares itself for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe United Nations is entitled to take pride in making\r\ninvaluable contributions in a number of crucial areas, such\r\nas peacekeeping, economic development, humanitarian\r\nassistance and the establishment of legal norms. However,\r\nit is disheartening to see that this world Organization has\r\nnot been able to live up to the expectations of the people of\r\nthe world.\r\nDespite its shortcomings, the United Nations remains\r\nthe beacon of hopes and aspirations for people all over the\r\nworld. The people continue to look up to the United\r\nNations in their quest not only to rid the world of the\r\nscourge of war, but also to create the economic, social and\r\nhuman conditions under which all human beings can aspire\r\nto better standards of life in greater freedom.\r\nAs a representative body of the people of the world,\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union has an important role to play\r\nin the realization of a world free of the scourge of war,\r\nhunger, poverty and disease. To achieve this goal, the IPU\r\nand the United Nations should actively and fully utilize the\r\nframework for cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nParliamentarians can sensitize the United Nations\r\nabout the expectations of the people they represent. For\r\nsome, the United Nations has not achieved the goal of\r\npeace and security and stability. In certain regions of the\r\nworld, it has not been successful in ameliorating the\r\npeople’s sufferings. Lack of action in Bosnia reinforced\r\ndoubts about the ability of the Organization in dealing\r\nwith conflicts.\r\nIn our own region, the Kashmir dispute is still\r\nsimmering. The people of Kashmir are still waiting for\r\nthe United Nations to take measures to implement\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nAt this juncture, when the United Nations is\r\npreparing to meet the challenges of the future,\r\ncooperation between the Inter-Parliamentary Union and\r\nthe United Nations can help in realizing the hopes and\r\naspirations of the people of the world. Close cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations will greatly help in\r\nharnessing the power of the people for the realization of\r\nthe objectives of the United Nations. It is, therefore,\r\nnecessary that parliamentarians from all countries launch\r\ncampaigns to create awareness among their constituencies\r\nabout the role of the United Nations in today’s world.\r\nA major change over the past 50 years lies in the\r\ngrowth of civil society. The citizens of the world are\r\nincreasingly interacting with one another on matters of\r\ninternational significance. To respond to the wishes of the\r\npeople, the United Nations needs to become more\r\naccessible to these new actors, such as non-governmental\r\norganizations, who represent civil society. Pakistan for its\r\npart will continue to make contributions towards\r\nenhancing and expanding the interaction between the\r\nUnited Nations and civil society.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union is uniquely placed to\r\nbuild bridges between the United Nations and civil\r\nsociety. The IPU can mobilize public opinion in favour of\r\nthe United Nations. It can also contribute to the United\r\nNations role in the promotion of democracy, socio-\r\neconomic development, peacekeeping and peace-building.\r\nIn the field of peacekeeping and peace-building, the\r\nparliamentarians of major troop-contributing countries\r\nmight consider the establishment of an IPU forum on\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations that can mobilize\r\ninternational public opinion in support of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping endeavours.\r\nAs the United Nations prepares for the twenty-first\r\ncentury, a major challenge facing the Organization is to\r\ntake full advantage of the revolution in informatics. The\r\nSecretary-General is to be commended for giving due\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\npriority to this task, which deserves the full support of the\r\nparliamentarians and the entire international community.\r\nThe informatics revolution is indeed the revolution of our\r\ntimes and the greatest hope as a force multiplier at the\r\nservice of development. In this regard, Pakistan takes pride\r\nin having been of assistance in moving the United Nations\r\nand its Member States further along the path of informatics\r\nand cyberspace.\r\nIn recent years, the United Nations has come under\r\ncritical examination. Every organization needs constant\r\nreview and self-examination and reform. The United\r\nNations needs this perhaps more than any other\r\norganization, because it crystallizes within itself the hopes\r\nand aspirations of humanity. One must, however, keep in\r\nmind that reform of the United Nations cannot be hasty or\r\nill-considered, nor can it be based on anything other than\r\nthe broadest consensus.\r\nThe people of the world have a vested interest in the\r\nrealization of the lofty ideals of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Together they can succeed. Let history not say that\r\nthe people of the world who created this Organization did\r\nnot measure up to the task of preparing it for the challenges\r\nof the future.\r\nMr. Biørn Lian (Norway): I am honoured to address\r\nthe General Assembly on the important item of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion (IPU). The basis for this cooperation is the\r\nagreement between the two organizations signed last year.\r\nThat agreement provides a very useful platform for the\r\ninvolvement of parliaments in the work of the United\r\nNations. I am pleased, in this connection, to be able to refer\r\nto the active role played by the Norwegian Parliament and\r\nthe parliaments in the other Nordic countries in facilitating\r\nand promoting an active role for parliaments and for IPU\r\nthrough the cooperation agreement.\r\nMy Government has noted with great interest and\r\nsatisfaction the emphasis in the reform proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General on the need to involve civil society, in its\r\nbroadest sense, more actively in the work of the United\r\nNations and we look forward to an exchange of views on\r\nhow this can be achieved.\r\nThe impact of the work of the United Nations can\r\nclearly be enhanced by parliaments’ playing an active role\r\nin advancing issues of international concern. The\r\ncooperation agreement reflects a promising development:\r\nthe growing importance of parliaments in shaping the global\r\nagenda, inter alia, on such urgent issues as human rights,\r\ndemocratization, good governance and electoral\r\nassistance, to mention but a few. In this connection, as a\r\nvery concrete example, I would like to highlight one area\r\nwhere parliamentarians have played a decisive role: the\r\nefforts to achieve a ban on anti-personnel landmines. It is\r\nin no small measure thanks to their efforts — the efforts\r\nof parliaments — that a number of countries, including\r\nmy own, have been able to spearhead a process that will\r\nculminate in the signing, in Ottawa in December, of a\r\nconvention to ban anti-personnel landmines.\r\nThe role of parliaments in all these areas is clear.\r\nThey can pass legislation and allocate resources in\r\nsupport of such legislation. The United Nations provides\r\nvast opportunities for the sharing of experience and\r\nexpertise and contributes to strengthening the role of\r\nparliaments in the collective efforts of the United Nations.\r\nMy Government hopes that the cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union will\r\nbe strengthened in the future and that the work of both\r\norganizations will be geared towards maximizing the\r\npotential benefit to both organizations of this cooperation.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra): As one of the\r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/52/L.9, it is my pleasure\r\ntoday to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nhis personal interest in the issue of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union\r\n(IPU).\r\nIndeed, as a country whose Parliament, the Consell\r\nde la Terra, now the Consell General, goes back to the\r\nyear 1419 — and is thus one of the oldest parliaments in\r\nthe world — Andorra is particularly keen on fostering the\r\ncollaboration between national parliaments and the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe process of reform of the United Nations is\r\ngeared towards taking our Organization closer to the\r\npeople. In order for the representatives of the people to be\r\ninformed regularly of what happens at the United Nations,\r\nso that they can help and support the actions of the\r\nOrganization, we need more contact of all sorts between\r\nour respective parliaments and the Organization. Of\r\ncourse, national Governments must do their share, but\r\ninitiatives that can enhance dialogue between parliaments\r\nand the United Nations are not only necessary but\r\nessential.\r\nAndorra applauds, as it did last year, the cooperation\r\nagreement between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nParliamentary Union, concluded on 24 July 1996. My\r\ncountry, which counts four parliamentarians as advisors in\r\nits delegation to the General Assembly at its fifty-second\r\nsession, will live, I can assure the Assembly, by the letter\r\nand the spirit of that agreement, in the firm conviction that\r\nonly a deeper understanding by parliaments of the goals and\r\ninner workings of the United Nations will favour a true\r\nreform of the Organization and our ability, in the end, to\r\nreach the peoples we represent — the peoples mentioned at\r\nthe opening of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nAllow me also to commend General Assembly\r\nPresident Hennadiy Udovenko on his personal presence\r\nhere earlier today, which marks his commitment to the aims\r\nof draft resolution A/52/L.9. Allow me, since this is the\r\nfirst time at the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly that I am taking the floor here, to congratulate\r\nhim and you, Sir, on the assumption of your functions and\r\nto assure you of the Andorran support for your task during\r\nthe period 1997-1998.\r\nI wish also congratulate Mr. Miguel Ángel Martínez,\r\nrecently elected President of the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nCouncil, for his new responsibilities. His illustrious record\r\nwhile at the Council of Europe vouches for a very\r\nsuccessful mandate. I would also like to put in a good word\r\nfor Mr. Pierre Cornillon, Secretary-General of IPU, who\r\nhas always had it in heart to bring the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion closer to the United Nations. I believe that\r\nMr. Cornillon is a witness to the commitment of the\r\nAndorran Parliament to IPU since its acceptance into the\r\norganization.\r\nAt the United Nations, human rights and development\r\nare central. Who is better qualified to promote, bring about\r\nand implement these goals than national parliaments, as\r\nlegitimate and democratic emanations of the peoples’ will\r\nand as final arbiters of budget allocations that will have\r\nclear repercussions for options of economic development?\r\nWe can only gain by a closer cooperation on these issues\r\nbetween parliaments and Governments, between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Let us approve\r\nby consensus draft resolution A/52/L.9.\r\nMr. Cherginets (Belarus) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): The Republic of Belarus, a founding Member of\r\nthe United Nations and a member of the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion (IPU), is a sponsor of the draft resolution on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and IPU.\r\nIn the implementation of this draft resolution, we feel\r\nthat a central element is the great opportunity it offers to\r\ncoordinate the efforts of the United Nations and the\r\nparliaments of the countries of the world to resolve the\r\nglobal problems confronting the international community.\r\nWe hope that this cooperation will facilitate the search for\r\nsolutions to problems facing our countries, in particular in\r\neliminating the consequences of the unprecedented\r\ndisaster of the Chernobyl nuclear power-plant accident,\r\nwhich was equivalent to the detonation of 50 atomic\r\nbombs. The Republic of Belarus is now obliged to spend\r\na third of its yearly budget to eliminate the consequences\r\nof this terrible disaster every year. We understand that our\r\nefforts in eliminating the possible consequences will also\r\ndetermine the security of peoples in neighbouring States.\r\nThis is why both our Parliament and our President are\r\nsparing no efforts in this area.\r\nAs is well known, one of the features of\r\ninternational organizations is that the effectiveness of their\r\nactions depends to a significant extent upon how\r\nadequately they reflect the realities of our modern world.\r\nIn our relationship with other States we accord\r\ninternational organizations and institutions a special role,\r\nas we believe in the full participation of Belarus in\r\nmultilateral cooperation, whether interaction between\r\ninter-parliamentary and political structures, economic\r\ninstitutions or mechanisms for social stabilization. An\r\nimportant external precondition to this is the successful\r\ndevelopment of democratic processes and market reforms\r\nin our country.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus is prepared to give all kinds\r\nof assistance for the creation of favourable conditions for\r\nfruitful cooperation between such eminent international\r\norganizations as the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. To this end we are prepared to\r\nconsider the possibility at the appropriate time of hosting\r\none of the joint events under the aegis of the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union in our country\r\nto discuss the problems that confront the countries of our\r\nregion, including the prevention of ecological\r\ncatastrophes, the fight against organized crime,\r\nsmuggling, drug trafficking, the prevention of regional\r\nconflicts, and the resolution of other questions.\r\nI am sure you will agree that the holding of a\r\nsummit of this kind would be a real contribution to the\r\norganization of the United Nations-IPU joint cooperation\r\nprogramme. The organization of the programme would\r\nthus also result in interaction among specific States.\r\nWe call upon the General Assembly to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution before it (A/52/L.9) by consensus.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 37th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 28 October 1997\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.9. Before we proceed, however, I\r\nshould like to announce that the following States have\r\njoined the co-sponsors of the draft resolution: Benin,\r\nGuinea, Guyana, Israel, Mali, the Marshall Islands and\r\nNepal.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/52/L.9?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 52/7).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly\r\nto conclude its consideration of agenda item 29?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.\r\n16\r\n"
