(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work\r\nRequest for the inclusion of an additional item\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/52/234)\r\nThe President: In his note circulated in document\r\nA/52/234, the Secretary-General has the honour to request,\r\npursuant to rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General\r\nAssembly, the inclusion in the agenda of the fifty-second\r\nsession of an item entitled “Financing of the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Angola”.\r\nOwing to the nature of the item, the Secretary-General\r\nfurther requests that the item be allocated to the Fifth\r\nCommittee.\r\nUnless there is any objection, may I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly agrees, in view of the importance and\r\nurgency of the matter, that the provision of rule 40 of the\r\nrules of procedure, which would require a meeting of the\r\nGeneral Committee on the question of the inclusion of this\r\nitem on the agenda, can be waived?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly, on the proposal of the Secretary-General,\r\nwishes to include an item in the agenda of the current\r\nsession entitled “Financing of the United Nations\r\nObserver Mission in Angola”?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly wishes to allocate this item to the Fifth\r\nCommittee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The Chairman of the Fifth\r\nCommittee will be informed of the decision just taken.\r\nAgenda item 11\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/52/2)\r\nThe President: We shall now be discussing the\r\nsubstance of the fifty-second annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly, covering the period\r\nfrom 16 June 1996 to 15 June 1997 (A/52/2).\r\nIt is widely recognized that, by discharging its duties\r\nunder its primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the Council is playing a\r\nspecial role in implementing the purposes and principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nCurrently, at this important stage of the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, the activities of the Security Council are\r\nacquiring additional weight and significance. Therefore, I\r\nbelieve that the spirit of transformation should be guiding\r\nour considerations.\r\nIn this regard a new concept which has found its\r\nreflection in the preparation of the present report should be\r\nwelcomed. Its realization has produced a better picture of\r\nthe substantive work of the Security Council and introduced\r\nan analytical approach to its assessment. The measures at\r\nthis juncture constitute an important step forward aimed at\r\nenhancing the transparency of the Security Council’s work.\r\nI would like to encourage delegates to undertake a\r\nconstructive and action-oriented discussion which would\r\nprovide additional opportunities for fostering its interaction\r\nwith the General Assembly.\r\nI now call on the President of the Security Council,\r\nMr. Juan Somavía, to introduce the report of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Somavía (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nAllow me, Sir, to convey to you personally my pleasure in\r\nsubmitting this report (A/52/2) under your presidency and\r\ndirection.\r\nIt is a great honour for me to continue today the\r\npractice established in 1993 by Ambassador Sardenberg of\r\nBrazil, and continued by Ambassadors Hannay of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Al Khussaiby of Oman and Wisnumurti\r\nof Indonesia, each of whom addressed you as President of\r\nthe Security Council to introduce its annual report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOn each of those occasions, my predecessors indicated\r\nthe importance the Security Council attaches to the timely\r\nsubmission of its annual report in accordance with Articles\r\n15 and 24 of the Charter of the United Nations, and gave\r\nan account of the progress made during the periods covered\r\nin relation to the transparency of the work of the Council.\r\nConsideration of the Council’s report by the General\r\nAssembly constitutes an exceptional occasion for the\r\nnecessary dialogue and interaction between these two\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. It is thus an\r\nimportant element enabling both organs to exercise in a\r\ncomplementary manner their respective functions relating to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nI would like to express appreciation to the Security\r\nCouncil secretariat for its efforts over the past year in\r\nensuring the availability of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to all delegations well before the beginning of the\r\ngeneral debate. I hope that this practice will continue in\r\nthe future.\r\nThis year’s report, which bears the symbol A/52/2\r\nand which covers the period from 16 June 1996 to 15\r\nJune 1997, once again reflects the heavy workload of the\r\nCouncil in response to problems relating to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. As the\r\nreport indicates, during the period under consideration the\r\nCouncil held 115 formal meetings, adopted 52 resolutions\r\nand issued 54 statements by the President. In addition,\r\nCouncil members held consultations of the whole totalling\r\nsome 342 hours, considered over 105 reports of the\r\nSecretary-General and reviewed and processed more than\r\n1,214 documents and communications from States and\r\nregional and other intergovernmental organizations.\r\nHowever, the purpose of my presence here today\r\ncannot be merely to transmit data and statistics on the\r\npast year’s work. The report of the Security Council\r\nreflects the efforts which all the members of the Council\r\nhave made to ensure that the report meets the\r\nrequirements and aspirations expressed by States\r\nMembers of the Organization with regard to the working\r\nmethods of the Council. It is important for all Members\r\nof the Organization to build a relationship that will enable\r\neach principal organ to discharge properly the mandate\r\nassigned to it by the Charter.\r\nDuring the period under review, the Council’s\r\ninformal working group on documentation and other\r\nprocedural questions worked hard to find ways of\r\nsatisfying the wish of Member States to receive in a\r\ntimely manner a substantive, analytical and material\r\naccount of the Council’s work.\r\nThe main outcome of its work, as reviewed and\r\napproved by the Council, is embodied in the note by the\r\nPresident of the Security Council circulated as an official\r\ndocument under the symbol S/1997/451 of 12 June 1997.\r\nIn that note, the President sets out the new measures\r\napproved by the Council aimed at making its annual\r\nreport more analytical in nature, as requested, from 16\r\nJune 1997 onwards.\r\nThus, future reports will include the following as\r\nbackground to each subject dealt with by the Council: a\r\ndescriptive list of the decisions, resolutions and\r\npresidential statements of the Council for the preceding\r\ntwelve-month period; a description in chronological order\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nof the consideration by the Council of the matter in\r\nquestion and of actions taken by the Council on that item,\r\nincluding descriptions of the decisions, resolutions and\r\npresidential statements; a list of communications received\r\nby the Council and reports of the Secretary-General; factual\r\ndata, including dates of formal meetings and informal\r\nconsultations at which a given subject was discussed;\r\ninformation regarding the work of the subsidiary organs of\r\nthe Council, including the sanctions committees;\r\ninformation regarding the documentation and working\r\nmethods and procedures of the Council; matters brought to\r\nthe attention of the Council but not discussed by it during\r\nthe period covered; appendices as in the past, but also the\r\nfull texts of all resolutions, decisions and presidential\r\nstatements adopted or voted upon by the Council during the\r\nreporting period; and information about meetings with\r\ntroop-contributing countries. Those are the new elements\r\nthat will appear in next year’s report of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThere will also be attached, as an addendum to the\r\nreport, brief monthly assessments of the work of the\r\nCouncil, which representatives who have completed their\r\nfunctions as President of the Security Council may wish to\r\nprepare. Allow me to dwell on this last point. I think it\r\nimportant to stress that the members of the Council\r\ndiscussed at length the best way of giving a more\r\nsubstantive and analytical character to the annual report,\r\nwhich many have, quite rightly, considered as a mere\r\ndescription and compilation of information.\r\nThis initial approach adopted by the Council — that\r\nof monthly assessments that Presidents may provide at the\r\nend of their terms — is an important step in the direction\r\nthe General Assembly has requested. It is a realistic\r\nsolution, in that it enables the Council to provide\r\ninformation to the General Assembly through brief\r\nassessments prepared by each of the Presidents of the\r\nCouncil, under her or his own responsibility, for the month\r\nduring which she or he presided. These evaluations will be\r\nprepared on a personal basis by each former President, who\r\nwill consult with the other members of the Council for the\r\npurpose of reconciling the approaches that may legitimately\r\nexist to the various topics that were the focus of attention\r\nin each month.\r\nI think this is an important step towards a more\r\nanalytical report, and while the outcome of this exercise\r\nmust not necessarily be considered as representing the\r\nviews of the Security Council, it will have the virtue of\r\ncombining the individual sensibilities of each President —\r\nwhich will broaden the view on the work that has been\r\ncarried out — with consultation with members in order to\r\nreflect generally shared perspectives. This is a realistic\r\nand at the same time innovative solution which has been\r\napplied from July of this year. I believe that with time it\r\nmay become a rich source of information on the\r\nsubstantive work of the Council.\r\nAs indicated in the introduction to the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, the report is not intended as a substitute\r\nfor the official records of the Security Council, which\r\nprovide a more substantive account of its deliberations.\r\nThus, the report should be read, for the purposes of this\r\ndiscussion in the General Assembly, in conjunction with\r\nother official documents of the Council, to which it\r\nconstitutes a reference guide.\r\nI would also note that various efforts have been\r\nmade to make the work of the Council more transparent.\r\nThis is an area to which great attention will continue to\r\nbe paid. A number of mechanisms have already been\r\nestablished to improve access by Member States to the\r\nwork of the Council; our experience shows that, in some\r\ncases, effectiveness depends not only on the Council itself\r\nbut also on participation by non-members of the Council.\r\nConsultations between troop-contributing countries\r\nand Council members are a case in point. In general,\r\nthere is too little active participation by all. I believe that\r\nsuch consultations should generate more interaction\r\nbetween those countries and the Council members. Better\r\nuse needs to be made of them by all concerned. There\r\ncan be no doubt that those consultations serve an essential\r\nformal purpose, which is that of hearing the views of the\r\ncountries that place their nationals in situations of danger\r\nunder the United Nations flag — and this is an extremely\r\nimportant objective — but above all, they are important\r\nforums for non-members to contribute their views to the\r\ndecision-making process of the Council. Therefore, they\r\nshould be encouraged to use this mechanism more\r\nactively than is currently the case, and the Council will\r\ncontinue to explore possible ways and means of\r\nenhancing this practice.\r\nI think it is also useful to refer to the presidential\r\nbriefing sessions on the Council’s work, open to the 185\r\nMember States of the United Nations and normally held\r\non the same day as informal consultations of the Council\r\nhave been held. Nevertheless, few delegations participate\r\nor ask questions about the work done. I think that this is\r\nanother area in which, by working together, we will be\r\nable to make those meetings more useful and broaden\r\ntheir scope.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to draw attention to other\r\nchanges in the way the Council discharges its\r\nresponsibilities. For example, when in response to threats to\r\ninternational peace and security, a decision has been taken\r\nto impose sanctions, the Council has sought, to the extent\r\npossible and in keeping with the goal of ensuring effective\r\nimplementation, to target those responsible for the actions\r\nthat brought about the imposition of the sanctions. The\r\nCouncil has also responded to humanitarian concerns by\r\nmaking the fullest possible use of exceptions for\r\nhumanitarian reasons and has conducted regular monitoring\r\non the basis of Secretariat reports.\r\nIn addition, the Council has increasingly and\r\nsystematically sought to highlight its concern over the\r\nsituation of humanitarian workers in conflict situations and\r\nthe responsibility of the international community to protect\r\ntheir lives, property and activities. In cooperation with the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs, we have made\r\nprogress towards finding appropriate formulas for\r\nascertaining their views on the basis of their experience in\r\nthe field.\r\nFinally, there is no doubt that much still remains to be\r\ndone in all aspects of the relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council. It is the responsibility\r\nof all of us together — as Members of the United Nations,\r\nnot as members of one body or the other — to continue the\r\nsearch for working methods that will enable the\r\ninternational community to feel well-served by the\r\ninteraction of both institutions in the field of peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Park (Republic of Korea): My country being a\r\nmember of the Security Council, my delegation wishes to\r\nassociate itself with the statement of Ambassador Somavía,\r\nwho has just introduced the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly on behalf of the Council\r\nmembership.\r\nAs we all know, since 1993, when this practice of\r\npresenting the Council report to the general membership\r\nbegan, one of the central themes guiding the debate under\r\nthe current agenda item has been how to promote\r\ntransparency in the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. In our view, there are two main reasons why this\r\nquestion has drawn attention, particularly from non-\r\nmembers of the Council.\r\nFirst of all, as the Council has played an increasingly\r\nimportant role as an organ responsible for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, especially since the end of\r\nthe cold war, there has been a growing demand outside\r\nthe Council for information on the Council’s actions.\r\nNaturally, non-members of the Council have wanted to\r\nknow in time and in detail what has transpired during\r\ninformal consultations, which constitute the core of the\r\ndecision-making process in today’s Security Council.\r\nSecondly, non-members of the Council have rightly\r\nperceived a deeper and wider transparency of this world\r\nbody, in particular the Security Council, as an indication\r\nthat genuine democratization of the Organization is under\r\nway. Democratization in the structural dimension is\r\nimportant. In our view, however, democratization of the\r\nUnited Nations cannot be complete without operational\r\ndemocratization, which embraces, among other things, a\r\nreasonably fair and equal distribution and the sharing of\r\ninformation among Member States.\r\nHaving said that, we believe that over the past year\r\nthere has been some meaningful progress in the efforts to\r\npromote transparency of the Security Council. The new\r\nguidelines for the format of the report, contained in the\r\nnote by the President of the Security Council\r\n(S/1997/451), dated 12 June 1997, is a hallmark in this\r\nregard.\r\nDrawing upon the principles established by that note,\r\nthe forthcoming Council report covering the one-year\r\nperiod from 16 June 1997 will be much more user-\r\nfriendly than the one now before us. The highlight of the\r\nfuture report, however, lies in optional monthly\r\nassessments of the work of the Council, to be prepared by\r\nthe outgoing Presidents under their own responsibility, in\r\nconsultation with other members of the Council. As\r\nrightly pointed out by Ambassador Somavía in his\r\nstatement, the attachment of this addendum will make the\r\nreport itself a more substantive and analytical source of\r\ninformation, and thus will contribute to enhancing the\r\nCouncil’s transparency.\r\nSome in this Hall may wonder what the report’s\r\nformat has to do with transparency. While the\r\npresidency’s daily briefing based on informal\r\nconsultations aims more or less at the real-time\r\ntransparency of the Council’s deliberations, we believe\r\nthat monthly assessments of the report will contribute to\r\npromoting historical transparency. In other words, when\r\na question emerges with regard to past activities of the\r\nCouncil, those Members outside the Council will be able\r\nto refer to the report, rather than spending time contacting\r\na small number of delegations which are able to keep\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\ntheir own record of informal consultations inside the\r\nCouncil.\r\nOver the past year, and especially during our\r\npresidency in the month of May, my delegation tried to do\r\nits utmost to improve the format of the report to that effect.\r\nIt was also in this spirit that we provided the general\r\nmembership with an assessment of the Council’s work for\r\nthe month of May, on our own initiative, even though the\r\nnew guidelines came into effect on 16 June.\r\nIn this vein, my delegation wishes to emphasize that\r\nthis transparency-enhancing measure was made possible not\r\nonly by the efforts within the Council, but also by the\r\nattention paid by those outside the Council. In particular,\r\nthe General Assembly’s encouragement, contained in its\r\nresolution 51/193, has provided the Council with a\r\nguidepost pointing to the desirable purpose and content of\r\nfuture reports. Although we do not intend to engage in a\r\nlegalistic polemic on the relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, the six-month process,\r\nwhich was triggered by the General Assembly resolution\r\nand eventually led to the adoption of the new guidelines for\r\nthe Council report, can be regarded, in the view of my\r\ndelegation, as an example of healthy and positive\r\ninteraction between the two major pillars of the world body.\r\nWhile hoping that the ties of closer cooperation and\r\nconsultation can be further strengthened between these two\r\norgans through the continuation of such interactions, we\r\nwish to take this opportunity to look at the issue of\r\ninformation-sharing in a broader context, on the basis of\r\nour own experience as a Council member. In essence, we\r\nbelieve that the flow of information between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council should be timely,\r\nextensive and two-way, so that both organs can function in\r\na more efficient manner with better knowledge about each\r\nother’s priorities and preferences.\r\nIn our view, there now exist two major channels\r\nthrough which the general membership can receive\r\ninformation from the Council. One channel is the daily\r\nbriefing by the presidency, based upon informal\r\nconsultations, and the other is the annual report of the\r\nCouncil. As for the report, even though its new format\r\nneeds further improvement in order to fully meet the\r\nexpectations of non-members of the Council, we believe\r\nthat the progress made over the past year deserves a warm\r\nwelcome.\r\nOn the other hand, it does not seem that the briefing\r\ngiven by the presidency has been playing a substantively\r\nmeaningful role in terms of information-sharing with the\r\ngeneral membership, in particular, when one considers the\r\nfact that it is usually not well attended and there are\r\nrelatively few questions. The format of this briefing may\r\nnot appeal to most delegations, mainly because it usually\r\ntakes place hours after informal consultations have ended,\r\nor because it is often pre-empted by certain members of\r\nthe Council who brief the media immediately following\r\ninformal consultations.\r\nIndeed, whenever I come out of the consultation\r\nroom and pass by our colleagues, the so-called loungers,\r\nwaiting to get debriefed by members of the Council, I\r\nalways feel that, given the critical importance of informal\r\nconsultations, there should be a more systematic and\r\nreliable way of providing information to non-members of\r\nthe Council on a real-time basis. Although my delegation\r\nwill leave the Council at the end of this year, we will\r\ncontinue to try to find solutions to this kind of problem,\r\nin consultation with other interested delegations.\r\nRegarding the flow of information from the general\r\nmembership to the Security Council, we wish to\r\nemphasize that, without adequate knowledge about the\r\nexpectations and capabilities of those outside the Council\r\nChamber, the Security Council is unable to deal\r\neffectively with a wide spectrum of issues related to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security in the post-cold-war\r\nera. Especially because various inter-State and intra-State\r\nconflicts of this decade are characterized by diverse\r\nsources of instability, usually comprising local or regional\r\nelements, it seems essential for the Council to familiarize\r\nitself with, for instance, the views of neighbouring\r\ncountries in the area when an issue is brought to its\r\nattention. Without this input from the general\r\nmembership, Council actions might not carry enough\r\nweight to lay the necessary foundation for regional peace\r\nand security.\r\nFortunately, in recent years there have been some\r\npositive developments in this regard. Expanded use of\r\norientation debates or open debates on certain regional or\r\nthematic issues has made a substantial contribution to\r\nfostering the Council’s awareness of the various\r\ncharacteristics of and challenges posed by the present\r\ninternational security structure. It was with this in mind\r\nthat my delegation organized an open debate on the\r\nsubject of protection for humanitarian assistance to\r\nrefugees and others in conflict situations, on 21 May,\r\nduring its presidency of the Council, which eventually\r\nresulted in the adoption of a presidential statement on the\r\nmatter in June under the Russian presidency. Furthermore,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nthere is another concomitant advantage of such a forum,\r\nwhich results from the open nature of the meeting. As this\r\ntype of Council debate is open to all of the non-members\r\nof the Council, real-time transparency is guaranteed,\r\nwithout any hindrance.\r\nAnother important mechanism available, at least to\r\npart of the general membership, is the arrangement for the\r\nconsultation and exchange of information with troop-\r\ncontributing countries, as contained in the presidential\r\nstatement of 28 March 1996. Although these meetings of\r\ntroop-contributing countries and Council members have\r\ntaken place regularly over the past year, we believe that a\r\nmore dynamic exchange of views, as well as the more\r\nactive participation of troop-contributors, would make it\r\npossible for the Council to be fully informed about the\r\nindividual sensitivities and preferences of those that join\r\npeacekeeping operations before it takes any action on the\r\nmandate of peacekeeping operations.\r\nLastly, let me briefly touch upon the Arria-formula\r\nmeeting, which is a unique and extremely informal channel\r\nof information for the Council. In a nutshell, this is\r\nessentially a closed-door meeting of Council members with\r\nan invited personality, which is held primarily for the\r\npurpose of information-sharing. This month, Council\r\nmembers had another Arria-formula meeting — with\r\nMr. Diego Arria, who, as Ambassador of Venezuela,\r\ncreated this format of meeting in 1993 — in order to learn\r\nabout its origin and to discuss its effective and desirable\r\nuse. My impression is that while the informal nature of the\r\nArria-formula meeting is certainly an asset which facilitates\r\na candid exchange of views, it may also be possible to hold\r\nthe meeting in a more flexible or more open setting under\r\ncertain circumstances, with a view to enhancing the\r\ntransparency of the Council. In this context, we wish to\r\ndraw the attention of the Assembly to rule 39 of the\r\nprovisional rules of procedure of the Council, which\r\nstipulates that the Council may invite members of the\r\nSecretariat or other persons to supply it with information,\r\nand to Article 32 of the Charter, which entitles non-\r\nmembers of the Council to participate in the discussion of\r\na dispute under consideration by the Council.\r\nHowever, my delegation has no intention of claiming\r\nat this time that all future Arria-formula meetings should be\r\nheld in the form of formal meetings of the Council in\r\naccordance with the aforementioned rules. Rather, we\r\nexpect that the Council’s working group on documentation\r\nand other procedural matters, which has recently taken up\r\nthis issue, will be able to forge a balanced formula to allow\r\nboth informality and transparency.\r\nAll those mechanisms between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council, which I have just\r\ndelineated, amply demonstrate how difficult and sensitive\r\nit is to pursue transparency and efficiency at the same\r\ntime. In principle, however, we firmly believe that an\r\nenhanced partnership between the two organs should\r\nencompass both elements, so that the calibre of this world\r\nbody as a whole can be augmented in coping with the\r\nbroad range of new conflicts and instabilities which have\r\nemerged in the post-cold-war era.\r\nIndeed, contradictory as the two concepts may seem,\r\ntransparency and efficiency do complement each other. In\r\nthis age of information, it goes without saying that the\r\nefficiency of any organization depends, to a large extent,\r\nupon how adequately information is shared internally. The\r\ndegree of information- sharing, in turn, relies heavily\r\nupon the extent of transparency within the organization.\r\nIn this regard, we are convinced that efficiency and\r\ntransparency can, and should, be pursued in tandem\r\nwithin the United Nations as well.\r\nFrom this perspective, it is essential, in our view, to\r\nsecure a more orderly and reliable flow of information in\r\nboth directions between the two major organs of this\r\nworld body. While keeping this objective in mind, my\r\ndelegation has made strenuous efforts to further\r\nstrengthen and institutionalize the links between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council throughout\r\nthe past two years as a Council member, and will\r\ncontinue to do so, starting next year, outside the Council\r\nas well.\r\nSir John Weston (United Kingdom): I welcome this\r\nopportunity to consider the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly. The Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Chile, Ambassador Somavía, this\r\nmonth’s President of the Security Council, has already\r\nspoken on behalf of members of the Council in\r\nintroducing the report. This debate provides a useful\r\noccasion to consider the manner in which the Council\r\ncarries out its Charter responsibilities for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security and the way in which\r\nit keeps the wider membership informed of its activities.\r\nDuring the period covered by the report — June\r\n1996 to June 1997 — the Council continued to be faced\r\nwith a challenging, often heavy agenda. There was some\r\ngood news: slow, but steady progress in the\r\nimplementation of the Dayton peace settlement in Bosnia,\r\nand signs of hope that the indicted war criminals in that\r\ncountry would be brought to justice; and renewed hope of\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nlasting peace in Liberia and Tajikistan — two countries\r\nwhose plight has occupied the Council’s attention for much\r\nof this decade. But, elsewhere, the news has been grim. The\r\nMiddle East peace process is stumbling. War continued to\r\nravage Afghanistan. And Africa, which continues to\r\ndominate the work of the Council, saw further tragedies:\r\nthe brutal coup d’état against the democratic Government\r\nin Sierra Leone, and the humanitarian suffering in the\r\nregion of the Great Lakes. Perhaps, in retrospect, the\r\nCouncil was too slow or timid in its reactions to some of\r\nthese challenges. All too often it lacked clear, timely and\r\nwell-analysed information on the crises, so many of which\r\nwere fast-moving and confused intra-State conflicts.\r\nThe British delegation attaches great importance to\r\nensuring the greatest possible transparency to the Council’s\r\nactions. I made a particular point of this during our\r\npresidency of the Security Council in August. I hope you\r\nwill have received the assessment of the work of the\r\nCouncil during that month which I prepared following\r\nconsultations with my colleagues on the Council, and which\r\nI have sent to all permanent representatives. I hope that this\r\nnew means of enhancing Council transparency will become\r\na regular practice. It is one of a number of welcome\r\ninnovations to the form and content of the Council’s future\r\nreports to the Assembly which were agreed in June this\r\nyear.\r\nAll Members of the Organization need to make best\r\nuse of the series of changes which the Council has\r\nintroduced to its working methods over the last few years.\r\nThat process of organic evolutionary change has been most\r\nwelcome. I was therefore surprised to see, when Council\r\nPresident in August, that so few non-members of the\r\nCouncil attend the daily briefings given by the Council\r\nPresident or participate actively in the consultations\r\nbetween Council members and troop contributors which the\r\nCouncil President chairs. Like Ambassador Somavía before\r\nme, I hope we can work together to remedy that situation.\r\nThis debate is an important occasion for interaction\r\nbetween two of the principal organs of the Organization.\r\nThe British delegation will be listening carefully to the\r\nviews expressed today, both on the substance of the\r\nCouncil’s work, and on the manner in which it conducts its\r\nbusiness. And you may rest assured that we will continue\r\nto strive over the next year to ensure that the Council lives\r\nup to its responsibilities under the Charter to take swift and\r\ndecisive action to maintain international peace and security,\r\nand to ensure that the United Nations is equipped with the\r\nnecessary capacity for preventive action and peace support\r\noperations.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): Austria, like other\r\ndelegations, welcomes the introduction of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council by its current President, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Chile, earlier in the meeting. We\r\nunderstand this presentation, like similar presentations by\r\nthe respective Presidents of the Security Council in earlier\r\nyears, to be an expression of the readiness of the Council\r\nto engage in a dialogue on the discharge of its mandate\r\npursuant to Article 24 of the Charter with the General\r\nAssembly. This practice, initiated four years ago by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Brazil, Ambassador\r\nSardenberg, adds to the ongoing enhancement of the\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council, bearing in mind the responsibility of the\r\nlatter to act on behalf of the whole membership.\r\nThe newly experienced efficiency of the Security\r\nCouncil after the end of the cold war had a direct impact\r\non the interest of the general membership in the Council’s\r\nwork. Owing, inter alia, to the increase in the number of\r\nbinding decisions adopted by the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly intensified its call for involvement in\r\nthe decision-making process of the Council, and for\r\nimproved interaction with, and transparency of, the\r\nproceedings of the Council. My delegation welcomes the\r\nimportant steps taken by the Security Council over the\r\npast few years with a view to responding to the General\r\nAssembly’s request, and we are pleased to note the\r\nCouncil’s intention to continue to consider and to review\r\nways to improve the Council’s documentation and\r\nprocedure.\r\nAn adequate flow of information towards non-\r\nmembers is a necessary prerequisite to understand and\r\nassess how the Council is dealing with political issues and\r\nshould therefore be facilitated as much as possible. In our\r\nview the presidency of the Security Council should play\r\na crucial role in keeping the general membership fully\r\ninformed on the deliberations of the Council. The\r\npresidency’s monthly forecast should be complemented by\r\nan exhaustive announcement of the items to be dealt with\r\nby the Council in the daily Journal of the United Nations\r\nas well as by daily briefings on the Council’s work as\r\nannounced in the Journal. The outgoing presidency\r\nshould wind up its work by presenting an analytical report\r\non the Council’s deliberations conducted and decisions\r\ntaken under its leadership. The overall information thus\r\noffered by the presidency of the Council should be of a\r\nquality suitable to satisfy the average demand for\r\ninformation by delegations.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nWhile the monthly forecast in its current form\r\nconstitutes, indeed, a useful tool for the daily work of\r\ndelegations, the briefings offered by the respective\r\npresidencies could in our view be improved. Although some\r\npresidencies give a rather detailed survey of the Council’s\r\ndeliberations, others limit themselves to the enumeration of\r\nagenda items. A continuous high standard of information\r\ncould help to meet the General Assembly’s demand for\r\nmore transparency and would lead to increased interest of\r\ndelegations in attending these briefings. But I also agree\r\nwith remarks made earlier by Ambassador Somavía and Sir\r\nJohn Weston that these briefings should be more\r\ninteractive. This also applies to the troop contributor\r\nmeetings.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that the Security\r\nCouncil members have reviewed the format of the annual\r\nreport, and that as of next year it will be changed, taking\r\ninto account views expressed on the existing format. In the\r\npast, my delegation, like others, has made suggestions in\r\nthis regard, including the possibility of monthly reports,\r\nwhich would then be put together to form part of the yearly\r\nreport of the Security Council. We are pleased to find this\r\nconcept of monthly reports reflected in this year’s report in\r\nthe section on “Security Council working methods and\r\nprocedure” (A/52/2, chap. 28 B), and we are looking\r\nforward to seeing that implemented.\r\nIn order to add to the understanding of the Council’s\r\ndecision-making, the monthly report should mainly consist\r\nof a detailed and, as far as possible, frank analysis of the\r\nCouncil’s deliberations, including a description of diverging\r\nopinions and negotiated compromises. The report should be\r\nestablished under the responsibility of the outgoing\r\npresidency, without the requirement of formal approval by\r\nthe Council members. In order to be useful for delegations,\r\nwe believe it should be circulated in due course, possibly\r\nduring the first half of the following presidency.\r\nMy delegation would, of course, like to take this\r\nopportunity to express its appreciation to those delegations\r\nthat have already prepared such reports upon completion of\r\ntheir respective presidencies.\r\nRegular analytical reports on the work of the Security\r\nCouncil will not only contribute to the transparency of the\r\nCouncil’s work but also to the promotion of the interaction\r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly.\r\nAs much as the Security Council needs to be\r\ntransparent for non-members, it also needs to be open for\r\nincoming information. During the period under\r\nconsideration, the Council continued to make use of\r\ninformal mechanisms with a view to gathering important\r\ninformation from different sources with special knowledge\r\non a given situation. This formula seems especially useful\r\nsince it allows the Council to canvass a wide range of\r\nviews in order to form its decision-making and to help\r\nfurther to clarify different aspects covered by its work.\r\nWe therefore encourage the Council to continue this ad\r\nhoc practice in a pragmatic manner.\r\nMember States with a special interest in a specific\r\nitem should have increased opportunities to articulate their\r\nviews at an early stage of the Council’s consideration.\r\nThis kind of participation is especially important for\r\ncountries which are concerned or affected by a given\r\nconflict or which, because of their geographic location,\r\nwould assume a particular role in the ensuing operations\r\nmandated or authorized by the Security Council. Here\r\nagain, we welcome the progress made over recent years\r\nand we hope that this trend will continue. A substantial\r\ndialogue is of particular importance in the framework of\r\npeacekeeping operations. Here, the current mechanism for\r\ninteraction between the Council, the Secretariat and the\r\ntroop contributors could, in our view, be further\r\nstrengthened. However, I repeat that to my mind this also\r\nrequires increased efforts on the part of the troop-\r\ncontributing countries.\r\nThe relationship between the Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly is undoubtedly a central issue of the\r\nongoing reform debate, which is essentially motivated by\r\nthe call for more legitimacy for the Council. We are\r\nconvinced that a high degree of transparency and close\r\ninteraction among delegations will contribute to fostering\r\nthis legitimacy, and should therefore be the guiding\r\nprinciples for the future activities of the Council.\r\nMr. Eliasson (Sweden): I welcome this opportunity\r\nfor the General Assembly to review the past year’s work\r\nof the Security Council and to consider its future\r\ndirection. I thank my friend and colleague, Juan Somavía,\r\nfor his thoughtful and incisive introduction of the annual\r\nreport of the Council. I also want to express how happy\r\nI am to speak under the chairmanship of the President,\r\nwhom we all remember as a very effective Ambassador\r\nof Ukraine here for some time and, of course, at present\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.\r\nMany of the matters dealt with in the report are\r\ncomplex and serious. The Security Council has had its\r\nsuccesses but, let us admit, also its setbacks. And its\r\nagenda is constantly growing. The Security Council of\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\ntoday deals with the vast majority of ongoing conflicts in\r\nall parts of the world. From Sweden’s perspective, it is\r\nimportant to emphasize that the Council’s responsibility is\r\nglobal: no region or country can be excluded.\r\nThe Security Council always has the right — and I\r\nwould say the duty — to take the necessary action when\r\ninternational peace and security are threatened. It is\r\nlegitimate for the Council to be concerned when great\r\nnumbers of innocent civilians are killed, when gross\r\nviolations of human rights occur or when democratically\r\nelected leaders are overthrown by violent means. Such\r\ndevelopments increasingly threaten regional peace and\r\naffect international security. If they are not dealt with at an\r\nearly stage, disastrous conflagration is often the result.\r\nIt is a source of great concern, and in my view\r\nunacceptable, that Security Council resolutions are so often\r\ndefied by those to whom they are primarily directed: a\r\nsmall number of States flouting the fundamentals of\r\ninternational law, and ruthless parties to domestic conflicts\r\nbent on securing victory on the battlefield.\r\nBased on Sweden’s experiences from this year’s\r\nCouncil membership, I would like to emphasize some\r\nimportant requirements for a more effective Security\r\nCouncil: first, early warning and early information which\r\ncould lead to early action; secondly, action, according to\r\nneed, throughout the spectrum of conflict resolution, from\r\nearly warning to Chapter VII measures; thirdly, closer\r\ncooperation with regional organizations based on clear\r\nprinciples; and, fourthly and lastly, stronger interaction with\r\nUnited Nations Members outside the Council.\r\nI want to emphasize that these four points should be\r\nconcerns not only for the Security Council but for the\r\nwhole of the United Nations. The success or failure of\r\nSecurity Council action is in the hands of all of us and,\r\nindeed, affects all of us. Effective conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building must, indeed, involve the\r\nUnited Nations system as a whole.\r\nAs to my first point, the Security Council must be able\r\nto take early action based on early warning and\r\ninformation, preferably already at the preventive stage.\r\nLessons should be learned from current cases such as the\r\nformer Zaire and the Republic of the Congo. And the\r\npreventive mission in Macedonia may soon be pronounced\r\na success, but it has yet to set a precedent. The Security\r\nCouncil must be politically prepared to consider preventive\r\nmeasures at different levels, at short notice, on a case-by-\r\ncase basis.\r\nThe possibilities of conflict prevention could also be\r\nconsidered from a regional or subregional perspective.\r\nThe situation in large parts of Africa today is worrying,\r\nwith a growing belt of conflicts stretching from the South\r\nAtlantic to the Red Sea. There is here an increasing need\r\nfor a trustful and constructive relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council, and\r\nregional actors.\r\nConflict prevention is admittedly a difficult subject\r\nfor the Security Council. Respect for sovereignty is of\r\ncourse a fundamental principle in the work of the United\r\nNations, but affected countries all too often try at any\r\nprice to avoid what they perceive as outside interference.\r\nRegional organizations and important neighbours often\r\ntake a similar approach. Council members are cautious —\r\noften too cautious. As we have seen, missed opportunities\r\ncome at a high price, mainly to those directly concerned\r\nin the end.\r\nStrengthening the United Nations capability in\r\nconflict prevention remains a priority for Sweden, as a\r\nmember of the Security Council. To this should be added\r\nthe development of a new generation of peacekeeping\r\noperations and measures to improve openness and broad\r\nconsultations in the work of the Council. These, indeed,\r\nwere three main features of Sweden’s policy when elected\r\nto the Council, with your support, a year ago.\r\nAs to my second point, it is fundamental that the\r\nSecurity Council be able to decide on actions throughout\r\nthe spectrum of conflict resolution. You can visualize a\r\nkind of ladder of preventive measures which we should\r\nuse, from early warning, prevention, political persuasion,\r\nmediation and other Chapter VI instruments, to\r\npeacekeeping and, if need be, Chapter VII action.\r\nHere, I would like to commend Ambassador\r\nSomavía for his observations on the need for\r\nhumanitarian exceptions to sanctions regimes. It is\r\nimportant to the credibility of the United Nations on\r\nChapter VII action that vulnerable groups not pay the\r\nprice for their leaders, who are the real and legitimate\r\nobjects of sanctions. When conditions merit the\r\nestablishment of new peacekeeping operations, all Council\r\nmembers must quickly be ready to take the decisions\r\nrequired according to this ladder of prevention and action.\r\nMultinational forces may in some acute situations be\r\nthe best option for international action. It is vital that such\r\ndeployment take place with the endorsement of the United\r\nNations. And we should be aware of the risk of overuse\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nof multinational forces at the expense of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nMember States which turn to the United Nations when\r\ntheir security is threatened legitimately expect to be heard\r\nand helped without delay. The Security Council, I stress\r\nagain, must show its willingness and ability to respond to\r\nsuch requests from Member States in all parts of the world.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations will suffer if\r\nmultinational forces become a substitute for direct United\r\nNations action due to lack of funds or unrelated\r\nconsiderations.\r\nThirdly, the role of regional organizations in the work\r\nof the Council is growing in importance. This is\r\nwelcome — but more could be done. In the Balkans, the\r\nactions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the European Union and others continue to prove\r\nessential for peace and stability. In other parts of the world,\r\nregional organizations also play a positive role in conflict\r\nprevention and resolution.\r\nYet the Security Council can never abdicate its\r\nprimary responsibility for international peace and security.\r\nIt must defend fundamental principles of international law.\r\nWhen regional peace efforts cannot produce results, or\r\nwhen regional action has become a part of the problem and,\r\nsadly, not of the solution, the Security Council must insist\r\non assuming its primary role.\r\nLastly, stronger interaction with non-Council members\r\nmust be a priority. The Security Council has gone a long\r\nway towards increasing openness and broadening\r\nconsultations with non-members, particularly troop\r\ncontributors. Again, much still needs to be done, and of\r\ncourse an active interest on the part of the non-Council\r\nmember States is essential, as Ambassador Somavía and\r\nAmbassador Weston have underlined. The Council should,\r\nfor example, follow the proposals made for more frequent\r\norientation debates and for including affected non-members\r\nin its discussions, as provided for by Article 31 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nOpenness is essential as such, but in particular as a\r\nmeans towards interaction. Non-Council members should do\r\ntheir part by using the opportunities for substantive\r\ndiscussions, at meetings with troop-contributing countries,\r\nfor example. And all United Nations Member States have\r\na role to play, we should always remember, in ensuring\r\ncompliance with Security Council decisions.\r\nThe format of Security Council reports has been\r\nsubject to much criticism. The Council has now decided\r\non some improvements, notably the introduction of\r\nmonthly presidential assessments. Here, I would like to\r\nthank Ambassador Sucharipa for his comments about\r\nthose reports that have been issued this year.\r\nBut Security Council reports — annual or special —\r\ncan at best be instruments. They should help ensure that\r\nthe work of the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly is mutually reinforcing. They should remind\r\nboth bodies of the United Nations that they have different\r\nresponsibilities, but also share the same constituency and,\r\nindeed, the same vocation, namely, to build peace and\r\nsecurity for all.\r\nMr. Ople (Philippines): We thank both the Security\r\nCouncil for the timely submission of its annual report to\r\nthe General Assembly and the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, the Permanent Representative of Chile, for his\r\npresentation of the report. We also appreciate the efforts\r\nof the Council to improve the content of the report and\r\nthe measures it has taken in this regard, as stated in\r\nsection B of chapter 28 in part II of the report. We look\r\nforward in particular to receiving the addendum\r\nmentioned in paragraph 5 of the note contained in section\r\nB, consisting of brief assessments on the work of the\r\nSecurity Council by representatives who have served as\r\nPresident of the Security Council.\r\nWe believe these efforts to improve the report are a\r\ncontinuation of the positive changes that have occurred in\r\nrecent years to improve the work and documentation of\r\nthe Council. These changes have not gone unrecognized,\r\nand we encourage the Council to enhance its efforts\r\nfurther in this regard.\r\nNevertheless, and despite the efforts to improve the\r\nreport, we are disappointed that, once again, the report\r\nfails to measure up substantively to what the General\r\nAssembly called for in resolution 51/193, particularly with\r\nrespect to the improvements suggested in operative\r\nparagraph 4 of that resolution. These improvements\r\ninclude the need for the provision of substantial\r\ninformation on the work and recommendations of the\r\nCouncil’s subsidiary bodies such as the sanctions\r\ncommittees, on the informal consultations of the whole\r\nundertaken prior to action by the Council on substantive\r\nissues, and on requests received under Article 50 of the\r\nCharter and actions taken by the Council thereon.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nAs called for in the same paragraph, a section\r\nhighlighting the extent to which resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly on issues falling within the scope of both organs\r\nhave been taken into account by the Council would also be\r\na very useful addition to the report. A section of this nature\r\nwould provide a good basis for assessing and analysing the\r\nCouncil’s work, and for considering ways to improve the\r\ninteraction between the Assembly and the Council.\r\nThe Philippine delegation believes the content of the\r\npresent report, which remains essentially a compilation of\r\nofficial proceedings and decisions, continues to make it\r\ndifficult for the General Assembly to undertake a truly\r\nsubstantive and in-depth consideration and analysis of the\r\nactions of the Council, as well as its subsidiary bodies. We\r\ntherefore urge and encourage the Council to consider and\r\nimplement the various recommendations to improve its\r\nreport contained in resolution 51/193.\r\nAn analytical and substantive annual report would also\r\nfacilitate implementation of the decision in General\r\nAssembly resolution 51/241, calling upon the President of\r\nthe General Assembly, based on his assessment of the\r\ndebate on the report, to arrange informal consultations to\r\ndiscuss the need and content of any action by the Assembly\r\non matters arising from the debate on the report. A report\r\nin line with that envisioned by resolution 51/193 would, in\r\nour view, encourage a more substantive debate and thus\r\nenhance the President’s ability to determine the nature and\r\noutput of these informal consultations. We further believe\r\nthat holding such consultations on a regular basis would\r\ncontribute to a more detailed examination of the report and\r\nlead to a more productive and interactive relationship\r\nbetween the two organs, as well as help revitalize the\r\nAssembly’s role in addressing issues affecting international\r\npeace and security.\r\nWe therefore urge the President to take this decision\r\ninto account and, notwithstanding the observations we have\r\nmade on the contents of the present report, to consider\r\narranging for such consultations at an appropriate time\r\nduring this session. The President may wish to consider the\r\nscope and particular matters which could be discussed in\r\nthe informal consultations. For this reason, we believe that\r\nthis agenda item should be kept open throughout the year,\r\nas decided by the General Assembly in resolution 51/241.\r\nThe submission of special reports by the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly, during the course of each\r\nsession, in accordance with Articles 15 and 24 of the\r\nCharter and as encouraged in paragraph 5 of resolution\r\n51/193, would also be a major vehicle for ensuring\r\ncontinuous and up-to-date information on the Security\r\nCouncil’s decisions and activities. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation suggests that special reports be issued on major\r\nCouncil actions and/or situations affecting international\r\npeace and security that occur in the period between the\r\nsubmission of the annual reports. These actions would\r\ninclude the establishment or termination of peacekeeping\r\nor other operations or substantive changes in their\r\nmandates. Decisions by the Council to impose or lift\r\nsanctions on any Member State of the United Nations or\r\nto change existing sanctions regimes should also be\r\noccasions for issuing a special report.\r\nThe need for a more substantive Security Council\r\nreport is an essential element of the broader efforts to\r\nreform the Council’s working methods in order to achieve\r\ngreater transparency in its work and secure more effective\r\nparticipation of non-members in its decision-making\r\nprocess. The Philippines, along with the other members of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, has over the past few years\r\nbeen actively supporting specific reforms towards this\r\nend, particularly in the discussions of the Open-Ended\r\nWorking Group on the reform of the Security Council.\r\nWe shall continue to do so.\r\nIn addition to a more substantive report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, these desired reforms include more\r\neffective consultations with troop-contributing countries,\r\nmeasures to allow participation of non-members in the\r\nCouncil’s informal consultations of the whole, through the\r\napplication of Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter; the\r\nholding of open public meetings in lieu of informal\r\nconsultations of the whole; more frequent consultations\r\nand meetings between the Presidents of the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council; and clearer\r\nprocedures for requesting meetings of the Council in\r\naccordance with Article 35 of the Charter. It is also\r\nnecessary to curtail and rationalize the use of the veto. In\r\nthis regard, we support the position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement that the veto power should apply only to\r\nactions taken under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nWe believe that if such measures could be adopted,\r\nin addition to those related to improving the report, the\r\nUnited Nations would truly be strengthened and the\r\nprinciples of democracy and sovereign equality of States\r\nfully observed.\r\nMr. Hasmy Agam (Malaysia): I would like to\r\nexpress my deep appreciation to the President of the\r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador Somavía of Chile, for\r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council to the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation is particularly grateful to\r\nhim for his oral presentation, which was an important\r\nintroduction and supplement to the report.\r\nThe debate on the report of the Security Council will\r\nprovide an opportunity for the other 170 Members of the\r\nOrganization that are not members of the Council to be\r\nfully informed and to discuss the work of the Council over\r\nthe past year. The debate is meant to be not a ritual and a\r\nmere formality, but an opportunity for the Security Council,\r\nas the primary organ of the United Nations tasked with the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, to apprise\r\nthe Member States of the United Nations of its decisions\r\nand actions. The debate also provides an opportunity for\r\nMember States to make certain pronouncements on the\r\nactions of the Council as they pertain to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nMy delegation, along with other Member States, made\r\na number of pertinent observations and suggestions last\r\nyear on both the format and the substance of the Council’s\r\nreports. Unfortunately, the report continues to remain\r\nlargely a compendium of presidential statements and\r\nCouncil resolutions and a compilation of communications\r\nand documentation received by the Council during the\r\ncourse of the year. Reading through this compendium, a\r\nState that is not a member of the Council would have\r\ndifficulty in following the work of the Council and\r\nparticularly in fully comprehending the decisions arrived at\r\nby the Council. “As a guide to the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil during the period covered” (A/52/2, introduction,\r\nsecond paragraph), it would have been most helpful to non-\r\nmembers if the report had been more analytical. It would\r\nhave been particularly useful if the report had contained a\r\nbrief and objective assessment of the work of the Council\r\nduring the period under review, covering both success or\r\nlack of success in respect of the issues handled by the\r\nCouncil. My delegation notes with interest some innovative\r\napproaches that will be incorporated in future reports of the\r\nCouncil, as indicated by the President of the Council in his\r\noral submission this morning. We look forward to reading\r\nand scrutinizing these future reports. In the meantime, our\r\ncomments will be based on the report in its present form.\r\nGiven the growing trend of the increased\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations, there is a need for\r\ngreater transparency in the work of the Security Council,\r\nwhich, unfortunately, remains the least democratic of\r\nUnited Nations institutions. While the practice of closed\r\nmeetings of the Council cannot be discarded, and may be\r\nnecessary to enable members of the Council to facilitate\r\ndecision-making on sensitive issues, the general\r\nmembership of the Organization also needs — and\r\nexpects — to be informed of the substance or thrust of\r\nthose closed consultations. There have been several\r\nsuggestions made to achieve increased transparency in the\r\nwork of the Council, such as the publication of summary\r\nrecords of the Council’s closed consultations. Such\r\nsummary records would supplement the annual report of\r\nthe Council in its present format and redress its many\r\ninherent shortcomings. There is also merit to the proposal\r\nthat a Security Council bulletin, to be published on a\r\nmonthly basis, should include references to the positions\r\nof members of the Council on actions taken by it. There\r\nhave also been suggestions to publish quarterly reports,\r\nwhich would increase transparency and strengthen the free\r\nflow of information between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Any one of these proposals deserves\r\nserious consideration. More important, there should be\r\nmore frequent formal meetings of the Council, which\r\nwould allow non-members to express their views on the\r\nvarious important issues being addressed by the Council\r\nbefore decisions are taken on them. Formal meetings of\r\nthe Council would be a clear manifestation of the\r\ninstitutional linkage between the Council and the larger\r\nmembership of the Organization, which should be further\r\nstrengthened.\r\nNon-members should also benefit from special\r\nbriefings given by the Special Representatives and Envoys\r\nof the Secretary-General on issues before the Council.\r\nThose briefings would update non-members of the\r\nCouncil on the latest developments on issues of\r\nimportance and concern to the international community.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the regular briefings given\r\nby the President of the Council to non-members.\r\nUnfortunately, very often little information is given during\r\nthese briefings beyond what is given to the representatives\r\nof the press corps, and this really explains the general\r\nlack of interest shown by Member States in the briefings.\r\nWhile there is every reason for the President or his\r\nrepresentative to be prudent in the briefings, he or she\r\nshould be encouraged to be a little more forthcoming in\r\nresponding to questions posed by Member States than he\r\nor she would be to questions posed by the press corps. At\r\nthe same time, it would be helpful to Member States if\r\nthese briefings were given immediately following the\r\nconsultations of the Council rather than some two or three\r\nhours later and usually after the briefing of the press, as\r\nis currently the practice. My delegation, however,\r\nwelcomes the monthly assessment by the President of the\r\nCouncil, which has been helpful in giving an insight into\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nthe Council’s work during that particular month. We hope\r\nthat this practice will continue and be formalized.\r\nWhile the Secretariat and other organs of the United\r\nNations are undergoing reforms with a view to enhancing\r\nthe Organization’s effectiveness and efficiency, so too must\r\nthe Security Council. The discussions that have taken place\r\nin the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council have generated many\r\nconcrete ideas and proposals pertaining to both the\r\ndecision-making process, or methodologies, of the Council\r\nand its structure. All of these would contribute to making\r\nthe Council more effective and efficient. They would also\r\nmake it more transparent, representational and democratic,\r\nin spite of its inherent limitations. My delegation therefore\r\nlooks forward to the early conclusion of these deliberations\r\nso as to enable the reform of the Council to move ahead\r\nwithout undue delay. The reform measures, once agreed\r\nand implemented, would also serve to further enhance the\r\nCouncil’s standing and legitimacy in the eyes of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMy delegation is particularly concerned about one\r\nimportant aspect of the work of the Council: the imposition\r\nof sanctions on Member States. We regret that sanctions\r\nhave of late been used, or have been perceived to be used,\r\nas a tool in the furtherance of narrow national interests of\r\nsome of the Council’s members, to serve specific political\r\nobjectives or agendas. Such use or perception of use of\r\nsanctions does not contribute to enhancing the image or\r\nprestige of the Council. Sanctions, which are imposed on\r\nbehalf of Member States, have often brought untold misery\r\nand hardship to an unintended target — the helpless\r\npopulace, particularly children, nursing mothers and the\r\ninfirm and aged. Here my delegation welcomes the\r\nimportant comments made by the President of the Council\r\nin respect to the humanitarian aspects of sanctions. My\r\ndelegation has always believed that sanctions should be an\r\ninstrument of last resort and should be applied only after\r\nother measures have failed. At the same time, when they\r\nare applied sanctions should have clear and specific\r\nobjectives and parameters and be subject to regular reviews\r\nand evaluations by the Council. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation had in the past called for a separate chapter in\r\nthe report to comprehensively reflect the activities and\r\ndecisions of the sanctions committee, a matter which,\r\nregrettably, continues to be treated in a superficial fashion.\r\nThe establishment of an institutionalized system of\r\nconsultations between Security Council members and troop-\r\ncontributing countries has contributed to increased\r\ncoordination in peacekeeping operations. This practice\r\nshould be continued and further institutionalized. On a\r\nrelated matter, Malaysia, as a troop contributor, is\r\nincreasingly concerned that the continuing financial crisis\r\nfaced by the Organization has resulted in the subsidizing\r\nof a sizeable portion of the costs of peacekeeping\r\noperations by the troop-contributing countries, many of\r\nwhich, like Malaysia, are developing countries. In this\r\nregard, my delegation would once again urge all Member\r\nStates to pay their peacekeeping contributions on time, in\r\nfull and without conditions. The United Nations should\r\nnot be put in a position of not being able to reimburse\r\ntroop-contributing countries on time. Such a situation will\r\nonly discourage the developing countries from coming\r\nforward to contribute their troops for peacekeeping\r\noperations. On a positive note, Malaysia is gratified that\r\nthe question of equitable compensation to those men and\r\nwomen who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of\r\nthe United Nations has now been satisfactorily settled on\r\nthe basis of just and equitable principles.\r\nMr. Ayewah (Nigeria): Let me begin by thanking\r\nthe President of the Security Council, the Representative\r\nof Chile, for his introduction of the annual report of the\r\nCouncil covering the period 16 June 1996 to 15 June\r\n1997, contained in document A/52/2.\r\nThe presentation of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly is important and serves\r\na number of purposes. First, it helps to enhance and\r\nstrengthen the cooperative relationship that should exist\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly.\r\nSecondly, it affords the General Assembly the opportunity\r\nto further inform itself about the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil and to make inputs and recommendations that,\r\nhopefully, will influence the future direction of its work.\r\nThirdly, it underscores the importance of accountability.\r\nAfter all, the Security Council acts on behalf of the entire\r\nmembership of the United Nations. By reporting to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Council assures itself of the\r\nsupport of the Assembly members for the activities and\r\ndecisions it has taken on their behalf.\r\nSince the establishment by the Security Council, in\r\nJune 1993, of an informal working group on\r\ndocumentation and other procedural matters, and partly as\r\na result of the work of the Open-ended Working Group\r\non Security Council reform, a series of steps has been\r\ntaken by the Council to provide for greater transparency,\r\nand increased interaction and consultation between\r\nCouncil members and non-members. All these have made\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\na salutary contribution to the credibility of the Security\r\nCouncil, but they still fall short of the desired transparency\r\nwhich most United Nations Member States expect from the\r\nCouncil. Closed-door consultations continue to be the\r\nCouncil’s preferred approach. Besides, most of the\r\nimprovements that have been proposed for the working\r\nmethods of the Council have not yet been institutionalized.\r\nIn this regard, we note the emerging consensus in the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform about Cluster-II-related issues. We,\r\nhowever, wish to underscore once again that no reform of\r\nthe Council will be complete without an expansion on an\r\nequitable geographical basis of the Council’s membership\r\nin both categories. We shall, of course, have more to say on\r\nthis issue under the proper agenda item.\r\nAs for the report itself, we note the improvements that\r\nhave been agreed upon by Council members aimed at\r\nenhancing its analytical nature. I am referring to measures\r\napproved by the Council, as listed in its President’s note of\r\n12 June 1997, document S/1997/451. These include the\r\nattachment, as an addendum to the report, of brief\r\nassessments on the work of the Council which\r\nrepresentatives who have completed their functions as\r\nPresident of the Security Council prepare on their own\r\nresponsibility and in consultation with Council members.\r\nThe circulation of such assessments by some past\r\nPresidents is both responsive and instructive.\r\nNonetheless — and we must continue to draw\r\nattention to this — the report basically remains a\r\ncompilation of the various communications received by the\r\nCouncil and of the decisions adopted by it during the\r\nreporting period. We believe the report should provide an\r\nanalysis of the activities of the Security Council, the\r\ndecisions that have been taken, and how far those decisions\r\nhave evolved over time, particularly during the\r\nimplementation phase.\r\nIt would be very useful to know whether a particular\r\ndecision has helped to move the process forward towards\r\nthe resolution of the problem and what lessons, if any,\r\ncould be learned. Although this would involve a lot more\r\nwork and the use of increased resources, we believe that it\r\nis the only way to have a user-friendly report on the\r\nCouncil’s activities.\r\nThe workload of the Council in the discharge of its\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security continues to be heavy. It has increased\r\nnot only in volume, but in scope. Although the statistics for\r\nthis reporting period in terms of the number of formal\r\nmeetings, resolutions, presidential statements and hours of\r\nconsultations show a decline compared to the high\r\nvolume of two to three years ago, it is still a heavy\r\nresponsibility and a reflection of the changed international\r\npolitical environment.\r\nSimilarly, although there has been a decrease in the\r\nnumber of United Nations peacekeeping operations and\r\ntroop levels in comparison with the state of play two to\r\nthree years ago, one must admit that these operations\r\ncontinue to be a major undertaking of the United Nations,\r\naccounting for a greater percentage of United Nations\r\nresources and expenditure. A majority of the\r\npeacekeeping operations currently being undertaken by\r\nthe United Nations are located in developing countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa. Efforts to find solutions to some of\r\nthese conflicts have become the responsibility of regional\r\nor subregional organizations acting in concert among\r\nthemselves and in pursuit of the provisions of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nIn some cases, the United Nations has continued to\r\nplay a complementary role. In the West African\r\nsubregion, for example, the solution of the Liberian\r\nconflict benefited from a cooperative relationship between\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the United Nations, including the co-\r\ndeployment of personnel on the ground. Although it took\r\na while before the Security Council became actively\r\nengaged in the resolution of the Liberian conflict, its\r\ninvolvement and that of other members of the\r\ninternational community at some crucial stages of the\r\nprocess proved very helpful and useful.\r\nFollowing the overthrow of the democratically\r\nelected Government of President Kabbah of Sierra Leone\r\non 25 May 1997, the ECOWAS leaders have again seized\r\nthe initiative to resolve the situation. At the ECOWAS\r\nsummit meeting in August 1997, they decided to impose\r\nsanctions and an embargo on the junta. The import of\r\nthese measures was subsequently endorsed by the Security\r\nCouncil in its resolution 1132 (1997) of 8 October 1997.\r\nWith this combination of measures, the ECOWAS\r\nCommittee of Five has now achieved a major\r\nbreakthrough in its dialogue with the junta. We hope that\r\nthe six-month peace plan for the restoration of\r\nconstitutional order and the reinstatement of the\r\nGovernment of President Kabbah will be faithfully\r\ncomplied with by the junta. And for this to happen, the\r\ncontinuing support of the Security Council, including\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nthrough the maintenance of the sanctions and the\r\ndeployment of military observers, will be necessary.\r\nHowever, there are some crisis situations in Africa\r\nwhich have not received the full attention of the Security\r\nCouncil. A case that readily comes to mind in this regard\r\nis the situation in the Republic of the Congo. At the outset\r\nof the crisis, many African countries indicated their\r\nreadiness to make troops available to an inter-African force\r\nto help stabilize the situation. Their expectation was that the\r\nUnited Nations or the international community would\r\nfinance their participation. This never materialized. The\r\ncrisis in that country has resulted in the displacement of\r\nover two thirds of the residents of Brazzaville and the\r\nextensive destruction of the city’s infrastructure. The crisis\r\nhas been further complicated by the involvement of external\r\nforces. We can only hope that these forces will pursue the\r\nlogic of peace rather than their economic, political or\r\nstrategic interests.\r\nIn concluding, we would like to underscore the\r\ncontinuing primacy of the responsibility of the United\r\nNations in the promotion of international peace and\r\nsecurity. International peace and security are indivisible.\r\nThis is the essence of collective security. We therefore hope\r\nthat the Council will, even at this late stage, get itself\r\nproperly seized of the situation in the Congo with a view to\r\nthe restoration of normalcy in that part of the world.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to thank the\r\nSecretariat for the efforts that have gone into the\r\npreparation of this report. We are aware that a lot of time\r\nand resources have gone into its production.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nGeneral Assembly has before it the report of the Security\r\nCouncil for the period June 1996-June 1997. Continuing the\r\nsound practice begun by Brazil, the report was introduced\r\nto us today by the Security Council President, Ambassador\r\nJuan Somavía of Chile.\r\nMexico attaches special importance to the obligation\r\nof the Security Council under Article 24 of the Charter to\r\nsubmit annual reports on its work to the General Assembly.\r\nThe Member States, which have conferred upon the Council\r\nthe primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, must be apprised of the\r\nactivities undertaken by that organ on their behalf.\r\nThat is why it is a source of particular satisfaction to\r\nnote that, in recent years, the members of the Security\r\nCouncil have made commendable efforts earnestly to fulfil\r\nthis duty. We seem to have moved beyond the time when\r\nthat provision of the Charter was considered to be a mere\r\nbureaucratic procedure, devoid of substance.\r\nThe document before us today has the same basic\r\nstructure as last year’s report. We welcome the continued\r\ndesire for openness, which allows relations between the\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly faithfully to reflect the\r\nspirit of balance sought by the authors of the Charter.\r\nCommunication between the two organs must be fluid and\r\nconstant. It is appropriate to reiterate that the Security\r\nCouncil acts not on its own authority, but on behalf of us\r\nall. We are all affected by its decisions. Its activities are\r\nof interest to us all.\r\nThe report also announces that, as of 1997, the\r\nhealthy trend of enhancing the analytical nature of the\r\ndescription of the Council’s tasks will be strengthened.\r\nWe appreciate the assessments that have been prepared by\r\nthe successive Presidents of the Council in recent months.\r\nThese documents are useful instruments in helping us to\r\nunderstand better what is happening. We welcome this\r\ninitiative, which could not be included officially in the\r\ncurrent report because it was adopted outside the period\r\ncovered by the document.\r\nWe urge future Presidents of the Council to continue\r\nthis practice. We assure them that we appreciate their\r\nefforts to keep us informed, which benefits both the\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly.\r\nThe first part of the report details the many items the\r\nCouncil considered as it discharged its responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. The\r\nlong list of conflicts and situations of tension shows that,\r\ndespite the hopes aroused by the end of the cold war,\r\nthere are lingering and new situations that threaten peace\r\nand security everywhere in the world.\r\nWe note with concern that the Security Council has\r\noften had to intervene in internal situations — situations\r\nthat were not envisioned by the authors of the Charter.\r\nThe clear line that should separate international action\r\nfrom national jurisdiction has been blurring. We are\r\nwitnessing a new scenario whose limits have not yet been\r\ndefined. Practice has been transcending law.\r\nMexico insists that it is critical to act cautiously. The\r\nSecurity Council must not use an elastic interpretation of\r\nChapter VII of the Charter to become an organ with\r\nlimitless powers. The maintenance of peace cannot justify\r\nthe indiscriminate imposition of exceptional measures not\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nonly upon States, as foreseen in the Charter, but also upon\r\nentities not contemplated in the Charter, such as individuals\r\nand internal factions — which, as we all know, has\r\nhappened recently. Abuse of Chapter VII weakens the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAmong the issues before the Security Council, one, for\r\nobvious reasons, is of great importance to Mexico:\r\nGuatemala. The Council operation in that neighbouring\r\ncountry shows that success is achieved when the principles\r\ngoverning peacekeeping operations are strictly respected.\r\nUnited Nations intervention in Guatemala could well serve\r\nas an exemplar for other missions. The Security Council did\r\nnot try to supplant the will of the parties to the long-\r\nstanding Guatemalan conflict. It was those parties who,\r\nwith patience and dedication, resolved their differences at\r\nthe negotiating table and signed a peace agreement. It was\r\nthey who requested a United Nations presence to monitor\r\nthe implementation of what had been agreed. The Security\r\nCouncil acceded to that formal request by the Government\r\nof Guatemala and sent the small military mission needed to\r\nsupervise the ceasefire and the demobilization. The\r\noperation had a defined mandate and it carried out its tasks\r\nin full and on schedule.\r\nThese events prove the importance of acting in\r\naccordance with principles. With political will, clarity of\r\npurpose and unified resolve, the desired results will be\r\nobtained.\r\nWe welcome the initiative taken in September —\r\noutside the present reporting period — to hold a meeting to\r\nconsider the persistent problems afflicting the African\r\ncontinent. We hope that its results will help Africa at last\r\nto achieve the peace, stability and prosperity its peoples\r\ndeserve. We believe that the report to be submitted by the\r\nSecretary-General, with specific recommendations for\r\npreventing and resolving conflicts there, will help lay the\r\ngroundwork for peace and sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment as a support for African efforts to build a\r\nfuture of peace, democracy and justice.\r\nThe Security Council reports on growing cooperation\r\nfrom regional organizations in the maintenance of peace.\r\nHere my delegation stresses that the activities of regional\r\norganizations in this sphere must fall within the framework\r\nof Chapter VIII of the Charter and must strictly respect the\r\nfunctions and areas of competence defined in their\r\nrespective founding statutes.\r\nThe report of the Security Council before us today is\r\nquite different from the sterile document to which we had\r\nbecome accustomed, and we reiterate how much this\r\npleases us. The Council has begun to heed the appeals of\r\nthe General Assembly, among which we highlight\r\nresolution 51/193, adopted last year on the initiative of\r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Mexico voted\r\nin favour of that resolution to demonstrate anew its\r\ncommitment to the openness and transparency that should\r\ncharacterize the work of the Security Council. We\r\nwelcome this trend, and hope that it will be strengthened\r\nwith the support of the members of the Council, and\r\nespecially that of its five permanent members.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): First of all, let me congratulate the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Chile, Ambassador Juan Somavía, for\r\nhis very clear and comprehensive presentation of the\r\nCouncil’s annual report to the General Assembly. My\r\ncompliments go also to the Secretariat for its excellent\r\npreparatory work.\r\nThere is little need to stress the importance of the\r\nsubject of today’s discussion. What the United Nations\r\nCharter requires is close and effective coordination\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly,\r\nconsistent with the respective responsibilities of those two\r\nprincipal organs. The Security Council’s report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly is therefore an essential tool for\r\nensuring such coordination. Article 15 of the Charter sets\r\nout in its first paragraph the legal framework for the\r\nAssembly’s consideration of the report, focused on the\r\nmeasures decided upon or taken by the Council to\r\nmaintain international peace and security.\r\nPrevious and current debates in the General\r\nAssembly and other forums, such as the Working Group\r\non Security Council reform, have underlined the need for\r\na meaningful debate on the Council’s report, as well as\r\nfor greater transparency in the Council’s work and greater\r\naccessibility to non-members of the Council. My country,\r\nItaly, has constantly been and will continue to be strongly\r\nin favour of pursuing these goals.\r\nIn particular, we must remain extremely vigilant to\r\nincrease — and not to reduce or undermine in any way or\r\nform — the fundamental role of the General Assembly as\r\nthe major pillar of the United Nations. We should not\r\nallow it; we should not allow a decrease in the leverage\r\nof the General Assembly vis-à-vis other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council.\r\nReforms should take into account everyone’s views and\r\nbe the result of intense consultations, carried out in a true\r\ndemocratic spirit and with equal involvement of all — I\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nstress “all” — United Nations Member States. The outcome\r\nshould not be such as to benefit the very few at the expense\r\nof the great many — and, I should add, at the expense of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nAs Ambassador Somavía pointed out, this year’s\r\nreport shows that the Council has continued its intense\r\nactivity in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and related humanitarian aspects. The number of\r\nmeetings and informal consultations held, and decisions\r\ntaken, demonstrate the Council’s commitment and\r\ndedication in responding to the demands of today’s\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn particular, I would like to highlight the\r\nextraordinary speed and efficiency with which the Council\r\nacted at the request of Albania and Italy to authorize the\r\nmultinational peace operation in Albania. The actual\r\ndecision of the Security Council came in a matter of only\r\n12 hours from the time of our request, setting, I believe, a\r\nrecord in the history of Security Council deliberations on\r\npeacekeeping operations. As we are all aware, Operation\r\nAlba was a complete success, helping to re-establish law,\r\norder and a legitimate Government in Albania.\r\nAs a member of the Council during part of the period\r\ncovered by the report, Italy actively participated in the\r\nCouncil’s efforts and work. The guidelines for our action\r\nwere the principles of reciprocal trust, transparency and\r\naccountability, and the idea of promoting and defending the\r\ninterests of the United Nations, not the interests of a\r\nparticular country or group of member countries. What we\r\ndid when we were in the Council — and I am delighted to\r\nrepeat it here — was to inform others of what we were\r\ndoing almost by the hour when this involved other parties,\r\nother Governments. I really and truly think that that should\r\nbe the duty of every Council member.\r\nIn the area of the Council’s working methods and\r\nprocedure, we note with satisfaction the steps that were\r\ntaken to improve the format of the report to the General\r\nAssembly. These measures will take effect in the\r\npreparation of the next report, covering the period 16 June\r\n1997 to 15 June 1998. As indicated by the President of the\r\nSecurity Council’s note (S/1997/451) of 12 June 1997, they\r\nrelate to the timely submission of the report, as well as to\r\nvarious information to be included in it, dealing in\r\nparticular with meetings of the Council and related\r\ndecisions, matters brought to the attention of the Council\r\nand the activity of subsidiary organs. More important, the\r\nnote provides for the attachment, as an addendum to the\r\nreport, of brief assessments on the work of the Security\r\nCouncil, prepared under their own responsibility by\r\nrepresentatives who have completed their functions as\r\nPresident of the Council. I believe that this is indeed a\r\nsignificant achievement, which goes in the right direction,\r\nthe direction of promoting increased participation of all,\r\nand exclusion of none, and true transparency in the work\r\nof the Council. However, Italy believes that all these\r\nmeasures, albeit commendable, are still insufficient to\r\nadequately enhance the interaction between the Council\r\nand the General Assembly.\r\nIn this respect, I would like to emphasize once again\r\nthe need for the report to provide substantive indications\r\nof the process leading to the Council’s decisions. In\r\nparticular, we continue to believe that the report should\r\ninclude a concise account of the Council’s informal\r\nconsultations on crisis areas, regional tensions,\r\nhumanitarian emergencies and other issues crucial to local\r\nand global stability. We look forward to further\r\nimprovements in the format and contents of the Security\r\nCouncil’s report to the General Assembly. For this\r\npurpose, a good basis for analysis and discussion is\r\nprovided by General Assembly resolution 51/193, adopted\r\nlast December.\r\nThe Italian delegation also wonders if the time has\r\nnot come to give serious consideration to ways and means\r\nof implementing Article 44 of the Charter. This Article\r\nstates that when the Security Council has decided to use\r\nforce, before calling upon a Member not represented in\r\nthe Council to provide armed forces, it shall invite that\r\nMember to participate in the decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil concerning the employment of contingents of that\r\nMember’s armed forces. We think that we need to ensure\r\nthat countries which are asked to risk the lives of their\r\nsoldiers — of their citizens — in peacekeeping operations\r\nare given a voice in the decision-making process of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nFinally, Article 24 of the Charter states that the\r\nMembers of the Organization:\r\n“confer on the Security Council primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and agree that\r\nin carrying out its duties under this\r\nresponsibility the Security Council acts on their\r\nbehalf”.\r\nThe transparency of the work of the Council vis-à-\r\nvis all members of the United Nations is no less\r\nimportant than the Council’s effectiveness in performing\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nits mandate. We are confident that today’s debate will\r\nreaffirm both values, in the interest of Member States,\r\nregional organizations and the United Nations as a whole.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): This discussion provides us with a further\r\nopportunity to follow up the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil, evaluate its work and consider whether the\r\nCouncil took note of our observations, responded to our\r\nproposals and implemented our requests. In its introduction,\r\nthe report states that the Council has introduced\r\nimprovements into the format of the report, rationalized its\r\ndocumentation and taken measures to make available draft\r\nresolutions to Member States that are not members of the\r\nCouncil, and organized briefings. Some may believe that\r\nthese measures are important, but we see nothing new in\r\nthem. They have not brought about the transparency on a\r\nbroad scale called for by Member States. Consequently, the\r\nreport remains a compilation of the official proceedings of\r\nthe Council throughout the year, which makes it difficult\r\nfor Member States to evaluate the work of the Council on\r\nthese bases.\r\nThe decisions and presidential statements are presented\r\nwithout any background information about the consultations\r\nsurrounding them or the causes leading to their adoption. It\r\nis very clear that the Security Council did not take into\r\nconsideration a request made emphatically and constantly\r\nby Member States with regard to increasing the number of\r\nplenary meetings and to limiting the scope of informal\r\nconsultations as strictly as possible. What causes us concern\r\nis that the Security Council still acts completely counter to\r\nthis way. Its report states that it convened 115 plenary\r\nmeetings, during which 52 resolutions were adopted and 54\r\npresidential statements issued. It also states that the Council\r\nmet in informal consultations for a total of over 342 hours.\r\nThe document we are discussing today contains no\r\ninformation about the substance of those consultations. This\r\nmeans that the Security Council either still persists in\r\nignoring our requests, or considers that what took place in\r\nits consultations is a secret that Members of the United\r\nNations that are not members of the Security Council are\r\nnot supposed to know, although the Council is supposed to\r\nact on their behalf. The document before us states that the\r\nCouncil undertook consultations during the period in which\r\nthree reviews of the sanctions imposed by Security Council\r\nresolution 748 (1992) took place. But the report does not\r\nreveal to us what took place during those consultations, the\r\nmost recent of which lasted for over two hours.\r\nWe should have liked the Assembly to know that,\r\nduring consultations, some States expressed their great\r\nappreciation for the positive initiatives of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya to resolve the conflict that took place as a\r\nresult of the Lockerbie incident, and that they appreciated\r\nand valued Libya’s flexibility in addressing the problem.\r\nWe hoped that the report would mention that some of the\r\nmembers of the Council supported proposals by the\r\nLeague of Arab States, the Organization of African Unity\r\nand the Non-Aligned Movement to put on trial those\r\nsuspected of having any link to the incident involving Pan\r\nAm flight 103. The report should have referred to the fact\r\nthat only two States rejected the request by other\r\nmembers of the Council, using the Council’s mechanism\r\nof the so-called consensus to obstruct the proposal that\r\nwould have brought about a swift resolution of the\r\nproblem and, accordingly, called for a lifting of the\r\nsanctions imposed on the Libyan people and brought to\r\nan end the anguish of the families of the victims.\r\nUndoubtedly there are other issues which are of\r\ninterest to other Members. These issues could have been\r\naddressed by the report with more clarity and in greater\r\ndetail. What we see before us is a simple briefing to the\r\nAssembly on the dates of the Council’s meetings, and a\r\nreproduction of statements and resolutions already\r\nadopted. This information is already known to Member\r\nStates, and may be of use to researchers and students, but\r\nit cannot be used by Member States as the basis for a\r\ndiscussion of the work of the Council and an evaluation\r\nof that work.\r\nArticle 31 of the Charter allows States that are not\r\nmembers of the Security Council to participate in the\r\ndiscussion of any question brought before the Council,\r\nwhenever such a State considers that its interests are\r\nspecially affected. This Article has been applied to\r\nplenary meetings, but not to the holding of informal\r\nconsultations, which have unfortunately become the real\r\nframework for decision-making. On the basis of our\r\nexperience with the Council, we believe that it has\r\nbecome necessary to undertake a reform of this practice.\r\nThis is because of our belief that those who drafted the\r\nCharter did not intend the application of that Article to be\r\nconfined only to plenary meetings, but to be extended to\r\nall meetings of the Security Council. Allowing concerned\r\nStates to participate in the Council’s consultations has\r\ngreat significance which becomes particularly apparent\r\nwhen the other party to the question under consideration\r\nis a member of the Security Council. This is the case with\r\nus at present. As is well known, my country was thrust\r\ninto conflict brought about by permanent members of the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nSecurity Council. During informal consultations of the\r\nCouncil, they are allowed to express their views, while we\r\nare prevented from doing so, in contravention of the letter\r\nand spirit of Article 31 of the Charter.\r\nThe rights of States that are not members of the\r\nCouncil to clarify their positions during consultations has\r\nbeen stressed by many Member States including, for\r\nexample, States in the Non-Aligned Movement. Today we\r\nreiterate this call and urge the swift implementation of this\r\nprinciple. Allowing a State to participate in a plenary\r\nmeeting after the Council has already made its decision\r\ncannot influence the decisions already taken. Consequently\r\nit is only a formalistic practice, designed to rubber-stamp\r\ndecisions already arrived at in camera and in secrecy which\r\nare totally unjustified.\r\nThe time has come for a drastic review of the working\r\nmethods of the Council and to consider ways and means of\r\nenhancing serious and veritable cooperation between it and\r\nthe General Assembly. We must undertake measures that\r\nwill guarantee clarity in its work, so as to ensure that this\r\norgan is not a tool used by certain States to further their\r\nown objectives. That is why we must undertake several\r\nsteps.\r\nFirst, we must review or substantively amend the\r\nannual report of the Council so that it includes a full\r\npresentation of the background to decisions adopted and\r\nstatements made by the Council. Furthermore, the report\r\nmust include details about the deliberations that took place\r\nduring consultations, together with more comprehensive\r\nreviews with regard to the work of the subsidiary organs of\r\nthe Council, particularly the sanctions committees.\r\nSecondly, the Council must follow proper work\r\nmethods in order to enable Member States to participate in\r\ndeliberations prior to the start of the decision-making\r\nprocess. Such States would then not find themselves\r\npresented with faits accomplis, the decisions already taken\r\nand their views with no influence on the outcome of the\r\ndeliberations.\r\nThirdly, the Council must broaden the basis of its\r\nconsultations with Member States and implement Article 31\r\nof the Charter with regard to States involved in issues\r\nwhich are before the Council in the context of informal\r\nconsultations.\r\nFourthly, the Security Council must enhance its\r\nrelations with the General Assembly and consult with it on\r\nhow to treat international issues, especially those relating to\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security. The Assembly’s\r\nrole should not be confined to the mere approval of\r\nfinancial allocations for peacekeeping operations.\r\nFifthly, the Security Council must clarify its terms\r\nof reference and the way in which it makes decisions and\r\narrives at positions. It must also make reference to\r\nCharter provisions, or any other legal principles, used in\r\nits decision-making process, with regard to every\r\nresolution or measure issuing from the Security Council.\r\nSixthly, it must find a mechanism that allows the\r\nGeneral Assembly to hold the Council accountable, so\r\nthat democracy can be guaranteed in its decision-making\r\nand double standards in its work can be avoided. We\r\nmust also guarantee that such acts conform to the\r\nprovisions of the Charter. This is extremely important,\r\nbecause some States have dragged the Council into\r\nsituations that are totally outside its purview and its\r\nmandate under the Charter.\r\nSeventhly, the work methods of the sanctions\r\ncommittees should be reviewed with a view to enabling\r\nMember States concerned to attend their meetings and to\r\nexpress their opinions and views on matters under\r\nconsideration. There must also be a review of the\r\nguidelines for the work of these committees so that\r\ndemocratic principles can apply to their decisions and\r\nrestrictions on applications submitted to these committees\r\ncan be avoided.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that the Council will give the\r\nproposals and observations which we and other several\r\nStates have made the attention they deserve, and that the\r\nCouncil will, without undue delay, start improving its\r\nmethods of work and those of its subsidiary bodies. This\r\nshould be the beginning of a serious reform process that\r\nwill guarantee transparency in its actions in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of the Charter, thereby responding to\r\nthe requests of Member States, on whose behalf the\r\nSecurity Council acts.\r\nMr. Gomaa (Egypt): Let me start by thanking\r\nAmbassador Juan Somavía, Permanent Representative of\r\nChile and President of the Security Council for the month\r\nof October, for his comprehensive presentation of the\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly\r\nthis year.\r\nAllow me also to thank the Security Council\r\nSecretariat for its efforts in preparing the report in a\r\ntimely manner that allowed its publication at an early\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nstage of the session, thus responding positively to the need\r\nfor its timely distribution which has always been a concern\r\nfor us.\r\nSince the discussion of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the fifty-first session of the General Assembly\r\nand the adoption of General Assembly resolution 51/193 on\r\nthis agenda item, the Security Council has taken some steps\r\ntowards improving the annual report of the Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, both in the descriptive and analytical\r\nparts. These steps are reflected in the note by the President\r\nof the Security Council which stated some agreed changes\r\nto be introduced into the report to be submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly covering the period from 16 June 1997\r\nto 15 June 1998. These changes, though minimal, give a\r\npositive impression about the orientation of the Council\r\ntowards more transparency and openness.\r\nThe most noticeable development in the note is that it\r\nopens the door for Presidents of the Security Council to\r\nprepare at the end of their presidency an assessment\r\nreflecting their evaluation of the work of the Council under\r\ntheir presidency. While we had hoped that these evaluations\r\nwould be approved by the Security Council itself, we\r\nwelcome this development as a first step, and hope that all\r\nPresidents of the Security Council will present these\r\nevaluations in a manner that could provide a complete\r\nevaluation of the year covered by the report.\r\nApart from these positive developments, there has\r\nbeen no progress in other aspects mentioned in General\r\nAssembly resolution 51/193.\r\nThe annual report before us, like those of previous\r\nyears, continues to present no more than a compilation of\r\ndocuments already provided to delegations, at the\r\nappropriate time, which constitutes a waste of effort,\r\nmaterial resources and time.\r\nIn our view, a comprehensive report should include\r\nthe following.\r\nFirst, it should contain a substantive, analytical and\r\ndescriptive part reflecting accurately the activities of the\r\nCouncil in the year under review.\r\nSecondly, for reasons of transparency, it should\r\ncontain a record not only of the formal meetings of the\r\nCouncil, but also of its informal meetings, where most of\r\nthe actions and decisions of the Council are agreed upon\r\nbefore being formally adopted, and which remain in total\r\nobscurity. Records are also needed for the formal and\r\ninformal meetings of the sanctions committees. The\r\nSecurity Council should periodically conduct an overall\r\nevaluation of sanctions regimes and their impact on the\r\npopulations in question as well as on third States affected\r\nby the imposition of sanctions. Also, an assessment of the\r\nresults obtained by implementation of sanctions would\r\nhelp in the evaluation of the effectiveness of such\r\nsanctions. In this regard, the working paper on An\r\nAgenda for Peace prepared by the General Assembly and\r\nadopted by consensus in resolution 51/242 gains particular\r\nimportance, as it reflects the general orientation of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in this matter.\r\nThirdly, it should contain a clear definition of the\r\npresidential statements and statements to the press and\r\ntheir value from the legal point of view, taking into\r\nconsideration the lack of any provisions regarding their\r\nvalidity in the provisional rules of procedures of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nBesides the annual report, the Security Council\r\nshould prepare and submit to the General Assembly\r\nspecial reports on specific situations, in accordance with\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter. In this regard, my delegation,\r\ntogether with the delegation of Indonesia, submitted to the\r\nSecurity Council in 1996, a non-exhaustive list defining\r\nsome of the cases in which the Security Council should\r\npresent special reports to the General Assembly. We\r\nbelieve that this proposal should receive the attention it\r\nmerits so as to promote the inter-relationship between the\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, without affecting the\r\nbalance established by the Charter between the two\r\norgans.\r\nMy delegation considers the exchange of information\r\nand views between the Security Council and the troop-\r\ncontributing countries a successful example that should\r\nenhance the work of the Council. We do not wish these\r\nmeetings to be transformed into routine or symbolic\r\noccasions, but to become a forum for candid and\r\ntransparent discussions on all issues related to specific\r\ntroops participating in peacekeeping operations. There are\r\nstill many ways and means to improve the relationship\r\nbetween troop-contributing countries and the Security\r\nCouncil. We urge the Security Council to continue its\r\nefforts in exploring additional measures that would help\r\nachieve a better relationship, which would certainly reflect\r\npositively on the performance of such troops. We stress\r\nin particular the need to involve troop-contributing\r\ncountries in the decision-making process more actively\r\nthan is at present the case. This we consider both a\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nstatutory responsibility and a pragmatic and rational\r\nnecessity.\r\nOther measures to improve transparency of the work\r\nof the Security Council on a daily basis should also be the\r\nfocus of our attention. Enhanced briefings by the presidency\r\nof the Council continue to be a viable option in this regard.\r\nAlso, transparency is required with regard to oral reports\r\npresented by the Secretariat to the Security Council. We\r\ncontinue to urge the Security Council to take full stock of\r\nvarious proposals made in this regard, including the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the reform and expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council, in order to agree on the most appropriate\r\nway to enhance the transparency with regard to the daily\r\nfunctions of the Council.\r\nEgypt is a few months away from the end of its term\r\nin the Security Council and is more convinced than ever of\r\nthe need for an annual report, as well as special reports\r\nwhich would establish a more transparent relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly.\r\nWe are sure that new non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council will carry on further development of its\r\nreporting mechanism to the General Assembly and will\r\nwork towards more transparency and openness. My\r\ndelegation stands ready to participate in any collective\r\neffort towards that end.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to\r\nAmbassador Somavía for introducing this report and for his\r\nconstant, daily efforts in this field.\r\nThe presentation of the report of the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly should constitute a model of\r\nsubstantive reflection and debate not only on the work of\r\nthe Council and the actions undertaken by that organ,\r\npresumably on behalf of all Member States, but also on\r\nexisting and potential challenges facing the Organization in\r\nthe sphere of maintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe requisite interaction between the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly is provided for in Article 24 of\r\nthe Organization’s Charter, which states that the Council\r\nshall submit annual and, when necessary, special reports to\r\nthe General Assembly for its consideration. At the same\r\ntime, by virtue of Article 15 of the Charter, the General\r\nAssembly shall receive and consider annual and special\r\nreports from the Security Council. The Charter also\r\nprovides that reports of the Security Council shall include\r\nan account of the measures that the Security Council has\r\ndecided upon or taken to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity. It is therefore clear that the role of the General\r\nAssembly and the 185 Member States is to monitor the\r\nactivities of the Security Council and, in the light of that\r\nexercise, to make recommendations, as they are\r\nauthorized to do pursuant to Chapter IV of the Charter.\r\nNevertheless, it must be pointed out that the report\r\nsubmitted by the Council to the General Assembly once\r\nagain constitutes a repetitious list of well-known\r\nresolutions and presidential statements adopted by the\r\nCouncil during the period in question and, unfortunately,\r\ndoes not include the necessary analyses of the root causes\r\nof the many and varied conflicts that the Security Council\r\nhas dealt with or the basic principles and norms that\r\nguided the Council’s actions.\r\nThere is no doubt that the voluminous format of the\r\nreport of the Security Council is intended to reflect in\r\nsome way the intensive work it has carried out in the past\r\nyear. Nevertheless, in the opinion of the delegation of\r\nCuba, a document like the report before the Assembly\r\ntoday is still of little use, and is valid only as a reference\r\ndocument. It is impossible to find in its pages, for\r\nexample, reasoned evidence that, in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the Security Council\r\nreally has acted on behalf of and represented all the\r\nOrganization’s Member States.\r\nOne of the main aspects of the report is that relating\r\nto the Security Council’s documentation. The delegation\r\nof Cuba recognizes that in recent years efforts have been\r\nmade to improve this aspect of the work of the Council.\r\nWe commend these efforts to the extent that they could\r\ncontribute to the necessary process of democratization and\r\ntransparency in the Council’s decision-making, procedures\r\nand working methods. Nonetheless, we believe that these\r\nmeasures should, whatever the circumstances, be\r\ncompatible with the principles enshrined in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and with the spirit of respect for and\r\nobservance of the rights and obligations recognized by the\r\nCharter, both of Member States and of the Security\r\nCouncil itself.\r\nWe continue to attach special importance to the\r\nprocess of preparing with Member States, and consulting\r\nthem on, the list of items under consideration by the\r\nCouncil. Transparency in this exercise should be the basic\r\npremise of the daily work of the Council, as well as a\r\nreflection of the Security Council’s recognition of its\r\nobligations towards the Organization’s vast membership.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nMy delegation has noted with concern that, yet again,\r\nthe report of the Security Council does not give any\r\ninformation on or analysis of the main trends that emerged\r\nduring its debates in this period. We believe that such an\r\nanalysis should be the starting point for the adoption of any\r\ndecision by the Security Council. The opinions expressed\r\nor the decisions promoted in informal consultations by just\r\nsome members of the Security Council, and in particular by\r\nsome of its permanent members, should not continue to\r\nvalidate the Council’s actions. Only substantive\r\nconsideration by the Council of the legitimate interests and\r\nconcerns expressed by Member States during the debates\r\ncan accurately guide the Council in its work and provide it\r\nwith the necessary and impartial information that will\r\nenable it to assess the real causes of conflicts, counteract\r\ntheir consequences and take action to find just and lasting\r\nsolutions, free from politically motivated prejudices and not\r\ndominated by the illegitimate interests of just one country\r\nor a small group of countries.\r\nDecisions adopted behind closed doors and ultimately\r\ndictated by the hegemonic and political interests of some\r\npermanent members of the Council have only led, and will\r\ncontinue to lead, to artificial formulas and solutions whose\r\njustification and effectiveness, sooner rather than later, have\r\nbeen and will continue to be overmatched by the real\r\ncauses of the conflicts.\r\nRecently, some degree of transparency has entered the\r\nwork of the sanctions committees of the Security Council,\r\nand their decision-making processes have become more\r\nindependent. Nonetheless, we believe that these bodies are\r\nstill bound by the designs of some permanent members of\r\nthe Council that continue to impose their interests on the\r\ndecision-making process, in total disregard for the opinion\r\nof the international community, the internal situation of the\r\ncountries that are subject to sanctions regimes and the\r\nresponse of those countries to the decisions and measures\r\napplied by the Council.\r\nIn this context, we would like to reiterate the view that\r\nthe annual report of the Security Council should contain a\r\nsubstantive assessment of the work of the sanctions\r\ncommittees, instead of confining itself to giving a factual\r\nlist of the resolutions and presidential statements adopted on\r\nthe question of sanctions or of the coercive measures\r\nadopted under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nOn many occasions, many Member States have\r\nadvocated special reports by the Security Council on\r\nmeasures that the Council has applied or decided to apply\r\nor in order to maintain international peace and security. In\r\nour opinion, in current international circumstances, when\r\nthe conflicts besetting the world are increasingly\r\nantagonistic and complex, the General Assembly must\r\nutilize, de facto and de jure, the powers and authority\r\nconferred upon it by the Charter.\r\nThe discussion of special reports of the Security\r\nCouncil would enable the General Assembly to stay duly\r\ninformed of the decisions and solutions that the Security\r\nCouncil is preparing to implement or has implemented in\r\nconnection with certain special issues, and it would give\r\nthe Assembly the chance to voice in timely fashion the\r\nopinions and recommendations it feels are necessary on\r\na particular conflict or on possible action by the Council.\r\nAs in previous years, the delegation of Cuba\r\nreiterates its willingness to participate actively and\r\nconstructively in the consideration of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly.\r\nAt present, the General Assembly is witnessing and\r\nparticipating in a process of reform of the Organization,\r\naimed, as the Secretary-General has said, at enabling the\r\nOrganization to meet the challenges of the day.\r\nThe Cuban delegation hopes that the work and\r\nactions of the Security Council, one of the principal\r\norgans of this Organization, entrusted with the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, will not\r\nbe exempted from the spirit, the scrutiny and the\r\nobjectives that inspire the process of reform.\r\nCuba also hopes that both in the consideration of the\r\nreport of the Security Council and in the process of\r\nreform, the wisdom and sovereign will of the General\r\nAssembly, the only universally representative organ of\r\nthis Organization, will receive due consideration.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (interpretation from Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to thank the President of the\r\nSecurity Council for introducing the Council’s annual report\r\nto the General Assembly.\r\nIn the past year the Security Council has done a lot of\r\nwork and made fresh efforts in maintaining international\r\npeace and security. This should be duly recognized. We\r\nhave also noted that starting this year, some alterations will\r\nbe made to the format of the report. These efforts are\r\nundoubtedly aimed at enhancing the transparency of the\r\nCouncil’s work. We hope that after such alterations, the\r\nreport will help Member States better understand the work\r\nof the Council for the period covered.\r\nIn the wake of the changes on the international scene,\r\nparticularly at this turn of the century, the Security Council,\r\nas a major organ of the United Nations, shoulders important\r\nresponsibilities for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, entrusted to it by the Charter. We hope that in\r\nfulfilling its responsibilities, the Council will fully heed the\r\nviews of Member States so as to act truly on behalf of the\r\nentire membership.\r\nHere I would like to make three points regarding the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\nFirst, for historical reasons and as a result of various\r\ncomplicated internal and external factors, there has been\r\nconstant turbulence and conflict in some parts of Africa in\r\nthe past year. We are of the view that the Council should\r\nattach importance to African issues and, in handling these\r\nissues, fully respect the sovereignty, political independence\r\nand territorial integrity of African countries; carefully\r\nconsider the reasonable proposals and demands of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and African countries; and\r\nsupport and cooperate with African countries in their efforts\r\nto maintain regional peace and security.\r\nPeace and development are interrelated and mutually\r\ncomplementary. Efforts by the Council in the field of\r\npeacekeeping alone are far from enough. The international\r\ncommunity should make greater efforts to bring about a\r\nfundamental solution to the question of development in\r\nAfrica so as to help African countries move out of poverty\r\nat an early date and achieve lasting peace and stability.\r\nSecondly, in recent years the Security Council has\r\nshown an obvious tendency to intervene in some countries’\r\ninternal conflicts. We are of the view that in handling these\r\nimportant and complicated issues, the Council should\r\nobserve the purposes and principles of the Charter, obtain\r\nthe request or consent of the States or parties concerned,\r\ndo its utmost to help resolve conflicts by peaceful means\r\nand encourage a proper role for regional organizations\r\naccording to specific circumstances. It is necessary to\r\nrefrain from practices such as interfering in a country’s\r\ninternal affairs under pretext of alleviating a humanitarian\r\ncrisis, or authorizing military intervention by wilfully\r\ninvoking Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nThirdly, we have noted that instances of sanctions\r\nbeing authorized by the Council have increased in the\r\npast year. In principle, we are not in favour of using\r\nsanctions to settle disputes, and still less of using\r\nsanctions as a means of exerting pressure or meting out\r\npunishment. We are of the view that rather than rendering\r\nany help in the settlement of disputes and conflicts,\r\nsanctions only bring suffering to the people of target\r\ncountries and cause economic loss and damage to third\r\ncountries implementing the sanctions. Resolution 51/242,\r\non sanctions, was adopted by consensus at the fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The principles set forth\r\nin that resolution should serve as guidelines for our\r\ndecision-making. In the few cases in which sanctions are\r\nnecessary, we should have a clear objective, scope and\r\ntime limit and should take humanitarian factors into full\r\nconsideration. It is not proper to impose sanctions readily\r\nwhile making it difficult to lift them.\r\nToday we are here to review the work of the\r\nCouncil and hear the views of Member States, with a\r\nview to helping the Council summarize its experience and\r\ndraw on our collective wisdom so that it can better fulfil\r\nthe mission entrusted to it by the Charter. We hope that\r\nwith the joint efforts of the general membership and the\r\nCouncil members, the Council will live up to the\r\nexpectations of the world’s people and make further\r\nprogress in maintaining international peace and security.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): Today’s discussion of\r\nthe report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly, comprehensively presented by Ambassador\r\nSomavía of Chile, once again clearly demonstrates the\r\nspecial level of attention which the Member States give\r\nto this key political body in the United Nations structure.\r\nIt goes without saying that membership in this\r\nauthoritative organ is considered to be an extremely\r\nimportant and honorary mission for each and every\r\nMember State. The growing competition for election to\r\nthe Council is yet another proof of that.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nAt the same time, the right to hold one’s finger on the\r\nplanet’s pulse is not just an honorary duty but is, first of\r\nall, tedious and strenuous work. This has been constantly\r\nproved by the essence of the issues considered by the\r\nSecurity Council and by its ability to prevent the further\r\nescalation of a number of conflicts before they entered an\r\nuncontrolled phase.\r\nAs recent positive examples of that, one may recall the\r\noperation of a multinational force in Albania and the\r\nassistance in holding free elections in Liberia and in\r\nBosnia.\r\nAt the same time, we should admit that, in spite of\r\nsubstantial efforts on the part of the Security Council, many\r\nacute problems have not yet found their solution and\r\ncontinue to endanger international peace and security.\r\nTherefore, it is absolutely necessary that the Security\r\nCouncil continue to concentrate its efforts on the remaining\r\nunresolved problems.\r\nI would also like to note some positive changes in the\r\norganization of the Security Council’s activities. The work\r\nof that body has definitely become more transparent, and its\r\nmethods, in our opinion, increasingly meet the requirements\r\nof the present time. We believe that the present report\r\nappropriately reflects this tendency, which is in conformity\r\nwith General Assembly resolution 51/193.\r\nIn this context, we must note the introduction of\r\norientation discussions held before the Security Council’s\r\nadoption of responsible decisions. The participation of the\r\ninterested parties in such discussions not only makes it\r\npossible to consider the problem in a comprehensive\r\nmanner, but also provides for a search for optimal ways to\r\nachieve its solution.\r\nOur delegation also notes with satisfaction the steady\r\nimprovement of the mechanism of periodical consultations\r\nbetween contributing States, members of the Security\r\nCouncil and the United Nations Secretariat. This useful\r\npractice should be further developed. The Security Council\r\nshould always be prepared to arrange such consultations at\r\nthe request of potential contributing States in the event of\r\nemergency situations.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine also fully supports the idea\r\nof introducing into the work of the Security Council the\r\npractice of preparing monthly reports on the outcome of\r\nthat month’s presidency, since this would contribute to the\r\nanalytical essence of its report to the General Assembly. To\r\nthis end, we propose to request the Council’s working\r\ngroup on documentation, methods of work and procedure\r\nnot only to study the issue of the preparation of the\r\nCouncil’s annual report, but also to elaborate relevant\r\nproposals with regard to the practical implementation of\r\nsuch a concept.\r\nFinally, I would like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the need to establish a closer interaction\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly,\r\nwhich would potentially improve the efficiency of the\r\nactivities both of the Security Council and of the entire\r\nUnited Nations membership. We strongly believe that the\r\npractice begun at the beginning of this session of the\r\nAssembly of regular meetings between the President of\r\nthe General Assembly and the President of the Security\r\nCouncil should become regular. We would also\r\nrecommend that such meetings be attended by the\r\nSecretary-General. Such meetings of the United Nations\r\ntroika — a format successfully applied with reference to\r\nthe activities of such recognized regional structures as the\r\nEuropean Union and the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) — could also be\r\ninstrumental in the case of the United Nations.\r\nAcceptance and implementation of such a proposal would,\r\nin our view, serve to fulfil our desire to make the United\r\nNations more effective and able to withstand the\r\nchallenges of the present time.\r\nI hope that the current discussion of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council and the proposals of Members will help\r\nthat body better to fulfil its major mandate of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Eitel (Germany): Germany welcomes the\r\npresentation of the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and thanks the Council President,\r\nAmbassador Juan Somavía of Chile, for his introductory\r\nremarks. The report reflects the vast agenda the Council\r\nhad to deal with between June 1996 and June 1997. The\r\nmere numbers tell us enough: 115 formal meetings held;\r\n52 resolutions adopted; 54 presidential statements issued.\r\nThe main questions considered by the Council were\r\nrelated to the former Yugoslavia, Angola, the Great Lakes\r\nregion, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Burundi, Iraq and\r\nKuwait and Tajikistan — without ignoring the importance\r\nof the many other issues the Council had to deal with.\r\nMost of these facts are familiar. I will therefore not\r\nelaborate on them, but rather draw attention to three\r\nsimple questions. First, has the presentation of the report\r\nchanged since last year? Secondly, is there room for\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nfurther improvement? Thirdly, are there links between the\r\nreport and Security Council reform?\r\nI begin with changes since last year. Many of us still\r\nremember the widespread dissatisfaction expressed in\r\nprevious years in the General Assembly regarding the\r\nreport’s format and contents. With this in mind, the General\r\nAssembly on 17 December 1996 adopted a resolution\r\n(51/193) on the report containing various recommendations\r\nto improve the interaction between Council and Assembly.\r\nThis year’s report demonstrates positive changes. It is again\r\nshorter, and it is presented earlier.\r\nIn reply to the second question, there is surely a strong\r\nneed for further improvement in the report. A possible\r\nsilver lining seems to be the agreement among Security\r\nCouncil members to take up some of the main concerns of\r\nthe General Assembly and to include background lists; a\r\ndescription in chronological order of Council consideration\r\nand action; information regarding subsidiary organs of the\r\nCouncil such as sanctions committees; and information\r\nregarding documentation, working methods and procedures\r\nof the Council. The commitments are contained in the\r\npresidential note (S/1997/451) of 12 June this year.\r\nFrom an analytic point of view, the most far-reaching\r\nfuture element will be the assessments of the work of the\r\nCouncil prepared by the respective Presidents of the\r\nSecurity Council and attached as an addendum to the\r\nreport. Ambassador Monteiro of Portugal deserves credit for\r\nhaving given much thought to this new instrument for\r\nopenness and transparency of the Council and for having\r\nset an early and voluntary example of a presidential\r\nassessment. The Republic of Korea, Sweden and the United\r\nKingdom have also submitted assessments since then. All\r\nof them deserve applause and credit for providing analytic\r\nelements to the reports. If this direction is followed, the\r\nreport may become a truly helpful instrument for more\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council.\r\nThirdly, the links between Security Council reform\r\nand our agenda item — the report of the Security\r\nCouncil — are quite clear. The report is frequently\r\nmentioned in proposals for Security Council reform. For\r\ninstance, the “full-picture” proposal of the previous\r\nPresident of the General Assembly (A/51/47, annex II)\r\ndevotes an entire paragraph to the report. But, as is the\r\ncase with other documents, it is only one out of many\r\npoints of the reform package, from number of seats to\r\nelections to the veto right to transparency and working\r\nmethods. Only the full range of these measures will\r\nfinally bring about Security Council reform as we would\r\nlike to see it, with a new team, a new spirit of work, new\r\nresources and new approaches.\r\nThanks to a surprising initiative taken last week,\r\nthere is again currently much talk at the United Nations\r\nabout Security Council reform. That initiative, which was\r\nsponsored by, among others, the champions of\r\ntransparency, was submitted — as far as my delegation is\r\nconcerned — out of the blue and without earlier\r\ndiscussion in the Open-ended Working Group. We shall\r\nhave to adapt to this new style.\r\nEven the best possible report of the Council will\r\nremain an insufficient instrument of transparency if the\r\nOrganization does not take on the challenge of including\r\nit in the full picture of Security Council reform. Let us\r\ngive the Security Council more tools and more people to\r\nuse them smoothly. Let us not lean back and expect\r\nreform to happen. It has to be brought about. Germany\r\nwill continue to work with other Members towards that\r\nend.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
