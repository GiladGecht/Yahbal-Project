(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/52/2)\r\nMr. Amorim (Brazil): I wish to thank the current\r\nPresident of the Security Council, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Chile, for having presented this year’s\r\nreport (A/52/2) on the Council’s activity with his usual\r\neloquence and brilliance. The improvements that have been\r\nintroduced into the annual reports in recent years deserve to\r\nbe acknowledged as a positive development from the point\r\nof view of the enhancement of transparency and\r\naccountability in the Council’s work, which has come to\r\nrepresent a universally shared objective.\r\nIndeed, with the intensification of the Council’s work\r\nduring the present decade, such improvements in reporting\r\nhave become not only desirable, but indispensable. They\r\nshould be seen as part of an ongoing process which should,\r\nhopefully, dovetail with the results of the discussions on the\r\nso-called cluster II issues being dealt with in the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation for the\r\nefforts of individual delegations in keeping States members\r\nthat are not in the Council as well briefed as possible on\r\nwhat goes on during the informal consultations. We wish to\r\nthank in particular all those former Council Presidents\r\nwho have taken up the responsibility of circulating a\r\nsummary of the activity during their presidencies. The\r\npioneer role of the Ambassador of Portugal in this respect\r\ndeserves a special word of recognition.\r\nThe period covered by the latest report has been one\r\nof mixed results in terms of the Council’s capacity to\r\neffectively deal with the different sources of instability\r\naround the world. In certain regions the Council seems to\r\nhave been able to assist in containing violence, and even\r\nin reversing it. Central America is a case in point. With\r\nthe successful conclusion of the military observer Mission\r\nin Guatemala, the definitive ceasefire between the\r\nGovernment and the URNG has established the necessary\r\nconditions for the promotion of peace and development in\r\na subregion of the Americas which has been particularly\r\nvulnerable to pernicious blends of internal strife and\r\nexternal interference. We are pleased to note that the\r\nentire isthmus today is making important strides in its\r\nstruggle for the creation of better living conditions for its\r\ninhabitants, and that integration on the basis of shared\r\nvalues is progressing.\r\nUnfortunately, the same degree of confidence can\r\nstill not be expressed with regard to the situation in Haiti.\r\nThe United Nations presence in Haiti has helped to\r\nimprove the security situation in the country and\r\ncontributed to the training of a national police force. But\r\nin the absence of clearer signs of economic rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction — for which the decided support of\r\nthe international community is essential — the Security\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nCouncil will have difficulty in placing that country on a\r\nsustained path to full institutional recovery. Hopefully, this\r\nCaribbean nation, for which Brazilians feel a natural\r\naffinity, will be able to build upon the relative stability of\r\nthe past three years and soon cease to be dealt with in the\r\ncontext of United Nations efforts for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe look forward to the elimination of the last item on\r\nthe Council’s agenda dealing with a situation in the\r\nAmericas, as a reflection of the democratic renaissance in\r\nour part of the world. It is worth mentioning in this regard\r\nthat with the recent entry into force of the Protocol of\r\nWashington to the Charter of the Organization of American\r\nStates, the hemisphere will have at its disposal a strong\r\ninstrument for dealing with threats to democratically elected\r\nGovernments.\r\nAn inordinate amount of the Council’s attention has\r\nbeen focused on Africa in the past year. The recent\r\nministerial meeting of the Council, which took place under\r\nthe presidency of the United States, constituted a timely and\r\nuseful exercise in assessing present trends in a continent\r\nwhich is undergoing momentous transformations. The\r\nsummit meeting of the Organization of African Unity\r\nearlier this year was hailed by many as an event which\r\nsignalled a new era of growing cooperation among a\r\ngeneration of leaders determined to face up to the many\r\nchallenges confronting them. The Security Council must\r\nlearn how to tap the new political resources that have\r\nemerged in the wake of the dismantling of apartheid in\r\nAfrica and must work closely with those leaders who have\r\ncommitted themselves to peace and democracy. Needless to\r\nsay, this comparatively favourable political climate could be\r\nshort-lived if the international community were to dedicate\r\nexclusive attention to security matters and show\r\nindifference to the continent’s many difficulties in the social\r\nand economic realm.\r\nA number of positive developments in some parts of\r\nAfrica coexist with others that still give cause for concern.\r\nIn Liberia, a successful electoral process has allowed the\r\ntermination of the mandate of the United Nations Observer\r\nMission in Liberia, and the prospects for reconciliation are\r\nthe best in years. In Western Sahara, progress is being\r\nmade towards the fulfilment of the conditions for the\r\nholding of a referendum, with an active role being played\r\nby the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. James\r\nBaker.\r\nAngola remains a source of considerable concern for\r\nmy Government. The imposition of additional sanctions on\r\nthe party which has consistently failed to meet its\r\nobligations under the Lusaka Protocol had become\r\nunavoidable. As a major contributor of troops to the\r\nUnited Nations Angola Verification Mission in its various\r\nformats, and as a sister lusophone nation, Brazil cannot\r\nbut underline its deep unease in the face of the seemingly\r\nendless tension in Angola, and once again professes its\r\nintention to continue to support serious efforts at bringing\r\nabout the necessary conditions for peace and prosperity\r\nfor all Angolans.\r\nHaving touched on the subject of action under\r\nChapter VII, I would like to note that we have been\r\nfollowing with concern the tendency to place internal\r\nsituations that do not have an obvious impact on regional\r\nor international security into that framework. Not long\r\nago, it was said that the international press was\r\nresponsible for placing items on the Council’s agenda,\r\nand certain representatives commented, not entirely in\r\njest, that the Cable News Network (CNN) had become the\r\nsixteenth member of the Security Council. More recently,\r\nhowever, we have come to witness a different\r\nphenomenon, with situations that have never been on the\r\nfront page of major newspapers being placed in the\r\ncontext of the framework reserved by the Charter for the\r\nmost serious threats to international peace and security.\r\nWe would have preferred, for example, that the regional\r\naction which has been authorized by the Council to\r\nimprove security conditions in the Central African\r\nRepublic had been placed in the context of the pacific\r\nsettlement of disputes. Action under Chapter VII, whether\r\nof a non-military nature such as sanctions or involving the\r\nuse of force, must remain an option of last resort, to be\r\ncontemplated only when all efforts to salvage peace\r\nthrough diplomacy and peacekeeping carried out with the\r\nconsent of the parties have clearly failed. The\r\ninternational community should resist lowering the\r\nthreshold for invoking Chapter VII and prevent careless\r\nresort to coercive measures from endangering the\r\nCouncil’s credibility.\r\nThe extremely violent conflicts that erupted in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia at the beginning of this decade are still\r\nproducing repercussions in the newly independent\r\nrepublics of the Balkans. There are lessons to be learned\r\nfrom the Council’s initial lack of a coherent plan for\r\ndealing with the Balkan tragedy, and the implementation\r\nof the Dayton peace plan has yet to establish itself as the\r\nirreversible blueprint for reconciliation in Bosnia. The\r\nSecurity Council retains a fundamental role in keeping the\r\nsituation in the Balkans under close scrutiny in the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nmonths ahead, in close coordination with all other efforts\r\nbeing carried out in the region.\r\nBrazil will be returning to the Security Council next\r\nJanuary for its eighth two-year period as a non-permanent\r\nmember. We wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to discharge this responsibility in full\r\ncompliance with our traditional adherence to the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter, and as a nation which has\r\nlived in peace with all of its 10 neighbours for more than\r\n120 years. We also wish to express our intention to do our\r\nutmost to live up to the trust the General Assembly has\r\nonce again placed in us by remaining in close contact with\r\nnon-members, individually and in groups, and by building\r\nupon the work of the many who have been trying to\r\nenhance the Council’s transparency and accountability in\r\nrecent years. We will devote particular attention to devising\r\nappropriate channels for close and continuous\r\ncommunication with our Latin American and Caribbean\r\nfriends in order to adequately reflect their concerns, to the\r\nextent possible, and to keep them apprised of the Council’s\r\ndecision-making process. As a country with a solid record\r\nof consensus building, we look forward to collaborating\r\nwith other Council members in translating the expectations\r\nraised by the end of the cold war into a more peaceful and\r\ncooperative international environment for all.\r\nLet me conclude with some brief observations on the\r\nimportant subject of Security Council expansion. After four\r\nyears of intensive discussion in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council and\r\nOther Matters Related to the Security Council, the process\r\nof Security Council reform has gained momentum in the\r\npast year through transparent deliberations that benefitted\r\ngreatly from firm leadership. The issues are now well\r\nknown. The creation of artificial procedural obstacles to\r\nSecurity Council reform through delaying tactics and\r\nsurprise manoeuvres is not constructive. That is a mistaken\r\npath that does not lead to the more representative and\r\nlegitimate Security Council that the great majority of the\r\nUnited Nations membership, in the developing world in\r\nparticular, desires.\r\nMr. Legwaila (Botswana): We have studied the report\r\nof the Security Council to the General Assembly with great\r\nattention, and we would like to thank all the members of\r\nthe Council for their determined effort to foster peace and\r\nsecurity around the world. The report underscores the\r\nremarkable progress that has been achieved by the\r\ninternational community in bringing peace and stability to\r\nseveral regions of the world.\r\nPeace and tranquillity, however fragile and feeble,\r\nnow prevail in the Balkans thanks to the unremitting\r\nefforts of the international community. The Security\r\nCouncil, in its wisdom, has established that the continued\r\npresence of international peacekeepers both in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and in eastern Croatia is indispensable for\r\nthe creation of an atmosphere conducive to peaceful\r\ndialogue and reconciliation in the Balkans. The Council\r\nhas recognized that there is still much work to be done\r\nbefore the Balkan peace process can reach the point of\r\nirreversibility. The Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia\r\ncontinues to serve with distinction, and its efforts should\r\nbe encouraged. Similarly, in eastern Croatia, the United\r\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\r\nBaranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) has been able\r\nto disarm and demobilize the combatants, and substantial\r\nprogress has consequently been made in the peace process\r\nin the area.\r\nEverything points to a promising future in Haiti\r\nbecause of the determination of the international\r\ncommunity to consolidate democratic rule in that\r\nCaribbean nation. The recent political wrangles should not\r\nbe allowed to disturb the new-found peace in Haiti. In the\r\nfinal analysis, however, it is the people of Haiti\r\nthemselves who must strive tirelessly to deepen the roots\r\nof their hard-earned democracy through national\r\nreconciliation and the denunciation of a culture of\r\nimpunity.\r\nEarlier this year, when fighting flared up in Albania,\r\nthe Security Council moved quickly and in a timely\r\nmanner to put out the flames of war that could have\r\nengulfed the whole region. It adopted resolution 1101\r\n(1997), which authorized the intervention of a\r\nmultinational protection force in Albania. We wish such\r\nexpeditious action could become the hallmark of the\r\nCouncil in all — I repeat, all — conflict situations.\r\nAfrica has clearly been less fortunate in receiving\r\nequally vigorous commitments to the resolution of its\r\nconflicts than other parts of the world. During the two\r\nyears that my country served in the Security Council,\r\nfrom 1995 to 1996, it was evident that lack of a resolute\r\nresponse by the Council to international conflict situations\r\ncould have long-term disastrous consequences. This was\r\nclearly demonstrated in Central Africa, where the conflict\r\nwhich erupted in Rwanda in 1994 was allowed to\r\nsmoulder unchecked until it degenerated into a genocidal\r\nconflagration.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nThe situation has worsened, and the region is now\r\nengulfed in hostilities which have claimed one Government\r\nafter another. It is not clear where the vortex is headed, or\r\nif it is stoppable. Something needs to be done before every\r\ncountry in the subregion is consumed by this political and\r\nmilitary whirlwind. The Council has missed many\r\nopportunities to prevent the conflict from spreading and\r\nthreatening the security of the entire subregion. If nothing\r\nis done — and urgently — to arrest the situation at this\r\nstage, we may be awakened by violence of unmitigated\r\nproportions tomorrow. We do not believe there is a\r\nMember State of this Organization which would like to\r\nwitness that eventuality.\r\nJust recently the Council watched with shocking\r\nindifference as the people of Congo (Brazzaville) were\r\nplunged into a bloodbath. The insistence by the Council\r\nthat the Congolese militias should declare and observe a\r\nceasefire before the United Nations could deploy\r\npeacekeeping forces at the airport in Brazzaville was, in our\r\nview, bereft of a sense of responsibility by an organ of this\r\nOrganization whose responsibility it is to maintain peace\r\nand security in the world, Africa included.\r\nThe Security Council should apply uniform criteria to\r\nall conflict situations around the world. Merely appealing\r\nto the conflicting parties to exercise restraint and resolve\r\ntheir differences peacefully, as has been the case with the\r\nrecent conflicts in Central Africa, is obviously not enough.\r\nThis approach has not worked.\r\nThe time has come to address the problems of the\r\nsubregion squarely and concretely, including ending the\r\nconflicts themselves, the restoration of democratic rule,\r\nrespect for international humanitarian law and protection of\r\nhuman rights. The Security Council cannot, unfortunately,\r\nafford to remain indifferent to situations in which\r\ndemocratically elected Governments are overthrown with\r\nreckless impunity and in situations in which there is not one\r\niota of respect for the sanctity of human life.\r\nWhen the General Assembly considered the report of\r\nthe Security Council last year, my delegation was among\r\nthose which were not happy with the descriptive nature of\r\nthe report. It is unfortunate that the report is still being\r\npresented in the same fashion this year. As it is, the report\r\ndoes not give the reader a clear picture of the activities of\r\nthe Council in the past year. We believe that there are ways\r\nin which the operations of the Council could become more\r\nopen and transparent, without compromising the\r\neffectiveness of the Council. A more succinct report could\r\nbe one of the ways. In the circumstances, it is evident that\r\nSecurity Council reform, in all its permutations, is the\r\nimperative of our times. It is only through reform that the\r\nnature and format of the report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly, among others, could assume the\r\nsemblance of an informative and action-oriented\r\ndocument. The Council has to be attuned to present-day\r\ninternational realities if it is to remain relevant and\r\nresponsive to the hopes and aspirations of humankind for\r\nworld peace today. We have to move to the negotiations\r\nstage in the Security Council reform process.\r\nMr. Crighton (Australia): I have listened with great\r\ninterest to earlier statements under this agenda item, and\r\nI must say that in many of them I find a strong resonance\r\nwith the views of the Australian delegation. I refer in\r\nparticular to those views relating to the importance of\r\ngreater openness and transparency in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nI would like in particular to record Australia’s\r\nappreciation for the efforts of the Republic of Korea and\r\nother Security Council members that have made a special\r\neffort to respond to the needs of the broader membership.\r\nI was particularly struck by Ambassador Park Soo Gil’s\r\nreference to the “loungers” — that is, the people who\r\nhave to mill around outside the room hoping for scraps to\r\nfall from the lips of those who have left the deliberations.\r\nI would like to make just two key points this\r\nafternoon. First of all, we note and we substantially agree\r\nwith the concerns many have raised with regard to the\r\nusefulness of the annual report. Now, this is a very\r\nimportant vehicle for providing information that non-\r\nmembers have every right, I think, to expect. Therefore,\r\nwe welcome the changes that have been foreshadowed for\r\nnext year’s report, as outlined in the note of the President\r\nof the Council on 12 June 1997.\r\nWe are also particularly pleased by the monthly\r\nassessments, an innovation introduced by the Portuguese\r\nPresident of the Council, which we applaud. They will\r\nnow be made an addendum to the annual report. The new\r\nmonthly assessments began in July, are a work in\r\ndevelopment, and they provide useful background\r\ninformation on the development of issues that are debated\r\nin the Council. These monthly assessments, I think, are a\r\npositive contribution to the principles of openness and\r\ntransparency.\r\nThe second point I would like to make is that\r\nAustralia agrees with the importance other delegations\r\nhave placed on the briefings given by the President of the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nCouncil following informal meetings. The briefings, which\r\nare an essential element in the implementation of the\r\nprinciple of openness and transparency, are to us a very\r\nimportant source of information. That is why it is vital that\r\nthese briefings are as detailed as possible, and also that they\r\ntake place promptly. Australia — and I am sure many other\r\ndelegations — would like to see a more systematic and\r\nstructured arrangement for these briefings — in other\r\nwords, to meet the needs of the people we referred to as\r\n“the loungers”.\r\nSome delegations earlier and elsewhere have pointed\r\nto the fact that these briefings are a two-way process. To\r\nthat extent, those delegations are quite right to point out\r\nthat in some cases the briefings are not well attended.\r\nHowever, I think the representative of Malaysia made a\r\nvery good point this morning, when he said that the lack of\r\ninterest may, at least in part, be due to the fact that these\r\nbriefings are either not sufficiently detailed or they do not\r\ngo beyond what is given earlier in the day to the media. I\r\nthink we can do a little better than that, and we would like\r\nto see something a little more structured and better targeted\r\nto the needs of the Members of this place, rather than to\r\nthose of the media.\r\nThere are, of course, I hasten to add, many exceptions,\r\nand Australia wishes to thank those members of the\r\nSecurity Council that have made a conscientious effort to\r\nkeep the general membership informed and involved. We\r\nthank them very much for that.\r\nIn summary, some progress is being made to pursue\r\ngreater openness and transparency, and Australia and, I am\r\nsure, the rest of us very much welcome that. We hope that\r\nwe can build on that and we look forward to a better\r\nprocess in the future.\r\nMr. Konishi (Japan): My delegation welcomes this\r\nopportunity to consider the report of the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly covering the period from 15 June\r\n1996 to 14 June 1997. My delegation wishes to express its\r\nappreciation to Ambassador Somavía, President of the\r\nCouncil this month, for his lucid and concise introduction\r\nof the report. As a member of the Council, Japan is pleased\r\nto associate itself with his presentation.\r\nAt the outset, I should like to emphasize that Japan\r\nattaches great importance to improving the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council. In particular, my\r\ndelegation has consistently supported strengthening the\r\nrelations between the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly and enhancing the transparency of the Security\r\nCouncil. It was precisely for this purpose, for example,\r\nthat when Japan assumed the presidency of the Security\r\nCouncil last January, it held daily briefings on the work\r\nof the Council for interested States that were not\r\nmembers. It has made this position clear in the course of\r\ndiscussions on Security Council reform. At the same time,\r\nJapan stresses that improving relations between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly should be\r\ndealt with as part of a comprehensive package that also\r\naddresses the issues of the composition and expansion of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nSince becoming a member of the Council in January,\r\nJapan has been participating actively in its intensive\r\ndiscussions on this issue. In June an agreement was\r\nreached to the effect that in future years the Council’s\r\nreport to the General Assembly would be made in a new\r\nformat. As Ambassador Somavía has explained in detail,\r\nthe report would contain concrete reform measures, with\r\nbrief assessments, by Permanent Representatives who\r\nhave served as Presidents of the Security Council,\r\nattached as an addendum. Japan recognized that this\r\nagreement, which responded to the calls of many\r\ncountries for improving the report of the Security\r\nCouncil, represented a significant step forward. The\r\nSecurity Council has decided once again to continue\r\nstudying and reviewing this issue with a view to further\r\nimproving its documents and procedures. For its part,\r\nJapan will continue to support that worthy endeavour.\r\nIn closing, I should like to recall the main objective\r\nof reform, which is to strengthen the functions of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. An essential means of\r\nachieving that end is to render the activities of the\r\nSecurity Council more effective by enhancing its work\r\nmethods — including its relations with the General\r\nAssembly — and by expanding and reforming it. I wish\r\nto assure you, Mr. President, that Japan is committed to\r\nthe attainment of these goals so as to ensure that the\r\nCouncil has the capacity to discharge its responsibilities\r\nfor the maintenance of world peace and security, as\r\nprescribed in the United Nations Charter.\r\nMr. Monteiro (Portugal): The President of the\r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador Somavía, has already\r\noutlined the main elements in the present report of the\r\nCouncil and has pointed out relevant questions addressed\r\nduring the period under consideration regarding the\r\nimprovement of the methods of work of the Council.\r\nPortugal welcomes the decision taken by the Council\r\nas a result of which, starting next year, a new type of\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nannual report from the Security Council will be submitted\r\nto the General Assembly. The new type of report will\r\ninclude a more user-friendly analytical description of the\r\nCouncil’s work, and brief monthly assessments by former\r\nPresidents of the Council will be attached to the report as\r\nan addendum.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to have contributed to this\r\noutcome of the discussions entered into by Council\r\nmembers this year in the informal working group on\r\ndocumentation and procedural questions. We believe that\r\nthis is not only a serious response from the Council to the\r\nspecific measures requested by General Assembly\r\nresolution 51/193, but also a positive step towards\r\nenhancing the transparency of the Council.\r\nThis is a dynamic evolutionary process, and more can\r\ncertainly be done. For example, since last year the annual\r\nreport has contained references to the activities of the\r\nsanctions committees. It seems reasonable, therefore, to\r\nexpect the reports of these committees to be attached to the\r\nannual report of the Security Council.\r\nAs Portugal has been a member of the Council since\r\nJanuary, my delegation is now in a position to consider the\r\npractice of the Council from an inside perspective and has\r\nsubmitted to Council members a number of its own\r\nobservations for discussion. One concerns the manner in\r\nwhich the decision-making process of the Council is\r\npresently developed in informal meetings, the so-called\r\nconsultations of the whole. In our experience, the\r\nprevalence of informal consultations has not brought\r\nsubstantial gains in expediting the Council’s work or\r\nmaking it more efficient. Rather, it has made the Council\r\nless transparent and has widened the gap between the\r\nCouncil and the rest of the membership.\r\nInformal consultations can and should take place\r\nwhenever necessary to assist members in the consideration\r\nof certain matters, as occurs in any other United Nations\r\nbody. But they should not systematically replace regular\r\nformal sessions of the Council, at which members should\r\nstate their views on the matters under consideration and\r\nhear other United Nations Members, if the Council so\r\ndecides. On the other hand, according to the Charter and\r\nthe existing provisional rules of procedure, the Council can\r\nalways meet in private formal sessions whenever\r\nconfidentiality is required. Clearly, in this matter, a balance\r\nmust be found.\r\nIn fact, the main distinctive element that distinguishes\r\nformal meetings from informal consultations of the whole\r\nis the fact that in the latter there are no written records.\r\nWe believe that dispensing with written records, which is\r\ncurrently the established practice because most of the\r\nwork is conducted in informal meetings, does not\r\ncontribute to the enhancement of the credibility of the\r\nCouncil. Records not only promote the consistency of\r\nSecurity Council decisions, but also assert the\r\nresponsibility of each member, thus ensuring their\r\naccountability before the entire United Nations\r\nmembership.\r\nFormal sessions, public or private, with written\r\nrecords, will improve transparency. According to the\r\nCharter, all United Nations Members are entitled to\r\nfollow closely the Council’s activities. Not only should\r\nthey be able to obtain information directly by attending\r\nregular formal sessions, but they should also have access\r\nto reliable written records, including those of sessions\r\nheld in private, if their particular interest is recognized by\r\nthe Council.\r\nIn our view, the current practice by which non-\r\nmembers of the Council gather information at the end of\r\nconsultations of the whole is most improper. Information\r\ncan be easily manipulated or is one-sided. Unfortunately,\r\na majority of United Nations Members choose this way of\r\ngathering information, instead of attending the\r\npresidency’s daily briefings, which should be truly\r\ninformative.\r\nAnother way to increase the contribution of the\r\nentire United Nations membership to the activities and\r\ndecisions of the Council, as other delegations have\r\nstressed, would be to ensure active participation by troop-\r\ncontributing countries in the decision-making phase of the\r\nCouncil’s deliberations regarding peacekeeping or peace-\r\nenforcement operations. We are not alone in our\r\ndissatisfaction with the manner in which meetings of\r\ntroop-contributing countries are now conducted.\r\nOne other related aspect, which my delegation has\r\nalso brought to the attention of the Council and which is\r\ncurrently under discussion in the informal working group\r\non documentation and procedural questions, concerns the\r\nuse — or rather, the misuse — that has been made of the\r\nso-called Arria formula meetings.\r\nWe realize that, somehow, inaccurate ideas have\r\nspread among the United Nations membership, even\r\namong Council members, on this extremely useful\r\nmechanism. The value of the Arria formula meetings lies\r\nprecisely in the informal and flexible manner of\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nchannelling information and input from essentially non-\r\nState actors directly into the Council. The most\r\nauthoritative source on this formula for meetings — its\r\ncreator, Ambassador Diego Arria — confirmed recently to\r\nCouncil members, at an Arria-style meeting organized by\r\nPortugal, that this was what the formula was designed for,\r\nstarting with guests such as a Bosnian priest, a British\r\nparliamentarian on the situation of the Iraqi marsh\r\npopulation, and a representative of the non-governmental\r\norganization Africa Watch.\r\nYet in the lists of Arria formula meetings, which we\r\nwere able to trace back to 1993, when they started, we find\r\nat least 10 heads of state and government and over 15\r\nministers among them. That means that almost 60 per cent\r\nof all guests, so far, have been representatives of States or\r\nGovernments. Did they all prefer the Arria formula,\r\nknowing that there would be no written records? Were they\r\nfully aware of the implications of that informal format?\r\nWhy were they not accorded formal meetings of the\r\nCouncil, as provided for by Articles 31 and 32 of the\r\nCharter and rules 37 and 38 of the provisional rules of\r\nprocedure?\r\nWe will be pleased to share with interested delegations\r\na paper with more detailed Portuguese views on the use and\r\nmerits of the Arria formula, which we find to be a tool with\r\nextraordinary potential. Here, I would just like to stress that\r\nwe believe that Arria-style meetings should be used\r\nwhenever there is a need to preserve informality. They are\r\ninformal by nature. We should not, therefore, attempt to\r\ncreate norms to regulate them. They have their own\r\nfunction within the informal activities of Security Council\r\nmembers. But, their use should not preclude the utilization\r\nof other formal mechanisms provided for by the Charter\r\nand the provisional rules of procedure.\r\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security Council,\r\nPortugal shares with the majority of United Nations\r\nMembers a particular concern with the transparency of the\r\nCouncil. Indeed, in this respect, our experience in the\r\nSecurity Council since last January has led us to conclude\r\nhow crucial it is to promote a serious review of the\r\nworking methods of the Council if we really wish to\r\nstrengthen its transparency, credibility and efficiency. This\r\nis particularly decisive at a moment when the enlargement\r\nof the Security Council is very much on the agenda of the\r\nglobal reform of the United Nations. Let us not have any\r\nillusions: if its methods of work remain the same, the\r\nCouncil’s enlargement will not, by itself, bring about a\r\nmore efficient, accountable and credible organ.\r\nMs. Donde Odinga (Kenya): My delegation\r\nwelcomes this year’s report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, contained in document A/52/2, and we\r\nare grateful to the President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Somavía of Chile, for introducing it. During\r\nthis period, Kenya was elected to a two-year term on the\r\nSecurity Council beginning in January 1997.\r\nThe submission of an annual report by the Security\r\nCouncil has become a useful exercise which enables the\r\nmembership of the United Nations to assess the work of\r\nthe Council. In that connection, the present report speaks\r\nfor itself in terms of the quantity of work covered during\r\nthat period. The President of the Security Council, in his\r\nintroduction this morning, informed us of the progress\r\nmade so far in improving the content and value of the\r\nreport, as well as the further steps that need to be taken\r\nto ensure that the reporting procedures of the Council\r\nmeet the aspirations of all the Members of the United\r\nNations, as expressed in General Assembly resolution\r\n51/193 of 1996.\r\nOur contribution to this debate on the report and,\r\ntherefore, on enhancing the transparency of the Council’s\r\nworking methods will be limited to observing a number\r\nof specific issues. We believe that the results of the\r\ninformal working group, when fully implemented, will be\r\na first step towards making the current procedures more\r\ntransparent and informative. The reports will also have, as\r\nan addendum, monthly assessments by Presidents of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe decision to include the monthly assessments as\r\nan addendum to the Council’s report is a very useful\r\nundertaking which began in June this year. My delegation\r\nbelieves that an analytical addition to the report will\r\nprovide critical insights into the issues, thereby enabling\r\na better reading of the situations in question, as well as\r\nthe actions that need to be taken. We strongly believe that\r\nthese assessments will enable other Member States to gain\r\naccess to current thinking and trends within the Council.\r\nMy delegation agrees with the assessment of\r\nAmbassador Somavía that the briefing sessions of the\r\npresidency, open to all Members of the United Nations,\r\nare not always very well attended. In addition, inquiries\r\non the issues before the Council are constrained by the\r\ntradition of confidentiality that surrounds informal\r\nconsultations. Thus any reporting of what takes place in\r\ninformal Council meetings may not be very useful to\r\nMember States. We therefore agree with the view that we\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nshould be able to improve the usefulness and scope of these\r\nsessions by working together.\r\nThe issuing of statements to the press by the President\r\nof the Security Council is another area we would briefly\r\nlike to comment on. During Kenya’s presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council in February this year, we were made to\r\nunderstand that releasing the written statements to the press\r\nand Member States was equivalent to formalizing\r\ninformality. That is, since the consultations were informal,\r\nanything written thereafter, even if it had been read to the\r\npress and represented as an accepted position of all Council\r\nmembers, was not appropriate because it assumed a formal\r\nappearance. In contrast, we believe that if a statement has\r\nbeen read to the press, it should be appropriate to provide\r\nit to Members of the United Nations present at the briefing,\r\nto whom we should be more responsive.\r\nThe meetings of troop-contributing countries tend to\r\nbe formal and, indeed, sometimes pro forma, with\r\nindividual national problems having being resolved at the\r\nSecretariat level. There is a need to make them more\r\ndynamic, relevant, rewarding and effective for all\r\nconcerned. We are also aware that many other proposals on\r\nthe working procedures of the Council have been made at\r\nmeetings of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council, and we look forward\r\nto discussing them with other delegations.\r\nAllow me to discuss a disturbing trend we have\r\nobserved with respect to agenda items on Africa, which\r\ncurrently make up 65 per cent of the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. Ten months of Kenya’s two-year tenure in the\r\nSecurity Council have gone by. The logic and relative\r\npredictability that governed international relations during\r\nthe cold war have gone, leaving in their place an ensuing\r\nfree-for-all that has had far-reaching results for international\r\npeace and security. In Africa, for example, we have seen\r\ndemocratically elected Governments, as well as\r\ndictatorships, deposed by military means. We have\r\nwitnessed States invading other States with little or no\r\ncondemnation from the international community and, in\r\nfact, in some cases, we have observed tacit support for such\r\nillegality.\r\nIt has become clear that the manner in which the\r\ninternational community responds to events is extremely\r\nimportant to how such events develop. In the case of Sierra\r\nLeone, this coup was unanimously and unreservedly\r\ncondemned by the international community. Consequently,\r\nit is expected that in six months, the legal regime will be\r\nreinstated and the soldiers will return to barracks. In\r\ncontrast, however, in the case of the Congo (Brazzaville),\r\nthe international community’s condemnation of the\r\noverthrow of the democratically elected Government of\r\nPresident Lissouba was amazingly lukewarm. A few\r\nmonths ago, when the crisis was heating up, the\r\nSecretary-General called for the urgent deployment of a\r\npeacekeeping force in the Congo (Brazzaville). This call,\r\nwhich my delegation supported, was not heeded. General\r\nSassou-Nguesso is now in control in the Congo\r\n(Brazzaville). We ask ourselves what happened to those\r\nprinciples of respect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of nation States that we hold so dear and cherish\r\nso much? Have we discarded them? Or are we only going\r\nto apply them selectively? We feel this trend will\r\nundermine the moral authority with which this Assembly\r\nand the Security Council can speak against illegal\r\nregimes. Kenya believes that the international community\r\nshould carefully guard against this trend.\r\nFinally, Kenya will continue to participate actively\r\nin the Security Council’s working group on\r\ndocumentation and procedures, which we believe has\r\nenabled a healthy light of transparency to shine more in\r\nthe Council. It is a good thing in itself to prepare quality\r\nreports, but it is even more important to make the Council\r\nnot only more transparent, but more effective by making\r\nit a more proactive rather than a reactive body.\r\nMr. Duval (Canada): This debate on the report of\r\nthe Security Council for the period 16 June 1996 to 15\r\nJune 1997 is welcome both as an exercise in transparency\r\nand as a reminder that the Security Council belongs to the\r\nUnited Nations membership as a whole. We thank the\r\nPermanent Representative of Chile, Ambassador Juan\r\nSomavía, for having introduced the report to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWith respect to methods of work, my delegation\r\ngreatly appreciates the real effort made by individual\r\nCouncil members to enhance transparency in Security\r\nCouncil operations. The daily briefings are useful, and we\r\nacknowledge the attention that Council Presidents\r\naccorded to the practice during the period covered by the\r\nreport. The opening to non-members of the Council of\r\nmeetings which are essentially informative in nature,\r\nincluding certain briefings by the Secretary-General or\r\nother United Nations representatives and meetings now\r\nheld under the Arria formula, would be appreciated.\r\nMy delegation is encouraged by the efforts of some\r\nCouncil members to obtain access to additional sources of\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\ninformation, and we believe it to be entirely appropriate\r\nthat the Council should benefit from the expertise of\r\nrepresentatives of non-governmental organizations. But it\r\nwould be wrong for non-governmental organizations to\r\nhave better access to the Council than do Member States.\r\nThis incongruity is exemplified by the experience of my\r\ndelegation. Having assumed a mandate from the Security\r\nCouncil to lead a multinational force in eastern Zaire,\r\nCanada found itself excluded from the Council’s discussion\r\nof that crisis with representatives of non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nCanada supports other mechanisms, such as the groups\r\nof friends of the Secretary-General which, especially in the\r\ncase of Haiti, have allowed countries with a particular\r\ninterest in a Security Council matter a measure of influence\r\non the Council’s deliberations. We would, however, also\r\nwelcome efforts which would allow Member States that are\r\ndirectly affected by Council action to be able to state their\r\nviews directly to the entire Council before decisions are\r\ntaken in closed consultations. This includes major troop\r\ncontributors, who should have input into decisions that\r\nmight affect the very lives of their nationals. Greater\r\nparticipation by non-members in these areas would, we\r\nbelieve, only strengthen the Council’s credibility and\r\neffectiveness.\r\nWe heard with interest the statement this morning by\r\nthe representative of Germany. We fully agree with him\r\nthat transparency depends on those Member States serving\r\non the Council. We do not believe that improvements in\r\ntransparency and methods of work need to wait until\r\nSecurity Council reform is fully implemented. Indeed,\r\ncontributing to this shared objective of achieving greater\r\ntransparency in the Council’s method of work has been a\r\nprincipal objective for Canada in putting forward our\r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil for the period 1999-2000.\r\nWith respect to the Council’s substantive agenda, the\r\nreport before us speaks of the Security Council’s attempt to\r\ngrapple with such difficult issues as demining in the context\r\nof peacekeeping operations, ensuring the security of United\r\nNations and other personnel, and the protection of refugees\r\nand displaced persons. We applaud the Council’s efforts.\r\nOur candidature for the non-permanent Council seat is\r\nguided by a desire to contribute substantially to the\r\nCouncil’s efforts to achieve progress on these and related\r\nissues, which would include the impact on regional security\r\nof traffic in small arms.\r\nAll Member States have a role in ensuring that the\r\nUnited Nations remains capable of fulfilling the peace and\r\nsecurity mandate that, along with the promotion of\r\neconomic and social development, is at the very core of\r\nits purpose.\r\nThe report before us bears witness to the decrease in\r\nthe amount of peacekeeping being done by the Security\r\nCouncil. Let us recall that, only two years ago, there were\r\n80,000 peacekeepers at the service of the United Nations\r\nworldwide. By June 1996, this number had declined to\r\n26,300. This number is now projected to decline further\r\nto 13,000 by the end of this year, and 3,000 of these will\r\nbe civilian police.\r\nWe are concerned that the unfortunate reality is that\r\nthe number of conflicts in the world has in no way\r\nabated. We do not believe that, in response, the answer is\r\nalways to deploy more peacekeepers. However, it is our\r\nfundamental belief that the United Nations must remain\r\nengaged in the business of peacekeeping. There has been\r\nan increased tendency for the Security Council to rely\r\ninstead on multinational “coalitions of the willing” to\r\ncarry out peacekeeping functions and mandates. While we\r\nacknowledge that in many situations such coalitions are\r\nthe only viable mechanism to resolve a crisis, we would\r\nurge the Council to remain a key player; the deployment\r\nof multinational forces does not for a moment mean that\r\nthe Council should wash its hands of the matter. As the\r\nworld’s expert on peacekeeping, it continues to have an\r\ninvaluable role to play.\r\nCanada welcomes the increased collaboration\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and subregional\r\nbodies that is evident in this report. Such bodies are\r\nbecoming effective instruments for the promotion of\r\nregional peace and security. For example, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and its\r\nCommittee of Five are to be commended for their success\r\nin security support for the ECOWAS peace plan in Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nCanada supports greater collaboration with the\r\nOrganization of African Unity in the development of its\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution. We look forward to continued cooperation\r\nwith regional and subregional organizations in capacity-\r\nbuilding for preventive diplomacy, so that crises can be\r\nresolved at an early stage and we can look forward to the\r\nday when peacekeeping is no longer required at all.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation greatly appreciates the\r\nSecurity Council’s ongoing efforts in carrying out its\r\nmandate. Our intention today is to offer constructive\r\nobservations, with the objective of assisting the Council in\r\nundertaking its obligations. The Council can continue to\r\nrely upon Canada’s cooperation.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): At the outset, I would like to thank Ambassador\r\nJuan Somavía of Chile for his careful introduction of the\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly.\r\nWe are all immersed in the discussion of structural\r\naspects of the United Nations, but this should not delay\r\nwork on the basis of the existing structures to improve the\r\ntransparency of its main organs. In other words, the\r\nlegitimate hopes for a more efficient and democratic\r\nOrganization as a result of reform cannot stand in the way\r\nof the urgent need to improve the institutions that we now\r\nhave.\r\nThis conclusion seems to us particularly applicable to\r\nthe work of the Security Council. I note that its report,\r\ncontained in document A/52/2, includes certain\r\nimprovements as compared to the report submitted in 1996.\r\nOne is the inclusion in appendix X of a list of meetings of\r\nthe Security Council and troop-contributing countries,\r\nchaired by the President of the Security Council.\r\nWe are also pleased to see that this report, where it\r\nrefers to the outcome of the working group on\r\ndocumentation and procedure, reproduces document\r\nS/1997/451, which enumerates the various elements the\r\nCouncil’s report should contain.\r\nWe consider the decision to include in future reports\r\nthe assessments of former Presidents of the Council to be\r\nan encouraging advance. We are especially grateful to those\r\ndelegations that have already circulated such assessments\r\nfor the months of their presidencies. Here, we refer, in\r\nparticular, to Sweden and the United Kingdom. Such\r\nassessments are an important, if limited and provisional,\r\nstep towards greater transparency, since they provide a\r\nwritten record of the statements of the President to the\r\npress with regard to certain items that are considered in\r\ninformal consultations. Those delegations that have\r\npromoted the practice of presidential assessments, such as\r\nChile, Costa Rica, and, in particular, Portugal, as well as\r\nSweden, Japan, Egypt, Angola, Kenya, among others,\r\ndeserve the gratitude of all Member States.\r\nWithout detracting from these advances, we also\r\nnote that this year’s Security Council report, unlike last\r\nyear’s, does not tell us the number of informal\r\nconsultations that were held, but simply indicates how\r\nmuch time was spent in such meetings. We believe that\r\nthe number of informal consultations held by the Security\r\nCouncil in the course of a year is not merely an irrelevant\r\nor superficial matter. On the contrary, it is information\r\nthat gives non-members an idea of the extent to which the\r\nwork of the Council has been conducted by means of\r\nprocedures for which there is no record whatsoever.\r\nFurthermore, when the report of the Security Council\r\nwas presented by the Secretariat, the fact that it includes\r\nmore information on the work done by the various\r\nsanctions committees was emphasized. This is a good\r\nthing. However, we do not see progress on the amount\r\nand substance of the information provided. Since such\r\nreports partly concern commercial activities, greater\r\ntransparency would help avoid problems and unfortunate\r\nattempts to violate sanctions, attempts which sometimes\r\noccur precisely because of a lack of information.\r\nThe practice followed by successive presidencies of\r\nthe Council of briefing those delegations that are not\r\nmembers is by now well established, and is properly\r\nappreciated by most Member States. We regret the fact\r\nthat at those briefings Member States are not given more\r\ninformation than that which appears in the press. A recent\r\nassessment by a former President of the Security Council\r\npoints out that while contacts between the President and\r\nthe press take place on a daily basis, contacts with\r\ncountries that are not members of the Council are\r\nconfined to the days when informal consultations are held.\r\nThis analysis is obviously not very encouraging to\r\nMember States of the United Nations, and to some extent\r\nit explains why such briefings are so poorly attended.\r\nThe importance of keeping the media informed on\r\nwhat takes place in the Security Council is indisputable.\r\nBut at the same time it is hard to accept that our own\r\ncapitals should receive through the press information\r\nwhich by rights should be obtained at first hand and in\r\nthe Council Chamber itself.\r\nFurthermore, if public opinion and parliaments are\r\nkept at the margin of the most important aspect of the\r\nUnited Nations activity, peace and security, it will be\r\nincreasingly difficult for such crucial sectors to accept the\r\nusefulness of this Organization at a time of crisis and\r\nscant resources in national budgets.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nThe report of the Council should not be the only\r\nsource of information on the Council’s work. The\r\nRepertoire of the Practice of the Security Council used to\r\nbe one of the ways for Member States to become familiar\r\nwith the precedents followed by the Council in its\r\ninterpretations of the Charter and its own rules of\r\nprocedure.\r\nThe publication of this Repertoire is more than 10\r\nyears behind schedule, which creates difficulties for\r\ncountries that become members of the Security Council, for\r\nthe press and for parliamentarians, who cannot understand\r\nhow such a shortcoming can be tolerated by a principle\r\norgan of the United Nations. Its actual practice must\r\ntherefore be compiled objectively to ensure that all groups\r\nare familiar with it. We hope that the United Nations will\r\nquickly update that material, whose publication has suffered\r\nfrom budgetary restrictions that are difficult to reconcile\r\nwith the importance we attach to the Security Council.\r\nThere are many times when in the United Nations, and\r\nespecially in the Council, countries are urged to respect the\r\nprinciples that inspire democratic legitimacy. The last such\r\ncase was the case of Sierra Leone. Unfortunately, public\r\nopinion sees that the procedures followed by the Council do\r\nnot appear to be in keeping with such principles. The lack\r\nof transparency is clear when decisions are adopted in\r\nmeetings to which the other 170 Members of the United\r\nNations do not have access. But what is even more difficult\r\nto explain to public opinion is that in such informal\r\nconsultations high Secretariat officials render reports to\r\nwhich the other Members of the United Nations which\r\ncontribute to the funding of the Organization have no\r\naccess. This is a particularly harmful practice because it\r\nmakes more impenetrable the wall of isolation not only\r\nbetween the Security Council and the other Members of the\r\nOrganization, but also between them and important\r\nSecretariat officials.\r\nThis is not merely a concern of the delegation of\r\nArgentina. In 1994 the Foreign Minister of France, a\r\npermanent member of the Security Council and a day-to-\r\nday protagonist in world affairs, urged the Council to have\r\ngreater recourse to public debate in the adoption of its\r\ndecisions. Similarly, in 1992 a distinguished African\r\nAmbassador, representative of the largest regional group in\r\nthis Assembly, Mr. Mumbengegwi of Zimbabwe, stressed\r\nhow important it was for any decision adopted by the\r\nCouncil to stand up to the scrutiny of Member States.\r\nThe credibility of any organization is at stake\r\nwhenever it is seen as applying double standards.\r\nDemocracy is always essential, for our own domestic\r\npolitical systems as well as for the working procedures of\r\nthe Security Council. For this reason, apart from some of\r\nthe positive measures to which we referred earlier,\r\ntransparency will be achieved, first, when the reports of\r\nthe Secretariat are given in the presence of representatives\r\nof sovereign countries, and, secondly, when open\r\nmeetings of the Council become routine — all this\r\nwithout undermining the consultation process, which is\r\ninherent to diplomacy and presumes a certain amount of\r\nconfidentiality.\r\nHere, I would like to stress that when it comes to\r\ntransparency and voting methods, Argentina has had the\r\nprivilege of maintaining a close cooperation with the\r\ndelegation of New Zealand, which has indicated to me\r\nthat it associates itself with the points we are now\r\nmaking.\r\nFor Member States, which have to fund this\r\nOrganization, particularly in the context of the negotiation\r\nof a more burdensome scale of assessment, it should be\r\nunderstood that the reform process is a single entity. As\r\nregards the work of the Security Council, reform is\r\nnecessary, and Member States have been calling for it for\r\nyears. Those who, in an attempt to prevent war, designed\r\na multilateral system that would do away with secrecy\r\nand non-transparent procedures in international relations\r\nare today deemed to be the fathers of collective solidarity.\r\nWe urge those countries that have inherited the legacy of\r\ndemocracy and transparency to use their prestige and\r\ninfluence to make that legacy truly effective at a time\r\nwhen there is a wish to restructure the institutions of this\r\nOrganization, without new exclusions and for the equal\r\nbenefit of all 185 countries.\r\nMr. Sáenz Biolley (Costa Rica) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation is pleased to take part in this\r\ndebate on the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on its work from 16 June 1996 to 15\r\nJune 1997.\r\nDuring the second half of the period under\r\nconsideration, my delegation had the privilege of\r\noccupying one of the non-permanent seats reserved in the\r\nSecurity Council for the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States. Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy\r\nrepresentative of its Group in that most important organ\r\nand to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy:\r\nthe promotion of human rights, respect for international\r\nhumanitarian law, respect for the principle of non-\r\nintervention, total compliance with the prohibition of the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nuse of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal\r\nmeans of implementing the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination. Certainly, this was no easy task.\r\nThe Security Council deals with the most serious and\r\nsensitive situations that affect international relations and can\r\nthreaten international peace and security. However, thanks\r\nto active cooperation between its members, it has proved\r\npossible to uphold these fundamental values in the spirit\r\nand in the practice of that important United Nations organ.\r\nCosta Rica remains fully committed to continue promoting\r\nthese values in its future work within the Security Council.\r\nHowever, I cannot fail to mention the issue of\r\ntransparency in the procedures of the Security Council and\r\nthe format of its report. On transparency in procedures, I\r\nshould note that there are three concerns that must be\r\nrespected and considered.\r\n‘ First, there is the perfectly legitimate concern of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations that the activities of the\r\nSecurity Council be transparent. That concern arises from\r\nthe fact that, under Article 24, paragraph 1, of the Charter,\r\nthe Security Council is acting on behalf of the membership\r\nof the United Nations when it exercises its primary function\r\nof maintaining international peace and security.\r\nAccordingly, the activities of the Security Council must not\r\nand cannot be kept secret from the Members of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nSecondly, as the membership of the Organization and\r\nthe Security Council want its activities to be effective, on\r\nsome occasions confidentiality and privacy are certainly\r\nrequired when the Council takes its decisions. Although this\r\nis a controversial point, to my delegation it is a valid one.\r\nThirdly, the Security Council needs to get the\r\nmaximum amount of information possible from Member\r\nStates. This, along with the basic criterion of due process,\r\nexplains the existence of Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter,\r\nwhich allow Member States of the Organization that are not\r\nmembers of the Security Council to participate, without\r\nvote, in the Council’s discussions. Accordingly, my\r\ndelegation, together with other non-permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council, has frequently supported the holding\r\nof more public debates.\r\nThe concern for greater transparency will only be fully\r\nmet when the Member States of the Organization can\r\nobserve all the work of the Security Council. In this\r\nconnection, it would be desirable — pursuant to Articles 31\r\nand 32 of the Charter, as well as rules 37 and 38 of the\r\nprovisional rules of procedure of the Council — if these\r\nStates could participate in all discussions and be informed\r\nof the agenda of meetings far enough in advance. Of\r\ncourse, this would include being supplied with the details\r\nof “other matters”. The Security Council would thus be\r\nkept better informed of the position and views of the\r\ninternational community that it represents.\r\nUnfortunately, the current practice of the Security\r\nCouncil greatly limits the holding of public meetings.\r\nThis trend must be reversed. There must be more public\r\nmeetings. In particular, reports of the Secretary-General\r\nor his representatives must be presented and discussed at\r\npublic meetings. In the view of Costa Rica, there is no\r\nreason for these discussions to take place during\r\n“informal consultations”. Moreover, it does not seem\r\nacceptable that the Secretary-General should regard\r\ncertain information as confidential and that the majority\r\nof members of the Organization should not have access it.\r\nIn this regard, it is desirable that all delegations should be\r\ninformed of the written reports of the Secretary-General.\r\nMoreover, my delegation believes that the holding of\r\nmore public meetings would, to a large extent, resolve the\r\ndifficulties over the format of the Council’s report,\r\nbecause we would have full records of most of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\nOn the other hand, my delegation cannot deny that\r\nthe informal consultations of the Security Council play a\r\nvery important role in those situations in which the\r\nsensitive nature of the issues requires private, confidential\r\ndiscussions, or in which the decision-making process is\r\ngreatly facilitated by less formal discussions. For these\r\nreasons, my delegation is not at present in favour of\r\neliminating such meetings or having records of them or\r\ndetailed information about the discussions. However, we\r\nbelieve that such meetings should be the exception and no\r\nlonger be the rule.\r\nMy delegation cannot fail to voice its pleasure\r\nregarding the Security Council’s decision, reflected in the\r\nnote of the President of the Council of 12 June 1997, to\r\nchange the format of its report and to include assessments\r\nprepared by Presidents of the Council, under their own\r\nresponsibility, of the work of the Council during the\r\nperiod in which they held the presidency. We trust that\r\nthe positive effect of these changes will be seen in the\r\nreport of the Council for the current period. However, we\r\nrecognize that these decisions are just the first step\r\ntowards greater transparency and effectiveness in the\r\nwork of this most important body. Continued, united\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nefforts are required to ensure that the Security Council can\r\npresent clear reports to those whom it represents.\r\nLastly, on behalf of my delegation I would like to\r\nthank our friend, Ambassador Juan Somavía, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Chile, for his introduction of the report of\r\nthe Security Council, just as we thank him for his very able\r\nconduct of the discussions in the Council this month.\r\nMrs. Ospina (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I would like to begin by thanking the President of\r\nthe Security Council for his introduction of the report for\r\nthe period from 16 June 1996 to 15 June 1997, contained\r\nin document A/52/2.\r\nMy country welcomes the efforts made in the Security\r\nCouncil to introduce improvements into its reports.\r\nWe note with interest the agreement reached in the\r\nCouncil to the effect that in the future its annual reports\r\nwill be modified, taking into account the views that have\r\nbeen expressed regarding the current format, as can be seen\r\nin chapter 28 B of the report and in paragraph 2 of the note\r\nof the President of the Council, document S/1997/451 of 12\r\nJune 1997. That note also contains important details about\r\nthe content of the report in its new format; it will contain\r\ninformation regarding the work of subsidiary organs,\r\nincluding the sanctions committees, as well as information\r\nregarding the documentation and working methods and\r\nprocedures of the Council.\r\nSpecial mention should be made of paragraph 5 of the\r\nnote, which says that there will also be attached, as an\r\naddendum to the report, brief assessments of the work of\r\nthe Council, which representatives who have completed\r\ntheir functions as President of the Security Council may\r\nwish to prepare, following consultations with members of\r\nthe Council, for the month during which they presided. It\r\nis regrettable that, in accordance with the agreement\r\nreached in the Council, these addenda would be the\r\nexclusive responsibility of the outgoing Presidents and\r\nwould not represent the views of the Council. We await\r\nwith keen interest the addendum to the report containing the\r\nPresidents’ assessments referred to in paragraph 5. While\r\nacknowledging that this is a positive development, we stress\r\nthe need for the Council to pay due attention to all the\r\naspects mentioned in General Assembly resolution 51/193,\r\nespecially those contained in operative paragraph 4.\r\nWe would like to encourage the Council to continue\r\nto improve its reporting system. We also hope that\r\nwhenever necessary the Council will submit special reports,\r\nas mentioned in Article 24, paragraph 3, of the United\r\nNations Charter and in operative paragraph 5 of resolution\r\n51/193.\r\nThe submission of a more substantive report would\r\nfacilitate its consideration by the Assembly, as\r\nrecommended by the Open-ended High-level Working\r\nGroup on the Strengthening of the United Nations\r\nSystem.\r\nOn the basis of this evaluation, informal\r\nconsultations will have to be held, following the debate in\r\nplenary, to consider the need for and content of the\r\nmeasures which the Assembly will have adopted on the\r\nbasis of the discussion.\r\nAs recommended by the Working Group on the\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations System, the\r\nconsideration of the matter should not be deemed\r\nconcluded. It should remain open so that, if necessary,\r\nnew discussions can take place in the course of the year,\r\ntaking into account, inter alia, the submission of new\r\nreports.\r\nMr. Vasilyev (Belarus) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): The Republic of Belarus attaches great\r\nimportance to the work of the Security Council as the\r\nprincipal organ of the United Nations responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Our\r\ndelegation has listened carefully to the statements made\r\nby preceding speakers, which, we feel, contained\r\ninteresting and constructive proposals on how to improve\r\nthe work of the Security Council. We agree with most of\r\nthese suggestions. I will therefore limit myself to making\r\na few brief comments on the preparation and\r\nconsideration of the reports of the Security Council.\r\nWe note the positive changes that have occurred in\r\nthe preparation of the Security Council’s report, which\r\nshould lead to further improvements in the substantive\r\npart by enhancing its analytical nature. We also believe\r\nthat it would be positive to attach an addendum to the\r\nreport of the Security Council. This would contain brief\r\nassessments of the Council’s work by those\r\nrepresentatives who have completed their terms in the\r\npresidency. Although these assessments would reflect the\r\npersonal views of those representatives, this useful start\r\nwould be a step towards making the Council’s report\r\nmore analytical.\r\nWe believe that the Security Council’s report could\r\nbe improved by a more thorough preliminary\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nconsideration of its draft reports at open meetings and an\r\nanalytical description of the most important decisions of the\r\nCouncil, of why these decisions were taken and of the\r\ndifficulties encountered in the decision-making process. It\r\nwould also help to implement a procedure whereby the\r\nCouncil’s report would be introduced by the President or a\r\nrepresentative of one of its permanent members on the basis\r\nof rotation from one General Assembly session to another.\r\nWe believe that this would enhance concrete interaction\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Council and\r\nincrease the involvement not only of the Secretariat, but\r\nalso of Council members, in the process of preparing the\r\nreports. Following the discussion of a given item, it would\r\nbe helpful if the President of the Council, or a\r\nrepresentative of one of the permanent members on a\r\nrotating basis, were to make a final statement giving some\r\npreliminary reaction to the proposals and recommendations\r\nmade.\r\nI would express the hope that the comments made\r\nhere will be taken into account in the preparation and\r\ndiscussion of the Security Council’s reports in the future\r\nand that they will contribute in general to improving its\r\nwork.\r\nMr. Takht-Ravanchi (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nPermit me to associate myself with representatives who\r\nhave spoken before me in expressing appreciation to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador Somavía,\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Chile, for presenting the\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation welcomes this opportunity to express its\r\nviews on the work of the Security Council during the\r\nperiod covered by the report — 16 June 1996 to 15 June\r\n1997. They can be divided into two parts: those relating to\r\nthe substance and nature of the Council’s work and\r\ndecisions, and those relating to its working and reporting\r\nmethods and decision-making process.\r\nMy delegation recognizes that some progress has been\r\nachieved in the latter to render it more transparent and\r\ndemocratic and more in tune with the fiduciary character of\r\nSecurity Council. As many speakers before me have\r\npointed out, more needs to be done — a subject to which\r\nI will return.\r\nIn our view, the decisions of the Security Council in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security — the\r\nsubject of Part I of the present report — will gain further\r\nlegitimacy, authority and credibility if they are fully\r\nsupported by the general membership and seen by the\r\nconflicting parties as such.\r\nIn the current circumstances, when Members of the\r\nOrganization can provide valuable input to the Council\r\nwithout the old constraints of the bipolar world of the\r\ncold-war era, the Security Council should be able to take\r\nadvantage of the weight of the General Assembly to\r\nrequest recommendations, in accordance with Article 12\r\nof the Charter, with regard to the dispute or situation with\r\nwhich the Council is seized. Along the same chain of\r\nthought, attempts should be made to see how Articles 10\r\nand 11 could be interpreted alternatively in the light of\r\ncurrent realities to give effect to the role of the General\r\nAssembly in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has maintained that\r\nresort to Chapter VII should always be made with\r\nextreme caution. As the main body responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\r\nSecurity Council should enhance its contacts in a\r\nsustained manner with conflicting parties through every\r\npossible means. The perception of a Security Council that\r\nenergetically seeks peaceful solutions through diplomacy\r\nis by far stronger and more efficient than that which\r\nviews the Security Council as a heavy-handed body that\r\nreadily seeks coercive and interventionist measures to an\r\ninternational problem because it lacks vision, patience,\r\nevenhandedness or all of these.\r\nIn cases of any foreign military involvement by a\r\nState or a group of States in another State that has been\r\noriginated to implement a Security Council resolution\r\nadopted under Chapter VII, the Council must continue to\r\nbe actively engaged and must assume full responsibility\r\nfor the manner in which its decisions are implemented.\r\nThe Security Council must avoid the newly preferred\r\napproach of delegating authority to structures outside of\r\nthe United Nations for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Such an approach, when used\r\nrepeatedly, will erode the authority and credibility of the\r\nCouncil and of the Organization as a whole.\r\nGoing back to the working and reporting methods of\r\nthe Council, I must say that the current report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly falls short of what is expected of the\r\nCouncil in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter. The\r\nreport clearly fails to deliver what it promises in the\r\nintroduction: to be a guide to the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil. How are the non-members of the Council to be\r\nguided by the report when it offers no analysis of the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\ndecisions of the Council, nor of its problems and successes,\r\nnor of the lessons learned from its past activities. The\r\nreport is a compilation of published documents, which is\r\nlargely useful for those interested in an historical study of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nMany speakers before me have pointed out the\r\nshortcomings of the report, and we fully agree with them.\r\nLet me draw attention to one more that may be non-\r\nconventional. Part III of the report, which relates to the\r\nwork of the Military Staff Committee, consists of only three\r\nfull lines. In light of the need for transparency and effective\r\ncommunication between the Council and the General\r\nAssembly, I am not sure that the provision of some broad\r\ninformation on the topics of the 26 meetings the Military\r\nStaff Committee held would have undermined the integrity\r\nof the Committee’s work.\r\nIn our view, the Security Council would enhance its\r\ncredibility were it to be responsive and forthcoming to the\r\nviews expressed by the general membership in terms of\r\nadopting further measures for the democratization and\r\ntransparency of its working methods and communication\r\nwith the General Assembly. The report of the Council\r\nneeds to be improved to become more analytical, with\r\nassessment of past activities, particularly those relating to\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nThe report also needs to contain information on\r\ninformal consultations of the whole, where most important\r\ndecisions are made. One way to do that is to annex an\r\naccount of the welcome practice of briefing by the\r\npresidency of the Council for the non-members of the\r\nSecurity Council. Such an addition to the report would also\r\nserve as an inducement to accord some structure and more\r\nsubstance to the briefings. The same approach could be\r\nadopted for the briefings by the Chairmen of the subsidiary\r\ncommittees of the Security Council.\r\nConsideration should also be given to the possibility\r\nof members of the Security Council holding regular\r\nbriefings for members of their respective geographical\r\ngroups.\r\nThe General Assembly should develop, in appropriate\r\nworking groups and in the light of contemporary realities,\r\na guideline to be recommended to the Security Council on\r\nthe number of reports it should receive and on the meaning\r\nof “when necessary” in terms of special reports in the\r\ncontext of Article 24.\r\nDemocratization, transparency, fairness and, above\r\nall, practical considerations in the working methods of the\r\nCouncil require a broader application of Article 31 of the\r\nCharter to allow the participation of a State which is not\r\na member of the Security Council in its informal\r\nconsultations, when it is considering an issue that directly\r\naffects the interest of that State.\r\nThe same ideals will require that more meetings of\r\nthe Council be held in an official format. Meetings that\r\nhave an informative character, such as briefings by the\r\nSecretary-General or other United Nations representatives,\r\nare a good start.\r\nThe Security Council functions on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations, and as such it\r\nneeds the full support of the General Assembly to\r\neffectively fulfil its mandate. The General Assembly\r\nlooks forward, as manifested in the current consideration\r\nof the Council’s report, to a healthy dialogue and\r\nrelations, as well as an effective and sustained means of\r\ncommunication with the Council. The Security Council\r\nshould too.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of the report (A/52/2) of the Security Council?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded this stage\r\nof our consideration of agenda item 11.\r\nAnnouncement by the President\r\nThe President: I should like to make an\r\nannouncement concerning the following activities.\r\nThe 1997 United Nations Pledging Conference for\r\nDevelopment Activities will be held on Tuesday and\r\nWednesday, 4 and 5 November, in the morning of both\r\ndays.\r\nThe announcement of voluntary contributions to the\r\n1998 programme of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees will take place on Friday,\r\n7 November, in the morning.\r\nThe Special International Meeting in Support of the\r\nUnited Nations Inter-Agency Programme of International\r\nAssistance to Areas Affected by the Chernobyl Disaster\r\nwill be held on Tuesday, 25 November, in the morning.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 29 October 1997\r\nThe announcement of voluntary contributions to the\r\n1998 programmes of the United Nations Relief and\r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\r\nwill take place on Tuesday, 2 December, in the morning.\r\nMembers are requested to consult the Journal\r\nannouncements for these activities for further details.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.50 p.m.\r\n16\r\n"
