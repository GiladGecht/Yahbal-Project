The names\r\nof these 36 States should therefore not appear on the\r\nballots.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly\r\nresolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking\r\ninto account the number of States which will remain\r\nmembers of the Council after 1 January 1998, the 18\r\nmembers should be elected as follows: five from African\r\nStates, four from Asian States, two from Eastern\r\nEuropean States, three from Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States and four from Western European and\r\nother States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the\r\nnumber of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats\r\nto be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a\r\ntwo-thirds majority of those present and voting will be\r\ndeclared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining\r\nseat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those\r\ncandidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthis procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret\r\nballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed by the\r\nChairmen of the regional groups that, for the five vacant\r\nseats from among the African States, the five endorsed\r\ncandidates are Algeria, the Comoros, Lesotho, Mauritius\r\nand Sierra Leone.\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 30 October 1997\r\nFor the four vacant seats from among the Asian States,\r\nthere are six candidates, namely, India, Malaysia, Oman,\r\nPakistan, Qatar and Viet Nam.\r\nFor the Eastern European States, there are three\r\ncandidates for two vacant seats: Belarus, Georgia, and\r\nPoland.\r\nFor the three vacant seats from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, there are five candidates:\r\nBrazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru and Saint Lucia.\r\nThe Group of Western European and other States has\r\nendorsed four candidates for four vacant seats: Belgium,\r\nItaly, New Zealand and the United States of America.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nwe shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will\r\nnow be distributed. I request representatives to use only\r\nthose ballot papers and to write on them the names of the\r\nStates for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will\r\nbe declared invalid.
