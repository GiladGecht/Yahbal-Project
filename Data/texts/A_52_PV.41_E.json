(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 15 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council\r\nThe President: This afternoon the General Assembly\r\nwill continue with the election of 18 members of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council to replace those members\r\nwhose term of office expires on 31 December 1997.\r\nAs members will recall, when the 40th plenary\r\nmeeting was adjourned earlier today there still remained to\r\nbe filled two seats from among the Asian States, one seat\r\nfrom among the Eastern European States and one seat from\r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States.\r\nI call on the representative of Georgia.\r\nMr. Volski (Georgia): I take this opportunity to\r\nextend the warmest words of gratitude to those delegations\r\nthat advocated Georgia’s membership of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and supported us to the very end. I would\r\nlike also to congratulate warmly all those already elected to\r\nthat important body, among them the delegation of Belarus\r\nfrom our regional group.\r\nUnder the circumstances, and in order to facilitate\r\nthe course of the election, the Georgian delegation has\r\ndecided to withdraw its candidature. Once again, let me\r\nthank those who supported us, and extend our best wishes\r\nfor success to the delegation of Poland.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of Qatar.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAs members know, Qatar is among the candidates for\r\nmembership of the Economic and Social Council. My\r\ncountry attaches great importance to occupying one of the\r\nseats allocated to the Asian States in order to represent\r\nour region. We recall that all countries large and small\r\nare eligible to stand for seats on the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, something we have seen with respect to the\r\nAfrican States and something which deserves the greatest\r\nrespect and recognition from my country and its regional\r\ngroup.\r\nIn view of our belief in the importance of\r\nrepresentation for the Asian group and in view of the fact\r\nthat Oman is among the candidates from that group, my\r\ndelegation has decided to withdraw its candidature in\r\nfavour of that of our sister State of Oman. I thank all\r\nthose delegations that have supported our candidature\r\nthroughout the process.\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 30 October 1997\r\nThe President: In accordance with the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall proceed now to a restricted ballot,\r\ntaking into account the statements made by the\r\nrepresentatives of Georgia and of Qatar.\r\nIn accordance with the rules of procedure, we shall\r\nproceed now to the third round of balloting, by secret\r\nballot, for the remaining seats.

Given the fact that there have been three ballots\r\nand in the light of our commitment to the Asian Group\r\nthat we would not stand in the way of a clean slate, we\r\nwish to facilitate the proceedings today by withdrawing\r\nour candidature.
