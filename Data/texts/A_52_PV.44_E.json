(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 49\r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution\r\nof Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of\r\nInternational Humanitarian Law Committed in the\r\nTerritory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nfourth annual report of the International Tribunal\r\n(A/52/375)\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly takes\r\nnote of the fourth annual report of the International\r\nTribunal?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Antonio Cassese,\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal.\r\nMr. Cassese (International Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations\r\nof International Humanitarian Law Committed in the\r\nTerritory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991): Mr.\r\nPresident, may I first of all express my deep gratitude for\r\nthe honour you have shown me by allowing me once again\r\nto address the General Assembly on the activities of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\r\nIn view of the fact that the first four-year mandate\r\nof the Hague Judges is drawing to a close, instead of\r\noutlining our activities from 1996 to 1997, I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to offer the Assembly an insider’s\r\nappraisal of our successes and shortcomings since our\r\nestablishment in 1993. The end of our first mandate also\r\ncoincides with the end of my second and last term as\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal. I would therefore\r\nlike to take this opportunity to express my thoughts,\r\nconcerns and hopes for the future of this extraordinary\r\ninstitution.\r\nTo make a dispassionate assessment of our first four\r\nyears of life, we need to take a step back and remind\r\nourselves of why the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nthe Former Yugoslavia was established in May 1993 and\r\nwhat we were mandated to achieve. This means looking\r\nat the vision behind the creation of the Tribunal and the\r\nmeans by which such a vision was to be realized.\r\nIn the context of a brutal conflict with violence and\r\natrocities on a scale not seen in Europe since the 1940s,\r\nthe Security Council clearly had one overriding aim, and\r\nthis was to contribute to peace in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nOne of the most significant responses of the United\r\nNations to the war was the establishment of an\r\ninternational judicial mechanism, through which the world\r\ncommunity could, first, contribute to peace by dispensing\r\njustice to the victims of genocide, murder, torture, rape\r\nand other atrocities in the former Yugoslavia; secondly,\r\ndeter further abuses of humanitarian law by making it\r\nclear that today’s world will no longer accept impunity\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nfor the planners and the perpetrators of these crimes; and\r\nthirdly, create a historical record of what occurred during\r\nthe conflict, thereby preventing historical revisionism which\r\nwould bury the memory of the victims alongside their\r\ncorpses.\r\nIf we contrast the aims pursued by the Security\r\nCouncil in 1993 with what has been achieved, the picture\r\nwe find is reasonably satisfactory.\r\nWith respect to the first goal of the Security Council,\r\nnamely the achievement of peace, it is well known that in\r\nspite of the Dayton/Paris Agreement, there is today only a\r\nfragile peace in the former Yugoslavia. The establishment\r\nof the International Tribunal was conceived as an important\r\ncontributing factor to the process of reconciliation and\r\npeace-building. Today nobody would deny that the Hague\r\nTribunal is a fundamental piece of a highly complicated\r\njigsaw puzzle. Today everybody is convinced, both in the\r\ncountries of the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere, that\r\nthere will be no real peace without justice. At The Hague,\r\nwe strive to dispense justice and have made significant\r\nprogress. Yet, despite what has been achieved in the last\r\nfour years, it would be entirely premature, inappropriate\r\nand even risky for us to speak at this stage of having done\r\njustice to the victims of violence in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe enormity of what we are dealing with is, of course, not\r\natoned for simply by holding a few trials; we have much,\r\nmuch more to do before history can fairly assess whether\r\nwe have adequately rendered justice at The Hague.\r\nThe second goal of the Security Council was that, by\r\nthe application of the rule of law, the International Criminal\r\nTribunal would deter further hostilities. There, one striking\r\nfailure stands out: the shameful slaughter on a massive\r\nscale of civilians following the fall of Srebrenica in July\r\n1995. True, these crimes have been thereafter the subject\r\nmatter of the first sentencing judgement of our Tribunal and\r\nvarious other proceedings resulting in the issuance of\r\ninternational arrest warrants.\r\nHowever, although in July 1995 the Tribunal was\r\nalready functioning as a judicial institution, the murderers,\r\ntorturers and rapists of Srebrenica had no fear of being\r\nmade accountable to the Tribunal. We then seemed to be an\r\nirrelevant, distant and ineffective body. The lesson here is\r\none I have been stressing in my reports to the Security\r\nCouncil and General Assembly since 1993, namely, that\r\nStates must cooperate with the Tribunal. Arrests must be\r\nmade. Assistance must be given to requests from the\r\nTribunal. People must know that genocide, mass rape and\r\nother egregious abuses are regarded as the pinnacle of\r\nhuman criminality, and that their own States will arrest\r\nthem if they are indicted by the International Criminal\r\nTribunal. Our potential to break the cycle of violence is\r\ngreat, but we can only do so with the assistance of States\r\nand the organized world community.\r\nWith respect to the Security Council’s third goal,\r\nnamely, to establish the truth of what happened, much has\r\nbeen achieved. In the course of prosecutions, much has\r\ncome into the public domain. The allegations of hideous\r\natrocities which whispered their way around the world\r\nthrough refugees, victims, humanitarian workers and\r\njournalists, have passed from accusation and rumour to\r\njudicial evidence.\r\nFor instance, the Tadić judgment, rendered by Trial\r\nChamber II of our Tribunal on 7 May 1997, established\r\nas a matter of judicial fact what happened in a particular\r\nplace in the former Yugoslavia, the opština or\r\nmunicipality of Prijedor, in the dark days of 1992. It has\r\nbeen proved to the satisfaction of the judges of that\r\nparticular Trial Chamber that certain things occurred in a\r\nparticular context. That judgment was the first ever\r\njudicial condemnation of “ethnic cleansing”. Memories\r\nfade and become prone to manipulation, buildings\r\ncrumble, people pass on, but our records and the reams of\r\nevidence collated by the Prosecutor of our Tribunal and\r\nscrutinized by the trial judges will impede revisionists\r\nfrom denying what happened in the opština of Prijedor\r\nand elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nLet me now set out briefly and concretely what we\r\nhave done in the four years that have passed. We can say\r\nwith honesty that within the means made available to us,\r\nwe have achieved considerable success. Beginning from\r\nnothing, hundreds of dedicated individuals have worked\r\nto create a fully functioning International Criminal\r\nTribunal. When we judges took office on 17 November\r\n1993, the Tribunal had no premises of its own, no staff,\r\nno budget, much less a courtroom.\r\nToday, although we have been endowed with only\r\nthe minimum necessary logistics, the Tribunal at The\r\nHague is a vibrant, fully operational judicial body.\r\nEighteen public indictments against 77 indictees, plus a\r\nnumber of sealed indictments have been issued by the\r\nProsecutor and confirmed by our judges. Twenty indicted\r\nindividuals, including some leaders, are currently in\r\ndetention at the United Nations prison at The Hague. One\r\nvery lengthy trial has been held, plus many other\r\nproceedings, and two other trials are under way, with a\r\nthird to commence within a matter of weeks.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nIn order to reach this stage, we had to overcome a\r\nseries of hurdles. Here again, I shall be candid. In 1993,\r\nneither the Security Council nor the General Assembly nor\r\nwe judges at the Tribunal in The Hague could imagine how\r\nmany obstacles we would face in our path: financial,\r\nlogistical, legal and, what is more, practical.\r\nThe financial and logistical aspects are plain. To\r\nestablish a functioning international criminal tribunal from\r\nscratch requires enormous funding. One has to hire staff\r\nfrom all around the world, recruit investigators and analysts\r\nto delineate the areas of investigation, set up a data bank,\r\nsend teams of investigators into the field, build courtrooms\r\nand offices and supply them with all the necessary\r\nequipment, build a prison, fund programmes for the\r\nprotection of victims and witnesses, and so on.\r\nLegally, it bears pointing out that, unlike national\r\njurisdictions which may rely on dozens of codes and\r\nhundreds of precedents for guidance, the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal must apply, in addition to its Statute,\r\ninternational customary law, which can only be ascertained\r\nby consulting widely dispersed international law sources on\r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. In addition, no\r\ninternational code of criminal procedure was available to us\r\nand we had to develop one ourselves: we call it Rules of\r\nProcedure and Evidence.\r\nIn practical terms, as is well known, it has proved\r\nextremely difficult to achieve significant State cooperation,\r\nin particular by ensuring that States comply with the\r\nTribunal’s orders to arrest and deliver indicted persons to\r\nour Hague Tribunal. While Croatia and the central\r\nauthorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina have complied, to\r\nvarious degrees, with such Tribunal orders, the two entities\r\ncomprising Bosnia and Herzegovina — Republika Srpska\r\nand the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina — have not\r\ndone so, nor has the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\n(Serbia and Montenegro), thereby flouting the authority of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThus, we face the same problems today that we have\r\nstruggled with over the last four years. Our first, most\r\ncrucial and most urgent problem is the need for more\r\narrests of military and political leaders.\r\nSecondly, the Office of the Prosecutor of our Tribunal\r\nshould be strengthened. More investigators are needed to\r\nundertake the many complex and time-consuming inquiries\r\nthat are necessary to fulfil the Tribunal’s mandate. In order\r\nto grasp the urgency of having more prosecutorial staff, one\r\nneeds only to look at what happens in some countries with\r\nregard to national crimes. For example, the Belgian\r\npaedophile investigation began in August 1996 with 350\r\npolice investigators, criminal analysts and forensic experts\r\nengaged on a full-time basis; after 12 months of\r\ninvestigations, 174 personnel remain engaged on the\r\ninvestigation, which is expected to continue until the end\r\nof 1998. Moreover, the Oklahoma City bombing case in\r\nthe United States had 120 investigators or FBI agents\r\nparticipating in the investigation at the bombing site in\r\nthe initial stages.\r\nBy contrast, at present the Office of the Prosecutor\r\nat The Hague has a total of 45 investigators and analysts\r\navailable, to collect evidence concerning hundreds of\r\ncomplex criminal activities perpetrated on a large scale in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia over more than four years of\r\narmed conflict.\r\nThirdly, while we have only one now available, we\r\nneed three or four courtrooms if we are to conduct\r\nnumerous trials with expedition and complete fairness.\r\nDespite the problems besetting our Tribunal at The\r\nHague and the limitations under which we labour, I\r\nbelieve that the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia is playing a momentous role in the\r\ncurrent international community. When our Tribunal first\r\nstarted working, it was as if we had constructed some\r\nnovel flying machine, with the international community\r\nwondering whether we would ever get it off the ground.\r\nThe Tribunal has, indeed, been able to take off, in spite\r\nof the adverse winds and the numerous storms which\r\nhave buffeted us.\r\nLet me also insist again on one important feature of\r\nthe Hague Tribunal. In 1993 the Security Council, with\r\nthe support of the General Assembly, set an important\r\nprecedent by creating, for the first time in world history,\r\na truly international and truly impartial criminal court. As\r\neveryone knows, the post-Second World War military\r\ntribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo have been haunted by\r\nthe charge that they were established by the victorious\r\nPowers to judge the vanquished. As a great writer once\r\nsaid, “The victor is the master even of truth; he can\r\nmanipulate truth as he pleases.” The International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is not open\r\nto this charge. Our Prosecutor has investigated and is still\r\nstriving to investigate all major crimes allegedly\r\nperpetrated in the former Yugoslavia, regardless of the\r\npolitical, ethnic or religious group to which the suspect\r\nbelonged. And we judges have pronounced upon\r\nindictments in an absolutely impartial manner, again\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nregardless of the political, national, ethnic or religious\r\naffiliations of the alleged culprits. For us, it is indeed\r\nobvious that it is the individual culpability or innocence of\r\nthe indictee that is all important.\r\nI shall add that, in addition to our actual functions, we\r\nhave also played what I would call a significant symbolic\r\nrole over the past four years. The Tribunal marks the\r\nadvent of real justice rather than mere appeasement. It has\r\nbeen said that the human rights doctrine ultimately boils\r\ndown to the right of victims to demand that their\r\npersecutors answer for their misdeeds. If this is so, the\r\nHague Tribunal can be seen as the very embodiment of the\r\nhuman rights doctrine. So far, more than 200 victims have\r\nappeared before the judges of the International Tribunal in\r\nThe Hague almost every day to give evidence of the\r\nhorrors which were visited upon them. What is even more\r\nimportant, they have told of the people who, they have\r\nalleged, committed those abuses.\r\nIn 1795 Immanuel Kant, in his famous essay on\r\nperpetual peace, wrote that the international community has\r\nprogressed so far that a violation of law and rights in one\r\nplace on Earth is felt in all other places. Our work at The\r\nHague is the embodiment of this faith in the international\r\ncommunity, and our efforts are founded on the notion of\r\nindividual accountability at the international level for\r\ninternational crimes that strike at the core of all of us. The\r\nhorrors of human depravity all over the world, if not dealt\r\nwith, diminish humanity’s notions of right and wrong, of\r\ngood and evil, and erode faith in mankind. In The Hague,\r\nwe do not subscribe to the view so aptly referred to by\r\nVictor Hugo that if a man is killed in Paris, it is murder;\r\nthe throats of 50,000 people are cut in the East, and this is\r\na problem. Atrocities, whether perpetrated in Europe,\r\nAmerica, Africa or Asia, must be punished. We at The\r\nHague very much hope that the international criminal court\r\nwill soon be established to cope with the most vicious and\r\ninhuman crimes, wherever they are perpetrated.\r\nIn concluding, let me turn to the future. We have spent\r\nthe last four years fighting to build up an international\r\njudicial institution worthy of the United Nations. We are\r\nnow moving to a totally different phase: in the next four\r\nyears, we will hold a number of important trials with the\r\nutmost expedition compatible with the principles of fairness\r\nand justice. Over the next four years, the Hague Tribunal\r\nwill continue to strive, with unshakeable resolve, to render\r\njustice in spite of the numerous problems which hamper our\r\neffectiveness. In view of these obstacles, which I have\r\ntouched upon in the course of this speech, I would like to\r\nurge all Member States to lend to the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia all the support the\r\nTribunal is entitled to receive.\r\nI say to Member States: You have launched a\r\nstupendous enterprise, the importance of which probably\r\nwill only be fully understood and appreciated in the next\r\nmillennium. You have put an end to the culture of\r\nimpunity, to the possibility of historical amnesia, and\r\nhave ruled out the immoral practice of passing laws\r\ngranting amnesty to all culprits. You have determined that\r\nvictims have a basic right to see their persecutors brought\r\nto justice. This is an enterprise to tame the savage heart\r\nof man and to make more gentle life on this planet, an\r\nenterprise worthy of a renewed United Nations and\r\nworthy of bearing fruit. I ask you to ensure that this\r\nextraordinary exercise in international morality and law is\r\nfully supported and yield lasting results. I beg you to\r\ncontinue to heed the cries of the victims of barbarity and\r\nallow this pioneering dispensation of international\r\ncriminal justice to become the hallmark of the new\r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Wolzfeld (Luxembourg) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. The countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope associated with the European Union — the Czech\r\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,\r\nRomania, Slovakia, Slovenia and the associated country\r\nof Cyprus — also support this statement.\r\nThe European Union would first like to thank the\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia, Mr. Antonio Cassese, for his introduction of\r\nhis fourth annual report. Both through its analysis and the\r\ndetails it provides, the report gives us a clear and\r\ncomplete picture of the activities of the Tribunal between\r\n1 August 1996 and 31 July 1997. We congratulate\r\nPresident Cassese and the Prosecutor and officers of the\r\nTribunal on the important work they have accomplished.\r\nThe European Union would also like to express its\r\nappreciation for the major contribution that the\r\nNetherlands, as host country, makes to the Tribunal’s\r\nactivities.\r\nIn its almost four years’ existence, the Tribunal has\r\nmade important progress. Under Security Council\r\nresolution 827 (1993), the international community\r\nestablished jurisdictional mechanisms to put an end to the\r\nsituation of impunity enjoyed by too many perpetrators of\r\nserious crimes, breaches of international law committed\r\nduring the years of conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The\r\nproper functioning of the Tribunal is crucial for the full\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nimplementation of the peace accords in the former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nThe European Union reaffirms that in order to do its\r\njob impartially the International Tribunal must be totally\r\nindependent of any political authorities. The European\r\nUnion will therefore refrain from commenting on cases now\r\nbefore the Tribunal. However, we would like to stress the\r\nneed for unstinting cooperation by all States and all parties\r\nwith the International Tribunal, to enable it to perform its\r\nduties satisfactorily.\r\nThe normalization of relations in the territory of the\r\nformer Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia requires\r\nthat a new atmosphere of confidence and security be\r\nestablished among the parties. The European Union believes\r\nthat confidence and security will only be possible if there\r\nis respect for the primacy of law. The legal obligation to\r\ncooperate with the Tribunal is mentioned in article 29 of its\r\nstatute. The handing over or transfer of indictees for whom\r\narrest warrants have been issued is essential in order to\r\nassure the Tribunal’s proper functioning and credibility. The\r\nEuropean Union believes that the international community\r\nmust see to it that article 29 of the statute is fully\r\nimplemented. Over and above legal considerations, it is the\r\nmoral responsibility of the international community to see\r\nto it that the perpetrators of atrocities do not go unpunished\r\nand that justice is not denied to the victims of such crimes.\r\nAs President Cassese mentioned in his report, the\r\nTribunal has made important progress with the resources\r\navailable to it. However, it continues to be obstructed by\r\ncertain States and entities of the former Yugoslavia that\r\nrefuse to cooperate. There the European Union fully shares\r\nthe views of Mr. Cassese. Whereas Croatia and the central\r\nauthorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina have complied, to\r\nvarying degrees, with the Tribunal’s orders, the two entities\r\nthat make up Bosnia and Herzegovina — the Republika\r\nSrpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has not, thus defying\r\nthe authority of the United Nations. The impunity enjoyed\r\nin the former Yugoslavia by a large number of indictees is\r\nunacceptable.\r\nNothing can justify the non-execution of arrest\r\nwarrants. It is essential that States adopt the necessary\r\nlegislative, administrative and judicial measures to ensure\r\nthe speedy execution of the orders issued by the Tribunal.\r\nAlthough many States have promulgated enforcement\r\nlegislation to discharge their responsibilities, the European\r\nUnion continues to be concerned that, generally speaking,\r\nthe situation is unsatisfactory.\r\nMoreover, the European Union reaffirms that it is\r\nimperative to give proper financial support and to ensure\r\neffective personnel management in the Tribunal. The\r\nEuropean Union welcomes the decision of the General\r\nAssembly to request the Secretary-General to submit in\r\nhis programme budget for 1998 recommendations to\r\nenable the International Tribunal to complete its job as\r\nsoon as possible. This budget is now being considered by\r\nthe Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions, and we hope that very soon it will be taken up\r\nby the Fifth Committee. The European Union encourages\r\nall States to help ensure that consideration of the\r\nTribunal’s budget is speedily concluded.\r\nThe European Union and its member States will\r\ncontinue to make voluntary contributions to help the\r\nTribunal’s work; it will provide full support for its\r\nsmooth functioning. To that end, a cooperative\r\nrelationship with the various republics is contingent upon\r\ntheir compliance with the peace accords and their\r\ncooperation with the International Tribunal.\r\nThe European Union believes that the International\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is an important\r\nprecedent for the establishment of an international\r\ncriminal court. The work and experience of the Tribunal\r\nwill provide a valuable source for the establishment of\r\nrules making it possible to prosecute and punish, at the\r\ninternational level, serious violations of humanitarian law,\r\nno matter where or by whom those crimes were\r\ncommitted.\r\nAlmost four years after its establishment, the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\nis a fully operational judicial body. On the whole, it has\r\nbeen an outstanding success, thanks to all those who have\r\ncommitted themselves to the cause of justice. The\r\nEuropean Union and its member States will continue to\r\ngive full support to the Tribunal, and request that other\r\nMember States do likewise. For peace to triumph, justice\r\nmust prevail.\r\nMr. Berteling (Netherlands): I would like to take\r\nthe floor on the agenda item before us today as the\r\nrepresentative of the host country of the International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia.\r\nThis Tribunal, as delegations will know, is seated in The\r\nHague, “the judicial capital of the world”, as the President\r\nof the International Court, Judge Schwebel, put it just the\r\nother day before this General Assembly.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nThe Netherlands, of course, fully subscribes to the\r\nintervention that has just been made on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union by the Ambassador of Luxembourg.\r\nWe have read the report of the Tribunal and listened\r\ncarefully to President Cassese’s lucid presentation. Despite\r\nthe enormity of its tasks and the political and financial\r\nconstraints on its operations, the Tribunal has now come of\r\nage. It is making its own distinctive mark on history. We\r\nexpress our gratitude to Judge Cassese for his leadership as\r\nPresident of the Tribunal during its first and most difficult\r\nperiod of existence. Through his tireless efforts the Tribunal\r\ndid “get off the ground”, as he put it himself.\r\nAt the same time, we are grateful to those officials of\r\nthe Tribunal whose terms of office expired during the\r\nreporting period, and we recognize the invaluable efforts of\r\nthe Registrar, the Prosecutor and their staff, illustrated by\r\ntheir tireless efforts during the reporting period. A word of\r\nspecial thanks is also due Mr. Richard Goldstone, who, by\r\nhis personal commitment and charisma, contributed greatly\r\nto the recognition of the fledgling Tribunal by the\r\ninternational community. Dispensing justice is indeed the\r\nwork of dedicated individuals.\r\nFinally, I wish to congratulate the Judges and the new\r\nProsecutor on their appointment, election or re-election to\r\ntheir respective terms of office. As indicated in the report,\r\nthese will be taxing years for all of them. We wish them\r\nthe wisdom and stamina required for these high offices and\r\npledge them all our support.\r\nThe Netherlands feels indeed privileged to host an\r\ninstitution that is growing up at such a fast pace and with\r\nsuch excellent credentials. In this respect, I beg to differ\r\nwith the view expressed in the report; contrary to the\r\nreport’s statement, the Tribunal’s operation is not a partial\r\nfailure. It is not the Tribunal, but the bringing to justice of\r\naccused war criminals that is still not functioning as it\r\nshould. We, the Member States, do not seem to allow the\r\nTribunal to come to full fruition and we, the Member\r\nStates, should mend our ways. International criminal\r\nadjudication, although a new concept for many States,\r\nentails responsibilities for all members of the international\r\ncommunity. We cannot simply establish international\r\ntribunals and then walk away from them. For these\r\nTribunals to serve as humanity’s defence against\r\ninhumanity, as civilization’s ultimate bastion against the\r\nultimate in uncivilized behaviour, as mankind’s ears to the\r\ncries of victims, we must be prepared to take upon\r\nourselves the tasks necessary for the functioning of such\r\nTribunals.\r\n“Humanity” and “civilization” are the key words in\r\ndescribing the Tribunal’s raison d’être. The judicial\r\nadministration is as much an instrument in restoring and\r\nsafeguarding humanity and civilization as are Blue or\r\nWhite Helmets and peace-building, preventive diplomacy\r\nand negotiations, ballot boxes and the rebuilding of local\r\ncommunities. The Tribunal’s purpose is certainly not\r\nrevenge or retribution. Its ultimate success will be\r\nmeasured by its ability to show that justice prevails and\r\ninhumanity does not go with impunity; that civilization\r\nwill be preserved; and that the international community\r\ndoes care.\r\nIf only for those reasons, the Tribunal is justified in\r\nasking Member States to put more of an effort into\r\narresting indicted war criminals and bringing them before\r\nthe Tribunal. First and foremost, this holds true for the\r\nleaders and communities directly involved in the peace\r\nprocess: the parties to the Peace Agreement. Peace should\r\nbe a comprehensive effort by all sides to preserve\r\nhumanity and civilization for future generations. Those in\r\npower must realize that their failure to recognize this not\r\nonly endangers present-day peace efforts, but also\r\njeopardizes the future of their children and their children’s\r\nchildren. Therefore, we urge all those involved, directly\r\nor indirectly, to live up to their obligations and cooperate\r\nin advancing the course of justice.\r\nWe also appeal to all Member States to seek ways\r\nand means in the realm of their domestic jurisdiction of\r\nassisting the Tribunal in every way possible. As indicated\r\nin the report, this can be done, for instance, by actively\r\ntracing and handing over indicted persons to the Tribunal,\r\nby instituting proceedings against alleged war criminals in\r\ntheir domestic courts, and by allowing war criminals\r\nconvicted by the Tribunal to be imprisoned within their\r\nborders.\r\nThe Netherlands recognizes the legal obstacles to be\r\nsurmounted in this respect. Nevertheless, we wish to\r\nremind all States of their obligations, political and legal,\r\nunder international law and of their duty to cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal under the terms of its Statute. We\r\ncommend the Tribunal for drawing up model\r\narrangements to this particular end and again urge\r\nMember States to seek early the conclusion and\r\nimplementation of such arrangements.\r\nAlthough peace-building cannot be achieved by the\r\napplication of criminal law alone, the Tribunal must be\r\nallowed to discharge its tasks expeditiously and to the\r\nfull. Ultimately, humanity and civilization thrive only\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nunder the protection of the rule of law. Ultimately, peace\r\nwithout justice cannot and will not persist. In order for the\r\npeace-building efforts in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia to succeed, Member States must be prepared to\r\nbear and share this responsibility politically and financially,\r\nboth in the international arena and domestically. Praise is\r\ndue to those Member States that already do so and we\r\nencourage others to do so as well.\r\nThe Netherlands Government takes the role of host\r\ncountry very seriously. The Tribunal can therefore count on\r\nour continuous support, financial and otherwise, structural\r\nand for incidental projects. As examples of the last\r\ncategory, I would like to mention that the Netherlands this\r\nyear, for instance, has financially contributed to the\r\nTribunal, at both the personnel and the logistical levels, for\r\non-site investigative travels with a view to the gathering\r\nand securing of evidence, by providing the necessary\r\nfunding for a new telephone exchange, updating the\r\nTribunal’s facilities of worldwide communication, and by\r\nassisting in the backlog of computerized filing of and\r\naccess to the Tribunal’s documentation. The total of these\r\nvoluntary commitments by the host country exceeded by far\r\nthe $1 million mark.\r\nAs for the present year, to be reported on next year,\r\nplans are presently being worked out for a substantial in-\r\nkind contribution of at least $1 million towards the\r\nconstruction of a second courtroom. The Netherlands\r\nGovernment decided to do so in order to help solve the\r\nstructural capacity problem the Tribunal is facing as a result\r\nof the arrival in The Hague of 10 Croat indictees early last\r\nmonth. This is a fortunate development in and of itself, but\r\nit is bound to put an extra strain on the logistical and staff\r\ncapacity of the Tribunal. A second main courtroom is\r\nindeed urgently needed and extra staff — and perhaps even\r\nextra Judges — will have to be appointed.\r\nFinally, the sharing of responsibilities takes effect not\r\nonly on the State level, but also through the United Nations\r\nwhich, after all, established the Tribunal. The Tribunal must\r\nbe authorized to meet the expenses it encounters in the\r\nperformance of its statutory functions. The Tribunal must\r\nbe allowed to function as a credible part of the total peace\r\neffort of the international community in this region of the\r\nworld. We urge Member States to continue to grant the\r\nnecessary financial leeway to the Tribunal to discharge its\r\nfunctions properly, both by allotting sufficient funds under\r\nthe Tribunal’s regular budget and, if need arises, by way of\r\nvoluntary contributions to the Trust Fund of the Tribunal\r\nover and above the budgeted funds.\r\nAs I stated before, it is upon the international\r\ncommunity, the States Members of the United Nations,\r\nthat the success of the Tribunal depends. If we forsake it,\r\nwe forsake humanity.\r\nThe President: I should like to propose that the list\r\nof speakers in the debate on this item be closed this\r\nmorning at 11.15 a.m.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): First of all, allow me to\r\ncongratulate the President of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Chief Justice\r\nCassese, on his statement. This time, his account of the\r\nTribunal’s activities carries a special meaning. It was, in\r\nfact, an exceptionally high-profile presentation of the\r\nwork of the Tribunal in its first four years of existence —\r\nan assessment of what has been achieved so far and of\r\nwhat still needs to be done in order to respond to the\r\never-increasing demand for international criminal justice.\r\nOn the eve of the end of Mr. Cassese’s mandate as\r\nPresident of the Tribunal, I should like to express to him\r\nItaly’s deepest gratitude for the skill and dedication he\r\nhas shown in performing his duties.\r\nOur colleague from Luxembourg, Ambassador Jean-\r\nLouis Wolzfeld, has already expressed the views of the\r\nEuropean Union on the report of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Needless to\r\nsay, we fully concur with these views. Italy would simply\r\nlike to add some complementary remarks, focused on the\r\nmain aspects of the Tribunal’s activities.\r\nAs rightly and eloquently pointed out by Chief\r\nJustice Cassese, the establishment of the Yugoslav\r\nTribunal was meant to achieve three fundamental goals:\r\ncontribute to peace by dispensing justice to the victims of\r\natrocities in the former Yugoslavia; deter and prevent\r\nfurther abuses of international humanitarian law; and\r\npreserve the historical memory of those atrocities. The\r\nTribunal has continued to make significant progress in\r\nfulfilling its tasks. While obstacles and problems of a\r\nvaried nature remain, we are confident that they can be\r\novercome. The road ahead is still long, but, in spite of the\r\ndifficulties, the Tribunal has demonstrated its ability to\r\nplay a tremendous role as a fully operational judicial\r\ninstitution for the prosecution and punishment of some of\r\nthe most serious crimes against mankind.\r\nSince last year’s report, a judgment has been\r\ndelivered, a judgment that represents a landmark in the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nhistory of international criminal law: the first judgment by\r\nthe Tribunal, and the first of its kind since the Nuremberg\r\nand Tokyo trials. Another accused, who pleaded guilty, has\r\nbeen sentenced. The procedure has been appealed and is to\r\nbe reheard. Other trials are already under way or are about\r\nto commence. Interlocutory and pre-trial hearings have been\r\nheld on numerous questions. The Appeals Chamber has\r\nrecently delivered an important judgment on the authority\r\nof the Tribunal to issue binding orders to States and\r\nGovernment officials. The office of the Prosecutor has\r\ncontinued to work tirelessly, and with excellent results, on\r\nits investigative and trial activities and the collection of\r\nevidence. The record is impressive, and we want to\r\ncommend all the members of the various organs of the\r\nTribunal for having made these achievements possible.\r\nMoreover, we note with satisfaction that a number of\r\naccused have been arrested and delivered to the Tribunal,\r\nor have surrendered to it. These are significant\r\ndevelopments in the right direction — the direction of\r\nempowering the Tribunal to exercise its functions on behalf\r\nof the international community.\r\nThis last remark brings me to the problems and\r\nshortcomings underlined by the report. Notwithstanding the\r\nefforts of the Tribunal and all its accomplishments, the vast\r\nmajority of indictees continue to be free. They seem to\r\nenjoy absolute impunity. The greatest obstacle remains the\r\nfailure by some States and entities in the former Yugoslavia\r\nto comply with their obligation to fully cooperate with the\r\nTribunal, in particular with the Tribunal’s orders to arrest\r\nand deliver indicted persons to The Hague. This obligation\r\nwas confirmed and reinforced by the 1995 Dayton\r\nAgreement. Italy is of the view that it must be met in the\r\nmost complete and effective way. Respect for State\r\nauthority cannot be adduced as a pretext for not cooperating\r\nwith the Tribunal.\r\nIn this same perspective, prompt enactment by the\r\nlargest number of States of legislation enabling them to\r\ncarry out their responsibility under the Tribunal’s statute is\r\nno less crucial. Furthermore, adequate funding needs to be\r\nprovided for the Tribunal’s activities if we want to ensure\r\nthat the basic conditions exist for the performance of its\r\nmandate. The office of the Prosecutor needs to be\r\nstrengthened, especially through the addition of more\r\ninvestigators. States’ cooperation in enforcing the sentences\r\nimposed by the Tribunal is equally important. Italy is proud\r\nto have been the first country, the first State to sign the first\r\nagreement, on 6 February 1997, for the enforcement of\r\nprison sentences pursuant to article 27 of the Tribunal’s\r\nstatute.\r\nBy creating the Yugoslav Tribunal, the international\r\ncommunity has taken a decisive step towards putting an\r\nend to the era of impunity and forgetfulness for the most\r\nheinous crimes of international concern. The action\r\nundertaken by this new judicial institution is also an\r\nessential element of the process of reconciliation and\r\npeace-building in the region. Italy has consistently\r\nsupported the activity of the Tribunal and will continue to\r\ndo so in order to ensure its complete success.\r\nMr. Boyd (Panama), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nSuch a commitment is made even stronger in the\r\nlight of the progress made by the project to establish a\r\npermanent international criminal court for the prosecution\r\nand punishment of serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law, wherever, whenever, and by whomever\r\ncommitted. Next June, we will host in Rome the\r\ndiplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the new\r\ncourt. The institutional framework to prevent impunity\r\nand dispense international criminal justice will then be\r\ncomplete. In this respect, the Yugoslav Tribunal is to be\r\nconsidered a fundamental laboratory — a pioneer — and\r\nits experience and achievements remain of utmost\r\nimportance for the establishment of the permanent\r\ninternational criminal court. I have little doubt that soon,\r\nin looking back at history, the Tribunal for the former\r\nYugoslavia will be seen as the cornerstone of a new era\r\nin international relations, where justice prevails and\r\natrocities are no longer tolerated.\r\nMr. Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina): First, I\r\nmust take this opportunity to express thanks and to\r\ncommend all associated with the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for their commitment\r\nand effort over the past year. As Judge Antonio Cassese\r\ncompletes his trend-setting term as President of the Court,\r\nhis contributions, courage and leadership will leave a\r\nmonumental impression on the future work of this\r\nTribunal as well as on the international criminal court,\r\nwhich is still in an embryonic state. Although we had\r\nhoped for more results, this was not for lack of either\r\neffort or vision on the part of Judge Cassese or the Court\r\nas a whole.\r\nHere, I would also like to most graciously thank the\r\nNetherlands for its financial and other contributions to the\r\nTribunal. We hope that others will follow its example and\r\nheed the call for material, political, legal and legislative\r\nsupport for the Tribunal.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nSecondly, I would personally like to congratulate the\r\nRepublic of Croatia as well as our Croat leadership in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina for the recent cooperation extended\r\nto the Tribunal. Although there is still the need to complete\r\nthis cooperation, the recent steps have been significant not\r\nonly for the Tribunal but also for reconciliation, peace and\r\nnormalcy in our country and in our region as a whole. This\r\nnow basically leaves only one party within Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and only one country — the Federal Republic\r\nof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) — that not only\r\nrejected cooperation with the Tribunal and its orders but\r\ncontinue to reject it.\r\nAnd this brings me to the third point. I would like to\r\nemphasize that here I do not speak here for the entire\r\nPresidency of my country. Indeed, it is unfortunate that\r\nwhile I speak before the General Assembly only of clear\r\ncompliance with our Constitution enshrined within the\r\nDayton-Paris peace accords as well as with the\r\nfundamentals of international law, one party empowered\r\nthrough the processes established by those same peace\r\naccords will seek to use its authority to reprimand me for\r\nmy words to the Assembly today. That is the sad state of\r\nBosnia when legitimacy gained through the signatures for\r\npeace is usurped and misused to undermine that very\r\nagreement and its most critical provisions.\r\nThis leads to the fourth point. Radovan Karadžić,\r\nRatko Mladić and the other indicted war criminals — and\r\nI might add here Arkan and others from the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia who remain to be indicted — were\r\ninitially the vile products of our region, including\r\nneighbouring countries. Had there been no peace accord\r\nsponsored by the most powerful global factors and had\r\nthere been no international war crimes Tribunal for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, they would have remained our creation\r\nand our problem. Ultimately, they would have been\r\nconfronted by us and brought before our own national\r\ncourts until they were defeated, had answered for their\r\ncrimes and were irreversibly discredited. However, thank\r\nGod, there is now a peace accord structured by the Security\r\nCouncil, in particular by its most responsible members, and\r\nthere is a Tribunal established by the United Nations —\r\nthat is by all here, by all of us. Therefore, Radovan\r\nKaradžić and the others who have been indicted and are\r\nstill free are no longer our creation but are in fact the\r\ncreation of all in this Hall.\r\nWhile on one occasion one group of the indicted has\r\nbeen confronted — and I would like to express our\r\nsatisfaction and our thanks to the United Kingdom for its\r\nefforts — the continued hesitancy of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole to confront and arrest the others\r\nwho have been indicted is giving them new real and\r\nperceived powers. Simply put, these monsters of our\r\nregion’s creation were on their way to being discredited\r\nand disempowered. However, the rationalizations and\r\nexcuses put to us as to why they are not being\r\nconfronted, as to why they are not being arrested, have\r\nrejuvenated those individuals by making them seem\r\ninvincible before the international community, the United\r\nNations and in particular the most powerful military force\r\ntoday, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\r\nThe excuses of the powerful not only undermine their\r\nown credibility and the peace agreement, but have in fact\r\ncreated a new monster. My country will be on the certain\r\ncourse to peace when those in my current position can\r\ncall for full compliance with something that should be so\r\nnon-controversial: our Constitution and international law.\r\nFinally, let us be honest: Radovan Karadžić, Ratko\r\nMladić and others like them will not turn themselves in.\r\nLet those responsible for peace stop the charade in calling\r\nfor these people to turn themselves in. They and those\r\nthat shield them only feel empowered and emboldened by\r\nsuch appeals. They are now the responsibility of the\r\ninternational community to deal with properly under the\r\npeace agreement and the Tribunal. The international laws\r\nthat have been established must be enforced by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nJudge Cassese and all others associated with the\r\nTribunal have done all they can. We, who sincerely\r\nimplement the peace accords, have done and will continue\r\nto do our part. Radovan Karadžić, those who shield him\r\nand those whom he shields will not do their part. It is\r\nclear what needs to be done, therefore, if we are to have\r\nlasting peace in Bosnia, stability in the region and a real\r\nfuture for the Tribunal, the proposed international\r\ncriminal court and the United Nations.\r\nFrankly, the representative of the Netherlands had it\r\nright. The Tribunal is not deficient. It is we — all present\r\nhere today — who owe our unconditional support to the\r\nTribunal, who are responsible for its current deficiencies\r\nand who will ultimately be responsible for its success.\r\nMy thanks once again go to Judge Cassese and the\r\nmany others who have done and will continue to do their\r\npart for justice, reconciliation and peace.\r\nMs. Giraldo (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I wish first of all to convey the thanks of my\r\ndelegation to Mr. Antonio Cassese, President of the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of\r\nPersons Responsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991, for his comprehensive\r\nreport.\r\nColombia was honoured by the election of one its\r\nmost renowned jurists to serve as a judge on the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\nfor the coming four years. Colombia is thus participating in\r\nthe international community’s effort to bring to justice those\r\nwho have committed serious crimes in that region.\r\nWe are, of course, aware of the criticism levelled at\r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia. But the fact is that in a mere four years, and\r\ndespite many obstacles in the way of its establishment and\r\nfunctioning, the Tribunal has become an institution that\r\ndeserves our appreciation and admiration. Recently, there\r\nhas been major progress: the first sentencing judgment has\r\nbeen handed down, and other cases are being heard.\r\nWe understand the great financial, logistical, legal and\r\npractical difficulties the Tribunal has had to face, including\r\nbeginning its work without facilities or staff, establishing\r\nthe relevant customary law, and securing cooperation from\r\nStates. We encourage the international community to\r\ncooperate more actively with the Tribunal so that it can\r\naccomplish its task of bringing to justice those who\r\ncommitted atrocities during the war in the former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nThe establishment of this genuinely international and\r\nimpartial Tribunal was an achievement of the international\r\ncommunity. The proper functioning of the machinery for\r\ndispensing justice in the region is therefore in the interest\r\nof the United Nations. In the light of incidents such as\r\nthose that took place in Srebrenica in the summer of 1995\r\nit is even more essential for the international community to\r\nmake a decisive contribution to enable this institution to\r\nfulfil its mandate.\r\nWe must not lose momentum or permit the buildup of\r\nresentments that could arise later. We must not forget those\r\nwho perished in that atrocious war. Their silent voices call\r\nout to us to make sure that these crimes do not go\r\nunpunished.\r\nMr. Danesh-Yazdi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I wish\r\nto begin by expressing the appreciation of my delegation to\r\nJudge Antonio Cassese, President of the International\r\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991, for presenting the fourth annual report of the\r\nTribunal, contained in document A/52/375. The 61-page\r\nreport before the General Assembly illustrates numerous\r\nactivities carried out by the Tribunal over a time span of\r\n12 months. The Members of the Organization that are\r\nanxiously looking forward to seeing all criminals involved\r\nin the Balkan conflict brought to justice attach great\r\nimportance to this report.\r\nFour years ago the United Nations made a historic\r\ndecision by establishing an ad hoc International Tribunal\r\nto bring to justice the perpetrators of the most heinous\r\ncrimes, including genocide, “ethnic cleansing”, massive\r\nrape of women, torture and forcible displacement of\r\ncivilians, which were all committed against Bosnian\r\nMuslims. This major step was taken with the\r\nwholehearted support of all members of the international\r\ncommunity in order to send a clear message to the\r\nvictims of such criminal acts, the dimensions and\r\nramifications of which go beyond any explanation, that\r\nhumanity will not turn its back on them and that the\r\ncriminals will not be given the opportunity to escape\r\napprehension and prosecution. Every member of the\r\ninternational community is convinced that there will be no\r\nreal peace in the Balkans without justice.\r\nIn the last four years the Tribunal has taken major\r\nsteps forward to achieve the goals set forth by the United\r\nNations. Despite the difficulties just spelt out by Judge\r\nCassese, the Tribunal has become a fully operational\r\njudicial body. We note from the report that, during the\r\nperiod under consideration, the Trial Chambers and the\r\nAppeals Chamber were quite busy with the cases before\r\nthem. Dozens of public and sealed indictments were\r\nissued; 20 indicted individuals, including some leaders\r\ninvolved in criminal acts, are currently under\r\napprehension in The Hague. One trial and two sentencing\r\nprocedures were completed in this period.\r\nWe commend the endeavours of the President of the\r\nTribunal, the outgoing judges and other members of the\r\nTribunal for their tireless efforts to uphold justice. We\r\nalso congratulate the newly elected judges, who are about\r\nto assume their important responsibilities. We feel that for\r\nthe smooth and effective functioning of the Tribunal, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council pay due attention to the financial and\r\npractical problems of the Tribunal, as illustrated in the\r\nreport and briefly explained by Judge Cassese.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nHowever, it seems appropriate at this juncture to recall\r\nthat, with the wide scope of atrocities committed in the\r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia, it is quite obvious that\r\nthe trial of a few criminals and the indictment of some\r\nothers fall far short of the realization of the objectives of\r\nthe Tribunal. A historic responsibility at a very critical\r\njuncture has been entrusted to the Tribunal. That\r\ninternational legal body, which enjoys the support of the\r\ninternational community, should redouble its efforts, fulfil\r\neffectively and expeditiously the responsibility assigned to\r\nit by the Security Council resolutions and ensure that under\r\nno circumstances will the imperative of justice be\r\noverlooked.\r\nThe report before the Assembly illustrates the\r\npraiseworthy support and cooperation rendered by various\r\nStates and international organizations for the better\r\nfunctioning of the Tribunal. Since the inception of the\r\nTribunal, the Islamic Republic of Iran has strongly\r\nsupported its various activities aimed at terminating the\r\nculture of impunity. Accordingly, my country, as have done\r\nmany other States, has already expressed its readiness to\r\naccept the convicted persons so that they can serve their\r\nsentences in Iranian prisons. However, the report indicates\r\nthat some of the States or entities of the former Yugoslavia,\r\nin particular the so-called Republika Srpska, still resist full\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal and refuse to arrest and\r\ntransfer the main indictees to face justice. Such intractable\r\nrecalcitrance cannot and should not be tolerated by the\r\ninternational community and thus deserves to be\r\ncondemned.\r\nIt needs to be emphasized that the success of the\r\nTribunal in achieving its objectives is certainly tantamount\r\nto the success of human society in its fight against brutality.\r\nTo this end, it is indispensable that all nations put in place\r\nall the measures required to enable this Tribunal to fulfil its\r\nmission. It is also essential that the United Nations, as the\r\nfounder of the Tribunal, and the Security Council in\r\nparticular, adopt decisive measures, exert maximum\r\npressure on those States that persistently continue to\r\ndisobey the orders of the Tribunal and ensure that the\r\ndemand for international justice prevails over the interests\r\nof a few States. Let us ensure by our actions, as well as by\r\nour words, that culprits of heinous conduct will not be\r\ntreated with impunity.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Croatia): The Republic of Croatia\r\nassigns special significance to the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and its work. Indeed,\r\nmy country was instrumental in the Tribunal’s\r\nestablishment.\r\nCroatia was among the first countries to enact\r\nimplementing legislation so as to institutionalize its\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal. The Tribunal opened its\r\nLiaison Office in Zagreb, and the Croatian Government\r\nestablished its own Office for Cooperation with the\r\nTribunal. In this way, my country has fully regularized its\r\nrelations with the Tribunal.\r\nThe importance that Croatia attaches to the Tribunal\r\nis related to the recent well-known, most unfortunate\r\nevents. The aggression that was perpetrated against\r\nCroatia commenced in mid-1991. The attack upon Croatia\r\nwas directed almost completely against civilian targets.\r\nOver 8,000 people, mainly civilians, lost their lives and\r\n25,000 were wounded as a consequence of acts of\r\nheinous barbarity. Hundreds of thousands became\r\nrefugees or were internally displaced. Material damage\r\nincluded 15 per cent of the housing stock in the country,\r\nmany sites of historical, religious and cultural significance\r\nand communications infrastructure. Direct war damage\r\nalone has been estimated at $25 billion.\r\nSubsequently, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, following\r\nthe same formula, aggression cost many more lives, and,\r\nin combination with the aggression in Croatia, caused the\r\nbiggest refugee crisis in post-Second World War Europe.\r\nAt its height, Croatia, whose pre-war population was 4.5\r\nmillion, was caring for 750,000 refugees and displaced\r\npersons.\r\nIt is clear that in any war all sides commit at least\r\nsome crimes. However, it is equally clear that there is a\r\nvast difference between the isolated crimes of individuals\r\nand those crimes which are used as tools for the\r\nachievement of some collective political aim. Croatia was\r\nthe victim of this latter and far more dangerous form of\r\ncrime. Consequently, my country was among the first that\r\ncalled for the establishment of an ad hoc war crimes\r\ntribunal. The International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia was ultimately established in May\r\n1993, primarily to contribute to peace by dispensing\r\njustice to the victims. Croatia looks back today at this\r\nlaudable aim and finds it to be only partly fulfilled.\r\nDue to the limited resources of the Tribunal as\r\ncompared to the magnitude of the crimes committed, it\r\ncan only carry out its work in a selective manner.\r\nTherefore, the priority in deciding which crimes and\r\nwhich perpetrators to pursue carries more importance than\r\nit otherwise would. Indeed, the perception that is created\r\nas a consequence of the prosecutions that are pursued and\r\nthe indictments that are issued is crucial.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nCroatia cannot be entirely satisfied with this aspect.\r\nThe composition of the group of people who have been\r\nbrought before the Tribunal does not yet approach a proper\r\nreflection of what occurred during the conflict. For all the\r\nwar crimes committed against Croatian citizens, which I\r\nbriefly outlined earlier, only five indictments exist and only\r\none of the accused is before the Tribunal. Because of the\r\nlimitations of the Tribunal, it is the responsibility of the\r\ninternational community to do its utmost to equitably\r\nreflect, in the cases before the Tribunal, the events that took\r\nplace. In the estimation of Croatia, to date the international\r\ncommunity has fallen short of the mark. The countries\r\nwhich have cooperated with the Tribunal are those which,\r\noverwhelmingly, were also the victims of the aggression,\r\nwhereas the aggressors have refused to cooperate. This\r\nsituation has significantly detracted from the dispensation\r\nof justice. In addition, it has aided those who for various\r\nreasons might wish, in spite of the objective fact of the\r\naggression, to impose their own “truth” about the nature of\r\nthe conflict.\r\nCroatia does not condition its cooperation with the\r\nTribunal upon the reciprocal cooperation of any other\r\ncountry. Croatia considers cooperation to be a legal,\r\npolitical and moral duty. However, a situation such as the\r\none at present, in which Croats from Croatia and Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina make up 70 per cent of all the accused in\r\ncustody, serves to create a severely distorted picture of the\r\nreality of the conflict.\r\nThe international community must show more\r\nperseverance in executing the existing indictments, thereby\r\nbringing those persons it has already identified before the\r\nTribunal. The cause of justice will not be served unless\r\nthose who have been indicted for the crimes they\r\ncommitted against Croatian citizens are brought to account\r\nbefore the Tribunal. The human aspect of the return of the\r\ndisplaced Croatian population to Eastern Slavonia,\r\nparticularly Vukovar, will be seriously hampered unless this\r\noccurs. It was following the fall of Vukovar that the\r\nmassacre of several hundred of the city’s hospital patients\r\noccurred. The city remains a symbol of Croatian suffering\r\nduring the war. The Government’s own programme for\r\nreconciliation will be of diminished effect if the Tribunal is\r\nimpeded in carrying out its duty.\r\nAlthough the report accurately reflects most of the\r\ndevelopments, some require additional comments and\r\nclarifications. The reference in paragraphs 75 and 76 to the\r\n“rules of the road”, agreed in Rome on 18 February 1996\r\nin respect of Bosnia and Herzegovina, contains a\r\nmisinterpretation which Croatia has previously sought to\r\nclarify. Croatia supports the principle of the “rules of the\r\nroad” insofar as it applies to the territory of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. The principle was not meant to apply, and\r\ndoes not apply, to Croatia.\r\nThe assertions contained in the report have in some\r\nrespects been superseded by subsequent events. It should\r\nbe duly noted that the Republic of Croatia recently used\r\nits good offices in the transfer of 10 additional Bosnian\r\nCroat indictees into the custody of the Tribunal.\r\nFinally, Croatia recently successfully appealed a\r\nfinding of the Trial Chamber of the Tribunal in respect of\r\nsubpoenae duces tecum. The decision of the Appeals\r\nChamber to overturn the earlier finding has strengthened\r\nthe credibility of the Tribunal as an international judicial\r\nbody which acts within the authority assigned to it.\r\nAt the close of my remarks, I would like to pay\r\nspecial tribute to the work of the President of the\r\nTribunal, his Honour Antonio Cassese, who is coming to\r\nthe conclusion of his second and final term. He has\r\nbrought to the Tribunal the highest academic standards\r\nand professionalism. I am glad that he found the time in\r\nhis busy schedule to appear before the General Assembly\r\ntoday to deliver his report.\r\nThe Tribunal has, since its inception, made many\r\nsignificant contributions to international criminal\r\njurisprudence. It will continue to be very important in its\r\nown specific role, and also in the light of the discussions\r\nconcerning the future international criminal court. The\r\nwork of the Tribunal, just like that of the future\r\ninternational criminal court and the international\r\nprotection of justice in general, depends upon the\r\ncooperation of individual countries. It is the duty of the\r\nUnited Nations to encourage such cooperation or to take\r\nappropriate steps if needed.\r\nMr. Çelem (Turkey): With the signing of the\r\nDayton Agreement, a new political era began in the\r\nturbulent region of the former Yugoslavia. But the way\r\nahead is still fraught with dangers, and there may be\r\nsetbacks on the difficult road to a just and viable peace\r\nand political stability. In the search for peace, one has to\r\ntake into account the delicate balance between the need to\r\nend a crisis and the necessity of finding a satisfactory\r\npolitical settlement. Ending a conflict and human\r\nsuffering, and then achieving peace, without sacrificing\r\njustice, is of fundamental significance.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nIn this context, the successful functioning of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\nis imperative for the full implementation of the Dayton\r\nPeace Agreement, as well as for the establishment of lasting\r\npeace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nI would like to thank President Antonio Cassese for\r\nhis submission of the enlightening report of the Tribunal. It\r\nis indicated in the report that there has been very little\r\nprogress with regard to the implementation of the Dayton\r\nPeace Agreement by the parties as far as the Tribunal is\r\nconcerned. In this context, we welcome the continuing\r\ncooperative approach demonstrated by two States, Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina and Croatia, as pointed out in the report.\r\nOn the other hand, it is regrettable that this cooperative\r\nattitude was not displayed by the other parties.\r\nThis fact was also emphasized in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General dated 8 September 1997 on the United\r\nNations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the\r\nObservations section of this report, the Secretary-General\r\nstates that\r\n“the authorities in the Republika Srpska have followed\r\na policy of minimum implementation of the peace\r\nagreement”. [S/1997/694, para. 47]\r\nThe Secretary-General further indicates that this entity of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has done little or nothing to erase\r\nthe effects of “ethnic cleansing” and for the return of the\r\nrefugees to their homes.\r\nThe prerequisite for the implementation of the Dayton\r\nPeace Agreement, as with any international agreement, is\r\nthat all parties have to comply with the letter and spirit of\r\nits provisions. Refusal to comply with this commitment,\r\nafter formal recognition of the Tribunal and the undertaking\r\nto cooperate with it, constitutes a violation of the\r\nAgreement. This point has been duly made in the report\r\nsubmitted by the President of the Tribunal. For the\r\nnormalization of relations in the territory of the former\r\nYugoslavia and the attainment of the goal of a functioning\r\nunion in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a new atmosphere of\r\ntrust and security has to be built between the parties. This\r\ncan be attained only by respecting the rule of law.\r\nWe have carefully studied this fourth annual report of\r\nthe Tribunal submitted by Judge Cassese and listened a\r\nwhile ago with great interest to the statement he made.\r\nMost of our concerns are reflected in the report and the\r\nstatement. We take note of the fact that the Trial Chambers\r\nof the Tribunal, in the period from 1 August 1996 to 31\r\nJuly 1997, were busy with several cases, and the accused\r\nin the Erdemović case was sentenced to 10 years’\r\nimprisonment by the Trial Chamber. There is also the\r\nsignificant recent development of 10 Croatians\r\nsurrendering to the Tribunal. This, we believe, is a\r\nturning point in the work of the Tribunal and would very\r\nmuch contribute to the achievement of its objectives.\r\nDespite these accomplishments, the Tribunal, due to\r\nno fault of its own, remains a partial failure. The majority\r\nof indictees continue to remain free. Apart from this fact,\r\nwe appreciate the work done by the Tribunal as a whole,\r\nand recognize its crucial and urgent problems, the most\r\nimportant one being the need to apprehend the military\r\nand political leaders who have been indicted. There is\r\nstrong dissatisfaction in the international community about\r\nthe fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in\r\nThe Hague, the military and political leaders responsible\r\nfor the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts\r\nof “ethnic cleansing” in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain\r\nfree. In order to bring these indictees before the Tribunal,\r\nthe appropriate legal and political measures have to be\r\nformulated and put into effect. Without achieving this, the\r\nideals of justice and peace rest in thin air.\r\nOn the other hand, problems such as insufficient\r\nfunding and personnel continue to hamper the effective\r\nfunctioning of the Tribunal. These problems must be\r\nurgently and effectively addressed in the United Nations\r\nwith a view to finding adequate solutions.\r\nIn conclusion, let me state that the termination of\r\nconflicts and the cessation of human suffering are among\r\nthe important objectives of humankind. However, in\r\nefforts aimed at ending a particular conflict, justice must\r\ncome into play at the right time. In Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the right time is about to be left behind.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Malaysia): My delegation has\r\ncarefully studied President Cassese’s report, and we share\r\nthe concerns of the Tribunal as highlighted in it.\r\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia was established four years ago with the main\r\nobjective of dispensing justice to the victims of genocide\r\nand atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia. My\r\ndelegation is gratified to learn from the report that the\r\nTribunal has made significant progress in carrying out the\r\nmandate entrusted to it by the international community to\r\nbring to justice the perpetrators of the horrendous crimes\r\nagainst humanity committed in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nespecially in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nnote that the Tribunal has successfully tried an indictee and\r\nhanded down a guilty verdict on him. He was sentenced to\r\n20 years’ imprisonment for his crimes. Another indicted\r\ncriminal, who pleaded guilty, has been sentenced to 10\r\nyears’ imprisonment. The trials of two other indictees are\r\nunder way, while three additional indictees are awaiting\r\ntrial in The Hague.\r\nMalaysia commends the Tribunal for these\r\nachievements. However, we consider that the trial and\r\nsentencing of a few criminals by the Tribunal is insufficient\r\nand falls far short of realizing its objectives, especially\r\nwhen the main perpetrators of these crimes remain free to\r\ncarry out their activities with impunity. My delegation is\r\ndisturbed to note that many of these indicted criminals are\r\nstill holding important official positions, some as police\r\nofficers in several locations, in violation of the Dayton\r\nPeace Agreement. Even more disturbing is that the most\r\nnotorious of these indicted criminals, Radovan Karadžić and\r\nRatko Mladić, are still free and continue to exercise\r\npolitical influence in the Serb entity, the Republika Srpska.\r\nTheir continued freedom constitutes a major hindrance to\r\nthe realization of the objectives of the Dayton Peace\r\nAgreement to bring peace and justice to Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nThe Dayton Peace Agreement, signed in December\r\n1995, obliges its signatories to cooperate fully with the\r\nTribunal by executing the arrest warrants and delivering the\r\nindicted criminals to the Tribunal for trial in The Hague.\r\nHowever, to our utter dismay, the parties to the Agreement,\r\nnotably the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and\r\nMontenegro) and the Serb entity, have persistently refused\r\nto meet their obligations, and seem to be getting away with\r\nit. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has not only defied\r\nthe orders of the Tribunal, but has failed to ensure the\r\nRepublika Srpska’s compliance with the Dayton Agreement\r\nby the execution of arrest warrants issued for more than 40\r\nindictees in its territory. We strongly deplore their failure,\r\nwhich constitutes a blatant violation of the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and their commitment to the Dayton\r\nAgreement and shows gross disrespect for international law.\r\nFull cooperation with the Tribunal by all parties in\r\nbringing the war criminals to justice is a fundamental\r\nobligation which must be honoured if genuine stability and\r\nlasting peace are to be consolidated in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. It is imperative that the international\r\ncommunity exert pressure on the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia and the Serb entity to comply with their\r\nobligations to the Tribunal. The Security Council, which is\r\nresponsible for the Tribunal’s establishment, should also be\r\nmore assertive in ensuring that Member States fully\r\ncomply with their obligations. Otherwise, the Security\r\nCouncil’s objective in establishing the Tribunal — to\r\ncontribute to the restoration of peace and security through\r\nthe prosecution of persons responsible for serious\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law — will be\r\ndefeated. The families of the victims of those appalling\r\ncrimes look to the Tribunal and to the international\r\ncommunity for restitution and an end to the immunity\r\nwhich the perpetrators seem to enjoy. The Tribunal’s\r\nfailure to arrest and bring those indicted criminals to trial\r\nwould be interpreted as a sign of weakness and would\r\nonly encourage and embolden others, now and in the\r\nfuture, to defy the Tribunal and the international\r\ncommunity. This cannot and must not be tolerated.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to emphasize the need for\r\nthe parties involved in the implementation of the Dayton\r\nPeace Agreement to extend their full cooperation to the\r\nTribunal. In this regard, we commend the recent efforts\r\nby the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in arresting an indicted\r\ncriminal in Serb territory. We hope that this welcome\r\ndevelopment will mark the beginning of a productive\r\nworking relationship between the Tribunal and SFOR.\r\nMy delegation would also like to stress the need for\r\nthe Tribunal to be given sufficient financial resources to\r\ncarry out its formidable task. We earnestly hope that the\r\ninternational community will be more forthcoming in its\r\ncontributions to finance the activities of the Tribunal.\r\nMalaysia, for its part, has so far contributed $2.5 million\r\nto its fund, and it will continue to lend its modest support\r\nto the Tribunal.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation congratulates President\r\nAntonio Cassese on the excellent report, and commends\r\nhim and his team of dedicated judges and officials for\r\ntheir untiring and determined efforts, despite limitations\r\nand obstacles, to ensure that the victims of genocide and\r\n“ethnic cleansing” are not denied justice, and that the\r\nperpetrators are punished as soon as possible. We also\r\nwish to convey our appreciation to the Government of the\r\nNetherlands for its cooperation with and support for the\r\nTribunal.\r\nMr. Babar (Pakistan): I would first like to convey\r\nmy delegation’s deep appreciation to President Antonio\r\nCassese for his lucid statement and for preparing a\r\ncomprehensive report on the performance of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nToday we can say with confidence that the Tribunal\r\nhas achieved significant success in realizing its defined\r\ngoals, particularly considering its difficult beginning owing\r\nto paucity of resources and other hurdles. It has no doubt\r\nmade a vital contribution to the cause of humanity. We\r\nmust also welcome the contribution of the Tribunal to the\r\nprocess of reconciliation and peace-building in the former\r\nYugoslavia, highlighting that there can be no real peace\r\nwithout justice.\r\nThe International Tribunal has much still to do before\r\nit can claim that justice has been meted out for the\r\naggrieved people of former Yugoslavia. Security Council\r\nresolution 827 (1993) called upon “all States” to cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal in order to ensure its effective\r\nfunctioning. In this regard, we appreciate the cooperation\r\nextended by Croatia and the central authorities of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. However, cooperation from the other\r\nparties is not satisfactory. Despite repeated appeals from the\r\ninternational community, one of the parties has not yet\r\ntaken measures to enact legislation enabling it to cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the States which promoted ethnic\r\ncleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina are now trying to\r\nprotect criminals through various legal stratagems. They are\r\nputting forward different excuses to delay and hinder the\r\nprocess of dispensing justice to the victims. The provisions\r\nof the Dayton Agreement are most comprehensive and\r\nshould be implemented by all parties. The solemn\r\ncommitment made at Dayton must be complied with to\r\nensure proper criminal proceedings against the war\r\ncriminals. We must not allow any violation of the Security\r\nCouncil resolution or undermining of the Tribunal’s\r\nprimacy.\r\nIf speedy justice is to be ensured, the States must help\r\nin apprehending the indicted criminals. The international\r\ncommunity must ensure full and timely implementation of\r\nall aspects of the arrangements agreed to by the parties.\r\nThe main perpetrators of genocide and “ethnic\r\ncleansing” in Bosnia and Herzegovina — Radovan Karadžić\r\nand Ratko Mladić — are still at large and enjoying a\r\nfreedom they do not deserve. They continue to play an\r\nactive role in the politics of Republika Srpska. These\r\ncriminals must surrender to the rule of law without any\r\ndelay. We believe in the famous dictum: “Justice delayed\r\nis justice denied”.\r\nRecently one party has questioned the impartiality of\r\nthe Tribunal, with a view to tarnishing its image. We have\r\nfull confidence in the impartiality of the Tribunal. The\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)\r\nand the Republika Srpska have also suggested that the\r\nperpetrators of heinous crimes should be tried in their\r\nown countries. This is indeed a malicious campaign to\r\ndilute the role of the Tribunal and the international\r\ncommunity. We must strongly oppose such a move.\r\nMy delegation would like to welcome the\r\ncooperation extended to the Tribunal by the United\r\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia,\r\nBaranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) and the\r\nStabilization Force (SFOR) in arresting two indicted\r\ncriminals. The report of the Tribunal has termed this a\r\n“critical turning point”. We should welcome these\r\ngestures while urging the need to formalize their\r\ncooperation as envisaged in the Dayton Accords.\r\nThe Prosecutor of the Tribunal has rightly pointed\r\nout the need for continued assistance from\r\nImplementation Force (IFOR) and SFOR troops for the\r\nexhumation of mass graves in the insecure areas of\r\nformer Yugoslavia. That is a genuine demand which must\r\nbe heeded. The forensic activities in the mass grave sites\r\nshould be carried out as quickly as possible. Delay in that\r\nwork is likely to destroy the evidence which is so vital\r\nfor effective prosecution against such heinous crime.\r\nIn conclusion, Pakistan has consistently provided\r\nmoral and financial support to the Tribunal. Pakistan has\r\nso far contributed $1 million out of the total contribution\r\nof $8.6 million received by the Tribunal. We note that the\r\nTribunal continues to suffer from a shortage of funds. We\r\nurge all Member States to contribute generously to the\r\nVoluntary Fund to Support the Activities of the Tribunal\r\nto enable it to carry out its functions and responsibilities\r\neffectively and efficiently.\r\nMr. Burleigh (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States Government wishes to thank President\r\nAntonio Cassese of the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia for his address before this\r\nbody today. President Cassese’s stewardship of the\r\nYugoslav Tribunal during its first four years of existence\r\nhas been commendable. Under his leadership, the\r\nTribunal grew from a mere piece of paper to a fully\r\nfunctioning international criminal tribunal investigating,\r\nprosecuting and judging the fate of individuals charged\r\nwith crimes under international law. This was no small\r\nachievement. In fact, it has been a historic undertaking,\r\nfor which President Cassese can take much credit. We are\r\npleased that President Cassese will continue his work with\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nthe Yugoslav Tribunal as Judge Cassese and thank him for\r\nhis dedication to the pursuit of international justice.\r\nIn his address, President Cassese pointed to the\r\nobstacles and problems confronting the Yugoslav Tribunal.\r\nWe share his concerns. With the recent taking into custody\r\nof more indictees by the Yugoslav Tribunal and by the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the number of\r\ntrials in The Hague and in Arusha necessarily must\r\nincrease, thus requiring more support from this body.\r\nIn international litigation, particularly of this character\r\nwhere investigations are of the most complex nature, the\r\nevidence is primarily found with witnesses rather than in\r\ndocuments, and the investigators must carry our their work\r\nin countries other than the one in which they are based. The\r\ncost is therefore necessarily high. Any comparison of\r\ncomparable or even less complicated investigations at the\r\ndomestic level shows how high the costs can be. Usually,\r\nthe figures for a major national investigation and\r\nprosecution, as high as they are, in the tens of millions of\r\ndollars, do not reflect the additional high costs of defence\r\ncounsel, judges, and courtroom administration.\r\nAt the Yugoslav Tribunal as well as at the Rwanda\r\nTribunal, the entire cost of judicial proceedings is reflected\r\nin their respective budget requests to the United Nations.\r\nOn a comparative basis, these budget requests pale in\r\ncomparison to comparable budget figures in national\r\nsystems. While management problems in the past hobbled\r\nsome of the critical work of the Rwanda Tribunal, we\r\nbelieve that both Tribunals are now on track and, with\r\nproper oversight, deserve our full support.\r\nThe United States strongly urges Member States to\r\nexamine carefully the calendar year 1998 budget requests\r\nof both the Yugoslav and Rwanda Tribunals and to support\r\nbudget levels in the Fifth Committee that will enable these\r\ntwo bodies to fulfil their responsibilities. This is particularly\r\nimportant as more indictees come into custody and as\r\ninvestigations continue of those most responsible for serious\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law in the former\r\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda.\r\nThe United States also recognizes the possible need\r\nfor more judges for both Tribunals and looks forward to\r\nexamining specific requests in the Security Council and the\r\nbudgetary implications of those requests.\r\nWe reaffirm President Cassese’s request that all States\r\nand entities cooperate fully with the Yugoslav Tribunal.\r\nThere is no justification for the near-total non-cooperation\r\nof Republika Srpska and the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia with the order of the Tribunal, particularly in\r\nthe apprehension of indictees in areas under their control.\r\nThe recent cooperation of the Government of Croatia in\r\nfacilitating the surrender of indictees is commendable, but\r\nmore cooperation from Croatia is required. The United\r\nStates Government will continue to use every tool at its\r\ndisposal to compel cooperation and to strengthen the\r\ncapabilities of the Yugoslav Tribunal.\r\nThe United States joins with other Member States in\r\ncontinuing to support the work of the war crimes\r\nTribunals. We are determined that justice will be rendered\r\nand that the people of the former Yugoslavia and the\r\ncitizens of Rwanda will discover some reconciliation in\r\nthe accountability of those individuals responsible for\r\nthese heinous crimes.\r\nMr. Sáenz-Biolley (Costa Rica) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation is pleased to participate in this\r\ndiscussion on the report of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law Committed\r\nin the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991.\r\nFirst, through you, Sir, I should like to thank Judge\r\nAntonio Cassese, President of the Tribunal, for his\r\ndetailed assessment of the work of that important body.\r\nCosta Rica believes that there can be no peace\r\nwithout justice, no reconciliation without truth being\r\nbrought to light, and that a free and democratic society\r\ncannot be built so long as the criminal perpetrators of the\r\nmost horrible atrocities continue to go completely\r\nunpunished. Impunity is a serious threat to peace,\r\nprompting the victims to seek vengeance and bolstering\r\nthe aggressors’ arrogance. Against this background, the\r\nexistence of the Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is an\r\nindispensable element of the peace process in the\r\nBalkans. My delegation therefore can do no less than\r\nrepeat its firm and total support for the Tribunal’s work.\r\nThe last four years have been an historic period for\r\nthe Tribunal and, generally speaking, for the international\r\nadministration of justice. During this period, the Tribunal\r\nhas not only consolidated its administrative base and\r\nadopted its Rules of Procedure and Evidence, but has\r\nbegun to hear a small but important number of cases. The\r\nTribunal has also set important precedents, milestones in\r\ninternational jurisprudence, regarding trial procedures. In\r\nthis connection, my delegation notes with particular\r\npleasure the developments in both the practice and the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nRules of the Tribunal regarding the protection of victims\r\nand witnesses, as well as the accurate interpretation,\r\ncharacterization and definition of crimes perpetrated against\r\nwomen and girls.\r\nMoreover, my delegation considers that the work of\r\nthe Tribunal has been of paramount importance in the\r\ndevelopment of international humanitarian law and\r\ninternational human rights law. The jurisprudence of the\r\nTribunal has become an authorized interpretation of\r\ncustomary international law and a catalyst for the\r\nprogressive development of that law in the areas where as\r\nyet there are gaps or a lack of precision. Moreover, the\r\nvery existence of this Tribunal has given indispensable\r\nimpetus to the creation of the international criminal court,\r\nwhich is currently the subject of negotiations, and which\r\nCosta Rica hopes will be established in 1998.\r\nOver the past four years, Costa Rica has had the\r\nprivilege of having one of its most distinguished citizens,\r\nDr. Elizabeth Odio-Benito, serving as a judge of the\r\nTribunal. Costa Rica was honoured by the election of Judge\r\nOdio-Benito to serve as Vice-President of the Tribunal. In\r\nher work, Judge Odio-Benito has enjoyed the full support\r\nof the people and Government of Costa Rica, and she has\r\ngiven us cause for national pride. The term of office of\r\nJudge Odio-Benito is about to end. However, she will\r\ncontinue to exercise her functions for a short additional\r\nperiod, until the Čelebići, case proceedings, which began\r\nduring her term of office, have been concluded. In this\r\nwork, she will continue to enjoy the full support of the\r\npeople and Government of Costa Rica.\r\nOn the other hand, not all the news about the work of\r\nthe Tribunal is so positive. The lack of cooperation on the\r\npart of some Governments and local authorities, in violation\r\nof their international obligations, is scandalous. The\r\nauthorities of the Republika Srpska, the Federation of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) must comply with\r\ntheir international obligations. The authorities of these\r\nentities must arrest and transfer to the custody of the\r\nTribunal the accused who are in their territories. These\r\nauthorities must also cooperate in the gathering of evidence\r\nand facilitate the participation of witnesses. More\r\nimportantly, these authorities must bring to justice the\r\npossible authors of crimes. It should not be forgotten that\r\nthe existence of the International Tribunal does not release\r\nthese entities from their governmental obligation to\r\nadminister justice and punish the guilty.\r\nWe are also particularly concerned that some of the\r\nindictees still hold public office in the politico-\r\nadministrative structures of those entities. This is the most\r\nserious form of impunity and the most flagrant violation\r\nof the fundamental right of victims to justice. And thus\r\none of my country’s recurrent themes in the Security\r\nCouncil is the obligation of those entities to cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal. Both the Tribunal and the Security\r\nCouncil must continue to urge those entities to recognize\r\nthe necessity for them to give the Tribunal due\r\ncooperation. However, this task must continue to be the\r\nexclusive responsibility of political bodies. Judges of the\r\nTribunal should avoid the temptation to negotiate directly\r\nwith States in the region; this runs counter to the judges’\r\njudicial function.\r\nAnother problem area is the financial situation and\r\nthe lack of staff. There can be no doubt that the Tribunal\r\nneeds more resources and more staff. The financial\r\nauthorities of the United Nations and our own delegations\r\nin the Fifth Committee must do more to ensure that the\r\nTribunal has the necessary resources.\r\nIn conclusion, I would once again like to reiterate\r\nthat Costa Rica gives its full and unwavering support to\r\nthe work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): Allow me to convey through\r\nyou, Sir, my deep appreciation of the report of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\r\nand of its presentation by the Tribunal’s President, Judge\r\nAntonio Cassese. I associate myself with the statement\r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg on\r\nbehalf of the European Union.\r\nGiven my Government’s deep respect for the\r\nindependence of the Tribunal, I will refrain from\r\ncommenting on its work. The Tribunal’s report, presented\r\nso lucidly by the President of the Tribunal, gives us a\r\nclear and comprehensive account. As in the last session\r\nof the General Assembly, I wish, however, to underline\r\nagain the obligation of States to cooperate with the\r\nTribunal under Security Council resolution 827 (1993). In\r\nmy Government’s view, a stable and lasting peace in the\r\nBalkans can only come about if justice is done and war\r\ncriminals, of whatever nationality or ethnic identity, are\r\nduly prosecuted. At the end of our century, which has\r\nseen the most frightful atrocities, it cannot be tolerated\r\nthat systematic killings for the purpose of “ethnic\r\ncleansing” go unpunished. Germany is extremely grateful\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nto the Tribunal for the pioneering role it has assumed in\r\nthis important context.\r\nMy country has made every effort to contribute to the\r\nprosecution of violations of humanitarian law in the\r\nBalkans and will continue to do so. Germany was one of\r\nthose that actively supported the establishment of this\r\nTribunal right from the beginning. We have continued\r\nvigorously to support its work in the political and legal\r\nfields. We have also assisted with personnel and financial\r\ncontributions. Germany is, in fact, the third largest\r\ncontributor to the Tribunal’s budget. May I be forgiven in\r\nthese difficult times for pointing out that all of our\r\ncontributions have been paid on time.\r\nThe cooperation of the German authorities with the\r\nTribunal is regulated in a statute passed by the German\r\nparliament in April 1995. My Government extradited two\r\nmen charged with war crimes to the Tribunal. The\r\nextradition of Duško Tadić by Germany to The Hague was\r\nthe very first extradition to the Tribunal by a Member State.\r\nGermany has also declared its readiness to execute\r\nsentences handed down by the Tribunal.\r\nGerman law enforcement authorities cooperate closely\r\nwith the Tribunal in order to ensure an effective and\r\ntransnational prosecution of violations of humanitarian law.\r\nThese efforts include special protection for those of the\r\nmany refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina on German\r\nterritory who are required by the Tribunal as witnesses.\r\nDue to the principle of legal universality introduced by\r\nthe 1995 statute, German authorities investigate violations\r\nof humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia\r\nregardless of the citizenship or residence of the suspects. In\r\ntwo instances, German courts have pronounced prison\r\nsentences in connection with violations committed in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The International Criminal\r\nTribunal in The Hague had been kept informed about the\r\ntrials and chose not to exercise its right to request\r\nextradition. At present, German law enforcement authorities\r\nare investigating further cases, again in close cooperation\r\nwith the Tribunal.\r\nAs I said at the beginning, the Yugoslavia Tribunal,\r\njointly with the one on Rwanda, plays a pioneer role. At the\r\nend of this century, we are faced with the historic\r\nresponsibility not to let war atrocities go unpunished.\r\nGermany is therefore actively committed to the\r\nestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.\r\nWe believe that a permanent court will greatly benefit from\r\nthe experience gained by the Yugoslavia Tribunal in the\r\nelaboration of the convention for its establishment and in\r\nthe initial period of self-organization.\r\nMr. Erdos (Hungary) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe delegation of Hungary wishes to associate itself with\r\nthe statement made by the Permanent Representative of\r\nLuxembourg, Mr. Jean-Louis Wolzfeld, on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. We also wish to thank President Cassese\r\nfor the introduction of his report, whose contents we\r\nwelcome. We must weigh the crucial importance of the\r\nsubject before us today for the future of humanity.\r\nI am making this statement in order to stress the\r\ngreat interest of Hungary in the activities of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia. The enormity of the tragedy is well reflected\r\nin the Tribunal’s report. My country, situated adjacent to\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, was particularly affected by the\r\nrepercussions of this tragedy. Ethnic and religious\r\nintolerance, the policy of “ethnic cleansing” and the acts\r\nof barbarity that accompanied events in the former\r\nYugoslavia are a deeply tragic and very relevant warning\r\nabout the quality and solidity of our civilization on the\r\ncusp of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe forum that the Security Council decided to\r\nestablish four years was designed to dispense justice; to\r\nprevent the perpetrators of crimes unprecedented since the\r\nlast war from enjoying impunity; and to facilitate the\r\nnormalization of relations, not just among the countries in\r\nthe territory of the former Yugoslavia, but also between\r\nthe peoples, the ethnic communities, the religious\r\ncommunities and individuals living in those territories.\r\nOur political and moral responsibility is enormous: to\r\nopen the way to the triumph of justice and the advent of\r\nnormal and harmonious coexistence between communities\r\nthat have, in fact, lived together for centuries and were\r\ncruelly ravaged by recent events with which we are all\r\nfamiliar.\r\nThe scope of this endeavour is particularly great\r\nsince, if the international community does not act\r\nresponsibly and without complacency, the example of\r\nevents in the former Yugoslavia and the impunity of those\r\naccused could, as the report states, embolden others to\r\nemulate the crime. Even with the passing years, we\r\ncannot forget how the international community erred in\r\naddressing this crisis by involuntarily encouraging those\r\nwho, over the course of time, felt increasingly\r\ncomfortable in giving free rein to their ethnocentric and\r\ninhumane aspirations, coldly established as systematic\r\ntheory.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nWe therefore deplore the absence of cooperation with\r\nthe Tribunal by certain countries and entities. Accordingly,\r\nwe deem unacceptable and disgusting the fact that many of\r\nthe accused still occupy high posts. Worse yet, in the light\r\nof the horrors committed, they continue to disseminate the\r\nideas of aggressive nationalism and to extol the “merits” of\r\nethnic segregation, which is in fact a new form of apartheid\r\nat the end of our century, this time in the heart of Europe.\r\nHungary, given the historic legacy of our region,\r\nrejects and will strongly continue to reject such ideas. We\r\ncall upon all members of the international community and\r\nall international forums to continue to support the\r\nTribunal’s work and to facilitate the total fulfilment of its\r\nmandate. After all, this is a question with direct bearing on\r\nthe future of international relations.\r\nMr. Zmeevski (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): Russia favours the just punishment of all\r\nthose guilty of crimes committed during the conflict in the\r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia. We continue to attach\r\ngreat importance to the work of the International Tribunal,\r\nestablished by a decision of the Security Council.\r\nHowever, we absolutely cannot agree with the\r\nattempts to describe as “cooperation” with the Tribunal or\r\nas “support” for its work preplanned actions for the armed\r\nseizure of suspects, in particular under the aegis of the\r\ncurrent peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe have repeatedly emphasized that such deliberate actions\r\nare not within the mandate of the multinational Stabilization\r\nForce, as outlined in the Peace Agreement.\r\nRussia does not intend to bear the responsibility for\r\nthe consequences of such unilateral actions, particularly\r\nsince our military contingent participates in the international\r\npeacekeeping force. At the time that the terms of our\r\nparticipation were being agreed, we objected to the arbitrary\r\ninterpretation of the mandate according to which police\r\nfunctions were assigned to the multinational Force. We\r\nconfirm that the Russian brigade will not take part in such\r\nactions. We are opposed to steps that could undermine the\r\nprocess of peaceful settlement in Bosnia, particularly since\r\nthey could jeopardize international peacekeepers, which\r\ninclude 1,500 Russian servicemen.\r\nOn the whole, we are concerned at the trend we have\r\nseen in recent months of an increase in military elements\r\nthat use force in the arsenal of the peacekeeping efforts in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nExperience has shown that military operations during\r\nthe discharge of a civilian task do not speed up the peace\r\nprocess. Quite the opposite; they slow it down,\r\nparticularly since in this case they are being used against\r\nonly one of the Bosnian parties. Reliance on the use of\r\nforce alone can only subvert the authority of international\r\nstructures among the civilian population of Bosnia and\r\ncreate a favourable climate for the work of extremists.\r\nThe problem of the extradition to The Hague of persons\r\nindicted of war crimes should be resolved only through\r\ncooperation among the parties themselves with the\r\nInternational Tribunal, as was stated in the international\r\ndocuments on the Bosnian settlement, in particular in the\r\ndecisions of the London Conference of 1996.\r\nWe are convinced that it is only through the\r\nadoption of this approach that the Tribunal’s work can\r\nfacilitate the ultimate goal of reaching a settlement in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia — the restoration and the\r\nconsolidation of peace in that region.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 49?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 26\r\nUniversity for Peace\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.10)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Costa Rica to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.10.\r\nMrs. Castro de Barish (Costa Rica) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I am very pleased to see the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Panama presiding over the plenary of\r\nthe General Assembly at this time, and it is a particular\r\nhonour for me to begin the consideration of item 26,\r\n“University for Peace”, and to address the General\r\nAssembly on behalf of the fraternal Republics of Central\r\nAmerica — El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,\r\nNicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica — on a subject to\r\nwhich we attach great importance.\r\nWe are meeting today in accordance with resolution\r\n50/41 of 8 December 1995, in which the General\r\nAssembly decided to include in the agenda of the fifty-\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nsecond session the item entitled “University for Peace” to\r\nconsider ways of strengthening cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the University for Peace. Since its\r\nestablishment by resolution 35/55 of 5 December 1980, the\r\nUniversity has set out to become what the then Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations — Javier Pérez de Cuéllar,\r\nwho is currently the President of the Council of the\r\nUniversity — termed the sole globally oriented United\r\nNations institution headquartered in Latin America.\r\nThe main objective of the University is to\r\n“provide humanity with an international institution of\r\nhigher education for peace and with the aim of\r\npromoting among all human beings the spirit of\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to\r\nstimulate cooperation among peoples and to help\r\nlessen obstacles and threats to world peace and\r\nprogress, in keeping with the noble aspirations of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations”. (Charter of the\r\nUniversity for Peace, article 2)\r\nThe true significance of the University’s activities lies\r\nin its cooperation with the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization in the effort to promote\r\na culture of peace in which cooperation and harmony would\r\nreplace the harmful and deeply rooted culture of violence\r\nand warfare.\r\nHere, I should like to comment on a relevant and\r\ninteresting point. During his recent visit to the University\r\nfor Peace last June, Facundo Cabral, the famous Argentine\r\nsinger-songwriter, said:\r\n“In a society as crazy as ours, the smartest thing to do\r\nis to stand aside. By not cooperating with insanity, we\r\nare already doing a great deal for sanity.”\r\nHe later added:\r\n“Mother Teresa said that the time would come when\r\nso many will stand aside that no one will be left to\r\nengage in the horror of warfare.”\r\nI must point out that in Central America, the\r\nUniversity for Peace has been cooperating in the\r\npacification process through projects on education for\r\npeace, a culture of peace, human rights, conflict resolution\r\ntechniques and the promotion of democracy. This active\r\npresence was crystallized in the Esquipulas II agreements\r\nof 7 August 1987, which laid the foundation for\r\ndemocratization and pacification in Central America\r\nthrough the creation of national reconciliation\r\ncommissions. The presence of the University made itself\r\nfelt once again when it suggested that the Central\r\nAmerican Presidents convene the first regional meeting of\r\nthe reconciliation committees, which took place at\r\nheadquarters of the University, in Colón, Costa Rica,\r\nfrom 18 to 20 September 1989. By promoting peace and\r\nreconciliation, the University has made a meaningful\r\ncontribution to resolving the Central American crisis. This\r\nled the Presidents of the region to declare Central\r\nAmerica, in December 1990, a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development — an inspiration in the\r\npresent as well as for the future, as has been noted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe University for Peace has national representation\r\nin 12 countries: Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador,\r\nSpain, Guatemala, Honduras, Italy, Nicaragua, Panama,\r\nPeru and Uruguay. The World Centre for Research and\r\nInformation on Peace was established earlier this year in\r\nMontevideo, the capital of Uruguay, by agreement\r\nbetween the Government of that country and the\r\nUniversity, which gave that Centre the status of regional\r\nsub-headquarters for South America.\r\nAmong the many seminars, courses, conferences,\r\nround tables and activities carried out by the University,\r\nI should like to note the establishment of the Central\r\nAmerican Peace Chair. This is a particularly important\r\ninitiative, as it establishes a lofty academic venue in\r\nwhich the most important leaders of the region can\r\nexpress themselves.\r\nSome of the activities we believe deserve emphasis\r\ninclude the international seminar on sustainable\r\ndevelopment and progress in the social field, which took\r\nplace from 15 to 17 January 1996 at the Centre for\r\nDemocratic Studies for Latin America. The seminar was\r\ncoordinated by the University for Peace, the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the Friedrich Ebert\r\nFoundation and the Inter-American Institute for\r\nCooperation on Agriculture. It concluded with a statement\r\ndesigned to facilitate the implementation of the\r\nagreements entered into with the Alliance for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, which was introduced at the fifteenth\r\npresidential meeting and announced at the Central\r\nAmerican Environment Summit for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, held in Managua on 12 and 13 October\r\n1994.\r\nThere was consensus on the prerequisites for the\r\nsustainable development of Central America, including\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nequal opportunity and access, social investment for human\r\ndevelopment, a consolidated culture of peace, making the\r\nhuman being the focus of development, and respect for\r\nethnic and cultural diversity. On the environment, the group\r\nagreed that legislation on environmental policies must be\r\nreviewed, revised and implemented and that the\r\nenvironmental and social ethos must be strengthened. In the\r\neconomic sphere it was considered that a redistribution of\r\nopportunities was necessary in order to generate wealth\r\nthrough a progressive tax system, job creation and a model\r\nfor self-propelled development.\r\nMaster’s degrees were awarded in the fields of\r\ncommunication for peace, international relations,\r\ndevelopment and peace, and ecology, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and peace. In 1998 the University will grant\r\na master’s degree in human rights and education for peace,\r\nand a first doctorate in communication for peace will be\r\nawarded in cooperation with the University of La Laguna,\r\nCanary Islands, Spain.\r\nIt is clear, then, that the challenges are great and the\r\nresources scarce. That is why the Governments of Central\r\nAmerica once again urge Members that have not yet done\r\nso to accede to the International Agreement for the\r\nEstablishment of the University for Peace, approved\r\nthrough the adoption of resolution 35/55, with a view to\r\nenabling the University to realize its theme: if you desire\r\npeace, you must prepare and educate for peace. The\r\nUniversity for Peace must be a laboratory for the spirit of\r\npeace, in which we must create a new mentality of peace\r\nas we approach the new millennium.\r\nI wish now to introduce draft resolution A/52/L.10 on\r\nbehalf of our sister republics of Central America — El\r\nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and my\r\nown country of Costa Rica — and the many other States\r\nMembers of the United Nations that have joined in\r\nsponsoring the draft resolution. The remainder of the 82\r\nsponsors are as follows: Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra,\r\nArgentina, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin,\r\nBolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Burundi, Cape\r\nVerde, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, Cyprus, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,\r\nEgypt, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia, Greece, Grenada,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait,\r\nLebanon, Liberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Marshall\r\nIslands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Monaco,\r\nMorocco, Nepal, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Papua New\r\nGuinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar,\r\nRepublic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian\r\nFederation, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino,\r\nSeychelles, Singapore, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Spain,\r\nSri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Thailand, The former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda,\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela and\r\nYemen.\r\nIn the preambular part of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly recalls the approval, by resolution\r\n34/11 of 14 December 1979, of the idea of the\r\nestablishment of the University for Peace, and lists the\r\nvarious resolutions the Assembly has adopted in that\r\nconnection, most recently resolution 50/41 of 8 December\r\n1995.\r\nIt recognizes that the University has suffered from\r\nfinancial limitations which have impeded the full\r\ndevelopment of the activities and programmes necessary\r\nfor carrying out its important mandate, but recognizes\r\nalso the important and varied activities carried out by the\r\nUniversity during the period 1993-1995, largely thanks to\r\nthe financial contributions made by Central America,\r\nCanada, Costa Rica and Spain and contributions by\r\nfoundations and non-governmental organizations. In this\r\nconnection, I want to stress the terms of the sixth\r\npreambular paragraph relating to the Trust Fund for Peace\r\nestablished by the then Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, with the assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, consisting of\r\nvoluntary contributions.\r\nBy the seventh and eighth preambular paragraphs the\r\nAssembly notes the various activities carried out in the\r\ncontext of the report of the Secretary-General entitled “An\r\nAgenda for Peace” and emphasizes the importance of\r\npromoting respect for the values inherent in peace and\r\nuniversal coexistence among human beings, such as\r\nrespect for life, friendship and solidarity between peoples\r\nand the dignity and integrity of persons irrespective of\r\ntheir nationality, race, sex, religion or culture.\r\nThe Assembly further expresses appreciation to the\r\nGovernment of Uruguay for establishing a World Centre\r\nfor Research and Information on Peace, and takes note of\r\nthe efforts being made by the United Nations and by the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization for the development and promotion of a new\r\nculture of peace, to which the University has devoted\r\nmany important efforts.\r\nThe operative part of the draft resolution is action-\r\noriented. Here the General Assembly requests the\r\nSecretary-General to consider ways of strengthening\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the University\r\nfor Peace and to submit a report thereon to the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. In paragraph 2, it\r\ninvites Member States, non-governmental organizations and\r\nintergovernmental bodies, as well as interested\r\norganizations and individuals, to contribute directly to the\r\nTrust Fund for Peace and to the budget of the University.\r\nBy paragraph 3, the Assembly invites Member States\r\nto accede to the International Agreement for the\r\nEstablishment of the University for Peace, thereby\r\ndemonstrating their support for a global peace studies\r\ninstitution whose mandate is the promotion of a global\r\nculture of peace.\r\nFinally, in paragraph 4, the Assembly decides to\r\ninclude in the agenda of its fifty-fourth session the item\r\nentitled “University for Peace”.\r\nThe sponsors hope that draft resolution A/52/L.10,\r\nwhich does not greatly differ from resolution 50/41,\r\nadopted at the fiftieth anniversary session of the General\r\nAssembly in 1995, will be adopted without a vote.\r\nMr. Olarte (Colombia) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIt is the view of the delegation of Colombia that, in the\r\ncontext of the United Nations programme of education for\r\npeace, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations\r\nInstitute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and the\r\nUnited Nations University should coordinate with the\r\nUniversity for Peace their educational plans based on\r\nconflict prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThe report on its activities submitted by the University\r\nfor Peace for 1995-1997 is satisfactory in view of the\r\nachievements made despite financial limitations.\r\nThe education provided by the University for Peace is\r\nan appropriate and effective tool to promote and develop\r\npeaceful coexistence. Its education plans should offer\r\nprogrammes or workshops aimed at creating societies\r\ncharacterized by peace, coexistence, respect for human\r\nrights and the promotion of development.\r\nOne element that generates internal conflicts disturbing\r\nthe peace, harmony and economic development within\r\nStates is the confrontation between capital and labour.\r\nEducation for peace must also envisage the training of\r\npeople to show more solidarity in the productive processes\r\nand be aware that harmony and balance in relations will\r\nimprove the quality of life at all levels.\r\nWe believe that the question as to whether peace is\r\na prerequisite for economic development or the\r\nconverse — that economic development is a prerequisite\r\nfor peace — has been sufficiently discussed and studied\r\nin academic and political circles. The conclusion is that\r\npeace and economic development are interlinked and\r\ninterdependent and that both aspects are simultaneously\r\ncause and effect.\r\nColombia promotes and supports the initiatives and\r\nactivities that have been taken to prevent violence and\r\nconflicts, and rejects violence as a tool in conflict\r\nresolution.\r\nThe delegation of Colombia is a sponsor of the draft\r\nresolution contained in A/52/L.10 on the University for\r\nPeace, and recommends that it be adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): Since the General Assembly’s\r\nfoundation of the United Nations University for Peace in\r\n1980, Italy has applauded this noble endeavour and the\r\ncommitment of its host country, Costa Rica, to making\r\nthe University a reality.\r\nAccording to article 2 of its Charter,\r\n“The University is established with a clear\r\ndetermination to provide humanity with an\r\ninternational institution of higher education for peace\r\nand with the aim of promoting among all human\r\nbeings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and\r\npeaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among\r\npeoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to\r\nworld peace and progress, in keeping with the noble\r\naspirations proclaimed in the Charter of the United\r\nNations.”[resolution 35/55, Charter of the University\r\nfor Peace, article 2]\r\nIn this day and age, when the news media continue\r\nto be dominated by stories of crises and outbreaks of\r\nconflicts in various part of the world, nothing could be\r\nmore valuable than the University’s emphasis on conflict\r\nprevention, peacekeeping and peace-building. One should\r\nnot — one cannot — underestimate how vital these three\r\nareas are to United Nations activities. In fact, it is our\r\nprofound conviction that educating individuals to the\r\nprinciples on which peace rests is, in the long run, the\r\nsoundest way to prevent conflicts and to promote the\r\ncauses of world peace, freedom, democracy and justice.\r\nThis approach to education as a tool for better and\r\nmore effective peacekeeping is one that Italy profoundly\r\nshares. In fact, my Government is committed to a series\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nof joint educational initiatives with countries that have\r\nexperienced first-hand the horrors of war or civil unrest. In\r\nthe framework of existing universities and research\r\ninstitutes, these programmes aim to strengthen cooperation\r\nin the field of post-conflict peace- building.\r\nThus, Italy is proud to co-sponsor draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.10 under consideration, and we fully support its\r\nadoption by this General Assembly.\r\nMr. Valencia Rodríguez (Ecuador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): The General Assembly, adopting the\r\nproposal of the President of Costa Rica in his address to\r\nthis Assembly at its thirty-third session, established the\r\nUniversity for Peace in its resolution 35/55 on 5 December\r\n1980, as an international centre specialized in postgraduate\r\neducation, research and dissemination of knowledge\r\nspecifically directed towards training for peace. In the\r\ncourse of its 17 years of work, this worthy institution has\r\nremained loyal to these lofty objectives, which could be\r\nsummed up as the search for peace through education, and\r\nthereby deserves our praise and recognition.\r\nThe University has accomplished many things which\r\nshould be emphasized. One that we might just mention is\r\nthe Gandhi Centre for Communication, which was\r\nestablished in 1985 by means of a programme of\r\ncooperation with the Italian Government and is responsible\r\nfor preparing and supervising plans for the production and\r\nprogramming of communication instruments for training,\r\neducation and information, as well as the training of\r\ntechnicians in the field of communication for peace.\r\nSimilarly, Radio for Peace International was also the result\r\nof joint efforts by the University and World Peace\r\nUniversity in Oregon, USA. It originated as a non-\r\ngovernmental organization to inform, educate and train for\r\na culture for peace. In the same way, the International\r\nCentre for Documentation and Information for Peace was\r\ngiven the function of identifying, collecting and\r\ndisseminating data and information relating to peace. It also\r\ndeals with topics such as human rights, international\r\nrelations, ecology, international law, and so on.\r\nThe University has offered a master’s programme in\r\ninternational relations since 1991, and the students are\r\ntrained to perform functions related to international issues,\r\nat both the governmental and non-governmental level. One\r\naspect of major importance today has not been overlooked\r\neither: in 1991 a master’s programme in natural resources\r\nand sustainable development was conceived. We hope that\r\nthe causes that have led that programme to be temporarily\r\nsuspended will soon disappear.\r\nAmong other current projects, one might note the\r\nmaster’s programme in human rights and education for\r\npeace, as well as the doctoral programme in information\r\nsciences for peace in the Great Caribbean, both of which\r\nwill begin in 1998.\r\nWe should add to these praiseworthy projects the\r\nestablishment in May 1997 in Montevideo, Uruguay, of\r\nthe World Centre for Research and Information on Peace,\r\nwhich was achieved through the generous support of the\r\nPresident of Uruguay, Mr. Julio María Sanguinetti.\r\nThe University is also carrying out various research,\r\ntraining and extension activities, including the\r\nInternational Programme on Indigenous Studies, the\r\nProgramme on Culture of Peace and Democracy in\r\nCentral America and the Programme on the Construction\r\nof Consensus and Strengthening of Negotiation in Central\r\nAmerica. As can be seen, these are questions of vital\r\nimportance not only for the region but for the entire\r\ninternational community. It is also carrying out academic\r\nextension activities, such as conventions, seminars,\r\nworkshops and short courses.\r\nI believe that the University is effectively achieving\r\nthe objectives for which it was established. We are\r\nwitnessing on a daily basis the resurgence of intolerance,\r\nviolence and non-respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms; incitements to hatred are spreading\r\nto many corners of the planet; many peoples are still\r\noppressed and are unacquainted with the great benefit of\r\nfreedom; and international disputes — which must be\r\nresolved exclusively by peaceful means, in accordance\r\nwith the San Francisco Charter — are continuing,\r\nimperilling peace and security. That is why I believe that\r\nthe United Nations should provide firm support to the\r\nUniversity for Peace and should call upon Member States\r\nto provide it all the support they can. At the same time,\r\nwe recognize and thank the Government of Costa Rica for\r\nits important contributions to facilitating and promoting\r\nthe activities of the University.\r\nMy delegation therefore asks the General Assembly\r\nto adopt the draft resolution before it without a vote.\r\nMr. González (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nChile attaches great importance to agenda item 26,\r\nentitled “University for Peace”, as it is part of our\r\ncontinuing pursuit of peace and the need for structured\r\ndialogue and harmonization based on a climate of mutual\r\ntrust and on the creation of a shared concept of\r\ninternational security.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nOur country has been working informally to develop\r\na new concept of security — that of sustainable security.\r\nThis concept stems from common roots, such as the\r\npromotion and strengthening of democracy and human\r\nrights, respect for ethnic and cultural values and the\r\nconsolidation of democratic regimes, that can be extended\r\nthrough time and reach future generations. In this context,\r\neducation for peace plays an absolutely indispensable role\r\nin contributing to the elaboration of this concept.\r\nWithin this framework, our country welcomes, with\r\nsatisfaction, hope and the desire to work together, the work\r\nof the University for Peace, whose latest report we have\r\nread thoroughly. As the report makes clear, the University’s\r\nresearch, training and extension activities have been far-\r\nreaching and productive. In this context, we congratulate\r\nthe Government of Costa Rica for its efforts to realize its\r\nobjectives.\r\nWe believe, however, that, without prejudice to the\r\ngeneral concepts to which we have referred, it is essential\r\nto have academic proposals that can deal in a very well-\r\ndefined manner with some of the global strategic threats\r\nthat undermine international peace and security. The issues\r\nof drugs and terrorism, among others, should be the subject\r\nof specific studies, which, coming from an eminent\r\nuniversity and a prestigious Government, would surely\r\nreceive appropriate international support. In this context, as\r\nin other areas of common interest identified by agreement,\r\nChile will contribute the necessary substantive support.\r\nWithin the context of the issue under consideration,\r\nwe would also like to welcome the establishment by the\r\nGovernment of Uruguay of the World Centre for Research\r\nand Information on Peace, which will act as a secondary\r\nsite of the University in the Southern Cone. Clearly, the\r\nfact that Uruguay is assuming responsibility for the Centre\r\nguarantees that its political, legal and academic credentials\r\nwill be irreproachable.\r\nIn particular, we should like to stress the significant\r\ncontribution of the University to the process of\r\npeacemaking in Central America. In this context, its\r\nprojects and extension activities have strengthened respect\r\nfor human rights and the consolidation of democracy and,\r\nmost importantly, have gradually made the people of the\r\nregion aware that they have an active role to play in the\r\nsearch for a culture of peace. We believe that our continent\r\nis becoming increasingly mature and eager to give that\r\nculture a central role in education projects and in the\r\nformulation of the new concepts of security that I\r\nmentioned earlier.\r\nHowever, despite all the progress that has been made\r\nand the great importance of the issue under consideration,\r\nChile notes with particular concern that only 34 States\r\nhave acceded to the International Agreement for the\r\nEstablishment of the University for Peace, which entered\r\ninto force on 7 February 1981, and more than half of\r\nthem are in the Latin American region. That is why we\r\nare ready to work closely with the Government of Costa\r\nRica and other countries in the region that are involved in\r\nthis important initiative so that more countries will accede\r\nto the Convention.\r\nFor these reasons, Chile, as a sponsor of draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.10, asks the General Assembly to adopt\r\nit without a vote.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): Bangladesh is pleased\r\nto participate in the debate on the plenary agenda item\r\nrelating to the University for Peace. Considering the\r\nimportant role that the University has been playing and\r\ncould play in the future, Bangladesh has been one of the\r\nsponsors of the relevant draft resolutions from 1980 to\r\ndate.\r\nThe Charter of the University for Peace conceives it\r\nas an institution for higher education in peace. It has the\r\nobjective of fostering a spirit of understanding, tolerance\r\nand peaceful coexistence. Its vocation includes teaching,\r\nresearch, interdisciplinary studies of all matters related to\r\npeace, postgraduate training and the dissemination of\r\nknowledge. In considering the agenda item, three\r\nquestions seem particularly pertinent. The first is whether\r\nthe thematic aspects, academic content and research\r\nprojects are focused on the pursuit of peace which\r\nconstitutes the objective and purpose of the University.\r\nThe second is whether a proper assessment or evaluation\r\nhas been made of the University’s contribution to\r\nadvancing the cause of peace. The third is whether the\r\nUniversity has been endowed with the necessary human,\r\nmaterial and financial resources to carry out its mission.\r\nAs the report provided to us by the University on its\r\nactivities during the last three years tells us, the academic\r\nand extra-academic activities of the University are\r\ndevoted to our common search for peace. In our view, the\r\nprogrammes of the University should cover\r\ninterdisciplinary or intersectoral studies of military as well\r\nas non-military threats to peace and security. Special\r\nfocus could be placed on a set of basic disciplines such as\r\ndevelopment, democracy, the rule of law, justice, good\r\ngovernance and human rights — factors that provide the\r\nfoundation of durable peace.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nThe University for Peace has, over the decade and a\r\nhalf or so of its existence, contributed to the understanding\r\nand pursuit of peace in Central America and beyond. We\r\nwish to see it gradually assuming a truly global vocation\r\nand significance within the perimeters of existing\r\ninstitutions such as the United Nations Institute for\r\nDisarmament Research (UNIDIR), United Nations\r\nUniversity and non-United Nations research organizations.\r\nIt is important that in the design of its academic and extra-\r\nacademic programmes, attention is given to avoiding\r\nduplication while not excluding complementarity. UNIDIR,\r\nfor example, has been engaged in the study of the linkages\r\nbetween peace and arms control and disarmament. The\r\nUniversity, while keeping the subject in its curricula, should\r\ndevote itself to other disciplines and develop expertise in\r\nother areas.\r\nWe would like to see the University not only as a\r\npowerhouse of ideas and concepts but also of innovative\r\nways and means for their realization. We are happy to note\r\nthat its programmes embrace “An Agenda for Peace”.\r\nFurther thought should be given to the expansion of the role\r\nand function of the University in efforts to understand and\r\npromote peace. It could, for instance, associate itself with\r\nthe efforts to realize the objectives of the ongoing United\r\nNations Decade for Human Rights Education, 1995-2004.\r\nAs we all know, the importance of respect for fundamental\r\nfreedoms and human rights in consolidating peace cannot\r\nbe overemphasized.\r\nWe have noted with satisfaction the special emphasis\r\ngiven by the University, in the context of the pursuit of the\r\nAgenda for Peace, to the area of peacekeeping, peace-\r\nbuilding, preventive diplomacy and the peaceful settlement\r\nof conflicts. It has continued to expand its activities, both\r\nacademic and extra-academic, despite resource constraints.\r\nIn this connection, we laud the establishment by the\r\nGovernment of Uruguay of the World Centre for Research\r\nand Information on Peace. The Centre, acting as the\r\nregional sub-headquarters of the University, will certainly\r\nmake an important contribution to the consolidation of\r\npeace in the region.\r\nThe resource constraints have unfortunately curtailed\r\nthe missions and potential of the University. We encourage\r\ngenerous contributions to the Trust Fund for Peace\r\nestablished by the United Nations Development Programme\r\nto receive assistance for this unique institution. We are\r\nconfident that a better understanding of its purposes will\r\nencourage greater and wider support for the University. I\r\nwould like to join in expressing our thanks to the\r\nGovernment of Costa Rica for hosting the University, thus\r\nmaking a significant contribution to the cause of peace.\r\nLast week, the Assembly considered the agenda item\r\nentitled “Towards a culture of peace”. The quest for\r\npeace, we argued, is not a cult. It consists in addressing\r\nthe factors that threaten or shatter peace among nations\r\nand within, among societies and within, among human\r\nindividuals and within. We find a natural kinship in the\r\nconcept of a culture of peace and what the University\r\npursues.\r\nAristotle said:\r\n“As all associations aim at some good, that\r\nassociation which is the most sovereign among them\r\nembraces all others and aims at the highest, that is,\r\nthe most sovereign of all goods.”\r\nThe most sovereign good — that highest value — is\r\npeace, and that is the quintessence of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nThe University for Peace naturally deserves the\r\nsupport of the association of nations we represent here.\r\nMr. Castellón Duarte (Nicaragua) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): First of all, I would like to express my\r\nsupport for the statement made by Ambassador Emilia\r\nCastro de Barish of Costa Rica on behalf of the Central\r\nAmerican countries.\r\nThe University for Peace is an institution created by\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly on 5 December\r\n1980. It has as its primary objective the search for peace\r\nthrough education. It follows the ideals of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights and its own charter. Its headquarters are in the\r\nRepublic of Costa Rica.\r\nThe University has specialized, inter alia, in the area\r\nof international relations, ecology and communication for\r\npeace, in national campaigns and festivals for peace, in\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, in reaching consensus\r\nin social and labour conciliation, and in the training of\r\nindigenous leaders.\r\nIn Central America, where the University is located,\r\nit has participated very actively, through its programmes\r\nand projects, in the peace processes that have taken place\r\nin our region since the conflicts of the 1980s and early\r\n1990s.\r\nIn our countries we have had a very valuable,\r\nenriching and productive experience with the University,\r\nwhich has had an impact on the achievement and\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nmaintenance of peace, the search for peaceful solutions to\r\nconflicts and respect for human rights. It has contributed to\r\nthe development of a culture of peace, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and democracy. This experience could serve\r\nas a valuable model, with the appropriate variations, in\r\nother geographical regions that have experienced conflicts\r\nsimilar to those we suffered in Central America.\r\nThe University recently established in Montevideo,\r\nUruguay, a World Centre for Research and Information on\r\nPeace, which will enjoy the status of regional sub-\r\nheadquarters of the University for Peace in South America.\r\nThe University also has national representatives in 11\r\ncountries: Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, Italy, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain and Uruguay.\r\nOne of the main ways the University transmits\r\nspecialized information not readily accessible in the world’s\r\nEnglish, Spanish or French media is Radio International\r\nPeace, established in 1987 by an agreement with the World\r\nPeace University in Oregon, United States of America. This\r\nstation was set up as a not-for-profit non-governmental\r\norganization designed specifically, among other things, to\r\ninform, educate and train for a culture of peace, with the\r\nobjectives of mass dissemination of concepts promoting\r\npeace and technical training in communication for peace for\r\ncommunicators in other media.\r\nThe University’s academic extension courses, at its\r\nmain campus and in other countries, reached more than\r\n2,500 students from 27 countries between 1995 and 1997.\r\nThe International Agreement for the Establishment of\r\nthe University for Peace entered into force on 7 April 1981.\r\nCurrently, 34 countries have acceded to it. We urge States\r\nthat have not yet done so to accede to this Agreement,\r\nthereby giving important moral support to the institutions\r\nand principles that guide it. Contributions to the University\r\nare voluntary.\r\nThe University is a dynamic institution that is trying\r\nto set up in the near future sub-headquarters in various\r\ncontinents, which will facilitate its presence and activities\r\nthroughout the world as a United Nations institution. To\r\nthat end, we invite interested States and institutions to\r\ncooperate with the efforts of the University authorities as\r\nthey try to obtain the financial resources necessary to\r\ndevelop their activities fully and fulfil their mandate to\r\npromote world peace.\r\nWe hope that the draft resolution (A/52/L.10) will be\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for my delegation and a very\r\ngreat personal privilege to see you, Ambassador Aquilino\r\nBoyd of Panama, presiding over this meeting.\r\nThe United Nations is the only Organization that can\r\nrestore peace and security in the world. The promotion of\r\ninstitutions that disseminate the concept of peace by\r\nmeans of education is thus essential to realize that\r\nobjective.\r\nInvolving all the actors that contribute directly or\r\nindirectly to building the concept of a culture of peace\r\nmeans engaging in a difficult but indispensable process of\r\ncontinuous learning in order to defend and ensure peace.\r\nThe University for Peace makes a distinctive and unique\r\ncontribution to the attainment of these objectives.\r\nArgentina is unconditionally committed to supporting\r\ninternational initiatives that will make it possible to\r\nachieve universal peace. Nothing could be more fitting,\r\ntherefore, than to further disseminate the activities\r\nundertaken by the University of Peace since its creation\r\n1980. In that regard, we support the initiative of our sister\r\nnation, the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, to establish a\r\nWorld Centre for Research and Information on Peace in\r\nMontevideo.\r\nWe also welcome as an extremely positive\r\ndevelopment the enhanced cooperation the University for\r\nPeace has enjoyed with Member States of the United\r\nNations, international organizations and non-governmental\r\norganizations, which has given the University an all-\r\nembracing yet integrated vision. Particular mention should\r\nbe made of the contributions of Costa Rica, Canada and\r\nthe Netherlands.\r\nThe signing of conventions and the development of\r\nbilateral and multilateral programmes of cooperation, as\r\nwell as the holding of courses, workshops and seminars\r\nand the operation of master’s and doctoral programmes,\r\nattest to the University’s excellence and seriousness as it\r\nworks to fulfil its commitments.\r\nThese actions have strengthened the role of the\r\nUniversity and allowed for alternative ways of improving\r\nquality of living, achieving sustainable development and\r\ncontributing to the progress of less developed cultures.\r\nIn summary, not even the visible support and\r\ncooperation that Member States of the United Nations\r\ngive the University for Peace will be enough. The\r\ndissemination of peace as a universal concept is not a\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 44th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 4 November 1997\r\nshort-term process but one that must be continuously\r\nnourished by new ideas and undertakings, since the\r\nsupreme and undeniable value of peace is at stake.\r\nGiven that it is only through the work and active\r\nparticipation of countries that a universal and lasting peace\r\ncan be achieved, our delegation supports the draft resolution\r\nsubmitted by Costa Rica, in the hope that the largest\r\npossible number of countries will cooperate in the task of\r\nthe University for Peace: to allow future generations to live\r\nin a world in which peace will not be unattainable, but will\r\nhave become a reality that gives rise to hope and the\r\nbuilding of a better world.\r\nMr. Pérez-Otermin (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation endorses the statements of\r\npreceding speakers and wishes to emphasize the importance\r\nUruguay attaches to the University for Peace and all the\r\nactivities of that prestigious entity.\r\nAmong those activities, we wish to note particularly,\r\nas did the representative of Costa Rica, the creation in\r\nUruguay of a sub-headquarters of the University for Peace.\r\nThe establishment of the World Centre for Research and\r\nInformation on Peace in Montevideo, our capital, has been\r\nmade possible through the wholehearted support of the\r\nRector of University, Mr. Francisco Barahona, and our\r\nPresident, Mr. Julio María Sanguinetti, with the generous\r\nassistance and cooperation of many other countries in our\r\nLatin American and Caribbean region.\r\nThe primary objective of the World Centre is to\r\ndisseminate information collected in a data bank, which will\r\ninclude a peace site. This operating system will allow for\r\nvirtually immediate communication via the Internet between\r\nresearchers and individuals, universities and other civil\r\ninstitutions.\r\nUruguay has read the report on the work of the\r\nUniversity for Peace from 1995 to 1997 and is carefully\r\nfollowing all of its varied activities. We would note\r\nespecially the generous assistance provided by the\r\nGovernment of Costa Rica throughout this period and wish\r\nto make the University’s work relevant to our region.\r\nUruguay, whose basic principles of foreign policy are\r\nfounded on respect for international law and the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, and which was one of the first to\r\naccept the binding jurisdiction of the International Court of\r\nJustice, all of which makes it a truly peace-loving country,\r\nis gratified by the great honour done it with the\r\nestablishment of the regional sub-headquarters of the\r\nUniversity for Peace on its soil.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\nresolution. May I take it that the Assembly decides to\r\nadopt draft resolution A/52/L.10 and Add.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.10 and Add.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 52/9).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly\r\nto conclude its consideration of agenda item 26?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.35 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
