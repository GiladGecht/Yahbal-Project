(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 48\r\nQuestion of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform representatives\r\nthat, following consultations regarding agenda item 48,\r\n“Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)”, and taking\r\ninto account General Assembly decision 51/407 of 25\r\nOctober 1996, it is proposed that the General Assembly\r\ndecide to postpone consideration of this item and to include\r\nit in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session.\r\nMay I take it, therefore, that the Assembly, taking into\r\naccount decision 51/407, wishes to defer consideration of\r\nthis item and to include it in the provisional agenda of the\r\nfifty-third session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded its consideration of agenda item 48.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/1)\r\nMr. Al-Hitti (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): My\r\ndelegation wishes to begin by welcoming the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization that\r\nwe are considering today. We commend the highly\r\npraiseworthy efforts that went into preparing the report.\r\nBut we believe that it might have been more useful had\r\nit avoided certain generalizations and imprecise\r\nconclusions as well as certain contradictions with regard\r\nto certain concepts and their applications.\r\nWe believe that the report in its analyses focuses on\r\nsymptoms and end results of international problems rather\r\nthan their root causes and on ways to deal with them. It\r\nalso provides generally an exposé in summary form of\r\ninternational problems and variables and of the efforts the\r\nUnited Nations has made to come to grips with them\r\nwithout giving adequate attention to exploring future\r\nhorizons. This is especially so as regards proposing\r\nconcrete solutions to problems which are battering our\r\nplanet at present, such as poverty, famine, the\r\ndeterioration of the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the widening gap between North and South\r\nand the absence of the principles of justice and equity in\r\ninternational relations, as well as the use of selectivity and\r\ndouble standards when it comes to the consideration by\r\nUnited Nations bodies of issues of grave international\r\nimportance such as peace, security, disarmament,\r\ndevelopment and other important international questions.\r\nTo save time, I shall be brief. I intend to focus on\r\ntwo paragraphs of the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nparagraphs 89 and 125 although there are comments\r\nregarding a number of other paragraphs.\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nWith regard to paragraph 89, the report refers to the\r\nuse of mandatory sanctions as a valuable tool available to\r\nthe Security Council, permitting the United Nations to bring\r\npressure to bear without recourse to force. We believe that\r\nthat may be true only from an abstract and theoretical\r\nperspective. But it ignores the framework in which this\r\ninstrument is included in the Charter, namely, that sanctions\r\nare to be imposed only after exhausting all peaceful and\r\npreventive means to seek a pacific settlement, as set forth\r\nin Chapter VI of the Charter. This was not the case with\r\nIraq.\r\nFurthermore, the Charter does not call for the\r\nimposition of sanctions as a blank cheque or as a means for\r\nrevenge and punishment. We wonder how economic\r\nsanctions can figure under the label of “preventive\r\ndiplomacy” and the pacific settlement of disputes when they\r\nlead to the death of more than a million and a quarter\r\ninnocent Iraqi citizens, most of whom are children, women\r\nand old people. In addition, 4 million Iraqi citizens have\r\nbeen subjected to famine and malnutrition, as has been\r\nrecognized in the latest joint report of the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and\r\nthe World Food Programme issued on 5 October 1997.\r\nIf the economic sanctions were really pacific and\r\npreventive measures, the United Nations would not have to\r\nreview them through a sub-working group on sanctions that\r\nreached important conclusions and recommendations that\r\nare totally disregarded in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nOtherwise, the Secretary-General’s representative,\r\nMs. Graça Machel, would not have included in her report\r\nlast year, on military confrontations and their implications\r\nfor children, the remark that caution should be exercised\r\nand precautions taken before sanctions are imposed against\r\nStates. What is important here is that economic sanctions,\r\nin view of their destructive consequences for populations\r\nand development and their sowing the seeds of future\r\nconflicts, can be anything but a preventive or peaceful tool.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General dealt with the\r\neconomic sanctions against Iraq as if they were to be\r\nimposed permanently and as if during the last seven years\r\nIraq had not implemented the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil in such a manner as to justify the lifting or\r\nreduction of such sanctions by the United Nations. If this\r\nis the case, then the United Nations, which is now trying to\r\nrationalize its expenses and reform its Headquarters and\r\nfield procedures, should review its work in Iraq, and should\r\nenquire of its teams and of the thousands of employees\r\nwhich it has been dispatching for the past seven years\r\nregarding Iraq’s compliance and the scope of their\r\naccomplishments at all levels.\r\nAs regards the oil-for-food formula referred to in\r\nparagraph 89, we wish to say that this formula has been\r\nemptied of its contents and of any implications of human\r\nsignificance because of the acts of incessant piracy on the\r\npart of the representatives of the United States and the\r\nUnited Kingdom within the boycott Commission to\r\nobstruct adoption and implementation of contracts\r\nproviding Iraq with food and medicine. For example, the\r\nrepresentative of the United States of America opposes\r\nthe provision of 100 ambulances to Iraq under the pretext\r\nthat that is a large number — as if Iraq were a small\r\ncountry and not a State that has 22 million citizens. The\r\nUnited States representative also rejects contracts for\r\nmedicine under the pretext that such contracts include free\r\nmedical supplies, and also certain contracts for batteries\r\nand tires for the trucks that are used for the transport of\r\nfood — claiming they are for dual use.\r\nEven if the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 986 (1995) could continue in spite of the\r\nAmerican and British obstacles, the provisions are\r\ninsufficient to meet even the essential human needs of the\r\nIraqi people. The average Iraqi would not have more than\r\n25 cents today if that resolution were fully implemented.\r\nTo date the resolution has only provided a small increase\r\nin Iraqi citizens’ allotment of flour and rice. As Jesus\r\nChrist said, “Man does not live by bread alone.” [The\r\nHoly Bible, Matthew 4:4]\r\nThe best and latest description of the implementation\r\nof resolution 986 (1995) is contained in the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\r\nand World Food Programme report to which we referred\r\na short while ago. That report states that despite the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 986 (1995)\r\n“malnutrition remains a serious problem throughout\r\nthe country”. [Special Report, FAO/WFP Food\r\nSupply and Nutrition Assessment Mission to Iraq, 3\r\nOctober 1997, part 1]\r\nIt also says,\r\n“the situation for the majority of the population had\r\nbecome deplorable ... This remains true today.”\r\n[ibid., part 5]\r\nIn the light of these judgements issued by United\r\nNations bodies, can paragraph 89 of the Secretary-\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nGeneral’s report be in line with the formula of oil-for-food?\r\nThat formula, according to the report, is\r\n“the first systematic attempt by the Council to address\r\nthe humanitarian needs of the citizens of a civilian\r\npopulation in a country remaining subject to\r\nsanctions”. [A/52/1, para. 89]\r\nA realistic evaluation of the results of the oil-for-food\r\nprogramme is that it has actually become a programme\r\nmaking up for compensation and reparations for the United\r\nNations. However, we wish to welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call to the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil to consider possible ways to render the sanctions\r\nless blunt and more effective.\r\nAs regards paragraph 125, we wish to say that the use\r\nof the word “military” to describe the mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) is not\r\ncorrect or precise, because it is well known to all that\r\nresolution 687 (1991), which was adopted in accordance\r\nwith Chapter VII of the Charter, deals with measures for\r\nimplementing post-conflict peace-building and does not deal\r\nwith military actions.\r\nAs regards the obstruction of the movement of this\r\nCommission and its being prevented from reaching the\r\npositions concerned, we wish to clarify that Iraq has always\r\nasked for differentiation between the essential issues,\r\nespecially those contained in resolutions such as resolution\r\n687 (1991) and other, secondary ones. Iraq has always\r\ncooperated seriously and sincerely with the Special\r\nCommission and its inspection teams in the performance of\r\ntheir missions in accordance with the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council. The Commission has recognized this\r\ncooperation more than once in its semi-annual reports to the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nHowever, it is regrettable that the members of these\r\ninspection teams sometimes go beyond the functions of\r\ntheir missions as prescribed by the Security Council, a\r\nmatter that led Iraq to establish a common, agreed\r\nprogramme of work with the Special Commission on 22\r\nJune 1996 in order to facilitate the work and modus\r\noperandi, especially when inspecting the sensitive areas in\r\na manner that does not jeopardize the country’s security.\r\nThe intelligence building, for example, was inspected more\r\nthan three times. When an inspection team asked to inspect\r\na section inside that building, it was told that that section\r\nhad nothing to do with the nature of the Commission’s\r\nwork.\r\nIt is regrettable that paragraph 125 selected only two\r\nsituations and described them as negative, without putting\r\nthem within the proper context to which we referred to\r\nearlier, and without balancing them against the positive\r\nand consistent record of Iraq’s cooperation with the\r\nSpecial Commission and all its efforts in the\r\nimplementation of its mandate as defined by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nAllow us, in conclusion, to quote from the end of the\r\nlast report of the Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), presented to the Security\r\nCouncil last month, in order to provide evidence of what\r\nwe are stating here. The report states,\r\n“monitoring and verification activities carried out\r\nsince April 1997 have not revealed indications of the\r\nexistence in Iraq of prohibited materials or\r\nactivities.” [S/1997/779, para. 43]\r\nBefore that, the Executive Chairman of UNSCOM,\r\nin paragraph 46 of his report, presented to the Security\r\nCouncil in April 1997, referred to Iraq’s commitment to\r\nthe Security Council resolutions as follows:\r\n“The accumulated effect of the work that has\r\nbeen accomplished over six years since the ceasefire\r\nwent into effect, between Iraq and the Coalition, is\r\nsuch that not much is unknown about Iraq’s retained\r\nproscribed weapons capabilities.” [S/1997/301,\r\npara. 46]\r\nUndoubtedly, this unambiguously shows that Iraq is\r\nfully committed to complying with the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council, which makes the\r\nCouncil, in return, duty-bound to comply with the\r\ncommitments it made to Iraq. The first of these is the\r\napplication of operative paragraph 22 of resolution 687\r\n(1991) regarding the lifting of the unjust economic siege\r\nagainst our country, in preparation for lifting the other\r\nsanctions against Iraq in order that it might return to its\r\nnatural regional and international status, a matter that\r\nwould preserve the interests of all and promote\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): We thank the\r\nSecretary-General for presenting a concise, straight-to-the-\r\npoint, yet comprehensive annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. The new format has greatly facilitated our\r\nstudy of the report.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nI wish to limit my remarks to a few specific\r\nobservations, but first, as a general observation, we are\r\npleased to note the numerous activities undertaken by the\r\nSecretariat in accordance with the mandates in the various\r\nfields outlined in the report, and we congratulate the\r\nSecretariat and the Secretary-General in this regard. The\r\nreport also reflects the comprehensive and global mandate\r\nof the Organization, as well as the key role of the United\r\nNations on issues of global concern.\r\nParagraph 16 suggests that globalization is the driving\r\nforce for development, but also refers to the need for a\r\nmore conducive external environment. We could not agree\r\nmore with this assessment, inasmuch as the globalization\r\nprocess should not be considered as a panacea or a\r\nsubstitute for adopting international policies aimed at\r\ncorrecting fundamental economic imbalances and promoting\r\ninternational cooperation to ensure that the benefits of\r\nglobalization are shared by as many as possible and not just\r\na few. Effective international cooperation in key areas, such\r\nas international trade and finance and direct foreign\r\ninvestment, is still urgently needed.\r\nAt the same time, although section B deals with the\r\nissues of international economic cooperation and sustainable\r\ndevelopment — and we should take into account that the\r\nGeneral Assembly has an agreed context in which the term\r\n“sustainable development” should be used — the report\r\nreflects, in our view, the creeping marginalization of the\r\nUnited Nations on development policy issues, despite the\r\nfact that the Agenda for Development was adopted earlier\r\nthis year.\r\nIn this regard, the report emphasizes the issues of\r\nsustainable development — that is, environment and\r\ndevelopment operations. Important as these are, there is\r\nnevertheless scant, if any, reference or allusion to the\r\nUnited Nations activities, role or influence in the area of\r\nglobal macroeconomic decision-making and policies. Issues\r\nrelating to international cooperation on core economic\r\nissues, such as finance, technology and investment, are\r\ninsufficiently covered, if at all. We see this not as an\r\nomission on the part of the Secretary-General, but as a\r\nreflection of the state of affairs in the United Nations with\r\nregard to global development policy matters and core\r\neconomic issues. Therefore, if the report’s meagre coverage\r\nof these issues is a reflection of present-day realities in the\r\nUnited Nations, it is essential that States Members of this\r\nOrganization correct this and restore real development\r\npolicy issues and concerns to the heart of the United\r\nNations agenda. Although the international policy context\r\nand setting may have changed as a result of the end of the\r\ncold war, continuing development challenges and\r\nproblems remain.\r\nOn section D, concerning preventive diplomacy, we\r\napplaud the various initiatives undertaken by the\r\nSecretary-General in this regard. The Philippines fully\r\nrecognizes the importance of preventing disputes from\r\nerupting into conflict. However, in considering this\r\nparticular issue, the Secretary-General might also wish to\r\ntake into account the fact that, after almost three years of\r\nnegotiation, Member States have yet to agree on an\r\noperational definition for this concept. Nor has agreement\r\nbeen reached on the principles for the conduct of\r\npreventive diplomacy by the United Nations. We therefore\r\nurge that negotiations be resumed on this subject as soon\r\nas possible in order to avoid recurring misunderstanding\r\nand concerns on the activities undertaken by the United\r\nNations in the name of preventive diplomacy.\r\nAt the same time, paragraph 79 of the report refers\r\nto the concept of preventive action. This term has not\r\nbeen considered by Member States. We therefore support\r\nthe call of the Non-Aligned Movement, made during the\r\ndebate on the Secretary-General’s reform proposals, that\r\nthe term “preventive action”, at least with regard to its\r\ndefinition and operational principles, be discussed and\r\nconsidered by the General Assembly at the earliest date.\r\nWe are also interested in receiving details on the\r\n“global watch” referred to in paragraph 79. Is this the\r\nsame as the early warning system? We are particularly\r\ninterested in knowing the type and sources of data or\r\ninformation used to maintain this watch, as well as the\r\ncriteria used to determine whether a particular situation\r\ncould be classified as a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Greater transparency of this activity is essential.\r\nWe subscribe in general to the Secretary-General’s\r\nconclusion in part III. However, we believe that the\r\nimplications of the reforms suggested in paragraph 174\r\nneed to be studied carefully by the general membership.\r\nThat paragraph suggests a reconfiguration of the balance\r\nof functions between the Organization’s legislative bodies\r\nand the Secretary-General, and proposes a number of\r\nmeasures to create a balance between the General\r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General. Given the clear\r\ndistinction provided in the Charter of the roles of the\r\nprincipal United Nations organs, this suggestion requires\r\nclarification and examination by this body.\r\nEssentially, we believe that any reconfiguration in the\r\nbalance of functions between the General Assembly and\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nany other principal United Nations organ should aim at\r\nstrengthening and not weakening or diluting the role and\r\npowers of the General Assembly as defined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. The views of my delegation on the\r\nspecific measures referred to in this paragraph have been\r\nstated in the course of the discussions on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform proposals.\r\nFinally, allow me once again to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General for his report. We hope that future\r\nreports on the Work of the Organization will be presented\r\nwith similar brevity and precision.\r\nMr. Londoño (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I wish to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for\r\nhis very complete report, contained in document A/52/1.\r\nThe climate in the world today is one of integration,\r\nglobalization and multilateral trade. Significant progress has\r\nbeen made in this respect and millions today enjoy better\r\nproducts, the modernization of their systems and a guiding\r\nvision for their aspirations to progress on the threshold of\r\nthe coming millennium. Nonetheless, and as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has pointed out, not everyone enjoys the benefits\r\nof this new world climate. Continents like Africa share a\r\nmeagre 4 per cent of direct foreign investment.\r\nThis statistic is unwelcome from any standpoint; it\r\nreflects the assertion that we need to be aware and to\r\nunderstand that any interest in national well-being which\r\nlacks a global consciousness can lead to a balance sheet\r\nthat may be positive in the short term, but in the long run\r\nis imbalanced for all humanity. In his report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral refers to the need to combine pro-growth policies\r\nat the national level with targeted external assistance as an\r\neffective means of achieving the development of the least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nIn spite of valiant efforts, a great deal needs to be done\r\nwith regard to rules for conventional weapons, especially\r\nlight arms. Therefore, efforts to halt their proliferation must\r\nbe stepped up, both within conflicts themselves and where\r\nconflicts are rooted. As has been pointed out, these\r\nweapons are the cause of many violent deaths.\r\nMy delegation considers it necessary to make an\r\nimportant clarification regarding statements on the increase\r\nof human rights activities in field operations as a direct\r\nresult of decisions adopted by the Security Council in this\r\nfield.\r\nParagraph 31 of the Secretary-General’s report states\r\nthat operations of this nature exist in Colombia. On this\r\npoint, it must be made very clear that the opening of an\r\noffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights was never the result of a decision of the\r\nSecurity Council. On the contrary, it arose from a\r\nproposal made by the Colombian Government itself,\r\nwhich had the support and full welcome of the\r\nOrganization’s relevant human rights bodies, in particular\r\nthe Commission on Human Rights.\r\nThis is therefore not a matter of a decision imposed\r\nby the Security Council, but rather of an innovative\r\nprocedure to help in the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights in Colombia as a part of the resolute\r\ncommitment of the Colombian authorities to defend these\r\nrights.\r\nWe commend the efforts of the Organization with\r\nregard to the maintenance of peace.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General is a valuable\r\ndocument for Member States which summarizes the\r\nefforts, results and work left to be done by all.\r\nMr. Türk (Slovenia): We have studied the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\nwith keen interest. The report gives a concise overview of\r\nUnited Nations activities and offers a comprehensive\r\npicture of the current developments within the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe delegation of Slovenia commends the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the clarity and conciseness of the report, as\r\nwell as for its early availability. This helped focus the\r\ngeneral debate at the beginning of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Today we are required to concentrate\r\non those questions which need to be considered in order\r\nto help the progress of the current session and the taking\r\nof the necessary decisions.\r\nIn his general statement on the current situation of\r\nthe Organization and the Organization’s steps ahead, in\r\nparagraph 167, the Secretary-General expresses prudent\r\noptimism. We share this sentiment. The Organization is\r\ndoing useful work; it is active in the efforts to adjust and\r\nadapt to the changing international environment and is\r\ndemonstrating a real capacity for the necessary\r\ninnovation. Much of this is to the credit of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who has offered a number of specific and well\r\nthought out proposals for reform. Those proposals\r\nrepresent an important complement to the specific\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\ndecisions and actions of the Organization in its daily work\r\nand a valuable contribution to the Organization’s\r\ndynamism.\r\nOn the other hand, it has to be recognized that the\r\ncurrent situation of the United Nations, both its internal\r\nsituation and its role in the changing world, is far from\r\nwhat the majority of United Nations Members would\r\nconsider desirable, let alone perfect. The discrepancy\r\nbetween needs and expectations on the one hand, and the\r\nactual performance of the Organization on the other,\r\nundoubtedly exists. It is important that we understand the\r\nreasons for this discrepancy and equally important that we\r\ntry to make specific proposals which will diminish it.\r\nThere are, in our opinion, three basic reasons for the\r\ndifficulties which need to be addressed during the present\r\ndiscussion. They are, first, the extent of change in the\r\ninternational environment; secondly, the inherently\r\ndemanding character of the most important tasks of the\r\nUnited Nations; and thirdly, the less than perfect level of\r\ncooperation among the United Nations Member States.\r\nAllow me to briefly address those three sets of\r\nquestions and to start with a few words on the nature of the\r\nongoing change in the world.\r\nIn the first part of the report, the Secretary-General\r\ndescribes the “contours of the new era” and explains that\r\ntoday, as in all transitional periods, different expressions of\r\nthe human predicament coexist in an uneasy tension:\r\nglobalization and particularism, zones of prosperity and\r\nlarge pockets of poverty, areas of peace and areas of\r\nunprecedented violence. These circumstances have a\r\nprofound bearing on the tasks of the United Nations today.\r\nThe dissolution of the previous international order and\r\nsome aspects of the current processes of globalization have\r\ncontributed to the strengthening of the tendencies of social\r\nand political disintegration. As the Secretary-General\r\ncorrectly states in paragraph 16 of the report,\r\n“The same technological means that foster\r\nglobalization and the transnational expansion of civil\r\nsociety also provide the infrastructure for expanding\r\nglobal networks of ... organized crime, ... money\r\nlaunderers and terrorists.” [A/52/1, para. 16]\r\nIt can be added that the uneven character of global\r\neconomic progress resulted in the concentration of direct\r\nforeign investment in a small number of countries. Large\r\nparts of the world, notably Africa, are left out. Inadequate\r\neconomic progress is adding to political instability and to\r\nthe outbreak of armed conflicts.\r\nThese and other changes in the international\r\nenvironment represent a challenge to all international\r\norganizations, which have to adjust their activities and\r\nstructures to the new needs. If the United Nations is\r\ncompared with other international organizations in this\r\ncontext, it can be said that the United Nations efforts to\r\nadjust are among the most serious ones. Furthermore, it\r\nhas to be recognized that the United Nations is left with\r\nsome of the most difficult tasks. The expectations of the\r\ninternational community must be measured against a\r\nrealistic understanding of the real power of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe responsibilities placed on the United Nations in\r\nsuch areas as crisis management, development assistance,\r\nhuman rights and crime prevention are indeed weighty\r\nand, regrettably, often unaccompanied by the necessary\r\nassistance of States. Effective international cooperation\r\nrequires effective Member States. As pointed out in\r\nparagraph 10 of the report, an effective State is crucial for\r\nsuccess in development. We would add to this that an\r\neffective and enlightened role of the State is critical for\r\nthe international management of the global processes of\r\nchange. States must demonstrate, within the activities of\r\nthe United Nations, that they understand this requirement\r\nand that they are able to live up to it.\r\nLet me now proceed to my second set of remarks,\r\nconcerning the demanding character of some of the most\r\nimportant tasks of the United Nations today.\r\nAn enlightened and effective role of the State\r\nrequires that good governance, human rights and\r\ndemocratization are understood as fundamental tasks. We\r\nwelcome the placement of these tasks in the second part\r\nof the report and we largely agree with the content of the\r\nrelevant paragraphs, 22 to 41, of the report.\r\nThe current United Nations activities in the field of\r\nhuman rights confirm and emphasize the universality of\r\nhuman rights. Indeed, universality is the very essence of\r\nthe concept and of the legal definition of human rights.\r\nHowever, the notion of universality does not require\r\nuniformity in the implementation of the universally valid\r\nconcepts of human rights. In the implementation there has\r\nto be scope for specificity and a margin of appreciation in\r\ndevising the specific measures necessary for the effective\r\nimplementation of the universal norms of human rights.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nOn the other hand, universality requires that the United\r\nNations human rights agenda remain truly global. In this\r\ncontext, we agree with the Secretary-General, who\r\nemphasizes in his report such areas of work as United\r\nNations assistance for the strengthening of the judiciary\r\nworldwide and the need to combat discrimination against\r\nwomen and to eliminate violence against them. We would\r\nlike to add that combating racial discrimination must remain\r\namong the top priorities of the United Nations human rights\r\nagenda.\r\nFinally, the human rights activities of the United\r\nNations must be provided with more resources and become\r\nbetter integrated with the United Nations activities in the\r\ndomain of economic and social development.\r\nIn the sections of the report devoted to international\r\neconomic cooperation and sustainable development and to\r\ndevelopment operations, the Secretary-General provides an\r\noverview which shows the areas of progress as well as the\r\nproblems encountered. He rightly points to the unfavourable\r\ntrends in official development assistance which,\r\n“cast a serious shadow over the development prospects\r\nof lower income countries” [ibid., para. 47].\r\nThe negative trends with respect to official development\r\nassistance are among the factors which give rise to serious\r\nconcern.\r\nAnother reason for concern is the relatively slow\r\nprogress in the implementation of commitments agreed to\r\nat the World Summit for Social Development, held in\r\nCopenhagen in 1995. Both official development assistance\r\nand the implementation of commitments and specific targets\r\nin the field of social development require an effective and\r\nenlightened role of the State. Without the improved\r\nperformance of States, little can be expected to take place\r\nin the improvement of the situation in the least developed\r\ncountries or in the strengthening of world social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is important in this context to understand that the\r\nsuccess or failure of the United Nations development\r\nactivities hinges on the question of development in Africa.\r\nThere is no meaningful global development strategy without\r\na meaningful and effective strategy for development in\r\nAfrica. The initiatives to which the Secretary-General refers\r\nin paragraph 47 of his report are welcome and necessary.\r\nIf they succeed and a new partnership between developed\r\nand developing countries is established, then and only then\r\nwould we be in a position to say that the answer to the\r\nquestion of global development has been found.\r\nFurthermore, there is an urgent need to address the\r\nproblem of development as a factor among the sources of\r\nconflict in Africa and to lay the ground for a durable\r\npeace and economic growth in Africa, as requested by the\r\nSecurity Council at its ministerial meeting in September\r\nthis year. A prosperous and politically stable Africa will\r\ncontribute to global peace and security. We look forward\r\nto the relevant recommendations of the Secretary-General,\r\nwhich the Security Council requested from him.\r\nI wish to conclude with a few remarks regarding\r\ncooperation among States for an improved organization of\r\nthe United Nations. Here again the effectiveness and the\r\nenlightened character of States are put to the test. At\r\npresent this test consists of three clearly definable\r\nquestions: first, the question of the financing of the\r\nUnited Nations; secondly, the question of reforms\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General; and thirdly, the\r\nquestion of the most politically demanding reforms,\r\nincluding the reform of the Security Council.\r\nAn effective and responsible approach to the question\r\nof the financing of the United Nations — the first of the\r\nthree questions — requires that outstanding contributions\r\nby Member States be paid in full and that in future they\r\nbe paid in full and on time. Reaching agreement on the\r\nscale of assessments should not be allowed to become an\r\ninsurmountable problem.\r\nAs regards the agreement on the proposals for reform\r\nput forward by the Secretary-General, that should be seen\r\nas an opportunity to develop a new partnership among\r\nMember States for a better United Nations. For that to\r\nbecome possible, the narrow interests of individual States\r\nor groups of States should give way to the understanding\r\nof the common need and common purpose of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThirdly, such an understanding of the importance of\r\nthe majority of proposals for reform would represent\r\nsomething valuable per se and, not less importantly, a\r\ncondition which would enable the Organization to achieve\r\nsuccess in the most demanding aspects of reform,\r\nincluding the reform of the Security Council. While it is\r\nclear that the time for definitive decisions regarding the\r\nreform of the Security Council has not yet come and that\r\nresolutions which might imply the contrary should be\r\navoided, it also has become clear that immediate progress\r\nin matters of the financing of the United Nations and in\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nthe areas of reform proposed by the Secretary-General\r\nwould considerably improve the prospects for a meaningful\r\nreform of the Security Council. I think that this is one of\r\nthe most important matters to be kept in mind at the present\r\nstage of this session of the General Assembly.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that these are some\r\nthoughts which come to mind when studying the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization. The\r\ndiscussion of the report provides an opportunity for the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in the middle of the session, to take a\r\nlook at the state of the United Nations from a broader\r\nperspective and to enable itself to take the necessary\r\ndecisions. It is our hope that the current discussion will, in\r\nthat manner, contribute to the success of the reform efforts\r\nand help the General Assembly to take decisions where\r\ndecisions are needed.\r\nMr. Valle (Brazil): It is with particular satisfaction that\r\nI take the floor to welcome the first report on the work of\r\nthe Organization presented by Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan. We believe that this year’s annual report constitutes\r\na straightforward document which fulfils the goal of\r\nhighlighting the most significant aspects of the\r\nOrganization’s activity during the course of the previous\r\nyear in a refreshing and concise manner. We commend the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff for having provided us with\r\na sharply focused text that helps us to reflect on the\r\nchallenges that lie ahead, on the basis of recent experience.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s analysis of what he calls “the\r\ncontours of the new era” is a lucid attempt to capture in\r\nsuspended animation the essential elements of what\r\ncontinues to be a quickly shifting international environment,\r\nas regards both economic and political trends. It should not\r\ncome as a surprise that the picture which emerges is fraught\r\nwith contradictions. Unprecedented wealth and economic\r\ngrowth coexist with extreme forms of poverty. While\r\ndemocracy makes significant inroads, multiple forms of\r\ntyranny and intolerance continue to threaten individual\r\nfreedoms. Although the prospects for peace have seldom\r\nbeen more encouraging, a number of seemingly intractable\r\nconflicts continue to exclude various regions of the world\r\nfrom the more beneficial aspects of globalization.\r\nThe thematic overview of achievements in the main\r\nareas of activity over the past year in the report’s Chapter\r\nII brings to the forefront the fundamental topics of\r\ninternational economic cooperation and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We are pleased to note that the report has\r\nacknowledged the adoption of an Agenda for Development\r\nby the General Assembly as “a major event”. In our view,\r\nthe negotiations which led to its adoption represented a\r\ngroundbreaking exercise in helping to organize a\r\nconceptual framework for dealing with the complex\r\nrelationships among development, peace, democracy, good\r\ngovernance and human rights. Having overcome the\r\nideological confrontation of previous eras, we should\r\nexpect no less than a new consensus on economic\r\ndevelopment. We agree with the Secretary-General when\r\nhe states that\r\n“An important task ... for the years ahead will be to\r\ndevelop forms of partnership between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries — partnerships that meet the\r\nneeds and aspirations of developing countries and are\r\nalso consistent with global and economic conditions\r\nand attitudes.” [A/52/1, para. 47]\r\nThe work carried out by the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in\r\nexamining the relationship between globalization and\r\ndevelopment deserves to be highlighted in this context,\r\nand should continue to aim at promoting a fuller\r\nintegration of developing countries into the international\r\ntrading system, with the support of all Member States.\r\nFive years after the Rio Conference on Environment\r\nand Development, the special session of the General\r\nAssembly which took place last June has contributed to\r\nraising the level of awareness regarding the areas where\r\nprogress has been insufficient. The need for financial and\r\ntechnological support to developing countries in their\r\nefforts to pursue environmental goals remains a priority,\r\neven as cooperative strategies are sought in such key\r\nareas as climate change. This year’s report presents with\r\nparticular clarity the multifaceted and intersectoral nature\r\nof the concerns addressed both in the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment and at the special session of the General\r\nAssembly. Institutional improvements under way deserve\r\nthe political support of Member States so that current\r\nefforts at integrating the Organization’s analytical and\r\nnormative functions in the economic and social spheres\r\nmay help regional and national efforts to generate positive\r\nrepercussions worldwide.\r\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean mutually\r\nreinforcing prospects for economic growth and vigorous\r\ndemocracy have established a solid basis for trade-\r\ninduced integration, setting the stage for continuous peace\r\nand development. Such encouraging signs are visible in\r\nmany regions, and it is our belief that the United Nations\r\nhas greatly contributed to promoting such changes and\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\ncan do more in the years to come, with the active support\r\nof the international community.\r\nOf immediate relevance, of course, is the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security in those areas where it remains under threat.\r\nWhile not intending to present views on United Nations\r\nactivities with respect to specific conflicts, I would\r\nnevertheless like to make a few comments on the coverage\r\nof certain security issues in this year’s report.\r\nThe topic of sanctions is one which has generated\r\nconsiderable interest in recent years, as increasing resort to\r\nthis tool has underlined the need to limit its unintended\r\neffects and ensure it is properly targeted. While we agree\r\nthat sanctions can permit the United Nations “to bring\r\npressure to bear without recourse to force”, as stated in\r\nparagraph 89, we question the appropriateness of addressing\r\nthe issue in a subchapter entitled “Preventive diplomacy,\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament”. As stated\r\nin annex II of resolution 51/242, by which the General\r\nAssembly adopted the texts approved by the Informal\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Peace,\r\n“As Security Council action under Chapter VII,\r\nsanctions are a matter of utmost seriousness and\r\nconcern”. [resolution 51/242, annex II, para. 1]\r\nTo include sanctions in a section of the report which deals\r\nessentially with Chapter VI efforts seems to us misleading.\r\nThe following subchapter, dealing with humanitarian\r\naction, describes the growing interest and involvement of\r\nthe Security Council in humanitarian questions as a\r\nwelcome and timely development. This affirmation requires\r\nsome qualification. It would have been worth recalling, for\r\ninstance, that a presidential statement of the Security\r\nCouncil was issued, as document S/PRST/1997/34, on the\r\nquestion of “Protection for humanitarian assistance to\r\nrefugees and others in conflict situations”, which reflects\r\nthe sentiment of the Council on this question. Our own\r\nposition, as presented to the Council in the open debate that\r\ntook place on 21 May under the presidency of the Republic\r\nof Korea, can be summarized as follows: if the Security\r\nCouncil is to be expected to play a more active role in\r\nguaranteeing safe conditions for humanitarian assistance,\r\nour preference is for such endeavours to be attempted in\r\nparallel with multilaterally defined diplomatic agendas and\r\nwithin the realm of the possibilities offered by Chapter\r\nVI — that of the pacific settlement of disputes.\r\nFurthermore, it is necessary to preserve the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the humanitarian domain whenever\r\ninternational security is not the overriding concern. In\r\naddition, we must ensure adequate coordination between\r\nthe relevant United Nations bodies and other agencies, in\r\naccordance with the principles of humanity, neutrality and\r\nimpartiality of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe chapter on peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding refers to the phenomenon of what is coming to\r\nbe seen by some delegations as an exaggerated reluctance\r\non the part of the Security Council to contemplate the\r\ncreation of new peacekeeping operations. While not\r\ndefending a return to the patterns of 1993 and 1994, the\r\nreport seems to echo a widespread apprehension to the\r\neffect that errors can also be made in the opposite\r\ndirection. This is a question worth pondering.\r\nPeacekeeping operations remain an effective instrument\r\nfor the promotion of international peace when resorted to\r\nwith the necessary caution and given the appropriate\r\npolitical conditions. In the absence of such conditions,\r\nprecipitate action or misguided decisions can erode the\r\nOrganization’s credibility. As arrangements for standby\r\nreadiness are perfected and other organizational\r\nimprovements are conceived, it will be necessary to\r\nreflect on the possibilities and limitations of peacekeeping\r\nin the current international scene.\r\nWe have repeatedly stressed the significance of\r\npeace-building efforts for the consolidation of peace. But\r\nit might be useful, from a conceptual point of view and\r\nin terms of presentation as well, to differentiate between\r\nreconstruction or technical assistance carried out with the\r\nconsent of the parties on the one hand, and activities\r\ncarried out under Chapter VII, such as those of the United\r\nNations Special Commission or of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for\r\nRwanda, on the other. To discuss the latter and the former\r\nas part of a continuum, as is the case in the report,\r\nglosses over the fundamental difference in the nature of\r\nwhat is being attempted in each case and tends to\r\nminimize the seriousness of those exceptional\r\ncircumstances required for the authorization of\r\nenforcement measures.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report is correct in stressing\r\nmultilateralism: an opportunity, in short, for peace and\r\nsustainable development. As we prepare ourselves to\r\nmanage a changing international environment, we must\r\nconfront the need for renewal and reform. We therefore\r\ntake the occasion offered by the democratic debate on the\r\nannual report on the work of the Organization to welcome\r\nonce again the many constructive proposals for reform\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General, and to reaffirm our\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nreadiness to promote the necessary degree of agreement on\r\nthe reform of other vital areas of the United Nations in\r\norder to fully equip the Organization to play its part in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThrough you, Sir, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis thought-provoking report on the work of the United\r\nNations during the fifty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly. It is thought-provoking because rather than\r\nconfining itself to a list of facts it describes the forces that\r\nhave transformed the world since the cold war, the way in\r\nwhich the United Nations has reacted, and the ways and\r\nmeans of successfully confronting the new realities.\r\nWe share the basic premise that we live in a world of\r\ncontradictions: integration and globalization coexist with\r\nfragmentation and marginalization; computer science, while\r\na source of progress, is also facilitating the expansion of\r\ntransnational criminal networks, drug trafficking, money\r\nlaundering and terrorism; greater awareness of\r\nenvironmental problems is not accompanied by the political\r\nwill to find satisfactory solutions; and despite the\r\nstrengthening of democracy, extremely serious violations of\r\nhuman rights continue to be committed.\r\nThe Secretary-General has given us his response to\r\nthese dualities: that these problems cannot be resolved in\r\nisolation, but need to be approached in a comprehensive\r\nway, combining the essential element of peace and security\r\nwith sustainable development, democracy and good\r\ngovernance. The United Nations must therefore undertake\r\nthe reforms necessary for an integrated approach to be\r\nreflected in its actions.\r\nIt is from that viewpoint that we wish to comment on\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General. We shall focus on tasks\r\nin three areas: sustainable development, the protection of\r\nhuman rights, and the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn a world characterized by major disparities in income\r\nand in access to services and opportunities, we value the\r\nefforts of United Nations funds and programmes to\r\neradicate poverty and promote sustainable human\r\ndevelopment. The resources available to those funds and\r\nprogrammes are, however, limited. One of the paradoxes of\r\nour day is the reduction in official development assistance.\r\nThe situation requires, first and foremost, that resources be\r\ncarefully managed so that they will be allocated to those\r\nreally in need. It also requires thought on the role to be\r\nplayed by the United Nations in this area, and particularly\r\nvis-à-vis other development agencies that have greater\r\nresources. The Secretary-General is aware of this\r\nsituation, and proposes solutions in paragraphs 77 and 174\r\nof the report. Argentina supports these efforts aimed at\r\nimproving the cost-benefit ratio of these activities.\r\nWe particularly agree with the Secretary-General\r\nthat good governance is an essential requirement for\r\nsustainable development. We are pleased that the United\r\nNations Development Programme allocates some of its\r\nresources to this field.\r\nSustainable development also requires that the needs\r\nof the world population be met without affecting the\r\nenvironment. Expectations regarding the nineteenth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, on the review of\r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21, were not entirely met.\r\nNonetheless, that conference made it possible for us to be\r\naware of the scant progress achieved in the fulfilment of\r\nthe commitments undertaken in Rio de Janeiro. This fact,\r\ntogether with the active role played by non-governmental\r\norganizations, should encourage us to persevere in our\r\nefforts.\r\nIn the post-cold-war world, the protection of human\r\nrights is an element that is inseparably linked to\r\ninternational peace and security. We agree with the\r\nSecretary-General about the importance of incorporating\r\nthe promotion of human rights into peacekeeping\r\noperations. A lasting peace can be built only on the basis\r\nof democratic regimes. In this context, we attach great\r\nimportance to the monitoring of electoral processes under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations. The best evidence of\r\nthe value that States attach to the legitimacy of\r\ndemocratic processes is reflected, as the Secretary-General\r\ntells us, by the fact that in the past five years the United\r\nNations has received some 80 requests for electoral\r\nassistance. Argentina has cooperated and will continue to\r\ncooperate enthusiastically in these missions and in other\r\ntasks in support of the establishment and consolidation of\r\ndemocratic systems.\r\nThe maintenance of peace and security is the\r\nfundamental and irreplaceable role of the United Nations.\r\nIf that role is not ensured, no other activity can be\r\nconducted effectively. All countries, regardless of their\r\nsize and to the extent of their capacities, should feel\r\nthemselves to be participants in the effort to maintain\r\npeace and security.\r\nArgentina is gratified by the fact that for 40 years\r\nnow it has contributed to peacekeeping operations and\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nthat it has participated in over half of them. In this context,\r\nwe believe it is very important that the mandates that the\r\nSecurity Council gives to these operations be as clear and\r\nprecise as possible. But in order to have mandates that meet\r\nthese conditions, it is necessary first of all to grasp the\r\nprofound change that has taken place in the nature of\r\nconflicts. Today these are, for the most part, intra-State\r\nconflicts, and they are accompanied by grave humanitarian\r\nsituations.\r\nSecondly, these new conflicts require greater sensitivity\r\non the part of the Security Council. That sensitivity can be\r\nproduced only through a more profound and direct\r\nknowledge of the realities in the countries affected and of\r\nthe overall circumstances prevailing in the regions where\r\nthe conflicts occur. These comments apply in particular to\r\nthe subject of sanctions and their negative impact on\r\ncivilian populations. All this needs to be studied, as is\r\npointed out by the Secretary-General.\r\nWhat is needed, therefore, is greater transparency,\r\nmore fluid relations with the General Assembly, continuing\r\ndialogue with all countries concerned and, where required,\r\na role for non-governmental organizations whose experience\r\nmay be useful. Combining effectiveness in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council with transparency in its procedures should\r\nnot be difficult at a time when democracy is spreading in\r\nalmost all countries. We believe that only in this way will\r\nwe be able to implement the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nWe are also of the opinion that in the future the\r\nOrganization should apply the lessons learned in joint\r\ndeployment with regional organizations and that it should\r\nexplore the possibilities of renewed use of Chapter VIII of\r\nthe Charter.\r\nIn a different context, as was recently stated by\r\nForeign Minister Di Tella before this Assembly:\r\n“A lasting peace requires United Nations\r\ncontingents endowed with the capacity to deploy\r\nrapidly and effectively.” [Official Records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 10th meeting, p. 15]\r\nI wish to recall that Argentina supports initiatives to\r\nimprove the deployment time of troops, is a party to the\r\nstand-by force agreements and has joined the Danish Stand-\r\nby Forces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG) initiative.\r\nAs a complement to peacekeeping operations, we\r\nhave conflict-prevention and peace-building activities. In\r\nconnection with the former, without impinging on\r\nsensitive matters of States, the United Nations should\r\nstrengthen a system of early warning. As regards the\r\nlatter, the cessation of armed conflict is a necessary\r\ncondition, but is not enough for the establishment of a\r\njust and lasting peace.\r\nIn this context, I wish to mention the “White\r\nHelmets”. The relevance that this body has acquired\r\nreflects the tasks it has carried out and the greater\r\nawareness of countries regarding the importance of acting\r\nin rapid and integral fashion. The new missions that the\r\n“White Helmets” have begun to carry out in Angola, Haiti\r\nand Palestine encourage us to call for the international\r\ncommunity to participate actively in this initiative.\r\nIn respect of disarmament, relevant steps have been\r\ntaken. We would like to highlight the signing of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the entry into\r\nforce of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, efforts to\r\nprovide the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nDevelopment, Production and Stockpiling of\r\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\r\nTheir Destruction with an effective verification\r\nmechanism, and progress in the area of nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones.\r\nNow of concern is the proliferation of small and light\r\narms, because their dissemination heightens intra-State\r\nconflict. Furthermore, there should be an institutional link\r\ndrawn between questions of peace and security and\r\ndisarmament issues in order to fulfil the essential role of\r\nthe United Nations more effectively.\r\nWe particularly value the support given by the\r\nSecretary-General to the Ottawa process. Argentina will\r\nsign the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction next December, and will\r\ncontinue to work for total prohibition.\r\nThis is the first report of the current Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization. It reflects the\r\nvision of a statesman. It transmits the experience acquired\r\nin the Secretariat, where there are so many examples of\r\nselfless dedication to the cause of peace. We are\r\nconvinced that the reforms proposed, which we will\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nsteadily be implementing on the basis of consensus, will\r\ndirect the Organization towards the twenty-first century.\r\nMr. Reyn (Belgium) (interpretation from French): I\r\nwould like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his\r\nefforts in preparing and presenting a month and a half ago\r\nthe report we are considering today in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nEveryone will agree that this document is of\r\nindisputable interest. The description of the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations make it possible to better assess the place\r\nand the activities of our Organization in the context of the\r\ngreat changes in the world. Furthermore, the report gives\r\nthe Secretary-General the opportunity to introduce the\r\nmeans for restoring dynamism to the United Nations, the\r\ndynamism that world public opinion expects of it.\r\nThe concise drafting of the report and its presentation\r\nby the Secretary-General in person at the beginning of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly contributed to making the\r\nministerial debate more specific. That was a successful\r\ninnovation, and my delegation thanks those who made it\r\npossible.\r\nIn my opinion, the most important message of the\r\nreport remains the acknowledgement that the new global\r\nenvironment demands far-reaching adaptation by the United\r\nNations, as well as the fact that the Secretary-General is\r\nfully prepared to work vigorously along those lines.\r\nAs the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs stated\r\nhere,\r\n“It is clear that the way in which we organize\r\nourselves as a world community is of the utmost\r\nimportance for questions of war and peace, poverty\r\nand wealth, and justice and injustice in the world”\r\n[Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-\r\nsecond Session, Plenary Meetings, 12th meeting, p. 29]\r\nMy delegation fully supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nintention to transform the United Nations into an\r\nOrganization that is simpler, more integrated and more\r\nfocused, one that is capable of carrying out its mission in\r\nits different fields with maximum synergy and\r\neffectiveness.\r\nThe reform proposals are even more deserving of our\r\nsupport, as they are part of a restructuring initiative that is\r\nsufficiently global, aimed at adapting the entire\r\nOrganization to the requirements of the modern world. Such\r\na process calls for the resolute commitment of all\r\nMember States and deserves a rapid and unequivocal\r\ncollective response.\r\nOn the basis of such a positive response we will be\r\nable to give greater dynamism to the relationships\r\nbetween the principal intergovernmental bodies: the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. It is also on the basis of\r\nthat response that a better balance should be found among\r\nthose bodies. And it is on the basis of that response that\r\nwe will be able better to develop the essential links\r\nbetween the political tasks and the development work of\r\nthe United Nations and to design the global role of an\r\nOrganization whose central elements are progress in\r\nrespect for human rights and in respect for international\r\nlaw.\r\nSeveral other aspects of the report also deserve to be\r\nhighlighted. First, as the Secretary-General notes, the new\r\nworld environment demands more systematic cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and all the other actors that\r\nare working to promote political and economic security at\r\nall levels, whether they are regional organizations or even\r\nnon-State actors.\r\nThe Secretary-General also emphasizes the extreme\r\ngravity of the financial situation of the United Nations.\r\nBelgium agrees that any reform effort will be in vain if\r\nthe fundamental need to give the Organization a more\r\nappropriate and reliable financial basis is neglected. It is\r\nhigh time to stop the use of interim measures in both the\r\nmanagement of the Organization and the search for\r\nlasting solutions.\r\nFinally, the reform of the Security Council is another\r\nof those exercises demanded by the overall reform of this\r\nOrganization. This delicate matter must be judged on its\r\nown merits; we should avoid both unproductive\r\nconfrontation and the definitive deferment of this\r\nfundamental aspect of reform.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General deals with a\r\ngreat many other issues that I have not addressed. I\r\nwished simply to highlight those that seemed to me\r\nessential; that, however, does not in any way diminish the\r\nimportance of the other aspects of the report. The report\r\nprovides a very useful framework for action by the\r\nOrganization and the work of this session of our\r\nAssembly. I should again like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and I hope that he will follow the same approach\r\nnext year in presenting his report.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): My delegation continues to\r\nmaintain that the debate pertaining to the item under current\r\nconsideration, agenda item 10, entitled “Report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization”, should,\r\nas in the past, remain an item of priority deliberation. We\r\nbelieve that this item deserves to be considered early during\r\nthe work of the General Assembly to signify the importance\r\nof this report. After all, it is one of the Charter-mandated\r\nreports, constituting an important and integral element of\r\nthe work of the General Assembly, as stipulated in Article\r\n98 of the Charter.\r\nMr. Zacharakis (Greece), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe wish to commend the Secretary-General for his\r\nmaiden annual report, which has been submitted in a\r\nconcise and refreshingly readable form. It is our hope that\r\nthis reporting format will be retained and that the\r\ntemptation for lengthy annual reports in future will be\r\nresisted. We readily agree that in considering this year’s\r\nreport, due account needs to be taken of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform proposals contained in the relevant\r\ndocuments and of his oral statement at the beginning of this\r\nsession.\r\nWhile my delegation welcomes the format of the\r\nreport, containing three chapters and eight sub-chapters, we\r\nwould like to suggest that the report continue to contain the\r\ndata pertaining to the resolutions adopted by the General\r\nAssembly. It should be recalled that last year many\r\ndelegations requested that future annual reports include\r\ninformation on the status of the implementation of\r\nresolutions and decisions, as they form the basis of the\r\nintergovernmental mandate to the Secretariat for action. My\r\ndelegation would in particular like to be apprised of\r\nproblems at the implementation stage so as to enable the\r\nintergovernmental process to review and re-evaluate the\r\ndecisions it had taken.\r\nIn outlining the “Contours of the new era” in the first\r\nchapter, the United Nations Secretary-General has outlined\r\nseven fundamental forces “reshaping the world today”\r\n[A/52/1, para. 6]. He has rightly focused on globalization\r\nas one of these forces. In paragraphs 6 to 11 he has\r\nsuccinctly highlighted the benefits and challenges of\r\nglobalization. I wish in particular to refer to paragraph 8,\r\nwhich reads,\r\n“Globalization also poses numerous policy\r\nchallenges, however. Among them are the inherent\r\nrisks of markets lacking critical regulatory safeguards,\r\nas is true in some respects of international financial\r\nmarkets. Globalization is also eroding the efficacy of\r\nsome policy instruments by which the industrialized\r\ncountries had pursued full employment and social\r\nstability throughout the era that followed the Second\r\nWorld War.” [Ibid., para. 8]\r\nFor the East Asian region, which has been subjected\r\nto extreme volatility of currency and stock markets, the\r\nurgent need for critical regulatory safeguards in respect of\r\ninternational financial markets is unambiguous. The\r\nUnited Nations should contribute to the international\r\nefforts to arrive at critical regulatory safeguards.\r\nOn the issue of international economic cooperation,\r\nsustained economic growth and sustainable development,\r\nwe note the Secretary-General’s assurances that this issue\r\nwill remain at the core of the Organization’s agenda.\r\nNevertheless, the critical challenge is to operationalize the\r\ncollective commitments made at the United Nations and\r\nat the various global conferences, particularly the financial\r\ncommitments. We must arrest the accelerating slide\r\ntowards a diminishing role for the United Nations on\r\ndevelopment issues, especially on issues of trade and\r\ndevelopment financing. While good governance at the\r\nnational level is critical, we cannot ignore or sideline the\r\nimportance of a supportive international environment. It\r\nmay be timely to seriously consider the need for the\r\nSecretary-General to attend the key and annual meetings\r\nof the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that democracy\r\nat the national level should continue to be promoted and\r\nexpanded. However, it is disquieting that the report is\r\nsilent on the important principle of democracy among\r\nnations, which should be promoted by our Organization\r\non the basis of the principle of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates.\r\nIn respect of human rights, my delegation takes note\r\nof the Secretary-General’s assessment as contained in the\r\nreport. While the core human rights activities of the\r\nUnited Nations had taken on renewed strength after the\r\n1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, as\r\nthe Secretary-General correctly observed, progress in the\r\nimplementation of the right to development, which is\r\nrecognized by the Declaration as indivisible and an\r\nintegral part of human rights is far from satisfactory.\r\nThere are still many obstacles, especially at the\r\ninternational level, which have impeded, and can impede,\r\nits full realization. It is therefore critical for the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\ninternational community to inject renewed interest and a\r\nspirit of cooperation in overcoming these obstacles.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation would also like to\r\nemphasize the need for all countries, regardless of their\r\nlevel of economic development, to expand, enhance and\r\ncontribute to the exchange of knowledge and experiences in\r\nthe field of human rights. We have much to learn from\r\neach other. It is our view that the Secretary-General and,\r\nespecially, the High Commissioner for Human Rights have\r\nan important role to play in promoting this spirit of\r\ncooperation and should not be perceived as promoting the\r\ninterests of certain groups. My delegation also believes that\r\nthe establishment of a separate new branch with\r\ncommensurate levels of services and resources to deal\r\nspecifically with the right to development is necessary\r\nunder the proposed consolidation of the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human\r\nRights.\r\nNext year, 1998, will mark the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It will also be\r\nfive years since the adoption of the Vienna Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action. This is indeed an opportune time to\r\ntake stock of the substantial progress made in the field of\r\nhuman rights. We must reject the exploitation of human\r\nrights for self-serving reasons, evident in the double\r\nstandards and selectivity which have characterized the\r\nannual meetings of the Commission on Human Rights. At\r\nthe same time, there should also be greater candour and\r\nhonesty about our failures, which have indeed been\r\nconsiderable, as attested to by the mounds of human\r\nremains and pools of blood we have witnessed on our\r\ntelevision screens and documented in various reports which\r\nwill haunt us all for ever as human beings.\r\nOn the question of disarmament, my delegation has\r\nalways believed that the Organization could fully exercise\r\nits potential to play a more significant and prominent role.\r\nThis role could be built upon the existing multilateral\r\ndisarmament treaties and conventions, as well as through\r\nclose cooperation with regional organizations. However, in\r\nspite of some positive developments in the area of arms\r\nregulation and disarmament in the past year, we cannot be\r\ntoo sanguine about these achievements in the absence of\r\nany real or substantial progress made in the area of the\r\nfurther reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total\r\nelimination. The failure of the Conference on Disarmament\r\nto make further progress at its 1997 session is clear\r\ntestimony to this. Despite numerous calls by the\r\ninternational community, the threat posed by the continued\r\nexistence of nuclear weapons persists, hovering like the\r\nproverbial sword of Damocles over mankind.\r\nMy delegation shares the concern over the increasing\r\nthreat of illicit transfers of small arms and light weapons,\r\nespecially to conflict areas. Effective steps should be\r\ntaken to address this issue from the core — that is, to\r\nlimit the production and acquisitions of such weapons\r\nonly to the legitimate security requirements of States.\r\nSimilarly, greater attention should be given to the\r\nincreasing availability of more technologically advanced\r\nand sophisticated conventional weapons. The drive for\r\nhigher profits derived from the supply of those weapons,\r\nparticularly to the developing countries, has threatened\r\nregional security and hampered confidence-building\r\nefforts. In this regard, we would welcome any effort to\r\nstrengthen and broaden the scope of the United Nations\r\nRegister of Conventional Arms, as we believe it would\r\ncontribute to enhancing transparency.\r\nAs events in many parts of the world have continued\r\nto demonstrate, the role of the United Nations in\r\npeacekeeping in all its aspects is critical to the promotion\r\nof peace and development. We fully concur with the\r\nobservation in the report that,\r\n“Though peace is far less costly than war, there\r\nshould be no illusion that it can be achieved on the\r\ncheap.” [A/52/1, para. 110]\r\nOn the question of preventive diplomacy and\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, my delegation would like\r\nto reiterate the necessity that such activities continue to be\r\nundertaken within the provisions of the United Nations\r\nCharter and the mandate given to the world body. My\r\ndelegation also welcomes the adoption of General\r\nAssembly resolution 51/242 regarding the\r\nrecommendation concerning the Informal Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on An Agenda for Peace. It is\r\nunfortunate, however, that the General Assembly is\r\nunable, as yet, to successfully conclude the work of the\r\nsubgroups on preventive diplomacy and peacemaking and\r\npost-conflict peace-building, signalling the inability of\r\nMember States to move ahead on critical issues relevant\r\nto many of the affected States.\r\nAlthough supportive of United Nations efforts aimed\r\nat preventing conflicts or the escalation of conflicts, my\r\ndelegation is concerned about the indiscriminate use of\r\nthe term “preventive action” appearing in a number of\r\nUnited Nations publications, including the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on a programme for reform contained\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nin document A/51/950. The concept clearly requires further\r\nclarification and certainly deliberated upon by the General\r\nAssembly. At the same time, my delegation shares the view\r\nthat Member States must come to grips with the real\r\nproblems on the ground, while maintaining the fundamental\r\nprinciples of inter-State relations as enshrined in the\r\nCharter.\r\nMy delegation expresses its serious concern at the\r\nincreasing number of attacks on humanitarian personnel and\r\nthe numerous barriers placed in the way of their access to\r\npopulations in distress. Any attack on humanitarian action\r\nnegates the very foundations of assistance and protection\r\nwork. This growing problem calls for a more\r\ncomprehensive and concerted international response and\r\nassistance.\r\nOn the issue of transnational threats, Malaysia shares\r\nthe concern over the exploitation of modern technology by\r\n“uncivil society” to enhance their illegal activities. This\r\ntransboundary nature of current criminal activities indeed\r\nposes a serious threat to the well-being of the international\r\ncommunity, both the Member States and the peoples of the\r\nworld. In this regard, my delegation welcomes all efforts to\r\nenhance international cooperation against transnational\r\nthreats, including addressing the drug menace.\r\nI cannot conclude my statement without reference to\r\nthe precarious financial health of the Organization. As of 30\r\nSeptember 1997, the Organization was owed $2.417 billion\r\nfor the regular budget, peacekeeping budget and the budgets\r\nfor the international tribunals. It is regrettable that the major\r\ncontributor accounted for 60 per cent of all amounts owed\r\nto the Organization. Failure to pay or withholding\r\nmandatory contributions constitutes a direct attack on\r\nUnited Nations programmes and action. It is unfortunate\r\nthat as a result of late payments or non-payment, the United\r\nNations had to resort to borrowing from the already\r\ndepleted peacekeeping account to cover the shortfall.\r\nMalaysia and many others, despite being up to date in their\r\nassessed contributions, have in fact been penalized by not\r\nbeing reimbursed for providing troops and equipment to the\r\nvarious United Nations peacekeeping operations. We\r\ntherefore appeal to all Member States to fulfil in good faith\r\ntheir mandatory contributions to the United Nations in full,\r\non time and without conditions.\r\nMrs. Cornette (Guyana): My delegation wishes to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his concise report on the\r\nwork of the United Nations over the past year. Certainly, it\r\nmakes us more aware of how global events, particularly in\r\nthe developing countries, have had an impact on us. We can\r\nreflect on those activities which took place at the United\r\nNations over the past year so that, in the reform process\r\nin which we are now engaged, we can seek to make the\r\nOrganization more capable of dealing with these changes.\r\nGuyana shares the concerns of all the Member States\r\nthat are concerned with the problems that have surfaced\r\nin the globalization process. We are pleased to note that\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment has been examining the relationships\r\nbetween globalization and development and that the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean has been examining the compatibility between\r\ninternational trade and a more open international system.\r\nWe hope that these findings will be made available for\r\nreview by the General Assembly.\r\nWith the trend towards globalization, developing\r\ncountries are in danger of having the gains they have\r\nmade in areas such as trade negated. This comes at a time\r\nwhen we are still grappling with the poverty issue and\r\nmeans of resolving it. It would be wise, therefore, to pay\r\nparticular attention to the 1997 World Economic and\r\nSocial Survey, which concludes that less affluent countries\r\nrequire a more favourable external economic environment\r\nthan currently exists.\r\nAll States have recognized the need for partnership\r\nfor development. It is only through partnership with\r\ndeveloped countries, and with the United Nations, that\r\ndeveloping countries will be able to improve their\r\neconomic situation. All actors involved must recognize\r\nthe special challenges faced by developing counties and\r\nwork together towards resolving them. By doing so, it is\r\npossible for the world to reach the goal of peace and\r\nstability worldwide. The universal institution of the\r\nUnited Nations is most suited to the task of fostering such\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nInternal strife has exacerbated the poverty issue in\r\nmany developing countries, which at this time also have\r\nto contend with the effects of globalization. The decision\r\nof the United Nations to strengthen its global watch so\r\nthat threats to international peace and security might be\r\ndetected early, and dealt with, would help Member States\r\nto devote greater efforts to dealing with other challenges.\r\nA few external conflicts still remain unresolved. In\r\nwhat remains one of the most troubled areas, the Middle\r\nEast, the fact that the tenth emergency special session of\r\nthe General Assembly is being convened for the third\r\ntime with the aim of resolving some of the issues in the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict indicates that the situation\r\nremains volatile. We hope that in the coming year greater\r\neffort will be devoted to working with the parties concerned\r\nin the Middle East and elsewhere so that differences can be\r\nresolved.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment has succeeded in integrating matters of an\r\neconomic, social and environmental nature with the aim of\r\nachieving sustainable development. One of the major events\r\nthis year was its five-year review. The finding that the state\r\nof the environment continues to deteriorate does not augur\r\nwell for developing countries whose economic viability is\r\nheavily reliant on a healthy physical environment. Now that\r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development is in a better\r\nposition to identify priorities, we hope that developing\r\ncountries will be able to benefit from the assistance\r\nnecessary to enable them to respond better to the more\r\npressing issues hampering their sustainable development\r\ngoals.\r\nDeveloping countries need to be better prepared to\r\ncope with the challenges which a changing world\r\nenvironment presents, while simultaneously adopting\r\neffective measures to address internal issues which hamper\r\nsustainable development. The Secretary-General’s reform\r\nproposals, when adopted, should better enable the United\r\nNations to assist developing countries in attaining their\r\npriority goals.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report observes, adequate\r\nfinancing is essential for implementing United Nations\r\nprogrammes and activities. Private capital flows have been\r\nselective and promises of official development assistance\r\nhave not been realized. United Nations funds and\r\nprogrammes have become the most reliable source of\r\nfunding. The United Nations has yet to find satisfactory\r\nsolutions to the question of financing. We hope, therefore,\r\nthat in the future, the United Nations will give this the\r\npriority consideration it deserves.\r\nOverall, this first report of the new Secretary-General\r\nhas assured us that the Organization is in capable hands.\r\nWe share its prudent optimism and are willing to work with\r\nhim to make the United Nations better able to serve its\r\nMember States.\r\nMr. Takht-Ravanchi (Islamic Republic of Iran): At\r\nthe very outset, let me express, on behalf of the delegation\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran, our gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, as contained in document A/52/1. We find\r\nthe report informative, analytical and useful.\r\nIn the introductory part of the report, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral provides a panoramic view of the most\r\nsignificant changes that have shaped world affairs in the\r\ncourse of the past decade and still continue to unfold, the\r\ncollapse of the bipolar world and ascendancy of the twin\r\nprocesses of globalization and liberalization being the two\r\nmost fundamental factors. The report’s treatment of the\r\nfar-reaching implications of the ongoing transformations\r\nand further unfolding changes, particularly for the\r\ndeveloping world and the additional challenges they have\r\nto face, is also interesting.\r\nWe agree with the overall objectives enumerated in\r\nparagraph 2 of the report and believe that the whole\r\ninternational community should strive towards a more\r\nsecure and predictable peace, greater economic well-\r\nbeing, social justice and environmental sustainability.\r\nFurthermore, we concur with the view that individual\r\nnations can hardly achieve these lofty objectives on their\r\nown and, hence, we recognize the desirability as much as\r\nthe inevitability of collective efforts at the global level,\r\nwhich in our time are best embodied in the form of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nCognizant of the magnitude of the changes just\r\nreferred to, as well as of the imperative of reform and\r\nadaptation, we wish the Secretary-General the utmost\r\nsuccess in achieving greater unity of purpose, coherence\r\nof efforts and responsiveness throughout the United\r\nNations to meet the challenges of our time effectively.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s hope that the\r\nOrganization will remain a vital and effective instrument\r\nof international cooperation in the years and decades to\r\ncome.\r\nHaving made these general comments by way of\r\nintroduction, I would like to make a number of\r\nobservations on some aspects of the Organization’s work,\r\nespecially in the light of the still ongoing reform process.\r\nI underline, however, that as our views on various\r\nelements of the Secretary-General’s reform proposals\r\nhave been raised, in detail, in the course of current\r\ndeliberations on reform within the framework of the\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultations of the Plenary, our\r\nexposé here will be limited merely to a few select areas.\r\nFirst I turn to disarmament. We believe that\r\ndisarmament, as a top priority on the United Nations\r\nagenda, should preserve its significance and relevance to\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\ninternational peace and security. We concur with the\r\nSecretary-General that, in the past year, significant progress\r\nhas been made in the field of disarmament and arms\r\nregulation through multilateral treaty-making, in particular\r\nby the Conference on Disarmament. Nevertheless, we do\r\nnot share the optimism that the accomplishments thus far\r\nare of a comprehensive nature, unless and until nuclear\r\ndisarmament becomes a reality. Moreover, the imperative\r\nof nuclear disarmament should under no circumstances be\r\novershadowed by the ongoing negotiations and deliberations\r\non conventional weapons. Accordingly, it is our earnest\r\nhope that in the process of the United Nations reform and\r\nrestructuring of the disarmament (SSOD I) machinery, the\r\npriorities stipulated in the first special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly devoted to disarmament be given due\r\nconsideration and maintained.\r\nThe second issue I address concerns peacekeeping and\r\npost-conflict peace-building. In our view, the General\r\nAssembly, as the only truly universal body of the United\r\nNations, should exercise its paramount role in defining the\r\nobjectives and criteria as well as setting the requisite\r\nmodalities and guidelines for post-conflict peace-building\r\nactivities. Likewise, any proposals and measures to enhance\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping capabilities should receive\r\nsimilar treatment. Having thoroughly studied the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s analysis of past peacekeeping operations and their\r\nspecific difficulties, we are of the view that the success of\r\npeacekeeping operations in the future hinges upon genuine\r\nmultilateral cooperation and compliance with the principles\r\nof international law, in particular the provisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Similarly, the post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding activities to be undertaken by the United Nations\r\nshould also conform to the political, social, economic and\r\ncultural systems of the parties concerned.\r\nIn turning to the next issue, let me echo the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s emphasis on the importance of the question of\r\nhuman rights. The collective campaign of the world\r\ncommunity to define, promote and protect human rights\r\nacross the globe represents a great achievement of humanity\r\nat large and needs to be cherished by all; however, the\r\nimperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human\r\nrights, whether civil, political, economic, social or cultural,\r\nshould not be theoretically underestimated or practically\r\nneglected. We join the Secretary-General in welcoming the\r\nnew United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nand wish her the utmost success in this very sensitive area\r\nof global concern and international cooperation, in which\r\ndue attention and consideration must be paid to the specific\r\nparticularities of all societies.\r\nThe last issue I take up concerns development, which\r\nin our view should be considered the most pivotal, all-\r\nembracing and cross-cutting issue on the United Nations\r\nagenda. The serious implications and consequences of\r\nrecent fundamental transformations in world affairs,\r\nparticularly those of the twin processes of liberalization\r\nand globalization, further accentuate the imperative of\r\ndevelopment in its broadest sense for the larger segment\r\nof the world community. Despite this importance, which\r\nis also discernible in large measure in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, a number of disquieting trends need to\r\nbe addressed and adequately dealt with at the level of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe quite perceptible, albeit gradual, shift away from\r\nmultilateralism on the part of the developed world augurs\r\nill in this field. The continuing decline in official\r\ndevelopment assistance, coupled with a simultaneous\r\ngrowing reliance on bilateral and direct foreign\r\ninvestment, serve as unmistakable indications of this\r\nunhealthy process. Undue emphasis on just a few purely\r\nenvironmental aspects of sustainable development to the\r\ndetriment of the social and economic dimensions of\r\nbalanced overall development is another negative\r\nindication in this regard. We continue to believe that\r\ncomprehensive development of the South is the\r\nprerequisite for peace and security at the global level and\r\ndeserves to receive the undivided attention of the entire\r\ninternational community, including, in particular, the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Organization’s unrivalled role in the field of\r\ndevelopment, whether analytical, normative or operational,\r\nand in contributing to the creation of a favourable\r\ninternational milieu for development, hardly needs to be\r\nemphasized. Nor does the Secretary-General need to be\r\nconvinced of the centrality of development in the overall\r\nwork of the Organization. What remains is the United\r\nNations active involvement in the process of development,\r\ninter alia through full and expeditious implementation of\r\nthe Agenda for Development.\r\nTo conclude, let me add that the great challenge of\r\nour time lies in our ability to navigate through the\r\nuncharted contours of a new era. All countries, big and\r\nsmall, developed and developing, are facing this\r\nchallenge, although to varying degrees and in various\r\nways and fields. Moreover, it is not just individual\r\ncountries but the international community in its entirety\r\nthat is confronted with this daunting challenge. We all\r\nhave no choice but to take on the challenge and go\r\nforward. I further venture to add that we have no choice\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nbut to cooperate and strive collectively towards solving the\r\ncommon problems of humanity.\r\nMrs. Sinha (India): Permit me to begin by\r\ncomplimenting you, Sir, on the skill with which you have\r\nconducted the work of the fifty-second session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I would also like to compliment the\r\nSecretary-General on the quality of his report on the work\r\nof the Organization, which we are discussing today. The\r\nSecretary-General has set the tone for our discussions in the\r\nadmirable brevity and clarity of his comprehensive\r\ncoverage of the current challenges facing the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Secretary-General has said that we live in an era\r\nof realignment. Indeed, vast forces are at work reshaping\r\nthe world, but we do not want the process of globalization\r\nto be uncontrolled, nor would we welcome a return either\r\nto the international anarchy that preceded the creation of the\r\nUnited Nations or to the alignment and confrontation\r\nbetween blocs that vitiated international relations during the\r\ncold war. This is why, particularly in an era of realignment,\r\nthe principles and ideals of non-alignment continue to be so\r\nimportant. And this is also why we think that all Member\r\nStates must work together to strengthen the United Nations,\r\nmake its functioning more democratic and representative,\r\nand ensure that, through it, we are able to harness to the\r\ncommon good the forces and energies released by the end\r\nof the cold war and the inexorable progress of\r\nglobalization.\r\nIt is only the United Nations that can evolve, define\r\nand promote a comprehensive and responsive universalist\r\nagenda that will meet the challenges of the next century.\r\nThe Secretariat obviously has a critical role to play. On the\r\none hand, led by its able Secretary-General, it must in its\r\nwork faithfully reflect the priorities set by Member States\r\nand transmitted through intergovernmental mandates; on the\r\nother, it is our responsibility to give the Secretariat the\r\nresources to do the work that we have assigned it.\r\nThere is much with which we agree in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s overview of current developments, which he\r\ndescribes as the contours of the new era. What we find\r\nabsent, somewhat surprisingly, is any mention of the\r\nimperative and critical need for the world community to\r\npursue the goal of nuclear disarmament, to which all\r\nMember States are committed, with the sense of urgency it\r\ndeserves. As long as nuclear weapons exist, the world itself\r\ncannot be safe. We regret, therefore, that this year there has\r\nbeen an impasse in the Conference on Disarmament and the\r\nUnited Nations Disarmament Commission on the issue of\r\nnuclear disarmament. Having, through the indefinite\r\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), perpetuated a monopoly on\r\nnuclear weapons, nuclear-weapon States espouse non-\r\nproliferation treaties as disarmament measures, impeding\r\nprogress towards genuine nuclear disarmament. We\r\nbelieve that, in accordance with the principles and\r\npriorities of the Final Document of the first special\r\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament,\r\nthe United Nations has the foremost responsibility to\r\npromote nuclear disarmament.\r\nOver the years the United Nations has developed a\r\nrange of activities that promote the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Peacekeeping finds no\r\nmention in the Charter of the United Nations, but has\r\nalmost become synonymous with the United Nations in\r\nthe popular imagination. The United Nations has had its\r\ngreatest successes in peacekeeping, but also, in recent\r\nyears, its most serious controversies. Problems perhaps\r\narose because neither the Security Council nor the\r\nSecretariat thought through the implications of the\r\nmuscular approach to peacekeeping that was briefly\r\nadopted in the early 1990s, when it was put forward\r\nalmost as a panacea for various troubled regions. A sharp\r\ndownturn has taken place from mid-decade; in 1995, the\r\nSecretary-General reported that there were over 67,000\r\nblue helmets engaged in peacekeeping operations; by\r\nOctober of this year, the number had fallen to 18,000.\r\nDoes this mean that the world has become a safer or\r\nmore peaceful place? I think not.\r\nWhat we see is a decline in the United Nations role\r\nin peacekeeping and the evolution of concepts like\r\npeacekeeping and peace enforcement by proxy through\r\ncoalitions of the willing; even more innovative\r\nmechanisms are being thought of, including what might\r\nalmost be called the franchising of peacekeeping by the\r\nUnited Nations to those who can respond the quickest.\r\nThese and other ad hoc arrangements may be expedient,\r\nbut they may also be guided by considerations other than\r\na commitment to peace. We have to ask whether these are\r\nthe best means of ensuring international peace and\r\nsecurity, enhancing the United Nations role in collective\r\nsecurity or indeed bringing about savings in costs. These\r\nare questions raised in the work of the Secretariat and by\r\ntrends in peacekeeping, the answers to which we need to\r\nfind.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s attention to the\r\nnew transnational threats of international crime, drug\r\ntrafficking, money laundering and terrorism, and warmly\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\napplaud his determination to position the United Nations to\r\ncombat them. However, we note with disappointment that,\r\napart from the consolidation of the various functions into a\r\nsingle office, an addition of only two professional posts has\r\nbeen proposed to strengthen the United Nations capacity to\r\naddress issues related to terrorism. Tokenism is dangerous\r\nwhen the challenge is so real, powerful and widespread. We\r\nwould encourage the Secretariat to allocate the resources it\r\nneeds to counter these global challenges effectively and to\r\nask for more intergovernmental support if these are\r\ninadequate.\r\nWe have read with interest the Secretary-General’s\r\nanalysis of the global economic scenario and share his\r\nassessment of the challenges and risks of globalization and\r\nliberalization. The recovery of the 1990s could be more\r\nsustained, since it is based both on higher growth rates in\r\ndeveloping countries, which may well endure, and on the\r\nrevitalization of the economies in transition. But, while\r\ndeveloping countries are increasingly crucial to world\r\ngrowth, this growing centrality has not been reflected in\r\ntheir enhanced participation in rule-setting or decision-\r\nmaking processes. Also, as the Secretary-General has noted\r\nelsewhere, the transnational forces that propel global\r\nchanges, in particular mobile investment and finance, are\r\nweakening the ability of national Governments to influence\r\neconomic and social outcomes, often putting the fulfilment\r\nof even national political commitments, not to mention the\r\nability to influence global trends, beyond the reach of\r\nelected national representatives.\r\nAt the same time, most developing countries continue\r\nto be faced with the problems of poverty, the lack of\r\nadequate infrastructure, human resource development and\r\ntechnological deficits. Among the recent successes of the\r\nUnited Nations has been the forging of an international\r\nconsensus on certain areas of global concern and priority\r\nthrough the recent series of global conferences. However,\r\nthe management of natural resources and human\r\nsettlements, the provision of basic social services, the\r\nsupport required for targeted programmes for poverty\r\nalleviation, the correction of acute gender disabilities, social\r\nprotection, employment generation and skill development,\r\nthe improvements sought in public administration and\r\ngovernance — all priorities defined by the global\r\ncommunity — are typically activities that require public\r\nresources spent through public entities. The fundamental\r\nquestion we need to ask is whether these globally defined\r\npriorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective\r\naction or whether there is a greater role for international\r\ncooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and\r\nexternal resources to complement, in a commensurate\r\nmanner, the considerable ongoing efforts by developing\r\ncountries through their own initiatives at the national\r\nlevel.\r\nWe need an international consensus on the role of\r\nthe United Nations in effectively facilitating the creation\r\nof an international economic environment that is\r\nconducive to sustained economic growth, particularly in\r\ndeveloping countries, to ensure the availability of\r\nresources for investments in the social and environmental\r\nsectors and for poverty eradication. The ongoing\r\ndiscussions on the Secretary-General’s reform proposals\r\nshould lead to decisions that strengthen the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the economic and development spheres\r\nand ensure that any division of international labour does\r\nnot restrict it solely to the social sector nor tip the balance\r\nwholly towards its normative functions. We need to\r\nensure a role for the United Nations as a facilitator of\r\ngrowth, development and prosperity that is shared\r\nequitably among nations. For this, it is imperative that\r\ndevelopment, sustained economic growth and the\r\neradication of poverty become the principal cross-sectoral\r\npriorities on the agenda of the United Nations for the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe United Nations therefore has a wide charter of\r\nresponsibilities as it approaches the millennium. We\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s attention to reform. As\r\nour Prime Minister said during the general debate, India\r\nhas a vital interest in a United Nations that is continually\r\nmaking itself more responsive to the needs of its Member\r\nStates and preparing itself to serve them better. We will\r\nsupport all initiatives that help the United Nations adapt\r\nto a rapidly changing environment and to the mandates of\r\nthe international community.\r\nAgainst these yardsticks, we must ask ourselves if\r\nthe process of reform so far has had the effects we would\r\nhave expected. It is, for instance, quite extraordinary that\r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice should\r\nhave to complain to the Sixth Committee at this session\r\nof the General Assembly that the Court, facing the largest\r\nworkload in its history, was finding itself severely\r\nconstrained because the United Nations had not given it\r\nthe resources it needed. Nor is it at all desirable, either\r\nfor Member States or the Secretariat that serves them, that\r\nthe work of the Committees of the General Assembly has\r\nbeen delayed because documentation is delayed.\r\nQuite clearly, cutting costs has not always made the\r\nUnited Nations more efficient. If we want the United\r\nNations to be more active on our behalf, we must give it\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nthe resources it needs. Setting out to tackle the titanic and\r\ncomplex forces which call for global action with the United\r\nNations in a financial crisis is not the best way to promote\r\nour collective interests. Member States must demonstrate\r\nthe political will to pay the United Nations all their dues, in\r\nfull and on time, and to pay as much as the United Nations,\r\nwithin fiscal prudence, needs to discharge its mandates.\r\nThe Secretary-General has reported on the need for the\r\nUnited Nations to engage with civil society. We support\r\nthis, but greater discipline and responsibility need to be\r\nintroduced in the terms of interaction with this burgeoning\r\ncivil society. Recently we have seen an industrialist making\r\nthe United Nations an extraordinarily generous pledge that\r\nis almost 10 per cent of its regular budget. While such\r\ncontributions can certainly supplement the United Nations\r\nresources, we need to consider very carefully the\r\nimplications on its functioning if funding from sources over\r\nwhich there is no intergovernmental control affects the\r\npriorities set by Member States. Such financing for the\r\nUnited Nations cannot be a substitute for the financial\r\nsupport from Member States which is mandated by the\r\nCharter.\r\nLastly, for the United Nations to be more effective it\r\nmust also become more representative and democratic in its\r\nfunctioning. The legitimacy of the Security Council will be\r\nenhanced when developing countries, which constitute the\r\nvast majority of the United Nations membership, are\r\nrepresented equitably in the category of permanent\r\nmembership. The General Assembly, the most\r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations, must be given\r\nnew life and should breathe that life into the other bodies\r\nof the system. The agendas and priorities of the\r\nOrganization should reflect the felt needs of the many.\r\nThe United Nations was established because we felt\r\nthat all of us stood to gain from it. That universalist vision\r\nshould continue to guide the functioning of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMr. Guarini (United States of America): I am\r\nprivileged to speak on behalf of the United States\r\ndelegation this morning. My name is Frank Guarini, and I\r\nam the representative to the General Assembly on the\r\nUnited States delegation. I also had the privilege of serving\r\nas a congressman in the United States House of\r\nRepresentatives in Washington for 14 years.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on the work of the\r\nOrganization is his annual address to the membership and,\r\nby extension, to all stakeholders in the Organization. We\r\nwere impressed that for the first time the Secretary-\r\nGeneral made use of an important political and media\r\nmoment at the opening of this session’s general debate to\r\nintroduce orally this, his “State of the United Nations”\r\nreport.\r\nThis annual report is meant to inform us and spur the\r\nGeneral Assembly to action, as does the reporting of the\r\nother principal organs to the Assembly. But this year’s\r\nreport on the work of the organization, the first of this\r\nincumbent Secretary-General, also compels us to\r\ncontemplate the direction of the Organization. It considers\r\nthe contours of our new era, better ways to manage\r\nchange and possible steps ahead. The United States\r\ndelegation accepts this opportunity, particularly given the\r\nreport’s premise that\r\n“the Organization must learn to make far better use\r\nof its major potential source of institutional strength:\r\nthe many complementarities and synergies that exist\r\nwithin it.” [A/52/1, para. 3]\r\nThe contours of our new era are too varied to\r\ndescribe here. But let us simply agree with the report that\r\nkey forces transforming the world suggest the need for an\r\nintergovernmental organization as a vital and effective\r\ninstrument of international cooperation.\r\nIn the course of arguing for a more sustainable and\r\nmore stable Organization this past year, Member States\r\nand the Secretary-General alike have been seized by its\r\nfiscal precariousness. Admittedly, my delegation has\r\nshared the pressures from our Capitol on this point. But\r\nso many Member States have also felt these individual\r\npressures. All of us have been arguing for material means\r\nto attend to beneficial activities. My delegation’s\r\nprescription is that incremental adjustments in favour of\r\nfinancial support that is less dependent on any one\r\nMember State are again needed for the general health of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nMy delegation’s ability to participate with more\r\nconfidence and with the goodwill of colleagues here is in\r\nneed of improvement, as is the Organization in need of\r\namounts due which must satisfy its work. We request that\r\nthis Assembly during its regular session approve the\r\nadjustment of the scales of assessments for both the\r\nregular budget and the peacekeeping budget in ways\r\nwhich will restore such participation in furtherance of the\r\nAssembly’s agreed mandates.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nRevised scales of assessment would further serve as a\r\nvisible way to manage change. The report states that\r\n“all parts of the United Nations have continuously\r\nadapted their strategies and programmes to the new\r\nand fluid international context”. [ibid., para. 21]\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that reform is not an\r\nevent, but indeed a process. It is a process for strategically\r\nmanaging change in our world. Reform succeeds when\r\nMember States and the Secretary-General give themselves\r\nthe capability to act on change, instead of having to react\r\nto it.\r\nThe work of the Organization has been revitalized with\r\nthe challenge of reform, going beyond mere resources\r\nmanagement to incorporate strategic management on behalf\r\nof the priorities of the medium-term plan. And they are:\r\ninternational peace and security; promotion of sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development;\r\ndevelopment of Africa; promotion of human rights;\r\ncoordination of humanitarian assistance efforts; promotion\r\nof justice and international law; disarmament; drug control;\r\ncrime prevention; and combating international terrorism.\r\nWe note improvements in the report’s format and\r\nstructure over those of previous years. This is one example\r\nthat indicates improved stewardship of the resources\r\nentrusted to the Secretary-General as chief administrative\r\nofficer. For 52 years Member States have also entrusted to\r\nthe United Nations their aspirations and ideals for a better\r\nand peaceful world.\r\nHow has the stock of the United Nations fared in the\r\nlast year?\r\nGiven the high degree of political attention throughout\r\nthe year, and particularly during the general debate, we\r\nurge colleagues to take note of improvements in the\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations. This would enable more\r\neffective promotion of the goals of the Charter. Innovations\r\nimplemented on the Secretary-General’s authority are\r\nmaking reality out of what previously had been our hopes\r\nfor this noble experiment, the United Nations. The first use\r\nof a cabinet by the Secretary-General, for example,\r\ndemonstrates that the most potent resource of the United\r\nNations is its desire to honour its own latent potential. We\r\nshould work its useful practices, move beyond those that\r\nhave served their purposes, and fine-tune for both sending\r\nand receiving clearer messages in furtherance of mandates\r\nestablished by all Member States.\r\nThis Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by\r\nthe recent round of global conferences, particularly in the\r\nareas of good governance, human rights, democratization,\r\ninternational economic cooperation and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, development operations, preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peaceful settlement of disputes and\r\ndisarmament, as well as humanitarian action and\r\npeacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building.\r\nStrategically, we are managing ourselves with these\r\npriorities in what we find prescribed between the lines of\r\nevery page of the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nwork of the Organization.\r\nI shall comment briefly on some passages in the\r\nreport. The consolidation of the Centre for Human Rights\r\ninto the Office of the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights will strengthen the United Nations human rights\r\nmachinery. It will also rightly make human rights a major\r\nconsideration throughout all United Nations activities. It\r\nis critical to promote democratic practices and yet have\r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We\r\nsupport bringing together development activities in a\r\nUnited Nations Development Group chaired by the United\r\nNations Development Programme Administrator.\r\nEnhancing field level coordination should be its priority.\r\nCommon premises and services would produce greater\r\nefficiency and therefore free up more resources for\r\ndeveloping programmes. The United Nations Conference\r\non Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the regional\r\neconomic commissions require further refinements to\r\nstreamline operations and also to increase efficiency. The\r\ncompleted consolidation of three Secretariat Departments\r\ninto the new Department of Economic and Social Affairs\r\nwill promote efficiency and reduce administrative expenses.\r\nThe Secretary-General has created a Department for\r\nDisarmament Affairs. While we applaud his attention to\r\nthis serious problem, it is important that the United\r\nNations maintain budgetary restraint. We will therefore\r\nwork to ensure that the new department does not\r\nduplicate or interfere with ongoing related work.\r\nThe Department of Humanitarian Affairs was not\r\neffective in delivering humanitarian assistance. The\r\nSecretary-General was wise to abolish it and to transfer\r\nits core functions to the new Office of the Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator, which, furthermore, would fill a much\r\nneeded coordination role. It would assess a situation and\r\nfocus on coordinating an appropriate response along with\r\nother United Nations entities, all dealing with the\r\nnecessary operational activities. This should lead to a\r\nmore rapid and effective response.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report draws attention to the\r\nsteps ahead. This house, the General Assembly, has become\r\nrecognized universally as the forum for seeing and being\r\nseen, hearing and being heard. Like another 52-year-old\r\ninvention, the Internet, it is evolving into an increasingly\r\nbusy, real time, global chat forum. Both are promoting\r\nindividual and shared interests. As an illustration, at the\r\nopening of this session of the Assembly the United States\r\nSecretary of State scheduled an unprecedented two weeks\r\nat the United Nations to engage effectively and efficiently\r\nwith foreign leaders and ministers from around the world.\r\nHer success was reported in the press here as an innovative\r\nway to leverage our foreign policy resources.\r\nThe General Assembly has the opportunity to become\r\na living, breathing Internet for the world. We must\r\ncontemplate what that means for the Organization’s future.\r\nWe must also consider upgrading the way we process our\r\nwork and explore enhanced capabilities for furthering our\r\nMember States together, using all our priorities as a guide.\r\nAgain, reform has a role to play: to fit this mechanism with\r\nthe most appropriate devices and technicians available to\r\nrealize its growing potential as an increasingly effective\r\nintergovernmental and operational forum.\r\nWe have read the Secretary-General’s report, which\r\ncalls for new paradigms of cooperation. We look forward\r\nto making far better use of the United Nations latent\r\npotentials on behalf of all its Members’ mandates.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): The debate on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the work of the Organization provides\r\nus with one of the few opportunities we have to look at the\r\nwhole rather than at specific parts of our work. The United\r\nNations is shaped by political realities in the world. Indeed,\r\nin large parts it can but mirror these developments, while\r\nat least sometimes being a catalyst for positive change. At\r\nits best, the United Nations is a tool we agree to use to\r\ntackle the growing number of challenges none of us can\r\ntake on alone.\r\nIt is therefore not surprising that the Organization finds\r\nitself in transition. The bipolar world order ended only a\r\nfew years ago. Since then, we have witnessed the\r\nbeginnings of the evolution of a multipolar order, the\r\neventual form of which we can hardly sketch out at this\r\npoint in time. As the Secretary-General rightly points out in\r\nhis report, this transition is marked by seemingly\r\ncontradictory trends of integration and fragmentation. Our\r\nown debates on many important issues have clearly\r\nreflected these contradictions as well as another typical sign\r\nof change: the split between forward-looking and backward-\r\noriented policies. History teaches us that fundamental\r\nchange cannot and will not be stopped by clinging to the\r\npast. If we want to make use of this unique opportunity,\r\nwe have to embrace change and shape it.\r\nLast year, when we spoke on this agenda item, we\r\nexpressed the hope that we would be able to complete a\r\nmeaningful reform of the United Nations in 1997.\r\nUnfortunately, progress has been slow and somewhat less\r\nthan satisfactory. The Secretary-General presented us with\r\na balanced and substantial package of measures and\r\nrecommendations in July that squarely address the\r\nchallenges we face. It is now our responsibility as\r\nMember States to do our part if we are to fulfil the\r\npledge made by the Heads of States and Governments to\r\nmake this Organization fit for the twenty-first century.\r\nWe hope that the intensive work done in the informal\r\nmeetings of the plenary over the past few weeks will very\r\nsoon be concluded with a clear signal that we, the\r\nMember States, are serious about strengthening the United\r\nNations.\r\nAs a traditionally loyal supporter of the United\r\nNations, Austria cannot abide seeing our Organization fall\r\nprey to creeping irrelevance. If we continue to oppose\r\nreform for opposition’s sake or for fear of the unknown,\r\nwe run the very real risk of stripping the United Nations\r\nof importance. Many have bemoaned the lack of interest\r\npublic opinion has shown in United Nations matters. We\r\nhave asked for new strategies to better sell our product to\r\nthe media. But if we, the membership as a whole, insist\r\non wasting our time fighting over minute changes in\r\nlanguage, we shall very soon no longer have a product to\r\nsell. If we do not keep the Organization a capable player,\r\nit will become a bystander. And it is much too important\r\nfor that to happen.\r\nIn order to remain relevant, this Organization must\r\ntoday, more than ever before, better focus on those issues\r\nwhere it can make a real difference. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report before us sets an excellent example in\r\nhighlighting these areas of activity. We welcome the\r\nprecise nature of the report, as well as the fact that the\r\nSecretary-General could present it personally before this\r\nGeneral Assembly at the beginning of its session. We\r\nwelcome the effort to provide focus to the general debate.\r\nThe tasks of the United Nations are manifold. They\r\nreach from the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity to the promotion of sustainable development and\r\npost-conflict peace-building; from the eradication of\r\npoverty to the promotion of human rights for all; from the\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nprotection of our environment to the further elaboration of\r\ninternational law. In all these, as in many other areas, such\r\nas drug control and crime prevention — a field which the\r\nSecretary-General rightly describes as one of major concern\r\nfor the international community — universal debate, policy\r\nformulation and norm-setting, as well as the implementation\r\nof agreed measures, are required.\r\nThis house is based on a democratic structure not\r\nunlike the parliaments of most of its Member States. Thus,\r\na wide spectrum of support is needed for effective action.\r\nAt the same time, those who truly believe in the\r\nOrganization and in its unique possibilities cannot allow\r\nthis potential to be endangered and jeopardized by those\r\nwho have lost faith.\r\nWe firmly believe that reform is necessary for its own\r\nsake. I know that many delegations in this Hall share this\r\nview in principle, but have strong reservations about\r\nreforming the Organization in an unnecessarily difficult\r\nfinancial situation. Important amounts of money are\r\nwithheld, contrary to consensually adopted obligations.\r\nWith no guarantee that even a consensus on in-depth\r\nreform would secure the financial future of the United\r\nNations, it is not hard to take their point. This Organization\r\ndoes not belong to any one country or group of countries\r\nalone. It is time for all of us to face the realities shaping\r\nour cooperation. To make meaningful progress, we need the\r\nbroadest possible support on the floor of this Hall as well\r\nas in the bank accounts of the Organization.\r\nThe Secretary-General has repeatedly said that reform\r\nis a process, not an event. If we cannot provide a good start\r\nto this process within the next few weeks, it could turn out\r\nto be a non-event. There could be no justification for such\r\na happening.\r\nMr. Manley (United Kingdom): I shall be brief. As so\r\nmany have said this morning, the report which is before us\r\nis most welcome, both in its form and in its content. We\r\nshare the strong commitment expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the report to fundamental, not piecemeal, reform\r\nat the United Nations; to developing the central role of the\r\nOrganization in the fields of peace, development, human\r\nrights and the environment; and to organizing the structure\r\nof the Organization around these core tasks. I would add\r\nthat we very strongly support the comments just made by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Austria in regard to the\r\nreform of this Organization. We are sure, for our part, that\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General which is before us will\r\ninfluence our work in all those areas, including reform, and\r\nfor the better.\r\nThe British delegation would also like to commend\r\nthe Secretary-General for the form of the report and the\r\nmanner of its presentation. It is exactly the sort of shorter\r\nand more forward-looking report which the Working\r\nGroup on United Nations strengthening hoped to see. And\r\nthe Secretary-General’s decision to introduce the report in\r\nplenary immediately before the start of the general debate\r\nwas a bold and innovative step which gave greater focus\r\nand a higher profile to the debate that ensued amongst our\r\nMinisters. It is steps like these which, more than\r\nanything, can help to revitalize this Assembly and give\r\nnew energy to the Organization as a whole. We welcome\r\nthem wholeheartedly.\r\nMr. Dumitriu (Romania): I am pleased to start the\r\nfew remarks that my delegation wishes to make on\r\nagenda item 10 by welcoming the new, concise format of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe first report of Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\ngives us a broad and comprehensive view on what the\r\nUnited Nations does and what it is expected to do, and on\r\nthe features of the global environment in which it works.\r\nLess descriptive than previous reports, but no less\r\nsubstantial, the report highlights better the uniqueness of\r\nthe United Nations as the most inclusive multilateral\r\nframework in a position to maximize international\r\ncooperation in facing the powerful forces of globalization.\r\nThe ample analysis presented in the first part of the\r\nreport — “Contours of the new era” — is not just an\r\nintellectual adornment to a colourless account of facts, be\r\nthey achievements or failures. It is, rather, a lucid effort\r\nto convey a message that we may ignore at our peril.\r\nIt is not yet clear that globalization pushes mankind\r\nin the same direction. As emphasized by the report, the\r\nintegrative trends are accompanied by tendencies towards\r\nfragmentation. The information superhighway is taking us\r\nto the digitally organized life and cyber-mentalities, but\r\non its sidewalks illiteracy and extreme poverty continue\r\nto coexist. The transnational expansion of civil society\r\nalso provides energies abused by the destructive\r\ntransboundary forces of organized crime, terrorism and\r\ndrug-trafficking. The rapid technological developments are\r\nnot accompanied by a superior sense of morality and\r\nethics.\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is apparent that the\r\ninternational community has the duty to take advantage of\r\nand reinforce the available multilateral mechanisms,\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nhowever imperfect. We are not allowed to indulge ourselves\r\nin the blind defence of narrow, selfish interests and let the\r\nOrganization be shaken by curable financial diseases and\r\nfixable structural weaknesses. The United Nations is still\r\nthe best-equipped instrument of concerted action of nations\r\nand can further be made able to harness the mutual benefits\r\nof globalization while managing its adverse effects.\r\nThis is the message my delegation reads in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General, and we support it.\r\nThe report identifies a series of needs that should be\r\ntranslated into priorities for the United Nations: to deal with\r\ninter-ethnic and other domestic conflicts, instability and\r\nsecurity; to make all countries reap the benefits of\r\nglobalization; to enable marginalized countries to participate\r\nactively in the global economy; to empower marginalized\r\npeople to participate actively in the life of their societies by\r\nsupporting participation, human rights and democracy; and\r\nto assert individuality and diversity and respect for law,\r\nboth nationally and internationally.\r\nThe efforts of the United Nations in these directions\r\nare echoed in the second part of the report, entitled\r\n“Managing change”. My delegation agrees with the\r\nconclusions reached by the Secretary-General as to the\r\nmain areas of action of the United Nations. Indeed, good\r\ngovernance, human rights and democratization are essential\r\nmeans to accomplish the objectives of peace, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and broadly shared prosperity.\r\nThis fundamental issue was deeply considered by the\r\nministers and representatives of 77 countries and 47 non-\r\ngovernmental organizations which participated in the Third\r\nInternational Conference of the New or Restored\r\nDemocracies on Democracy and Development, which took\r\nplace in Bucharest from 2 to 4 September 1997. In the final\r\ndocument, they emphasized the\r\n“almost universal recognition that a democratic system\r\nof government is the best model to ensure a\r\nframework of liberties for lasting solutions to the\r\npolitical, economic and social problems that our\r\nsocieties face.” [A/52/334, appendix, third paragraph]\r\nIt was also recognized that\r\n“The real challenge today is how to strengthen\r\ndemocracy through the practices of efficient\r\ngovernment, transparency and anti-corruption\r\nmeasures, in order to promote sustainable human\r\ndevelopment and bring the State closer to the\r\npeople.” [ibid, tenth paragraph]\r\nMy delegation detected with satisfaction the spirit of\r\nthe Bucharest document reflected in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe sections on international economic cooperation,\r\nsustainable development and development operations are\r\nrealistic and action-oriented. We fully agree with the\r\npronouncement that competent, accountable and\r\nresponsive public institutions are essential for the\r\nachievement of development. The United Nations should\r\nfoster a supportive international framework and try to\r\ncounterbalance, through more efficient advocacy and\r\nbetter management of resources, the effects of the current\r\ndecline in official development assistance.\r\nThe sections on preventive diplomacy, peaceful\r\nsettlements of disputes, peacekeeping and post-conflict\r\npeace-building give us the picture of a quite impressive\r\narray of actions by a variety of organizations, States or\r\ngroups of States and prominent personalities. All were\r\nmobilized and backed by the United Nations. They have\r\nnot solved all the tensions, disputes or conflicts they dealt\r\nwith. Nevertheless, even in the worst of cases, actions\r\nunder United Nations auspices discouraged their\r\nescalation. What they accomplished was the result of the\r\nfact that they bore the imprint of the moral authority of\r\nthe United Nations. That is something that the\r\nOrganization’s current tribulations and its critics cannot\r\ndiminish.\r\nAs a final remark on this part, allow me, Sir, to\r\nallude to the burning issue of internal conflicts. These\r\nconflicts are correctly seen as one of the side-effects of\r\nthe end of the cold war and super-Power rivalry.\r\nNevertheless, one can also see that the States themselves\r\nbehave with more responsibility than in the past and are\r\nless inclined to wage war against each other. If that is\r\nadmitted, we should credit the United Nations, which\r\noffers norms for international conduct and sets up\r\nbenchmarks which few are willing to ignore.\r\nThe last part of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral — “The steps ahead” — like the whole\r\ndocument, looks at the future. The future advocated by\r\nhim, however, is closer than one might think. As a matter\r\nof fact, this part is the renewal of a strong plea to\r\nMember States to proceed with the approval of the\r\nprogramme of reform. Our attention is invited to the idea\r\nthat the United Nations must undergo fundamental, not\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\npiecemeal, reform. He requests us not to surrender to inertia\r\nand to accept the challenges of change.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to reiterate its\r\nown support for the reform package proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General. We believe that it is the responsibility of\r\nMember States, which remain while Secretaries-General go.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to quote again from the final\r\ndocument adopted by the Bucharest Conference of the New\r\nor Restored Democracies:\r\n“Managing globalization requires capable leaders,\r\npolitical will and ethical determination to assume the\r\nrisk and the moral responsibility of change.” [ibid,\r\nappendix, part I E, second paragraph]\r\nThat coincided with the meaning my delegation has taken\r\nfrom its reading of the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe work of the Organization.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization stands out for\r\nmany reasons: it is short and concise; it is comprehensive,\r\nanalytical and thought-provoking. It should be presented to\r\na wide readership. It lays out the threads which we, the\r\nMember States, must pick up in order to give our\r\nOrganization a sense of purpose and direction for the\r\nfuture.\r\nGermany commends the Secretary-General and his\r\ncolleagues for this outstanding piece of work. It is\r\ncomplementary to the Secretary-General’s reform proposals.\r\nThe report demonstrates in many instances how these\r\nproposals tie in with the work and practice of the\r\nOrganization. Furthermore, it suggests looking at the\r\nOrganization from a new perspective and provides the\r\nreader with an integrated view of its different units and\r\nstructures. It brings to bear a fundamental experience that\r\nthe whole is more than the sum of its parts. To create this\r\nwhole, the Secretary-General has announced his intention\r\nto refocus the Organization and to make its efforts more\r\ncoherent. We found ample evidence of this endeavour in\r\nthe report, and we therefore welcome it.\r\nThe Secretary-General has rightly put good\r\ngovernance, human rights and democratization, international\r\neconomic cooperation, sustainable development and\r\ndevelopment operations at the top of the list of United\r\nNations activities. The cluster of good governance, human\r\nrights and democratization has been identified as an\r\nessential building block for meeting the objectives of\r\nsustained development, prosperity and peace. At the same\r\ntime, development, peace and prosperity will remain\r\nelusive if the international community fails to secure full\r\nand equal rights for women and girls, who constitute half\r\nthe population of the world. The United Nations is called\r\nupon to continue to promote the empowerment of women\r\nand their full integration into the societies of the coming\r\ncenturies.\r\nThe capacity and activities of the United Nations in\r\nthese areas have increased in recent years. New and\r\ninnovative approaches have been pursued, such as\r\nadvisory services and technical assistance. Human rights\r\nfield operations also contribute to protecting and\r\npromoting respect for human rights. United Nations\r\nelectoral assistance is so sought after that not all requests\r\ncan met. Germany has supported these various activities\r\nwith contributions to voluntary funds as well as by\r\nproviding election observers or staff for various field\r\nmissions, and we commend the Secretary-General for his\r\ndetermination and leadership in this field.\r\nWe are facing new challenges in the areas of\r\ninternational economic cooperation and development\r\noperations to which we must respond. There is a growing\r\nrecognition among countries and the public at large that\r\nthese demand concerted action by States. As a result, we\r\nhave witnessed a worldwide trend towards multilateral\r\ncooperation. But a substantial part of the world population\r\nhas remained excluded from the new opportunities\r\npresented by globalization and technological innovations.\r\nThe daily lives of millions of people continue to be\r\nruined by the scourge of war and other violent conflicts.\r\nIn a world which is moving ever closer to becoming a\r\nglobal village, this is deeply disturbing. We must\r\ntherefore address existing and emerging crises and\r\nconflicts more vigorously and more systematically. We\r\nmust refocus our attention towards the underlying causes\r\nof the problems at hand.\r\nBetween 1980 and 1994, global expenditures for\r\nbilateral emergency assistance rose from 2 per cent to 10\r\nper cent of official development assistance. Too many\r\nresources have to be diverted to contain crises and to\r\nalleviate the most acute sufferings of people. In many\r\ncases, projects for long-term development already\r\nunderway are destroyed or have to be put on hold until\r\nstable conditions prevail. Damage prevention is less costly\r\nthan damage repair. For this reason, Germany has begun\r\nto refocus its attention on crisis prevention through the\r\ntraditional instruments of development cooperation. The\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\naim is to assess the potential for crisis systematically and\r\nto incorporate the results in our development cooperation.\r\nThe internal political and economic environment of a\r\ncountry is crucial to the success or failure of development.\r\nThere are five criteria which we believe are conducive to\r\neffective development. These criteria are respect for human\r\nrights, popular participation in political decision-making, the\r\nrule of law and guaranteed legal security, the introduction\r\nof a social market economy, and the orientation of State\r\naction towards development.\r\nLet me give a few examples which might illustrate\r\nthese considerations. The aim of development assistance is\r\nto improve the livelihoods of people, especially the poorest.\r\nSteep population increases can exacerbate competition not\r\nonly for social services, employment and other income\r\nopportunities but also for arable land, water and energy.\r\nOur concept emphasizes improved family planning services,\r\nand in this context helps promoting women’s access to\r\nhealth and education services.\r\nMarginalization of social strata of the population may\r\nalso lead to conflict. Development cooperation can help\r\ncountries to establish their own systems of participatory\r\nsociety.\r\nTo prevent crises from perpetuating themselves, we\r\nhave to set up programmes which help reintegrate former\r\ncombatants into civil life, rebuild infrastructure, restore civil\r\nadministrations and rekindle economic activities. These\r\nefforts can play an important long-term role in the\r\nframework of post-conflict peace-building.\r\nWe welcome the fact that many of the operational\r\nactivities of the United Nations, through the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Population\r\nFund, the World Food Programme and the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, are also undertaken in these areas.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly held in\r\nJune this year highlighted the threats caused by\r\nenvironmental degradation. One case in point is global\r\nwarming caused by greenhouse gases, which has the\r\npotential to wipe entire countries — States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations — from the face of the Earth. These\r\nenvironmental challenges must be met. Unfortunately, our\r\nworld body has not so far been able to respond adequately\r\nto our high expectations.\r\nMeanwhile, the incidence of environmental disasters\r\nwhich can be related to environmental degradation seems to\r\nhave increased dramatically in recent years. To mitigate\r\ntheir impact and magnitude, it has been suggested that an\r\nearly-warning system should be established. This concept\r\nhas been actively promoted by my Government since the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly, in the\r\ncourse of deliberations and through voluntary financial\r\ncontributions. Our idea of an environmental early-warning\r\nsystem has been cast into a resolution. We now look\r\nforward to the first report of the Secretary-General on this\r\nissue, and we will continue to support system-wide efforts\r\nin this regard.\r\nWe do not suggest that we have invented anything\r\nnew by promoting development cooperation as a\r\npreventive tool. All we are doing is to try to refocus the\r\napplication of the existing instruments of development\r\nassistance more consciously in order to address these\r\ncomplex issues, and we invite the international\r\ncommunity likewise to increase their efforts so as to\r\ntackle these very pressing tasks. Let us cooperate so that\r\nin future sustained and uninterrupted development will be\r\nthe rule, and the need for peacekeeping the exception.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report clearly shows that the\r\nUnited Nations is productive in all the areas which I have\r\nmentioned. The major world conferences and summits of\r\nthe last decade have defined the global agenda for years\r\nto come. Through these landmark events, we have\r\ncommitted ourselves to high standards and goals. Now is\r\nthe time to make them reality; the United Nations should\r\nbe the driving force in this process.\r\nHowever, the United Nations needs a well\r\ncoordinated, coherent and comprehensive approach to the\r\nfollow-up of these conferences. This is why the Economic\r\nand Social Council must fulfil its role as a coordinating\r\nbody for the United Nations system; the Council should\r\nadapt its working methods to this task where needed. In\r\nthis regard, we expect next spring’s special session of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council to give new impetus to the\r\ncoordinated implementation of the outcomes of the Rio,\r\nCopenhagen, Beijing and other conferences.\r\nAs the world undergoes profound changes, we as\r\nactors on the international stage must adapt, and so must\r\nUnited Nations. For years, this Organization has been\r\nstruggling with difficulties which have reduced its ability\r\nto fully perform its functions. It has been in a financial\r\ncrisis for the last 10 years, and its present financial\r\nconstitution seems worse than ever. In the area of\r\nmanagerial and institutional reform, realistic and far-\r\nreaching proposals are on the table, but Member States\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nhave yet to respond commensurately in order to turn vision\r\ninto reality. Furthermore, the debate on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is not going forward as we would like to\r\nsee it do. The “full-picture” proposal of the previous\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Razali Ismail, is on\r\nthe table. This balanced reform proposal has been\r\nthoroughly discussed. No other plan is in sight which could\r\nmatch it. We should not let more time go by without\r\nseizing this historic opportunity.\r\nBut, as the saying goes, every crisis is an opportunity\r\nin disguise. Let us therefore take the necessary decisions on\r\nall the reforms now. Let us provide the United Nations with\r\nthe means to fully play its role in the next century. The\r\nSecretary-General has proposed the direction in which this\r\nOrganization should go. It is now for us, the Member\r\nStates, to decide, and to help him get on with the job.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): I wish to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his impressive first report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, which highlights the key forces transforming\r\nthe international community and envisions how the United\r\nNations must respond to them.\r\nI wish to consider the following points: human rights\r\nand democratization; peaceful settlement of disputes and\r\npeacekeeping operations; economic cooperation and\r\ndevelopment; new transnational threats; and management\r\nand communications.\r\nThe United Nations plays a crucial role in the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms, which the Vienna Declaration of 1993 reaffirms\r\nas the birthright of all human beings. It also stresses that\r\ndemocracy, development and respect for human rights are\r\ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing. We fully subscribe\r\nto the Secretary-General’s measures to ensure that the\r\ncross-cutting nature of these issues is fully reflected in the\r\nUnited Nations programme of work, in which the Office of\r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights is called on to\r\nplay a pivotal role.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly underlines the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in strengthening the democratic systems of\r\nMember States by providing assistance at their request.\r\nThere is a strong need for more open channels of\r\ncommunication between the United Nations and civil\r\nsociety. It is high time that the United Nations\r\nacknowledged in unequivocal terms the contribution that\r\ncan be made to its work by civil society, in particular by\r\nnon-governmental organizations, which provided much of\r\nthe input to the international conferences of the 1990s in\r\nthe economic and social fields. We strongly believe that\r\nthe United Nations should devise ways and means to\r\nimprove its interaction with the non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nThe chapters on “Preventive diplomacy, peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes and disarmament” and\r\n“Peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building” represent\r\na realistic, accurate analysis of the United Nations role in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nAs the report underlines,\r\n“Early post-cold-war euphoria greatly exaggerated\r\nthe range of possibilities for expanding the scope of\r\nUnited Nations peace operations, but the more recent\r\nsense of limits may err in the opposite direction.”\r\n[A/52/1, para.108]\r\nAs we stated last year, Italy remains firmly convinced\r\nthat the United Nations cannot impose peace by waging\r\nwar. The United Nations has neither the vocation nor the\r\nstructure and resources to carry out peace enforcement\r\noperations. Instead, it should rely on regional\r\norganizations or coalitions of States that are better\r\nequipped to plan and implement these operations more\r\nsuccessfully.\r\nBut for all other peacekeeping operations, in the\r\nliteral sense of the term, we believe in the great efforts\r\nunder way to make stand-by arrangements, which Italy\r\nhas signed, to provide the United Nations with rapid\r\ndeployment capacity. To strengthen every component of\r\npeacekeeping, the Secretariat, in response to the Fifth\r\nCommittee’s invitation, should first define the concept of\r\nlogistic support as the frame of reference for all initiatives\r\nin the sector.\r\nWe are closely following the endeavours of the\r\nAfrican countries, and of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) — with which Italy actively collaborates —\r\nin particular, to improve the capacity to respond to and\r\nintervene in crisis situations on their continent. We look\r\nwith favour on the possible creation, within the\r\nframework of the United Nations, of a support group to\r\nstudy such issues and to offer concrete assistance to the\r\nAfrican States.\r\nNeedless to say, Italy also attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to the role of the United Nations in\r\npreventing, controlling and resolving conflicts. The report\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\neloquently describes the Secretary-General’s ceaseless\r\nefforts in every crisis area.\r\nAfrican initiatives have to deal with the extreme\r\ncomplexity that often characterizes crises on that continent.\r\nHowever, we believe that the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s special envoy to Central Africa, Mohamed\r\nSahnoun, have had a positive effect, and should be pursued\r\nin coordination with the action of other mediators, in\r\nparticular Aldo Ajello for the European Union.\r\nIn our opinion, the case of Albania also deserves\r\nspecial mention because of the excellent cooperation among\r\nall the international organizations involved. With\r\nextraordinary speed, the Security Council authorized a\r\nmultinational “coalition of the willing” — Operation\r\nAlba — led by Italy and deployed in Albania in a matter of\r\nonly a few days. Its mandate was to facilitate the\r\ndistribution of humanitarian aid and help create safe\r\nconditions for the missions of the international\r\norganizations operating in the country.\r\nDuring the Security Council debate of 14 August 1997\r\non the conclusion of Operation Alba, many delegations\r\ndescribed it as a model, including the following aspects:\r\nunity of intent by the group of countries involved; decisive,\r\nprompt action taken by the Security Council; a very clear\r\nmandate; definite limits on the time-frame; rapid planning\r\nand deployment; and in-depth political coordination and\r\nconsultation among all the parties involved, with none\r\nexcluded, through an ad hoc steering committee.\r\nNow that the emergency phase is over, each\r\ninternational organization will do its part for the overall\r\nrehabilitation of Albania. These include the United Nations,\r\nthe European Union and Commission, the international\r\nfinancial institutions, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, the\r\nhumanitarian agencies and organizations, the Western\r\nEuropean Union (WEU) and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO).\r\nIn the field of economic cooperation and development,\r\nItaly warmly welcomes the Secretary-General’s action to\r\nestablish the United Nations Development Group, which\r\nwill streamline the Organization’s operational activities for\r\ndevelopment. The decision to entrust the Administrator of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with\r\nthe responsibility of convening the Group is consistent with\r\nthe central role that UNDP plays in development. I wish to\r\nrecall here that, despite a decline in voluntary contributions\r\nto the general resources due to a temporary — and I\r\nunderline the word “temporary” — negative economic\r\njuncture, Italy is still one of the top donors of non-core\r\nresources to UNDP. The Development Programme for\r\nDisplaced Persons, Refugees and Returnees (PRODERE)\r\nand similar initiatives launched in Central America,\r\nMozambique, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and soon in\r\nAngola, illustrate the full extent of cooperation between\r\nItaly and UNDP. In this context, my country is also\r\nengaged in active, constant cooperation with the Alliance\r\nof Small Island States, a group of countries which must\r\nbe assisted in order to face the environmental changes and\r\ntheir adverse economic consequences for the planet.\r\nWhile the restructuring of UNDP will be conducive\r\nto more efficient and effective UNDP programmes,\r\nefficiency alone cannot solve the problem of poverty or\r\nensure sustainable development in developing countries.\r\nWhile it can help, this cannot be an alibi for donor\r\ncountries to lower their commitment to development\r\nassistance. At the Rome World Food Summit last\r\nNovember, high-level representatives of all Governments\r\npledged to cut in half by the year 2015 the number of\r\npeople suffering from malnutrition, currently estimated at\r\n840 million. For this, and for all other commitments\r\ncontained in the plans of action of the major United\r\nNations conferences, Italy will make every effort to\r\nprovide resources to the United Nations to fight to\r\neradicate poverty.\r\nWe fully endorse the Secretary-General’s vision of\r\nthe role of the United Nations in fighting new\r\ninternational threats. Criminal activities and drug\r\ntrafficking threaten the safety and welfare of citizens and\r\nnations around the world. In recognition of the\r\nseriousness of this phenomenon, the United Nations has\r\ndeveloped over the years crime and drug prevention\r\nprogrammes aimed at fostering international cooperation\r\nand strengthening the national capacity of Member States\r\nto meet these challenges.\r\nWe warmly welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiatives to strengthen the Vienna Office for Drug\r\nControl and Crime Prevention. This will enable the\r\nOrganization to make a crucial contribution to the fight\r\nagainst “uncivil society” actors, as the Secretary-General\r\nso rightly called them. The new Director of the Vienna\r\nOffice, Professor Pino Arlacchi, can provide genuine\r\nenthusiasm, dynamic leadership and tested expertise.\r\nThe ability of the United Nations to meet the\r\nchallenges of the future will also depend very much on its\r\ncapacity to deal efficiently and systematically with the\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nrising flow of information. We strongly support the\r\ninitiatives of the United Nations Secretariat for information\r\ntechnology changes in the structure and functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations. Major progress towards overcoming the\r\ngap in information technology will lead to a more efficient\r\nOrganization, lower costs and better services — by the\r\nway, we were delighted to see computers being installed in\r\nthe Delegates’ Lounge.\r\nIn this context we commend the results obtained by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council Ad Hoc Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on informatics, chaired by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Pakistan, our colleague Ambassador\r\nAhmad Kamal, whose peerless diplomatic ability and keen\r\ninsight made many of these results possible.\r\nA final comment on legal affairs: we note with\r\nsatisfaction the results achieved and the progress made in\r\nthe past year in the area of the codification and\r\ndevelopment of international law. In particular, we praise\r\nthe efforts carried out for the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court. The Preparatory Committee has\r\ndone, and we are confident will continue to do, an\r\nadmirable job in elaborating the text of the court’s statute,\r\nto be submitted to the Rome diplomatic conference next\r\nyear.\r\nThe debate on agenda item 59 concerning the reform\r\nof the Security Council is now scheduled for 4 December.\r\nThat is why I had not planned to touch on that issue in\r\ntoday’s discussion. However, since other delegations have\r\nraised this matter, I felt that I, too, had to make a couple of\r\nremarks — just a couple; I do not want to abuse the\r\npatience and time of the Assembly.\r\nI want to repeat that Italy is fully committed to the\r\nreform of the Security Council in view of the increased\r\nmembership of the United Nations and the need to meet the\r\nchallenges of the next centuries. Thus, we do recognize the\r\nurgency of this matter, but not — absolutely not — at the\r\ncost of making hasty decisions before real general\r\nagreement is reached. In this regard, resolution 48/26, by\r\nwhich the General Assembly established the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the reform of the Security Council,\r\nspecifically underlined — I wish to repeat this loud and\r\nclear — the need and importance of reaching “general\r\nagreement”.\r\nAs the President of the Republic of Italy, President\r\nScalfaro, mentioned in his United Nations Day message to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Italy is deeply convinced that no\r\nreform can be fair and effective unless it is inspired by the\r\nfundamental principles of our Charter. Allow me to\r\nremind the Assembly that these principles are equality of\r\nStates; equitable geographical representation; and the full\r\ninvolvement of all States in the life and responsibility of\r\nthe Organization, with none excluded. The reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is a matter of vital importance to this\r\nOrganization. We must beware of the temptation to take\r\nprocedural short cuts that may seem easy but would go\r\nagainst the letter and spirit of the Charter. Above all, they\r\ncould create irreparable damage to the United Nations and\r\nalso have negative repercussions on the current effort by\r\nthe Secretary-General to reform the Organization as a\r\nwhole.\r\nIt is for these reasons, and for these reasons only,\r\nthat we, together with a group of other Member States,\r\nhave recently taken initiatives aiming to safeguard the\r\nSecurity Council reform process from any attempt to\r\nimpose a time-frame; to prevent hasty solutions that\r\nwould disregard the fundamental provisions of our\r\nCharter; and, above all, to ensure that a genuine, global\r\nand general agreement can be reached beforehand on a\r\nmatter of such magnitude. As my Foreign Minister,\r\nMr. Dini, said in his speech in Rome on 29 October\r\ncelebrating United Nations Day, it is not true — I repeat\r\nhere — that we are moved by the desire to block the\r\nambition of one, two or more States. Our proposals are\r\nbased on a rigorous, broad, far-reaching and courageous\r\nvision. Our approach is not directed against anybody; it\r\nis directed towards the good of the total membership of\r\nthe United Nations, not the good of just a few Members.\r\nIn short, I recall once again what I said last year: we are\r\nfor the participation of all and for the exclusion of none.\r\nMr. Campbell (Ireland): This debate on the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\ngives us an opportunity to review themes affecting our\r\nwork over the past year and the extent to which the\r\nOrganization is adapting to meet new challenges. I want\r\nto express the Irish delegation’s thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report and for the way in which he\r\npresented it personally to this Assembly at the outset of\r\nour work. It is his first in office, as he himself points out,\r\nand it marks a change in the emphasis that it gives to the\r\ninterpretation of events and the particular needs which\r\nthey foreshadow.\r\nThe report is much shorter than recent versions and\r\ninevitably is a less complete record of the myriad\r\nactivities of the Organization. But in terms of readability\r\nit gains greatly, and whereas the earlier format acted as a\r\nuseful source of reference, it served less easily for a\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\ndebate among Member States, which must focus on the\r\nbroad picture of dominant trends and priorities for action.\r\nThe report underlines the essential role of multilateral\r\ndiplomacy in a world of rapid and often unpredictable\r\nchange. No emphasis on multilateralism can be too strong\r\nat a time when faith in its virtues is questioned in important\r\nquarters. Globalization, and the multitude of interlinking\r\ndependencies which come with it, only serves to reinforce\r\nthis reality. The Secretary-General’s analysis of the\r\nimmense benefits, but also the problems, that accompany\r\nglobalization offers a clear call to reaffirm our faith in\r\nmultilateralism and our determination to uphold it. In this\r\nprocess the United Nations and the United Nations system\r\nhold a central place.\r\nThe report rightly places great emphasis on good\r\ngovernance, human rights and democratization in the work\r\nof the Organization. It is now possible, as the report claims,\r\nto approach human rights in practical as well as principled\r\nterms from a truly global perspective.\r\nEqually, the place of development is properly given\r\ncentral emphasis in the report’s overview. The fifty-first\r\nsession of the General Assembly saw the adoption of An\r\nAgenda for Development. That was a hard won, but not\r\ninsignificant, achievement. In reviewing development issues\r\nacross the board, the Secretary-General notes that the\r\nUnited Nations development organizations face enormous\r\nchallenges with very limited resources, and enhanced\r\nsupport is necessary.\r\nThe resources, he points out, that are available to the\r\nUnited Nations, and to intergovernmental organizations\r\ngenerally, are declining relative to the scale of the problems\r\nwhich they face and to the capacity of other actors, notably\r\nin the private sector.\r\nAt the same time, the control of Governments over\r\nmany international developments, financial or other, is less\r\ncomplete than previously. The Secretary-General hardly\r\nexaggerates in describing the nineteenth special session of\r\nthe General Assembly, held last summer to review the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, as a “sober reflection”\r\n[A/52/1, para. 45] on the limited progress achieved since\r\nRio.\r\nThe Secretary-General is right in seeing this situation\r\nas one which does not allow the United Nations to stand\r\nstill or to advance simply through incremental adaptation.\r\nThe report makes a clear case for a process of fundamental\r\nreform, and it is his emphasis on this theme, running as a\r\nthread through the account of all aspects of the\r\nOrganization’s work, that gives the report its particular\r\ncoherence and force.\r\nMy Government has strongly backed the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in this approach, and we pay tribute to the clear\r\nand persuasive manner in which he has presented it. We\r\nhope that within the next few days the General Assembly\r\nwill give its unequivocal backing to the actions presented\r\nin his report on reform and that the same serious purpose\r\nwill lead to an early solution of the United Nations\r\nfinancial crisis caused by non-payment of dues.\r\nResolution 51/241, adopted at the fifty-first session\r\nof the General Assembly, contains a number of provisions\r\ndesigned to influence future versions of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. In many respects the report this year has\r\nalready anticipated these provisions in the clearer focus it\r\ngives to main themes and developments which need our\r\nattention. The resolution calls for a report that is more\r\neasily directed to assessing the way in which mandates of\r\nthe General Assembly have been fulfilled over the past\r\nyear and setting priorities for the period ahead in the\r\nmajor political, economic and social, administrative and\r\nfinancial areas.\r\nIt also calls for a specific section in the report\r\noutlining goals for the Secretariat in the year ahead in the\r\ncontext of the Organization’s work plan and taking into\r\naccount the medium-term plan.\r\nWe hope that this format will allow an even more\r\ncoherent and thought out reading of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report which embodies the overall sense of\r\npurpose and direction in the work of the Organization\r\nwhich he is uniquely qualified to give. The timing and\r\nassessment provisions foreseen would also add to the\r\naction-oriented thrust that it is hoped the report will\r\ncontinue to inspire in future years.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Allow me to express\r\nour thanks to the Secretary-General for his report,\r\ncontained in document A/52/1, providing us with a\r\nthematic overview of the activities of the Organization\r\nover the past year. The Secretary-General deserves our\r\nappreciation for the incisive analysis of the trends shaping\r\ntoday’s world and the vision he proposes to bring to bear\r\non the role of the United Nations in meeting the\r\nchallenges facing humanity.\r\nWe see the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nwork of the Organization as a statement of our collective\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nachievements as well as of our collective failures. We\r\nregard the report also as a guideline for the year ahead.\r\nThis year’s report, the first of the new Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, coincides with the renewed drive for\r\nreform of the Organization.\r\nMy delegation will be brief and will touch on two of\r\nthe main themes contained the report.\r\nThe first is international peace and security. We\r\nappreciate the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General in\r\nrespect of long-standing disputes and the objectivity with\r\nwhich he has interpreted the conflict situations. They point\r\nthe way for future action. The section on peacekeeping and\r\npost-conflict peace-building could be regarded as\r\ncomprehensive but for two elements. A brief overview of\r\nthe evolving nature of peacekeeping would have been\r\nuseful. Similarly, some of the highlights of the work of the\r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations could have\r\nbeen included in the report. The reporting on arms control\r\nand disarmament lacks comprehensiveness. There is little\r\nfocus on the regional imperatives and efforts. Although the\r\nperspective of peace and security finds a mention, the\r\nlinkage between disarmament and development has not\r\nbeen articulated. The intention to bring disarmament to\r\ncentre stage of the United Nations agenda will be\r\nmeaningful only when it is placed in the perspective of the\r\ntwin objectives of reducing of both military and non-\r\nmilitary threats to peace and security.\r\nThe second is development. A conscious effort at\r\ncomprehensive reporting is manifest in this section. We are\r\nhappy that the Secretary-General considers it a core mission\r\nof the United Nations to facilitate the successful integration\r\nof currently marginalized countries as active participants in\r\nthe world economy. But this introductory pledge does not\r\nfind a concrete reflection in the thematic section. For\r\ninstance, there is not a single reference to the least\r\ndeveloped countries in the discussion. The absence of\r\nconspicuous reference to this most disadvantaged and\r\nmarginalized group of 48 countries is a matter of great\r\nconcern to us at a time when most of the objectives of the\r\nProgramme of Action for the least developed countries still\r\nremains to be achieved. The report does not seem to focus\r\non the implementation of the outcome of the 1990s cycle of\r\nmajor international conferences, except the World\r\nConference on Human Rights, the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development and the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat\r\nII). The imperative of brevity, if this was the case, should\r\nnot have been at the cost of the continued focus on the\r\nfollow-up of these major global conferences.\r\nIn this connection, we join the delegation of\r\nMalaysia in reiterating the request for inclusion of\r\ninformation on the status of implementation of resolutions\r\nand decisions of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are happy that the United Nations agencies,\r\nfunds and programmes are making increased and targeted\r\nefforts at development and promotion of human rights,\r\nparticularly extending assistance for strengthening or\r\nbuilding institutional capacities of Member States. In this\r\nconnection, I wish to mention that Bangladesh has been\r\na beneficiary of assistance from the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme that has greatly facilitated work\r\ntowards the establishment of an independent National\r\nHuman Rights Commission. The assistance for\r\nstrengthening democratic institutions such as the Election\r\nCommission and the Parliament has also been deeply\r\nappreciated in my country.\r\nThe Charter places promotion of respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms in the context of\r\ninternational cooperation in solving problems of an\r\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character on\r\nthe basis of the principle of non-discrimination. We\r\nbelieve that human rights should be pursued in holistic\r\nterms and in their proper context. For decades, a partial\r\nand, hence, critically distorted approach — with an almost\r\nexclusive focus on civil and political rights — has failed\r\nthe cause. It is a matter of satisfaction to note that due\r\ncognizance has been taken of the 1993 Vienna\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action in the report. This\r\nassumes particular significance in the perspective of the\r\nongoing process of reform and restructuring. We are\r\nconfident that the new United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights will be able to make\r\nhistoric progress in the realization of human rights in their\r\ntotality and throughout the world.\r\nThe accomplishment of the reform is expected to\r\nenhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the\r\nOrganization. The Secretary-General has claimed our\r\nunanimous appreciation for presenting within a short\r\nperiod a comprehensive set of reforms, which have been\r\nunder consideration by the Assembly. The realization of\r\nthe objectives will, however, depend on the political will\r\nof the Member States, who will judge the performance by\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 10 November 1997\r\nultimate delivery. In the process, the will of the\r\ninternational community to have the United Nations\r\nfunction to its full potential will also become evident. We\r\nshould all act throughout the year in such a way as to have\r\na report next year that provides a statement of greater\r\nachievements, loftier vision and higher commitment.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin the debate on this item.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: We have thus concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 10.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n32\r\n"
