(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 14\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of the Agency (A/52/285)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.13)\r\nThe President: Exactly four decades have passed\r\nsince this special United Nations institution, the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, was established in\r\norder to\r\n“accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic\r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the\r\nworld”. [Statute of the IAEA, article II]\r\nOver the years, the Agency has provided assistance to\r\nMember States in developing the peaceful application of\r\nnuclear technology. It has also played an important role in\r\nsetting international standards and rules for ensuring nuclear\r\nsafety, in promoting international cooperation in the use of\r\natomic energy for peaceful purposes and in implementing\r\nthe safeguards regime for the non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nIt is my sincere hope that the discussion of the annual\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency will\r\ncontribute to strengthening the support of the Member\r\nStates for the Agency’s activities.\r\nI now welcome the Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, Mr. Hans Blix, and\r\ninvite him to present the report of the Agency for the year\r\n1996.\r\nMr. Blix (International Atomic Energy Agency): The\r\nannual report of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) for 1996 is before the General Assembly. Let me\r\nbegin by noting that the year since I last reported to this\r\nAssembly has brought several significant results. In May,\r\nthe Agency’s Board of Governors approved a Model\r\nProtocol additional to safeguards agreements — a\r\nProtocol which will give added teeth to the Agency’s\r\nnuclear inspection system. In recent months, a new\r\nConvention on the safe management of radioactive wastes\r\nand spent nuclear fuel has been adopted and, in the area\r\nof liability for nuclear accidents, existing conventions and\r\nrules have been modernized and compensation amounts\r\nvastly increased. This year has thus seen a significant\r\nstrengthening of the international legal infrastructure for\r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nThis year, the Agency has also, as the President just\r\nnoted, been celebrating its fortieth anniversary. Under its\r\nmandate, which was built on President Eisenhower’s\r\n“Atoms for Peace” initiative, the Agency has two main\r\nfunctions: to enlarge the contribution of nuclear energy to\r\npeace, health and prosperity throughout the world; and to\r\nverify that programmes and facilities declared to be for\r\npeaceful purposes are peaceful.\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nOver the years, this dual mandate of the IAEA has\r\nbecome increasingly important and relevant to the interests\r\nof member States. As the global use of nuclear techniques\r\nhas spread and grown, the volume of work of the Agency\r\nhas grown and new tasks have been laid upon it. Some of\r\nthese relate to verification. Others deal with safety.\r\nAlthough nuclear power is the most visible — and, in many\r\nplaces, controversial — use of nuclear energy, the vast\r\nmajority of other uses are non-controversial and of great\r\npractical importance, as in medicine, agriculture, industry\r\nand environment.\r\nThe IAEA currently spends about $50 million annually\r\nhelping member States use nuclear technology for their\r\ndevelopment needs by providing training, expert services\r\nand equipment. In the early years, the focus was on the\r\nbuilding of capacity in the area of nuclear science and\r\ntechnology. As such capacity has developed in many\r\nrecipient States, often with crucial assistance from the\r\nIAEA, the emphasis has shifted to employing those national\r\ncapacities, for instance, to prevent, diagnose and treat\r\ncancer, to help increase agricultural production or to\r\nprovide clean water supplies. The Agency’s technical\r\ncooperation programme and projects are thus geared to\r\ncontributing very directly to the implementation of Agenda\r\n21. Let me give only two examples from some 1000\r\nassistance projects implemented annually by the IAEA.\r\nIn Africa, the Agency, together with the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), has\r\nhelped to eliminate rinderpest, a disease which has claimed\r\nthe lives of millions of cattle. Out of 18 African countries\r\nwhere cattle had been infested, today only two show signs\r\nof the disease. Vital to this good result was the\r\nincorporation of nuclear-based diagnostic and monitoring\r\ntechniques in a pan-African campaign launched in 1987.\r\nThe second example, the provision of freshwater\r\nresources, is an issue of major concern in many parts of the\r\nworld. The use of nuclear techniques in the study of\r\nunderground water supplies helps improve the management\r\nof these valuable resources. We are currently collaborating\r\nin this area with as many as 40 countries. For example,\r\nAgency collaboration with Venezuelan experts has resulted\r\nin the mapping of underground waters in the area of\r\nCaracas, and a strategy has been developed for the\r\nprotection and sustainable use of these water resources. In\r\nNorth Africa and elsewhere, vast aquifers lie in arid and\r\nsemi-arid regions and can be a uniquely valuable resource.\r\nHowever, these aquifers are vulnerable to overexploitation\r\nand pollution, and the Agency has provided assistance to\r\nuse isotopes to determine sustainable levels of use of the\r\nwaters and to protect them from pollution.\r\nLet me mention further that the IAEA and the World\r\nMeteorological Organization have established the Global\r\nNetwork for Isotopes in Precipitation, which has been\r\nproviding over the last 35 years the basic isotopic data\r\nnecessary for applications of isotope techniques to the\r\nassessment of water resources in member States. There\r\nseems to be a consensus within the scientific community\r\nthat the operation of this Global Network and the use of\r\nits database are essential in studying past and current\r\nclimate change, including investigations related to the\r\ncurrent El Niño event and the resulting worldwide\r\nchanges of the weather pattern.\r\nRegrettably, financial resources for development\r\nprojects are under pressure everywhere. I must therefore\r\nunderline that continued and adequate support from all\r\nmember States for the Agency’s technical cooperation\r\nprogramme is indispensable if one is to realize the “atoms\r\nfor peace” vision, which is the dual quest to prevent the\r\nspread of a military use of nuclear technology and to\r\nfacilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful\r\npurposes.\r\nI turn now to the IAEA’s work on nuclear power.\r\nDuring the first two decades of the IAEA, there was great\r\noptimism in the world about the future use of nuclear\r\npower, particularly because of its capacity to compete\r\nwith and reduce dependence on oil. However, in the last\r\ntwo decades several factors have led to a stagnation in\r\nnuclear-power construction in most industrialized\r\ncountries: overcapacity in electricity generation in some\r\ncountries, concern about nuclear accidents, concern about\r\nthe management of nuclear waste and, lastly, the use of\r\ngas in combined cycle, which has emerged as an\r\neconomically very attractive option for the generation of\r\nheat and electricity in many countries.\r\nThe IAEA is not urging any country to turn to\r\nnuclear power. The choice of energy sources and energy\r\nmix is the sovereign prerogative of each State. However,\r\nthe Agency does perform work in several sectors which\r\nmay make nuclear power more attractive and economical\r\nfor those who opt for it.\r\nFirst, the most time-honoured and traditional method\r\nis to help bring about the exchange of experience in the\r\nconstruction and operation of nuclear plants and in the\r\ndevelopment of new technologies for power generation,\r\nfuel production and waste management. This is still done\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\non a large scale through meetings and publications.\r\nThrough exchange of experience, nuclear technologies, like\r\nother technologies, evolve, leading to improved reliability,\r\nsafety and economy. Globally, nuclear power plants today\r\nhave reached an availability of nearly 80 per cent,\r\ncompared to 65 per cent in 1977. Unplanned outages are\r\ntoday on average below 5 per cent, which compares\r\nfavourably with fossil-fuel plants. The second-generation\r\nreactors, which are here today, build on the vast global\r\noperating experience of the last decades. Some radical\r\ninnovations in nuclear-reactor concepts are also being\r\nexplored and could be introduced in the future.\r\nSecondly, the Agency is pursuing and encouraging\r\ncomparisons between the nuclear-power option and other\r\nmethods of generating electricity — comparisons of cost\r\nand impact on life, health and environment. The other main\r\noptions examined are fossil fuels, hydropower and\r\nrenewables. Such studies are mostly undertaken in\r\ncollaboration with other international organizations, but\r\nsome case studies are also undertaken together with national\r\ninstitutes and energy ministries. And the purpose in all\r\nthese comparisons is to provide Governments with material\r\nto better assess the energy options available.\r\nThirdly, and most importantly, the Agency is\r\npromoting nuclear safety in the operation of nuclear plants\r\nas well as in waste management. Although the ultimate\r\nresponsibility for safety rests with the individual plant\r\noperator and the State, what has been termed “an\r\ninternational nuclear-safety culture” has been evolving in\r\nthe last 10 years, with the IAEA as an active promoter.\r\nAfter Chernobyl, it was said that “an accident anywhere is\r\nan accident everywhere”. That globalized concern has been\r\nmet by a number of globalized responses, including new\r\nrules and extensive services by the IAEA to provide a basis\r\nfor safety improvements. The services have included a\r\nsystematic mapping of the shortcomings of several types of\r\nreactors from the Soviet era and the preparation of periodic\r\nsafety reviews about all types of reactors.\r\nFor a very long time the IAEA has been codifying\r\nbest nuclear-safety practices and has produced a\r\ncomprehensive set of safety standards for nuclear power\r\nplants and for radioactive-waste disposal. Although formally\r\nnon-binding, these standards have had considerable\r\ninfluence in member States. Sometimes they have even\r\nbeen directly adopted by member States. In the wake of the\r\nChernobyl accident, steps have been taken to supplement\r\nthese standards with binding international rules. Last year\r\na Convention on the safety of nuclear installations entered\r\ninto force, and over 40 States are now party to it. Secondly,\r\nin September this year a Joint Convention on the Safety\r\nof Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive\r\nWaste Management was adopted. It has now been signed\r\nby over 20 States. Both these conventions provide\r\nprocedures for peer review among parties in order to\r\npromote full implementation of the rules. Also in\r\nSeptember this year, new rules were adopted concerning\r\nthe liability for nuclear damage, as I mentioned. Years of\r\ncomplex negotiations resulted in a revision of the Vienna\r\nConvention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and a\r\nConvention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear\r\nDamage.\r\nIn his reform proposals the Secretary-General, noting\r\nthat there is no United Nations organization devoted to\r\nenergy generally, raises the question whether some focal\r\npoint should be indicated. A forum for a dispassionate\r\nexamination of the issue of energy in sustainable\r\ndevelopment might indeed be needed. The IAEA seems\r\ncurrently to be the only place in the United Nations\r\nsystem where the benefits of nuclear power as an energy\r\nsource economically roughly competitive with coal — but\r\nfree of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide\r\nemissions — is explicitly referred to by Governments.\r\nDuring the recent session of the IAEA’s General\r\nConference, several Member States and the European\r\nCommission pointed to the relevance of carbon-dioxide-\r\nfree nuclear power in the context of the threat of global\r\nwarming. Only the Agency’s host country explicitly went\r\non record with the opposite view. Let me cite some of the\r\nstatements.\r\nThe representative of Japan said,\r\n“In our view, nuclear power will play an\r\nimportant role in response to the question of global\r\nwarming. Provided that its safety is ensured, we look\r\nto nuclear power as a realistic energy option, as it\r\nexcels in supply stability and offers low\r\nenvironmental impact free from greenhouse-gas\r\nemissions.”\r\nThe representative of the United States, Secretary of\r\nEnergy Federico Peña, said,\r\n“It is essential that we remain capable of\r\nensuring the safety of our nuclear reactors. With\r\npopulations and standards of living increasing\r\naround the globe, nuclear energy could play a\r\npotentially significant role — helping the world meet\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nan ever increasing demand for energy while also\r\nhelping to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.”\r\nThe representative of the Republic of Korea said at\r\nour General Conference:\r\n“Korea firmly believes that nuclear energy will\r\nbe one of the most sustainable sources of energy in\r\nthe future, given the current situation in the global\r\nenvironment.”\r\nThe representative of Canada said:\r\n“Nuclear energy is a safe, environmentally sound\r\nand cost-effective source of energy. Canada is a firm\r\nsupporter of the nuclear-energy option, which is an\r\nimportant component of a sustainable energy-supply\r\nmix for many countries. Among its many advantages,\r\nnuclear power significantly reduces emissions of\r\ngreenhouse and other noxious gases that otherwise\r\nwould have been emitted to the detriment of the\r\nenvironment and of human health.”\r\nThe representative of France referred to\r\n“the advantages of nuclear power in meeting\r\nincreasing world demand for energy that does not\r\nproduce greenhouse gases”.\r\nThe representative of the European Commission said,\r\nlastly:\r\n“With a view to the forthcoming Kyoto Conference on\r\nClimate Change, I should like to emphasize that the\r\nrole of nuclear energy is important in addressing this\r\nserious problem. For Europe as a whole, use of\r\nnuclear energy is already avoiding the emission of\r\nsome 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.”\r\nThese recent statements reflect a strong commitment\r\nto nuclear safety and an understanding that nuclear power\r\nhas an important potential role to play in providing a\r\nsignificant portion of the world’s electricity without\r\nenvironmental damage. They are indeed in line with what\r\nwas said in the Declaration of the G-8 Summit in Moscow\r\non nuclear safety and security in 1996, that\r\n“we are committed to measures which will enable\r\nnuclear power, already a significant contributor to\r\nelectricity supply in those countries choosing to use it,\r\nto continue in the next century to play an important\r\nrole in meeting future world energy demand in\r\naccordance with the goal of sustainable development\r\nagreed at the Rio Conference in 1992.” [A/51/131,\r\np. 3]\r\nIt is also worth pointing out in this context, as was\r\nrecently done in a report to the President of the United\r\nStates, that if the some 430 nuclear-power plants in the\r\nworld were closed today and the electricity they produce\r\nwere\r\n“generated instead by coal, world carbon dioxide\r\nemissions from fossil fuel consumption would be\r\nalmost 10 percent larger than they currently are”.\r\nI have cited extensively on the capability of nuclear\r\npower to help us avoid carbon dioxide emissions because\r\nin various forums and secretariats of the United Nations\r\nsystem — focusing more on environment than on the\r\nneed for energy — concerns about safety and waste have\r\ntended to overshadow these environmentally benign sides\r\nin nuclear power. For instance, during the special session\r\nof the General Assembly last June, I was the only speaker\r\nto mention the potential of nuclear power to help restrain\r\ncarbon dioxide emissions. My personal conviction is that,\r\nwith the development of an international nuclear-safety\r\nculture, the real risks in an expanded use of nuclear\r\npower — rather than the widely perceived risks — can be\r\nkept very low. And without belittling the value and\r\npotential of energy savings and of an expanded use of\r\nsolar and wind power and biomass, I am also convinced\r\nthat in the intensifying search for energy sources which\r\nproduce little or no greenhouse gases, more Governments\r\nand broad segments of the general public will rediscover\r\nthe nuclear power option.\r\nAn expanded use of nuclear power in technologically\r\nadvanced countries could offer considerable alleviation in\r\ncarbon dioxide emissions. While this is well understood\r\nby many Governments — as the quotations I have cited\r\nshow — Governments have not yet generally been ready\r\nto act on this knowledge. Meanwhile, in my view, it is\r\nthe duty of the IAEA to seek, together with other\r\ninternational organizations, impartially and objectively to\r\ncompile and analyse all relevant data on the different\r\nenergy sources on a comparative basis to enable Member\r\nStates to make their assessments and to shape their\r\npolicies in as well-informed a manner as possible.\r\nI turn now to the other main function of the IAEA:\r\nnuclear verification and safeguards. In the early days of\r\nthe IAEA, verification was a relatively small-scale\r\nactivity. Today, our Safeguards Department is budgeted\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nat some $80 million a year and has some 600 staff, of\r\nwhich some 200 are inspectors. For economy and for\r\neffectiveness we have permanent regional safeguards offices\r\nin Toronto, for North and Central America, and in Tokyo,\r\nfor Japan and the Far East region. Moreover, we have\r\nseveral inspectors stationed on a continuous basis in\r\nBaghdad and in Nyongbyon to perform the inspections\r\nrequested by the Security Council. With the growth of\r\nnuclear power and the increased adherence to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), more\r\nnuclear material and installations are verified by the IAEA.\r\nAt the end of 1996, Agency safeguards were being applied\r\nto more than 154,000 tonnes of nuclear material. This is\r\nsome 43 per cent more than five years earlier. Of this\r\nmaterial, 74 tonnes were unirradiated plutonium or highly\r\nenriched uranium.\r\nIn a moment, I shall explain how nuclear disarmament\r\nmeasures may call for IAEA verification. At this point, it\r\nmay be noted that the further nuclear disarmament\r\nproceeds, the stronger the interest will be in verifying that\r\nnon-proliferation commitments are respected.\r\nThe importance of IAEA safeguards has been noted by\r\nthe Security Council. In 1992, after a meeting held at the\r\nlevel of Heads of State or Government, the President of the\r\nCouncil made a statement as follows:\r\n“The proliferation of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction constitutes a threat to international peace\r\nand security. The members of the Council commit\r\nthemselves to working to prevent the spread of\r\ntechnology related to the research for or production of\r\nsuch weapons and to take appropriate action to that\r\nend.\r\n“On nuclear proliferation, they note the\r\nimportance of the decision of many countries to\r\nadhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and emphasize\r\nthe integral role in the implementation of that Treaty\r\nof fully effective IAEA safeguards, as well as the\r\nimportance of effective export controls. The members\r\nof the Council will take appropriate measures in the\r\ncase of any violations notified to them by the IAEA.”\r\n[S/PV.3046, p. 145]\r\nFor several years now, the Director General of the\r\nIAEA has annually briefed the Security Council on the\r\nIAEA’s verification work.\r\nAs I said in my introduction, major steps are being\r\ntaken to increase the capability of the IAEA safeguards\r\nsystem to detect any undeclared nuclear installations and\r\nmaterial. The discovery, during IAEA inspections in Iraq\r\nin 1991, that Iraq — a party to the NPT and to a\r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA —\r\nhad been able, undetected, to pursue a secret programme\r\nfor the enrichment of uranium and weaponization,\r\nshocked the world. It convinced IAEA member States that\r\nthe safeguards system would have to be strengthened.\r\nConsiderable efforts to this end have been made by the\r\nIAEA, drawing on the inspection experiences in Iraq, in\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and in South\r\nAfrica, where the Agency was asked by the Government\r\nto verify the dismantling of its nuclear weapons.\r\nNew safeguards measures have been worked out\r\nwhich fall into four categories: first, access to more\r\nnuclear-related information; secondly, much greater access\r\nfor inspectors to relevant sites; thirdly, the use of new\r\ndetection techniques, such as environmental sampling; and\r\nfourthly, introduction of measures to facilitate operations\r\nand reduce costs.\r\nMany of the new measures have already been\r\nintroduced, as authority for them could be found in\r\nexisting safeguards agreements. Those measures which\r\nrequired new authority have been incorporated in a Model\r\nProtocol additional to the existing safeguards agreements.\r\nI am pleased to report to the General Assembly that in\r\nMay of this year, the Model Protocol was adopted by\r\nconsensus by the Agency’s Board of Governors and a\r\nnumber of States have already signed it. The sooner this\r\nProtocol is broadly accepted, the sooner the benefits of\r\nmore effective verification and more cost-efficient\r\nverification methods will be felt.\r\nThere is no doubt that a higher degree of assurance\r\nabout the absence of undeclared nuclear material and\r\ninstallations can be given for States which accept the\r\nadditional protocol and the new safeguards measures.\r\nStates which are anxious to have the best possible non-\r\nproliferation credentials should therefore see in the\r\nacceptance of the Model Protocol a means to further this\r\naim. However, I must at the same time caution against\r\nany expectation that assurance of detection could ever get\r\nto 100 per cent. It may well be desirable in the future to\r\ndevise an even more fine-meshed verification system than\r\nthe one now emerging. Technical innovations, growing\r\nfamiliarity with inspection and acceptance of extensive\r\nverification by all States, including the declared nuclear-\r\nweapon States, may make this possible in future. At this\r\njuncture, such a system would be more intrusive and\r\nexpensive than would be acceptable to States.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nLastly, it is important for Governments, media and the\r\npublic to be aware that no inspection system can give what\r\nis called “a clean bill of health”. The inspecting authority,\r\nlike a medical doctor, performs an examination and may\r\nreport that there is “no indication of ill-health”. To prove\r\nthe total absence in a State of any “unhealthy” elements is\r\nbeyond the ability of any inspectorate. It is thus necessary\r\nfor Governments to judge, in the light of the thoroughness\r\nof the inspections undertaken and all other relevant\r\ncircumstances, whether they will take a report that no\r\nindication has been found of any undeclared nuclear activity\r\nto mean that there is none.\r\nWhat I have said about safeguards verification\r\ngenerally is also relevant to the IAEA’s work under the\r\nSecurity Council mandate in Iraq, even though the\r\ninvestigations of nuclear activities there are based on\r\nexceptionally far-reaching inspection rights and have been\r\ngoing on since 1991. I recently submitted to the Security\r\nCouncil a comprehensive report providing an overview of\r\nthe Agency’s activities in Iraq over the past six years\r\n[S/1997/779, appendix]. After extensive work involving\r\ninspections, analysis of large volumes of documentation and\r\nof information received from Member States and former\r\nsuppliers of relevant items, the use of new techniques for\r\nenvironmental monitoring, questioning of Iraqi staff and\r\nexamination of items recovered from excavations, we have\r\nbeen able to construct a technically coherent picture of\r\nIraq’s past nuclear programme and to gain a good\r\nunderstanding of the scope of the achievements of the\r\nprogramme. Assessment of Iraq’s reissued “Full, Final and\r\nComplete Declaration” against this coherent picture has not\r\nshown any substantial inconsistencies between the two.\r\nHowever, especially in the face of Iraq’s past practice of\r\nconcealment, it is not possible to guarantee that the picture\r\nis complete or that there could not still be some concealed\r\ncomponents, activities and facilities, which did not form\r\npart of the technically coherent picture. As I have reported\r\npreviously, the Agency has ensured the destruction, removal\r\nor rendering harmless of all discovered proscribed items\r\nand has placed dual-use items under monitoring.\r\nThe Agency has been much concerned about Iraq’s\r\nrefusal to facilitate the use by IAEA and the United Nations\r\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM) of fixed-wing aircraft to\r\ntransport personnel and equipment within Iraq. We have\r\nbeen even more concerned about the recent attempt by Iraq\r\nto limit the free choice of inspectors. We must be aware\r\nthat any refusal of access could be caused by an interest to\r\nconceal something. Such refusals therefore run counter to\r\nIraq’s efforts to convince the inspectors and the world that\r\nnothing is hidden.\r\nWhile still pursuing a number of questions relating\r\nto the past nuclear programme and retaining the right to\r\ncarry out further inspections if new information on the\r\npast programme comes to light, the Agency has been\r\ndeploying most of its resources to the ongoing monitoring\r\nand verification activities, to guard against the possibility\r\nthat Iraq might use its capabilities to exploit for nuclear-\r\nweapons purposes any relevant materials or technology to\r\nwhich it may gain access. In this regard, it must be\r\nrecognized that Iraq retains, in its core of scientists and\r\nengineers, nuclear-weapons-related expertise and relevant\r\ndocumentation.\r\nIn the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the\r\nIAEA is asserting its right and duty to perform\r\ninspections under the safeguards agreement which remains\r\nin force. It needs to do so in order to verify the\r\ncompleteness and correctness of the initial declaration\r\nmade by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in\r\n1993. At the same time, the Agency is verifying a freeze\r\nof the nuclear programme of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, as requested by the Security Council.\r\nI regret to report that no progress has been made in\r\ntechnical discussions with the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, notably on the preservation of\r\ninformation related to past nuclear activities and on\r\nverifying that there are no movements or operations\r\ninvolving nuclear liquid wastes from the reprocessing\r\nplant under the freeze. On the positive side, let me\r\nmention that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nhas accepted the designation of additional inspectors,\r\nwhich will help to maintain our continuous presence in\r\nthe Nyongbyon area, and that the canning operation for\r\nthe irradiated fuel rods from the five-megawatt reactor is\r\nalmost complete and that the cans are placed under IAEA\r\nmonitoring. It would seem that it should be in the interest\r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to\r\ncooperate fully with the IAEA without further delay, as\r\nthe Agency must complete verifying compliance by the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea with its\r\nsafeguards obligations before any sensitive components\r\nare delivered to the light-water reactors now about to be\r\nconstructed. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nremains in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations.\r\nNon-proliferation is strengthened by an increasing\r\nnumber of nuclear-weapon-free zones. Such zones may\r\ncontain features that respond to particular needs or are of\r\nspecial importance to the group of States constituting a\r\nzone. Their composition may also be of importance to\r\nprovide desired confidence.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nThe issue of a nuclear-weapon-free zone for the\r\nMiddle East has been on the agenda of the United Nations\r\nfor many years. The safeguards aspects have been the\r\nsubject of considerable attention in the IAEA. As requested\r\nby the General Conference of the IAEA, the Director\r\nGeneral’s consultations with countries in the region have\r\nfocused on the possibility of combining international NPT-\r\ntype safeguards with regional or bilateral means of\r\nverification, a subject that has also been explored, most\r\nrecently in May this year at a second IAEA workshop on\r\nsuch verification issues.\r\nLet me turn now to some tasks which Governments\r\nhave recently laid upon the Agency, or may place on the\r\nAgency in the not very distant future. In 1996, during the\r\nIAEA General Conference, an arrangement was made\r\namong the representatives of the United States of America,\r\nof the Russian Federation and of the IAEA to examine the\r\nmodalities of possible Agency verification that nuclear\r\nmaterial transferred out of the defence sector in the United\r\nStates and Russia, notably material from dismantled nuclear\r\nweapons, is stored or is used for peaceful purposes. I need\r\nnot remind anybody that the quantities of plutonium and\r\nhighly enriched uranium that would come under verification\r\nare large. Extensive exploratory discussions have taken\r\nplace during the past year to clarify the complex issues\r\narising in what really would be a first scheme for\r\ninternational verification of nuclear disarmament. It was\r\nagreed during the recent General Conference of the IAEA\r\nthat these discussions would continue.\r\nNo progress has yet been made in Geneva on the\r\nproposal for a cut-off agreement to stop all production of\r\nfissile material for weapons purposes. It is to be hoped that\r\nprogress will soon be made in this area. The combination\r\nof verification of the storage or peaceful use of fissile\r\nmaterial released from weapons and a cut-off agreement\r\nwould give the world confidence that no fresh material\r\ncould go into new weapons.\r\nIn recent years, many criminal attempts have been\r\nmade to smuggle and sell small quantities of nuclear\r\nmaterial and radioactive sources. This has raised both health\r\nand proliferation concerns, and has led to countermeasures\r\nby Governments as agreed at the Moscow Nuclear Summit\r\nin 1996. The IAEA has developed a programme which\r\nseeks to supplement the action of Governments and to\r\ncoordinate a variety of measures directed at the problem. In\r\nsome States, the Agency is offering advice on appropriate\r\nlegislation, standards of physical protection and\r\nadministrative machinery. In others, it has provided\r\ntraining. The Agency has also developed a database of all\r\nknown cases of trafficking and has followed up media\r\nreports by contacts with official authorities. Efforts to\r\ncounter nuclear trafficking must continue. We might also\r\nneed to review the adequacy of the international\r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear\r\nMaterial, which now deals with nuclear material in\r\ninternational transit.\r\nLet me finally mention, in this section about the\r\nbelligerent atom, that the IAEA has been called on\r\nincreasingly to assess to what extent, if any, former\r\nnuclear-weapons test sites pose radiological hazards. Now\r\nthat the era of such tests is hopefully over, such\r\nassessments seem particularly appropriate. The Agency\r\nhas organized international expert teams to perform such\r\nassessments at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, at Bikini in\r\nthe Marshall Islands and at Mururoa and Fangataufa in\r\nFrench Polynesia. These assessments must, of course, be\r\nread in all their details. However, the overall impression\r\nis that the radiological legacy of the testing era on the\r\nsites examined is fortunately not alarming.\r\nThis is the last time I shall have the honour to report\r\nto the General Assembly on the work of the IAEA, and\r\nI should like to say before concluding that my elected\r\nsuccessor, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, will take up his\r\nfunctions as Director General of the IAEA after a long\r\nand distinguished career at the Agency. He has been\r\nengaged in some of the most difficult questions facing the\r\nAgency during my time and he has often contributed\r\ndecisively to their resolution.\r\nPerhaps I may conclude this statement on a personal\r\nnote. The first General Assembly session which I\r\nattended, as a Swedish representative in the Sixth\r\nCommittee, was that of 1961, and I have visited all\r\nsessions since then. Despite the frequent and sometimes\r\njustified criticism of the United Nations and its family of\r\norganizations, I have always felt it was a tremendous\r\nprivilege to participate in this multilateral work, whether\r\nin the United Nations or at the IAEA, whether as a\r\ndiplomat or as an international official, whether helping\r\nto draft international norms, working on arms control or\r\ndisarmament questions, or dealing with development.\r\nDespite the ups and downs of this work, not to speak of\r\nthe slow pace at which it often proceeds, there is often a\r\nvery satisfactory feeling that helping, in however modest\r\na way, to weave the fabric of a global community is\r\nmeaningful. I think this feeling is also the most important\r\ndriving force in the highly competent staff which has\r\nworked with me in Vienna these past 16 years and which\r\nhas succeeded in maintaining and developing the IAEA as\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nan effective mechanism responsive to the needs of Member\r\nStates.\r\nIn ending this statement, I shall not fail to express my\r\nthanks on behalf of the IAEA and on my own behalf to the\r\nGovernment of Austria, which has invariably been an\r\nexcellent host to the IAEA and to other Vienna-based\r\norganizations. I also thank the General Assembly for the\r\nkind attention with which it has listened to my reports over\r\nthe years.\r\nThe President: I thank the Director General for his\r\nintroduction of the report of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, and I would like to commend him for his\r\ndedicated service to the international community, to the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and to the United\r\nNations. I wish him great success in his future endeavours.\r\nI now call on the Permanent Representative of Japan\r\nto introduce draft resolution A/52/L.13.\r\nMr. Owada (Japan): My delegation would like to\r\nthank the Director General of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Hans Blix, for his\r\ncomprehensive introduction of the Agency’s report to the\r\nAssembly.\r\nAs Mr. Blix will be retiring shortly, I should like to\r\ntake this opportunity at the outset to express, on behalf of\r\nmy delegation and on my personal behalf, wholehearted\r\ngratitude to him for his dedicated service to the Agency\r\nover the past 16 years. On a personal note, if I may, it is\r\nby a coincidence of history that I have the honour, on\r\nbehalf of the sponsors and in my official capacity as\r\nPermanent Representative of Japan, to introduce this draft\r\nresolution on the question of the report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency. But, at the same time, in my\r\npersonal capacity, I am pleased to have this honour as a\r\npersonal friend of Mr. Blix over the last 40 years. During\r\nhis tenure of office, thanks to his outstanding leadership\r\nand his remarkable managerial skill, the Agency has\r\ndeveloped into an international body of exemplary\r\neffectiveness and efficiency, faithfully fulfilling the\r\nobjectives and principles set out in the Agency’s statute.\r\nHis achievements in the fields of nuclear non-proliferation\r\nand nuclear energy use for peaceful purposes have been\r\nespecially laudable and will be long remembered.\r\nOn behalf of the sponsors, Japan is pleased to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.13 on the report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. The Agency\r\ncelebrated its fortieth anniversary this year. In addition to\r\nthis celebration, however, this year has marked a number\r\nof significant achievements by the Agency. Permit me to\r\ndraw your attention to some of them which are reflected\r\nin this year’s draft resolution.\r\nOne of the Agency’s most outstanding\r\naccomplishments is in the area of safeguards. Since 1992,\r\nthe IAEA Board of Governors has had intensive\r\ndiscussions on strengthening the effectiveness and\r\nimproving the efficiency of the safeguards system with a\r\nview to detecting undeclared nuclear activities.\r\nDeliberations on this matter culminated successfully in the\r\nadoption of the Model Additional Protocol in May 1997.\r\nAll concerned States and other parties to safeguards\r\nagreements are therefore requested to conclude the\r\nadditional protocols without delay.\r\nIn the area of nuclear safety, further codification was\r\nalso achieved in September 1997, in the form of three\r\ninstruments: the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent\r\nFuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste\r\nManagement; the Protocol to Amend the Vienna\r\nConvention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage; and,\r\nfinally, the Convention on Supplementary Compensation\r\nfor Nuclear Damage. These achievements are duly\r\nreflected in the draft resolution.\r\nThe technical cooperation activities of the Agency\r\ncontinue to play an important role in our efforts to\r\nachieve sustainable development in developing countries.\r\nThe Agency’s endeavours in the areas of isotope\r\nhydrology and potable water production continue to be\r\nnoteworthy in this regard.\r\nWith regard to the Agency’s implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions on Iraq, we note with great\r\nconcern that Iraq has not complied with all of the\r\nprovisions of these resolutions. It is therefore quite\r\nimportant that the Agency continue its strenuous efforts\r\nto fulfil its mandate to identify, destroy, remove or render\r\nharmless the relevant materials, installations and\r\nequipment.\r\nFinally, I should like to note that the draft resolution\r\nexpresses its appreciation for 16 years of distinguished\r\nservice by Mr. Hans Blix as Director General of the\r\nAgency, noting that he will retire soon with the\r\ndistinguished title of “Director General Emeritus of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”. It also extends its\r\nbest wishes to the incoming Director General of the\r\nIAEA, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nOn behalf of the sponsors of the draft resolution,\r\nwhich now include the Marshall Islands, Albania, Estonia\r\nand Latvia, in addition to the 44 States listed in document\r\nA/52/L.13 before the Assembly, Japan is pleased to put this\r\ndraft forward. My delegation believes that it reflects\r\naccurately the achievements of the Agency and represents\r\nthe results of our collaborative work with our friends in\r\nVienna and in New York to develop a text which can\r\nattract the greatest number of supporters. I sincerely hope\r\nthat this draft resolution will be adopted with the broadest\r\npossible support.\r\nMr. Wolzfeld (Luxembourg) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. The Central and Eastern European\r\ncountries associated with the European Union — Bulgaria,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia,\r\nas well as the associated country of Cyprus — associate\r\nthemselves with this statement. The European Free Trade\r\nAssociation (EFTA) country member of the European\r\nEconomic Area, Norway, also aligns itself with this\r\nstatement.\r\nToday we are considering agenda item 14, entitled\r\n“Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency”. May\r\nI begin by expressing the European Union’s gratitude for\r\nthe extraordinary work carried out by the Agency during\r\n1996 and the first part of 1997. This year’s consideration of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report is\r\na more solemn occasion than usual, first because we are\r\ncelebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Agency, the\r\nstatute of which dates from 1957, and secondly because\r\nMr. Hans Blix, the Agency’s current Director General, is\r\npassing the baton to his successor, Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, who will take office on 1 December 1997.\r\nWe again express our thanks to Mr. Blix, who is an\r\nold friend, and, through him, to all his staff for the\r\nremarkable work that has been accomplished over the past\r\n16 years. We express our sincere congratulations to\r\nMr. ElBaradei, a man of great experience, and take this\r\nopportunity to assure him of our full support in the\r\nfulfilment of his important functions.\r\nThe presentation of the annual report of the IAEA to\r\nthe General Assembly provides us with the opportunity to\r\nreview the Agency’s work and to measure its results in the\r\nvarious fields in which it carries out its statutory functions.\r\nThe European Union would like to comment on some of\r\nthese areas of activity which, in 1996 and 1997, developed\r\nin specific and generally positive ways.\r\nAs far as nuclear non-proliferation is concerned, the\r\nEuropean Union believes that all States must redouble\r\ntheir efforts to achieve three priority aims: the universality\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT), accession to the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the swift conclusion\r\nof negotiations on a universal, non-discriminatory\r\nconvention banning the production of fissile material for\r\nnuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,\r\nwhich is referred to as the cut-off convention.\r\nFor the European Union, the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains the cornerstone\r\nof the global non-proliferation regime. We again welcome\r\nBrazil’s declared intention to accede to it. We also\r\nwelcome the significant decisions taken at the 1995 NPT\r\nReview and Extension Conference with regard to the\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty, the principles and\r\nobjectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament\r\nand the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty.\r\nOn the basis of the generally very constructive\r\natmosphere in which work took place at the first session\r\nof the Preparatory Committee for the next NPT Review\r\nConference, to be held in the year 2000, the Union calls\r\non all States to join it in taking that work forward at the\r\nCommittee’s next session. The Union continues to urge\r\nworldwide accession to the NPT. It reiterates its call to\r\nthose States that have not yet done so, particularly those\r\namong them that operate nuclear facilities outside the\r\nIAEA safeguards system, to accede to the Treaty as soon\r\nas possible and without exception, and to conclude full-\r\nscope safeguards agreements with the IAEA.\r\nThe adoption and opening for signature in September\r\n1996 of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) was in conformity with the principles and\r\nobjectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament\r\nadopted at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension\r\nConference. This is the first of the measures in the\r\nprogramme of action, which will give full effect to the\r\nprovisions of article VI of the NPT. Whether the future\r\nOrganization will be set up within the time limits and in\r\nthe form specified in the Treaty will depend on the\r\ncontinued work of the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nCTBT Organization (CTBTO). The European Union\r\nattaches particular importance to universal accession to\r\nthe Treaty and therefore calls on all States that have not\r\nyet signed — especially those on the list of 44 States\r\nwhose ratification is needed for the Treaty to come into\r\nforce — to do so as quickly as possible. We expect the\r\ndevelopment of the closest possible collaboration on\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nadministrative and logistical matters between the IAEA and\r\nthe CTBTO once the latter has been set up.\r\nThe second measure under the action programme for\r\nimplementing article VI of the NPT contained in the\r\ndecision on principles and objectives concerns the early\r\nconclusion of a cut-off convention. The European Union\r\nagain stresses its desire for an immediate start to and a\r\nswift conclusion of negotiations on a non-discriminatory\r\nand universally applicable convention banning the\r\nproduction of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and\r\nother nuclear explosive devices. The European Union\r\ninvites the Conference on Disarmament to set up as soon as\r\npossible an ad hoc committee to deal with this issue, in\r\naccordance with the statement of the Special Coordinator of\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament and the mandate contained\r\ntherein. We regret that this has not been done to date.\r\nThe third measure in the programme of action for\r\nimplementing article VI of the NPT contained in the\r\ndecision on principles and objectives relates to the\r\ndetermined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of\r\nsystematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear\r\nweapons as a whole and eventually to eliminate them, and\r\nthe desire of all States to work for general and complete\r\ndisarmament under strict and effective international control.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the progress made in this\r\narea. The entry into force of the START I Treaty and the\r\nforthcoming ratification of START II, which will clear the\r\nway for negotiations to begin between the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Russian Federation on START III, as well\r\nas the considerable unilateral reductions that the United\r\nKingdom and France have undertaken to make in their\r\nnuclear arsenals, are all highly significant steps.\r\nFor the European Union, the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones based on arrangements freely arrived at\r\namong the States of the region concerned is a factor for\r\nenhancing global and regional stability. We regard such\r\nzones as important elements that complement the NPT. The\r\nUnion welcomes the zones established under the Treaties of\r\nTlatelolco, Pelindaba and Rarotonga, as well as the efforts\r\nbeing made to give full effect to the Treaty of Bangkok\r\nwith regard to a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South-East\r\nAsia. Furthermore, the Union has this year again signalled\r\nits interest in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone in South Asia. Similarly, it continues to support\r\nefforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the\r\nMiddle East and a zone free of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and of their delivery systems in that region. The\r\nUnion notes that today all the States in the region, with one\r\nexception, have become parties to the NPT. It recalls the\r\n1995 NPT Conference resolution calling upon all States\r\nin the Middle East that have not yet done so, without\r\nexception, to accede to the NPT as soon as possible and\r\nto make progress towards the establishment of such a\r\nzone.\r\nFurthermore, the European Union welcomes the\r\nadoption, on 15 May 1997 by the Board of Governors, of\r\nthe Model Protocol for the “93+2” programme. This\r\nprogramme aims to strengthen the effectiveness and\r\nimprove the efficiency of the safeguards system. It is\r\nintended to allow the detection of undeclared nuclear\r\nactivities and will significantly increase the Agency’s\r\nability to enhance significantly its knowledge of nuclear\r\nprogrammes under way. The European Union thanks\r\nAmbassador Peter Walker and his colleagues on the\r\nCommittee that the IAEA Board of Governors has\r\nentrusted with the task of drafting the Model Protocol for\r\ntheir speedy completion of their work. This Protocol is a\r\nmodel that opens up a new era in nuclear non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nThe European Union is determined to conclude an\r\nagreement on additional protocols with the IAEA in the\r\nnear future. We call on all the other member States of the\r\nIAEA to match the determination of the European Union\r\nand ensure that the new additional protocols soon become\r\na reality and are as universal as possible.\r\nWe wish to reiterate our conviction that nuclear\r\nexport-control measures play an important role in\r\npreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. The right of each State under article IV of the\r\nNPT to develop its research in and production and use of\r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes must be exercised in\r\nconformity with the non-proliferation obligations set out\r\nin articles I and II of the Treaty. The European Union,\r\nwhich has endorsed the IAEA’s guidelines in document\r\nINFCIRC/254, renews its appeal to all exporting countries\r\nthat have not yet done so to accept these guidelines and\r\nto establish effective national mechanisms for export\r\ncontrol. Such mechanisms fit into a broader framework of\r\nthe adoption of responsible policies concerning transfers\r\nof sensitive materials, including the introduction of\r\neffective systems of export control. Control measures,\r\nwhich are a necessary corollary of peaceful nuclear\r\ncooperation, should be encouraged within the framework\r\nof an ongoing, fruitful dialogue among all interested\r\nStates parties.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the programme for\r\npreventing and combating illicit trafficking in nuclear\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nmaterial adopted at the Moscow Nuclear Safety and\r\nSecurity Summit in April 1996, and awaits closer\r\ncooperation in the areas of prevention, detection, exchange\r\nof information, investigation and prosecution in cases of\r\nillicit trafficking. The European Union reiterates its appeal\r\nto all States to implement the programme. The Union\r\nwelcomes the Agency’s work in this area, particularly the\r\nfact that it has provided member States with a fully\r\noperational database, which is the authoritative source of\r\ninformation on incidents verified by member States, and\r\nthat it has established an International Physical Protection\r\nAdvisory Service to advise member States on how to\r\nimprove their national nuclear-safety systems.\r\nThe physical protection of nuclear material is one of\r\nthe key elements in the fight against illicit trafficking. The\r\nEuropean Union reiterates its appeal to States that have not\r\nyet done so to place all their nuclear material under an\r\neffective protection system, in accordance with international\r\nguidelines, and to become parties to the 1980 Vienna\r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.\r\nIn this connection, it welcomes the Republic of Cuba’s\r\nrecent decision to accede to that Convention. We further\r\nnote with satisfaction the work done by the parties\r\nconcerned on guidelines for the management of civil\r\nplutonium. This is a significant complement to the Moscow\r\nNuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and\r\neffective management of the fissile material of nuclear\r\nweapons identified as being no longer required for national\r\ndefence purposes.\r\nThe European Union recalls that it attaches particular\r\nimportance to the non-proliferation objectives of the Korean\r\nPeninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO).\r\nAfter deciding to provide initial assistance in the form of a\r\ncontribution of ECU 5 million to KEDO in March 1996,\r\nthe Union has sought ways of supporting it in a more\r\nlasting manner. The negotiations that were entered into with\r\nthe founding members of KEDO led to the conclusion of an\r\nagreement providing for an annual contribution by the\r\nUnion of up to ECU 15 million for a period of five years\r\nand European Union participation in the KEDO Executive\r\nBoard.\r\nThe European Union continues to be concerned at the\r\nshortcomings in the implementation of the IAEA’s\r\nagreement with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\non the application of safeguards in the framework of the\r\nNPT. Similarly, it continues to be deeply concerned by the\r\nfact that to date the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nhas not provided the Agency with the information it needs\r\nto verify that it has not diverted nuclear material to illicit\r\nuses and that its initial declaration is correct and\r\ncomplete. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s\r\nfailure to cooperate with the Agency is inconsistent with\r\nthe legal commitments to which that country subscribed\r\nin its agreement with the Agency on the application of\r\nsafeguards in the framework of the NPT.\r\nThe European Union again appeals urgently to the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to honour its\r\nsafeguards commitments and to cooperate fully with the\r\nDirector General of the IAEA. In this connection, as\r\nstated in the IAEA Director General’s communication of\r\n13 October 1997 to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, the European Union welcomes the holding of\r\ndiscussions between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the Agency in Vienna and hopes that those\r\ntalks will clear the way for a solution to the unresolved\r\nquestions.\r\nThe European Union also commends the Director\r\nGeneral of the Agency and his colleagues for their\r\nstrenuous efforts to implement Security Council\r\nresolutions 687 (1991), 707 (1991), 715 (1991) and 1051\r\n(1996) of 27 March 1996. We note that progress\r\ncontinues to be made in the review of the Full, Final and\r\nComplete Declaration Iraq is supposed to make on the\r\ndefinitive and complete status of its nuclear-weapon\r\nprogramme and that progress has also been made\r\nregarding the content and accuracy of Iraq’s six-monthly\r\ndeclarations under the Ongoing Monitoring and\r\nVerification Plan.\r\nWe note with concern, however, that Iraq has still\r\nnot provided the Agency’s Action Team with all the\r\ninformation it has requested, and we deplore Iraq’s refusal\r\nto allow the Agency to use an aeroplane in February\r\n1997. We call upon Iraq to cooperate fully with the\r\nAgency’s Action Team by responding to its requests for\r\ninformation and by fully implementing the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and the Ongoing Monitoring\r\nand Verification Plan.\r\nThe European Union again stresses Iraq’s obligation\r\nto hand over immediately to the Agency’s Action Team\r\nany nuclear-weapon-related equipment, material and\r\ninformation it may still possess and to allow the Action\r\nTeam immediate, unconditional and unrestricted right of\r\naccess, in accordance with Security Council resolution\r\n707 (1991). We stress that the IAEA Action Team will\r\ncontinue to exercise its rights under all relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and in connection with any further\r\nrelevant information that may come to light.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nThe Convention on Nuclear Safety entered into force\r\non 24 October 1996. While recognizing that the primary\r\nresponsibility for nuclear safety rests with the respective\r\nnational Governments, the European Union welcomes the\r\nentry into force of this Convention, which was concluded\r\nunder IAEA auspices and which will strengthen cooperation\r\nand mutual assistance in a favourable climate for the\r\ndevelopment a global nuclear-safety culture.\r\nThe preparatory meeting in April 1997 laid down the\r\nrules of procedure to be followed by the Contracting Parties\r\nat their periodic meetings to review the national reports.\r\nThose rules guarantee both an effective review of national\r\nreports and the transparency of the Contracting Parties’\r\nreview procedure. The preparatory meeting also set\r\nguidelines for the form and structure of national safety\r\nreports and laid down financial rules.\r\nThe European Union calls on all States that have not\r\nyet done so, and especially those with nuclear facilities, to\r\naccede to this Convention at the earliest possible date,\r\nwithout exception.\r\nThe Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel\r\nManagement and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste\r\nManagement, adopted by the Conference of\r\nPlenipotentiaries on 5 September 1997, is another major\r\nstep forward, from the standpoint both of the protection of\r\nhumankind and the environment and of its impact on the\r\npublic.\r\nThe European Union fully appreciates the fact that this\r\nConvention deals not only with the safe management of\r\nradioactive waste but also with the safe management of\r\nspent fuel, in a single joint legal instrument.\r\nThe European Union is convinced that the obligations\r\nembodied in this Convention reflect a culture of nuclear\r\nsafety that is both responsible and of a high order.\r\nLikewise, the fact that the Convention also devotes a\r\nseparate article to cross-border movements of nuclear\r\nmaterials is another noteworthy achievement.\r\nIt is the great hope of the European Union that the\r\nIAEA member States will regard the ratification or\r\nacceptance of this Convention as having at least the same\r\nimportance and urgency as did the Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the outcome of the\r\nConference of Plenipotentiaries held in Vienna from 8 to 12\r\nSeptember 1997, which adopted the Protocol to Amend the\r\nVienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage\r\nand the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for\r\nNuclear Damage.\r\nThe European Union has always been a driving force\r\nin the field of nuclear technological cooperation, at the\r\nmultilateral and bilateral levels, and has given priority to\r\ncooperation with developing countries. Those countries\r\nwill thus be able to benefit from nuclear technology\r\napplications, be it in the area of agriculture, epidemiology,\r\nindustry, health or research, and such cooperation will\r\ncontribute to their general development. The European\r\nUnion approves in particular of the pilot projects that\r\nform part of the Agency’s technical cooperation\r\nprogramme.\r\nWe applaud the fact that the Agency’s cooperation\r\nprojects are implemented with the greatest concern to\r\nmeet high standards of quality and efficiency. We would\r\ncall on all Member States and on the Agency itself to see\r\nto it that each one, according to its own means and\r\ncapabilities, maintains or strengthens the current impetus.\r\nThe Nuclear Suppliers Group plays a key role in\r\nformulating directives on the export of nuclear or dual-use\r\nmaterials, equipment and technologies in the context of\r\nthe development of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. To\r\ndemonstrate its unequivocal commitment to international\r\ncooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear technologies,\r\nthe European Union actively participated in the\r\norganization of a seminar on Nuclear Suppliers Group\r\ntransparency, to explain the Group’s policy, the aim of\r\nwhich is to encourage the development of nuclear\r\ntechnology for peaceful uses, in particular by promoting\r\ntransparency in nuclear export controls.\r\nThe responsibility for safe management of military\r\nfissile material lies in the first place with States\r\npossessing nuclear arms. Other States and international\r\norganizations, however, may give their support as and\r\nwhen required. The European Union takes note with\r\ninterest of the announcement made by the Russian\r\nFederation and the United States of America at the\r\nopening of the forty-first session of the General\r\nConference of the IAEA, with regard to fissile material\r\nresulting from the dismantling of nuclear arms and\r\nidentified as no longer being necessary for defence\r\npurposes. The European Union welcomes the efforts made\r\nto ensure the safe and protected storage of these materials\r\nin accordance with the relevant “voluntary offer”\r\nagreements on guarantees with the IAEA.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nLast year the IAEA, the European Commission and\r\nthe World Health Organization jointly sponsored an\r\ninternational conference to review the various technical and\r\nscientific assessments made to date, which will serve as the\r\nfactual basis for all decisions on future work and\r\ncooperation. The European Union reiterates its pledge to\r\nprovide financial assistance to the Ukrainian authorities so\r\nas to assist them in improving nuclear safety and security.\r\nWe would recall here Ukraine’s commitment to close down\r\nthe Chernobyl nuclear installations by the year 2000.\r\nThe European Union is determined to continue to play\r\na leading role in the strengthening of regulatory systems,\r\nthrough the establishment of, inter alia, the Nuclear Safety\r\nAccount administered by the European Bank for\r\nReconstruction and Development; the G-24 coordinating\r\nmechanism; the European Union’s PHARE and TACIS\r\nprogrammes; the EURATOM loan facility; coordinated\r\nsupport from financial institutions of the energy sector; and\r\nbilateral cooperation projects.\r\nThe European Union encourages States in their efforts\r\nto be made at the forthcoming International Pledging\r\nConference on the Chernobyl Sarcophagus, to be held in\r\nNew York, and notes with interest the forthcoming Special\r\nInternational Meeting on Chernobyl, also to be held in New\r\nYork.\r\nFor a number of years the Agency’s member States\r\nhave been discussing whether to revise article VI of its\r\nstatute. In this regard, the European Union would like to\r\nrecall that resolution GC(40)/RES/20, adopted last year by\r\nthe IAEA’s General Conference, called for the submission\r\nof a finalized formula to the forty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Conference in September 1997, in accordance with\r\narticle XVIII of the IAEA’s Statute. It notes with regret that\r\nthe formula was not submitted in time to be considered. It\r\nalso notes with interest the relevant provisions of resolution\r\nGC(41)/RES/20, adopted on 3 October 1997, which\r\ninstructs the Board of Governors to set a timetable for\r\nsubmission of a finalized formula to the forty-second\r\nGeneral Conference next year.\r\nThe European Union supports a balanced and lasting\r\nsolution, with a certain increase in the number of Board\r\nmembers, while taking into account the need to preserve the\r\nBoard’s efficiency and effectiveness and redefining the\r\ncriteria for appointing members, by giving each State the\r\npossibility of belonging to a regional group corresponding\r\nto its geographical region. A basic principle of justice\r\ndictates that no country can be automatically excluded from\r\nthe possibility of sitting on the Board and that every\r\ncountry must have the possibility of being elected by a\r\nregional group.\r\nThis means that the European Union could have\r\nagreed to the proposal of the Chairman of the Board of\r\nGovernors had it been adopted at the forty-first session of\r\nthe Agency’s General Conference. In our view, that\r\nproposal represents a compromise that would resolve the\r\ndifferent issues relating to article VI of the Statute. It will\r\ncontinue to have our support until the issue has been\r\nfinally settled.\r\nWhile we welcome the extra-budgetary contributions\r\nfrom a number of Governments, the European Union\r\nwould again urge all member States of the Agency to pay\r\ntheir assessed contributions promptly and in full to the\r\nregular budget, so that the Agency can fulfil all its tasks\r\npromptly and efficiently, according to a timetable that it\r\nhas been able to establish in advance on a sound financial\r\nbasis. It applauds the efforts of the Director General and\r\nhis staff, who have again shown their professionalism and\r\ncommitment to the aims of the Agency by concentrating\r\non its priority activities and applying rigorous standards\r\nthroughout the organization.\r\nThe European Union will vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/52/L.13, which has\r\njust been introduced by the representative of Japan, and\r\nit hopes that the General Assembly will be able to adopt\r\nit without a vote.\r\nThe President: I should like to propose that the list\r\nof speakers for the debate on this item be closed this\r\nmorning at 11.45.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I therefore request those\r\nrepresentatives wishing to participate in the debate on this\r\nitem to inscribe their names on the list as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nMr. Crighton (Australia): First of all, I wish, on\r\nbehalf of the Australian Government to thank the Director\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on the work of the\r\nAgency, and, further, for his long, dedicated and effective\r\nleadership. We warmly congratulate his confirmed\r\nsuccessor, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, and promise\r\nAustralia’s full support, as the Agency, following its\r\nfortieth anniversary, enters a new phase in its tasks of\r\nfacilitating and verifying the use of nuclear energy for\r\npeaceful purposes.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nMore than two years have passed since the historic\r\ndecision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The\r\nprinciples and objectives adopted at the 1995 Review and\r\nExtension Conference set out a programme of action\r\ncontaining elements both to reinforce nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and to take forward the commitment by all\r\nStates to general and complete disarmament under strict and\r\neffective international control. With 186 parties, there are\r\nnow more parties to the Treaty than Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations. Australia continues to urge those few States\r\nthat remain outside the Treaty to accede to it. In the\r\nmeantime, States parties have made a constructive start to\r\npreparations for the Sixth Review Conference in the year\r\n2000. In the course of their preparations, they will study the\r\nextent of implementation of the 1995 commitments.\r\nThe safeguards system is an integral element of the\r\nnon-proliferation regime, and the strengthened safeguards\r\nregime is central to achieving the objectives of the 1995\r\nNPT Review and Extension Conference. A highly\r\ndeveloped Agency capacity to detect undeclared nuclear\r\nactivity not only underpins much of nuclear usage today but\r\nwill be the key to the eventual attainment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world. Our goal should be the application of\r\nstrengthened safeguards in all States.\r\nIn May, the IAEA Board of Governors approved a\r\nnew Protocol for strengthening safeguards. The Protocol\r\nwill enhance the IAEA’s ability to detect undeclared\r\nnuclear activities. Thus, it supplements and extends the\r\nIAEA’s existing safeguards agreements to increase\r\nassurances that States subject to comprehensive safeguards\r\nhave declared all safeguardable nuclear activities. At the\r\nsame time, it contains measures which enhance the IAEA’s\r\nability to detect undeclared nuclear activities, principally\r\nthrough new technical methods, such as environmental\r\nsampling techniques, extended access at nuclear sites, new\r\naccess rights to nuclear-related sites and improved\r\navailability and analysis of nuclear-related information.\r\nConsistent with Australia’s traditional strong support\r\nfor effective safeguards, Australia was an active participant\r\nin the negotiation of the Model Protocol. Indeed, Australia\r\nwas pleased to be the very first member State to conclude\r\nand sign a bilateral Protocol with the Agency, incorporating\r\nthe measures in the Protocol into our safeguards\r\nobligations. We welcome the subsequent signatures of the\r\nProtocol by a number of States.\r\nHowever, to make the Protocol an operational reality,\r\na priority for the new Director General and his staff must\r\nbe to encourage States to adopt the Protocol. The Protocol\r\nrepresents the new standard for bilateral safeguards\r\nagreements with the IAEA. Accordingly, States should\r\nconclude their individual protocols with the IAEA as\r\nquickly as possible.\r\nAustralia sees the Agency’s twin roles in technical\r\ncooperation and safeguards as part of the political\r\ncompact between States which underpins the international\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. Australia will maintain\r\nits support for the Technical Cooperation Fund next year\r\nto the amount of 1,289,000 Australian dollars and will\r\ncontinue to participate in the Standing Advisory Group on\r\nTechnical Assistance and Cooperation.\r\nWe welcome the prominence of the Agency’s\r\nRegional Cooperation Agreement for Asia and the Pacific\r\n(RCA) as a tool for promoting regional cooperation in the\r\nnuclear field. We are considering providing 1.5 million\r\nAustralian dollars in extrabudgetary assistance for an\r\nRCA/IAEA project on the application of radio isotope\r\ntechnology to sustainable infrastructure development in\r\nAsia and the Pacific. That will cover public sector\r\nengineering, strengthened radiation protection and regional\r\neducation in nuclear medicine.\r\nThe planned state-of-the-art replacement for\r\nAustralia’s own research reactor will allow us to continue\r\ncontributing to regional technology by providing access to\r\na modern neutron source for researchers and students, not\r\nonly in Australia but from the wider Asian region as well.\r\nSafety is an essential consideration in the use of\r\nnuclear technology. Here, the Agency has also made new\r\nadvances. Australia was an early signatory to the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety and has since proceeded to\r\nratification. We hope to sign the new Joint Convention on\r\nthe Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety\r\nof Radioactive Waste Management following the\r\ncompletion of consultations within our own federal\r\nsystem. On 1 October, we signed the new Convention on\r\nSupplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, which\r\nprotects States which do not have nuclear power facilities\r\nbut could be subjected to risk from the transboundary\r\neffects of a nuclear accident. Wide adherence to this\r\nConvention, together with transparency about\r\ntransboundary shipments of radioactive materials, would\r\ndo much, I think, to allay the well-known concern of the\r\ncountries of the South Pacific about such shipments.\r\nNuclear power generation has expanded significantly\r\nin the East Asia region because it offers a source of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nenergy to meet the rapidly increasing energy demands of\r\nthe growing economies of the region. However, due\r\nattention to the highest standards of nuclear safety and\r\ntransparency in the application of these standards is\r\nessential if nuclear power is to fulfil its potential to be a\r\nsignificant component of the energy mix in the Asian\r\nregion.\r\nThe Asia-Pacific region is making nuclear safety a\r\nhigh priority. Japan hosted a conference on nuclear safety\r\nlast year and the Republic of Korea hosted a very\r\nsuccessful follow-up conference just last month. We would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to\r\nthe Governments of these two countries for this very\r\nimportant initiative. Australia hosted a regional workshop\r\non nuclear safety culture this year and we are planning to\r\nfollow up that workshop next year.\r\nAustralia has also taken the decision to restructure its\r\nradiation protection and nuclear safety agencies into an\r\nintegrated body, a national radiation protection and nuclear\r\nsafety agency, to regulate for best safety practice in\r\nAustralia.\r\nAnother essential component of the non-proliferation\r\nregime is the system of nuclear export controls, such as\r\nthose applied by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These\r\ncontrols facilitate transfers consistent with peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy. They do not have a hidden agenda. Indeed,\r\nin the interests of transparency, all States were invited to a\r\nseminar on the role of export controls in nuclear non-\r\nproliferation following the recent IAEA General\r\nConference. The seminar was well attended and offered\r\nample opportunity for a full and frank exchange of views\r\non the subject of export controls. Australia was pleased to\r\nhave a prominent role in the organization of this seminar,\r\nwhich partially fulfilled the expectation at the NPT Review\r\nand Extension Conference that efforts would be made to\r\nexplain better the operation of nuclear export controls and\r\ntheir contribution to nuclear non-proliferation to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn conclusion, the Agency has and will continue to\r\nhave a heavy responsibility. In that context, while we\r\nwelcome the functioning of the Agreed Framework between\r\nthe United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, we should all be concerned that little or no progress\r\nhas been achieved on preserving information relevant to the\r\nhistory of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s\r\nnuclear programme, prospectively undermining the\r\nAgency’s capacity to fulfil its safeguards function in the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nIt is also imperative to ensure that the past nuclear\r\nweapons programme of Iraq not be revived. We therefore\r\nplace considerable significance on the Agency’s\r\nmonitoring of present activities in Iraq. In this context, we\r\ndeplore Iraq’s decision of 29 October 1997 not to\r\ncooperate with the United Nations Special Commission,\r\nthe body in conjunction with which the IAEA must carry\r\nout its tasks in that country.\r\nWith these and other challenges, we urge the\r\ninternational community to pledge its support for the\r\nAgency by adhering to the legal instruments and\r\ncontinuing to provide the necessary human and financial\r\nresources to allow the Agency to carry out its mandated\r\ntasks.\r\nMrs. Sinha (India): The Indian delegation has taken\r\nnote of the contents of the report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented by Director\r\nGeneral Mr. Hans Blix.\r\nThe fortieth anniversary of the IAEA should be an\r\noccasion for introspection and charting future directions.\r\nWe need to ensure that the original goals of the “Atoms\r\nfor Peace” programme — the genesis of the IAEA — are\r\nmaintained and promoted. The IAEA must promote the\r\ndevelopment of nuclear power in developing countries,\r\nwhere it would generally be the inevitable option\r\nexercised to satisfy future energy needs. In its fortieth\r\nyear, the IAEA must ponder whether it has faltered in this\r\ntask and in the process not retained the pioneering,\r\nscientific and technological position it once occupied.\r\nInsufficient proactive promotion by the IAEA of nuclear\r\npower as an important energy option to eliminate global\r\npoverty and to protect the global environment has led to\r\nthe predictable consequence of nuclear energy being\r\nreferred to in a recent United Nations document only in\r\nthe context of safety and non-proliferation.\r\nThe perception that nuclear power is on the\r\ndownward slope is limited to the developed countries,\r\nwhere consumption patterns are already at extravagant\r\nlevels and where the association in the minds of the\r\npublic of nuclear power with nuclear weapons clouds\r\ntheir perception of the world’s need for nuclear power\r\ngeneration. The real demand for nuclear power is in the\r\ndeveloping countries, not only as an important energy\r\noption, but also as a catalyst for developing other high\r\ntechnologies. The problems of dwindling fossil reserves,\r\nas well as global warming, are too well known to bear\r\nrepetition here. According to one study, if we are to retain\r\ncarbon dioxide emissions at 1995 levels, then by the year\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\n2050 nuclear power is likely to see a near fivefold increase\r\nglobally. Indeed, it would be true to say that hampering\r\ngrowth in nuclear power is therefore equivalent to damage\r\nto the environment in the long run. The growth of nuclear\r\nenergy in the foreseeable future will be in Asia: in the\r\nRepublic of Korea and Japan now, and in India and China.\r\nThe doubt in some quarters about the need for nuclear\r\nexpansion today comes from the surfeit of energy in\r\ndeveloped countries, and the unfamiliarity with nuclear\r\ntechnology in most developing countries. The paramount\r\nrequirement is that of making safety a part of the culture of\r\nnuclear technology and instilling it in every facet from\r\ndesign and development to the siting, construction and\r\noperation of facilities. It is here that the IAEA holds the\r\ngreatest promise for rendering assistance to developing\r\nworld member States, which constitute the majority of its\r\nmembers. The Agency must be a prime mover in ensuring\r\nthat safety-related equipment and the free flow of\r\ninformation on research and development in safety-related\r\nissues is readily disseminated without being hindered by\r\narbitrary export control regimes.\r\nIt is important to note that the global community needs\r\nto reckon with a given country’s track record and potential\r\nfor peaceful development of nuclear energy when assessing\r\nthe nature of the technology and equipment flow to that\r\ncountry. Likewise, the Agency’s safeguards are important\r\nand must be implemented by the Agency in accordance\r\nwith Member States’ agreements with it. The Agency\r\nshould not become the spokesman for or take a role up-\r\nfront in the propagation of political restraints which form\r\nthe basis of safeguards. The hesitation stemming from\r\nunfamiliarity on the part of a developing country to initiate\r\na nuclear power programme should not be compounded by\r\nfears about safety and by uneasiness about commitments\r\nunder comprehensive safeguards agreements, as reinforced\r\nby programme “93+2”.\r\nThe Agency must play a key role in removing such\r\ninhibitions of newcomers to the field of nuclear power. In\r\nthe context of safeguards, we would like to refer to the\r\nadoption by a special meeting of the Board of Governors in\r\nMay this year of a Model Additional Protocol, to be\r\nconcluded between the Agency and member States which\r\nhave comprehensive safeguards arrangements. This Protocol\r\nis intended to detect undeclared nuclear facilities in\r\ncountries with comprehensive safeguards agreements, and\r\nobviously has no legal basis in countries which are not\r\nparty to such agreements.\r\nIndia has all along been keen to develop a\r\nconvention on the safety of radioactive waste management\r\nand has associated itself with the Expert Group meetings\r\nand the recent diplomatic conference. While the original\r\nmandate given by the General Conference in 1994 was\r\nfor developing a convention on the safety of radioactive\r\nwaste management, spent fuel management has also been\r\ntaken on board in this convention. We, who have a closed\r\nfuel cycle nuclear power programme, have consistently\r\nopposed the inclusion of spent fuel, which is a valuable\r\nresource material, along with radioactive waste in this\r\nconvention. Any nation which is party to this convention\r\nbut which regards spent fuel as a resource cannot be\r\nexpected to have any obligation to report such resource\r\nmaterial under the convention.\r\nIndia has paid considerable attention to non-power\r\napplications, including those in nuclear medicine,\r\nagriculture and industry, as well as in isotope hydrology,\r\npest control and potable water through desalination. We\r\nproduce over 100 varieties of radioisotopes. We are very\r\nglad that the IAEA is also helping in the introduction of\r\nthese applications in less developed countries. They are\r\nimportant, but should not overshadow the importance of\r\nnuclear power.\r\nWe are very happy to commemorate 25 years of the\r\nRegional Co-operative Agreement for Research,\r\nDevelopment and Training Related to Nuclear Science\r\nand Technology in Asia (RCA). The fledgling movement,\r\nwhich began as the India-Philippines Agency Project, and\r\nwhich has subsequently been nurtured into an agreement\r\ncovering 17 countries, has served as a model for similar\r\nregional groupings in Africa and Latin America. It also\r\nprovides a focus for technical cooperation between\r\ndeveloping countries. We seek to make independent\r\nprogrammes by supplementing and complementing the\r\nefforts of other agencies, like the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), and hope that the\r\nIAEA will be a benevolent catalyst in promoting the\r\nactivities of the RCA. India has made substantial in-kind\r\ncontributions of materials and manpower to this\r\nprogramme and will continue to do so in the future.\r\nTechnical cooperation should be an opportunity for\r\ngerminating projects arising out of interaction between\r\nscientists of different nations. The IAEA used to be such\r\na forum. A proper balance must be maintained between\r\nthe promotional and regulatory activities. Technical\r\ncooperation funding must also be sufficient, assured and\r\npredictable. Human resource development is an important\r\ncomponent of the technical cooperation activities, and the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nAgency should identify centres of excellence in the\r\ndeveloping countries as part of technical cooperation\r\nbetween developing countries.\r\nIndia is a donor country in technical cooperation. It\r\nhas been our experience that in high technology areas\r\ndeveloping countries find it easier to learn from one another\r\nthan from developed countries, because of cultural and\r\nsocial similarities between them.\r\nThe rosy vision painted in the late 1950s of nuclear\r\nenergy as a panacea for development and for power\r\ngeneration by 2000 has been realized only in part in the\r\nfirst four decades, and that too mostly in the developed\r\ncountries. It must be recognized that the developing world\r\ncannot be denied the right to strive for a reasonable quality\r\nof life, which can be ensured in the future only through\r\nnuclear power. There is much that the IAEA can do to\r\ndrive out pessimism, to encourage the growth of the\r\nnuclear-safety culture and to ensure that safeguards\r\nimplementation does not inhibit technology development in\r\nthe area of nuclear power. If these factors are given due\r\nattention, the IAEA will not only survive through the\r\ntwenty-first century but will also become a major player in\r\nushering in a new and great age for all humanity.\r\nMr. Albin (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe completion of Mr. Hans Blix’s term of office at the\r\nhead of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\nafter 16 years of fruitful work is an opportunity for the\r\nGovernment of Mexico to express its appreciation for such\r\nan outstanding record, and it is also a fitting time to take\r\nstock of the work of the Agency.\r\nThe international conditions that prevailed when\r\nMr. Hans Blix for the first time assumed the leadership of\r\nthe IAEA have changed radically. With farsightedness and\r\nskill, Mr. Blix was able to convert the difficulties inherent\r\nin a constantly changing international context into\r\nopportunities to strengthen the Agency in its various areas\r\nof competence. Indeed, the Agency has had to resolve\r\nmany difficulties in recent years in order to be in a position\r\nto respond to the expectations of its member States.\r\nUnder Mr. Blix’s leadership, it was possible to\r\nestablish a system of genuine international cooperation for\r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy as a counterpart to the\r\ncommitment by the parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) not to acquire or\r\nin any way develop nuclear weapons. The report that we\r\nare considering today describes the application of nuclear\r\nenergy to a broad range of peaceful activities for the benefit\r\nof agriculture and food, health, geology, physics,\r\nchemistry and the protection of the environment.\r\nMexico is pleased at the decision to confer upon\r\nMr. Hans Blix the title of Director General Emeritus of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. In paying tribute\r\nto this great friend of Mexico, I wish to welcome the new\r\nDirector General of the IAEA, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei,\r\nto whom we express our support and our confidence.\r\nMexico has always wanted the IAEA, in the\r\nfulfilment of its mandate, to maintain a vital balance\r\nbetween its security activities and those of cooperation\r\nand technical assistance for development. The IAEA has\r\ngiven us its cooperation. Among the most recent\r\nprogrammes that it has developed, I should like to\r\nemphasize the one on nuclear medicine, which will have\r\na significant social and economic impact for the benefit\r\nof the country’s scientific community and end users. The\r\nIAEA’s training of Mexican scientists has made it\r\npossible for my country to cooperate in programmes to\r\ntrain foreign experts.\r\nThese are just a few examples of the association for\r\ndevelopment between the Agency and its member States\r\nthat we have always advocated. The Regional Cooperative\r\nArrangements for the Promotion of Nuclear Science and\r\nTechnology in Latin America (ARCAL) have led to 12\r\nprojects that are now being implemented. But until we\r\nresolve the problem of financing activities in this field,\r\nthese programmes will be at risk.\r\nRespect for the balance to which I have referred is\r\nessential for a better implementation of the commitments\r\nthat we have undertaken through the Treaty of Tlatelolco\r\nand the NPT and in general for confidence-building\r\namong Member States. Member States are establishing\r\nmechanisms to fulfil obligations derived from other\r\ntreaties that prohibit weapons of mass destruction, such as\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and the strengthening\r\nof the regime established by the Convention on Biological\r\nWeapons. At the present time, the IAEA’s experience\r\ncould be a source of guidance to ensure the non-\r\ndiscriminatory application of all of the obligations\r\nassumed under these two instruments.\r\nThe year that is drawing to a close has seen\r\nimportant advances in the development of norms\r\nregarding a number of aspects of nuclear safety. Last\r\nSeptember, we adopted the Joint Convention on the\r\nSafety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of\r\nRadioactive Waste Management. The competent\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nauthorities of the Mexican Government have already begun\r\nstudies with a view to developing the secondary legislation\r\nthat is required by this instrument in order to be able to\r\nsign it. The regime established by the Vienna Convention\r\non Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention\r\non Supplementary Compensation was strengthened by the\r\nadoption of the Protocol to amend the Vienna Convention.\r\nMy Government intends to sign this Protocol once certain\r\ninternal legislative adjustments have been made.\r\nMexico, as a promoter of the first nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone and in its capacity as depositary of the Treaty of\r\nTlatelolco, has followed with special interest the process\r\nreferred to as “93+2”. For this reason, we welcome the\r\nconclusion of the Model Additional Protocol to the\r\nsafeguards agreements. The granting of broader authority to\r\nthe IAEA must serve to buttress the existing non-\r\nproliferation regime. In this respect, it is of particular\r\nimportance that the Model Additional Protocol is addressed\r\nto all Member States, regardless of the type of safeguards\r\nthat they have with the IAEA. Mexico, of course, intends\r\nto sign a protocol on this issue with the Agency.\r\nThe IAEA is beginning a new stage in the\r\nstrengthening of its activities. Requirements are emerging\r\nthat stem from ever more varied applications of atomic\r\nenergy, and more nuclear-weapon-free zones have been\r\ncreated. The Agency is also called upon to offer its know-\r\nhow and experience to the future Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty Organization.\r\nThe positive results of the IAEA’s activities are\r\nreflected in the constant increase in the number of its\r\nmembers, as can be seen from the requests for admission\r\nfrom Malta and Burkina Faso. But representativity must\r\nalso be reflected in the composition of the Board of\r\nGovernors. Mexico supports the consultations that are under\r\nway to establish a mechanism that will allow the expansion,\r\nin a transparent manner, of the composition of the Board of\r\nGovernors.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. Park (Republic of Korea): My delegation thanks\r\nMr. Hans Blix, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his comprehensive\r\nreport on the activities of the Agency over the past year.\r\nWe also pay tribute to him for his 16 years of dedicated\r\nservice as Director General of the Agency. During his long\r\nstewardship he set an example of how effectively and\r\nefficiently an international organization can be run. We\r\nhope that the international community can continue to\r\ndraw on his experience and wisdom even after his\r\nretirement at the end of this month. We also congratulate\r\nDr. Mohamed ElBaradei on his appointment as the next\r\nDirector General, and pledge the full support and\r\ncooperation of my Government as he steers the Agency\r\ninto the next millennium.\r\nThe IAEA celebrated its fortieth anniversary this\r\nyear. Over the past four decades the Agency has made a\r\nunique contribution to peace and to the well-being of\r\nhumanity. The Agency’s activities in setting international\r\nstandards for nuclear safety and radioactive-waste\r\nmanagement have been crucial in strengthening public\r\nconfidence in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. At a\r\ntime when the international community is struggling to\r\ndeal with the problems of environmental degradation\r\nresulting from the excessive use of fossil fuel, the\r\nAgency’s achievements in the area of nuclear safety\r\nunderline the merits of nuclear energy as the most\r\nfeasible and attractive alternative to fossil fuel. Thanks to\r\nits technical cooperation programmes, know-how relating\r\nto nuclear applications in such diverse areas as\r\nagriculture, health, industry and water-resources\r\nmanagement is now available to a growing number of\r\ndeveloping countries. The Agency is also playing an\r\nindispensable role in building a safer world free from the\r\nthreat of nuclear proliferation, through its safeguards\r\nactivities under the mandate of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and under\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nLet me now touch on some of the Agency’s\r\nactivities to which my Government attaches particular\r\nimportance. The Republic of Korea welcomes the\r\nadoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent\r\nFuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste\r\nManagement at the diplomatic conference held last\r\nSeptember in Vienna under the auspices of the IAEA.\r\nThe adoption of this long-awaited Convention will greatly\r\ncontribute to the protection of people and the environment\r\nfrom the potential hazards of spent fuel and radioactive\r\nwaste. Being one of the first countries to sign the Joint\r\nConvention, we urge those countries which have not yet\r\ndone so to sign it without delay, and we look forward to\r\nits early entry into force.\r\nThe recent adoption of the Protocol to amend the\r\n1963 Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear\r\nDamage and the Convention on Supplementary\r\nCompensation for Nuclear Damage should also be\r\nwelcomed as another important insurance policy for\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nnuclear safety. Together with the entry into force of the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety in October 1996 and the\r\nadoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent\r\nFuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste\r\nManagement, these two new instruments in the field of\r\nnuclear liability will further facilitate the expansion of the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy by enhancing an\r\ninternational safety culture and helping to dispel any\r\nlingering public misgivings about nuclear safety.\r\nMy Government has consistently supported the\r\nAgency’s efforts since 1992 to strengthen the effectiveness\r\nand efficiency of its safeguards system within the context\r\nof programme “93+2”. We are pleased to note that these\r\nefforts led finally to the adoption last May at a special\r\nmeeting of the IAEA Board of Governors of a model\r\nprotocol additional to safeguards agreements. We welcome\r\nthis important achievement and will duly incorporate the\r\nprovisions of the model protocol into our national laws and\r\nregulations for prompt implementation. We believe that the\r\nstrengthening of the safeguards system will enhance the\r\nAgency’s capability not only to detect diversions of nuclear\r\nmaterial from declared facilities, but also to detect\r\nundeclared nuclear activities. As such, it will strengthen the\r\ncredibility of the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nAs a practical step to support and supplement the\r\nAgency’s own strengthened safeguards system at the\r\ndomestic level, the Republic of Korea enacted a national\r\ninspection system in August this year. We expect that this\r\nsystem will facilitate the Agency’s safeguards activities and\r\nthus further enhance the transparency of nuclear activities\r\nin my country.\r\nLet me now turn to the long-standing North Korean\r\nnuclear issue. Despite the enormous time and effort devoted\r\nby the Agency over the past several years to ensure North\r\nKorea’s compliance with its safeguards obligations, North\r\nKorea’s refusal to come into full compliance with its\r\nsafeguards agreement with the IAEA continues unabated.\r\nThe light-water reactor project undertaken under the\r\nauspices of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development\r\nOrganization is proceeding smoothly, but no progress has\r\nyet been forthcoming in the Agency’s three-year effort to\r\npreserve the information relevant to North Korea’s past\r\nnuclear activities pending its full compliance, as mandated\r\nby the Security Council in November 1994. We fully share\r\nthe serious concern already expressed in this regard by the\r\nrepresentative of Luxembourg on behalf of the European\r\nUnion and by the representative of Australia. This is indeed\r\na matter of serious concern not only to my Government but\r\nto the international community as a whole, as North\r\nKorea’s lack of cooperation with the Agency in\r\npreserving the relevant information could cause serious\r\ndifficulties for the light-water reactor project that is under\r\nway. Under the terms of the Agreed Framework between\r\nthe United States and North Korea, the light-water reactor\r\nproject’s completion is predicated on the Agency’s\r\nverification of the correctness and completeness of\r\nPyongyang’s initial report, which will be impossible\r\nwithout the preservation of the information required by\r\nthe Agency. We hope that the DPRK will fully realize the\r\nconsequences of its continuing non-cooperation with the\r\nAgency and will act accordingly without further delay.\r\nIt must be emphasized again that the ultimate\r\nresolution of the North Korean nuclear issue will be\r\npossible only when Pyongyang faithfully abides by both\r\nits multilateral and its bilateral non-proliferation\r\ncommitments under the NPT, the Agreed Framework and\r\nthe Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the\r\nKorean Peninsula signed by South and North Korea in\r\n1991.\r\nThe Republic of Korea attaches great importance to\r\nthe work of the IAEA. In his statement this morning,\r\nMr. Hans Blix of the IAEA spoke at length about the\r\nmerits of nuclear energy. In my country, there are\r\ncurrently 12 power stations in operation with a combined\r\ncapacity of more than 10,000 megawatts. If the amount of\r\nenergy currently supplied by those power reactors were to\r\nbe met by oil-fuelled power plants, it would each year\r\nadd nearly 45 million tons of carbon dioxide to our\r\nalready polluted air and $2 billion to our existing trade\r\ndeficit as a result of the 14 million tons of additional\r\npetroleum imports which would be required.\r\nUnder a long-term nuclear development plan\r\nfinalized last July, my Government plans to build 15\r\nmore power reactors by the year 2010. We plan to invest\r\n$7 billion over the next 13 years in nuclear research and\r\ndevelopment programmes. These programmes include,\r\namong other things, the development of small-and\r\nmedium-capacity multi-purpose power reactors which can\r\nalso be used for seawater desalination and heating, as\r\nwell as the development of advanced next-generation\r\nreactor and fusion technology. Korea also assigns a high\r\npriority to expanding applications of nuclear energy in the\r\nindustrial, medical and agricultural fields.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, the Asia-Pacific region is\r\nexpected to become the most active in the world in the\r\nuse and development of nuclear energy. We therefore\r\nattach particular importance to nuclear cooperation among\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nthe Asia-Pacific countries, particularly in the field of\r\nnuclear safety.\r\nThe Seoul Conference on Nuclear Safety in Asia,\r\nwhich we hosted on 30 October 1997, is a concrete\r\nmanifestation of our interest in playing a meaningful role in\r\nthis regard. We will soon open an international nuclear\r\ntraining centre in Korea, with a view to sharing know-how\r\nin the peaceful applications of nuclear energy with other\r\ninterested countries.\r\nFinally, I reiterate my Government’s firm commitment\r\nto the goals of the IAEA and pledge our full support to the\r\nAgency’s efforts to build a more prosperous and peaceful\r\nworld. It is our sincere wish that the draft resolution before\r\nthe General Assembly will enjoy the unanimous support of\r\nMember States.\r\nMr. Berdennikov (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): Our delegation is grateful to the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency,\r\nMr. Hans Blix, for his introduction of the Agency’s annual\r\nreport, which provides a very detailed description of IAEA\r\nactivities.\r\nThe Russian Federation has consistently supported the\r\nactivities of the IAEA. The Agency justifiably has a strong\r\nreputation for generating ideas and initiating practical\r\nactions aimed at enhancing nuclear safety and security by\r\nundertaking the dual functions of strengthening the\r\ninternational non-proliferation regime and developing\r\npeaceful cooperation in the use of atomic energy.\r\nThe international community has recently made\r\nsubstantial progress in ensuring global and regional\r\nsecurity. An indefinite and unconditional extension of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\r\nin 1995 was a most important positive development in this\r\nregard. Under these circumstances, the comprehensive\r\nstrengthening of the non-proliferation regime becomes all\r\nthe more relevant.\r\nRussia, as one of the NPT depositary States,\r\nunequivocally confirms the steadfastness of its position in\r\nrespect of the principles contained in the Treaty. We oppose\r\nattempts to revise the Treaty, which has effectively\r\nprevented the dissemination of nuclear weapons throughout\r\nour planet for more than a quarter of a century.\r\nWe consider it to be of great importance in this\r\ncontext to start negotiations, within the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, on a non-discriminatory and universal\r\nmultilateral agreement on the prohibition of the\r\nproduction of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or\r\nother nuclear explosive devices. It is well known that\r\nRussia has already halted the production of weapon-grade\r\nuranium. A national programme to stop the production of\r\nweapon-grade plutonium will be implemented in 1998.\r\nA new initiative put forward by Russia’s President\r\nBoris Nikolayevich Yeltsin in his address to the fortieth\r\nanniversary session of the IAEA General Conference\r\nprovided further evidence that our words and our deeds\r\nare consistent. The decision gradually to remove up to\r\n500 tons of highly enriched uranium and up to 50 tons of\r\nweapon-grade plutonium from nuclear military\r\nprogrammes was an effective practical contribution by\r\nRussia to making nuclear disarmament irreversible.\r\nThe trilateral initiative put forward by the Minister\r\nfor Atomic Energy of Russia, the Secretary of Energy of\r\nthe United States and the Director General of IAEA\r\nconcerning the application of the Agency’s verification\r\nprocedures to weapon-grade fissile material had an\r\nimportant part in the efforts made in this area. The\r\nobjective of this initiative was to fulfil the obligations\r\nassumed by the Presidents of the two countries with\r\nregard to applying IAEA verification procedures and to\r\nmaking the reductions in nuclear weapons transparent and\r\nirreversible. In 1996, the parties established a joint group\r\nto consider technological, legal and financial aspects of\r\nthe application of IAEA verification procedures to such\r\nfissile material.\r\nRussia consistently supports IAEA activities aimed\r\nat improving the system of safeguards. Verification\r\nactivities of the Agency should continue to be a priority,\r\nmaking it possible to conduct a technically precise,\r\npolitically impartial and legally indisputable analysis of\r\nthe nature of nuclear activities carried out by non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States parties to the NPT.\r\nStrengthening the non-proliferation regime and\r\nassuring nuclear safety and security also presuppose the\r\neffective elimination of illegal trafficking in nuclear\r\nmaterial.\r\nWe are convinced that one of the Agency’s primary\r\npurposes should be to ensure the viability of nuclear\r\npower as one of the basic conditions for meeting the\r\nworld community’s demand for energy.\r\nIn our view, on the eve of the twenty-first century,\r\nthe Agency could begin to elaborate a comprehensive\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nstrategy on the development of nuclear power. First, it\r\nwould be based on meeting safely the growing requirements\r\nof an increasingly interdependent world for electric power\r\nin the short term. Secondly, it would seek to ensure the\r\nstrategic security and reliability of electric power generation\r\nin a longer-term perspective. And thirdly, it would\r\nundertake the task of reducing the threat of global climate\r\nchange on the planet, caused, inter alia, by the constantly\r\ngrowing electric power production at standard thermal\r\npower plants.\r\nRussia regards the exploitation of the enormous\r\nscientific and technical potential, formerly the exclusive\r\nprerogative of military programmes, as one of the areas for\r\nthe development of nuclear energy related to the reduction\r\nand utilization of nuclear weapons. We see the role of the\r\nAgency here as one of coordinating international\r\ncooperation with a view to choosing an economically sound\r\nand environmentally safe use of weapon-grade material in\r\na civilian nuclear fuel cycle.\r\nThe future of nuclear power is inseparably linked to\r\nthe need to meet ever growing safety requirements. The\r\nMoscow Summit on Nuclear Safety and Security made a\r\nmajor contribution to the solution of this entire range of\r\nproblems. We think it important to continue the positive\r\ninitiatives contained in the Moscow agreements. We are\r\nglad to note that the IAEA has begun to play a bigger role\r\nin ensuring nuclear safety and security.\r\nThe establishment of international legal mechanisms\r\nfor regulating nuclear activities has been continuing with\r\nthe Agency’s active involvement. One incontrovertible\r\nachievement in this field was the elaboration and adoption\r\nof the international Convention on Nuclear Safety. The\r\nJoint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management\r\nand on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management was\r\nalso developed under IAEA auspices. With the IAEA’s\r\nassistance, we should now consolidate an entirely new\r\ninternational trend — that of transforming the atom from a\r\nfactor of divisiveness, deterrence and confrontation into one\r\nof partnership, interaction and peace.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): Allow me to begin by\r\nexpressing the gratitude of the Government of the Republic\r\nof Armenia for the important work carried out by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) during 1996\r\nand the first part of 1997. We commend the Director\r\nGeneral, Mr. Hans Blix, and the secretariat and staff of the\r\nAgency for their commitment and professionalism in\r\ndelivering an expanded programme within resource\r\nconstraints.\r\nThe presentation by the IAEA of its annual report to\r\nthe General Assembly provides us with the valuable\r\nopportunity to review the work which the Agency has\r\ndone and to measure the impact of its activities in the\r\nvarious fields in which it operates in accordance with its\r\nstatutory functions.\r\nFor the past 40 years the international community\r\nhas relied on the IAEA as the key organization in\r\npreventing nuclear weapons proliferation and in\r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We have\r\nalso witnessed the IAEA’s unique role in establishing an\r\ninternational legal system, standards and norms to ensure\r\nthe safe use of nuclear energy. Armenia applauds the\r\nprogress achieved by the IAEA in preparing these legal\r\nbases in the form of the Convention on Nuclear Safety,\r\nthe Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel\r\nManagement and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste\r\nManagement and the Convention on Civil Liability for\r\nNuclear Damage.\r\nToday we would like to commend the Agency once\r\nagain for its invaluable help in the reactivation of one unit\r\nof the Armenian nuclear power plant at Medzamor, and\r\nfor providing ongoing support and technical assistance to\r\nensure its safe operation.\r\nAfter independence, the establishment of a viable\r\nnational energy system was among the most challenging\r\ntasks faced by the Armenian Government. Being\r\nabsolutely reliant on geographically remote suppliers of\r\nconventional energy, the country was subjected to a heavy\r\nenergy blockade by neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey\r\nand as a result found itself in a deep energy crisis, which\r\nforced it to operate the Medzamor nuclear power plant\r\nagain. This decision was made with full acknowledgment\r\nby the Government of its responsibility to guarantee the\r\nsafe operation of the plant.\r\nWe give absolute priority to the safety of our\r\npeaceful nuclear energy programme and seek to observe\r\nand implement the IAEA guidelines and policies, whether\r\nthey relate to the safe operation of our nuclear industry,\r\nor to the readiness to provide all required information and\r\naddress the concerns of neighbouring countries.\r\nAs a non-nuclear weapon State developing peaceful\r\nnuclear energy, Armenia attaches great importance to the\r\nissue of international compliance with nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament objectives and obligations.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to full implementation of\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\n(NPT) and firmly support the IAEA programme on\r\nstrengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency\r\nof the safeguards system. In this respect, I would also like\r\nto recall the fact that on 29 September 1997 Armenia\r\nsigned the additional protocol to its comprehensive\r\nsafeguards agreement with the IAEA.\r\nWe welcome the entry into force of the Convention on\r\nNuclear Safety and the adoption of the Joint Convention on\r\nthe Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of\r\nRadioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend the\r\nVienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage\r\nand the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for\r\nNuclear Damage. It is our strong conviction that these\r\nConventions will facilitate international safety cooperation\r\nand provide increased compensation for victims in the event\r\nof a nuclear accident.\r\nArmenia is making progress in other important\r\ndirections with regard to its peaceful nuclear energy\r\nprogramme. We are currently drafting the legal basis for the\r\nprogramme and developing inter-agency consensus to\r\nexpedite its processing by the legislative branch. In\r\nSeptember 1997 a draft law, entitled “On Nuclear Energy\r\nUtilization for Peaceful Purposes”, was submitted to the\r\nNational Assembly for approval. Armenia is willing to\r\ncontinue its cooperation with leading international\r\nconsultants in the field, such as the International Legal\r\nGroup, which functions under the auspices of the IAEA.\r\nWe also appreciate the assistance provided by Sweden in\r\nthe field of nuclear energy use.\r\nTo meet its international obligations and regulate the\r\nsphere of nuclear energy use, the Armenian Government\r\nhas established a National Nuclear Regulatory Authority,\r\nwhich has already been able to develop close relationships\r\nwith related international organizations and national\r\nregulatory bodies. As a national coordinator of technical\r\ncooperation programmes, the Authority steers the activity\r\nof Armenia’s agencies and centres participating in the eight\r\nnational and 17 regional programmes under the auspices of\r\nthe IAEA.\r\nCurrently Armenia and the IAEA are working on the\r\ndevelopment of programmes of technical cooperation for\r\nthe period between 1998 and 2000, and are involved in a\r\nsubstantive dialogue and consultation on efficient planning,\r\nimplementation and review of the cooperation projects. We\r\nwill soon submit to the Agency the new set of technical\r\ncooperation proposals for the next implementation period.\r\nUnder the aegis of the IAEA, the National Nuclear\r\nRegulatory Authority closely cooperates with its partner\r\nregulatory bodies of the Slovak Republic, the Czech\r\nRepublic, the United States, Russia, Argentina and others.\r\nThis cooperation includes joint projects on nuclear safety\r\nresearch and development, exchange of technical\r\ninformation relating to safety issues and the\r\nenvironmental impact of nuclear energy facilities,\r\nlicensing and regulation of reactor safety research and\r\noperating experience.\r\nWe fully associate ourselves with the views of the\r\nDirector General regarding the dramatic environmental\r\nand humanitarian consequences of the accelerated use of\r\nfossil fuel. Considering the increasing environmental cost\r\nto society of wastes from burnt fossil fuels and the risk of\r\nglobal warming, we believe in safe and peaceful nuclear\r\nenergy as a cost-effective and clean source of energy for\r\nthe future.\r\nCountries with limited mineral resources, like\r\nArmenia, will continue to view the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency as the central medium for the safeguarded\r\ntransfer of nuclear technology, operational expertise, and\r\ntechnical assistance to countries which explicitly adhere\r\nto international non-proliferation objectives and comply\r\nwith the existing regulations.\r\nThe fundamental changes in international security\r\nhave helped reduce the threat of global confrontation.\r\nHowever, the emerging environment has brought about\r\nnew security concerns and challenges that arise from\r\nregional competition, the threat of nuclear, bacteriological\r\nand chemical proliferation and organized and individual\r\nterrorism. At the global level, these challenges have\r\nbecome more asymmetrical, and therefore more difficult\r\nto cope with. The active engagement of all responsible\r\nmembers of the international community is vital to\r\naddress these challenges and to advance our common\r\nsafety, non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament\r\ngoals.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to once again pay tribute\r\nto Mr. Hans Blix for the dedication with which he has\r\nconducted the work of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency throughout his 16 years of distinguished service\r\nas its Director General. I also wish to take this\r\nopportunity to extend our best wishes for success to the\r\nincoming Director General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, and\r\nto assure him of our support and cooperation.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nMr. Marrero (United States of America): On behalf\r\nof the United States, I would like to commend the Director\r\nGeneral for his report and take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate him on 16 years of outstanding service at the\r\nhelm of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\r\nAs the President of the United States said in his message to\r\nthis year’s session of the General Conference,\r\n“in no small measure, the excellence, commitment and\r\ncreativity of the IAEA has been exemplified and\r\nfostered by outgoing Director General Hans Blix”.\r\nI also want to welcome Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei as the\r\nnew Director General, and pledge our support to him as we\r\nwork together in pursuit of the IAEA’s vital objectives.\r\nOver the years the IAEA has committed itself to a\r\ndiverse set of programmes that enhance the security, health,\r\nenvironment and safety of the international community. It\r\nhas done so with distinction. The IAEA achievements\r\nreflected in the Director General’s report demonstrate the\r\ncritical role of the Agency in encouraging cooperation in\r\nthe many important peaceful uses of nuclear material and\r\ntechnology under sound non-proliferation conditions. The\r\nAgency’s safeguards system performs the essential function\r\nof verifying compliance with the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and other non-\r\nproliferation treaties. The United States welcomes the\r\ninternational agreement of last May to strengthen the\r\nsafeguards system, and strongly supports continued efforts\r\nto bring the agreed new safeguards measures quickly into\r\neffect.\r\nIntegral to all of the Agency’s programmes is the\r\ncommitment to nuclear safety. Safety considerations are at\r\nthe heart of every IAEA technical cooperation project.\r\nTraining programmes emphasize safety. Operational safety\r\nreview teams promote safety in all aspects. The Convention\r\non Nuclear Safety embodies the commitment of its\r\nsignatories to safety. The United States welcomes the Joint\r\nConvention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and\r\non the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and the\r\nresolution on the Chernobyl sarcophagus adopted at this\r\nyear’s General Conference, as further commitment to\r\nnuclear safety. The United States reaffirms its commitment\r\nto the Agency’s work in nuclear safety and our\r\ncommitment to strengthening further this important\r\nendeavour.\r\nThe United States would also like to commend the\r\nAgency’s continued efforts to implement the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council resolutions with regard to Iraq. We believe\r\nthat Iraq is continuing to withhold information from the\r\nAgency. We understand the Agency’s desire to focus\r\nmore on building a long-term monitoring regime in Iraq.\r\nWe call on Iraq to provide a complete accounting of its\r\nnuclear weapons programme and respond to all IAEA\r\nrequests for information.\r\nThe United States also would like to thank the IAEA\r\nfor its devoted efforts to ensure the safeguarding of the\r\nworld’s nuclear material. The Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea’s lack of cooperation with the IAEA\r\nis of concern to the United States. We encourage the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to work with the\r\nAgency towards full compliance with its safeguards\r\nagreement and, in the interim, take all steps the IAEA\r\ndeems necessary to preserve all information relevant to\r\nverifying the accuracy and completeness of its initial\r\nreport of the inventory of nuclear material subject to the\r\nsafeguards.\r\nThe programme for combating illicit trafficking in\r\nnuclear material underscores the need for improved\r\ncooperative efforts in monitoring nuclear materials. Again,\r\nthe Agency has taken this opportunity to distinguish itself\r\nas a leader in this effort.\r\nThe United States wishes to reiterate its continued\r\nsupport for the technical cooperation programme. As the\r\nmajor contributor to this valuable programme we\r\nrecognize its importance for promoting the quality of\r\nhuman life in many countries. The diversity of the\r\nbenefits and projects undertaken in the technical\r\ncooperation programme provides the world with a better\r\nunderstanding of how nuclear materials can be used to\r\nsolve a variety of issues in medicine, health, agriculture\r\nand basic industry. Thus it continues to assist in shaping\r\nthe vision for the peaceful uses of nuclear material for the\r\nfuture.\r\nAgain, on behalf of the United States, I would like\r\nto thank Mr. Blix for his report and for his many years of\r\nmost distinguished service, and to wish him well in his\r\nfuture endeavours. The United States looks forward to\r\ncontinuing its cooperation with the Agency, recognizing\r\nthe importance of this valuable asset to the security of the\r\nworld and its people.\r\nMr. Benítez Sáenz (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The delegations of the Southern Cone Common\r\nMarket (MERCOSUR) countries — Argentina, Brazil,\r\nParaguay and Uruguay — and Bolivia and Chile, which\r\nare associated States, express their satisfaction at the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\ndetailed and well-balanced report presented by the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA), Mr. Hans Blix.\r\nThis year is the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of\r\nresolution 1145 (XII), which established the relationship\r\nbetween the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\nand this Organization. The commendable work of the IAEA\r\nin promoting the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy\r\ndeserves to be mentioned once again. The progress\r\nachieved in terms of both international cooperation and the\r\napplication of safeguards is extremely relevant to\r\nMERCOSUR countries. Furthermore, our countries are\r\ngratified that the General Conference of the Agency has\r\nconsidered the first acceptances by various States of the\r\nAdditional Protocol prepared in the framework of\r\nprogramme “93+2”, which supplements existing safeguards\r\nagreements.\r\nOne sphere of IAEA action that our countries are\r\nfollowing with great interest is that of the technical and\r\nscientific evaluations conducted in recent years. In this\r\nrespect, we welcome the holding of the International\r\nConference on the Consequences of the Chernobyl\r\nAccident, 10 years after the tragic event. Major conclusions\r\nwere drawn from the Conference in terms of the physical\r\nand psychological effects on the population and on\r\nenvironmental aspects.\r\nWe also would like to express our pleasure at the\r\nresults of two diplomatic conferences on the Joint\r\nConvention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and\r\non the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and the\r\nProtocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil\r\nLiability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on\r\nSupplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. These\r\ncontributions are a clear commitment on the part of the\r\ninternational community to updating and strengthening\r\ninternational standards that regulate the different aspects of\r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nThe commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the\r\nTreaty of Tlatelolco this year coincides with the celebration\r\nof the first five years of operation of the Brazilian-\r\nArgentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear\r\nMaterials (ABACC). This Agency has successfully fulfilled\r\nits commitment to establish a verification system in\r\naccordance with the quadripartite safeguards agreement\r\nwhich has led to fruitful interaction between the ABACC\r\nand the IAEA. Nevertheless, the ABACC intends to\r\ncontinue its efforts to improve this interaction. In this\r\nconnection, it recently concluded the negotiation of an\r\nagreement between the ABACC and the IAEA on\r\ncooperation between the two agencies. This agreement\r\nwill serve to recognize the increasing maturity of the\r\nABACC and contribute to the steadily growing\r\ncoordination of the work of the two agencies in order to\r\nmake the provisions of the quadripartite agreement more\r\neffective.\r\nAs regards technical cooperation in the peaceful uses\r\nof nuclear energy, we are involved in the process of\r\nupdating and modernizing what is known as the ARCAL\r\nprogramme, which provides a vehicle for cooperation in\r\nour region. Likewise, and in the framework of this\r\nprogramme, we are about to consider a draft\r\ngovernmental agreement which, if adopted, will serve as\r\na framework for cooperation in the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy in Latin America.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like, once again, to express\r\nour appreciation of the comprehensive report of the\r\nDirector General of the IAEA and we reaffirm the\r\ncommitment of our countries to the objectives of the\r\nAgency.\r\nMr. Rider (New Zealand): This has been a special\r\nyear for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\r\nAt the time of its fortieth anniversary we had the\r\nopportunity to look back on the Agency’s very\r\nconsiderable achievements since 1957 and look forward\r\nto the future. In New Zealand’s view, the IAEA has\r\nestablished itself over that period as a leading multilateral\r\ninstitution, and one which makes an extremely valuable\r\ncontribution to the international community.\r\nToday, though, we are only looking back over the\r\npast year. As always, it has been a busy one for the\r\nAgency, its staff and member States. It has also been the\r\nfirst year New Zealand has served as a member of the\r\nAgency’s Board of Governors, with the support of our\r\ncolleagues in the South-East Asia and Pacific regional\r\ngroup. We sought election to the Board in recognition of\r\nthe fact that the Agency’s non-proliferation and other\r\nactivities are of increasing relevance to all countries,\r\nincluding those like New Zealand, without major nuclear\r\nindustries. We are proud to have worked with the\r\nAgency, and we look forward to continuing a very\r\nproductive association.\r\nThe report in document A/52/285, introduced earlier\r\nthis morning by Mr. Blix, the Agency’s Director General,\r\nreflects fairly the wide range of issues that have been the\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nfocus of the Agency’s attention over the past year. I would\r\nlike to talk a little about these activities.\r\nOne aspect of the IAEA’s effort to which New\r\nZealand attaches special importance is its work in the\r\nimplementation of the safeguards provisions. These derive\r\nfrom several sources, most notably the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. But other international\r\ntreaties, conventions and agreements achieve similar\r\nobjectives. In our own part of the world the South Pacific\r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty provides for the\r\napplication of IAEA safeguards. Other nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone treaties do likewise.\r\nThe IAEA’s role in applying these safeguards is of\r\ncritical importance in maintaining the global nuclear non-\r\nproliferation architecture. The reassurance provided by the\r\nwork of the Agency in this regard also provides a\r\nfoundation for efforts for nuclear disarmament.\r\nNew Zealand therefore warmly welcomes the\r\ndevelopment of the Model Additional Protocol. We were\r\nactive in the negotiations on this instrument, and were very\r\npleased with the outcome. We are confident the Model\r\nAdditional Protocol will greatly enhance the Agency’s\r\nability to detect undeclared nuclear activities. Events in\r\nrecent years have shown that there will always be a need\r\nfor vigilance, and we are pleased that the Agency’s powers\r\nhave been extended in this way.\r\nNew Zealand is in the process of undertaking the\r\ndomestic consultation required for us to conclude the\r\nProtocol. We would urge all other countries to implement\r\nthe Protocol as soon as possible. In our view, this is one of\r\nthe most important contributions any country can make to\r\nnuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.\r\nThere is much else which the Agency has achieved\r\nover the past year that New Zealand would warmly\r\ncommend. We would highlight here, amongst other things,\r\nits efforts in support of the prevention of illicit trafficking\r\nin nuclear materials and other radioactive sources. The\r\nappearance of non-State actors with an interest in nuclear\r\ntechnology is a worrying trend, and we are pleased that the\r\nAgency is contributing to efforts to ensure that nuclear\r\nmaterial does not fall into the wrong hands. Unfortunately,\r\nwe can see that this is likely to be a growth area of work\r\nin the future.\r\nNew Zealand is also very supportive of the Agency for\r\nits continuing and impartial efforts in respect of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. As a member of\r\nthe Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization\r\n(KEDO), New Zealand welcomes the IAEA’s continued\r\nmonitoring of the freeze under the Agreed Framework.\r\nHowever, New Zealand remains deeply concerned at the\r\nlack of progress in the implementation of the safeguards\r\nagreement with the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, and we reiterate our calls for that country to return\r\nto full compliance with the safeguards agreement. That is\r\nthe expectation of the international community.\r\nSimilarly, New Zealand is fully supportive of the\r\nAgency’s endeavours in respect of Iraq. In that\r\nconnection, I would like to take this opportunity to note\r\nthat New Zealand is very concerned about recent\r\ndevelopments in Iraq, as reflected in operative paragraph\r\n7 of the draft resolution before us [A/52/L.13], which\r\nNew Zealand has co-sponsored. The Special Commission\r\nmust be allowed to continue its work without hindrance.\r\nFinally, I have pleasure in joining with other\r\nspeakers in paying tribute to Mr. Hans Blix, who has\r\nheaded the Agency for the past 16 years. We owe\r\nMr. Blix an immense debt of gratitude for his leadership,\r\nhis wisdom and his guidance. New Zealand looks forward\r\nto continuing its cooperation with the Agency, which we\r\nvalue so highly, under the incoming Director General,\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei. We are confident that under\r\nMr. ElBaradei the Agency will be well placed indeed to\r\nmeet the challenges that it will continue to face over the\r\ncoming years.\r\nMr. Jusys (Lithuania): It is a special honour and\r\npleasure for the Lithuanian delegation to wish the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a happy\r\nfortieth anniversary. The Agency has reached its golden\r\nage, in which mature wisdom and youthful energy make\r\nit the organization that it is — a unique, effective and\r\nrespectable world institution. We feel rightly proud to be\r\namong its members.\r\nWe owe a special and sincere tribute to the outgoing\r\nDirector General, Mr. Hans Blix. If we have anyone to\r\nthank for the Agency’s growing international authority, it\r\nis Mr. Blix. We wish the incoming Director General,\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, success in building on\r\nMr. Blix’s 16-year legacy, and we pledge our full support\r\nfor his future endeavours.\r\nI would like to thank the leadership of the IAEA for\r\nthe comprehensive report on its accomplishments in 1996\r\nand the additional information provided by the Director\r\nGeneral. We note a number of important resolutions\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nadopted during the recent General Conference of the\r\nAgency in its forty-first regular session.\r\nFor Lithuania, atomic energy is the focus of the\r\nhighest national interest. We have associated ourselves with\r\nthe European Union statement, which outlines the main\r\nthrust of our thoughts concerning this agenda item. I am\r\nhere today to underline the specifics of the issue from a\r\nLithuanian perspective.\r\nThe proportion of nuclear energy production to total\r\nenergy production in Lithuania is today is the highest in the\r\nworld. Last year nuclear energy production was 84 per cent\r\nof total produced energy. Nuclear energy is produced in one\r\nof the world’s most powerful nuclear plants, located near\r\nIgnalina in north-eastern Lithuania. Naturally, the safety of\r\nthe plant has been of primary importance to us.\r\nDue to the transparency policy adhered to by the\r\nLithuanian Government, international experts know\r\neverything about the plant’s two reactors. As a result, the\r\nsafety analysis report completed last year by the\r\ninternational consortium of experts became the first\r\ncomprehensive document on safety for the light boiling\r\nwater cooled graphite moderated pressure tube (RBMK)\r\nreactors.\r\nAnother fuse in the safety of the Ignalina plant is the\r\nknowledge, training and professionalism of those who\r\noperate it. Our experts have greatly benefitted from the\r\nIAEA technical cooperation programme and other bilateral\r\nprogrammes. Two weeks ago the Lithuanian Government\r\nsubmitted a draft law on the management of the Ignalina\r\nplant to the Parliament. It will be a modern Western-type\r\nstructure of governance designed by the IAEA utilization\r\nsafety mission, in cooperation with the Ignalina Safety Jury,\r\nset up under an agreement between the Lithuanian\r\nGovernment and the European Bank for Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment.\r\nSince nuclear safety concerns everyone, the Lithuania\r\nGovernment has developed programmes of public\r\nawareness and civil defence preparedness. Several weeks\r\nago Lithuania signed a multilateral memorandum on\r\ntechnical cooperation with the IAEA on preparedness for\r\nnuclear emergencies. This action will help to handle nuclear\r\naccidents, ensure that timely information is sent to and\r\nreceived from the international community and introduce\r\nadditional safety measures.\r\nBased on all the precautionary measures we have\r\ntaken with the help of our Western partners, particularly\r\nSweden, the Ignalina nuclear power plant is now one of\r\nthe safest plants in the world with RBMK-type reactors.\r\nNational nuclear safety measures must always be\r\naligned with international mechanisms that are instituted\r\nby and operate under relevant international agreements.\r\nLithuania is a party to many of these agreements. It is\r\nencouraging to see the increasing strength and growing\r\nnumber of such mechanisms.\r\nA year ago the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which\r\nLithuania has ratified, entered into force. Today the\r\nConvention is more operational, due to new rules of\r\nprocedure whereby all States must submit national reports\r\nfor review. We are preparing our report for the first\r\nreview meeting to be held in the spring of 1999.\r\nOther important landmarks in international nuclear\r\nsafety include the adoption of the Protocol to Amend the\r\nVienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage\r\nand the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for\r\nNuclear Damage. Lithuania was among the first\r\nsignatories to these major instruments. And we especially\r\nwelcome the signature of our neighbour, the Republic of\r\nBelarus, to the Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear\r\nDamage.\r\nToday the most significant challenge faced by\r\nLithuania and other States that utilize nuclear energy is\r\nthe interim storage and final repository of spent fuel. This\r\nchallenge must be tackled through the coordinated\r\ncooperation of all countries concerned. The timely\r\nadoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent\r\nFuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste\r\nManagement will greatly aid the effort. Not only did the\r\nJoint Convention come at the right time, but, more\r\nimportant, it is a comprehensive and verifiable\r\nconvention. Lithuania was among the first signatories to\r\nthis Convention as well.\r\nThe IAEA already has programmes in place for the\r\nmanagement of radioactive waste originating from\r\nmedicine, industry and agriculture. It is high time a\r\nsimilar programme was designed for the very core of the\r\nissue: spent nuclear fuel.\r\nThe spent nuclear fuel issue is also an international\r\nsecurity issue. If unaccounted for, this fuel can fall into\r\nthe wrong hands. We often talk about new security\r\nthreats, whether intentional or accidental, which States\r\nmust prevent through national measures. Lithuania has a\r\nspecial authority for nuclear energy safety which accounts\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nfor and controls all nuclear material, the bulk of which is\r\nspent nuclear fuel.\r\nWithout international cooperation and mechanisms, no\r\nState can achieve the safety of nuclear material on its own.\r\nWe acceded to the Convention on the Physical Protection\r\nof Nuclear Materials in 1994 and implemented it through\r\nnational measures in accordance with all relevant\r\ninternational standards.\r\nWhat is worse than uncontrolled nuclear waste is when\r\nnuclear material falls into the hands of those who might use\r\nit to threaten other States. In an effort to track nuclear\r\nmaterial, we support the operation of the IAEA database on\r\nillicit traffic incidents as well as the International Physical\r\nProtection Advisory Service. We also welcome\r\nreconfirmation by the world’s major Powers at the G-8\r\nDenver Summit this June that they will fight this dangerous\r\ntrafficking of nuclear material.\r\nThe IAEA is essential to nuclear disarmament. None\r\nof the relevant treaties would be effective without input\r\nfrom the Agency. In fact, without the IAEA, there would\r\nhardly be any progress in nuclear disarmament.\r\nThe Agency’s verification expertise is crucial to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\r\nthe cornerstone of nuclear weapons control. The IAEA is\r\ncritical to the maintenance of the nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzones. The Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Organization\r\nwill need to rely on the IAEA. If we succeed in taking the\r\nnext logical step and negotiate the fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty, the IAEA will surely have an important role in\r\nguiding efforts to ensure the effectiveness of that treaty as\r\nwell.\r\nLast year we felt safer when the Agency reported that\r\nno declared and safeguarded nuclear material had been\r\ndiverted for any military or unknown purpose. It is\r\nregrettable, however, that some States still remain outside\r\nthe NPT regime and IAEA safeguards. And it is worrisome\r\nthat some States have safeguards agreements in force with\r\nthe IAEA but do not enforce them, and are, in fact, under\r\nno safeguards surveillance.\r\nThere had been some progress in the case of Iraq. But\r\nrecent actions by the Iraqi authorities leave nothing but the\r\nhope of its compliance with the Security Council\r\nresolutions. It must allow the experts from the IAEA and\r\nthe United Nations Special Commission to inspect its\r\nfacilities. If Iraq and other States have nothing to hide, then\r\nthey should avoid taking actions that arouse suspicions of\r\ntheir covert activities.\r\nThe system of safeguards needs to be enhanced\r\nhorizontally and vertically. The progress in the latter\r\ndimension is evident. The Model Additional Protocol for\r\nthe application of the IAEA safeguards was relatively\r\nquickly adopted by the Board of Governors on 15 May\r\n1997. We are ready to sign an Additional Protocol, which\r\nis in addition to the agreement we have with the IAEA\r\nfor the application of safeguards signed in 1992. As a\r\nfirst step, Lithuania has allowed visa-free entry to the\r\nAgency’s inspectors.\r\nThere will most likely be many more ways for the\r\nIAEA to contribute to the goal of the ultimate elimination\r\nof nuclear weapons. As natural resources are diminished\r\nand the supply of nuclear fuel may come from dismantled\r\nwarheads, the IAEA is a link between disarmament and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe contribution of the IAEA extends further than\r\nnuclear disarmament and the development of nuclear\r\nenergy. The Agency commendably contributes to the\r\nprogress of medicine, agriculture and other applicable\r\nsciences.\r\nThe atom is one of the most environmentally\r\nfriendly sources of energy in spite of the risks associated\r\nwith its use, all of which can be dealt with successfully.\r\nIf we are to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, what\r\nother way is there but to rely on nuclear energy? We can\r\nall agree with what Mr. Blix said at the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly on 24 June:\r\n“Nuclear power, rather than being largely ignored or\r\nwritten off by reference to public concerns, would\r\ndeserve to be examined on its merits by United\r\nNations organs in search of a sustainable energy\r\nmix.” [Official Records of the General Assembly,\r\nNineteenth special session, 3rd plenary meeting,\r\np. 33]\r\nFinally, the draft resolution introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of Japan, Ambassador Owada, adequately\r\nreflects the current situation and prospects of IAEA\r\nactivities. We wish to see it adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Zaki (Pakistan): The Pakistan delegation would\r\nlike to convey its appreciation to the Director-General of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for his\r\nstatement this morning on the annual report of the\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nAgency for 1996. I would also like to convey our\r\ncompliments to the Agency for completing 40 years of\r\nuseful work. We hope that in the future the Agency will\r\npay greater attention to the needs of developing countries\r\nto benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nPakistan, as one of the founding members of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, can take justifiable\r\npride in its close association and fruitful cooperation with\r\nthe Agency since its establishment in 1957. During the past\r\nfour decades, Pakistan has both benefited from and\r\ncontributed to the work of the Agency.\r\nPakistan has participated actively in the Agency’s\r\npolicy-making organs, served for 24 years on its Board of\r\nGovernors and was twice elected as its Chairman.\r\nAdditionally, Pakistan has the honour of serving as the first\r\nChairman of the Agency’s Standing Advisory Group on\r\nTechnical Assistance and Cooperation.\r\nToday, Pakistan provides an outstanding example of\r\nthe IAEA’s success story in the peaceful uses of atomic\r\nenergy. Thanks to the catalytic effect of the Agency’s\r\ncooperation, the peaceful nuclear programme of Pakistan\r\nhas considerably advanced, having a significant socio-\r\neconomic impact.\r\nWhile supplementing our own efforts and resources\r\nwith IAEA’s technical assistance, we have established a\r\nbroad base of professional manpower, research institutes,\r\ntraining facilities, medical centres and other technical\r\nservices. We now have three centres specializing in the use\r\nof radiation and radioisotopes in agriculture. An institute of\r\nbiotechnology and genetic engineering is dedicated to\r\nresearch. Ten nuclear medical centres cater to a quarter-\r\nmillion patients every year, while two more centres are\r\nunder construction.\r\nIt is a source of great satisfaction for us to have\r\nsupported the Agency’s promotional activities. Despite our\r\nmeagre resources, we have freely shared our experience in\r\npeaceful nuclear technology with other developing countries\r\nby providing experts, offering placements in concerned\r\ninstitutions and hosting training courses. We will continue\r\nour contributions in these areas.\r\nPakistan shares the aspirations of the international\r\ncommunity to a nuclear-weapon-free world. Experience has\r\nshown that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones\r\nis a positive and significant step forward in that direction.\r\nOur proposal, initiated in 1974, for establishing a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in South Asia continues to demonstrate\r\nour commitment to seek peaceful modalities and\r\nagreements to promote the non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons in our region. The proposal is part of our\r\nendeavour to promote a comprehensive approach to\r\nresolving problems in South Asia, including the resolution\r\nof disputes and issues of security.\r\nBecause of the existing tensions in our region, the\r\nproblem of nuclear proliferation raises serious concerns.\r\nThe core cause of tension in South Asia is the Kashmir\r\ndispute and the brutal suppression and the denial of the\r\nright of self-determination of the Kashmiri people. The\r\nonly viable way to reduce this tension is to resolve the\r\nKashmir dispute in accordance with the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council’s resolutions. The reduction of tension\r\nis likely to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation in our\r\nregion and will hopefully contribute to promoting the\r\nobjective of non-proliferation.\r\nIn the context of non-proliferation, the IAEA’s\r\nsafeguards system has played an invaluable role. The\r\nBoard of Governors has now approved the adoption of a\r\nProtocol intended to strengthen the Agency’s capability to\r\ndetect undeclared activities in States with comprehensive\r\nsafeguards agreements. We shall follow with great interest\r\nthe concrete gains in effectiveness and cost-efficiency as\r\nthe system gets into full gear in the time-frame of 5 to 10\r\nyears.\r\nPakistan has always supported the Agency’s efforts\r\nto strengthen safeguards measures and has actively\r\nparticipated in the discussions on its safeguards\r\nstrengthening the programme “93+2”. However, Pakistan,\r\nas a country not party to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), is not obliged\r\nto accept the measures of safeguards in the Model\r\nProtocol. Pakistan will fully abide by its safeguards\r\nobligations by honouring the present safeguards\r\nagreements.\r\nNuclear safety is being continually enhanced\r\ntechnically and reinforced legally. A major initiative in\r\nthis regard is the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which\r\nspecifically addresses the safety of nuclear power stations.\r\nPakistan was one of the first signatories of this\r\nConvention and has also ratified it. It is our sincere hope\r\nand expectation that the national reporting and peer\r\nreview process envisaged in the Convention will\r\nstrengthen both national commitment and international\r\ncooperation in this important field.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nThe promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy is\r\nthe raison d’être of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency. Despite the negative public perception created in\r\nsome countries and the fears aroused about the dangers of\r\nnuclear proliferation, nuclear energy remains a viable and\r\nattractive energy option for many countries, and particularly\r\nfor the fossil fuel-deficient developing countries.\r\nSince energy is a vital input to the development\r\nprocess, the energy consumption per capita is bound to rise\r\nsteeply in developing countries. If this increase in energy\r\ndemand is to be met by fossil fuel, which seems inevitable\r\nin the near term, there will be an unacceptable burden of\r\ncarbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides on the atmosphere. A\r\nmassive deployment of hydropower can ease the situation\r\nto some extent, but the only proven and sustainable option\r\nis the use of nuclear heat and nuclear electricity. Despite\r\nChernobyl, the safety record of the nuclear industry is\r\nunmatched by any other major enterprise. Opposition to\r\nnuclear power is thus either based on misunderstanding or\r\nperhaps a deliberate pretext to deny this technology to the\r\nless favoured countries.\r\nTo encourage and promote the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear power, the basic requirement would be to provide\r\ntechnical assistance and cooperation to the concerned\r\ncountries. The regulatory responsibility of the Agency\r\nshould not lead to the imposition of arbitrary restrictions on\r\nthe transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\r\nThe Agency should adopt non-discriminatory measures in\r\nproviding access to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in\r\norder to facilitate the achievement of the overall objective\r\nof a safe, clean and secure world.\r\nAs regards the long-standing issue of the size and\r\ncomposition of the Agency’s Board of Governors, there is\r\nnow a general agreement among member States that the\r\nefficiency, representativity and credibility of the Board\r\nwould be enhanced by a well-considered addition of active\r\nstakeholders. We earnestly hope that a just solution to this\r\nissue will be agreed upon in the near future so that the\r\nunderrepresented regions are given their rightful share in\r\nthe membership of the Board. Pakistan will continue its\r\ncooperation with other member States for reaching a\r\ngenerally agreed formula for the expansion of the Board.\r\nWhile the provision of technical assistance is the\r\ncornerstone of the Agency’s work, any curtailment or roll-\r\nback of technical cooperation activities would constitute a\r\nretrogressive step. It would upset the balance that has so\r\nhappily existed between the regulatory and promotional\r\nroles of the Agency. Such an eventuality would tend to\r\ndistort the statutory mandate of the Organization. The two\r\nfunctions must therefore go hand in hand.\r\nThe role played so far by the Agency in upgrading\r\nthe scientific profile of developing member States is\r\ncommendable. However, continued efforts and mutual\r\nunderstanding among the industrialized and developing\r\nmember States will be required to enable the Agency to\r\nlive up to the expectations of member States.\r\nAdditionally, a commitment governed not only by rules\r\nand regulations but largely by objectives and aspirations\r\nshould influence the Agency’s future.\r\nAs the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\ncelebrates its fortieth anniversary, we would like to\r\ncongratulate it for the progress it has achieved towards\r\nmeeting the objectives laid down in its statute. Above all,\r\nwe wish the Agency many more decades of distinction in\r\nthe service of mankind.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I would first like to express to Mr. Hans Blix,\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), the gratitude of and recognition by the\r\nGovernment of Kuwait for his very valuable contribution\r\nat the head of this important international agency. I would\r\nalso like to address my most sincere congratulations to\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei on his election to the post of\r\nDirector General of the IAEA. We are convinced that\r\nMr. ElBaradai will be equal to the important\r\nresponsibilities of this post.\r\nKuwait supports unreservedly the important tasks\r\nperformed by the IAEA since its establishment, convinced\r\nas we are of the importance of its role and\r\nresponsibilities. The Agency cannot be successful in its\r\nactivities without the cooperation of the members of the\r\ninternational community in support of its work. In this\r\nregard, Kuwait commends the contents of the annual\r\nreport of the IAEA, presented to the General Assembly\r\nby the Director General, a document that has been\r\nsubmitted through document A/52/285.\r\nWe welcome the Agency’s interest in the uses of\r\natomic energy for peaceful purposes and for economic\r\ndevelopment, bearing in mind in particular the great\r\ntechnological progress in the use of this energy —\r\nespecially in the areas of electric-power production and\r\nheating water.\r\nKuwait also notes with interest the progress made by\r\nthe Agency in applying modern techniques in the area of\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nfood security through the use of atomic energy in the agro-\r\nfood sector.\r\nThe Government of Kuwait follows with great interest\r\nthe international efforts aimed at the non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons. Kuwait therefore signed, on 24 September\r\n1997, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which\r\nhad been adopted by the General Assembly in September\r\n1996. We hope that this Treaty will mark the beginning of\r\ngeneral nuclear disarmament.\r\nWe are also greatly interested in IAEA activities in the\r\napplication of the safeguards system, which aims to curb\r\nthe use of nuclear applications for military purposes. We\r\nnote with satisfaction the Agency’s progress in enhancing\r\nthe safeguards system.\r\nAs I pointed out at the beginning of my statement,\r\nputting an end to the arms race entails concerted\r\ninternational efforts for the objective of halting the arms\r\nrace. The Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-\r\nFree Zone and the Pelindaba Treaty, which created a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa, are two examples of\r\nthe implementation of the principle of halting the arms race\r\nand nuclear non-proliferation. In this respect, we hope that\r\nthe region of the Middle East will also be declared a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. However, the refusal of Israel to\r\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and to place its nuclear facilities under the\r\nsafeguards system constitutes the main obstacle to the\r\nrealization of this objective. While welcoming the Director\r\nGeneral’s efforts to arrive at this objective, we would urge\r\nhim to continue those efforts resolutely.\r\nKuwait strongly supports the important efforts\r\nundertaken by the IAEA and its inspection teams in\r\napplying the permanent monitoring and verification system\r\nwhich was established by the Agency after the Iraqi\r\naggression against Kuwait. In fact, it is an essential\r\ninstrument to prevent any attempt on the part of the Iraqi\r\nGovernment to obtain materials which would enable it to\r\nproceed with its armaments programme aimed at producing\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the IAEA and its\r\ninspection teams, and we fully endorse the considerable\r\nefforts made by the United Nations Special Commission,\r\nwhich is charged with destroying Iraqi weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. In this connection, we welcome the new\r\nChairman of the Special Commission, Mr. Richard Butler,\r\nwho is competently and devotedly pursuing the\r\ncommendable work set up by his predecessor, Mr. Rolf\r\nEkéus. We are likewise convinced of the importance of\r\nthe role of the Special Commission inspectors in ensuring\r\npeace and stability in the region and in ensuring that it\r\nremains free of arms of mass destruction.\r\nWe are also following closely the development of\r\nthe situation concerning the confrontation between the\r\nSecurity Council and Iraq — which has wished to impose\r\nconditions and restrictions aimed at hampering the work\r\nof the Special Commission charged with the destruction\r\nof Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Iraq’s actions are a\r\nchallenge to the decisions of the international community\r\nand threaten to escalate tensions in the Gulf region.\r\nWe reaffirm that Iraq must comply fully with all the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council in order to ensure\r\nstability in the region. We think that the Council must\r\nadopt a united and firm position to find a solution to this\r\ncrisis, which has direct consequences for peace and\r\nsecurity in the region. The Secretary-General had\r\ntherefore offered a way out to Iraq to allow it to\r\nreexamine its decision to defy the Security Council and\r\nthe international community. Unfortunately, Iraq has not\r\nseized that opportunity. We thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his noble effort.\r\nKuwait is a State that aspires to peace, security and\r\nstability. We will not abandon the dream that is shared by\r\nall peoples of the world: to eliminate weapons of mass\r\ndestruction from our beautiful planet.\r\nWhen Kuwait speaks of its fears concerning\r\nweapons of mass destruction, it is on the basis of an\r\nexperience of its own, whose repercussions continue to\r\naffect it. For that reason, Kuwait calls on the international\r\ncommunity jointly to exploit the tremendous energy\r\nresources at its disposal in order to build a world in\r\nwhich peace, not strife, reigns and in which peoples could\r\nenjoy the fruits of development, far from the uncertainties\r\nof war and destruction — a world that believes in the link\r\nbetween peace, stability, development and the exploitation\r\nof our God-given energy resources in the interest of the\r\nprosperity and well-being of all the world’s peoples.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: The next meeting of the General\r\nCommittee will be held on Friday morning, 21 November,\r\nat 9.30 a.m. in Conference Room 4 to consider a request\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 12 November 1997\r\nby Jamaica for the inclusion of an additional item entitled\r\n“Admission of the International Seabed Authority to\r\nMembership in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension\r\nFund”, which is contained in document A/52/233 and\r\nAddendum 1.\r\nI should also like to inform members that the\r\nprogramme of work covering the remainder of November\r\nand the first two weeks of December has just been issued\r\nas document A/INF/52/3/Add.2 and is being distributed to\r\ndelegations in the Hall.\r\nThe list of speakers for each of the items listed in that\r\ndocument is now open.\r\nThe General Assembly will be kept informed, in due\r\ncourse, of the dates for the consideration of other agenda\r\nitems as well as of any additions or changes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\n31\r\n"
