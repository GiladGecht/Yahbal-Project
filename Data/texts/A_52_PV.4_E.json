(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 11.05 a.m.\r\nItem 8 of the provisional agenda\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work: first\r\nreport of the General Committee (A/52/250)\r\nThe President: This morning, the Assembly will\r\nconsider the first report of the General Committee, which\r\nhas been circulated in document A/52/250. I will refer to\r\nspecific sections and paragraphs of the report which contain\r\nrecommendations for consideration by the Assembly.\r\nIn paragraph 2 of its report, the General Committee\r\ndraws the attention of the General Assembly to the\r\nprovisions reproduced in annexes V, VI, VII and VIII to its\r\nrules of procedure.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of those\r\nprovisions? I see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 3, the General\r\nCommittee took note of General Assembly resolution\r\n48/264 of 29 July 1994, entitled “Revitalization of the work\r\nof the General Assembly”, and of annex I thereto, entitled\r\n“Guidelines on the rationalization of the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly”. The General Committee also took note\r\nof annex I to General Assembly resolution 50/227 of\r\n24 May 1996, entitled “Further measures for the\r\nrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the\r\neconomic, social and related fields”. The provisions of the\r\nresolutions are reflected in the document before the\r\nGeneral Assembly under the relevant headings.\r\nWe shall now examine section II of the report,\r\nwhich deals with the organization of the session.\r\nWe turn first to section II.B, which deals with the\r\nrationalization of work of the General Assembly. In\r\nparagraph 6, the General Committee draws the attention\r\nof the General Assembly to paragraph 5 of the annex to\r\nresolution 45/45, regarding certain Main Committees\r\nmeeting in sequential order, and to paragraph 23 of\r\nannex I of resolution 50/227, concerning the discussions\r\nin the Second and Third Committees, which, to the extent\r\nfeasible, should not commence until after the end of the\r\ngeneral debate in the plenary meetings of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note\r\nof paragraph 6? I see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 7, the General\r\nCommittee took note of the fact that measures introduced\r\nto reduce costs relating to overtime would be strictly\r\nenforced.\r\nIn section II.C, which relates to the closing date of\r\nthe fifty-second session, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the General Assembly that the fifty-\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 19 September 1997\r\nsecond session recess not later than Tuesday, 16 December\r\nthis year.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nI see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 9, the General\r\nCommittee draws the attention of the General Assembly to\r\nthe fact that the closing date of the fifty-second session will\r\nbe subject to the implementation of resolution 51/241 of 31\r\nJuly 1997 on the strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nparagraph 9?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 10, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the Assembly that all the Main\r\nCommittees should make every effort to complete their\r\nwork by Friday, 28 November 1997.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nI see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Next, we turn to section II.D,\r\nconcerning the schedule of meetings. With regard to\r\nparagraph 11, the General Committee recommends to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that morning meetings should start at\r\n10 a.m. promptly for all plenary meetings and meetings of\r\nthe Main Committees.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should also like to remind members\r\nthat, for afternoon meetings, I intend to begin promptly at\r\n3 p.m.\r\nIn the same paragraph, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the Assembly that, as a cost-saving\r\nmeasure, plenary meetings and meetings of the Main\r\nCommittees, including informal consultations, be\r\nadjourned by 6 p.m. and that no meetings be held on\r\nweekends. The Committee further recommends to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that this cost-saving measure should\r\nalso apply, for the remainder of 1997, to meetings on the\r\ncalendar of conferences and meetings.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly approves\r\nthis recommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 12, the General\r\nCommittee recommends that, in order to avoid the late\r\nstart of meetings, the General Assembly should waive the\r\nrequirement of the presence of at least one third of the\r\nmembers to declare a plenary meeting open and permit\r\nthe debate to proceed, and of at least one quarter of the\r\nmembers to declare a meeting of a Main Committee open\r\nand permit the debate to proceed.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly approves\r\nthis recommendation?\r\nI see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: For that matter, I should like to\r\nendorse strongly the practical suggestions that were made\r\nat previous sessions, for each delegation to designate\r\nsomeone to be present at the scheduled time. I genuinely\r\nhope that all delegations will cooperate.\r\nIn paragraph 13, the General Committee\r\nrecommends to the General Assembly that delegations\r\nshould be reminded of the utmost importance of\r\npunctuality.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nI see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I sincerely hope that all delegations\r\nwill make a special effort to cooperate in this regard so\r\nthat all meetings can start promptly at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 19 September 1997\r\nIn section II.E, concerning the general debate, the\r\nGeneral Committee recommends that the general debate\r\nbegin on Monday, 22 September, and end by Friday, 10\r\nOctober 1997. The General Committee also recommends\r\nthat the list of speakers in the general debate be closed on\r\nWednesday, 24 September, at 6 p.m.\r\nMay I consider that the General Assembly approves\r\nthe recommendations contained in paragraph 14?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In view of the very large number of\r\nspeakers already inscribed, I urge representatives to speak\r\nin the general debate in the order in which they appear on\r\nthe list of speakers. Those who are unable to speak at the\r\nscheduled time will be put at the end of the list for that\r\nmeeting.\r\nIn paragraph 15, the General Committee draws the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s attention to a previous decision of the\r\nAssembly to prohibit the practice of expressing\r\ncongratulations inside the General Assembly Hall after a\r\nspeech has been delivered. The Committee recommends\r\nthat this provision should also apply during the fifty-second\r\nsession.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nI see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Committee also\r\nrecommends to the General Assembly that, after delivering\r\ntheir statements, speakers in the general debate should leave\r\nthe General Assembly Hall through room GA-200, which\r\nis located behind the podium, before returning to their\r\nseats.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves this\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We shall now turn to section II.F.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of the\r\nprovisions concerning explanation of vote and right of reply\r\ncontained in paragraph 16?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I further take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to limit points of order to\r\nfive minutes, as recommended in paragraph 17?\r\nI see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of the provisions regarding the length of\r\nstatements contained in paragraph 18?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.G deals with records of\r\nmeetings.\r\nIn paragraph 19, the General Committee took note\r\nof the fact that verbatim records would be provided\r\nduring the fifty-second session for the plenary meetings\r\nof the General Assembly and meetings of the First\r\nCommittee, and that summary records would be provided\r\nfor the meetings of the General Committee and the other\r\nMain Committees of the Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves the\r\nrecommendation contained in paragraph 19 concerning\r\ntranscriptions of the debates of some of the meetings of\r\nthe Special Political and Decolonization Committee\r\n(Fourth Committee)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\napproves the recommendation also contained in paragraph\r\n19 that the practice not to reproduce in extenso statements\r\nmade in a Main Committee be maintained for the fifty-\r\nsecond session?\r\nI see no objection.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.H concerns concluding\r\nstatements in the General Assembly and the Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nI take it that the General Assembly takes note of this\r\nsection?\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 19 September 1997\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.I concerns resolutions.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nthe provisions contained in paragraphs 21 to 25?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.J concerns documentation.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nthe provision relating to reports of the Secretary-General or\r\nsubsidiary organs contained in paragraph 26?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 27, the General\r\nCommittee also draws the attention of the General\r\nAssembly to paragraph 6 of its resolution 48/264 and to\r\nparagraph 4 of its resolution 50/206 C, which emphasize\r\nthat documentation should be available in accordance with\r\nthe six-week rule for the distribution of documents\r\nsimultaneously in each of the six official languages of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of\r\nparagraph 27?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 28, the General\r\nCommittee took note of the fact that, as announced earlier,\r\na target has been set for an early reduction in the\r\ndocumentation produced by the Secretariat and that the\r\nvolume of pre-session documentation for the fifty-second\r\nsession is projected at a level slightly below that of\r\nprevious comparable years.\r\nIn this connection, I urge members of the Assembly to\r\nmake a special effort during this session, taking into\r\nconsideration especially the provisions of resolution 51/241\r\non the strengthening of the United Nations system, to\r\nexercise restraint in making proposals requesting new\r\nreports of the Secretary-General and to consider integrating,\r\nbiennializing or triennializing the presentation of reports.\r\nSection II.K refers to questions relating to the\r\nprogramme budget. May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly takes note of the provisions contained in\r\nparagraphs 29 and 30?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 31, which concerns\r\nsub-paragraph 13 (d) of decision 34/401, the General\r\nCommittee draws the Assembly’s attention to the\r\nobservations by the Secretary-General that the preparation\r\nof a statement of programme budget implications by the\r\nSecretary-General may take a few days. In addition, the\r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions and the Fifth Committee need adequate time to\r\nreview the programme budget implications of a draft\r\nresolution before the draft resolution can be acted on by\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General thus considers it desirable that\r\nMember States submit proposals sufficiently in advance\r\nto avoid the cancellation of meetings and the\r\npostponement of consideration of items.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes notes of the\r\nobservations of the Secretary-General set out in paragraph\r\n31?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Section II.L concerns observances\r\nand commemorative meetings. We turn first to paragraph\r\n32. The General Committee recommends that, allowing\r\nfor the necessary flexibility and with the exception of the\r\nanniversary of the United Nations, the General Assembly\r\nshould adopt the suggested format for commemorative\r\nmeetings, including limiting each statement to 15 minutes.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves the\r\nrecommendations contained in paragraph 32?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly also\r\napproves the recommendation contained in paragraph 33\r\nregarding the scheduling of observances and\r\ncommemorative meetings?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I now invite the General Assembly\r\nto turn to section II.M, which refers to special\r\nconferences. May I take it that the Assembly approves the\r\nrecommendations referred to in paragraphs 34 and 35?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 19 September 1997\r\nThe President: In section II.N, concerning meetings\r\nof subsidiary organs, the General Committee recommends\r\nto the General Assembly, on the strict understanding that\r\nmeetings would have to be accommodated within available\r\nfacilities and services, that the subsidiary organs referred to\r\nin paragraph 36 be authorized to meet during the main part\r\nof the fifty-second session.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We turn now to section III, which\r\ncontains observations on the organization of future sessions\r\nof the General Assembly. In paragraph 38, the General\r\nCommittee draws the attention of the General Assembly to\r\nresolution 51/241, entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations system”, adopted by the General Assembly on 31\r\nJuly 1997 and to be implemented as of 1 January 1998. The\r\nattention of the General Assembly is drawn especially to\r\nsection VI of the annex to the resolution, concerning the\r\ntiming of the plenary meetings of the General Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note of\r\nparagraph 38?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We turn now to section IV of the\r\nreport of the General Committee, relating to the adoption of\r\nthe agenda. This section starts with paragraph 39.\r\nI would first recall rule 23 of the rules of procedure,\r\nwhich provides that:\r\n“Debate on the inclusion of an item in the\r\nagenda, when that item has been recommended for\r\ninclusion by the General Committee, shall be limited\r\nto three speakers in favour of, and three against, the\r\ninclusion.”\r\nI should like to stress that at this time we are not\r\ndiscussing the substance of any item.\r\nWith regard to paragraph 40, may I consider that it is\r\nthe wish of the Assembly to direct its Main Committees to\r\nreview their agendas with a view to streamlining their\r\nprogrammes of work, as suggested in that paragraph?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Again, may I urge members of the\r\nAssembly to give careful thought to the suggestion by the\r\nSecretary-General, taking into account especially\r\nparagraph 24 of the annex to resolution 51/241, to\r\nconsider deferring to a later session items for which\r\ndecisions and action are not required at the present\r\nsession.\r\nIn paragraph 41, the General Committee\r\nrecommends that the consideration of item 94 of the draft\r\nagenda, “Question of the Malagasy islands of Glorieuses,\r\nJuan de Nova, Europa and Bassas da India”, should be\r\ndeferred to the fifty-third session and that the item should\r\nbe included in the provisional agenda of that session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 42, the General\r\nCommittee recommends that the consideration of item 95\r\nof the draft agenda, “Question of East Timor”, should be\r\ndeferred to the fifty-third session and that the item should\r\nbe included in the provisional agenda of that session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In respect of paragraph 43, in\r\nconnection with item 157, “Draft guiding principles for\r\ninternational negotiations”, the General Committee\r\nrecommends its inclusion as a sub-item of item 148 of the\r\ndraft agenda, “United Nations Decade of International\r\nLaw”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In respect of paragraph 44, in\r\nconnection with item 158, “Amendment to article 13 of\r\nthe statute of the United Nations Administrative\r\nTribunal”, the General Committee recommends its\r\ninclusion in the agenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 19 September 1997\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In respect of paragraph 45, the\r\nGeneral Committee decided not to recommend the inclusion\r\nof item 159, “Need to review General Assembly resolution\r\n2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971 owing to the fundamental\r\nchange in the international situation and to the coexistence\r\nof two Governments across the Taiwan Strait”.\r\nIn respect of paragraph 46, in connection with item\r\n160 “Towards a culture of peace”, the General Committee\r\nrecommends its inclusion in the agenda of the current\r\nsession.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In respect of paragraph 47, in\r\nconnection with item 162, “Observer status for the Andean\r\nCommunity in the General Assembly”, the General\r\nCommittee recommends its inclusion in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We turn now to the agenda which the\r\nGeneral Committee recommends for adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn accordance with past practice, we shall follow the\r\nnumbering given in paragraph 48 of the General\r\nCommittee’s report (A/52/250), and, where it seems\r\nappropriate, we shall consider items in groups. I should like\r\nto remind members once again that at present we are not\r\ndiscussing the substance of any item, except when such\r\ndiscussion can assist the Assembly in deciding whether or\r\nnot to include an item in the agenda.\r\nItems 1 to 6 have already been dealt with.\r\nWe now turn to items 7 to 47. May I remind members\r\nthat we are dealing only with the question of the inclusion\r\nof the items.\r\nMay I take it that these items are included in the\r\nagenda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that items 48 to 61 are\r\nincluded in the agenda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I now invite members to turn to\r\nitems 62 to 83 relating to disarmament.

May I take it that this\r\nitem is included in the agenda?\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 19 September 1997\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Next, we turn to item 156, entitled\r\n“Towards a culture of peace”.

We shall take\r\nup the recommendations one by one.\r\nBefore we proceed, may I remind members that the\r\nitem numbers refer to the agenda in paragraph 48 of the\r\nreport before us, namely, document A/52/250.\r\nWe turn first to the recommendation in paragraph 50\r\n(a)(i), which concerns item 10. May I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly approves that recommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We turn now to the recommendation\r\nin paragraph 50 (a) (ii) relating to item 18. May I take it\r\nthat the General Assembly adopts that recommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Next, we turn to the recommendation\r\nin paragraph 50 (a) (iii) concerning item 48. May I take it\r\nthat the General Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In connection with paragraph 50\r\n(a) (iv), relating to item 61, the General Committee\r\nrecommends that the General Assembly allocate the item\r\nat an appropriate time during the session. May I take it\r\nthat the General Assembly approves the recommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We turn now to paragraph 50 (a) (v)\r\nrelating to item 156, entitled “Towards a culture of\r\npeace”. May I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to consider the item directly in plenary\r\nmeeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We next turn to paragraph 50 (a)(vi)\r\nrelating to item 158, entitled “Observer status for the\r\nAndean Community in the General Assembly”. May I\r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to\r\nconsider the item directly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We now turn to the recommendation\r\nin paragraph 50 (b), relating to item 71, entitled “General\r\nand complete disarmament”. May I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly approves this recommendation\r\npertaining to item 71?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Next, we turn to the\r\nrecommendation in paragraph 50 (c) relating to item 105,\r\nentitled “Advancement of Women”.

May I take it that it is the wish of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that the item should be allocated to the\r\nSixth Committee as a sub-item of item 146?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We next turn to paragraph 50 (e)(ii)\r\nrelating to item 155, entitled, “Amendment to article 13 of\r\nthe statute of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal”.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to allocate\r\nthe item to the Sixth Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We shall now turn to paragraph 51 of\r\nthe report of the General Committee.\r\nMr. Kamal (Pakistan): It is our understanding that, in\r\nallocating item 62 to the plenary, we are in no way\r\nprejudging the mechanism to be set up subsequently for the\r\nproper and detailed consideration of the issue. This can be\r\neither the plenary itself, a committee of the whole, a\r\nworking group or the relevant Main Committees. It is also\r\nour understanding that the plenary itself will decide on the\r\nissue of the mechanism after the general debate.\r\nThe President: I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto inform the General Assembly that the President is now\r\nundertaking very extensive consultations, since this issue\r\nwas raised in the meeting of the General Committee, to\r\ndetermine the mechanism of the consideration of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on reform of the United Nations.\r\nCertainly, the Assembly in plenary meeting will make a\r\ndecision on the format of the mechanism on this issue.\r\nI now invite members to turn to the list of items\r\nrecommended by the General Committee for consideration\r\nin plenary meeting.\r\nTaking into account the decisions just adopted, may I\r\nconsider that the General Assembly approves the allocation\r\nof the items listed in paragraph 51 of the report of the\r\nGeneral Committee for consideration directly in plenary\r\nmeeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of the United\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Rosenstock (United States of America): We\r\nwish to associate ourselves with your comments,\r\nMr. President, concerning the treatment of item 62, which\r\nhas, of course, been referred to plenary meeting for future\r\nconsideration. That was a decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly at this session.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the representative\r\nof France.\r\nMr. Legal (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nMy comments are not related to the issue raised by the\r\ntwo previous speakers, but to the fact that, with regard to\r\nparagraph 51 of the version of the text from which I am\r\nworking, the text distributed to us is incomplete. It\r\ncontains the allocation of items for plenary meetings, First\r\nCommittee and Fourth Committee, but it does not contain\r\nthe text of the allocation of items to the Second, Third,\r\nFifth or Sixth Committees.\r\nIn principle, in such a case as this my delegation\r\nwould not be in a position to associate itself with the\r\nadoption of the recommendations proposed to us in the\r\nreport of the General Committee. We are therefore in a\r\ndifficult position. However, the Secretariat has apologized\r\nto us and has indicated that the corrected version of the\r\ntext — at least, the French version — will be given to us\r\nwithout delay.\r\nHaving expressed my reservations, and given the\r\nassurances provided to us, I do not want to create\r\nproblems for the adoption of the recommendations in\r\nparagraph 51 in this exceptional case. I understand that\r\nthe staff of the Secretariat make a great effort, working\r\ncarefully and to the best of their abilities to provide us\r\nwith good documentation, so I do not want to complicate\r\ntheir lives. However, I believe that this incident is\r\nrevealing of the fact that the staff of the General\r\nAssembly and of the documentation and language services\r\nare working under excessive pressure. This type of\r\nincident shows that there are limits to the pressure that\r\none can impose on staff. I believe that our friends in the\r\nSecretariat are working hard; perhaps they are working\r\ntoo hard, and this is the result of such overwork.\r\nI do not want to aggravate matters for them — if I\r\nmay be permitted to use that expression — so I will let\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 19 September 1997\r\nthis pass. But I trust that the definitive corrected version\r\nwill be given to us as soon as possible. We have been\r\ngiven the text in English, but of course the English text\r\ncannot suffice.\r\nThe President: I should like to assure the\r\nrepresentative of France that the Secretariat and the\r\npresidency will undertake all necessary measures to have all\r\ndocuments issued in all the official languages of the\r\nOrganization promptly and on time. As the Assembly is\r\nwell aware, this bulky document was approved only\r\nyesterday by the General Committee, and I convened the\r\nplenary meeting at 11 o’clock instead of at 10 o’clock, as\r\noriginally scheduled, to provide an opportunity for the\r\ndocumentation and other services of the Secretariat to issue\r\nall the documents. However, that has not been the case. I\r\ncan assure delegations that the Secretariat and I will do our\r\nbest to have documents issued on time. I am grateful to the\r\ndistinguished representative of France for his cooperation\r\nand understanding of the situation.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of\r\nSwaziland.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): I wish to echo the spirit of\r\nunderstanding that you, Mr. President, expressed towards\r\nthe delegation of France, which has received by mistake a\r\ndocument that is not in its language, one of the official\r\nlanguages of the United Nations. I am sure that in the near\r\nfuture the United Nations will have to reconsider the\r\nquestion of languages very carefully, especially given the\r\nfact that now there are so many Members of this body\r\nwhose languages are not regarded as languages because\r\nthey are not among the six that are used. I, for instance,\r\nwould like to speak my language, siSwati, here, in order to\r\nexpress myself better in debates. However, we appreciate\r\nthe understanding offered to the delegation of France.\r\nIn addition, I wish to make the observation that a\r\ndocument of this significance should in future be made\r\nready before we come here to adopt the recommendations\r\nin the report. In my view, this would allow delegations to\r\nperuse the document, see the mistakes and inadvertent\r\nomissions and also, perhaps, see where we could make the\r\nnecessary changes so that the document could be adopted\r\nholistically. But when we receive the document only when\r\nwe arrive here it gives us very little time to understand\r\nfully the proposals that we are to adopt. The mistake\r\nobserved by France, for instance, could have been observed\r\nyesterday instead of today.\r\nThe President: Let us now turn to the allocation of\r\nagenda items to the Main Committees. We come first to\r\nthe list of items which the General Committee has\r\nrecommended for allocation to the First Committee.\r\nTaking into account the decisions just adopted, may\r\nI take it that the General Assembly approves the\r\nallocation of the items proposed for the First Committee\r\nin paragraph 51 of the report of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We turn now to the list of items\r\nwhich the General Committee recommends for allocation\r\nto the Special Political and Decolonization Committee\r\n(Fourth Committee).\r\nTaking into account the decisions just adopted, may\r\nI consider that the General Assembly approves the\r\nallocation of items proposed for the Special Political and\r\nDecolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) in\r\nparagraph 51 of the report of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We come now to the list of items\r\nwhich the General Committee has recommended for\r\nallocation to the Second Committee.\r\nTaking into account the decisions just adopted, may\r\nI consider that the General Assembly approves the\r\nallocation of items proposed for the Second Committee in\r\nparagraph 51 of the report of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: We turn now to the list of items\r\nwhich the General Committee recommends for allocation\r\nto the Third Committee.\r\nTaking into account the decisions just adopted, may\r\nI take it that the General Assembly approves the\r\nallocation of items to the Third Committee as proposed in\r\nparagraph 51 of the report of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Next, we come to the list of items\r\nwhich the General Committee recommends for allocation\r\nto the Fifth Committee.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 4th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 19 September 1997\r\nTaking into account the decisions just adopted, may I\r\ntake it that the General Assembly approves the allocation of\r\nitems to the Fifth Committee as proposed in paragraph 51\r\nof the report of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Lastly, we come to the list of items\r\nwhich the General Committee recommends for allocation to\r\nthe Sixth Committee.\r\nTaking into account the decisions just adopted, may I\r\ntake it that the General Assembly approves the allocation of\r\nitems proposed to the Sixth Committee in paragraph 51 of\r\nthe report of the General Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded its consideration of the first report of the General\r\nCommittee.\r\nI wish to thank all the members of the Assembly for\r\ntheir cooperation. Each Main Committee will receive the\r\nlist of agenda items allocated to it so that it may begin its\r\nwork as soon as possible, in accordance with rule 99 of\r\nthe rules of procedure.\r\nBefore we adjourn, I wish to recall and underline\r\nthat all meetings must start punctually, at 10 a.m. and\r\n3 p.m. Kindly note that all Main Committees should\r\ncomplete their work by 28 November, and the plenary\r\nshould recess by 16 December. I hope the Main\r\nCommittees will continue with the effort they\r\ndemonstrated in the fifty-first session in concluding their\r\nwork on time. I personally intend to ensure that we all\r\nkeep to our commitment taken today.\r\nThis undertaking also applies to the Secretariat,\r\nwhich must ensure that all documentation in all languages\r\nis in time for meetings to proceed without any delay.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.50 a.m.\r\n10\r\n"
