(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nStatements on the occasion of the eighth Africa\r\nIndustrialization Day\r\nThe President: Before turning to the items on the\r\nagenda for this morning, I should like to remind the\r\nGeneral Assembly that today is the eighth Africa\r\nIndustrialization Day.\r\nSince its proclamation by the General Assembly eight\r\nyears ago, Africa Industrialization Day has been celebrated\r\non 20 November. Today, it gives me great pleasure to join\r\nin the commemoration of this event.\r\nWhat are we celebrating on Africa Industrialization\r\nDay? First, we are celebrating the valiant efforts of the\r\npeoples of Africa to achieve a better life for themselves\r\nthrough industrial development. Secondly, the celebration\r\nof this event serves as an important reminder of the need to\r\ndraw world attention to the industrial development of\r\nAfrica. Thirdly, Africa Industrialization Day symbolizes the\r\nsolidarity of the international community with the countries\r\nin Africa. Above all, it reaffirms the principle of\r\npartnership and shared responsibility between Africa and\r\nthe international community in the industrial development\r\nof the continent.\r\nFor many years, the United Nations has actively\r\nsupported African countries in their efforts to eradicate\r\npoverty and achieve sustainable economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. The New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s, the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, the Industrial Development\r\nDecade for Africa and the newly launched Alliance for\r\nAfrica\u0027s Industrialization are some of the major\r\nprogrammes and initiatives that come to mind.\r\nCollectively, they underscore the commitment of the\r\ninternational community to Africa\u0027s development. An\r\nintegral part of this commitment is the promotion and\r\nacceleration of Africa\u0027s industrial development. Based on\r\nthe experience of the rich industrialized and the newly\r\nindustrializing countries, there is increased recognition\r\nthat industrialization holds the key to the transformation\r\nof Africa from poverty to prosperity.\r\nThe continuing decline of the industrial sector\r\ndespite growing signs of economic recovery in many\r\nAfrican countries has therefore been a cause for serious\r\nconcern. As a consequence of the poor performance of\r\nthe industrial sector, the share of sub-Saharan Africa in\r\nglobal manufacturing production has dropped from 0.6\r\nper cent in 1970 to 0.3 per cent in 1995. The share of\r\nmanufactured products in total African exports has barely\r\nchanged over the last two decades and is still below 10\r\nper cent. Moreover, four-fifths of sub-Saharan Africa\u0027s\r\nindustrial production is classified as low-technology.\r\nThis disturbing trend has contributed to the widening\r\nindustrialization and technological gap between Africa\r\nand the rest of the world. It has raised considerable\r\nconcern about the ability of African industry to compete\r\nin a highly competitive global economic environment.\r\nAfrica\u0027s leaders recognized the need to take collective and\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\neffective action to address this crucial challenge. In June of\r\nthis year, the Assembly of African Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity decided\r\nin their Harare Declaration on African Industrialization to\r\nredouble their efforts to promote sustainable industrial\r\ndevelopment through private-sector-led strategies and new\r\nglobal partnerships. They endorsed the launching of the\r\nAlliance for Africa\u0027s Industrialization, supported by the\r\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\r\n(UNIDO), as the principal mechanism for promoting\r\nprivate-public sector partnerships within Africa as well as\r\npartnerships between African and non-African enterprises.\r\nGiven the prominence of the private sector in Africa\u0027s\r\nindustrialization strategy, it is appropriate that the theme of\r\nthis year\u0027s celebration of Africa Industrialization Day is\r\n“Development of Small and Medium Industries”. The\r\nmajority of industrial enterprises in Africa are small and\r\nmedium-sized, but they account for a large share of jobs\r\ncreated in the economy.\r\nMany are individual or family-owned business\r\noperations with great potential for adjusting rapidly to\r\nchanging market conditions. With trade liberalization and\r\nderegulation, their role has increased in importance. They\r\nare increasingly becoming a dynamic force for the\r\npromotion of sustainable industrial development in Africa.\r\nWhile the United Nations system has done much to\r\nsupport the efforts of African countries to achieve\r\nsustainable development, much more needs to be done.\r\nOrganizations of the United Nations system need to work\r\nmore closely together to encourage the growth of small and\r\nmedium-sized enterprises in African countries. They need\r\nto intensify their efforts to help small African entrepreneurs\r\ngain access to markets, investments, credit, technology and\r\ntraining. In this connection, the contribution that the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization has made over\r\nthe years in facilitating enterprise-level cooperation between\r\nAfrican and non-African business partners and in providing\r\na range of technical support services to small enterprises,\r\nparticularly those of women entrepreneurs, has been\r\ncommendable.\r\nThe development activities of United Nations agencies\r\nin support of industrial development in Africa should be\r\nbetter harmonized. Resources available throughout the\r\nUnited Nations system for this purpose should be pooled to\r\nmaximize the impact of the system\u0027s contributions to\r\nAfrica\u0027s development. An important step in this direction is\r\nthe incorporation of the industrial development objectives\r\nof African countries in the formulation of country strategy\r\nnotes and in the United Nations Development Assistance\r\nFramework.\r\nAs we celebrate Africa Industrialization Day, we\r\nremind ourselves of the importance of taking a common\r\napproach to our common challenges. The development of\r\nAfrica is our common challenge, requiring concerted and\r\ncoordinated action on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. Today\u0027s event provides a good opportunity to\r\nreaffirm our commitment to international cooperation and\r\nour steadfast support to Africa as it strives to fulfil its\r\nhopes and aspirations for a better future.\r\nI call now on the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: We gather on Africa\r\nIndustrialization Day to raise public awareness and\r\nharness international support — political, technical and\r\nfinancial — for Africa\u0027s industrial development. Industrial\r\ndevelopment is a key element of sustainable economic\r\ngrowth. It helps countries achieve important social\r\nobjectives, such as jobs and equity. It creates\r\nopportunities for the integration of women. In rural areas,\r\nlinked with agricultural development, it can help stem\r\nmigration and relieve pressure on cities.\r\nWith industrial development, the continent can take\r\ndecisive steps towards full-throttle competition in the\r\nglobalized marketplace. But without it, as African leaders\r\nthemselves declared last June in Harare, African\r\neconomies will be condemned to persistent crisis,\r\ndependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty,\r\ndespair and political unrest.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAs we mark this eighth Africa Industrialization Day,\r\nhope is the watchword for much of the African continent.\r\nIn 1996, for the first time in 20 years, Africa experienced\r\ngrowth exceeding 4 per cent. More and more countries\r\nare experiencing remarkable economic expansion. The\r\nprivate sector is beginning to play its role in powering the\r\neconomy. Everywhere, civil society is creating the\r\ninstitutions it needs in order to be heard. Decision-makers\r\nare vigorously pursuing their programmes of political,\r\neconomic and social reform. Good governance and its\r\nfoundations — political legitimacy, a State based on the\r\nrule of law, and transparency in administration — are\r\nnow the goals.\r\nNotwithstanding what has been achieved, the results\r\nof African industry remain too meagre. Inadequate\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\ninfrastructure; weak institutions; poorly adapted regulations\r\nand systems for stimulating the financial sphere; and the\r\nwidening technological gap between developed and\r\ndeveloped countries: these are obstacles that slow the\r\nindustrialization of Africa. The continent therefore does not\r\nbenefit as much as it could from the globalization and\r\nliberalization of trade, and it remains difficult for African\r\ncountries to become fully integrated into the world\r\neconomy.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThis year\u0027s Africa Industrialization Day focuses on the\r\ndevelopment of small- and medium-scale industries. Such\r\nenterprises are the backbone of economic activity in Africa.\r\nThey are a major source of livelihoods and income. In both\r\nthe formal and the informal sectors, small entrepreneurs\r\nplay a pivotal role in alleviating poverty and promoting\r\neconomic progress. Increasingly at ease with new\r\ntechnologies and niche marketing, they can respond quickly\r\nto changes and new opportunities.\r\nBut small-scale industries need support from\r\nGovernments and the international community. They require\r\na favourable policy environment. They need to upgrade the\r\nskills of their workers, to improve the quality of their\r\nproducts, to find sources of financing and to gain market\r\naccess. They need technology and the requisite physical\r\ninfrastructure. They need partners: partners from within and\r\nbeyond the region.\r\nIn this light, I welcome recent initiatives by Africa\u0027s\r\ndevelopment partners to promote trade and investment with\r\nAfrican countries. The outcome of last month\u0027s high-level\r\nmeeting on the least-developed countries, sponsored by the\r\nWorld Trade Organization, the United Nations Conference\r\non Trade and Development and the International Trade\r\nCentre, is very encouraging. With 33 out of 48 least-\r\ndeveloped countries, Africa stands to benefit greatly from\r\nthe integrated framework adopted in Geneva, especially the\r\nmarket access facilities that have been announced.\r\nThe Alliance for Africa\u0027s Industrialization, launched\r\nlast year, is another important undertaking, in particular\r\nwith respect to its focus on partnerships with the private\r\nsector.\r\nThe United Nations system — through the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa and other bodies — will continue to\r\nsupport such ventures. UNIDO, as the only specialized\r\nagency dealing with industrial development issues, is\r\nalready promoting technical assistance to small- and\r\nmedium-scale enterprises. As members know, I am\r\ncommitted to a strong UNIDO.\r\nThe work ahead will not be easy. There is donor\r\nfatigue towards Africa, and aid is declining. As we move\r\nforward, Africa\u0027s leaders must rise to the occasion. Their\r\ncommitment — not only to getting the economic\r\nfundamentals right but to creating the broader conditions\r\nthat will encourage investment and development — is of\r\nvital importance. Only then will African industry take off.\r\nOnly then will Africa find the path to sustained\r\nprosperity.\r\nFor my part, I renew my pledge that the\r\nindustrialization of Africa will remain one of the top\r\npriorities of the United Nations, and that I will continue\r\nto be a strong champion of African industrial\r\ndevelopment.\r\nStatement on the occasion of Universal Children\u0027s Day\r\nThe President: I would like to remind members that\r\nin 1954 the United Nations General Assembly, at its ninth\r\nsession, recommended in resolution 836 (IX) that all\r\ncountries institute a Universal Children\u0027s Day, to be\r\nobserved as a day of worldwide fraternity and\r\nunderstanding between children and of activity devoted to\r\npromoting the welfare of the world\u0027s children. The date of\r\n20 November marks the anniversary of the adoption by\r\nthe General Assembly in 1959 of the Declaration on the\r\nRights of the Child and the adoption in 1989 of the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nThe prominent English writer Charles Dickens said,\r\n“In the little world in which children have their\r\nexistence, whosoever brings them up, there is\r\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as\r\ninjustice”. [Great Expectations]\r\nWe should do our utmost to protect the young\r\ngeneration all over the world.\r\nLet us remember the words of another English\r\nwriter, John Ruskin:\r\n“Give a little love to a child, and you get a\r\ngreat deal back”. [The Crown of Wild Olives]\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nI thank the Assembly for its attention, and I remind\r\nthe Assembly that today, besides marking the occasion of\r\nAfrica Industrialization Day, we also celebrate Universal\r\nChildren\u0027s Day.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother appointments\r\n(j) Appointment of a member of the Joint Inspection\r\nUnit\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/52/110)\r\nThe President: In connection with sub-item (j) of\r\nagenda item 17, a note by the Secretary-General has been\r\ncirculated in document A/52/110.\r\nAs indicated in that document, the General Assembly\r\nis required, during the fifty-second session, to appoint a\r\nmember to fill the vacancy in the Joint Inspection Unit that\r\nwill arise from the expiration of the term of office on 31\r\nDecember 1998 of Mr. Raul Quijano of Argentina.\r\nAs also indicated in that document, in accordance with\r\narticle 3, paragraph 1, of the statute of the Joint Inspection\r\nUnit, the President of the General Assembly shall consult\r\nwith Member States to draw up a list of countries — in this\r\ncase, one country — which would be requested to propose\r\na candidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nAfter holding the necessary consultations, I should like\r\nto communicate to the Assembly the following information\r\nreceived from the Chairman of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States: two countries — namely,\r\nArgentina and Colombia — have decided to present their\r\ncandidatures for one vacancy from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States.\r\nI should like, in accordance with past practice, to\r\nconsult with Member States through the procedure of\r\nholding an advisory vote by secret ballot to select from\r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States one\r\ncountry, which would be requested to propose a candidate\r\nfor appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nAlthough this advisory vote would not be an election,\r\nwe would follow the rules of procedure of the Assembly\r\ngoverning elections.\r\nIf there is no objection, may I take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to that procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with existing practice,\r\nthe country receiving the greatest number of votes, and\r\nnot less than a majority of the votes of those present and\r\nvoting, shall be the country selected.\r\nMay I also take it that the General Assembly agrees\r\nto that procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 93 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, when only\r\none person or member is to be elected and no candidate\r\nobtains in the first ballot the majority required, a second\r\nballot shall be taken, which shall be restricted to the two\r\ncandidates obtaining the largest number of votes. If in the\r\nsecond ballot the votes are equally divided, and a majority\r\nis required, the President shall decide between the\r\ncandidates by drawing lots.\r\nI take it that the Assembly also agrees to that\r\nprocedure.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Before I request the Secretariat to\r\ndistribute the ballot papers, I should like to remind\r\nmembers of the Assembly that we are now going to\r\nproceed to the selection of one country from among the\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, which will be\r\nrequested to propose a candidate to fill the vacancy in the\r\nJoint Inspection Unit. The Assembly is not — I repeat,\r\nnot — appointing a member to the Joint Inspection Unit\r\nat this time. It is only selecting one country which will be\r\nrequested to propose a candidate. Therefore, only the\r\nname of a country and not the name of an individual\r\nshould appear on the ballot paper.\r\nI should like to repeat the names of the two\r\ncountries from among the Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates that decided to present their candidatures:\r\nArgentina and Colombia.\r\nThe ballot papers will now be distributed.\r\nMay I request representatives to use only those\r\nballot papers.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nMay I further request members of the Assembly to\r\nwrite on the ballot paper the name of one State from among\r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean States for which they\r\nwish to vote. A ballot paper containing more than one name\r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States will\r\nbe declared invalid. Any ballots with the name of a State\r\noutside the relevant region or with the name of an\r\nindividual shall not be counted at all.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Miss Kalnina\r\n(Latvia), Ms. Han (Singapore) and Mr. Muchanga\r\n(Zambia) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as follows:\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 167\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 3\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 164\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 163\r\nRequired simple majority: 82\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nColombia 86\r\nArgentina 77\r\nThe President: I thank members for their advice and\r\nassistance. I thank the tellers for their assistance.\r\nIn accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the\r\nstatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, Colombia will be\r\nrequested to submit the name of a candidate and a\r\ncurriculum vitae highlighting the candidate\u0027s relevant\r\nqualifications for the task ahead.\r\nAfter holding the appropriate consultations described\r\nin article 3, paragraph 2, of the statute of the Joint\r\nInspection Unit, including consultations with the President\r\nof the Economic and Social Council and with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his capacity as Chairman of the Administrative\r\nCommittee on Coordination, I will propose a qualified\r\ncandidate to the Assembly for appointment to the Joint\r\nInspection Unit.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of sub-item (j) of agenda item 17.\r\nAgenda item 156 (continued)\r\nTowards a culture of peace\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/52/292)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.4/Rev.1)\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Bangladesh to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.4/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Jele (South Africa), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): It is a pleasure and\r\nan honour for Bangladesh to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.4/Rev.1, on behalf of my delegation and all the\r\nsponsors listed in the draft resolution, as well as the new\r\nsponsors of this draft resolution: the Central African\r\nRepublic, Chile, Jamaica, South Africa and Swaziland.\r\nIn this draft resolution, we propose some elements\r\nregarding a culture of peace. The basic thrust of the draft\r\nresolution is to have at the next session a draft declaration\r\nand programme of action on a culture of peace, and we\r\nare requesting the Secretary-General to submit one.\r\nThis draft is the outcome of intensive consultations\r\nwith all interested delegations. In order to accommodate\r\nthe concerns of other delegations, we have made\r\namendments to the original draft contained in A/52/L.4,\r\nand those have been incorporated into this new text.\r\nI will briefly mention those changes, but before that\r\nlet me say that we, the sponsors, very strongly believe\r\nthat the subject of a culture of peace is an important one\r\nthat covers a broad area and deserves our attention at the\r\nhighest level. With that in mind, we requested that this\r\nitem be considered in plenary under a new and separate\r\nagenda item, and we hope that this will continue to be the\r\ncase in coming sessions of the General Assembly as well.\r\nThis subject has attained a level of attention,\r\nimportance and comprehensiveness that it is appropriate\r\nthat it be dealt with by the apex body of the United\r\nNations system, the General Assembly. We believe that\r\nit is the desire of the sponsors, and of all other\r\ndelegations, that this be done similarly in the coming\r\nyears.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nIn this revised text, we have added, in operative\r\nparagraph 2, the full text of a paragraph from last year\u0027s\r\nresolution on a culture of peace. In operative paragraph 3,\r\nsubparagraph (c) has been added, regarding a presentation\r\nof the progress of projects within the framework of the\r\nproject entitled “Towards a culture of peace”.\r\nFinally, in operative paragraph 4, we have requested\r\nthat any comments made on a culture of peace or relevant\r\nissues at the just concluded session of the General\r\nConference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) be included in the\r\nreport submitted next year.\r\nWith these words, we would like to request that the\r\ndraft resolution contained in A/52/L.4/Rev.1 be adopted by\r\nconsensus.\r\nThe Acting President: We shall now proceed to\r\nconsider draft resolution A/52/L.4/Rev.1.\r\nI call on the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Jin Yongjian (Under-Secretary-General for\r\nGeneral Assembly Affairs and Conference Services): I\r\nshould like to inform members that should the General\r\nAssembly adopt draft resolution A/52/L.4/Rev.1, the\r\nSecretary-General does not anticipate that any programme\r\nbudget implications would arise.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now take\r\na decision on draft resolution A/52/L.4/Rev.1, entitled\r\n“Culture of peace”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.4/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.4/Rev.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 52/13).\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to make statements in explanation\r\nof position. May I remind delegations that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Kirsch (Luxembourg) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. Estonia, Poland and Norway also align\r\nthemselves with this explanation of vote.\r\nThe member States of the European Union attach\r\ngreat importance to the concept of a culture of peace. The\r\nEuropean Union participates actively in the\r\ntransdisciplinary project on a culture of peace in the\r\nframework of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO). I would like to\r\nreaffirm here the European Union\u0027s commitment to the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights.\r\nIn recent weeks the member States of the European\r\nUnion have carefully considered the language of the draft\r\nresolution, the revised version of which is before us. In a\r\nconstructive and positive spirit, the European Union\r\nproposed a number of changes to the principal sponsors\r\nof this draft resolution. We thank the sponsors for having\r\nheld informal consultations at our request, but we regret\r\nthat an agreement on our most important proposals did\r\nnot prove possible.\r\nWe would have preferred that the further\r\nconsideration of the elements of the draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action on a culture of peace contained in\r\nthe report of the Director-General of UNESCO, submitted\r\nto the General Assembly in document A/52/292, take\r\nplace within the framework of UNESCO. We will convey\r\nto the Director-General our ideas regarding his draft\r\ndeclaration and programme of action.\r\nThe European Union has nevertheless decided to join\r\nthe consensus on draft resolution A/52/L.4/Rev.1.\r\nMs. Saiga (Japan): The promotion of a culture of\r\npeace is an important task for the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations if our common quest for peaceful\r\ncoexistence is to succeed. It is only in a culture of peace\r\nwhich is rooted in social interaction and sharing, tolerance\r\nand respect for human rights, and a determination to lay\r\nand then maintain the foundation of democracy and\r\nfreedom that it is possible to actualize the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations, and thus save future\r\ngenerations from living in terror and fear of violence. It\r\nis for this reason that my delegation joined in the\r\nconsensus on draft resolution A/52/L.4/Rev.1.\r\nWhen the General Assembly requests a report to be\r\nsubmitted, it expects that that report will genuinely reflect\r\nthe views of the Secretary-General or of the organization\r\nto which the Secretary-General has assigned the task of\r\npreparing it. Much to our disappointment, this is not the\r\ncase with the report of the Director-General of the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) in document A/52/292. That report, which\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\ncontains important elements such as a proposal to establish\r\na special fund, was submitted to the Secretary-General\r\nwithout any prior consultation with the Executive Board of\r\nUNESCO. That failure to follow proper procedure was\r\nbrought to the attention of the members of the Executive\r\nBoard at its meeting last October.\r\nMy delegation would have liked a genuine discussion\r\nto have taken place within UNESCO before the report was\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly so that it could benefit\r\nfrom the views of member States and, consequently, be\r\nreceived as a credible basis for future discussion. As this is\r\nnot the case, my delegation is of the view that it is\r\npremature to proceed, in accordance with this year\u0027s\r\nresolution, to request the Secretary-General to submit a\r\nconsolidated report containing a draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action on a culture of peace.\r\nMy delegation is concerned that the draft declaration\r\nand programme of action will be prepared without any\r\nsubstantive discussion and on the basis of a report that does\r\nnot properly reflect the views of the States members of\r\nUNESCO. Japan therefore expresses strong reservations\r\nwith regard to paragraph 4 of the resolution, and it hopes\r\nthat when the Secretary-General implements this year\u0027s\r\nresolution, in cooperation with the Director-General of\r\nUNESCO, the views of the States members of UNESCO\r\nwill be properly reflected.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 156?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 28\r\nUniversal Congress on the Panama Canal\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/435 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nMr. Boyd (Panama) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe President of the Republic of Panama, Mr. Ernesto\r\nPérez Balladares, invited the entities using the Canal,\r\nprivate-sector shipping concerns and the Governments\r\ninterested in the use of the Canal to contribute ideas\r\nregarding the future of the Panama Canal at a gathering\r\ncalled the Universal Congress on the Panama Canal, which\r\nwas held at Panama City from 7 to 10 September 1997.\r\nPresident Pérez Balladares said\r\n“The purpose of the gathering was to gain a clear\r\nvision of what the waterway would be like following\r\nits transfer to Panama. The Canal users, accordingly,\r\nhad an opportunity at that forum to provide input\r\nand to discuss what kind of waterway would best\r\nserve their interests in the coming decades. There\r\ncan be no doubt that the transfer of the Panama\r\nCanal will stimulate a surge of entrepreneurial\r\nactivity that will create new opportunities with the\r\ndevelopment of industrial zones, the tourist industry\r\nand the opening up of the real estate market along\r\nthe Canal, in what used to be known as the Canal\r\nZone.”\r\nIn 1914 the gates to the Panama Canal were opened\r\nwide to the world. The Canal is 80 kilometres long, from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, and was dug through\r\nthe narrowest and lowest stretch of the mountainous\r\nisthmus that links North and South America. Its principal\r\nfeatures are its two terminal ports, its three sets of twin\r\nlocks, Gatún Lake and the Gaillard Cut, also known as\r\nthe Culebra Cut.\r\nThe locks enable transiting vessels to go up and\r\ncome down again. The Panama Canal is a fresh-water\r\ncanal. In the Gatún Locks, vessels bound for the Pacific\r\nare lifted to the level of Gatún Lake, a height of 85 feet,\r\nwhile Atlantic-bound vessels are lowered to sea level. In\r\nGamboa, the Panama Canal\u0027s route leaves the natural\r\ncourse of the Chagres River and enters the Gaillard Cut.\r\nThe Gaillard Cut is man-made. It was excavated, dredged\r\nand blasted through the mountain range known as the\r\nContinental Cordillera. In its day, the digging of the Cut\r\nwas the largest earth-moving projet ever attempted. Its\r\nextension reached 9 miles at its highest point, more than\r\n320 feet above sea level. There are three levels of\r\ncontiguous locks at Gatún. Ships able to traverse the\r\nPanama Canal locks can be up to 100 feet wide and 950\r\nfeet long. The locks are composed of pairs of imposing\r\ngates from 47 to 82 feet in height.\r\nThe Miraflores Locks mark the Pacific terminus of\r\nthe Panama Canal. The two twin chambers of Miraflores\r\nLake lead to the port of Balboa at sea level. Miraflores\r\nLake, at an altitude of 54 feet, was created by damming\r\nthe waters of the Rio Grande and Rio Cocolí.\r\nAgain, the Canal is a fresh-water canal. Every transit\r\nof any vessel through the Panama Canal creates a loss of\r\n52 million gallons of water, which flow into the oceans.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nFortunately, more than 95 per cent of the merchant vessels\r\nnow in service are in line with the Canal\u0027s parameters.\r\nPanama\u0027s merchant marine ranks first in the world,\r\nand we are now planning a national maritime commission\r\nto bring together under a single body all the elements\r\nrequired by the new measures.\r\nAt this important Congress, the participants included\r\nrepresentatives of chambers of commerce, export-import\r\nassociations, port administrators, shipping agents, banks,\r\ninsurance companies and all kinds of governmental agencies\r\nthat deal with the transport aspects of foreign trade\r\nactivities, as well as academic bodies. There were 65\r\nspeakers, while 345 representatives of the information\r\nmedia from 19 countries, as well as some 571 staff from\r\nthe local media, covered the event.\r\nPanama is very appreciative of the support given by\r\nAmbassador Edgar Camacho Omiste of Bolivia and\r\nAmbassador Pierre Lelong of Haiti to the initial idea of\r\nholding a Universal Congress on the Panama Canal. On 7\r\nNovember 1995 and 24 October 1996, respectively, they\r\nspoke in favour of this idea on behalf of the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean Group. Similarly, here at the\r\nUnited Nations, we wish to acknowledge the support\r\nprovided by Ambassador Victor Marrero of the United\r\nStates, Mr. Jean-Michel Gaussot of France, Ambassador\r\nFernando Enrique Petrella of Argentina and Mr. Emilio\r\nIzquierdo of Ecuador.\r\nBoth the European Union and the Government of\r\nTaiwan made substantial contributions to this meeting,\r\ntaking into account the importance of the Canal for many\r\ncountries, in particular those of South and Central America.\r\nFor the historical record, document A/52/347 contains\r\nthe Declarations of the Eleventh Summit of the Heads of\r\nState or Government of the Rio Group, which was held in\r\nAsunción, Paraguay, on 23 and 24 August 1997. Paragraph\r\n25 of that document states,\r\n“We reaffirm the importance of the Universal\r\nCongress on the Panama Canal, to be held from 7 to\r\n10 September 1997 as a forum open to the entire\r\ninternational community; this meeting should serve as\r\na consultation mechanism for specifically examining\r\nthe role which the Canal should play in the twenty-\r\nfirst century and the plans for expanding its services\r\nwhich the Government of Panama is promoting\r\nthrough the Board of Directors of the Panama Canal\r\nAuthority. We also express our belief that the results\r\nof the Congress will contribute to the growth of\r\nworld trade and to economic growth within the\r\nregion and will promote international cooperation on\r\nthe basis of the principle that the Interoceanic\r\nPanama Canal will be open, on an equal and strictly\r\nneutral basis, to all the world\u0027s users and\r\neconomies.”\r\nAt the Congress, Mr. Rodney Slater, Secretary of\r\nTransportation of the United States said:\r\n“This is a time of great joy for our region. [We\r\nhave] an invaluable opportunity to build a\r\ncommunity of nations. As President Clinton put it,\r\nWe are partners, shoulder to shoulder at this\r\nmoment in history\u0027. The Panama Canal is a global\r\nasset. It is a vital transport artery recognized by all\r\nsailors as the best way in the world to save time.”\r\nMr. Thomas F. McLarty, Adviser to the President of\r\nthe United States and Special Envoy for the Americas,\r\nadded,\r\n“In this changing world, which is also changing the\r\nlives of men and women of the hemisphere, millions\r\nof people are for the first time enjoying\r\nopportunities for growth under democratic\r\nGovernments, with free markets and growing respect\r\nfor human rights and for law. As an open route for\r\ncommerce between the Americas, the Panama Canal\r\nwill expand relations, serving as our crossroads. And\r\nit will continue to be a key to the successful\r\neconomic growth of our peoples.”\r\nIn the course of the meeting, Mr. Jorge E. Ritter,\r\nMinister for Canal Affairs, explained the transfer of\r\njurisdiction over the management of the Canal. The laws\r\nand regulations of the United States that govern the Canal\r\nuntil 31 December 1999 will be replaced by Panamanian\r\nlaws and regulations that have formed part of our\r\ncountry\u0027s Political Constitution since 1994. Those laws\r\nand regulations guarantee the type of agency that will be\r\ntaking over from the United States. It will include an\r\nautonomous administrative and financial commission, and\r\nconditions for Canal workers will not be affected. The\r\nbudget for this agency will be separate from the national\r\nbudget, and the agency will guarantee that traffic in the\r\nCanal will not be interrupted for any reason.\r\nMr. Ritter also explained that the Treaty concerning\r\nthe Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama\r\nCanal envisages that tolls and tariffs for passage will be\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nfair, reasonable, equitable and in line with the principles of\r\ninternational law. This ensures that there will never be\r\nexorbitant increases in tolls by Panama. All this was also\r\nreaffirmed by our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ricardo\r\nAlberto Arias.\r\nThe Secretary-General of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, Mr. César Gaviria, talking about the\r\ntransition and the domestic growth produced by the use of\r\nthe Canal, said that some impressive figures were being\r\nachieved. He announced that trade between Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean had grown by 20 per cent and that trade\r\nbetween Latin America and the United States had grown by\r\n12 per cent. He added that the volume of trade by Latin\r\nAmerica was increasing by 12 per cent per year.\r\nThe Congress bore ample witness to the fact that the\r\nseafaring world recognizes the stability of the Panama\r\nCanal and that international maritime organizations are\r\nconfident they can depend on the security of the Canal.\r\nMr. Alberto Alemán Zubieta, Administrator of the\r\nPanama Canal Commission, stressed the Canal\u0027s neutrality\r\nas one of its fundamental aspects, along with other aspects\r\nsuch as its competitiveness, the need to pursue an\r\nappropriate financial policy and the modernization of the\r\nCanal\u0027s locks using new technology and equipment. As to\r\nthe possibility of building a third set of locks in 2010, the\r\nAdministrator said that\r\n“for a decision of this magnitude we will have to\r\ncarry out an appropriate engineering study”.\r\nIn years past a tripartite commission, made up of\r\nJapan, the United States and Panama, had already\r\nundertaken studies with Panama regarding possible\r\nalternatives for the future of the Canal.\r\nThe gathering held in Panama studied major issues,\r\nsuch as the importance of the Canal; the Canal\u0027s capacity\r\nfor meeting future requirements; alternative approaches to\r\nresolving problems of size and capability; the project for\r\nthe third set of locks; the Canal\u0027s competitiveness;\r\nalternative routes for the Canal; the need to keep the tolls\r\nand service charges as low as possible; the effects of toll\r\nincreases on future Canal usage; privatizing operations as\r\na way of reducing costs and increasing efficiency; operating\r\nthe Canal in accordance with sound business principles;\r\navoiding domestic political interference in order to maintain\r\nthe stability of the staff; toll policies consistent with the aim\r\nof making the Canal a magnet for the development of the\r\nmaritime sector and other branches of the Panamanian\r\neconomy; the need to carry out studies to yield\r\nrecommendations on fair toll levels; other options for the\r\nCanal; conservation of the Canal basin; prospects for the\r\nfuture; the importance of a consultative committee of\r\nusers to act as an advisory board of the Panama Canal\r\nAuthority; changes in the regulations related to\r\nconservation measures and systems; transit costs for\r\ncruise ships; and the need always to consider the rights of\r\nthe users.\r\nThere was consensus among the participants that\r\nPanama does have the human and technical capital to\r\nmanage, operate and efficiently maintain the Canal after\r\nit reverts to the country in 1999. According to official\r\nstatistics, 82 per cent of the 8,500 workers on the\r\nwaterway are Panamanians. Of 324 management\r\npositions, 148 are held by Panamanians in the operational\r\nunits and the naval, engineering and construction front\r\noffices.\r\nThe Congress provided a superb and unique\r\nopportunity for representatives of the merchant marine\r\nindustry and collateral fields to describe to future\r\ninterested parties how the Panama Canal works and thus\r\ngive them a complete understanding of what lies ahead\r\nfor the Canal. The Government of the Republic of\r\nPanama is in earnest in declaring its desire to remain a\r\nkey player in the world maritime industry beyond the year\r\n2000.\r\nIn Panama\u0027s view, the Congress came to a close\r\nhaving attained its chief objective of demonstrating to the\r\ninternational community that the Republic of Panama is\r\nprepared to assume control of the Panama Canal, as\r\nstipulated in the treaties signed between the United States\r\nof America and Panama on 7 September 1977. These\r\nwere coined the Torrijos-Carter treaties by my illustrious\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jorge E. Illueca, and by Mr. Fernando\r\nManfredo, High Commissioner of the Republic of Panama\r\nto the Universal Congress on the Panama Canal, who\r\nworked long and hard to bring the task to a happy\r\nculmination.\r\nPanamanian leaders have always believed that the\r\nPanama Canal is destined to provide an international,\r\nneutral and non-discriminatory public service and that,\r\naccordingly, its uninterrupted and efficient operation is of\r\nspecial interest to such organizations as the United\r\nNations. That is the main reason behind our introduction\r\nof this brief report.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration\r\nof agenda item 28?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 32\r\nZone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/462)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.24/Rev.1)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of South Africa to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.24/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Bergh (South Africa): It is indeed an honour for\r\nSouth Africa to introduce the draft resolution entitled “Zone\r\nof peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic”, contained\r\nin document A/52/L.24, on behalf of States members of the\r\nzone. The draft is the result of intensive consultations held\r\nwith States Members of the United Nations.\r\nThe objectives of the zone include the enhancement of\r\npeace and security; the promotion of regional cooperation\r\nfor social and economic development; the promotion of\r\nenvironmental conservation; and the sustained management\r\nof natural resources, and are being actively pursued by\r\nevery member State.\r\nApart from peace, security and the mutual protection\r\nof the environment, each member State has definitive\r\nfurther benefits to be derived from its association with the\r\nregion. These include the promotion of intraregional\r\ntourism, communication, technology and information\r\nexchange, and of shipping and other transport links.\r\nI wish to cite one positive example in this respect. A\r\nresolution on the zone of peace and cooperation in the\r\nSouth Atlantic — submitted by South Africa as Chair of\r\nthe zone and cosponsored by all zone States with\r\nPermanent Missions in Vienna — was adopted at the\r\nfortieth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs,\r\nwhich was held in March 1997 in Vienna. The resolution\r\ncalls for the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme to examine forms of assistance which could be\r\nextended to the States members of the zone and for the\r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme to report on progress to the\r\nCommission at its forty-second session in 1998. The\r\nresolution was sponsored by Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina,\r\nNigeria, Angola and Namibia and received the\r\nendorsement of the African Group.\r\nOne of the zone\u0027s principle objectives is to promote\r\nand encourage democratic principles, good governance\r\nand the rule of law and to defend all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. The region has made several\r\ncontributions towards peace and security within its\r\nbroader area and it fully realizes that the preservation of\r\npeace and security in the region will forever remain one\r\nof the member States\u0027 most important joint\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nFor example, the members of the zone have been\r\ninvolved, both in a bilateral as well as a multilateral\r\ncontext, in attempts to achieve a positive outcome to the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol. On a regular\r\nbasis, the zone has reaffirmed its willingness to contribute\r\ntowards achieving lasting peace in Angola. Circumstances\r\nin Sierra Leone and Liberia have also demanded the\r\nattention of zone member States, and the situation in each\r\nof them has been under constant scrutiny.\r\nThe zone has readily accepted the challenges posed\r\nby the new global agenda. The region\u0027s constant focus on\r\ndemocracy, good governance, peace, security and nuclear\r\ndisarmament; its undertaking to take responsibility for the\r\nproper and responsible management of the environment;\r\nthe protection of fish and other marine resources; cultural\r\nand technology exchanges; and economic cooperation and\r\nrespect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone\r\nis successfully dealing with a changing global\r\nenvironment.\r\nAnother challenge for the countries of the zone lies\r\nin the multilateral arena. This is to develop more coherent\r\nstrategies to engage issues of mutual importance through\r\na process of dialogue. The zone offers a unique\r\npossibility to create such instruments for dialogue and\r\nexchange of expertise, both on a bilateral and on a\r\nmultilateral level.\r\nThe South African Mission wishes to express its\r\ngratitude to States members of the various regional groups\r\nfor their suggestions in drafting this draft resolution,\r\nwhich in its amended form should once again provide us\r\nwith the necessary consensus text. We therefore urge all\r\nMember States to support the draft resolution, so that it\r\nmay be adopted without a vote.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nMs. Ramírez (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is with satisfaction that I am speaking today on\r\nagenda item 32, entitled “Zone of peace and cooperation of\r\nthe South Atlantic”, to support an initiative which opens up\r\ninteresting prospects for us in the area of international\r\ncooperation.\r\nI would likewise like to express the appreciation of the\r\nGovernment of Argentina to South Africa for its important\r\ncontributions to and quite outstanding coordination of the\r\nwork of the zone during 1996 and 1997.\r\nEleven years have already gone by since the General\r\nAssembly adopted resolution 41/11 in 1986, in which it\r\nsolemnly declared the region of the Atlantic Ocean, in the\r\nregion between Africa and South America, the “Zone of\r\npeace and cooperation of the South Atlantic”. The zone was\r\nborn as an area for promoting understanding and improving\r\ncooperation among the countries of the South Atlantic.\r\nAs stated in the Brasilia and Somerset West\r\nDeclarations, my country attaches particular significance to\r\nfundamental concepts such as democracy and political\r\npluralism and respect for and defence of human rights and\r\nindividual freedoms. We believe that these concepts are\r\nbasic elements which form the basis of the purposes and\r\nprinciples of this initiative.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that we have made\r\nsteady progress towards the objectives which brought about\r\nthe creation of the zone. Its member States have already\r\nheld four high-level meetings, during which they examined\r\nthe various fields open to cooperation during this initial\r\nstage and adopted decisions and declarations with a vision\r\nof the future.\r\nThe member States have set themselves clear\r\nobjectives in fundamental areas: the strengthening of peace\r\nand security; the promotion of regional cooperation in the\r\narea of economic and social development; the protection of\r\nthe marine environment; and the conservation of resources.\r\nWith regard to the first of these objectives, Argentina\r\nbelieves that nuclear-weapon-free zones contribute\r\nsignificantly to international peace and security by\r\ncontinuing to restrict the areas where the use or threat of\r\nuse of such weapons takes place. The countries that belong\r\nto the zone believe in the need for all the zones which have\r\nbeen declared free of nuclear weapons to be consolidated.\r\nLikewise, the Republic of Argentina firmly believes in\r\nthe need to preserve the marine environment, as well as its\r\nliving resources, and is pleased that this view is becoming\r\nincreasingly widespread throughout the international\r\ncommunity in general and in the countries of the South\r\nAtlantic zone in particular.\r\nIn this regard, it is worth mentioning the importance\r\nof the standards adopted in the context of the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization, which seek to\r\npreserve the marine environment from the spills and\r\nwastes associated with shipping, and the 1995 Agreement\r\non the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\r\nAnother issue which my delegation wishes to draw\r\nto the General Assembly\u0027s attention has to do with the\r\ntransport of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-\r\nlevel radioactive wastes. In this regard, I would like to\r\nplace on record the concern felt by the Republic of\r\nArgentina — which is surely shared by the other\r\ncountries of the zone — at the risks inherent in the\r\npassage of ships carrying radioactive wastes through the\r\nSouth Atlantic.\r\nLikewise, we favour the adoption in the waters\r\nsubject to our jurisdiction of measures recognized by\r\ninternational law aimed at safeguarding the health of our\r\npopulations and marine systems. We believe in the need\r\nto strengthen international regulation in this area.\r\nWith regard to the fight against drug trafficking and\r\nthe crimes associated with it, we reiterate our constant\r\nreadiness to cooperate in achieving the goals of the South\r\nAtlantic zone, in line with the Somerset West Declaration.\r\nAs hosts of the fifth high-level meeting, to be held next\r\nyear, we trust that we will be able to make progress in\r\nthe consideration of some of the issues related to\r\ncooperation on drugs that will have concrete effects in the\r\ncontext of the zone.\r\nI would like once again to reaffirm that the Republic\r\nof Argentina shares in the call made annually to all States\r\nby the members of the zone of peace and cooperation of\r\nthe South Atlantic to cooperate in promoting its objectives\r\nand to refrain from any action inconsistent with those\r\nobjectives, particularly action which may create or\r\naggravate situations of tension and potential conflict in\r\nthe region. The Republic of Argentina extends that call so\r\nthat — in accordance with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Organization — all States not only\r\nprevent conflicts but also commit themselves to the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\npeaceful quest, through negotiation, for the lasting and just\r\nsettlement of disputes pending in the region.\r\nThe zone of peace and cooperation of the South\r\nAtlantic is an arena where its members have found the\r\nopportunity to express their solidarity and determination to\r\ncooperate on the basis of essential universal principles, such\r\nas the promotion of democracy and political pluralism and\r\nthe advancement of human rights and fundamental liberties,\r\nin the conviction that this will bring us closer to the ideals\r\nwhich bind the international community. In this setting, we\r\nlikewise trust that economic and commercial ties across our\r\ncommon ocean will be significantly expanded in these\r\nfavourable circumstances.\r\nFinally, I would like to reiterate our satisfaction and\r\ncommitment as we prepare to serve as host to the fifth\r\nhigh-level meeting of the zone of peace and cooperation of\r\nthe South Atlantic in 1998, an event which we hope will\r\nlead to the advancement of the principles and objectives\r\nwhich prompted us to establish the zone.\r\nMr. Amehou (Benin) (interpretation from French): In\r\nestablishing the zone of peace and cooperation of the South\r\nAtlantic by resolution 41/11 of 27 October 1986, the\r\nGeneral Assembly had among its objectives the promotion\r\nof peace and security in the zone and the strengthening of\r\ndevelopment cooperation between the countries of Africa\r\nand South America.\r\nThe member countries of the zone have worked\r\ntowards the progressive achievement of these objectives for\r\nmore than 10 years through their successive meetings in\r\nRio de Janeiro (Brazil) in 1986, in Abuja (Nigeria) in 1990,\r\nin Brasilia (Brazil) in 1994 and in Somerset West (South\r\nAfrica) last year. The course thus charted demonstrates the\r\ndetermination of the countries of the zone to make it a\r\ngenuine instrument for the promotion of peace and a\r\ndynamic institution of South-South cooperation.\r\nBenin therefore welcomes the progress achieved,\r\nespecially the objectives attained since the holding of the\r\nfourth meeting of member States of the zone in Somerset\r\nWest in April 1996.\r\nIn this connection, the positive developments in the\r\nsituation in Liberia are a source of satisfaction for the\r\ndelegation of Benin. Indeed, thanks to the determined action\r\nundertaken by the countries of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) with the support of the\r\ninternational community, the very long and devastating war\r\nin Liberia — a country which is a member of the zone —\r\ncame to an end with the holding of presidential and\r\nlegislative elections on 19 July 1997.\r\nOur hope is that, with the support of the countries of\r\nthe zone and the United Nations, the current efforts to\r\nrestore peace — particularly in Sierra Leone — will\r\nsucceed as soon as possible.\r\nIn this connection, Benin commends the full support\r\nthat the Security Council has given to ECOWAS to\r\nresolve the crisis in Sierra Leone and restore the\r\ndemocratically elected Government. The Government of\r\nBenin invites all parties concerned to work towards the\r\neffective and speedy implementation of the peace plan\r\nagreed to at Conakry on 23 October 1997.\r\nThe maintenance of peace and stability in the South\r\nAtlantic calls for the promotion of disarmament and the\r\nstrengthening of the non-proliferation regime for small\r\narms and weapons of mass destruction throughout the\r\nzone. To this end, the denuclearization of the South\r\nAtlantic must remain a priority objective for the countries\r\nof the zone. In that connection, we must work together to\r\nstrengthen measures for a complete ban on nuclear\r\nweapons in the South Atlantic through the implementation\r\nof the Treaty of Tlatelolco for the Prohibition of Nuclear\r\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean and of the\r\nTreaty of Pelindaba, which has made Africa a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone.\r\nToday, on the threshold of the third millennium and\r\nfaced with the numerous challenges arising out of the\r\nphenomenon of globalization at the national and\r\ninternational levels, Benin considers that the time has\r\ncome for the countries of the zone to strengthen their\r\nefforts so as to reap greater benefit from the many\r\neconomic and commercial opportunities offered by the\r\nzone. We must also strengthen our cooperation in\r\nenvironmental protection and in activities aimed at\r\ncombating drug trafficking throughout the region.\r\nThe fifth meeting of States members of the zone, to\r\nbe held in 1998 and which Argentina has offered to host,\r\nmust be the forum for determining ways and means of\r\nachieving those objectives. My country will spare no\r\neffort in contributing to the implementation of such\r\ninitiatives.\r\nMr. Ayewah (Nigeria): In contributing to the debate\r\non the zone of peace and cooperation of the South\r\nAtlantic, the Nigerian delegation wishes to express its\r\nappreciation to States Members of the United Nations and\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nto the international community at large for their continued\r\nsupport of the zone as a forum designed to further\r\ncooperation among countries of the South in their pursuit of\r\npeace and development.\r\nIn confronting the issues of peace and security,\r\nmember States of the zone have equally brought to the fore\r\nproblems associated with crisis management and conflict\r\nresolution. It is in this connection that one must advert to\r\nthe difficult situations in a number of countries members of\r\nthe zone. Some of these difficult situations have found\r\nsolutions, while others have proved intractable. Liberia is an\r\nexample of those crisis situations that have found a solution\r\n— albeit after a protracted effort. Today, Liberia can be\r\ndescribed as a success story. But on the other side of the\r\ncoin is the continuing crisis in Angola. Regrettably, Sierra\r\nLeone and the Congo have joined the list of intractable\r\ncircumstances that need the collaborative efforts of the\r\ninternational community in order to find durable solutions\r\nto the problems besetting the two countries.\r\nThe member States of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) took the bull by the horns\r\nand, with the support of the international community,\r\nsucceeded in solving the Liberian problem. We look\r\nforward to similar cooperation in relation to the solution of\r\nthe problem in Sierra Leone in order to reinstate President\r\nKabbah and restore constitutional order to that country. In\r\nthis regard we commend the initiative of ECOWAS and the\r\naction of the Security Council for the embargo which the\r\nlatter imposed in its resolution 1132 (1997) of 8 October\r\n1997 on the sale and supply of petroleum and petroleum\r\nproducts, and arms and related matériel of all types, to\r\nSierra Leone, along with other measures. We also look\r\nforward to a hitch-free implementation of the peace plan\r\nagreed in Conakry on 23 October between the ECOWAS\r\nCommittee of Five on Sierra Leone and representatives of\r\nthe junta. We are, of course, glad that the peace plan has\r\nbeen accepted by President Kabbah himself.\r\nIt is appropriate at this point to reiterate the need for\r\nthe provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance in\r\nresponse to local needs in that particular country. It is\r\nequally important that all States and relevant international\r\norganizations continue to assist those countries that have to\r\ngrapple with the influx of refugees and displaced persons as\r\na result of the crisis in Sierra Leone.\r\nAlong with other members of the international\r\ncommunity, Nigeria welcomes the return of stability to the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which has great\r\nimplications for broader subregional peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. We regret, however, that the Security\r\nCouncil has not been more forthcoming with regard to the\r\nsituation in the neighbouring Republic of the Congo. The\r\ncrisis in that country has resulted in the displacement of\r\nover two thirds of the residents of Brazzaville and in the\r\nextensive destruction of the city\u0027s infrastructure. The crisis\r\nhas been further complicated by the involvement of\r\nexternal forces. We can only plead that all concerned\r\npursue the logic of peace. In this regard, we commend the\r\nmediatory role of Gabon and other countries in the region\r\nfor their efforts in favour of peace in the subregion.\r\nOne of the expressed desires of the members of the\r\nzone is for the South Atlantic to be free of nuclear\r\nweapons. The conclusion of the Treaty of Pelindaba,\r\ntaken with the authority of the already established Treaty\r\nof Tlatelolco, will, when they both come into full\r\noperation, move us towards the realization of that goal.\r\nThese two nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties, together\r\nwith the treaties of Raratonga and Bangkok and the\r\nAntarctic Treaty, are turning almost half of the globe into\r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone. This is a welcome\r\ndevelopment. In order to maintain that state of play, we\r\ncall upon the nuclear-weapon States in particular to\r\nrespect that status as well as the desire of the inhabitants\r\nof the southern hemisphere to keep the threat of nuclear\r\nweapons out of their horizon, out of their territories and\r\nout of their future.\r\nArgentina has offered to host the fifth meeting of the\r\nzone in Buenos Aires in 1998. We are heartened by this\r\noffer, as it will afford us the opportunity to follow up on\r\nthe different projects either envisaged or decided upon at\r\nthe fourth high-level meeting of the zone in Somerset\r\nWest, South Africa. These include cooperation in the fight\r\nagainst drug trafficking and protection of the marine\r\nenvironment for the conservation of marine resources.\r\nAnother area of cooperation on which progress has\r\nbeen made in recent times — aside from trade and the\r\nsharing of industrial expertise and experience — is the\r\neffort to prohibit the dumping of radioactive and\r\nhazardous wastes. We welcome the adoption of the Joint\r\nConvention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and\r\non the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.\r\nTogether with other prohibition agreements that have been\r\nsigned and the annual consensus resolutions that have\r\nbeen recommended by various General Assembly\r\ncommittees and adopted by the Assembly on the\r\nprohibition of the dumping of radioactive wastes and on\r\nthe transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, this\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\ndevelopment has helped to establish accepted international\r\nnorms on the subject.\r\nAs we look forward to the next high-level meeting of\r\nthe zone, to be held in Buenos Aires in 1998, we wish to\r\nexpress appreciation to the Government of South Africa for\r\nhosting the fourth meeting of the members of the zone. We\r\nwould also like to thank the South African delegation, as\r\nwell as other members of the bureau of the Permanent\r\nCommittee of the zone in New York, for their coordination\r\nefforts, including the preparation of this year\u0027s draft\r\nresolution, which is contained in document\r\nA/52/L.24/Rev.1.\r\nIn concluding, we wish to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report contained in document A/52/462. We also\r\nthank the United Nations agencies which have taken action\r\nin fulfilment of the various mandates given to them in\r\nresolution 51/19 of 1996.\r\nMr. Felicio (Brazil): The zone of peace and\r\ncooperation of the South Atlantic is of great importance to\r\nBrazil. Our country had the honour to host two of the\r\nministerial meetings of the members of the zone, the first\r\nin Rio de Janeiro in 1986, and the second in Brasilia in\r\n1994. Brazil was present at the meeting in Abuja, Nigeria,\r\nin 1990, and took part in the fourth ministerial meeting,\r\nheld in Somerset West, South Africa, in 1996. We look\r\nforward to the meeting to be held in Argentina next year.\r\nThe countries of Africa and South America on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic Ocean have taken the initiative to build\r\na bridge of understanding across that vast expanse of sea\r\nbetween our shores. The aim is to foster mutual knowledge,\r\nincrease cooperation, give new life to old ties, search for\r\nsolutions to common problems, learn from each other\u0027s\r\nexperiences and, where possible, act together in shaping a\r\ncommon future.\r\nThe near completion of the process of decolonization\r\nmade it possible for the South Atlantic countries to\r\nestablish closer political and economic relations and to\r\nfurther the endeavour of working towards more effective\r\nways to build peace and prosperity. The zone of peace and\r\ncooperation of the South Atlantic is an attempt in that\r\ndirection that is gradually becoming an invaluable\r\ninstrument to both African and South American countries.\r\nThe initiatives undertaken in the areas of protection of\r\nthe marine environment, trade and economic\r\ncompetitiveness, cooperation against drug trafficking and\r\nprohibition of nuclear weapons point to priority areas where\r\nthe States members of the zone wish to undertake join\r\naction, and where they expect the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAll members of the zone are parties to nuclear-\r\nweapon-free-zone treaties — the Treaty for the\r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco) and the Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone Treaty for Africa (Treaty of\r\nPelindaba) — and are seeking to strengthen the links of\r\ncooperation with the other nuclear-weapon-free zones of\r\nthe southern hemisphere and adjacent areas, established\r\nby the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of\r\nRaratonga) and the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free\r\nZone Treaty (Treaty of Bangkok).\r\nWith the aim of assuring protection of the marine\r\nenvironment, especially the conservation of marine living\r\nresources and the prevention and containment of\r\nenvironmental accidents, the countries of the zone have\r\nstarted to exchange relevant information. This exercise\r\nshould continue. In this context, the navies of some\r\nmember States of the zone have been developing efforts\r\nto improve their capacity to work together.\r\nBrazil has also sought to improve ways and means\r\nof cooperating with other members of the zone in the\r\ncombat against the traffic in illicit drugs, a growing\r\nproblem on the two sides of the Atlantic, and member\r\ncountries have started to coordinate their activities in\r\nmultilateral forums.\r\nAnother important area for the member countries of\r\nthe zone is the promotion of democracy, political\r\npluralism and national reconciliation. The draft resolution\r\nintroduced today makes reference to developments in\r\nLiberia, Sierra Leone and Angola since last year and calls\r\nfor increased humanitarian assistance for Liberia and\r\nAngola.\r\nThe Brazilian Government, within the limits of its\r\nresources, is committed to continued cooperation with\r\nother South Atlantic countries in all the areas I have\r\nmentioned. For the member countries of the zone, the\r\napproval of this draft resolution by the General Assembly\r\nis an invaluable expression of the international\r\ncommunity\u0027s support for peace and security, for\r\ncooperation and for economic and social development in\r\na democratic environment, as expressed in the Final\r\nDeclaration of the fourth meeting of the States members\r\nof the zone.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nThe African and South American countries members\r\nof the zone of peace and cooperation aim at erecting\r\nbuilding blocks of cooperation, understanding, stability and\r\nprosperity. The Southern Cone Common Market, the\r\nSouthern African Development Community and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States are\r\norganizations that overlap with the zone and reinforce it.\r\nWe are confident that, like similar texts in previous years,\r\ndraft resolution A/52/L.24/Rev.1, which was introduced by\r\nthe representative of South Africa on behalf of the States\r\nmembers of the zone, will receive general support.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. The General Assembly\r\nwill now take a decision on draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.24/Rev.1.\r\nI should like to announce that, since the introduction\r\nof draft resolution A/52/L.24/Rev.1, Guinea-Bissau and\r\nSenegal have become sponsors of the draft resolution.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria,\r\nAzerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belarus,\r\nBelgium, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil,\r\nBrunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi,\r\nCameroon, Canada, Cape Verde, Chad, Chile, China,\r\nColombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Côte d\u0027Ivoire, Cuba,\r\nCyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominican Republic,\r\nEcuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea,\r\nEritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France,\r\nGabon, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada,\r\nGuatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland,\r\nIndia, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Ireland,\r\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya,\r\nKuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People\u0027s Democratic\r\nRepublic, Latvia, Lesotho, Liberia, Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali,\r\nMalta, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco,\r\nMongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar,\r\nNamibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand,\r\nNicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan,\r\nPanama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru,\r\nPhilippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of\r\nKorea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian\r\nFederation, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia,\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San\r\nMarino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone,\r\nSingapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands,\r\nSouth Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname,\r\nSwaziland, Sweden, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Trinidad\r\nand Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine,\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of\r\nTanzania, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen,\r\nZambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nNone\r\nAbstaining:\r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted by 157 votes to\r\nnone, with 1 abstention (resolution 52/14).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of Andorra, Guinea-\r\nBissau, Hungary and Uruguay informed the\r\nSecretariat that they had intended to vote in favour.]\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to explain their votes. May I\r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are limited\r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Richier (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nFrance, with its partners in the European Union, voted in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution. It gives its full support in\r\nparticular to the paragraphs relating to Angola, Sierra\r\nLeone and Liberia.\r\nIn this context, France wishes, nevertheless, to recall\r\nits traditional reservations as to the concept of zones of\r\npeace in general. I would particularly cite the\r\ngeographical limits of such zones, the nature of the\r\nobligations upon States and respect for international law,\r\nparticularly the law of the sea.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 32?\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 12\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council\r\nDraft resolutions (A/52/L.15, L.18, L.21, L.22)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nCôte d\u0027Ivoire to introduce draft resolution A/52/L.15.\r\nMr. Bamba (Côte d\u0027Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.15, entitled “Proclamation of the year 2000 as the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace”, on behalf of\r\nthe following sponsors: Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nArgentina, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Brazil, Burundi,\r\nCameroon, Cape Verde, the Central African Republic,\r\nChad, Chile, the Comoros, Costa Rica, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, El\r\nSalvador, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Ghana,\r\nGuatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Mali, Morocco,\r\nMozambique, Namibia, the Niger, Panama, Peru, Senegal,\r\nSierra Leone, the Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, Tunisia, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Côte\r\nd\u0027Ivoire. I must add that a number of other sponsors are to\r\nbe included in the list, but for technical reasons their names\r\ndo not appear in document A/52/L.15. The additional\r\nsponsors are Bhutan, the Dominican Republic, Georgia,\r\nGuyana, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nicaragua and\r\nTurkmenistan.\r\nThe Assembly will recall that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, on a proposal of Côte d\u0027Ivoire with which some 30\r\nother States associated themselves, adopted at its\r\nsubstantive session held in July 1997 in Geneva resolution\r\n1997/47 recommending that the General Assembly, at its\r\nfifty-second session, proclaim the year 2000 the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace. Now, to follow\r\nup on that recommendation of the Council, the Assembly\r\nhas before it this morning draft resolution A/52/L.15.\r\nAmong the key ideas that led to the creation of the\r\nUnited Nations, one must quite rightly give pride of place\r\nto the idea of a culture of peace, as contained in the\r\npreamble to the Charter, reflecting the determination of the\r\npeoples of the world, having emerged from two world\r\nconflicts\r\n“to practice tolerance and live together in peace with\r\none another as good neighbours”.\r\nWe can thus see the concept of the culture of peace\r\nthus finds its source in the values and aspirations\r\nunderpinning the foundation of the universal Organization\r\nthat was created — and we can never repeat it often\r\nenough —\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold\r\nsorrow to mankind”.\r\nBy and large, the idea of the culture of peace rests\r\nessentially on the repudiation of violence. It invokes all\r\nthe values, attitudes and behaviours reflecting and\r\nfurthering tolerance and solidarity. Its foundations are the\r\nprinciples of liberty, justice and democracy. The idea of\r\nthe culture of peace seeks, lastly, to prevent conflicts at\r\ntheir source and to resolve problems through dialogue and\r\nnegotiation.\r\nThe logic of mistrust and confrontation that\r\ncharacterized the cold war period frustrated the full\r\nexpression of the culture of peace. Paradoxically,\r\nhowever, the end of the cold war, although bringing with\r\nit a multitude of beneficial changes — notably, in\r\nrelations among countries — has not after all prevented\r\nthe proliferation of explosions of violence, such as we\r\nhave witnessed in numerous inter-ethnic conflicts in\r\nrecent years.\r\nThe reality of this end of the century is all too full\r\nof scenes of armed conflict, civil war, genocide and\r\nwandering masses of refugees and displaced persons\r\nfleeing massacres. All this calls out to conscience and\r\nplaces the international community face to face with its\r\nresponsibility in this arena.\r\nWith respect to this situation, we should in all\r\nhonesty recognize the proven capability of the United\r\nNations to manage crisis situations, as shown by its many\r\nsuccesses in many different peacekeeping operations.\r\nDecisive United Nations action in these situations\r\nhas contributed to saving many human lives, which gives\r\nus enormous satisfaction, and we hope that everything\r\npossible will be done to enhance the United Nations\r\ncapability in the fields of peacekeeping, preventive action\r\nand emergency humanitarian assistance.\r\nNevertheless, we note that the specific timing of\r\npeacekeeping operations, inasmuch as they are always\r\nrapid responses to emergencies, restricts their long-term\r\nscope. As a result, they must necessarily be\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\ncomplemented by in-depth activities, especially educational\r\nactivities, aimed at inculcating a culture of peace in the\r\nsocieties in question. Substantive work is therefore required\r\nso that the structures and institutional manifestations of war,\r\nand their deeper roots — namely, the culture of violence\r\nand war — can be transformed into a culture of peace.\r\nThe following extract from the preamble to the\r\nConstitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO), reflects precisely\r\nthis same concern in affirming that\r\n“since wars began in the minds of men, it is in the\r\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be\r\nconstructed”.\r\nThe transition from a culture of war to a culture of\r\npeace seems to us, therefore, to be the essential backdrop\r\nto all United Nations activities in dealing with the\r\nnumerous challenges emerging on the horizon of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nIt is fitting here to pay a resounding tribute to\r\nUNESCO, which, under the dynamic leadership of its\r\nDirector-General has set, as a priority goal for its work,\r\nraising awareness to promote the transition from a culture\r\nof war to a culture of peace. But in the final analysis, it is\r\nup to all of us, large and small nations alike, each at its\r\nown level and pace, to work jointly to accomplish this lofty\r\nundertaking that can only foster tolerance, solidarity and\r\nharmony between peoples and between nations.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Côte d\u0027Ivoire initiated draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.15, recommending to the General\r\nAssembly the proclamation of the year 2000 as the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace. We consider\r\nthe choice of the year 2000 to be of fundamental\r\nimportance in launching the promotion of the culture of\r\npeace at a global level.\r\nThe aim is to harness the symbolism inherent in the\r\nyear 2000, as it is an emblem of, inter alia, ideas of\r\nrenewal and hope for a more peaceful world. The year 2000\r\nmust help us reinvent peace. The beginning of the\r\nmillennium should therefore be marked by a mobilization\r\nof national and international public opinion, directed\r\nparticularly towards young people, inviting them to make\r\na difference and encouraging them to break once and for all\r\nwith the behaviour patterns and attitudes of the recent and\r\nthe more distant past, characterized by crises, wars and\r\nviolence.\r\nWe remain convinced that launching an International\r\nYear for the Culture of Peace at the turn of the\r\nmillennium can only help stimulate efforts by individuals,\r\nas well as by the international community, aimed at\r\ncreating and promoting a culture of peace in people\u0027s\r\nminds, beginning with the next century.\r\nThe proclamation of an International Year for the\r\nCulture of Peace is intended as a force for raising public\r\nawareness, at the dawn of the new millennium, of the\r\nneed for a culture of peace in the daily life of societies,\r\nwith particular attention to young people.\r\nThe programme for and the financing of activities\r\nmarking the celebration of the International Year for the\r\nCulture of Peace are in keeping with the guidelines\r\nadopted by the General Assembly. Indeed, UNESCO\r\nintends to take the necessary steps to coordinate a\r\nprogramme of activities that will be financed entirely by\r\nvoluntary contributions.\r\nIn taking the initiative of introducing draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.15, Côte d\u0027Ivoire retains the image that the entire\r\nworld has of it, as a country of peace, tolerance, solidarity\r\nand shared happiness. The history of our young nation,\r\nfashioned by the enlightened vision of the father of\r\nmodern Côte d\u0027Ivoire, the late President Houphouet-\r\nBoigny, has been a happy succession of victories for\r\npeace that have inevitably given rise to prosperity. Since\r\n1989 Côte d\u0027Ivoire has marked 15 November as a day for\r\nthe celebration of peace.\r\nThis pact with peace and progress is continuing\r\nharmoniously under President Henri Konan Bédié, who is\r\nfurthermore sparing no effort in advancing democracy and\r\na state of law through the constant practice of dialogue\r\nand consultation. The faithful commitment of\r\nCôte d\u0027Ivoire to the culture of peace was brilliantly\r\nreaffirmed recently by President Henri Konan Bédié in a\r\nspeech given on 23 March in Bamako, Mali, on the\r\noccasion of the Week of Peace, when he declared:\r\n“For the Ivoirian, peace is a second religion. It is the\r\nmost precious good that President Houphouet-\r\nBoigny bequeathed to us. In Côte d\u0027Ivoire we think\r\nof peace as something patiently constructed out of\r\nlove for others, tolerance, justice and a common\r\nstriving for development, all of which are propelled\r\nby constant dialogue and the quest for compromise.\r\nOur philosophy and our political practice, our\r\nactions and our energies, are all centred on the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\ncontinuous and persistent search for peace through\r\ndialogue.”\r\nIn 1989 the international dimension of peace was\r\nenshrined in Côte d\u0027Ivoire with UNESCO\u0027s creation of the\r\ninternational Houphouet-Boigny Prize, awarded each year\r\nto\r\n“honour people, institutions or organizations that have\r\nsignificantly contributed to promoting, seeking,\r\nsafeguarding or maintaining peace.”\r\nThis prize was awarded for the first time in 1991, to\r\nPresidents Nelson Mandela and Frederik de Klerk. They\r\nwere followed in 1992 by The Hague Academy of\r\nInternational Law. The late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Shimon Peres\r\nwere honoured in 1993, King Juan Carlos of Spain and\r\nPresident Jimmy Carter of the United States in 1994, and\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees in 1995. Most recently, in 1997, it was awarded\r\nto President Alvaro Arzú Irigoyen of Guatemala and\r\nCommander Rolando Morán, head of the Unidad\r\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), both of\r\nwhom deserve credit for agreeing to put an end to 36 years\r\nof civil war in Guatemala.\r\nWe are delighted to note, as the report of the\r\nSecretary-General in document A/52/292 points out, that the\r\nculture of peace is being implemented by many other\r\ncountries throughout the world. I need mention only a few\r\nof the many examples.\r\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, ministerial-level\r\nmeetings, seminars and training sessions have been\r\norganized by UNESCO on issues relating to human rights,\r\ndemocracy, peace and development. The culture of peace\r\nhas already been introduced in university curriculums in the\r\nCaribbean. A mayors\u0027 prize for peace was awarded for the\r\nfirst time in the Caribbean and Latin America at the\r\ninternational congress on cities and education for the culture\r\nof peace, which was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in\r\nSeptember 1996. The prize was awarded to Mrs. Gloria\r\nCuertas Montoya, mayor of the city of Apartadó, Colombia.\r\nActivities designed to promote the culture of peace are\r\nbeing undertaken by countries throughout Asia and the\r\nPacific with the assistance of UNESCO, furthering\r\ntolerance, dialogue among cultures and cultural diversity.\r\nIn Africa, programmes targeting the culture of peace\r\nhave been implemented for the demobilized military forces\r\nin Mozambique, Rwanda and other countries that have\r\nreturned to peace after years of war. The teaching of this\r\nsubject at schools and universities is also taking place in\r\nZimbabwe, Namibia and Mozambique.\r\nWith regard to Mozambique, a country that has\r\nknown the torments of civil war, it is particularly\r\ninteresting to note the importance that that country\r\nattaches to the culture of peace, as is evident from the\r\nfollowing extract from the statement of the President of\r\nMozambique, Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session on 22\r\nOctober:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“We believe that the promotion and further\r\nconsolidation of a culture of peace should be the\r\nnext most important challenge to all societies as well\r\nas to each individual citizen.” [Official Records of\r\nthe General Assembly, Fifty-second session, Plenary\r\nMeetings, 35th meeting, p. 2]\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nPeace, democracy and development are, today more\r\nthan ever, crucial and indispensable elements for human\r\ndevelopment within a society committed to progress.\r\nPeace, democracy and development form an interactive\r\ntriangle that gains its vitality from the culture of peace.\r\nBut peace remains a constant quest, a long-term\r\nendeavour that requires daily effort. We thus prepare for\r\npeace through a long process that takes into account all\r\ngenerations in society: by training children so that they\r\ncan internalize and accept the values of peace; by re-\r\neducating adults so that they learn anew to accept racial\r\ndifferences, respect cultural diversity and live with\r\ntolerance; and by inviting the elderly to reach out in\r\nforgiveness and reconciliation, especially when the\r\nmemory of the past is still alive.\r\nWe are on the eve of a new millennium.\r\nGlobalization and the worldwide spread of all we do are\r\naccelerating thanks to the extraordinary progress of\r\nscience and technology and their dissemination.\r\nThe world is changing and we must adopt new\r\nbehaviour patterns. We must resolutely turn our backs on\r\nthe ordeals, horrors and errors of the past. We need to\r\nlook to the future with confidence and to see to it that the\r\ntwenty-first century is one of non-violence, peace,\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\ndemocracy, progress for all and shared happiness. That is\r\nwhy we must now move to give the culture of peace a\r\nchance.\r\nI therefore hope that the General Assembly will adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/52/L.15, entitled “Proclamation of the\r\nyear 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of\r\nPeace”, without a vote.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nArgentina to introduce draft resolution A/52/L.18.\r\nMs. Ramírez (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.18, entitled “Year 2000: International Year of\r\nThanksgiving”, which is sponsored by Bangladesh, Brazil,\r\nCape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d\u0027Ivoire,\r\nEcuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras,\r\nKyrgyzstan, the Marshall Islands, Nicaragua, Paraguay, the\r\nPhilippines, Swaziland, Trinidad and Tobago, the United\r\nStates of America, Uruguay and Venezuela as well as my\r\nown country, Argentina.\r\nThe sponsors of this initiative consider that it makes\r\na contribution of the most far-reaching importance in order\r\nto give real meaning and depth to the concept of gratitude,\r\nand to lead us to reflect on how to develop and stimulate\r\nall those actions that contribute to understanding and\r\nnational reconciliation.\r\nThe Republic of Argentina welcomes this initiative\r\nwith particular interest as it shares in the concern about the\r\nsituation that mankind is experiencing today, particularly\r\nthe most disadvantaged and vulnerable. This situation has\r\nprompted our country to work actively in the international\r\narena in areas afflicted by natural disasters, regional\r\nconflicts or other emergencies.\r\nWe live in times of profound global change that\r\ninvolve the entire world and that give rise to uncertainty\r\nand unease as to the future. In this context, it is a challenge\r\nfor us to give new substance to our commitment and\r\nsolidarity, leaving behind isolationist and individualist views\r\nof international relations or a memory of the past.\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, for there to be consensus as\r\nto the need to build international action in the field of\r\ncooperation and humanitarian assistance, on the basis of a\r\njoint effort by the international community.\r\nIn this sense, to proclaim the year 2000 as\r\nInternational Year of Thanksgiving — beyond the objective\r\nof highlighting once again the community of universal\r\nvalues that link the different peoples of the world — has\r\na more profound meaning, insofar as the message of\r\nthanksgiving tends to alleviate the suffering and poverty\r\nresulting from natural disasters and warlike conflict\r\nthrough the search for equity and justice.\r\nLikewise, we believe that this initiative will give\r\nfuture generations an opportunity to join in projects that\r\nstrengthen international cooperation and share in cultural\r\ncelebrations generating peace and reconciliation.\r\nMore than 50 years after the convening of the San\r\nFrancisco Conference, we still have the same trust and\r\nhope in the work of the United Nations. We are\r\nconvinced, moreover, that the process of reform the\r\nOrganization is now undergoing, under the firm and well-\r\nreasoned stimulus of the Secretary-General, will lead to\r\nactions that will contribute to the development and\r\nprogress of humanity.\r\nIn this context, the declaration of the year 2000 as\r\nInternational Year of Thanksgiving will provide a unique\r\nopportunity for us to come together again in the spirit\r\nwhich spurred the Organization\u0027s founders. It is this spirit\r\nthat should guide our actions in order to realize the high\r\nideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFor all these reasons, we hope that draft resolution\r\nA/52//18 will be adopted.\r\nThe Acting Chairman: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Japan to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.22.\r\nMr. Owada (Japan): It is my great honour to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.22 entitled “International\r\nYear of Volunteers, 2001”.\r\nThe idea of an International Year of Volunteers\r\noriginated in a policy forum, held jointly by the United\r\nNations Volunteer Programme and the United Nations\r\nUniversity in Japan in 1996, where I had the honour of\r\nbeing a keynote speaker. This initiative was subsequently\r\nendorsed by the 40 volunteer organizations attending the\r\nConference on International Volunteerism held in\r\nWashington, D.C., in May 1996. At the substantive\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council held in July\r\nthis year, a draft resolution recommending that the\r\nGeneral Assembly proclaim the year 2001 the\r\nInternational Year of Volunteers was submitted by 60\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nsponsoring countries, and was adopted as resolution\r\n1997/44 at that session.\r\nVolunteer service — the contributions that individuals\r\nmake as non-profit and non-career activities to enhance the\r\nwell-being of the less fortunate — has been a part of every\r\ncivilization and society. Today, volunteers are active in a\r\nwide range of areas, including welfare, environment,\r\neducation, human rights, and disaster relief, where efforts\r\non a volunteer basis complement governmental activities in\r\nthese fields at the grass-roots level. The need for volunteer\r\nefforts is greater now than ever before and likely to grow\r\ngreater still. Yet, while the contribution of volunteers is\r\nvast, much of their work often goes unrecognized because\r\nit does not involve the payment of market wages and\r\nbecause it is often spontaneous, informal and unstructured.\r\nIn the field of activities of the United Nations, the\r\nUnited Nations Volunteers programme has, since its\r\ninauguration in 1971, been sending volunteers to serve in\r\nvarious areas such as development cooperation,\r\nhumanitarian assistance and election support, responding to\r\nthe needs of the international community and often\r\ncomplementing the work of United Nations agencies\r\noperating in these fields, while also extending support to\r\nvolunteer activities in the international community. The\r\nprogramme plays a significant and valuable role that\r\ncomplements the activities of the United Nations as an\r\nintegral part of them, and thereby increases the\r\neffectiveness of the activities of the United Nations as a\r\nwhole. As it is the sole organization in the United Nations\r\nsystem with a mandate to act as promoter of volunteerism,\r\ninternational support to the United Nations Volunteer\r\nProgramme should be further intensified.\r\nThe Government of Japan believes that the\r\nproclamation of an International Year of Volunteers would\r\nextend recognition and give increased legitimacy to\r\nvolunteering, and as a result would expand significantly the\r\nnumber of people willing to offer their services. We believe\r\nthat the year 2001, the opening year of the new century,\r\nwill be a most auspicious moment to assess past\r\nachievements and give volunteer activities fresh\r\nencouragement. I wish to express the hope that all Member\r\nStates will reaffirm and support the efforts of volunteers to\r\ncontribute to the health and well-being of people\r\neverywhere, and endorse the draft resolution proclaiming\r\nthe International Year of Volunteers at this fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nThe specific objectives of the Year would be to\r\nencourage increased recognition, facilitation, networking\r\nand promotion of volunteer service. As the forms and\r\nstatus of volunteering vary by country and by region, the\r\nInternational Year of Volunteers would be engendered\r\nfrom the locality and grassroots upward, and would not\r\ntake the form of a world summit on volunteerism. Under\r\nour draft resolution, the United Nations Volunteer\r\nProgramme will be designated as the focal point for the\r\npromotion of the Year in the United Nations system; the\r\nProgramme can offer useful service as a facilitator in\r\npreparing for and implementing the Year, in close\r\ncollaboration with Governments, the United Nations\r\nsystem and civil society.\r\nThe Assembly has before it two draft resolutions\r\nproclaiming the year 2001 the International Year of\r\nVolunteers. As a matter of procedure, the Secretariat\r\ndistributed draft resolution A/52/L.21, which has the same\r\ncontent as the resolution adopted at the substantive\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council last July.\r\nHowever, there are 123 sponsors of draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.22; in addition to those countries mentioned in it,\r\nthey now include Barbados, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam,\r\nthe Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Liberia,\r\nNepal, Norway, Mali, Paraguay, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Uruguay.\r\nAll of them have become sponsors after the submission\r\nof the draft resolution, and would like to propose that\r\naction be taken only on A/52/L.22, the shorter version of\r\nthe draft resolution. Draft resolution A/52/L.22 represents\r\nthe result of efforts by the sponsors to avoid the repetition\r\nof adopting in the General Assembly a draft resolution\r\nwith precisely the same content as the resolution adopted\r\nby the Economic and Social Council. Accordingly,\r\nA/52/L.21 can be seen as a reference to A/52/L.22. I hope\r\nthat this proposal of the sponsors, guided by the spirit of\r\ndesiring to rationalize the work of the General Assembly,\r\nwill be accepted in that spirit by all Member States.\r\nThe Acting President: In view of the statement by\r\nthe representative of Japan, may I take it that the General\r\nAssembly decides not to take action on draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.21?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now take\r\na decision on draft resolutions A/52/L.15, L.18 and L.22,\r\none by one.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A/52/L.15, entitled\r\n“Proclamation of the year 2000 as the International Year\r\nfor the Culture of Peace”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.15?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.15 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/15).\r\nThe Acting President: We turn next to draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.18, entitled “Year 2000: International\r\nYear of Thanksgiving”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.18?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.18 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/16).\r\nThe Acting President: We now turn to draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.22, entitled “International Year of\r\nVolunteers, 2001”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.22?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.22 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/17).\r\nThe Acting President: We have thus concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 12.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother appointments\r\nReports of the Fifth Committee\r\nThe Acting President: In view of recent\r\ndevelopments pertaining to sub-item (e), “Appointment of\r\nmembers of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal”,\r\nthe consideration of that sub-item is postponed to a later\r\ndate to be announced.\r\nIf there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nnot to discuss the reports of the Fifth Committee which are\r\nbefore the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Before we begin to take\r\naction on the recommendations contained in the reports of\r\nthe Fifth Committee, I should like to advise\r\nrepresentatives that we shall proceed to take decisions in\r\nthe same manner as was done in the Fifth Committee.\r\n(a) Appointment of members of the Advisory\r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/52/670)\r\nThe Acting President: The Fifth Committee\r\nrecommends in paragraph 8 of its report that the General\r\nAssembly should appoint the following persons as\r\nmembers of the Advisory Committee on Administrative\r\nand Budgetary Questions for a three-year term of office\r\nbeginning on 1 January 1998: Mr. Ioan Barac, Mr. Hasan\r\nJawarneh, Mr. Mahamane Amadou Maiga, Mr. E. Besley\r\nMaycock and Mr. C. S. M. Mselle.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to appoint\r\nthose persons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(b) Appointment of members of the Committee on\r\nContributions\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/52/671)\r\nThe Acting President: In paragraph 7 of the report,\r\nthe Fifth Committee recommends that the General\r\nAssembly should appoint the following persons as\r\nmembers of the Committee on Contributions for a three-\r\nyear term of office beginning on 1 January 1998:\r\nMr. Uldis Blukis, Mr. David Etuket, Mr. Ihor V.\r\nHumenny, Mr. David Leis, Mr. Prakash Shah and\r\nMr. Kazuo Watanabe.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nappoint the persons recommended above?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(c) Appointment of a member of the Board of\r\nAuditors\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/52/672)\r\nThe Acting President: In paragraph 4 of the report,\r\nthe Fifth Committee recommends that the General\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nAssembly should appoint the Comptroller and Auditor-\r\nGeneral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland as a member of the United Nations Board\r\nof Auditors for a three-year term of office beginning on 1\r\nJuly 1998.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to appoint this\r\nperson?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(d) Confirmation of the appointment of members of\r\nthe Investments Committee\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/52/673)\r\nThe Acting President: The Fifth Committee, in\r\nparagraph 4 of its report, recommends that the General\r\nAssembly should confirm the appointment by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the following persons as members of the\r\nInvestments Committee for a three-year term of office\r\nbeginning on 1 January 1998: Mr. Ahmad Abdullatif,\r\nMr. Fernando Chico Pardo and Mr. J. Y. Pillay.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconfirm the appointment of those persons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(f) Appointment of members of the International Civil\r\nService Commission\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/52/675)\r\nThe Acting President: In paragraph 5 of the report,\r\nthe Fifth Committee recommends that the General\r\nAssembly should appoint the following persons as members\r\nof the International Civil Service Commission for a four-\r\nyear term of office beginning on 1 January 1998:\r\nMr. Mario Bettati, Mr. Joao Augusto de Medicis,\r\nMs. Lucretia Myers, Mr. Alexis Stephanou and Mr. Ku\r\nTashiro.\r\nIn the same paragraph, the Fifth Committee also\r\nrecommends that the General Assembly should appoint\r\nMr. Alexei Fedotov to fill the remainder of a four-year\r\nterm of office expiring on 31 December 2000.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly appoints these\r\npersons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of sub-items (a) to (d) and sub-item (f) of\r\nagenda item 17?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(g) Appointment of members and alternate members\r\nof the United Nations Staff Pension Committee\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/52/676)\r\nThe Acting President: In paragraph 5 of the report,\r\nthe Fifth Committee recommends that the General\r\nAssembly should appoint the following persons as\r\nmembers of the United Nations Staff Pension Committee\r\nfor a three-year term of office beginning on 1 January\r\n1998: Mr. Tadanori Inomata, Mr. Gerhard Kuntzle,\r\nMr. Vladimir V. Kuznetsov, Mr. Philip Richard Okanda\r\nOwade, Mr. Carlos Dante Riva and Ms. Susan Shearouse.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly appoints\r\nthese persons?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Fifth Committee also\r\ndecided to postpone to a later meeting the remaining two\r\nappointments, from the group of African States and the\r\ngroup of Asian States, respectively.\r\nWe have concluded this stage of our consideration\r\nof sub-item (g) of agenda item 17.\r\nAgenda item 34\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/313)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.20)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.20.\r\nMr. Asadi (Islamic Republic of Iran): Let me first\r\nexpress our sincere gratitude and appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the report contained in document\r\nA/52/313, which was prepared in response to paragraph\r\n7 of resolution 51/21 of 27 November 1996. It is a very\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\ngood, interesting and informative report, which renders it\r\nunnecessary for me to go into details.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran attaches great importance\r\nto regional cooperation. We believe that the current trend\r\ntowards strengthening regional cooperation will certainly\r\ncontribute not only to the well-being of the people of\r\nregional countries but also to the growth of the world\r\neconomy. From our perspective, the United Nations in its\r\nentirety, and its specialized agencies and funds and\r\nprogrammes in particular, can indeed play a very active and\r\nconstructive role in this regard. The United Nations system\r\ncan, inter alia, contribute to identifying areas of, and\r\nexploring potential for, subregional, regional and\r\ninterregional cooperation. The important and valuable\r\nactivities currently being undertaken in this regard by the\r\nregional commissions deserve to be commended. In this\r\nparticular connection, the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nwelcomes and supports the efforts of the Economic and\r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in\r\npromoting cooperation between major subregional\r\norganizations in Asia and the Pacific, including the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO). The third\r\nconsultative meeting of the heads of ECO, the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which\r\nwas coordinated by ESCAP and held at Tehran, Iran,\r\nconstitutes a prominent example of the effective\r\ncontribution of regional commissions to the promotion of\r\nregional-development cooperation.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, as one of the founders\r\nof the Economic Cooperation Organization, which\r\ncomprises 10 countries from West, South and Central Asia\r\nand the Caucasus, spares no efforts for the realization of\r\nECO objectives. As host to the ECO headquarters in\r\nTehran, Iran continues to contribute to the strengthening\r\nand expanding of ECO\u0027s role and activities in various fields,\r\nin accordance with the development policies and priorities\r\nof its member States. We are happy to note that ECO has\r\nbeen able to register impressive achievements in such\r\nvaried fields as communications, land, sea and air\r\ntransportation, networks of transnational oil and gas\r\npipelines, energy, trade, exchange of information and\r\nhuman-resource development.\r\nDevelopment of infrastructure in the ECO region is\r\nconsidered a vital area for enhanced regional economic\r\ncooperation. Transport and communications, along with\r\nenergy and water supplies, are of particular importance to\r\nECO members. With the inauguration in 1996 of the\r\nMashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railroad linking Iran and\r\nTurkmenistan the long-cherished dream of access to free\r\nwaters by the landlocked countries of Central Asia finally\r\ncame true. This new facility opened a valuable window of\r\nopportunity to the Central Asian landlocked countries to\r\nembark on the expansion of their trade ties with the\r\noutside world through the Iranian nationwide railroad\r\nsystem, providing those countries with the shortest and\r\nmost economical access to the major seaports of the\r\nPersian Gulf in the southern direction and to Europe in\r\nthe western direction.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and\r\nsubregional and regional organizations, as recognized and\r\nencouraged by the Charter, is bound to have a positive\r\nimpact not only on the daily lives of the peoples in the\r\nregions but also on the promotion of peace and stability\r\nat all levels. The Islamic Republic of Iran is fully\r\ncognizant of the multidimensional, positive impact of\r\nregional economic cooperation and also of the\r\nconstructive role of the United Nations system in this\r\nprocess. We support the current cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and ECO and encourage the relevant\r\nUnited Nations bodies, agencies, funds and programmes\r\nto strengthen further their consultation, cooperation and\r\ncoordination with ECO in various fields and areas. Higher\r\nand better utilization of the enormous potentialities in the\r\nECO region in different fields and areas will certainly be\r\nbeneficial, both within and outside the region.\r\nI should now like to introduce, on behalf of the\r\nsponsors, draft resolution A/52/L.20 and to point out a\r\nnumber of changes, which I shall present orally at the end\r\nof my introduction.\r\nRepresenting the delegation of the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran, the current coordinator of the ECO contact group\r\nin New York, I have the honour to introduce to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, on behalf of its sponsors the draft\r\nresolution under the agenda item entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization”. The report of the United\r\nNations Secretary-General on the agenda item under\r\nconsideration shows that cooperation between the United\r\nNations and ECO has evolved in a satisfactory manner\r\nand presents a very promising outlook. Optimal utilization\r\nof the existing potentialities in the ECO region in various\r\nfields and areas will indeed be much facilitated and\r\nrendered more efficient and effective through the\r\nassistance of the United Nations system, in particular its\r\nspecialized agencies involved in the field of operational\r\nactivities.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.20 is, as a matter of fact, an\r\nupdated version of a similar resolution adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly last year, with, of course, a few\r\nadditions. It reflects the state of cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations. While laying out the background of that\r\ncooperation and taking stock of the achievements so far, the\r\ndraft resolution is also forward-looking in its approach to\r\nthe future.\r\nAddressing the future of a positively evolving\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and ECO, the draft\r\nresolution spells out the areas of general cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations system and also puts forward a number\r\nof areas of priority for ECO and its member States. I shall\r\nunderline just a few of the salient points in this regard.\r\nThe draft resolution invites the Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations to continue his efforts, in consultation\r\nwith his ECO counterpart, to promote and expand\r\ncooperation and coordination between the two\r\norganizations. It urges the United Nations specialized\r\nagencies and other organizations and programmes of the\r\nsystem to continue and increase consultations and\r\ncooperation with ECO. It invites relevant international\r\nfinancial institutions to give appropriate consideration to\r\nECO\u0027s projects and programmes, including those in the\r\nECO priority areas of transport and communications, and it\r\ninvites ESCAP to play a more active role in promoting\r\ncooperation with ECO.\r\nI should now, on behalf of the sponsors, like to\r\nindicate some changes to the text, which I shall present\r\norally.\r\nIn the second line of the fourth preambular paragraph,\r\nwhich begins “Bearing in mind,” the year “1997” should be\r\ncorrected to “1977”, and the year “1977” farther along in\r\nthat line should be changed to “1996”.\r\nIn paragraph 6, the words “Calls upon” at the\r\nbeginning of the paragraph should be replaced with the\r\nword “Invites”. In the second line of the same paragraph,\r\nthe first word, “favourable,” should be replaced with the\r\nword “appropriate”.\r\nLastly, in paragraph 8, line 5, the words “inter alia”\r\nshould be inserted after the words “technical assistance”.\r\nTo conclude, let me just add on behalf of the sponsors\r\nof draft resolution A/52/L.20, as orally amended, that this\r\ndraft resolution represents a humble effort on the part of a\r\ndynamic regional organization in a sensitive area of the\r\nworld. It reflects the dedication of ECO to the further\r\npromotion of regional cooperation and the attainment of\r\nhigher levels of economic well-being and development for\r\nits member States and the region at large.\r\nHaving said that, on behalf of the sponsors, I invite\r\nthe General Assembly to adopt by consensus the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/52/L.20, as orally\r\namended, as the Assembly did in the case of a similar\r\ndraft resolution last year.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 48/2 of 13 October 1993, I now call\r\non the Secretary-General of the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization, Mr. Onder Ozar.\r\nMr. Ozar (Economic Cooperation Organization): As\r\nthe Secretary-General of the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO), it is my privilege and honour to\r\naddress this body on an agenda item which is of vital\r\nimportance for the member States of our organization.\r\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization is a\r\nregional grouping devoted to the socio-economic well-\r\nbeing of its 10 member States, which are located in a\r\nregion that encompasses more than 7 million square\r\nkilometres and is inhabited by nearly 320 million people.\r\nIn this richly endowed region, ECO is playing a pivotal\r\nrole to promote economic cooperation among member\r\ncountries and provide the framework for an infrastructural\r\nnetwork connecting the newly independent Republics of\r\nCentral Asia and Azerbaijan to the rest of the world\r\nthrough the road, maritime and air links of the\r\nneighbouring countries: Iran, Pakistan and Turkey.\r\nI would like to inform representatives that soon after\r\nits expansion in November 1992 from three to 10 member\r\nStates, ECO embarked upon a comprehensive\r\nrestructuring and reorganization. Two plans of action\r\nwere adopted in 1993, namely the Quetta Plan of Action\r\nand the Istanbul Declaration, both stipulating concrete\r\ntargets to be achieved in the next 10 years, as well as a\r\nproject-oriented Almaty Outline Plan for the Development\r\nof Transport Sector in the ECO Region. Lately, at the\r\nFourth ECO Summit Meeting in Ashgabat in May 1996,\r\nan overall strategy for the ECO region and several\r\ndocuments on the reorganization and restructuring of ECO\r\nwere adopted. Moreover, steps have been taken to\r\nestablish regional institutions. Currently, ECO is in the\r\nprocess of implementing those decisions.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 50th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 20 November 1997\r\nSo as to pursue our objectives in a coordinated manner\r\nand in harmony with the global trends, we are working\r\nclosely with the United Nations and its specialized agencies\r\ntowards the attainment of our common objectives in the\r\nECO region. ECO acquired observer status at the United\r\nNations on 13 October 1993 through resolution 48/2.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and ECO has been\r\nfurther strengthened through the adoption of resolutions\r\n50/1 and 51/21, adopted respectively on 12 October 1995\r\nand 27 November 1996. These resolutions are helping to\r\nfacilitate and strengthen ECO\u0027s relations with the major\r\nagencies of the United Nations system. We have established\r\ncooperative relationships with several United Nations\r\nagencies and funds and programmes that are now carrying\r\nout joint activities with ECO. They include the United\r\nNations Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization (UNIDO), the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP) and the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA). ECO has jointly held three\r\nimportant conferences with UNFPA and four workshops\r\nwith UNICEF. Our cooperation with the Economic and\r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has\r\nalso grown considerably and is expanding. Currently,\r\nseveral projects are being carried out jointly. UNDCP has\r\nalso worked out a project proposal to assist in the\r\nimplementation of ECO\u0027s plan on drug control. Similarly,\r\nUNDP is preparing a study on the economies and resource\r\ncomplementarities of ECO member States, a draft of which\r\nhas already been circulated among member States. The\r\nholding of a workshop, with the participation of UNDP, to\r\ndiscuss the outcome of this study is under consideration.\r\nAlso, another study on enhancing the effectiveness of the\r\nnew wing of the ECO secretariat comprising research and\r\nproject units has been carried out by a UNDP senior\r\nconsultant. We are grateful to have received the working\r\ndraft of this study, which has been circulated among\r\nmember States for consideration.\r\nIn view of the growing trend towards interregional\r\ncooperation, ECO is also part of an annual consultative\r\nprocess with Asia\u0027s major subregional organizations, which\r\nis coordinated by ESCAP. The third consultative meeting\r\nof the heads of these organizations was held in Tehran last\r\nMay. Details of these joint efforts of ECO and United\r\nNations agencies are reflected in good measure in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General of 29 August 1997, which is\r\ncontained in document A/52/313 and has been submitted\r\nunder the present agenda item.\r\nIn my view, we have now reached a stage where we\r\nneed to evolve a joint strategy for closer cooperation and\r\ncoordination between ECO and the United Nations\r\nagencies to pursue the optimum utilization of\r\nopportunities offered by the vast human and resource\r\npotential of the ECO region. The draft resolution\r\nsubmitted under this agenda item reflects this need and\r\nalso provides a number of proposals and guidelines for\r\nfuture courses of action. I seek the cooperation of all\r\nmembers in supporting the draft resolution that is before\r\nthe General Assembly, which, among other things, calls\r\nupon the relevant international financial institutions to\r\ngive favourable consideration to helping to implement\r\nregional infrastructural plans and projects, including ECO\r\nprogrammes spelt out in the important Declaration\r\nadopted at the Extraordinary Summit Meeting held in\r\nAshgabat in May 1997. That Declaration, inter alia,\r\nprovides for the establishment of a comprehensive\r\ntransport and communications infrastructure and a\r\nnetwork of transnational oil and gas pipelines in the ECO\r\nregion. In fact, this programme aims at providing the\r\nlandlocked countries in the region with greater mobility\r\nto promote interregional trade and to establish mutually\r\nbeneficial economic and commercial interaction with\r\nother regions for greater cooperation between the two\r\norganizations in the years ahead.\r\nBefore I conclude my statement, I wish to thank\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, for extending his full cooperation to our\r\norganization in promoting our shared aims and economic\r\ndevelopment objectives in the region.
