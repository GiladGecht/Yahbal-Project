(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nreports of the General Committee\r\nSecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/52/250/Add.1)\r\nThe President: This morning, I first draw the\r\nattention of representatives to the second report of the\r\nGeneral Committee, which is contained in document\r\nA/52/250/Add.1, concerning a request by Guyana and\r\nJamaica for the inclusion in the agenda of an additional\r\nitem entitled “Admission of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority to membership in the United Nations Joint Staff\r\nPension Fund”.\r\nIn paragraph 2 of the report, the General Committee\r\ndecided to recommend to the General Assembly that the\r\nitem entitled “Admission of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority to membership in the United Nations Joint Staff\r\nPension Fund” be included in the agenda of the current\r\nsession.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\ninclude this additional item in the agenda of the current\r\nsession?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The General Committee further\r\ndecided to recommend to the General Assembly that the\r\nadditional item be allocated to the Fifth Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\nallocate this item to the Fifth Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The Chairman of the Fifth\r\nCommittee will be informed of the decision just taken.\r\nAgenda item 16 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother elections\r\n(c) Election of nineteen members of the United\r\nNations Commission on International Trade Law\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now\r\nturn to the election of 19 members of the United Nations\r\nCommission on International Trade Law to replace those\r\nmembers whose term of office expires on 31 May 1998.\r\nThe 19 outgoing members are Argentina, Austria,\r\nChile, Ecuador, Hungary, India, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, Italy, Kenya, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Spain,\r\nthe Sudan, Thailand, Uganda, the United Republic of\r\nTanzania, the United States of America and Uruguay.\r\nThose members are eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nI should like to remind members that, as of l June\r\n1998, the following States will continue to be represented\r\non the Commission: Algeria, Australia, Botswana, Brazil,\r\nBulgaria, Cameroon, China, Egypt, Finland, France,\r\nGermany, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, the Russian Federation,\r\nSingapore and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland. Therefore, those 17 States are not eligible\r\nfor election, since they are members of the Commission.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nthe election shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be\r\nno nominations.\r\nHowever, I wish to recall paragraph 16 of General\r\nAssembly decision 34/401, whereby the practice of\r\ndispensing with the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary\r\norgans when the number of candidates corresponds to the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard, unless\r\na delegation specifically requests a vote on a given election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that the\r\nAssembly decides to proceed to the election on that basis?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Regarding candidatures, I have been\r\ninformed by the Chairmen of the respective regional groups\r\nthat, for the four vacant seats from among the African\r\nStates, the four endorsed candidates are Burkina Faso,\r\nKenya, the Sudan and Uganda.\r\nFrom among the Asian States, the four endorsed\r\ncandidates for four seats are Fiji, India, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran and Thailand.\r\nFrom among the Eastern European States, there are\r\nfour candidates for three seats. The candidates are the\r\nCzech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania and Romania.\r\nAs for the four seats from among the Latin American\r\nand Caribbean States, the endorsed candidates are\r\nColombia, Honduras and Paraguay. The group has also\r\nendorsed Argentina and Uruguay for the fourth seat on the\r\nunderstanding that Argentina and Uruguay will alternate\r\nrepresentation on an annual basis, starting with Argentina.\r\nThis arrangement is within the power of the General\r\nAssembly, which established the Commission and\r\ndetermined its composition by General Assembly resolution\r\n2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966.\r\nFor the four seats from among the Western European\r\nand other States, there are five candidates, namely,\r\nAustria, Greece, Italy, Spain and the United States of America.\r\nSince the number of candidates endorsed by the\r\nAfrican States, the Asian States and the Latin American\r\nand Caribbean States, with Argentina and Uruguay\r\nalternating on an annual basis, corresponds to the number\r\nof seats to be filled in each group, may I therefore declare\r\nthose candidates elected for a six-year term beginning on\r\nl June 1998, bearing in mind that Argentina and Uruguay\r\nwill alternate representation on an annual basis, starting\r\nwith Argentina?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: With regard to the Eastern European\r\nStates and the Western European and other States, the\r\nnumber of candidates exceeds the number of vacancies\r\nallocated to those regions. Therefore, the Assembly will\r\nproceed to a vote by secret ballot to elect three members\r\nfrom the Eastern European States and four members from\r\nthe Western European and other States.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the\r\nnumber of candidates not exceeding the number of seats\r\nto be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and\r\nnot less than the majority required, will be declared\r\nelected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat,\r\nthere will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates\r\nwhich have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Ballot papers marked “C” and “E”\r\nwill now be distributed. I request representatives to use\r\nonly those ballot papers and to write on them the names\r\nof the three States from among the Eastern European\r\nStates and the names of the four States from among the\r\nWestern European and other States for which they want\r\nto vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it\r\nwill be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a\r\nballot paper which do not belong to that region shall not\r\nbe counted.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Nyein\r\n(Myanmar), Mr. Contreras (Venezuela) and\r\nMr. Buhera (Zimbabwe) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11.30 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as follows:\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 164\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 164\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of members voting: 162\r\nRequired majority: 82\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nLithuania 133\r\nHungary 111\r\nRomania 110\r\nCzech Republic 106\r\nUkraine 2\r\nSlovakia 1\r\nGroup E — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 164\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 164\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of Members voting: 163\r\nRequired majority: 82\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nItaly 140\r\nSpain 138\r\nAustria 136\r\nUnited States 115\r\nGreece 96\r\nAustria, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Romania, Spain\r\nand the United States of America, having obtained the\r\nrequired majority and having received the greatest\r\nnumber of votes, were elected members of the United\r\nNations Commission on International Trade Law for\r\na six-year term beginning on 1 June 1998.\r\nThe President: The following 18 States are therefore\r\nelected members of the United Nations Commission on\r\nInternational Trade Law for a six-year term beginning on\r\n1 June 1998: Austria, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Fiji,\r\nHonduras, Hungary, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nItaly, Kenya, Lithuania, Paraguay, Romania, Spain, the\r\nSudan, Thailand, Uganda and the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nArgentina and Uruguay were elected to alternate\r\nrepresentation on an annual basis, starting with Argentina.\r\nI congratulate the States which have been elected\r\nmembers of the United Nations Commission on\r\nInternational Trade Law, and I thank the tellers for their\r\nassistance in this election. And I apologize for the long\r\ndelay in counting the votes.\r\nThis concludes our consideration of sub-item (c) of\r\nagenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 42\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/374)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.8)\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nZimbabwe to introduce draft resolution A/52/L.8.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nMr. Mapuranga (Zimbabwe): This morning I shall\r\nbe wearing two caps as I address the General Assembly\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). In the first part of\r\nmy statement, I shall be introducing the draft resolution\r\non United Nations/OAU cooperation, and I shall do so on\r\nbehalf of member States of the OAU. In the second part\r\nof my statement, I shall be speaking as Head of the\r\ndelegation of Zimbabwe, and I shall signal to the\r\nAssembly when I make the transition.\r\nIt is my honour, as the representative of the current\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.8 on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity, a\r\nrelationship which has spanned three decades. This\r\ncooperation has involved the United Nations Secretariat\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nand the various specialized agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nThe establishment of an OAU Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution and the\r\ndetermination of the organization to become proactive,\r\nespecially in the areas of preventive diplomacy, conflict\r\nresolution and post-conflict peace-building, has made that\r\ncooperation not only more important but more urgent in\r\nterms of achieving the desired objectives.\r\nThe manifested desire of the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, to\r\nstrengthen that cooperation has resulted in intensive and\r\nextensive consultations, exchange of information and\r\nperiodic meetings between him and the Secretary-General\r\nof the OAU, Salim Ahmed Salim. They have for the first\r\ntime agreed to institutionalize their meetings and to meet\r\nalternately in Africa, when the OAU summit convenes, and\r\nin New York during the annual session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThis draft resolution on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity is\r\nbeing submitted in the wake of two important events that\r\ntook place, first in Harare, Zimbabwe, in June this year,\r\nand here at the United Nations on 25 September this year,\r\nwhen the Security Council met in a special meeting at the\r\nministerial level. At each of those meetings, the Chairman\r\nof the OAU spoke on behalf of the people of Africa about\r\nthe issues of democratization, peace and security and, most\r\nimportantly, development.\r\nThe draft resolution before the Assembly outlines both\r\nthe political and economic challenges facing Africa and the\r\nurgent need for the international community to respond in\r\npractical terms and in the spirit of the appeal the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations made before the special\r\nmeeting of the Security Council, when he said:\r\n“We — and I speak not only of this Council but of\r\nthe United Nations and the international community\r\ngenerally — must respond promptly and effectively to\r\nAfrica’s call. We must do so with specific measures\r\nand clear proposals for action.” [S/PV.3819, p. 5].\r\nThe draft resolution on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity\r\noutlines specific measures and clear proposals that require\r\nurgent action on the part of the United Nations Secretariat\r\nin particular and the international community in general.\r\nIt would be remiss of the OAU not to express its\r\nappreciation for the generous support and assistance that\r\nit has so far received from a number of countries and\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nI conclude with the words of the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General himself, when he said in relation to\r\nAfrica during the ministerial meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil:\r\n“We have dissected and debated Africa, and\r\nstudied and summarized its challenges, for decades.\r\nNow is the time for action.” [supra, p. 5]\r\nI therefore have the honour to submit draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.8 for consideration and adoption by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt is now my wish to make a few remarks on behalf\r\nof the delegation of Zimbabwe. Let me express my\r\ndelegation’s deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of African Unity (A/52/374). My\r\ndelegation welcomes this report, as it demonstrates the\r\npractical working relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of African Unity in such areas as\r\nexchange of information, peace and security, and\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nThis debate comes at an opportune time, when\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, a cooperation which was\r\nborn 32 years ago,1 in 1965, has substantially expanded\r\nin scope. Not only has the OAU been actively involved in\r\nthe work of strengthening cooperation and unity among\r\nAfrican countries, it has also made considerable\r\ncontributions to the work of the United Nations,\r\nparticularly in the sphere of the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity, in line with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter on the role of regional\r\norganizations.\r\nThe past year has been eventful in Africa’s social,\r\neconomic and political spheres. Africa’s political\r\nsuccesses in the area of decolonization have been\r\ntarnished by the prevalence of insecurity and civil strife\r\nin some parts of the continent. Fighting has been going on\r\nin varying degrees in Sudan, in Somalia and in the Great\r\nLakes region. Zimbabwe welcomes efforts to promote\r\npeace through regional organizations as well as through\r\ngood-neighbourliness. The OAU mechanism for the\r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflict was\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\ncreated in 1993 to serve this purpose. We count on the\r\ncontinued support of the United Nations, particularly in\r\ntechnical, logistical and material terms, to ensure that these\r\nregional arrangements are strengthened and sustained. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the initiative of the United Nations to\r\ntrain and familiarize staff from the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community’s (SADC) Organ on Politics,\r\nDefence and Security and the OAU Conflict Prevention\r\nDivision with the United Nations Department of Political\r\nAffairs.\r\nIt is our belief that cooperation between the two\r\norganizations should go beyond peace and security. The\r\nthirty-third session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State\r\nand Government, which my country hosted, convened the\r\ninaugural session of the African Economic Community.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and subregional\r\neconomic groupings such as SADC, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\r\n(COMESA) should be established, and, where they exist,\r\nshould be strengthened. My delegation is of the hope that\r\nsuch efforts will continue to enjoy the tangible support of\r\nthe international community and the United Nations system\r\nas a whole.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that the United Nations\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, if scrupulously implemented,\r\ncould help create an enabling environment for the much\r\nneeded economic growth and prosperity of the African\r\ncontinent. It should further strengthen ongoing efforts by\r\nthe United Nations and the OAU towards eradicating\r\npoverty and achieving sustainable development.\r\nFinally, cooperation between the OAU and the United\r\nNations should buttress the resolve of African countries to\r\novercome the present obstacles and to launch the continent\r\non the path of economic recovery and growth. The Africa\r\nof the mass media has been one of monumental human\r\ntragedy, but today we are witnessing an African renaissance\r\nwhich needs to be supported by the United Nations and by\r\nthe entire international community.\r\nMr. Wolzfeld (Luxembourg) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour to be speaking on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. The Central and Eastern European\r\ncountries associated with the European Union — Bulgaria,\r\nthe Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated country of\r\nCyprus align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union thanks the Secretary-General\r\nfor his exhaustive report on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU). The European Union considers that regional\r\norganizations have a growing role to play in today’s\r\nworld and stresses the particular importance of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU.\r\nThe role of regional organizations may prove particularly\r\neffective given that those organizations represent member\r\nStates in their individual capacities. The importance which\r\nthe Union attaches to Africa is based on common\r\ninterests, values and objectives: the desire to help Africa\r\nto achieve peace, stability and sustainable development in\r\norder to improve the quality of life of its peoples.\r\nThe Organization of African Unity and subregional\r\norganizations in Africa provide an appropriate framework\r\nfor dialogue and cooperation to that end. We welcome the\r\nimportant role played by the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) and by the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) — and in\r\nparticular the efforts carried out in Liberia by its\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). Likewise, the European\r\nUnion welcomes the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the\r\nImplementation of the Bangui Agreement in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic. In East Africa, we have noted the\r\ninteresting initiatives taken by the East African\r\nCooperation body and by the Intergovernmental Authority\r\non Development (IGAD).\r\nFor those reasons, the European Union encourages\r\nthe regular contacts and dialogue it holds with regional\r\norganizations in Africa, and in particular its continuing\r\ndialogue with the OAU. In this context, the European\r\nUnion welcomes the first ministerial meeting between\r\ntroikas of the OAU and of the European Union, held at\r\nNew York on 23 June 1997. The purpose of the meeting\r\nwas to take stock of the process of regular political\r\nconsultations at senior-official level between the OAU\r\nand the European Union initiated in 1994 and to pave the\r\nway for future cooperation. On 26 and 27 June 1997, the\r\nEuropean Union presidency and the European\r\nCommission visited Addis Ababa to discuss how to\r\nfinalize a plan for expanding the ability of the OAU to\r\nprocess the information necessary for preventive\r\ndiplomacy. Similarly, the European Union has been in\r\ncontact with the members of SADC to set a date for a\r\nmeeting of senior officials planned for December 1997 at\r\nLusaka.\r\nOn 16 and 17 June 1997, at the Amsterdam meeting\r\nof the European Council, the Council stated that it looked\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nforward to a year-2000 summit meeting of Heads of State\r\nor Government of the European Union and of Africa. The\r\nUnion attaches great importance to the preparations for that\r\nsummit with a view to achieving tangible results. The goal\r\nof the summit will be to establish a broad political dialogue\r\nat the highest level between the European Union and\r\nAfrica, which will make it possible to develop a more\r\neffective and better integrated relationship between our two\r\ncontinents.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the OAU\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution in Africa; we are convinced that this will be\r\nparticularly useful in helping to resolve conflicts and reduce\r\ntension. It is for Africans first and foremost to take the\r\ninitiative to restore peace on the continent and to take the\r\nprincipal responsibility for that peace. It is important for\r\nAfrican countries to have the capacity to participate in\r\npeacekeeping missions authorized by the Security Council.\r\nIn this respect, we welcome the efforts of countries that\r\nwish to shift from direct or bilateral military cooperation to\r\nactive support towards African countries in the framework\r\nof a multilateral approach in liaison with the United\r\nNations, the OAU and other partners.\r\nThe European Union provides concrete assistance in\r\nthis respect. On 2 June 1997 it adopted a common position\r\non the prevention and resolution of conflicts in Africa. The\r\nEuropean Union will strengthen its dialogue with the OAU\r\nand with subregional organizations on concrete\r\nopportunities for backing their efforts in the fields of early\r\nwarning, preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and in\r\npromoting awareness of the importance of respect for\r\nhuman rights, the rule of law, a pluralistic society,\r\ndemocratic institutions and practices and a culture of\r\ntolerance and peaceful coexistence.\r\nIn that context, the European Union welcomes the\r\ninitiative and action by the Secretaries-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and of the OAU to cooperate and consult\r\nwith one another regularly on major African issues. Since\r\nJanuary 1997 they have together examined the need to\r\nstrengthen their association in order to boost their mutual\r\nability to prevent and resolve conflicts in Africa. The\r\nappointment of Mr. Mohammed Sahnoun as joint United\r\nNations-OAU Special Representative for the Great Lakes\r\nregion, a mandate subsequently extended to the Congo,\r\nrepresents significant progress in that direction.\r\nThe European Union is pleased that the two\r\nSecretaries-General will henceforth meet twice a year, and\r\nit welcomes the meeting between the two Secretariats, to be\r\nheld in Addis Ababa in early December 1997, to define\r\nspecific measures for strengthening and widening that\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe European Union also welcomes the Security\r\nCouncil meeting at ministerial level on the situation in\r\nAfrica, which took place on 25 September 1997. We look\r\nforward to the Secretary-General’s report on this matter\r\nto be presented in February 1998.\r\nThe European Union recognizes the pre-eminent role\r\nof the United Nations in peacekeeping matters. It is\r\nconvinced of the need for the closest possible cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OAU. In this regard,\r\nwe note that Article 52 of the United Nations Charter\r\nrecognizes the special role which should be played by\r\nregional organizations.\r\nWhen we look at the African continent today, we\r\ncan see that there are grounds for confidence in the\r\nfuture. Democracy is taking root in an increasing number\r\nof States, and in a number of countries healthy debate is\r\nbeing conducted on the best way of adapting that\r\ndemocracy more directly to the needs of the population,\r\nencouraging the people to participate more fully in the\r\nconduct of public affairs and enabling them to have a\r\nmore direct influence on their own future. The OAU has\r\nan influential role — which, of course, means\r\nresponsibilities — and should encourage and endorse such\r\ndebate. It is for the international community, and\r\nparticularly the United Nations, to support the OAU in\r\nthis task. The European Union encourages intensification\r\nof the dialogue and cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OAU in these fields.\r\nWhile congratulating Africa on the substantial\r\nprogress it has made in its efforts to establish more\r\nwidespread democracy and to deal with the problems\r\narising within its borders, the European Union takes due\r\nnote of the serious concerns expressed by Africans\r\nthemselves over events occurring in a number of regions\r\nof their continent and over the anti-democratic trends\r\nnoted in some countries.\r\nThe European Union feels that it is its duty to speak\r\nout against attacks on democracy and to promote a\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. There are therefore\r\noccasions when we consider it necessary to make\r\npublic — in the United Nations or elsewhere — our\r\nconcern over events occurring in certain countries, in\r\nAfrica and elsewhere.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nThere is still not peace in the Great Lakes region, and\r\nthe adjacent countries have been affected by the conflict.\r\nThe European Union continues to lend its full support to\r\nefforts by the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, as well as by leaders in the region and other\r\neminent persons concerned, to restore peace there. The\r\nEuropean Union’s Special Envoy for the Great Lakes\r\nRegion, Mr. Aldo Ajello, will continue to collaborate\r\nclosely with them.\r\nThe European Union is still in favour of the\r\nconvening, under the auspices of both the United Nations\r\nand the OAU, of an international conference to deal\r\ncomprehensively with the situation in the Great Lakes\r\nregion. The Union would also emphasize the role that the\r\ninternational community can play in helping the countries\r\nof the region to resolve their problems.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\r\nEuropean Union will continue to urge President Kabila to\r\nput in hand without delay the electoral process, to be\r\ncarried out within the two-year period announced, and to\r\nhonour his agreement to facilitate the work of the\r\nhumanitarian organizations which aid and repatriate\r\nrefugees. It is imperative that the United Nations be able\r\nfreely to conduct its investigation into the alleged massacres\r\nand other violations of human rights in Congolese territory.\r\nAs to the Republic of the Congo, the European Union\r\nprofoundly regrets that the international mediation\r\nundertaken by President Bongo of Gabon and Mr.\r\nMohamed Sahnoun, the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the OAU, did\r\nnot succeed, and express our disapproval of the fact that the\r\npolitical crisis turned into an armed conflict which resulted\r\nin a change of government without the people of the Congo\r\nhaving an opportunity to express their opinion in free\r\nelections. The European Union asks the authorities to restart\r\nthe democratic process and to as soon as possible prepare\r\nfree, transparent and fair democratic elections, which should\r\ntake place under international supervision. The European\r\nUnion condemns all external interference in the Republic of\r\nthe Congo, especially the intervention of foreign forces, in\r\nviolation of the United Nations Charter, and asks that all\r\nforeign forces, including mercenaries, be withdrawn\r\nimmediately.\r\nThe European Union is concerned about the situation\r\nin Sierra Leone and welcomes the peace efforts made by\r\nthe States of the region. We express our concern over the\r\nworsening of the humanitarian situation in that country, and\r\nhope that Security Council resolution 1132 (1997) will\r\nallow for the speedy restoration of the democratically\r\nelected Government and a return to constitutional order.\r\nThe European Union calls upon ECOWAS to ensure that\r\nsanctions against Sierra Leone are imposed in full\r\ncompliance with resolution 1132 (1997) and with\r\ninternational law on humanitarian aid. We welcome the\r\nECOWAS peace plan for Sierra Leone published in\r\nConakry on 23 October 1997, and await with interest the\r\nevaluation of the United Nations Secretariat\r\nreconnaissance mission.\r\nAs regards Angola, we are extremely concerned over\r\nthe continued atmosphere of tension and the impasse in\r\nthe peace process. It is imperative that UNITA comply\r\nwith all its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol, which\r\nit voluntarily signed. For that reason, the European Union\r\nappeals to UNITA to comply without delay with the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolutions 1127 (1997)\r\nand 1135 (1997). The European Union is taking all\r\nmeasures to impose sanctions in accordance with those\r\nresolutions, and encourages all other States to do likewise.\r\nEconomic development continues to be the major\r\nchallenge to be met by Africa. The European Union is\r\nwell aware of this. It is encouraging to see that many\r\nAfrican countries have undertaken sweeping reforms of\r\ntheir economic policies and their public sectors, thereby\r\nenabling growth to recommence. They have also made\r\nsignificant and praiseworthy progress in essential sectors\r\nsuch as health, education and the provision of basic\r\nservices.\r\nAt the same time, the fact remains that half the\r\npopulation of sub-Saharan Africa lives below the poverty\r\nline. That poverty reminds us that economic and social\r\nprogress has not yet been achieved there. We feel that to\r\nreduce poverty the African countries should, with\r\nencouragement and support from the international\r\ncommunity, achieve and maintain a stable rate of per\r\ncapita income growth. Development programmes should\r\nalso have the objective of ensuring that the poorest groups\r\nof the population are their first beneficiaries.\r\nThe European Union will continue to play a decisive\r\nrole in helping Africa achieve these objectives. The\r\nframework for our aid is already in place by virtue of the\r\nLomé Convention, which is the cornerstone of our efforts.\r\nAid granted by the European Union under the Lomé\r\nConvention and the assistance that it gives through other\r\nsources make the European Union today the largest aid\r\ndonor in the world. The contribution of the European\r\nUnion represents more than 60 per cent of the total aid\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\ngiven to sub-Saharan Africa by countries from the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\n(OECD) zone. We reaffirm our determination to continue\r\nour effort to help African developing countries and to\r\nstrengthen our cooperation with them in order to better\r\nensure their future well-being and prosperity.\r\nThis is the essence of the consideration that we and\r\nour partners in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific have\r\ngiven to the future of the Lomé Convention. The European\r\nUnion is determined to preserve the specificity of this\r\nunique partnership, which links it to many African\r\ncountries.\r\nFor its part, Africa must accept its responsibilities so\r\nthat development may be sustainable and prosperity\r\nensured. Each Government is above all responsible for\r\nensuring that its people enjoy fundamental rights and\r\nfreedoms, while creating conditions favourable for\r\neconomic growth. All States also have responsibilities\r\ntowards the other States in their region and for their shared\r\nenvironment. Those responsibilities go far beyond the need\r\nto respect each other’s sovereignty.\r\nThe Organization of African Unity has played an\r\nimportant role by determining these responsibilities,\r\nstudying ways of guaranteeing that they are honoured and\r\nhelping to define a common vision for the future of the\r\nAfrican continent. The European Union is convinced that\r\nthe Organization of African Unity, with the help and\r\ncooperation of the international community, in particular the\r\nUnited Nations, will take up the challenge of helping Africa\r\nto enter the next millennium with confidence and\r\ndetermination.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): My delegation welcomes\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU). The world community is cognisant of the fact that\r\nAfrica is a continent that has not only been faced with the\r\ndifficulties of economic and social development, but has\r\nalso suffered a large number of conflicts between and\r\nwithin its nation States. The origins of the conflicts are\r\ncomplex, encompassing economic, political, cultural and\r\nsocial parameters. Among the international factors, conflicts\r\nhave been manifested as a consequence of the end of the\r\ncold war and its aftermath, as well as of the globalization\r\nand liberalization of the world economy, which have\r\ngenerated a sense of political and economic insecurity in Africa.\r\nA host of problems in Africa result from these\r\nconflicts. One such problem is the question of Africa’s\r\nrefugee crisis, which is not diminishing. Millions of\r\nAfrican refugees and displaced persons, representing the\r\nhighest numbers in world refugee flows, have brought\r\nabout a potential source of further tension within and\r\nbetween States. As such, refugee assistance and the\r\nprotection of refugee rights are a priority in the\r\nprevention and management of conflict and the building\r\nof peace and security in our region.\r\nMy delegation supports the view that, as stated in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization, in document A/52/1, it is a primary aim of\r\nthe United Nations to expand the domain of peaceful\r\nchange to ensure that Member States do not resort to\r\nviolence, by providing means through which conflicts\r\nmay be contained and resolved and by dealing with their\r\nroot causes. In this regard, it is encouraging to note that\r\nthe United Nations is committed to cooperating with\r\nregional organizations. This strategy offers great potential.\r\nThe appointment of a joint United Nations-OAU Special\r\nRepresentative is a commendable effort, aimed at\r\nenhancing close contact between the Secretariats of the\r\nUnited Nations and the OAU. It is our hope that the\r\nSpecial Representative will further enhance the\r\ncoordination of the efforts of both the United Nations and\r\nthe OAU, in close consultation with the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of the two Organizations, so as to build upon the\r\ncapabilities of the two Organizations in their joint effort\r\nat preventing and resolving conflicts in Africa.\r\nOne of the major aspirations of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity is the development of a peaceful Africa,\r\nwhich would contribute to the achievement of the broader\r\naspirations for a peaceful world. Africa’s perseverance in\r\nthe pursuit of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building, including post-conflict peace-building, is\r\narticulated by the efforts of the Central Organ of the\r\nOAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\r\nand Resolution and the OAU Conflict Prevention\r\nDivision.\r\nMy delegation is encouraged by the cooperation of\r\nthe United Nations Department of Political Affairs with\r\nthe OAU at various levels and in different ways,\r\nincluding the invitation to the focal point of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) Organ on\r\nPolitics, Defence and Security and also to the OAU\r\nConflict Prevention Division for familiarization visits to\r\nthe Department of Political Affairs. Exchange of\r\ninformation and visits of relevant staff members within\r\nthe Organizations will improve the coordination of the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nimplementation of agreed programmes of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations system and the OAU.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is encouraged by the\r\ncontinuing cooperation between the United Nations system\r\nand funds and programmes in the field of economic and\r\nsocial development. It is common knowledge that, despite\r\na large natural resource base and the adoption of a series of\r\nstructural adjustment programmes, African economies are\r\nstill characterized by low economic growth rates, stemming\r\nmainly from internal and external imbalances, low\r\nproductivity in agriculture, skills shortages and high\r\npopulation growth rates, as well as education and health\r\nproblems. The new transnational threats, in the form of\r\ntransnational networks of crime, drug trafficking, money\r\nlaundering and terrorism, also have a very significant\r\nnegative impact on the already fragile economies of our\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe efforts of the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity to avert these difficulties faced by African\r\ncountries are displayed in the initiatives that have been set\r\nup, such as the United Nations programme of action for\r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development, the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s (UN-NADAF); the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa; and the Tokyo Declaration and\r\nprogramme for action. These initiatives have been launched\r\nover the years because of the deteriorating socio-economic\r\nsituation of the African continent. The implementation\r\napproaches, work programmes and resource mobilization\r\nstrategies that have been established should be closely\r\nfollowed to ensure that the goals for which these initiatives\r\nwere established do not remain merely visionary.\r\nIt will be recalled that, in supporting UN-NADAF and\r\nthe Tokyo Declaration, donor countries committed\r\nthemselves to assist Africa in four main areas: official\r\ndevelopment assistance, external debt alleviation, market\r\naccess and foreign direct investment. The same commitment\r\nhas been made in the various conferences and summits on\r\nissues of development held in the 1990s. However, only a\r\nfew donor countries have lived up to their commitment, and\r\nwe are grateful to them. Otherwise the situation continues\r\nto remain bleak, as official development assistance is on the\r\ndecline and African countries are yet to benefit significantly\r\nfrom the recent international trade expansion and growth in\r\nforeign direct investment. The important question is\r\n“when”? Swaziland and most African countries have\r\ncommitted themselves to the establishment of sound\r\npolitical institutional structures. The approach of adherence\r\nto the principle of accountability has widely increased in\r\nthe continent. All these are a clear indication that the\r\nclimate for trade and investment would be right and\r\nrewarding to foreign entrepreneurs. For these reasons, my\r\ndelegation believes that it is morally correct for developed\r\ncountries to fulfil their obligations.\r\nThe donation by UNDP of $3 million towards\r\ncapacity-building in the OAU Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution will benefit the\r\norganization, as it will strengthen its financial capacity to\r\ncarry out the earmarked projects in this area. Swaziland\r\nis particularly encouraged to note that approximately 10\r\nper cent of the budget of this project will be devoted to\r\nconflict prevention activities involving women. It is to be\r\nborne in mind, though, that the budgetary allocation to\r\nthis important area of activities involving women is far\r\nfrom sufficient, as more than half of the 20 million\r\nrefugees fleeing conflicts in Africa are women and\r\nchildren.\r\nI conclude by reaffirming my Government’s\r\ncommitment to its membership in the United Nations and\r\nthe OAU. Swaziland believes in the importance of the\r\npurposes and goals for which these two bodies were\r\nestablished. Whilst the Security Council has devoted\r\nsubstantial financial and human resources to the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security throughout the world,\r\nthe OAU, for its part, has shown commitment to peace\r\nand security in the region by the establishment of its own\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution.\r\nFurthermore, the Economic and Social Council,\r\nthrough its subsidiary organs, has established numerous\r\nprogrammes aimed at assisting Member States in their\r\ndevelopment efforts. Likewise, the OAU at its thirty-third\r\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government held in\r\nHarare, Zimbabwe, this year adopted a number of\r\nresolutions aimed at the promotion of the economic\r\ngrowth and social development of Africa.\r\nThere is a strong political will on the part of African\r\ncountries to resolve the problems in Africa. What Africa\r\nlacks is the financial strength and human resources. It is\r\nfor this reason that the OAU would rather concentrate its\r\nefforts on preventive action, as it is a less expensive\r\npriority. It is also for this reason that Africa seeks\r\nstrengthened and broadened cooperation with the United\r\nNations, including the enhanced support and assistance of\r\nthe international community.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nMr. Konishi (Japan): The importance of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations,\r\nparticularly in addressing issues of economic development\r\nand conflict prevention, cannot be over-emphasized. Japan\r\nheartily welcomes the emphasis which the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) places on its cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations in these areas, as reflected in the draft\r\nresolution introduced by the representative of Zimbabwe.\r\nAs Japan’s Foreign Minister mentioned in his\r\nstatement at this session of the General Assembly:\r\n“Development and peace are, so to speak, two sides of\r\nthe same coin. Without development, the causes of\r\nconflicts will not be eliminated, and without peace the\r\nconditions for development will not be met.” [Official\r\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fifty-second\r\nSession, Plenary Meetings, 8th meeting, p. 7]\r\nIndeed, underlying many of the regional conflicts we have\r\nwitnessed in recent years are social and economic factors\r\nthat must be addressed in order to achieve and maintain\r\ndurable peace.\r\nIn the recognition that peace and development are\r\ninextricably related, Japan is taking two initiatives which it\r\nhopes will strengthen the cooperative efforts of the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, and particularly the\r\nOAU, in both of these areas.\r\nFirst, this coming January, Japan will convene in\r\nTokyo an International Conference on Strategies for\r\nConflict Prevention, to which it has invited international\r\nexperts as well as representatives of interested Member\r\nStates. In preparing for the conference, Japan intends to\r\nconsult with the OAU as well as with various countries,\r\nespecially those in Africa. We anticipate that the\r\nconference, focusing mainly on the African region, will\r\nproduce concrete proposals as to how to resolve conflicts\r\nthrough cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOAU.\r\nSecondly, the fundamental solution of conflicts in\r\nAfrica requires that development is set firmly on track and\r\nthat poverty is eradicated. Bearing this in mind, Japan has\r\nbeen focusing its efforts on African development issues and\r\nis planning the second Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development (TICAD II), to be convened at the\r\nministerial level next year. The framework of an agenda for\r\naction was worked out at a preparatory meeting held in\r\nTokyo last month.\r\nMany of the issues which the United Nations, and\r\nparticularly the Security Council, is called upon to address\r\nare African problems. Therefore, it was fitting and proper\r\nthat the Council met at the ministerial level in September\r\nto discuss the situation in Africa. We are now looking\r\nforward to the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nsources of conflict in Africa early next year. As a non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council, Japan will\r\ncontinue to work actively in order to contribute to this\r\nprocess. At the same time, Japan is working to foster a\r\ngreater cooperative relationship between the OAU and the\r\ninternational community in the effort to tackle the\r\ncomplex causes of conflicts. Japan is consulting closely\r\nwith the OAU in order to determine how, in addition to\r\nits contributions to the OAU Peace Fund, it can provide\r\nassistance in the areas of development cooperation,\r\nconflict prevention and post-conflict peace-building in\r\nAfrica.\r\nI should like, on behalf of the Government of Japan,\r\nto commend the initiatives and coordinating efforts of the\r\nOAU in the area of conflict prevention, peace-building\r\nand economic development in Africa. We trust that its\r\nevolving cooperative relationship with the United Nations\r\nwill serve as a model for other regional and subregional\r\norganizations as they address the issues of peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): In this brief statement, Argentina would like to\r\nexpress its gratitude to and support for the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) for its efforts over so many\r\nyears to promote peace, democracy and development in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThese efforts are bearing fruit. Most African\r\ncountries are successfully strengthening their democratic\r\ninstitutions, promoting human rights and reforming their\r\neconomies. Through its cooperation machinery, the OAU,\r\nhas been gradually creating the conditions for achieving\r\nthese objectives.\r\nIn the same way, Argentina after decades of political\r\ninstability, legal insecurity and a closed economy, has\r\nmade sacrifices in finding its way back to the path to\r\ndemocracy and is consolidating its political, legal and\r\neconomic institutions. This is why we can well understand\r\nand firmly support the determination of the peoples of\r\nAfrica and their leaders to live in peace in States based\r\non the rule of law.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nArgentina has benefited and is benefiting from the\r\ntrend towards a change in the democratic framework in\r\nAfrica. Not only has Argentina been able to strengthen its\r\nbilateral relations with many countries, it has also bolstered\r\nextremely fruitful trading links.\r\nAlongside these positive developments, some countries\r\nof the continent have suffered political crises. These\r\nsituations have also arisen and exist in other regions and\r\nhave been overcome. The OAU has responded actively and\r\nsupportively, again showing its commitment to finding\r\npeaceful solutions to disputes and defending the rule of law\r\nand its concern at the plight of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons.\r\nWithin the limits of its resources, Argentina has been\r\nworking in and has contributed constructively to\r\npeacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and electoral\r\nmonitoring. It has taken part in peacekeeping operations in\r\nAngola, Mozambique and Western Sahara and, through\r\n“White Helmets” missions or directly, has provided\r\nhumanitarian assistance to various countries of the\r\ncontinent. Argentina also provided electoral observers for\r\nthe first free and universal elections that marked the end of\r\napartheid in South Africa, the referendum on self-\r\ndetermination in Eritrea and the legislative elections in\r\nAlgeria last June.\r\nOn the occasion of the meeting of ministers for\r\nforeign affairs of the States members of the Security\r\nCouncil on 25 September 1997, which was chaired by the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States of America, Mrs.\r\nAlbright, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Di Tella,\r\nreiterated Argentina’s commitment to cooperate actively in\r\nefforts to promote development in Africa. In this\r\nconnection, Argentina has some 70 cooperation programmes\r\nwith Africa currently under way. They cover areas as\r\ndiverse as training in agriculture and cattle-breeding, control\r\nof epidemics, computer science, reform of the State and\r\nprivatization.\r\nIn this auspicious context for cooperation, it is worth\r\nrecalling what the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said on\r\n20 November on the occasion of Africa Industrialization\r\nDay:\r\n“In 1996, for the first time in 20 years, Africa\r\nexperienced growth exceeding 4 per cent. More and\r\nmore countries are experiencing remarkable economic\r\nexpansion. The private sector is beginning to play its\r\nrole in powering the economy. Everywhere, civil\r\nsociety is creating the institutions it needs in order to\r\nbe heard.” [See Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n50th meeting]\r\nTo conclude, we feel that this is a fitting opportunity\r\nfor us to pay tribute to Africa, which forms a very\r\nsignificant component of the United Nations. Without the\r\nAfrican initiative, no changes in areas such as\r\ndecolonization, disarmament, human rights, the\r\nenvironment and development would have been possible.\r\nWe would like to reiterate our support for the aims and\r\npurposes of the OAU, namely those of peace and progress\r\nfor its members.\r\nMr. Mohammed (Ethiopia): May I begin my\r\nstatement by thanking the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the comprehensive report he\r\nhas submitted to the General Assembly in document\r\nA/52/374 on “Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of African Unity”. My Government\r\nhighly appreciates the efforts made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to revitalize cooperation between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nThe end of the 1970s and the 1980s were lost\r\ndecades for Africa. Today, Africa has emerged from the\r\nstagnation of the 1980s, and the 1990s can be described\r\nas the decade of renaissance and hope.\r\nMany African countries have taken far-reaching\r\nmeasures to promote good governance, democratization,\r\npopular participation and political pluralism. Collectively\r\nand individually, they have now grappled with socio-\r\neconomic development challenges by introducing bold\r\neconomic reform measures, which are often painful.\r\nEconomic structures are being strengthened and an\r\nenvironment conducive to private investment has been\r\ncreated. These efforts by African countries require a\r\nsupportive international environment to succeed.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) should be seen in\r\nthis context.\r\nThe United Nations system has a special role in\r\npromoting Africa’s socio-economic development and the\r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts that affect the continent.\r\nIt is encouraging to note, as illustrated in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, that the support of the United Nations\r\nsystem to Africa through various initiatives has increased\r\nover the past year.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nConsultations between the Secretaries-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and the OAU on key African issues over\r\nthe past year, and the steps taken to build closer ties and\r\ncoordination between the two organizations have set the\r\nright direction and momentum for enhanced United\r\nNations-OAU cooperation. The appointment of Ambassador\r\nMohammed Sahnoun as joint United Nations-OAU Special\r\nRepresentative for the Great Lakes region has been a most\r\nwelcome step that further highlighted the new spirit of\r\ncooperation and coordination between the United Nations\r\nand the OAU.\r\nMy delegation notes with appreciation that the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU in\r\nthe areas of peace and security has entered an important\r\nphase. In particular, we are pleased that measures are being\r\ntaken to enhance contacts and exchanges of ideas and\r\ninformation between the Secretariats of the two\r\nOrganizations on critical issues of common concern. The\r\ninvitations that have been extended to subregional\r\nOrganizations, such as the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) and the Intergovernmental Authority\r\non Development (IGAD) are also welcome steps, and such\r\ncontacts with subregional organizations should be\r\nstrengthened and expanded.\r\nOne of the most important areas of coordination and\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU is\r\nthat of enhancing the capacity of the OAU and its\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution to deal with conflict situations in Africa. In this\r\nconnection, my delegation recalls the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on improving preparedness for conflict\r\nprevention and peacekeeping in Africa, document A/50/711,\r\nand the subsequent resolutions of the General Assembly and\r\nrecommendations of the Special Committee on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations. In this regard, my delegation\r\nlooks forward to the Secretary-General’s report to be\r\nsubmitted as requested by the Special Committee on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations at its 1997 session.\r\nWhile the United Nations has the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, regional organizations such as the OAU can also\r\nplay an important role in the prevention, management and\r\nresolution of conflicts in their respective regions. The\r\nsecond meeting of the Chiefs of Defence Staff of Member\r\nStates of the OAU Central Organ, held in October this year\r\nin Harare, Zimbabwe, highlighted this important role of the\r\nOAU, and the need for enhanced cooperation between it\r\nand the United Nations. To this end, my delegation believes\r\nthat greater attention should be given to cooperation\r\nbetween the two Organizations with a view to enhancing\r\nthe OAU’s capacity in conflict prevention, management\r\nand resolution.\r\nIn the economic and social fields, my delegation\r\nnotes with satisfaction the important role that the\r\nEconomic Commission for Africa (ECA) continues to\r\nplay, in cooperation with the OAU and the African\r\nDevelopment Bank (ADB), in particular, in the\r\nestablishment of an African Economic Community\r\n(AEC). The ECA’s cooperation with the OAU in other\r\nimportant fields also demonstrates the indispensable role\r\nand contribution of this regional Economic Commission\r\nin promoting Africa’s economic and social development.\r\nCooperation between the OAU and the various\r\nUnited Nations agencies and programmes, such as the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nWorld Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations\r\nIndustrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World\r\nBank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and others\r\nover the past year has been encouraging. The UNDP has\r\ngiven valuable assistance in support of Africa’s economic\r\nintegration and to strengthen the capacity of the OAU\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution. The UNDP’s assistance for peace efforts in\r\nAfrica and the planned fund-raising campaigns and donor\r\nconferences to increase the financial resources of the\r\nOAU Peace Fund are very commendable.\r\nWhile we commend the encouraging trend in the\r\ncooperation between the OAU and the United Nations\r\nsystem, we wish at the same time to point out that such\r\ncooperation should aim at ensuring the support of the\r\nUnited Nations system and the international community\r\nat large for the implementation of programmes adopted by\r\nAfrican Governments. In this connection, we wish to\r\nhighlight in particular that both the Lagos Plan of Action\r\nand the document “Relaunching Africa’s economic and\r\nsocial development: the Cairo Agenda for Action” remain\r\nvalid as Africa’s long-term development strategy, which\r\nrequires the full support of the United Nations system.\r\nThe challenge facing Africa in the political field is\r\nessentially the achievement of the necessary political\r\nstability for economic integration and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. Needless to say, the establishment of such\r\na conducive environment requires first and foremost\r\ndemocratization, good governance, peace and justice, as\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nwell as the prevention, management and resolution of\r\nconflicts. While achievements by African countries in these\r\nareas have been encouraging in the past few years, the\r\ncontribution of the United Nations system in cooperation\r\nwith the OAU to the efforts of African countries is also\r\nindispensable.\r\nIn the areas of economic cooperation and\r\ndevelopment, the challenges are those highlighted in the\r\nCairo Agenda For Action. However, activities that could be\r\nundertaken through United Nations-OAU cooperation are\r\nexpected to implement various sectoral programmes\r\nconducted within the framework of regional integration to\r\naddress Africa’s external debt problem, food security and\r\nthe restructuring and transformation of the African economy\r\nparallel to current trends in the global economy.\r\nIn the areas of social development and the\r\nenvironment, the United Nations-OAU cooperation should\r\nemphasize capacity-building, as well as the implementation\r\nof the various declarations and strategies adopted by the\r\nOAU Heads of State and Government.\r\nThe Organization of African Unity and the United\r\nNations system constitute indispensable instruments for the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security, and the promotion of\r\nthe economic, social and cultural development of the\r\nAfrican continent. The judicious use of these instruments\r\nthrough cooperation and the concerted rationalization of\r\nactivities could contribute considerably to the\r\nimplementation of development strategies and plans adopted\r\nby the higher organs of the OAU for the benefit of the\r\ncontinent and the attainment of the objectives set out in the\r\nAbuja Treaty establishing the African Economic\r\nCommunity.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to thank the representative of\r\nZimbabwe for introducing, on behalf of the member States\r\nof the OAU, draft resolution A/52/L.8, on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OAU. It is our hope\r\nthat the Assembly will adopt the draft resolution without a\r\nvote.\r\nMr. Rubadiri (Malawi): My delegation associates\r\nitself fully with the remarks made on behalf of the Group\r\nof African States by the delegation of Zimbabwe on this\r\nagenda item, entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity”.\r\nMalawi welcomes the report of the Secretary-General,\r\ncontained in document A/52/374, which gives an outline of\r\nthe activities that have taken place, as well as those that are\r\nscheduled, aimed at strengthening cooperation between\r\nthe two Organizations.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that since the\r\nadoption of resolution 51/151 by the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-first session efforts towards increasing\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) have continued. I\r\nwould therefore like to pay tribute to the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of the two organizations for their commitment to\r\nadvancing collaboration in the various areas.\r\nWe welcome increased consultations and exchange\r\nof information as one way of enhancing the mutual\r\ncapacities of the two Organizations to prevent and resolve\r\nconflicts in Africa and to coordinate efforts in that regard.\r\nThe appointment of Mr. Mohammed Sahnoun as joint\r\nUnited Nations-OAU Special Representative for the Great\r\nLakes region, a mandate which was later expanded to\r\nencompass the Congo, cannot go unnoticed.\r\nThe African continent continues to pursue the issues\r\nof governance, peace and security with determined vigour\r\nand commitment. We are therefore encouraged by the\r\ncontinued participation of the United Nations in Africa’s\r\nefforts towards democratization and peace-building. My\r\ndelegation has taken particular note of the proposed\r\nestablishment by the United Nations Department of\r\nPolitical Affairs of a liaison office at OAU Headquarters\r\nin a continuing effort to strengthen further cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OAU.\r\nMy delegation would further like to recognize the\r\nongoing cooperative efforts by the United Nations,\r\nthrough its various agencies, in the areas of economic and\r\nsocial development. We welcome this and urge the\r\nvarious actors to spare no effort in lending support to the\r\ncontinent as it strives towards economic betterment. The\r\neffective implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-\r\nNADAF) and the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative on Africa will be a step in the right direction.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to second the delegation\r\nof Zimbabwe, which so ably introduced the draft\r\nresolution before us. I should also like to thank the non-\r\nAfrican delegations that have spoken today in favour of\r\nthe draft resolution and, indeed, those who have kept\r\nsilent in order to save time as well. My delegation fully\r\nwelcomes draft resolution A/52/L.8, whose thrust is the\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of African Unity.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nMr. Aass (Norway): The Norwegian Government\r\nwelcomes the Secretary General’s report on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and supports the draft resolution before us.\r\nWe believe that there is a need to strengthen further\r\nthe cooperation and coordination between the United\r\nNations and its various agencies and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity in the fields outlined in the Secretary\r\nGeneral’s report. The United Nations has a special\r\nresponsibility to assist the countries on the African\r\ncontinent, and we therefore also appreciate the initiative\r\ntaken by the Security Council last September to organize a\r\nministerial meeting on the situation in Africa.\r\nWe all know that development and peace are closely\r\ninterconnected, in Africa as everywhere else, and it is a\r\ntragic fact that many parts of Africa in recent years have\r\nbeen the scenes of a number of serious conflicts, with grave\r\nconsequences in terms of both material destruction and\r\nhuman lives.\r\nBecause of the internal nature of many of these\r\nconflicts, the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity have often not been able effectively to intervene\r\nin order to prevent such conflicts from escalating and\r\ndeveloping into major and destructive civil wars, as we\r\nhave seen recently in the case, for example, of the Republic\r\nof the Congo.\r\nThe international community cannot and should not\r\navoid its responsibility in such situations, or limit itself to\r\nassisting with relief to repair the damages and scars caused\r\nby conflicts and wars. We therefore would like to underline\r\nthe importance of enhancing the capacity of the OAU and\r\nother African organizations and institutions to play a more\r\nactive role in preventing, managing and resolving conflicts\r\non the African continent. Only peace arrangements that\r\nhave the support and ownership of the countries and parties\r\nconcerned will prove to be viable and stable.\r\nThe international community, through the United\r\nNations, should at the same time do its utmost to support\r\nand assist the regional efforts in this field, and that is why\r\nit is essential to strengthen the cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OAU.\r\nWe believe that the appointment of a joint United\r\nNations-OAU Special Representative for the Great Lakes\r\nregion is a commendable new initiative in this respect, but\r\nin order to make such joint efforts successful, the necessary\r\nfinancial and administrative resources must be made\r\navailable.\r\nWe also believe in the need to strengthen and\r\ndevelop further the cooperation and coordination between\r\nthe OAU and subregional organizations such as the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC), the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nand the Intergovernmental Authority on Development\r\n(IGAD), especially with regard to conflict prevention and\r\nregional development schemes. Efforts should be made to\r\nensure that there is full coordination between the United\r\nNations and its agencies and these subregional\r\norganizations, and the OAU should play a key role in this\r\nrespect.\r\nThe Norwegian Government believes that experience\r\nhas shown that respect for human rights, democratic\r\ninstitutions and good governance are important and\r\nessential contributions to conflict prevention, to political\r\nstability and to social and economic development. We\r\ngreatly appreciate that this view is today shared by the\r\nmajority of African States and by the African\r\norganizations and institutions. Norway will therefore\r\ncontinue to give the highest priority in its development\r\ncooperation to assist African countries in this field, both\r\nbilaterally and through the United Nations and its\r\nagencies, with the aim of promoting and strengthening the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU and\r\nother regional African organizations.\r\nMr. Amehou (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nSince cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) was\r\ninstitutionalized in 1965, it has steadily evolved. At first\r\nit centred on specific fields of activity. Then it became\r\nmore general, spreading through the two organizations,\r\nthe specialized agencies and other relevant bodies, before\r\nfocusing on the prevention and peaceful settlement of\r\nconflicts, the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, and the management of hot spots in Africa.\r\nThis evolution reflects the dynamism of relations\r\nbetween the two organizations, but more particularly their\r\nability to adapt their joint activities to developments in\r\nthe continent.\r\nThis cooperation, which Bénin welcomes, has\r\nachieved encouraging results in the area of conflict\r\nresolution. These include the return of peace to Liberia in\r\nWest Africa and the progressive normalization of the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nsituation in the Central African Republic and in the Great\r\nLakes region.\r\nThese results have been achieved thanks to the efforts\r\nand goodwill of the parties to the disputes and thanks to the\r\nmany initiatives that the OAU has undertaken with the\r\nsupport of the United Nations.\r\nAs recent developments on the world scene have\r\nshown, achieving the goal of preventing conflicts requires\r\nadopting an integrated approach, which must encompass all\r\nquestions relating to development and the full flowering of\r\nhumankind. These questions — I cite just a few — include\r\nthe restoration of economies ruined by these conflicts, and\r\nhence rehabilitation, reconstruction and development; and\r\nthe establishment of systems for the rapid prevention of\r\nState-level conflicts.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation welcomes the initiatives\r\nundertaken by some countries, including the United States\r\nof America, Great Britain and France, in the area of\r\nstrengthening African peacekeeping capacities.\r\nThe experience of recent years has confirmed that\r\npeace — that is, the absence of conflicts — cannot in and\r\nof itself guarantee a climate of economic and social\r\nprosperity.\r\nIn addition, the measures I have cited must be\r\naccompanied by the successful resolution of other\r\nproblems: debt and debt servicing; economic and social\r\ngrowth; the elimination of poverty; the promotion of\r\nsustainable development; and so on.\r\nThese are the different elements that, among others,\r\nwere the subject of the most recent summit meeting of the\r\nHeads of State or Government of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, which took place in June of this year in\r\nHarare, Zimbabwe. At the Security Council’s special\r\nministerial meeting on the situation in Africa and also\r\nduring the general debate at this General Assembly session,\r\nPresident Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, in his capacity as\r\nPresident of the Organization of African Unity, brilliantly\r\npresented all these different aspects of the question of the\r\ndevelopment of Africa.\r\nThis is the only way that Africa’s development, which\r\nhas been the object of so many initiatives, can finally be\r\nachieved.\r\nMy delegation remains confident that, despite all the\r\napparent obstacles, our collective determination will prevail.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe General Assembly’s consideration of the item on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) provides Member\r\nStates with the opportunity to assess the present state of\r\nthat cooperation and to go more closely into ways of\r\ndeveloping it. Such a review is all the more important\r\nbecause it is taking place at a moment when we are\r\nwitnessing growing interest in the situation in Africa on\r\nthe part of the international community. The holding last\r\n25 September of the Security Council’s special ministerial\r\nmeeting on the situation in Africa was certainly a sign of\r\nthat interest.\r\nThat meeting underlined the importance of the role\r\nof the international community in helping Africa meet the\r\nchallenges it faces. To this end, cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations is essential. In the presidential\r\nstatement adopted during the meeting [S/PRST/1997/46],\r\nthe Council called for a stronger partnership between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OAU in the area of conflict\r\nprevention and the maintenance of peace. My delegation\r\nwelcomes this greater awareness by members of the\r\nSecurity Council, which reflects the need for greater\r\ncooperation between the two organizations in this area.\r\nStrengthening the partnership necessarily calls for the\r\nestablishment of effective mechanisms through which the\r\ntwo organizations can consult and exchange information\r\non a continual and regular basis, and benefit from their\r\nrespective experience.\r\nIn his report to the General Assembly presented in\r\ndocument A/52/374, the Secretary-General took note of\r\nthe various mechanisms that have been established for\r\nstrengthening relations between the two organizations and\r\ncoordinating their work in areas related to security. In that\r\ncontext, my delegation supports the proposal to establish\r\na liaison office within the OAU to facilitate coordination\r\nand the exchange of information between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nOn another level, it is important to emphasize the\r\nneed to strengthen the OAU’s capacity in the area of\r\nconflict prevention and peacekeeping by increasing\r\nassistance to the pan-African organization’s Mechanism\r\nfor Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. In\r\nthat regard we welcome the fact that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral recently sent a technical mission to Addis Ababa\r\nto study how the United Nations could best help the OAU\r\nsecretariat to establish an operations centre so as to\r\nstrengthen the capacity of its unit dealing with questions\r\nrelated to peace on the continent.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nIn that context, it is appropriate to note the growing\r\nrole of subregional organizations in the area of\r\npeacekeeping and conflict prevention in Africa, as well as\r\nthe development of bilateral cooperation as a way of\r\nenhancing the capacities of African States in this area.\r\nThese trends are salutary for two reasons. On the one hand\r\nthey reflect Africans’ desire to organize themselves better\r\nto protect against conflicts and to preserve peace on their\r\ncontinent. On the other hand, they affirm the growing\r\nawareness at the international level of the need to support\r\nthe activities of the African States in this connection. My\r\ndelegation supports all efforts and initiatives that can make\r\nthe work being done to preserve peace on the African\r\ncontinent more effective. We believe that coordination\r\nbetween the Organization of African Unity and the United\r\nNations in this area, together with continuous consultations\r\namong African States, are essential to ensure the success of\r\nthis work. My delegation welcomes the attention given by\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan,\r\nto the situation in Africa. It is apparent in his constant\r\nefforts to strengthen cooperation between the two\r\norganizations, particularly in the area of conflict prevention,\r\nwhich is a key priority in the OAU’s work.\r\nIt has become widely recognized that security and\r\ndevelopment go hand in hand and are interdependent in the\r\nsense that there can be no sustainable security without\r\nsustainable development and vice versa. It is acknowledged\r\nthat the causes of conflicts that break out everywhere in\r\nother parts of the world are often rooted in economic and\r\nsocial problems. In other words, the best way to prevent\r\nconflicts that is to promote development.\r\nDespite some resumption of economic growth in a\r\nnumber of African countries, it remains true that Africa as\r\na whole continues to face multiple constraints that prevent\r\nmany countries of the continent from being able to achieve\r\nsustained economic growth. The major challenge to African\r\ncountries today, in a world characterized by globalization,\r\nis how to become integrated into the world economy and\r\nbecome a viable partner in it.\r\nSuch a perspective will remain a pious wish unless the\r\ninternational community provides the assistance that the\r\nAfrican States need in order to overcome the difficulties\r\nthey face in their attempts to develop. For several years, the\r\nAfrican States have been carrying out economic and\r\npolitical reforms that reflect their eagerness to open\r\nthemselves to the world economy and to adhere to the\r\nglobal principles of democracy and human rights. These\r\nefforts must have the consistent support of the international\r\ncommunity if they are to enjoy continued success.\r\nIn this respect, particular attention should be paid to\r\nthe debt burden that continues to weigh heavily on the\r\nAfrican economies. Efforts must also be made to reverse\r\nthe current trend towards decreased official development\r\nassistance. In this context, cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity is an\r\nessential means of supporting the African States’\r\ndevelopment efforts and of mobilizing Africa’s partners\r\nto that end.\r\nIn his July report on renewing the United Nations,\r\nthe Secretary-General proposed the creation of an office\r\nof development financing to mobilize new and additional\r\nfinancial resources for development projects. We believe\r\nthat this proposal should be studied thoroughly and we\r\nwould emphasize the crucial contribution that donor\r\ncountries can make in mobilizing additional financial\r\nresources.\r\nMoreover, multilateral cooperation and economic\r\nintegration among African States, to which Tunisia\r\nattaches particular importance, are imperative to the\r\npromotion of development in the continent. The United\r\nNations role in cooperating with the OAU is essential to\r\nthat effect. Action in this respect should include the\r\ndrafting of specific programmes aimed at strengthening\r\nregional cooperation in Africa and at facilitating the\r\nattainment of the objectives of the Treaty establishing the\r\nAfrican Economic Community.\r\nIt is clear that any solution to the problems of\r\nAfrican development, both within and outside the\r\nframework of the OAU, must include the establishment of\r\na new partnership between Africa and the international\r\ncommunity. This would require the increased commitment\r\nof the international community to helping the continent\r\nand global measures to respond effectively and adequately\r\nto its needs.\r\nIn this regard, Tunisia reiterates the appeal made by\r\nour President, Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, for a global\r\neconomic plan to ensure Africa’s expansion on a healthy\r\nand lasting basis. This plan should help to strength\r\nAfrica’s own capacities by mobilizing financial resources,\r\nintensifying technical assistance and strengthening\r\nindustrialization through partnership, direct investment,\r\ntrade and the search for a lasting solution to the problem\r\nof debt.\r\nIn conclusion, I would recall that the Security\r\nCouncil, in its presidential statement of last September on\r\nthe situation in Africa, stressed that the challenges facing\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nAfrica require a more global response. To that end, it\r\nrequested the Secretary-General to submit a report\r\ncontaining concrete recommendations to the Council by\r\nFebruary 1998 regarding the sources of conflict in Africa,\r\nways to prevent and address these conflicts, and how to lay\r\nthe foundation for durable peace and economic growth. We\r\nexpress the hope that, when the report is submitted, it will\r\ncontain recommendations that will serve as the starting\r\npoint of a new era of effective cooperation and fruitful\r\npartnership between the international community and\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/52/L.8. I should like to announce\r\nthat, since the introduction of the draft resolution this\r\nmorning, the Netherlands has become a sponsor of the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.8. May I take it that the Assembly\r\ndecides to adopt the draft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.8 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/20).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration\r\nof agenda item 42?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers that, in view of the lateness of the hour, the\r\nconsideration of the last item scheduled for this morning —\r\nagenda item 20 on humanitarian assistance and its sub-\r\nitems (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) — is postponed to this\r\nafternoon.\r\nThe President in the Chair.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: First, I should like to inform Members\r\nthat I have received a letter from the Secretary-General, in\r\nwhich he requests the convening of the High-level Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the\r\nUnited Nations. In this regard, I have already held\r\nextensive consultations and have also requested the\r\nChairmen of the regional groups to inform their respective\r\nmembers about my intention to convene a meeting of the\r\nWorking Group on Tuesday, 25 November 1997, at 3\r\np.m. in the Trusteeship Council Chamber.\r\nOn the subject of agenda item 59, entitled “Question\r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related matters”,\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that, as scheduled,\r\nwe will have a debate on this item on 4 December.\r\nAfter having held intensive consultations, it is my\r\nunderstanding that we will not be taking any decisions on\r\nthe item regarding Security Council issues at this stage of\r\nits consideration. I have received assurances to this effect,\r\nand I am satisfied with these assurances.\r\nIn this connection, I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to inform the Assembly that it is also my\r\nintention to convene a meeting this week of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council to elect its Vice-Chairmen. An\r\nannouncement to this effect will be made in the Journal.\r\nI would like also to draw the Assembly’s attention\r\nto paragraph 7 of General Assembly resolution 40/243,\r\nwhich states,\r\n“no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly may\r\nmeet at United Nations Headquarters during a\r\nregular session of the Assembly unless explicitly\r\nauthorized by the Assembly”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees with\r\nmy proposals — that is, to convene a meeting of the\r\nHigh-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial\r\nSituation of the United Nations tomorrow, and to convene\r\na meeting of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\r\nthe Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council this week, at a\r\ntime to be announced in the Journal?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to announce that the\r\nHigh-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial\r\nSituation of the United Nations will hold its first meeting\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 52nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\ntomorrow at 3 p.m. in the Trusteeship Council Chamber.\r\nThe agenda for that meeting will be as follows: the election\r\nof Vice-Chairmen, a statement by the Secretary-General and\r\na statement by the Under-Secretary-General for\r\nAdministration and Management.\r\nAs far as the meeting on Security Council reform is\r\nconcerned, this will include only the election or nomination\r\nof two Vice-Chairmen.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n18\r\n"
