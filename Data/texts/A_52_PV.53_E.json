(Ukraine)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Kpotsra (Togo),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 20\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including\r\nspecial economic assistance\r\n(a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency\r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\nNotes by the Secretary-General (A/52/270 and\r\nA/52/443)\r\n(b) Special economic assistance to individual countries\r\nor regions\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/52/297,\r\nA/52/341, A/52/433, A/52/434, A/52/500, A/52/525,\r\nA/52/532, A/52/535, A/52/562, A/52/563, A/52/568\r\nand A/52/678)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/52/L.14, L.16, L.34, L.36, L.37)\r\n(d) Assistance to the Palestinian people\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/159)\r\n(e) Participation of volunteers, “White Helmets”, in\r\nactivities of the United Nations in the field of\r\nhumanitarian relief, rehabilitation and technical\r\ncooperation for development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/586)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.32)\r\n(f) Strengthening of international cooperation and\r\ncoordination of efforts to study, mitigate and\r\nminimize the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/537)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.33)\r\nThe Acting President: As announced previously,\r\nsub-item (c) of agenda item 20, entitled “Emergency\r\ninternational assistance for peace, normalcy and\r\nreconstruction of war-stricken Afghanistan”, will be\r\nconsidered together with agenda item 43 at a later date.\r\nI should like to inform the General Assembly that\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, on behalf\r\nof the Group of Western European and Other States, in a\r\nletter dated 10 October 1997, requests that the General\r\nAssembly hear in plenary meeting a statement by the\r\nObserver of Switzerland during the debate on agenda item\r\n20.\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nMembers will recall that in accordance with the\r\nestablished practice of the General Assembly, observer non-\r\nmember States may normally make statements only in the\r\nMain Committees. However, following consultations, it is\r\nproposed that the General Assembly should take a decision\r\non that request.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the proposal\r\nto hear a statement by the Observer of Switzerland in the\r\ncourse of the debate on agenda item 20?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In connection with agenda\r\nitem 20 (b), to date the Assembly has before it five draft\r\nresolutions: A/52/L.14, entitled “Special assistance for the\r\neconomic recovery and reconstruction of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo”; A/52/L.16, entitled “Special\r\neconomic assistance to central African countries receiving\r\nrefugees”; A/52/L.34, entitled “Assistance for the\r\nreconstruction and development of El Salvador”; A/52/L.36,\r\nentitled “Assistance for the reconstruction and development\r\nof Lebanon”; and A/52/37, entitled “Emergency assistance\r\nfor the economic recovery and reconstruction of Burundi”.\r\nIn connection with agenda item 20 (e), the Assembly\r\nhas before it draft resolution A/52/L.32, entitled\r\n“Participation of volunteers, White Helmets\u0027, in activities\r\nof the United Nations in the field of humanitarian relief,\r\nrehabilitation and technical cooperation for development”.\r\nIn connection with agenda item 20 (f), the Assembly\r\nhas before it draft resolution A/52/L.33, entitled\r\n“Strengthening of international cooperation and coordination\r\nof efforts to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences\r\nof the Chernobyl disaster”.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Argentina to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.32.\r\nMr. Frigerio (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): At the outset, my delegation thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the “White Helmets” initiative\r\n[A/52/586]. The report clearly indicates the strength and\r\nquality of the commitment shown by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the unstinting\r\nsupport of the United Nations Volunteers programme. I take\r\nthis opportunity also to pay tribute to the continuous,\r\nintelligent and dedicated cooperation of the Executive\r\nCoordinator of the United Nations Volunteers, Ms. Brenda\r\nGael McSweeney, through whom we hail her colleagues in\r\nBonn, in Geneva and in the many developing countries\r\nwhere national and international “White Helmets”/United\r\nNations Volunteers have been serving the humanitarian\r\ncause.\r\nMy Government also thanks the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, with whose help and support the\r\n“White Helmets” have consolidated and expanded their\r\nefforts.\r\nMy delegation also expresses its special appreciation\r\nto the Governments of France, Germany and Italy for\r\ntheir generous support, which has enabled the initiative to\r\nexpand in the past year in Angola and Haiti. We convey\r\nparticular thanks to Government of Saudi Arabia for its\r\ngenerous contribution that made possible missions in\r\nPalestine, Lebanon and Rwanda.\r\nWe also thank the Governments of Afghanistan,\r\nAngola, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Brazil, Bolivia,\r\nCosta Rica, Chile, Cyprus, Ecuador, El Salvador, Georgia,\r\nGuyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Israel, Kyrgyzstan,\r\nLesotho, Madagascar, Monaco, Morocco, Mozambique,\r\nNicaragua, Panama, Peru, Paraguay, Republic of\r\nMoldova, Romania, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nTurkey and Uruguay, which have joined my country in\r\nsponsoring draft resolution A/52/L.32, which it is my\r\npleasure to introduce to the General Assembly.\r\nAs the Secretary-General notes in his report, the\r\n“White Helmets” initiative is clearly viable in its\r\ntechnical, financial and institutional aspects. This\r\nassessment encourages us to explore new ways to\r\nconsolidate the achievements of the past three years and\r\nto make the most of the potential of the initiative, with\r\nthe cooperation of the agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem and the States participating in the initiative.\r\nThis draft resolution invites Member States to\r\ndevelop and strengthen their respective national volunteer\r\ncorps to support humanitarian relief operations.\r\nCommitment of that kind, of course, requires joint efforts\r\nby Governments and non-governmental organizations and\r\nby civil society at large: the main source of the human\r\nresources that sustain volunteerism.\r\nThe draft resolution further invites the United\r\nNations system to encourage increased participation by\r\nMember States in the decision-making process and in the\r\nimplementation of humanitarian activities. Donor\r\ncountries and specialized agencies must work together and\r\nin a complementary way. Recipient countries too must\r\njoin this dialogue in search of the same outcome: better\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nand more timely aid delivery, with reduced administrative\r\ncosts.\r\nIt is in this broader context that my delegation believes\r\nthe draft resolution must be considered. Volunteerism has\r\na fundamental role to play in strengthening the response\r\ncapacity of the humanitarian system, and can at the same\r\ntime provide Member States with a new quality-control\r\nsystem for humanitarian assistance, avoiding duplicated and\r\noverlapping efforts and contributions. We should create\r\nconditions that will encourage contributions on the basis of\r\na better knowledge of operations and greater involvement\r\nof donor countries at the implementation phase in the field.\r\nForty countries are already involved in this initiative\r\nas donor or recipient countries or through active diplomatic\r\nsupport. Voluntarily and gradually, and in keeping with\r\ntheir respective capacities, Member States can supply the\r\nSecretary-General with one or several lists of teams of\r\n“White Helmet” volunteers slated to act in case of\r\nemergency, at the request either of the Secretary-General or\r\nof the agencies or programmes he designates as\r\nhumanitarian assistance coordinators in a crisis situation.\r\nHere we think it important to consider appointing an officer\r\nto carry out liaison between national “White Helmet” focal\r\npoints and the United Nations system.\r\nThe national humanitarian assistance “White Helmets”\r\nteams could be assigned by Member States or the\r\nSecretary-General to act in specific geographical areas or in\r\nspecific emergencies, in a manner consistent with the\r\napproach of the contributing State and the various United\r\nNations programmes. We would thus create a means of\r\nbringing together donors and recipients and ensuring prompt\r\nand efficient implementation of programmes, a mechanism\r\npermitting a better identification of the end use of the\r\ncontributions. The institutions and programmes of the\r\nsystem would have more realistic data regarding the cost\r\nand availability of human resources for project\r\nimplementation.\r\nThis scheme, together with several Argentine missions,\r\nhas allowed for the successful participation of volunteers\r\nand “White Helmets” experts in the Middle East, Africa,\r\nCentral America, Latin America and Central Asia, covering\r\nsuch needs as drinking water, monitoring of elections,\r\nassistance to displaced groups, provision of medical and\r\nfood assistance and carrying out mine-clearance operations.\r\nOf course, I would not wish to miss this opportunity\r\nto renew the invitation for new financial contributions to\r\nthe “White Helmets” initiative, either through the United\r\nNations Volunteers special window or through other trust\r\nfunds. A higher level of contributions would allow for\r\neven further progress in broadening the initiative\u0027s\r\ninternational scope to cover other areas of the world and\r\nother humanitarian tasks.\r\nWe also think that this draft resolution makes it\r\npossible for the United Nations system and Member\r\nStates to address the question of new sources of\r\nfinancing. In this respect, I am pleased to confirm that our\r\nGovernment will be contributing in the next few days an\r\nadditional $1 million to the “White Helmets” special\r\nwindow.\r\nGiven the commitment we have all made, I hardly\r\nneed to appeal for redoubled solidarity efforts.\r\nNonetheless, I think this is a useful opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate our conviction that not only can we show\r\nsolidarity but also that we can be more efficient and more\r\nparticipatory, by encouraging and facilitating, through\r\nsupport for volunteer service, a greater involvement of\r\ncivil society in the difficult task ahead.\r\nIn this respect, we welcome the Assembly\u0027s adoption\r\nof the resolution declaring 2001 as the International Year\r\nof Volunteers, which recognizes the significant\r\ncontribution made by volunteers to the well-being and full\r\nrealization of the aspirations to improve citizens\u0027 living\r\nconditions, with peace, development and human rights.\r\nThe “White Helmets”, just like the “Blue Helmets”\r\nin the maintenance of peace and security, can give the\r\nOrganization an effective multilateral tool to combat the\r\nscourges of violence, hunger, poverty and injustice.\r\nThe Acting President: Before calling on the next\r\nspeaker, I should like to propose that the list of speakers\r\nin the debate on this item be closed at 4 p.m. this\r\nafternoon.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I therefore request those\r\nrepresentatives wishing to participate in the debate on this\r\nitem to inscribe their names as soon as possible.\r\nI now call on the representative of Ukraine to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.33.\r\nMr. Parashin (Ukraine) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Ukraine on agenda item 20 (f),\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\n“Strengthening of international cooperation and coordination\r\nof efforts to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences\r\nof the Chernobyl disaster”.\r\nI am happy that, as the director of the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant, I have been given a rare opportunity\r\nto participate in this session of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich is of historic significance, and to discuss an issue of\r\ncrucial importance to Ukraine — and not only to us, but to\r\nothers as well.\r\nMore than 11 years have passed since the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant disaster, but the problems generated\r\nhave unfortunately not diminished. Its ecological and\r\neconomic effects have been aggravated by socio-\r\npsychological consequences.\r\nDealing with the consequences has become a very\r\nheavy burden for Ukraine. By allocating 6 per cent of our\r\nState budget to heal the wound of Chernobyl, Ukraine has\r\nlost the opportunity to finance many other vitally important\r\nprogrammes for building an independent State, at a time\r\nwhen it is undergoing profound economic reforms.\r\nUkraine has agreed to decommission the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant by the year 2000. This involves major\r\nmeasures which my country, unfortunately, does not have\r\nsufficient experience to carry out, and, more important,\r\ndoes not have the funds to carry out. Preparing to close the\r\nplant, with international cooperation, is only the initial\r\nphase of decommissioning it. It is also a serious social\r\nproblem for the 6,000 personnel who have managed to\r\nsecure the plant’s safe operation during the 11 years since\r\nthe accident occurred. In addition, the town of Slavutich,\r\nwhere the power plant personnel and their families live, has\r\na population of 26,000 without support, and unemployment\r\nthere is expected to reach 17 per cent by 1998.\r\nA memorandum of understanding was signed on 20\r\nDecember 1995 in Ottawa between the Government of\r\nUkraine, the Governments of the G-7 nations and the\r\nEuropean Union on closing the nuclear power plant. This\r\noffers real opportunities for cooperation in dealing with the\r\nChernobyl problem.\r\nUkraine shut down power unit 1 in 1996, ahead of\r\nschedule, thereby demonstrating its genuine intention to\r\nfulfil its commitments under the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding. However, the global dimension of the task\r\nand the current economic crisis mean that Ukraine alone\r\ncannot carry the huge expense of solving the Chernobyl\r\nproblem. A few days ago, on 20 November, a very\r\nimportant Chernobyl Shelter Pledging Conference on\r\nraising funds for a workers’ shelter project was co-chaired\r\nby Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and United States\r\nVice President Albert Gore here in New York. This\r\nConference proves yet again how serious the Chernobyl\r\nproblem remains and the importance that countries attach\r\nto its solution.\r\nContributions were made during the Conference, and\r\nthis means that very soon we can begin making a secure\r\ncover over this sleeping threat to global ecology, health\r\nand life itself. On behalf of the Ukrainian Government, I\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to express gratitude to\r\nall those who took part in that Conference.\r\nWe cannot forget that it is impossible to solve the\r\nChernobyl problem just by decommissioning the power\r\nplant. The United Nations inter-agency needs assessment\r\nmission which travelled to affected regions of Belarus, the\r\nRussian Federation and Ukraine last May reconfirmed the\r\ncomplexity of the problem. Having evaluated the situation\r\nin all three countries, it stressed the need for further\r\nsubstantial assistance in the areas of public health, socio-\r\npsychological rehabilitation, the environment, socio-\r\neconomic issues and information. There is also a need to\r\nfinance power capacity to offset Ukraine’s losses resulting\r\nfrom decommissioning the Chernobyl nuclear power\r\nplant. In addition, there is the question of removing 200\r\ntons of fuel-containing mass from the sarcophagus,\r\nbecause it is a serious ecological threat. As I have said,\r\nthere is also the issue of social protection for the reduced\r\npersonnel of the plant and the people of Slavutich,\r\nUkraine’s youngest city, where there is a concentration of\r\nmajor intellectual potential.\r\nChernobyl cannot be regarded as the problem of just\r\none country or group of countries. This unprecedented\r\ntechnological catastrophe was man-made, but it remains\r\na common human tragedy on a global scale. It continues\r\nto represent a serious problem not only for Ukraine and\r\nother affected countries, but for the international\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nWe are deeply convinced that dealing with the\r\naftermath of the disaster and resolving the whole\r\nspectrum of problems involved can be accomplished only\r\nthrough the joint effort of the entire international\r\ncommunity. Multilateral cooperation combining the\r\nintellectual and financial input of international\r\norganizations, international financial institutions and\r\nscientific and charitable funds is necessary to mitigate and\r\nminimize the consequences of the disaster. In this\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nconnection, I should like once again to express our great\r\nappreciation for the humanitarian efforts made by the\r\norganizations of the United Nations system in mitigating the\r\nafter-effects of the disaster.\r\nEleven years have passed, but Chernobyl continues to\r\nchallenge our technical, scientific and humanitarian\r\nthinking. The way in which the world community deals\r\nwith this problem will show civilization’s readiness to deal\r\nwith tragedies on a global scale.\r\nAll nations share a common destiny. Present and\r\nfuture generations are truly striving to live in an\r\necologically safe environment, and we call upon all\r\ncountries, international organizations and financial\r\ninstitutions to unite their efforts in implementing the\r\nprogramme to eliminate the severe consequences of\r\nChernobyl and to prevent similar disasters.\r\nAs the Secretary-General emphasized in his report,\r\nimplementation of the programme would translate into\r\npositive action the resolve and commitment expressed in\r\nmany United Nations resolutions on Chernobyl which,\r\nregrettably, remain largely unfulfilled.\r\nOn behalf of the delegations of Belarus, Japan, the\r\nRussian Federation and Ukraine, I have the honour to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.33, entitled “Strengthening\r\nof international cooperation and coordination of efforts to\r\nstudy, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster”. This document expresses concern\r\nabout the long-term nature of the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl nuclear-power-plant disaster, which was a major\r\ntechnological catastrophe, and about the ongoing effects on\r\nthe lives and health of people, in particular children, in the\r\naffected areas of Belarus, the Russian Federation and\r\nUkraine.\r\nThe draft resolution takes into consideration the results\r\nof the United Nations needs-assessment mission to the\r\naffected areas in May this year, as well as the conclusions\r\nand recommendations of the United Nations-sponsored\r\nseminar, “Chernobyl and beyond: humanitarian assistance\r\nto victims of technological disasters”, which was held in\r\nMoscow, also in May this year.\r\nThe draft resolution also requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to continue his efforts in implementing the relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions by using existing\r\ncoordination mechanisms, in particular the United Nations\r\nCoordinator of International Cooperation on Chernobyl.\r\nThe draft resolution invites donor States, relevant\r\nfinancial institutions and other concerned parties of the\r\ninternational community, including non-governmental\r\norganizations, to continue to provide support to the efforts\r\nmade by Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine to\r\nmitigate the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Our\r\ndocument also welcomes the decision of the Heads of\r\nState and Government of the seven major industrial\r\ncountries and the European Community, adopted at\r\nDenver in June 1997, regarding assistance in securing the\r\nenvironmental safety of the sarcophagus, and also\r\nwelcomes the preparation of the inter-agency programme\r\nof international assistance to areas affected by the\r\nChernobyl disaster. In addition, our draft resolution\r\nwelcomes the convening by the United Nations of a\r\nspecial international meeting on Chernobyl to be held\r\ntomorrow, 25 November 1997, to generate further support\r\nfor the populations of Belarus, the Russian Federation and\r\nUkraine.\r\nThe draft resolution calls upon the United Nations\r\nCoordinator of International Cooperation on Chernobyl to\r\ncontinue his efforts to deal with the health, social,\r\neconomic and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster in the most seriously affected areas of Belarus,\r\nthe Russian Federation and Ukraine on the basis of the\r\ninter-agency programme of international assistance to\r\nthese areas.\r\nWe should like to express our gratitude to those\r\ndelegations that have sponsored the draft resolution and\r\nto those that participated constructively in drafting it. We\r\nappeal to all delegations to support our draft resolution;\r\ntheir support is very important to us.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to touch upon another\r\nimportant issue of great concern to my Government: the\r\nquestion of special economic assistance to countries\r\nwhose economies have been affected by the negative\r\neffects of sanctions imposed by the Security Council on\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine believes that this issue\r\nshould remain on the agenda of the United Nations, as\r\nearlier resolutions on the issue have not been properly\r\nimplemented — at least with respect to our country,\r\nwhich has not received any practical assistance to\r\ncompensate for our enormous losses resulting from our\r\nconsistent compliance with the sanctions regime. Let me\r\nremind the Assembly once again that Ukraine’s losses\r\namounted to some $5 billion, so we cannot agree with the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nview that, once the sanctions were lifted, there was no point\r\nin further considering the issue.\r\nThe crucial importance of this problem was confirmed\r\nlast week in the Sixth Committee, which adopted by\r\nconsensus a draft resolution entitled “Implementation of the\r\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to\r\nassistance to third States affected by the application of\r\nsanctions”.\r\nOur delegation intends to introduce to the Assembly\r\na draft resolution under agenda item 20 (b), on economic\r\nassistance to States affected by the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions imposing sanctions on the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia.\r\nWe sincerely hope for the understanding and the\r\nsupport of the Assembly.\r\nMr. Wolzfeld (Luxembourg) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union on the question of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe following countries of Central and Eastern Europe\r\nassociated with the European Union join in support of this\r\nstatement: Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the\r\nCzech Republic, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, as does\r\nthe associated country of Cyprus.\r\nHumanitarian assistance is a priority commitment of\r\nthe European Union. In this connection, we attach particular\r\nimportance to the coordination of such assistance within the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nThe coordination of humanitarian assistance within the\r\nUnited Nations system has this year been marked by a\r\nconcerted effort on the part of the Secretary-General to\r\nreallocate responsibilities for humanitarian activities. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome the establishment of the new Office\r\nof the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the adoption by\r\nthe General Assembly on 12 November of resolution 52/12,\r\nentitled “Renewing the United Nations: a programme for\r\nreform”. The operational activities that were formerly the\r\nresponsibility of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs,\r\nhave been reallocated to other departments within the\r\nSecretariat and to operational agencies within the system.\r\nThe secondment of humanitarian personnel from other\r\norganizations in the United Nations system, as well as\r\ncooperation and coordination between the different\r\nagencies, will play a decisive role in achieving the aims of\r\nthe Office. It is therefore essential to reinforce the role of\r\nthe Inter-Agency Standing Committee under the\r\nchairmanship of the Emergency Relief Coordinator if\r\nconsistency in policy both at Headquarters and on the\r\nground is to be guaranteed. The viability — indeed, the\r\nsuccess — of the new arrangements will depend upon the\r\nlogical distribution of tasks, on a clear assumption of\r\nresponsibility and, finally, on a division of labour between\r\nGeneva and New York that respects the particular\r\nqualities of each of those host cities.\r\nThe European Union believes that the principles set\r\nout in General Assembly resolution 46/182 will enable the\r\nnew Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator to take\r\non the crucial tasks of coordinating relief efforts on the\r\nground, organizing public relations activities to attract\r\npotential donors and liaising with the United Nations\r\napparatus for maintaining peace. We welcome, in this\r\ncontext, the appointment of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello to\r\nthe post of Emergency Relief Coordinator. The European\r\nUnion will offer him its full support. It is our view that\r\nthe basic services of the Emergency Relief Coordinator’s\r\nOffice should be financed from the United Nations\r\nregular budget.\r\nIn the effort to strengthen coordination, more\r\nattention should be paid to the role of implementing\r\npartners entrusted with carrying out many activities and\r\nto their relationship with the humanitarian agencies in\r\norder to enhance efficiency, accountability and monitoring\r\nof the results of humanitarian assistance. An analysis of\r\nthis matter is contained in the report of the Joint\r\nInspection Unit.\r\nThe European Union will follow with interest the\r\nestablishment in the coming months of the Office of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator. We also attach particular\r\nimportance to an appropriate follow-up to the reforms in\r\nhumanitarian assistance in the light of the debate that will\r\ntake place in the Economic and Social Council as\r\nprovided for in the Council’s resolution 1995/56.\r\nOne aspect of humanitarian assistance — the safety\r\nof humanitarian aid workers — is unfortunately,\r\nbecoming a burning issue. The European Union will\r\nsubmit to the General Assembly a draft resolution on the\r\nsafety of humanitarian workers that reflects our deep\r\nconcern at situations throughout the world where the\r\nsafety of such workers is threatened.\r\nThe reasons for this state of affairs are many and\r\ncomplex. The general anarchy that reigns in many of\r\ntoday’s crisis situations is certainly a factor. But of even\r\ngreater concern is the evidence that aid workers are more\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nand more being deliberately targeted. This highlights some\r\nof the realities now facing humanitarian aid projects. In the\r\npast, humanitarian principles and the impartiality of\r\nhumanitarian action were respected by both sides in a\r\nconflict, but these no longer provide adequate guarantees\r\nfor the security of humanitarian workers. Too often, it has\r\nbecome difficult, or even impossible for agencies and non-\r\ngovernmental humanitarian organizations to reach people\r\naffected by an armed conflict or the victims of other\r\nemergencies. We are all aware that it is civilian populations\r\nand refugees who suffer most in such situations.\r\nHumanitarian assistance is directly affected by the\r\npolitical environment in which it is carried out. At the same\r\ntime, humanitarian action can have a positive effect on such\r\nan environment. Apart from providing emergency relief in\r\na humanitarian crisis, such action also helps reintegrate\r\nrefugees and ex-combatants into civilian life, and this is\r\noften a crucial first step in stabilizing the situation and\r\nclearing the way for sustainable development in a country\r\nin crisis.\r\nThe question of access to people suffering hardships\r\nis of vital importance. The draft resolution thus appeals to\r\nGovernments and parties involved in armed conflicts or\r\nother emergency situations to guarantee aid workers\r\nunrestricted access to the affected populations and to take\r\nall necessary steps to ensure that humanitarian activity can\r\ntake place in an environment of safety. It also calls on\r\nStates to hold to account anyone guilty of acts of violence\r\ntowards aid workers. Finally, the draft resolution pays\r\ntribute to those who have given their lives while trying to\r\nhelp people in distress and salutes the courage of aid\r\nworkers who continue to fulfil their mission, often in\r\nextremely dangerous circumstances.\r\nIn conclusion, the European Union remains acutely\r\naware of the difficulties caused by natural disasters and\r\ncomplex emergencies, including the adverse impact that\r\nsuch crises can have on neighbouring States in the affected\r\nregion. In this context, the European Union has offered\r\nsubstantial assistance to neighbouring countries in order to\r\ncounteract the adverse economic impact of sanctions\r\nimposed against the former Yugoslavia. Although economic\r\nproblems still remain in these countries, the European\r\nUnion is pleased to note a marked improvement in the\r\nsituation. The European Union remains, however, deeply\r\nconcerned about serious humanitarian crises that persist in\r\nother regions. We shall, in the future, continue to help those\r\ncountries as much as possible in their efforts to overcome\r\ntheir economic difficulties.\r\nMr. Konishi (Japan): Japan has long emphasized the\r\nimportance of responding to humanitarian crises and\r\ndisasters effectively and in a coordinated manner, and it\r\nhas done so in a number of international forums. The\r\nissue of humanitarian assistance was discussed at the last\r\nsubstantive session of the Economic and Social Council,\r\non the basis of the report of the Secretary-General. In this\r\ncontext, Japan appreciates the initiatives of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, endorsed on 12 November by the General\r\nAssembly, to further strengthen the United Nations\r\ncapacity for launching coherent and coordinated\r\nhumanitarian actions under the guiding principles of\r\nhumanity, neutrality and impartiality.\r\nMy delegation wishes to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress its sincere gratitude to Mr. Yasushi Akashi,\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and\r\nalso Emergency Relief Coordinator at the same time, for\r\nfulfilling so ably the difficult mandate entrusted to him\r\nand with such limited resources. His achievements in the\r\ncourse of his long years of service at the United Nations\r\ndeserve our great admiration and deep respect. I believe\r\nthat his career should serve as a model for present and\r\nfuture United Nations staff members.\r\nI would also like to express my congratulations to\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello on his appointment to the\r\nnew post of Emergency Relief Coordinator and to wish\r\nhim great success in his future work. Japan is ready to\r\nextend its full support to him in discharging his important\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nIn carrying out his responsibilities, the new\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator is expected to focus on\r\nthree core functions, namely, policy development and\r\ncoordination functions in support of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, advocacy of humanitarian issues with political\r\norgans and coordination of the humanitarian emergency\r\nresponse to crises. As Japan has long advocated that the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its\r\nfunction as a strategic centre for coordination and that it\r\nrefrain from becoming involved in the operational field of\r\nhumanitarian activities, it welcomes such an orientation,\r\nand is confident that, with its new and streamlined\r\nfunctions, the Office of the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator, together with the strengthened Inter-Agency\r\nStanding Committee (IASC), will contribute to an\r\neffective response to humanitarian crises. Furthermore,\r\nJapan hopes that the proposed steering committee of the\r\nIASC, which will consist of six members from the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP), the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and a representative\r\nof non-governmental agencies, will contribute to increasing\r\nthe speed of that response.\r\nThe new Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator\r\nwill commence operation at the beginning of next year, and\r\nit is important that it be structured and organized in such a\r\nmanner as to ensure optimum implementation of the core\r\nfunctions. In this connection, my delegation wishes to make\r\ntwo comments.\r\nFirst, Japan feels great concern over the fact that,\r\naccording to the revised budget, the Office of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator continues to depend largely\r\non extrabudgetary personnel to carry out many of its\r\nfunctions, as did the Department of Humanitarian Affairs.\r\nHowever, inasmuch as the Office of the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator is a part of the United Nations Secretariat,\r\nfurther efforts should be made so that its core functions are\r\nfinanced through assessed contributions. To that end, the\r\nproportion of the staff funded by the regular budget should\r\nbe gradually increased and dependence on extrabudgetary\r\ncontributions reduced.\r\nSecondly, I wish to refer to the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator’s Offices in New York and in Geneva. The\r\nnew Office will be relatively small in size and focused on\r\nits core activities. Considering the importance of a political\r\ninterface with the Security Council, the General Assembly,\r\nthe Department of Political Affairs and the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations, Japan supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s plan with regard to the Office of the Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator in New York. However, since the\r\nheadquarters of major humanitarian organizations, which\r\nhave direct links with field operations, are located in\r\nGeneva, Japan hopes that consideration will be given to the\r\nimportance of the Office in Geneva when the new structure\r\nis finalized.\r\nI would like to reiterate the need to address the issue\r\nof a smooth transition from emergency relief to\r\nrehabilitation and development. In this connection, the\r\nbriefing given by Mr. Akashi in the Second Committee last\r\nThursday on humanitarian crises and development was very\r\ninformative and helpful. As he emphasized, planning for\r\ndevelopment should start at an early stage so that it will be\r\nsustainable, while humanitarian assistance agencies work at\r\nthe same time to implement programmes that will help\r\nstimulate rehabilitation and development. To this end, a\r\nmechanism should be established for effecting close\r\ncooperation between humanitarian organizations and\r\ndevelopment agencies, so that the efforts of both may\r\nproceed in a coordinated and complementary manner.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to touch upon one\r\nvery important issue concerning humanitarian assistance.\r\nDuring the debate in the Third Committee earlier this\r\nmonth, serious concern was expressed by the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and many\r\ndelegations over the attacks and threats that have been\r\nlevelled at humanitarian personnel, including those from\r\nUnited Nations organizations. It is of the utmost\r\nimportance that the international community act to protect\r\nhumanitarian personnel, and Japan, on many occasions,\r\nhas urged that this be done. Discussions earlier this year\r\nin the Security Council on the question of their safety, in\r\nwhich Japan was an active participant, produced two\r\npresidential statements: one on the security of United\r\nNations operations, which was adopted on 12 March, and\r\nthe other on protection for humanitarian assistance to\r\nrefugees and others in conflict situations, which was\r\nadopted on 19 June. Japan is pleased to join the initiative\r\nof the European Union in calling for the international\r\ncommunity to address the issue of the safety of\r\nhumanitarian personnel. In this context, I would like to\r\ndraw the attention of the Assembly to the Convention on\r\nthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel,\r\nwhich was adopted by the General Assembly on 9\r\nDecember 1994 but, to our regret, has not yet come into\r\nforce. Japan appeals to all countries that have not yet\r\ndone so to become parties to this important agreement so\r\nthat it will come into force without further delay. I hasten\r\nto add, however, that the adoption of a legal instrument\r\nin itself will not solve our problems. Japan continues to\r\nspeak out on this issue and it will cooperate closely with\r\nall Member States in pursuing ways and means of\r\nimproving the present situation.\r\nMr. Aass (Norway): Norway warmly welcomes the\r\nappointment of Sergio Vieira de Mello as Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator, and we pledge our full support for\r\nhim in his important new function.\r\nAt the same time we would like to express our\r\nappreciation for the work and dedication of Under-\r\nSecretary-General Yasushi Akashi in heading the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs. Norway has strongly\r\nsupported the Secretary-General’s overall reform proposal\r\nand welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly of\r\nresolution 52/12, on “Renewing the United Nations: a\r\nprogramme for reform”, by consensus.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nWe look forward to the implementation of the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiatives pertaining to the field of\r\nhumanitarian advocacy and coordination. The reform\r\nproposals requiring intergovernmental decisions should be\r\ndealt with in the near future, including within the\r\nframework of the follow-up of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil resolution 1995/56.\r\nNorway would like to highlight some elements in the\r\nhumanitarian reform programme which we find to be of\r\nparticular importance.\r\nFirst, the authority of the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator, in his capacity as Humanitarian Coordinator,\r\nmust be recognized and respected within the entire United\r\nNations system. We are now entering the stage of system-\r\nwide implementation of agreed conclusions and\r\nrecommendations.\r\nSecondly, the Office of the Coordinator has been\r\ngiven a renewed opportunity to focus on its core mandate\r\nand functions. In this context, we welcome the decision to\r\nrelieve the Office of all operational activities and allocate\r\nthese to more appropriate parts of the system.\r\nThirdly, strong coordination between the Executive\r\nCommittee on Humanitarian Affairs and the Inter-Agency\r\nStanding Committee is crucial. Consequently, the\r\nestablishment of a joint secretariat is appropriate. Likewise,\r\nthe secondment of staff to the Coordinator’s Office from\r\nrelevant parts of the United Nations system in order to\r\nensure unified approaches to crisis management deserves\r\nour full support.\r\nFourthly, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs\r\nsuffered from a chronic lack of sufficient funding. We\r\nstrongly endorse the objective of including the activities of\r\nthe Office of the Coordinator in the regular budget of the\r\nUnited Nations. Transitional voluntary funding must be the\r\nexception, not the rule.\r\nA fifth point is that United Nations humanitarian\r\nactivities are not sufficiently monitored and reviewed by\r\nMember States. We support the proposal to enhance the\r\nrole of the Economic and Social Council in this respect and\r\nlook forward to discussions about possible new monitoring\r\nmechanisms to be developed in a longer-term perspective.\r\nThe right to receive and to deliver humanitarian\r\nassistance is essential in international humanitarian law.\r\nThis is the fundamental basis for discussions about the\r\nsecurity of humanitarian personnel. We welcome and\r\nsupport the European Union initiative to focus on this\r\nparticular problem under this agenda item. The\r\ninternational community should never accept that parties\r\nto a conflict interrupt humanitarian operations through\r\ncriminal acts directed against humanitarian personnel.\r\nJoint efforts to eliminate such a flagrant violation of all\r\nhumanitarian principles are urgently called for.\r\nMr. Yuan Shaofu (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): The Chinese delegation would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the series of reports that he\r\nsubmitted to this session of the General Assembly in\r\nconnection with agenda item 20, entitled “Strengthening\r\nof the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief\r\nassistance of the United Nations, including special\r\neconomic assistance”, and wishes to take this opportunity\r\nto state its views on some relevant aspects of this item.\r\nThe Chinese delegation has always shown great\r\ninterest in emergency humanitarian relief activities, and\r\nattaches great importance to the role played by the United\r\nNations in this field. On the basis of the progress in the\r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolution 46/182\r\nover the past six years and of an assessment of the\r\nactivities of the United Nations in the humanitarian field,\r\nthe Secretary-General, in his report on United Nations\r\nreform in document A/51/950, proposed certain actions\r\nand made some recommendations with regard to reform\r\nin the area of humanitarian affairs.\r\nThe Chinese delegation supports reform measures\r\nsuch as the establishment of an Office of the Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator to be headed by an Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral, as well as the strengthening of the Inter-Agency\r\nStanding Committee (IASC) and the consolidated appeal\r\nprocess. The Chinese delegation believes that such reform\r\nwill enable the United Nations system to further the\r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolution 46/182,\r\nand to take concerted, expeditious and effective\r\nhumanitarian action in response to natural disasters and\r\nemergencies, in accordance with the guiding principles of\r\nhumanity, neutrality and impartiality, bringing into full\r\nplay the overall strengths of the United Nations in this\r\nfield.\r\nThe Chinese delegation is of the view that the\r\nnewly-established Emergency Relief Coordinator should\r\nfocus more on three core functions — namely, policy\r\nformulation and coordination, the advocacy of\r\nhumanitarian issues and the coordination of humanitarian\r\nemergency responses — in order to do a better job of\r\nimplementing General Assembly resolution 46/182.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nFollowing the dissolution of the Department of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, its former responsibilities should be\r\nredistributed within the United Nations system in such a\r\nway as to ensure the continued provision of effective\r\nhumanitarian assistance to disaster-stricken developing\r\ncountries, to help them to carry out their post-disaster\r\nreconstruction and resume their economic development, and\r\nto enhance capacity-building in developing countries for\r\ndisaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness in a truly\r\neffective manner, so as to minimize the damages caused by\r\nvarious kinds of disasters.\r\nAdequate resources are a prerequisite for providing\r\nhumanitarian assistance to developing countries and\r\nassisting in their recovery and development. Since the\r\nadoption of General Assembly resolution 46/182, 68 United\r\nNations inter-agency consolidated appeals have been made,\r\nresulting in a total of $10.4 billion to be used for assistance\r\nagainst various kinds of disasters. But this amount is far\r\nshort of meeting the increasing needs of disaster-stricken\r\ncountries for humanitarian assistance as a result of frequent\r\nnatural and man-made disasters occurring all over the\r\nworld. The Chinese delegation holds the view that\r\ndevelopment funds for disaster prevention and mitigation\r\nand for post-disaster reconstruction should not be provided\r\nfrom the limited development resources of other funds and\r\nprogrammes; instead, new sources of funding should be\r\nfound in order to establish a special fund. Developed\r\ncountries should make a commitment to contribute to such\r\na fund, for without that the Secretary-General’s reform\r\nwould just be putting old wine in a new bottle, and the\r\nreform would lose its meaning.\r\nMr. Dimitrov (Bulgaria) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the delegation of Bulgaria, I would like to\r\nraise the question of economic assistance for countries\r\naffected by the Security Council resolutions imposing\r\nsanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\r\nI take this opportunity to extend our thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for the understanding he has shown and\r\nhis energetic efforts he has made to find an adequate\r\nresponse to the serious problems that have accumulated\r\nover the past few years. The form and content of his report,\r\ncontained in document A/52/535, allow us to structure our\r\ndebates in a better way.\r\nThe question of the political consequences of the\r\nsanctions adopted by the Security Council is extremely\r\nimportant for Bulgaria, which has suffered great losses\r\nsince the start of the commercial and economic embargo\r\nagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The following\r\nfigures are indicative of the extent of the losses. Before\r\nthe imposition of sanctions, 75 per cent of Bulgarian\r\nexports passed through the territory of our neighbour,\r\nwhich was also one of our main trading partners. For an\r\neconomy such as Bulgaria’s, 80 per cent of whose\r\nproducts are intended for foreign markets, such sanctions\r\nwere extremely burdensome. We were practically cut off\r\nfrom the European markets, and a heavy blow was dealt\r\nto a number of industrial sectors traditionally linked to\r\nthat region; as a result, the economic and financial\r\nsituation of the country has been weakened. These\r\nnegative effects were added to the difficulties already\r\nbeing encountered with the transition to a market\r\neconomy. When the losses caused by observance of the\r\nsanctions against Iraq and Libya are added, the amount of\r\ndirect and indirect losses is close to that of Bulgaria’s\r\nexternal debt. Expert estimates based on a methodology\r\nproposed by the United Nations Development Programme\r\nmission place that amount at approximately $8 billion.\r\nUnfortunately, even today, when the peace process\r\nhas started and sanctions are being lifted, their effects are\r\nstill felt on the socio-economic situation of Bulgaria and\r\nother affected countries.\r\nIn strictly observing the collective measures imposed\r\nby the United Nations, Bulgaria was counting on an\r\nequitable distribution of the economic burden within the\r\ninternational community. Bulgaria believes that the\r\ninternational community should demonstrate its political\r\nwill and establish an effective mechanism for overcoming\r\nthe losses endured by countries who have strictly\r\ncomplied with the United Nations resolutions.\r\nOver the course of its last four sessions, the United\r\nNations General Assembly has adopted resolutions on\r\ngranting economic assistance to countries affected by the\r\ncommercial and economic embargo against the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. Those resolutions, in Bulgaria’s\r\nview, attest to the international community’s\r\nunderstanding of the problems facing the countries so\r\naffected. Unfortunately, the effect of the implementation\r\nof those resolutions is far from meeting our expectations\r\nand hopes of providing any adequate technological,\r\nfinancial and material assistance to compensate for the\r\nlosses sustained. There have still been no positive changes\r\nwith regard to the adoption of measures to create wider\r\nopportunities for participation in the post-conflict\r\nreconstruction and development of the former Yugoslavia.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to address\r\ninternational financial institutions, international\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\norganizations and Member countries and to appeal to them\r\nto take urgent and effective action. We count greatly on the\r\nassistance that can be provided by the European Union, the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and\r\nintergovernmental and regional organizations. The radical\r\nchanges that have taken place in Bulgaria since the\r\naccession to power of the new Government are a stable\r\nguarantee of the success of joint initiatives. Bulgaria has a\r\nsatisfactory democratic framework and a national economic\r\nstrategy that enable it to initiate and carry through\r\nsubstantial projects in such spheres as energy, transport,\r\ntelecommunications and the environment, among others.\r\nBulgarian businesses can play an active role in the\r\nhumanitarian assistance organized by the United Nations for\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, particularly by furnishing supplies to the\r\ninternational peacekeeping forces.\r\nThe United Nations has a number of effective\r\nmechanisms that enable it to provide assistance and at the\r\nsame time offer reliable instruments to respond to the needs\r\nthat arise. International institutions can open special lines of\r\ncredit for the implementation of approved projects, several\r\nof which concern all of Europe as well as the Middle East.\r\nWere they to grant trade preferences, the donor countries\r\nwould encourage exports. They could also encourage their\r\ninvestors to a greater degree, since the changes brought\r\nabout in Bulgarian legislation in this field open up new and\r\npositive prospects.\r\nThe implementation of the collective measures adopted\r\nby the United Nations must be based on the principle of\r\nequitable distribution of the onerous economic repercussions\r\namong all the member countries of the international\r\ncommunity that have the necessary capacity. That is what\r\nis meant by collective responsibility for decisions taken.\r\nBulgaria hopes that a new and far more effective\r\napproach will be adopted vis-à-vis assistance to its economy\r\nto compensate it for the losses it has suffered. It is ready to\r\nparticipate constructively in the discussions under way on\r\nall aspects of the problem, with a view to finding the best\r\nsolution.\r\nMr. Benítez Sáenz (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to make this statement on\r\nagenda item 20 (e) on behalf of the countries members of\r\nthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) —\r\nArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — and the\r\nassociated States of Bolivia and Chile.\r\nWe cannot remain aloof from an item as important\r\nas that of humanitarian assistance, and we stress the\r\nimportance of considering this matter in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOur countries are fully aware of the increased\r\nnumber of natural disasters that have befallen our planet,\r\nand our continent in particular. While mankind has not\r\nbeen able to stave off their inevitable outcome, it has\r\ntaken the first major step in that direction by working\r\ncollectively to cope with such situations.\r\nThe countries members of MERCOSUR believe that\r\nArgentina’s proposal to establish a corps of “White\r\nHelmets” is an international initiative that could provide\r\nthe Organization with a vital tool for dealing more\r\neffectively with humanitarian emergencies.\r\nThis is more than just another new body. It is an\r\nefficient and viable mechanism that will be available to\r\nthe United Nations, with appropriate equipment and\r\ntechnically skilled and trained personnel, with the sole\r\naim of providing immediate assistance in rehabilitation,\r\nreconstruction and development in critical emergency\r\nsituations.\r\nIn the MERCOSUR context, the question of “White\r\nHelmets” was on the agenda of last year’s summit\r\nmeeting at Fortaleza. On that occasion our countries\r\nwelcomed the initiative, and today we can say that such\r\njoint operations are being carried out in three of our\r\ncountries and that they are being monitored by national\r\ninstitutions and our respective foreign ministries.\r\nSince then, there have been three missions in the\r\nMERCOSUR region in Argentina, at Campo Gallo in\r\nSantiago del Estero Province, in Misiones Province and\r\nin the areas recently affected by the flooding of the\r\nUruguay River as a result of the well-known El Niño\r\nphenomenon in Entre Ríos and Corrientes Provinces.\r\nMissions have also been deployed in Alto Verá in\r\nParaguay and in the Argentine-Brazilian border region\r\naround Bernardo de Irigoyen.\r\nUruguay is studying the possibility of joining the\r\nAlto Verá project and is at present selecting volunteers\r\nfor the implementation of a drinking-water project in\r\nHaiti.\r\nIn 1997, in response to a request from the Bolivian\r\nGovernment, “White Helmets”, together with the World\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nFood Programme and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, carried out a project for the control of Chagas’\r\ndisease covering 5,000 households in the Department of\r\nTarija.\r\nCountries that suffer the effects of natural disasters\r\nwill always require speedy and effective action that is\r\napolitical, neutral and impartial and that can only be\r\nprovided through humanitarian assistance.\r\nAs the delegation of Argentina noted in its\r\nintroduction, we believe that the current reform process in\r\nthe United Nations that the Secretary-General and his staff\r\nare so boldly carrying forward affords a unique opportunity\r\nto make in-depth changes in the Organization’s\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nIn 1994, when the idea of creating a “White Helmets”\r\ncorps was put forward, many of the countries that\r\nsponsored the initiative at that time sought to share ideas\r\nabout seeking alternatives to strengthen the response\r\ncapability and effectiveness of the United Nations in the\r\nhumanitarian sphere.\r\nThe active involvement of more than 40 countries in\r\nsupport of the initiative is most relevant and deserves to be\r\nhighlighted. This approach of involving States in support of\r\ninternational volunteer services, as proposed in the “White\r\nHelmets” initiative, will give new impetus to the\r\nparticipation of international civil society and strengthen\r\nand complement the current United Nations system of\r\nvolunteers.\r\nIn addition, the teamwork concept makes the\r\ntraditional approach to volunteerism more efficient in the\r\nconduct of missions, most of which are conducted in\r\nsituations that pose extremely difficult problems of logistics\r\nand of communications with the rest of the world.\r\nThe institutional growth of the “White Helmets”\r\ninitiative shows that it has been accepted conceptually by\r\nthe international community and that it is now time for\r\nnational focal points to begin to work more smoothly and\r\nrapidly. This is undoubtedly the starting point for\r\nstrengthening the capacity of the international community\r\nto respond to humanitarian emergencies through the\r\ncoordination of the United Nations.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like, on behalf of the\r\nentire group, to state our satisfaction at knowing that we\r\nhave this new humanitarian tool that will enable us in the\r\nvery near future to provide assistance to victims of natural\r\ndisasters in our own MERCOSUR countries, as well as in\r\nother regions that so require.\r\nWe hope that this joint initiative will be seen as a\r\nmeans of making full use of the capacity our countries\r\nhold in reserve to provide greater support to the United\r\nNations in its emergency and rehabilitation activities.\r\nMr. Hynes (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nLast July Canada warmly welcomed the measures\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations humanitarian system. These reforms seek\r\nto better focus the capacities of the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator and his new Office on the three core\r\nfunctions established by the General Assembly six years\r\nago.\r\nWe also welcome the appointment of Mr. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello to the post of Coordinator. For Canada,\r\nthe reforms he is to implement must amount to more than\r\na mere reshuffling of previous arrangements. In its\r\nrecommendations on a wide range of issues the working\r\ngroup of the Executive Committee for Humanitarian\r\nAffairs has established an excellent basis on which to\r\napproach this challenge. With his vast experience in the\r\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping fields, Mr. De Mello\r\nshould be able to provide the needed leadership.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn Canada\u0027s view, an important key to the success of\r\nthe humanitarian reform process will be the establishment\r\nof clearer lines of authority and of accountability among\r\nthose involved in emergency-response decision-making.\r\nThe humanitarian agencies, as the ultimate delivery\r\nmechanisms for emergency relief, must clearly be\r\nengaged in the decision-making process, and thus\r\ncommitted to its results. The Inter-Agency Standing\r\nCommittee (IASC) has a crucial role to play in this\r\nregard. To ensure that it will be effective and action-\r\noriented, Canada believes that the IASC should be kept to\r\na manageable size.\r\nBut the essential purpose of the United Nations\r\nhumanitarian machinery is not to secure broad\r\nbureaucratic consensus at any cost. It is, rather, to bring\r\ntimely and effective relief to victims in times of crisis and\r\nconflict. We therefore urge the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator and all IASC members to agree quickly on\r\nthe basic criteria for future coordination arrangements.\r\nAnd when it comes to addressing specific emergencies,\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nwe will look to all agencies to be flexible and to cooperate\r\nfully in responding to requirements identified by the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator. And, ultimately, when quick\r\nconsensus cannot be reached on key issues concerning the\r\nallocation or the sharing of responsibilities, the Coordinator\r\nmust have the authority to decide or, where appropriate, to\r\nrecommend to the Secretary-General clear courses of action.\r\nAn important related question is the role of the\r\nExecutive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs and its\r\nrelationship with the IASC and its proposed steering\r\ncommittee. Canada encourages the Secretary-General and\r\nthe Coordinator to give urgent attention to clarifying the\r\nterms of reference for each of these mechanisms and to\r\nensuring their complementarity.\r\nWe also hope the Security Council will continue to\r\nshow a strong interest in humanitarian matters. The\r\nCouncil\u0027s March meeting with several non-governmental\r\nhumanitarian organizations and its May 1997 debate on\r\nprotection for humanitarian assistance in conflict situations\r\nprovide valuable precedents on which to build. As stated by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, such initiatives hold promise for the\r\ndevelopment of an integrated approach to conflict\r\nresolution, an approach in which the political, military,\r\nhumanitarian, development and human rights dimensions\r\nwould be addressed in a mutually reinforcing fashion.\r\nConcerning resources for humanitarian coordination,\r\nthe new biennium budget proposals being discussed in the\r\nFifth Committee project a continued heavy reliance by the\r\nOffice of the Emergency Relief Coordinator on\r\nextrabudgetary financing. Resources for actual humanitarian\r\nassistance efforts will inevitably continue to be derived\r\nprimarily from voluntary contributions. But it does not\r\nfollow that the basic bureaucratic infrastructure contained\r\nin the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator should\r\nbe dependent on, or preoccupied with, a constant search for\r\nfunds merely to ensure its continued existence and\r\noperation. It is therefore our hope that one day we will\r\nhave an Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator\r\nsecurely and predictably funded in its entirety from the\r\nUnited Nations regular budget.\r\nAllow me to say a few words on one area of activity\r\nbeing divested from the direct responsibility of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator. I want to express Canada\u0027s\r\nprofound appreciation for the leadership role the United\r\nNations Secretariat has played since 1988 in setting up\r\nprogrammes for humanitarian demining in many of the\r\ncountries most affected by the scourge of anti-personnel\r\nmines. We hope that in the process of being transferred\r\nto the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Mine\r\nClearance and Policy Unit will sustain and, indeed,\r\nincrease its effectiveness. We trust that the Department\r\nwill give the humanitarian-demining programme the\r\npriority attention it warrants, and we hope the Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator and the Executive Committee on\r\nHumanitarian Affairs will continue to contribute to the\r\nUnited Nations leadership in this area.\r\nFinally, it is for Canada, as it is for others who have\r\nspoken before us, a matter of grave concern that\r\nhumanitarian personnel are increasingly being required to\r\nperform their duties in environments where they are\r\nsubject to threats and often deadly force. We urge the\r\nnew Emergency Relief Coordinator to give this issue\r\nserious attention, and we encourage all humanitarian\r\nactors to work, in cooperation with the United Nations\r\nSecurity Coordinator, in drawing up recommendations on\r\nmeasures to improve the security of humanitarian\r\npersonnel.\r\nTo conclude, I want to reiterate Canada\u0027s\r\nappreciation for the humanitarian reform measures\r\nintroduced by the Secretary-General. The United Nations\r\nhumanitarian-assistance system plays a crucial, high-\r\nprofile role in meeting the demands placed on the\r\nOrganization today. Getting this aspect of reform right\r\nwill clearly be an important key to ensuring that the entire\r\nUnited Nations reform effort succeeds — and that it is\r\nseen by the world to succeed. In their efforts to make this\r\nhappen, the Secretary-General and the new Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator will have Canada\u0027s unqualified\r\nsupport.\r\nMrs. Mendoza Bilbao (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation fully endorses the statement\r\nmade on the item under consideration by the Ambassador\r\nof Uruguay on behalf of the States members and\r\nassociates of the Southern Cone Common Market.\r\nThe work of the United Nations, in coordination\r\nwith the various agencies of the system, as well as with\r\ninternational and non-governmental organizations, has\r\nbeen and continues to be commendable in providing\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance. The efforts\r\nmade and the results achieved have been considerable, but\r\nthey remain far below the desirable levels of providing\r\nvictims not only with the assistance required at any given\r\ntime, but also with rehabilitation and full incorporation\r\ninto the active life of a society. Aware of the link\r\nbetween humanitarian assistance, poverty and\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\ndevelopment, all those involved in the international\r\ncommunity must commit themselves directly to this\r\nmission.\r\nWe therefore believe that the “White Helmets”\r\nVolunteers initiative opens an innovative route to providing\r\neffective, efficient and economical humanitarian assistance.\r\nIt is important to stress the capacity of this mechanism to\r\nrespond promptly and in a coordinated fashion to natural\r\ndisaster and emergency situations, while remaining\r\napolitical, neutral and impartial in its humanitarian work. It\r\nalso calls for a minimum of fixed costs, using existing\r\norganizations and the assistance capabilities of participating\r\ncountries, which provide volunteers and funds for\r\nhumanitarian activities for emergencies the world over.\r\nDespite its newness, the “White Helmets” initiative\r\nhas contributed significantly to simple emergency\r\nassistance, rehabilitation within the existing programmes of\r\nvarious United Nations agencies and the generation of\r\nadditional United Nations projects. It has a become a\r\ngenuine support mechanism for international assistance and\r\nmobilization throughout the world.\r\nBolivia has, from the outset, supported this far-sighted\r\nidea of Argentina\u0027s. In 1993 and 1994, it carried out an\r\nexperimental programme at the Bolivian-Argentine border,\r\non the basis of which it decided fully to endorse the “White\r\nHelmets” initiative, encouraging concrete activities and\r\nallocating special funds to that end. In this context, in 1995,\r\nBolivia established by supreme decree the National\r\nCommission for the “White Helmets” Movement, jointly\r\nunder the Ministry for Sustainable Development and\r\nPlanning and the Ministry for Health and Social Welfare.\r\nIn November 1996, during the official visit to Bolivia\r\nof the President of the Argentine Republic, a constitutional\r\nagreement was signed, creating the Binational “White\r\nHelmets” Commission. This established provisions for both\r\nStates to observe General Assembly resolution 49/139 B\r\nand committed the respective National “White Helmets”\r\nCommissions to combat poverty and hunger and to resolve\r\nproblems of basic sanitation and education. The Binational\r\nCommission seeks to provide human-resource training to\r\nthat end and may call on the help of experts in specific\r\nareas.\r\nMy delegation wishes once again to reiterate its firm\r\nsupport for the work of the “White Helmets” and appeals\r\nto the international community to give extensive support to\r\nthis mechanism by providing qualified human resources and\r\nfinancial resources to the Special Voluntary Fund of the\r\nUnited Nations Volunteers.\r\nThe delegation of Bolivia, committed to the goals of\r\nthe “White Helmets” Volunteers in activities of the\r\nUnited Nations in the field of humanitarian relief,\r\nrehabilitation and technical cooperation for development,\r\nis a sponsor of the draft resolution submitted under this\r\nitem.\r\nMr. Guarini (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States Government would like to reiterate its\r\nsupport for the establishment of the new Office of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator. We are pleased that the\r\nSecretary-General has moved quickly to name the new\r\nCoordinator and that he has selected a person with so\r\nmuch experience in working on and managing multi-\r\nagency response to humanitarian crises. My Government\r\nlooks forward to working closely with Mr. Vieira de\r\nMello. We will be interested to see how Governments can\r\nbe effectively involved in the policy and decision-making\r\nprocess.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to urge all\r\nagencies to work together with the new Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator. In order for the new office to fulfil its role,\r\nit is important that agencies second highly-qualified\r\npeople from their staff for the senior-management team of\r\nthe Coordinator\u0027s Office.\r\nThe United States is the largest government\r\ncontributor to the voluntarily funded programmes of the\r\nUnited Nations. This increases the value we place on\r\nthese measures for a more effective, efficient and\r\nstreamlined humanitarian response to complex\r\nemergencies.\r\nWe welcome the efforts that organizations are\r\nmaking to systematize their relations with other\r\norganizations through memorandums of understanding.\r\nThese are critical steps towards enhanced coordination\r\nand cooperation. In addition to coordination among\r\nUnited Nations agencies, we urge more reaching out to\r\nother partners, non-governmental organizations and other\r\ninternational organizations that have a wealth of\r\nexperience and input to bring to the table.\r\nThe coordination of relief and development\r\nassistance is on everyone\u0027s lips. The word “continuum” is\r\nfrequently used. My Government believes that, in order to\r\nachieve the continuum, coordination should begin early in\r\na crisis, not at the end. A strategic plan and time-frame\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\ninvolving all the agencies which will play a role in a\r\nhumanitarian situation and its aftermath should be put into\r\nplace as soon as possible. The catalyst behind this, we\r\nbelieve, should be the Emergency Relief Coordinator.\r\nTurning to the specific sub-items, we commend the\r\nGovernment of Argentina for the initiative it has taken in\r\ndevising and promoting the concept of “White Helmets”.\r\nMy Government is pleased to be able to support “White\r\nHelmets” in the field and in the General Assembly.\r\nLet me now say a few words about Chernobyl. The\r\nUnited States recognizes the ongoing effort within the\r\nUnited Nations to address the grave consequences to public\r\nhealth of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The hardships\r\nencountered by the many victims of Chernobyl in Ukraine,\r\nBelarus, Russia and elsewhere are of global concern, so it\r\nis fitting that the nations of the global community should\r\ngather here today in recognition of their continuing plight.\r\nAs chair of the G-7 this year, the United States has\r\nbeen involved in an important effort under the G-7/Ukraine\r\nMemorandum of Understanding on closing Chernobyl by\r\nthe year 2000. As part of our support to Ukraine under this\r\nMemorandum, the G-7 has commenced an international\r\ninitiative to stabilize the deteriorating sarcophagus over the\r\ndestroyed Chernobyl reactor, which has begun to release\r\nradiation into the environment. It is time to begin to help\r\nUkraine develop a longer-term solution to this complex and\r\ndangerous problem, and at the same time to help the\r\nregion — and the world, in fact — to find firm and\r\nenvironmentally-sound answers to the lingering question of\r\nChernobyl. It was for these reasons that the G-7 and\r\nUkraine convened the Chernobyl Sarcophagus Pledging\r\nConference — in which many Governments represented\r\nhere participated — here in New York on 20 November. I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the G-7, to\r\nthank all who participated in that Conference, and in\r\nparticular those who pledged in support of this effort.\r\nThe draft resolution before us today is a reaffirmation\r\nof our commitment not to forget the victims of Chernobyl.\r\nWe must indeed continue to work together, as members of\r\nthe world community who share the global commons, to\r\naddress the tragic Chernobyl experience and legacy.\r\nMr. Moubarak (Lebanon) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): The delegation of Lebanon would first like to\r\nexpress its appreciation for the important report submitted\r\nto us by the Secretary-General on assistance for the\r\nreconstruction and development of Lebanon.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI would like to point out that I am referring to document\r\nE/1997/96, which was also supposed to be issued as a\r\nGeneral Assembly document. I thank the Secretariat,\r\nwhich has promised to make the document available\r\nbefore the impending adoption of the draft resolution on\r\nthis agenda item.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nThis report highlights the developments in the\r\nprocess of reconstruction and development of the country\r\nduring the course of the past year and up until the few\r\nweeks which preceded the convening of the substantive\r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council in June and\r\nJuly 1997. It also points out the strenuous efforts made by\r\nthe Lebanese Government in cooperation with\r\ninternational organization donors and the status of the\r\nimplementation of operational programmes included in the\r\ngeneral strategic plan laid down by the Government,\r\nunder the title of “the plan for the year 2000” which\r\ncovers the years 1997 through 2002.\r\nIt is clear that despite its importance and\r\ncomprehensive nature the report only sketches a general\r\npicture of the trends of the implementation policy of the\r\nsubjects within the framework of the general strategy on\r\nreconstruction and development, along with significant\r\nobservations thereon. It is not possible to gauge in such\r\na succinct report the development that has taken place or\r\nto understand the complexities, difficulties and challenges\r\naccompanying the implementation measures. This report\r\nmust therefore be read with the understanding that it\r\ncomplements numerous other reports drafted by donor\r\norganizations in Lebanon, such as the World Bank, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and others, as\r\nthey dealt with the detailed aspects of the programme\r\ncomponents, thereby helping establish a link between\r\nstrategic topics and the programme components, as\r\nstressed in paragraph 21 of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nIn the past few months, Lebanon has received a\r\ngreat number of leading international donor institutions\r\nand State officials, including the President of the World\r\nBank, the President of the International Institution of\r\nInvestments and Guarantees and the Executive Director of\r\nUNICEF, among others. Likewise, Lebanese officials paid\r\nmany visits to other capitals to help enhance international\r\ninterest, in the process of consolidating civil peace and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nstrengthening reconstruction and development in the\r\ncountry. This active diplomatic movement reflects\r\nincreasing interest in Lebanon’s pioneering and unique\r\nexperience as a post-conflict peace-building country.\r\nMoreover, international interest increasingly emerges\r\nthrough the attention given to it by global mass media,\r\nwhich has expressed admiration for the rise of the phoenix\r\nfrom ashes.\r\nHowever, we believe that this report has not\r\nsufficiently underscored the new philosophy proposed by\r\nthe Secretary-General and the Under Secretary-General for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs with regard to the unique nature of\r\nthe special transitional period experienced by the States\r\nwhich build peace after conflict. In his annual report on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/52/1), the Secretary-General\r\nconsidered that post-conflict situations have special\r\nrequirements and that successful recovery from disturbances\r\ncaused by conflicts is assisted by facing up quickly to\r\ngeneral development challenges, and the provision of\r\nappropriate legal frameworks, stable social and political\r\nenvironments and economic opportunities.\r\nFurthermore, the Under-Secretary-General for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs, Mr. Akashi, recently stressed in his\r\nstatement before the Second Committee of the General\r\nAssembly the need for conflict-solution strategies with a\r\nview to coordinating political, humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment responses on the basis of clear-cut and well-\r\ndefined principles that ensure a positive link between relief\r\nand development. This philosophy lies at the basis of the\r\nwork of the “White Helmets”, as is made clear in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General contained in document A/52/586.\r\nIt would have been possible to view the Lebanese\r\nexperience as an example of this philosophy, along with\r\nrequisite encouraging, or even preferential, measures to\r\nfoster the efforts made and to bring about their success. We\r\nshould take into consideration that these encouraging\r\nmeasures respond to the principle adopted by donor\r\norganizations in preparing their country-development\r\nsessions regarding recipient States, with a view to extending\r\nadditional incentives by increasing the assistance allocated\r\nto these States which succeed in implementing their\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nThe experience of reconstruction and development in\r\nLebanon underscores the effective impact of international\r\nand regional cooperation. It highlights the dynamics of the\r\nmarket system and the effective coordination among basic\r\neconomic actors in the framework of the system, with the\r\nState as the guiding and organizing power, the private\r\nsector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the\r\ncivil sector as the receiving body which is passively or\r\npositively influenced by the programmes.\r\nThe success accomplished by the collective national\r\nwill of the Lebanese people to perpetuate civil peace in\r\ntheir homeland and to reconstruct and develop it has\r\nsometimes led us to forget that we rose from the rubble\r\nand cast off the negative consequences of a war that\r\nlasted for 17 years and destroyed large portions of our\r\ncities and villages. We are dealing with the activities of\r\nreconstruction as if they were development activities\r\ntaking place in a country that had enjoyed peace for\r\ndecades.\r\nThis is a good indicator of the positive evolution of\r\nreconstruction and development in Lebanon, yet it poses\r\nadditional challenges that augment the complexities of the\r\nexceptional circumstances which Lebanon is now\r\nexperiencing. We say this because, like the other Member\r\nStates of the United Nations, Lebanon is called upon to\r\nimplement whatever was agreed in the various\r\ninternational conferences held in the past seven years\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations. This has taken\r\nplace at a time when international development assistance\r\nhas dwindled, economic globalization has increased, and\r\nthe international political and economic rules that affect\r\nthe trends in national economic activities and their ability\r\nto face marginalization and integration into the new world\r\neconomic order have become intertwined.\r\nThe Government’s basic concerns remains centred\r\non building the infrastructure which is necessary to\r\nactivate the economic movement in the country. However,\r\nthese concerns bifurcate to include all sectors, particularly\r\nthe repatriation of evacuees, grappling with environmental\r\npollution, reforming the administration, the development\r\nof outlying areas, and increasing social and health care\r\nand educational programmes. This situation, which\r\ncombines rehabilitation and reconstruction activities with\r\nthe need to establish sustainable development in\r\nconformity with the outcomes of the United Nations\r\nconferences, necessitates the provision of special\r\neconomic assistance by the international community. We\r\ncall upon the international community to provide that\r\nassistance.\r\nWe have striven to have the national-development\r\nsession conform with development sessions of various\r\nUnited Nations operational activities, with a view to\r\nestablishing a link between common themes and\r\nprogramme components within the framework of the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\npublic strategy prepared by the Government for\r\nreconstruction and development. This is why we have\r\ncooperated with a number of main international partners,\r\nparticularly the World Bank. The Lebanese Government has\r\nrepeatedly stated its commitment to cooperation and\r\ncoordination with the representatives of donor States,\r\ninstitutions and the civil and private sectors in the drawing\r\nup of operational programmes within the framework of the\r\ngeneral strategy and monitoring its implementation and\r\nassessing its results. This has been emphasized and\r\ncommended in all of the periodic reports issued by the\r\nrelevant international institutions, including the World Bank\r\nand the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\r\nOne example of this cooperation is the reformulation\r\nof the national reports submitted by Lebanon to the various\r\ninternational conferences held under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations during this decade. Of course, we face\r\nnumerous problems and shortcomings affecting the\r\nimplementation of reconstruction and development\r\nprogrammes. We do not hide this fact. It is conceivable that\r\none of the positive features that helps us bolster these\r\nprogrammes is transparency which governs the economic\r\nactivities of the country. This feature is one of the\r\ncomponents of our democratic system. Thus there is an\r\nopen discussion, including the mass media, of these\r\nproblems and how to tackle them. Such discussion enables\r\nall sectors of the Lebanese population to express their\r\nviews and thus enriches the process of finding solutions and\r\nimplementing them.\r\nWe have taken note of the important observations\r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General, particularly\r\nthose relating to the need to expedite the performance of\r\nadministrative and legislative bodies to absorb available\r\ninternational resources and to increase human resources\r\nwhich are qualified to respond to the implementation\r\nrequirements of envisaged programmes.\r\nYet, one of the basic obstacles to the reconstruction\r\nand development process is the stagnation in the peace\r\nprocess in the region. This is due to Israel’s intransigent\r\npolicy, its refusal to implement Security Council resolution\r\n425 (1978), its continued occupation of parts of the\r\nLebanese territories, and its carrying out of near-daily in-\r\ndepth raids in Lebanese territories. This is in addition to\r\nrepeated threats voiced by Israeli officials, including the\r\nbombardment of infrastructures such as electricity-\r\ngenerating power plants and water-storage facilities, as\r\nIsrael did in the course of its aggression against Lebanon in\r\nApril 1996.\r\nWe wish to express our gratitude to all donors and\r\nto our partners in the process of reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment, particularly those who participated in the\r\n“Friends of Lebanon” Conference, held in Washington on\r\n16 December 1996. By the same token, we hope that\r\ninternational support will continue and be enhanced in\r\norder to assist our country to realize its comprehensive\r\nprogramme of reconstruction and development.\r\nMr. Gorelik (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): Russia attaches great importance to\r\nstrengthening the United Nations system’s capacity to\r\ntackle humanitarian crises and other emergencies. For a\r\nnumber of reasons, we were not able to discuss the entire\r\nrange of problems relating to this coordinating role of the\r\nUnited Nations at last summer’s session of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, but we hope that this issue will not\r\nbe put on a back burner and that it will receive thorough\r\nconsideration during the humanitarian segment of the\r\nupcoming substantive session of the Council next year.\r\nThis should allow us to adopt substantive\r\nrecommendations aimed at streamlining and strengthening\r\ncooperation among all humanitarian partners.\r\nOur delegation attaches great importance to the\r\ndebate on the July reform package proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General, including his proposal to transform the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs into the Office of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator. We welcome the\r\nappointment of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello to the post of\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator and hope he will\r\nparticipate actively in the efforts to solve the complex\r\nproblems relating to humanitarian operations,\r\npreparedness and early warning for emerging\r\nhumanitarian crises. We expect the Coordinator to focus\r\non the priority areas of the Office’s activities — policy\r\nissues, coordination and advocacy of humanitarian\r\nprinciples — and also on promoting interaction with the\r\nSecurity Council, including the humanitarian aspects of\r\nsanctions. We hope that the New York and Geneva\r\nbranches of the Office will work closely together in a\r\nproductive collaboration with humanitarian agencies and\r\nall other parties involved in the efforts to deal with\r\nemergencies.\r\nRussia takes this opportunity to express its\r\nappreciation to Under-Secretary-General Yasushi Akashi,\r\nwho is retiring now. He made an extraordinary\r\ncontribution to United Nations efforts in the area of\r\nhumanitarian response, and we wish him every success in\r\nhis future endeavours.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nI should like now to turn to post-Chernobyl activities.\r\nFirst of all, I would highlight the importance of last May’s\r\nUnited Nations inter-agency mission, in which\r\nrepresentatives of donor countries and other organizations\r\nassessed the needs of the States affected. We also welcome\r\nthe international seminar on the theme, “Chernobyl and\r\nbeyond: humanitarian assistance to victims of technological\r\ndisasters”, which was organized last May by Russia with\r\nthe assistance of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs.\r\nWe attach great importance to these events, which were\r\npart of the effort to take practical measures to help the\r\nvictims. The proposals put forward at those meetings by\r\ninternational experts were in line with the special\r\nprogramme on protecting the people affected up to the year\r\n2000, which was adopted by the Government of the\r\nRussian Federation last August.\r\nRussia is grateful to the United Nations for the work\r\nof the inter-agency programme of international assistance to\r\nChernobyl-affected areas, and it expects that projects under\r\nthis programme will become part of the work of the special\r\nCoordinator on Chernobyl, who will focus on mobilizing\r\nthe support of the world community. In this connection, we\r\ntrust that the special meeting on Chernobyl, to be held here\r\ntomorrow, 25 November, will have fruitful results. We urge\r\nMember States to participate actively in this meeting.\r\nWe are also counting on the support of Member States\r\nfor the consensus adoption of a draft resolution on the\r\nstrengthening of international cooperation to mitigate the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl disaster. The draft is\r\nsponsored by the three countries affected: Belarus, the\r\nRussian Federation and Ukraine.\r\nWe would like to turn now to the humanitarian\r\nsituation in Tajikistan. Resolution 51/30 J resulted in\r\nconcrete efforts to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in this\r\nneighbouring and friendly country. We welcome also the\r\ncurrent donors’ conference in Vienna, and we expect it to\r\nmake an important contribution to dealing with that\r\nemergency. Russia is actively involved in the peace\r\nsettlement and the restoration of normalcy as well as in\r\nassisting the affected population. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General confirms the urgency of the humanitarian\r\nsituation, particularly for the most vulnerable groups. It is\r\nimportant that humanitarian agencies continue their work in\r\nTajikistan in 1998.\r\nWe are following with great sympathy and genuine\r\ninterest the recent work on the “White Helmets” initiative.\r\nSome achievements have been made, but the initiative, we\r\nfeel, should be given additional impetus in advancing\r\ntowards one of its principal original goals: to develop a\r\nnetwork of volunteer teams that would respond rapidly to\r\nemergency situations. Here we need to utilize not only the\r\ncapacity of United Nations volunteers but also of that of\r\nhumanitarian agencies and national rescue teams.\r\nTurning to yet another problem area, we also are\r\nconcerned about growing threats to and attacks on\r\nhumanitarian personnel. We believe it important and\r\nrelevant to address this problem in a General Assembly\r\nresolution. All parties involved in conflicts should adhere\r\nto the principles governing humanitarian assistance and\r\nrespect international humanitarian law. Of course, this is\r\nmore easily said than done, but every effort should be\r\nmade to protect humanitarian personnel. The Security\r\nCouncil issued a timely reminder of that imperative in its\r\nstatement of 19 June 1997.\r\nBecause there are such a regrettable number of\r\nconflict situations, it is important to continue to focus our\r\nattention on the continuing crises in the Great Lakes\r\nregion, in the Horn of Africa, in Angola, and in Africa as\r\na whole. In all these cases, we must take into account not\r\nonly the symptoms but the causes of the disease:\r\nunderdevelopment, the struggle for resources and ethnic\r\ntensions. These root causes, I would point out, are\r\napplicable to all “hot spots”.\r\nMr. Tesfaye (Ethiopia): The agenda item on\r\nstrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including\r\nspecial economic assistance to individual countries in\r\nvarious regions, is of considerable interest to my\r\ndelegation. Many parts of the world have continued to be\r\nafflicted by natural and man-made disasters and\r\nemergencies. This combination of man-made and natural\r\ndisasters has created an enormous demand for United\r\nNations involvement and assistance.\r\nSpecial programmes of assistance to distressed\r\ncountries and emergency humanitarian assistance are,\r\nindeed, today’s greatest challenges to the United Nations\r\nand to the international community as a whole. In\r\nEthiopia, as we grapple with the many manifestations of\r\nsocio-economic underdevelopment, we continue to\r\nencounter a multitude of impediments as a result of our\r\nlimited capacity to cope with very grave adverse\r\nexogenous factors.\r\nNotwithstanding the important achievements in our\r\nefforts to attain food self-sufficiency over the past several\r\nyears, the effects of the recent global climatic change\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nknown as El Niño have posed a serious challenge. This\r\nclimatic change is currently affecting the countries of our\r\nsubregion, resulting in an immense human toll and material\r\ndestruction, as witnessed in Somalia, where more than\r\n2,000 people have already died and where many more are\r\nexposed to an extremely dangerous situation. In Ethiopia as\r\nwell, the situation has become alarming with the continued\r\nunseasonable rainfall, which has led to the destruction of\r\ncrops in certain parts of the country, thus causing a chronic\r\nfood shortage. As a result of this, the Ethiopian Disaster\r\nPrevention and Preparedness Commission has appealed to\r\nthe international community to provide 154,107 metric tons\r\nof emergency food assistance for distribution among the\r\naffected population. In this connection, my delegation\r\nwould like to call upon the international community, and in\r\nparticular the United Nations system, to mobilize support\r\nand assistance.\r\nThe question of refugees and displaced persons\r\npresents yet another humanitarian challenge which needs a\r\nmore vigorous approach and response. Despite our\r\neconomic difficulties, Ethiopia continues to host a large\r\nnumber of refugees and to rehabilitate thousands of\r\nreturnees and displaced persons. The hosting of large\r\nnumbers of refugees has meant increased exploitation of\r\nalready scarce resources, and has also had a bearing on the\r\nenvironment as a source of energy, shelter and food. In the\r\nlight of this, it is our view that the scope of humanitarian\r\nassistance should be widened to address such problems\r\nencountered by host countries.\r\nIt is true that all those problems and others are shared\r\nby many developing countries, especially those in Africa.\r\nTherefore, while we appreciate all the bilateral and\r\nmultilateral assistance being extended to us in the many\r\nareas of economic and emergency activities, we continue to\r\nemphasize the need for greater coordination and integration\r\nof the humanitarian response with reconstruction and long-\r\nterm development to complement our national efforts.\r\nEmergency assistance should not be viewed as a form\r\nof support designed to last forever. Economic assistance\r\npermitting greater economic advances by creating\r\ndevelopment-friendly framework conditions and an\r\nopportunity for attaining self-sufficiency is of paramount\r\nimportance. Furthermore, the United Nations agencies\r\ndealing with emergencies and development cooperation\r\nshould be streamlined to ensure efficiency and to use the\r\ndwindling resources at their disposal in a more cost-\r\neffective manner, focusing on programme activities. In this\r\ncontext, my delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\nmeasures and proposals aimed at reforming the\r\nhumanitarian activities of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation believes that in undertaking\r\nemergency humanitarian activities the inputs of affected\r\ncountries or regions are pertinent. These activities should\r\nin particular make greater use of local know-how in the\r\nplanning and implementation of programmes and projects.\r\nGiving recipient Governments project responsibility and\r\ninvolving local experts would lead to more efficiency,\r\ncost-effectiveness and sustainability.\r\nThe need for greater commitment to financing\r\nmultilateral cooperation in emergency humanitarian\r\nassistance and to contributing to development is crucial,\r\nas inadequate funding renders the successful\r\nimplementation of projects difficult.\r\nMy delegation would like to see the Inter-Agency\r\nStanding Committee (IASC) strengthen its function as the\r\nprimary mechanism for interagency coordination under\r\nthe United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator. The\r\nIASC should also look into so-called homeless issues\r\nsuch as the question of treatment of internally displaced\r\npersons and the problem of the continuum from\r\nemergency relief to rehabilitation. Especially on the\r\nproblem of the continuum from emergency relief to\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction, the United Nations\r\nsystem should plan a comprehensive policy and strategy\r\nfor the post-emergency period in a given situation, so that\r\nthe momentum for multilateral cooperation to cope with\r\nemergency situations may be sustained and developed\r\nthrough the stage of rehabilitation and reconstruction.\r\nWith regard to the development of an emergency\r\ninformation and early-warning system, as stressed in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 46/182 and 48/57, Ethiopia\r\ntakes note of the efforts made so far by various agencies\r\nin this field and earnestly hopes that the mechanisms put\r\nin place will be further developed so that an improved\r\nlevel of coordination may be achieved.\r\nMy delegation believes that policies and strategies\r\nrelated to disasters, whether in terms of emergency\r\nresponse or of preventive measures, need to include a\r\nvulnerability analysis of the effects of the environment,\r\nthe human element and the ecology. The need for\r\nvulnerability assessments has become all the more\r\nimportant since such assessments lead to a better\r\nunderstanding of vulnerability to disasters, which in turn\r\nhelps decision-makers to take appropriate measures to\r\nmitigate and overcome them. Furthermore, such\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nassessments, in addition to helping in the planning of\r\nappropriate programmes to reduce vulnerability, also\r\nprovide information which makes it easier to target\r\nbeneficiaries, to prepare relief plans and to put in place the\r\nright preparedness modalities in such a way that they\r\nenhance development efforts. But this alone will not yield\r\nall the capacities required to tackle the root causes of\r\nvulnerability unless it is augmented by the financial,\r\nmaterial and technical assistance of our development\r\npartners.\r\nIn concluding, I wish to emphasize the importance of\r\nthe work that the United Nations is undertaking to help\r\npeople in desperate need of the support and assistance of\r\nthe international community. Behind the statistics of\r\nmissions conducted, dollars contributed and tons of supplies\r\ndelivered by the international community, there is the\r\nhuman reality of lives saved, children fed and hopes reborn.\r\nTherefore, the important humanitarian mission of this world\r\nbody, the United Nations, deserves the full support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Mirza (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The delegation of the United Arab Emirates\r\nsincerely thanks the Secretary-General for his notes and\r\ncomprehensive reports on strengthening of the coordination\r\nof humanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the United\r\nNations, including special economic assistance. These\r\ndescribe the various humanitarian activities carried out by\r\nthe United Nations to meet the increasing demand for\r\nhumanitarian assistance in various parts of the world. We\r\nare grateful too for the leading role played by the\r\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs in this area.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates agrees with other speakers\r\nabout the destructive effects of natural disasters and other\r\nemergencies, particularly those that cause great loss of\r\nhuman life, property and State infrastructure, and that have\r\nfar reaching effects on the social and economic\r\ndevelopment plans of developing countries, in particular the\r\nleast-developed countries. Despite United Nations efforts to\r\ncontain the negative humanitarian effects resulting from\r\nseveral of these disasters, humanitarian needs have not been\r\nmet to the requisite degree on a wider scale. This is due to\r\nthe exacerbation of existing crises on the one hand, and the\r\napparent lack of resources on the other hand. This situation\r\nrequired an increase in humanitarian assistance and\r\nactivation of the relevant United Nations machinery, in\r\nparticular the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the\r\nCentral Emergency Revolving Fund.\r\nFurthermore, the need calls for strengthening\r\ncoordination between the aforementioned and other\r\nregional and international development programmes, and\r\nfirst and foremost the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund, in order to mobilize economic resources\r\nand their generous influx of contributions required for a\r\nspeedy response to the needs of affected and vulnerable\r\npeoples.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is among the leading\r\ncountries that have worked in earnest, acting upon the\r\ninstruction of His Excellency Sheikh Zayed ibn Sultan Al-\r\nNuhayyan. It has paid special attention to external\r\nhumanitarian assistance issues and has provided\r\nunparalleled assistance to many developing countries,\r\nparticularly those which have suffered natural disasters\r\nand civil and regional wars.\r\nIn confirmation of our commitment to a\r\nhumanitarian approach based on our authentic Arab\r\ncustoms, civilizational values and the noble precepts of\r\nIslamic Shari\u0027a, we have established the Abu Dhabi\r\nDevelopment Fund as one of the main channels for\r\nproviding developing countries with assistance and\r\nconcessional loans in order to help them in the\r\nimplementation of their various projects in the fields of\r\neducation, health, agriculture and other humanitarian\r\nservices. We have also participated in other funds and\r\nfinancial establishments dealing with development,\r\nespecially those in developing countries and in the least\r\ndeveloped countries. This is not to mention bolstering the\r\nrole of institutions and charitable organizations, notably\r\nthe Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent,\r\nas well as other organizations, aimed at helping them\r\nachieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of\r\nmobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors,\r\nand meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency\r\ndemands in parts of the world that have been affected or\r\nare impoverished.\r\nThroughout the past few years, successive world\r\nevents have indicated that disasters — caused by people\r\nresorting to armed force in their ethnic, civil, ideological\r\nor border wars — have been increasing in a manner\r\nunprecedented in modern history. Such crises have been\r\nreflected in the exacerbation of many dangerous\r\nhumanitarian problems, such as displacement, poverty,\r\nunemployment, illiteracy, ecological deterioration,\r\nexposure to chronic diseases and permanent physical\r\ndeformation of individuals. Therefore, my Delegation,\r\nwhich expresses its concern over the continuation of such\r\nissues, supports peaceful, just, permanent and\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\ncomprehensive solutions to these conflicts on the basis of\r\ninternational legitimacy and the rules of international law.\r\nWe also support other efforts to establish early warning\r\nmechanisms and effective data bases that can contribute to\r\nmaximizing the capacities for disaster management and a\r\nspeedy international response to the requirements of sudden\r\nemergencies and to the implementation of development\r\nprojects and reconstruction in affected countries.\r\nThe reports on the occupied Palestinian and other Arab\r\nterritories indicate a regression in the economy of the\r\nPalestinian people compared with its level before the start\r\nof the peace process. This is the inevitable result of the\r\ncollective economic punishment, and the policy of blockade\r\nand starvation pursued by the Israeli Government vis-à-vis\r\nthe Palestinian people. It is also the result of the stringent\r\nrestrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities and its armed\r\nforces, which are equipped with weapons which are most\r\ndangerous to humanity, in order to limit the movement of\r\nthe Palestinian people\u0027s sons and goods to and from the\r\ncities of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and their suburbs. This\r\nis not to mention other unjust practices aimed at preventing\r\nor delaying receipt by the Palestinian Authority of\r\ninternational support funds. Such practices have delayed the\r\ncompletion of projects to construct industrial complexes and\r\nthe opening of the Gaza port and airport. Moreover, the\r\nimplementation of programmes of international\r\nhumanitarian agencies concerned with the provision of\r\nassistance has been obstructed.\r\nThis has precipitated the spread of disease and poverty\r\nin the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. It has led\r\nto a decrease in production in the Palestinian Authority\u0027s\r\nareas of more than 60 per cent and to at least a 65 per cent\r\nincrease in unemployment. This is considered a flagrant and\r\nclear violation not only of the peace agreements but also of\r\nall relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and of all\r\ninternational humanitarian pacts and norms.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates pins great hopes on\r\ninternational development assistance in support of plans for\r\nthe establishment of national Palestinian institutions and for\r\ndeveloping the local technical capacities of the Palestinian\r\npeople in order to enable it to implement its economic and\r\nsocial development plans with a view to its proper\r\nintegration into international trade. We reaffirm the\r\nimportance of bringing international pressure to bear on the\r\nIsraeli Government to force it immediately to stop its\r\ndangerous policies that violate the basic human rights of the\r\nPalestinian people. We urge the international community,\r\nparticularly the donor countries, to meet their obligations in\r\na manner that will help to achieve a better life for the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the reports which are under discussion today.\r\nThey are exhaustive and comprehensive in nature and\r\nrespond to the importance that the international\r\ncommunity attaches to the crucial issue of humanitarian\r\nassistance. India also accords the highest importance to\r\nthe provision of humanitarian assistance to those in need,\r\nwhile respecting fully the guiding principles for such\r\nassistance that have been so clearly outlined in section I\r\nof the annex to resolution 46/182. These principles are\r\nvalid and time-tested, and their continued application\r\nwould contribute towards success in relieving pain and\r\nsuffering.\r\nWe have noted that the Secretary-General has\r\npreferred to present a more comprehensive report on the\r\nfollow-up to resolution 46/182 at the fifty-third session of\r\nthe General Assembly, keeping in view several actions\r\nand recommendations that have been proposed, and are\r\nbeing considered by us, for reform of the humanitarian\r\nsector of the United Nations. While we await the report\r\nof the Secretary-General with great interest, it is essential\r\nthat the reform process does not lead to a reinterpretation\r\nof the guiding principles of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThese are notably humanity, neutrality and impartiality;\r\nfull respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nnational unity of States; primary importance of the\r\nconsent of the affected countries and their appeal; and,\r\nfinally, the primacy of the role of the affected State in the\r\ninitiation, organization, coordination and implementation\r\nof humanitarian assistance within its territory. My\r\ndelegation would support all humanitarian activities under\r\nthe United Nations aegis within these specified\r\nparameters.\r\nWe would also like to stress that the gravity of\r\nhumanitarian emergencies should not blur the distinctions\r\nbetween the various United Nations agencies or override\r\nthe requirements, desires or wishes of sovereign\r\nGovernments. Clear distinctions need to be made in\r\ndefining the relationship between functions and\r\nimperatives of peacekeeping and peacemaking, and the\r\nprinciples of humanitarian access. The distinction is a fine\r\none, but nevertheless a relevant, crucial and valid one. It\r\nwas stressed at the last Ministerial Conference of the\r\nNon-Aligned Countries in New Delhi in April 1997.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nWe are therefore concerned about the statements that\r\nhave been made in some of the reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, notably document A/52/586, that activities\r\nundertaken in response to humanitarian emergencies have\r\nextended to areas like conflict prevention and resolution. It\r\nhas also been indicated that there is a need to explore\r\nfurther the potential contribution of some humanitarian\r\nactors in preventive action, particularly in the humanitarian\r\nand development fields. Such concepts, which are yet to\r\nreceive intergovernmental mandates, may further complicate\r\nand detract from the task of providing humanitarian\r\nassistance to victims of natural disasters and other\r\nemergencies.\r\nIn the context of international development\r\ncooperation, my delegation would caution against detailed\r\nand comprehensive reports becoming a mechanism for\r\nseeming acceptance of ideas that are still evolving in other\r\nforums. I refer specifically to document A/52/532, which in\r\nparagraph 43 refers to the inability of the United Nations\r\nsystem in Somalia to avail itself of established institutional\r\nmechanisms, such as preparation of a country strategy note.\r\nMy delegation would like to stress that a country strategy\r\nnote is, and remains, a voluntary initiative, in the context of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, and is not an\r\nessential institutional mechanism.\r\nI would now like to refer briefly to the agenda item on\r\nassistance to the Palestinian people. We have noted the\r\nefforts of the Special Coordinator, focused on coordination\r\nof donor-funded projects, provision of budgetary support to\r\nthe Palestinian National Authority and strengthening of\r\ninstitution-building programmes. India, despite constraints,\r\nhas been contributing to the process of assistance to the\r\nPalestinian people through scholarships and cultural\r\nexchange programmes. More than 50 specialized training\r\nslots were offered during the period April 1996 to March\r\n1997, at an estimated cost of 5.5 million rupees. India also\r\npledged $1 million at the Washington donor\u0027s Conference\r\nin October 1995 and a further $1 million at the subsequent\r\npledging conference in Paris in January 1996. These\r\npledges are being utilized both for provision of goods and\r\nfor undertaking projects in the Palestinian National\r\nAuthority territory. India has also offered to set up a\r\ncommon facility centre for imparting training in vocational\r\nactivities such as software development, computer\r\nprogramming and computerized numerically controlled\r\n(CNC) machines.\r\nMy delegation has noted, with concern, that while the\r\nneeds for humanitarian assistance have increased, the\r\nresponse of the donors has not been proportionate or\r\nadequate. To cite but one example, we are concerned that\r\nfor Angola, as against the requirement of $228.48 million\r\nfor the period January to December 1997, an amount of\r\nonly $61.89 million, or 28.7 per cent, had been pledged\r\nor received in contributions by the end of September\r\n1997. There is a need to ensure provision of adequate\r\nfinancial resources for the implementation of activities\r\nrelated to humanitarian assistance, while at the same time\r\nensuring that such resources are additional to, and not\r\ndiverted from the already scarce resources for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy delegation commends the continued efforts of\r\nthe United Nations system, despite this uncertain resource\r\nposition, to bring relief and assistance to those in need in\r\nseveral parts of the world. Its actions have served to\r\nunderline the predominant and central role of the United\r\nNations in the coordination of humanitarian assistance.\r\nWe are convinced that the reforms of the United Nations\r\nin the humanitarian sector will further enhance its ability\r\nto respond to the emerging needs.\r\nBefore I conclude, I wish to convey my delegation\u0027s\r\ndeep appreciation and admiration for the dedication and\r\ncommitment with which many relief and assistance\r\norganizations and personnel, United Nations and non-\r\nUnited Nations, are functioning, under the most difficult\r\nand trying conditions, in bringing succour to those in\r\nneed. They often work under daily threats to their own\r\npersonal safety and security and deserve our unstinted\r\npraise.\r\nMr. Kenik (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of Belarus,\r\nI should like to congratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on\r\nhis presidency of this prestigious international forum. As\r\nin the past, we have gathered here to discuss further\r\noptions and measures to provide assistance to the victims\r\nof the most devastating technological disaster in the\r\nhistory of humankind. The consistent position of the\r\nUnited Nations with regard to the problem of Chernobyl\r\nshows once again that kindness and compassion remain\r\nthe paramount values of the human race, forging and\r\nstrengthening mutual understanding and friendship\r\nbetween peoples.\r\nThe widely attended international scientific\r\nconferences held in 1995 and 1996 in Minsk, Geneva and\r\nVienna were unanimous in concluding that the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster had devastating consequences both for people\u0027s\r\nhealth and for the environment. It was recognized that the\r\nlong-term consequences of Chernobyl require careful\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nstudy by scientists throughout the world. The long-term\r\nconsequences, including genetic consequences, of the\r\nconstant impact of low doses of radiation over many years\r\nhave not been sufficiently studied. It will require more than\r\none decade to study their impact on people and on the\r\nenvironment.\r\nEvidence of our inadequate knowledge about the\r\npossible radiological consequences of such an accident is\r\nprovided by the unprecedented increase in thyroid cancer\r\namong children in Belarus. That is why the State policy of\r\nthe Republic of Belarus in mitigating and overcoming the\r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl disaster is based on the\r\nlong-term nature of its effects on human health and the\r\nstate of the environment, and also on the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of the affected territories.\r\nThe level of socio-psychological tension conditioned\r\nby the Chernobyl factor remains high in the polluted\r\nterritories, but not only there. People still perceive the\r\nradiation risk as representing a serious danger to their\r\nhealth.\r\nThe problem of how to rehabilitate the affected\r\nregions is further complicated by an imbalance in the\r\nresident population structure and the serious shortage of\r\nqualified personnel, such as doctors, teachers and\r\nagricultural specialists. The exodus of such specialists from\r\nthe area in the first years after the disaster was particularly\r\nmarked. It is difficult to estimate the economic damage to\r\nBelarus caused by the Chernobyl disaster. Some 15 to 20\r\nper cent of our total budget is devoted to dealing with its\r\nconsequences every year. This is a huge burden, adding to\r\nthe difficulties of implementing economic reforms.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 50/134, which was\r\nadopted by consensus, provided a political basis for\r\nrevitalizing the bilateral and multilateral cooperation among\r\ndonor countries, specialized agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem and the States that suffered from the disaster at the\r\nChernobyl nuclear power plant.\r\nWe deeply appreciate the work of the United Nations\r\nin coordinating international cooperation to deal with the\r\nconsequences of the disaster, but at the same time we must\r\nnote that the implementation of General Assembly\r\nresolution 50/134 has been rather slow. In recent years,\r\ninternational assistance to affected States has substantially\r\ndecreased, basically due to a lack of resources.\r\nHowever, in this connection we would like to express\r\nour appreciation to Under-Secretary-General Akashi for his\r\nwork in preparing for and carrying out the United Nations\r\nneeds-assessment mission to the three affected countries\r\nin May this year. The result of that mission was an\r\nobjective and unbiased assessment of the post-Chernobyl\r\nsituation, which was reflected in the United Nations inter-\r\nagency programme of international assistance to the\r\naffected areas. Basically, that programme can be seen as\r\na strategy for international Chernobyl cooperation in the\r\nsecond decade following the disaster. Tomorrow, 25\r\nNovember, here at the United Nations, a conference of\r\ndonors to strengthen the Chernobyl sarcophagus will take\r\nplace, just a few days after the International Chernobyl\r\nShelter Pledging Conference for Governments. These two\r\nevents show how multifaceted the Chernobyl problems\r\nare and how active the United Nations has been in this\r\narea. They also demonstrate that the Organization is\r\ncommitted to the long-term study, mitigation and\r\nminimization of the consequences of the disaster. We\r\ntrust that tomorrow’s conference will yield positive\r\nresults.\r\nThe areas affected present the following problems:\r\nthe need for new jobs, the need to develop the\r\ninfrastructure and the need for more investment in their\r\neconomies.\r\nAs part of the new strategy for cooperation with\r\ndonor countries, Belarus is willing to consider the\r\nquestion of new forms of cooperation: favourable terms\r\nfor long-term credit, provision of equipment for specific\r\npurposes with extended terms for repayment and joint\r\nenterprises, as well as the possibility of providing tax\r\nrelief to donor countries and special economic zones and\r\nthe granting of concessions.\r\nWe are very grateful to all the countries and\r\norganizations that have provided technical and\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nInternational assistance in dealing with the\r\nconsequences of Chernobyl must be seen as a prerequisite\r\nfor the countries involved to move ahead to sustainable\r\ndevelopment. One effective way of lending assistance in\r\ntimes of major disaster is to provide help that will lead to\r\nself-help, and this involves intensive socio-economic and\r\necological rehabilitation of the affected regions. Such an\r\napproach is fully in accordance with the models for\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe representative of Ukraine, on behalf of the three\r\naffected countries, has introduced a draft resolution on\r\nstrengthening international cooperation and coordination\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nof efforts to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences\r\nof the Chernobyl disaster.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus believes that the draft\r\nresolution reflects the right approach to solving the\r\nproblems through international cooperation. Its adoption\r\nwill create the necessary conditions for implementing the\r\ninter-agency programme of international assistance to\r\naffected areas.\r\nIt is quite clear that this process requires the\r\ncoordinating role of the Department of Humanitarian\r\nAffairs. The Department should develop a procedure for\r\ninteraction between the United Nations system and the\r\ndonor countries, the affected countries and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations using new forms of\r\ncooperation, including humanitarian and technical\r\nassistance, mutually beneficial economic cooperation in the\r\nregions affected by the disaster and a determination of\r\nprocedures for choosing the best kinds of joint projects for\r\nproviding assistance.\r\nOnly the Department of Humanitarian Affairs can\r\nproperly coordinate international cooperation on the\r\nChernobyl issue. It can help enhance the effectiveness of\r\nprojects carried out by the specialized agencies and assist\r\nin streamlining procedures for actually choosing which\r\nprojects to proceed with. Such an approach will mean a\r\nbetter division of labour among the specialized agencies of\r\nthe United Nations and those responsible for actually\r\ncarrying out the work.\r\nWe also feel that we should restore the earlier\r\nregulation which was used by the Quadripartite Ministerial-\r\nlevel Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl and the\r\ninter-agency assessment mission and that separate meetings\r\nshould be held twice a year.\r\nThe Chernobyl disaster was indeed a terrible warning\r\nto the human race. Chernobyl made us understand that the\r\nearth is our common home — a truly beautiful speck of life\r\nand reason in the depths of the universe that has become\r\nextremely fragile in the hands of the human race, which has\r\nmastered the secret of the atom. The international\r\ncommunity can now fully understand that it is only by\r\nworking together against man-made and natural disasters\r\nthat we can achieve a united world for the benefit of future\r\ngenerations.\r\nMr. Ayoub (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): There\r\nis no doubt that the role of the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies is constantly growing in the provision\r\nand coordination of humanitarian and emergency\r\nassistance to refugees and countries that are victims of\r\nman-made and natural disasters.\r\nThe reports before us clearly set out the role that the\r\nUnited Nations has played and continues to play in this\r\nfield in various places, such as Angola, Madagascar, the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, the countries of Central Africa, Lebanon,\r\nEl Salvador, Djibouti, Tajikistan, the Sudan, Somalia and\r\nother countries.\r\nNonetheless, my delegation believes that the United\r\nNations and the international community currently deal\r\nwith the refugee problem in terms of its symptoms, not its\r\ndeep-rooted causes and that is why this problem remains\r\nchronic and thus the considerable efforts and energies\r\nexpended by the international community are wasted. We\r\nmust therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes, such\r\nas poverty, armed conflicts, economic sanctions,\r\neconomic imbalances, ethnic conflicts, environmental\r\nproblems, desertification, deforestation, inadequate\r\ninternational cooperation and, above all, the problems of\r\nindebtedness, technology transfers, the provision of\r\ninternational financial aid to developing countries and the\r\nexploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade,\r\nall of which lead to greater flows of refugees across\r\ninternational borders, as the current international situation\r\nshows.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation notes that the High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees designates as refugees people\r\nwho have left their countries because they are being\r\npersecuted for political reasons, or because of the\r\ninsecurity and instability that prevail in their native lands.\r\nHowever, we do not think this definition reflects the\r\nactual situation for it does not take into account refugees\r\nwho, due to the deterioration of economic conditions, are\r\ncompelled to leave their countries to seek better living\r\nconditions for themselves and their families. With regard\r\nto strengthening the role of the United Nations in this\r\narea, we believe that our Organization can make an\r\neffective contribution to resolving this problem, within its\r\nresponsibilities for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, if it takes the following measures.\r\nFirst, we need to generate and develop international\r\nsolidarity and cooperation to prevent or limit conflicts, as\r\nthey can lead to population displacement. Similarly,\r\nreconciliation should be fostered wherever possible,\r\nparticularly in post-conflict situations, as part of continued\r\nefforts to find solutions.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nSecondly, we have to emphasize neutrality and avoid\r\nthe politicization of problems and generalizations when\r\ngranting financial or humanitarian assistance to try to find\r\nhumanitarian solutions, whether this is done directly, on the\r\nbasis of governmental initiatives, or through humanitarian\r\norganizations.\r\nThirdly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their\r\nProtocols should provide the legal framework for granting\r\nsuch international humanitarian assistance.\r\nFourthly, humanitarian assistance should be placed\r\nwithin the context of long-term development assistance,\r\nwhile taking due account of the sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity and political independence of States, and they\r\nshould be consulted once it has been decided that assistance\r\nwill be provided.\r\nFifthly, the United Nations must adopt an agenda for\r\nhumanitarian assistance, just as it did with regard to peace\r\nand development.\r\nSixthly, consideration should be given to reforming the\r\nSecurity Council in a way that affirms the international\r\ncharacter of the United Nations, in particular for the\r\ndeveloping countries, and improving the Council’s working\r\nmethods to avoid abuse and promote the cause of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nSeventhly, with regard to conflicts, we should place\r\nthe emphasis on conflict prevention and try to find peaceful\r\nsolutions to conflicts through measures that promote peace,\r\nsuch as development, justice and the democratization of\r\ninternational relations, and avoid adopting coercive\r\nmeasures, such as those set out in Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter. Such measures should be used only in very\r\nexceptional cases once all other options have been\r\nexhausted, including those based on regional arrangements\r\nor geographical considerations. If certain coercive measures,\r\nsuch as those set out in Chapter VII, have to be used, we\r\nmust first make sure that the United Nations will not be\r\nused to further the foreign policy goals of some influential\r\nmembers of the Council. In this regard, I must emphasize\r\nthe harmful effects of economic sanctions on displaced\r\npersons or refugees.\r\nOnce sanctions have been imposed, it is necessary to\r\nensure respect for the principles decided on by the Sub-\r\ngroup on Sanctions of the Working Group of the General\r\nAssembly on “An Agenda for Peace”. It is also necessary\r\nto ensure that the sanctions are in keeping with the Charter;\r\nthat their objectives and the conditions for lifting them are\r\nclear; and that they do not cause humanitarian problems\r\nfor the population as a whole. The country targeted by\r\nsanctions should know exactly what it must do for them\r\nto be lifted. Foodstuffs and medicines, along with\r\nagricultural and educational equipment, should not be\r\nrestricted.\r\nMy country, Iraq, as the rest of the world is aware,\r\nhas had an extremely bitter experience as a result of\r\neconomic sanctions. The maintenance of the economic\r\nblockade has led to a shortage of foodstuffs and\r\nmedicines and a decline in the living conditions of all\r\nIraqis. Some of our people have had to leave the country\r\nand seek refuge elsewhere to improve their living\r\nconditions, hoping to return once sanctions have been\r\nlifted and living conditions have improved.\r\nIn the north of the country, conflicts between armed\r\ngroups are being encouraged by certain Powers that are\r\nintervening directly by unilaterally imposing, outside the\r\nframework of the United Nations, no-fly zones, another\r\nreason for a mass exodus of Iraqi refugees to other\r\ncountries. The ideal way to end their ordeal would be for\r\nother countries, including certain neighbouring countries,\r\nto stop interfering in the region’s internal affairs. That\r\nwould enable the State to play its role of ensuring\r\nsecurity and stability, thus encouraging the refugees to\r\nreturn, knowing they will be safe.\r\nFinally, through you, Sir, I would call on the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations to step\r\nup their efforts to lift the unjust economic embargo\r\nimposed on our country, so that it can create a suitable\r\neconomic and social environment which will encourage\r\nthe return of all the refugees who have been forced by the\r\nembargo to leave their country and families. We also call\r\non the Organization to provide Iraq with development\r\nassistance to rebuild its infrastructure, which was totally\r\ndestroyed during the 1991 military aggression and by the\r\nembargo that, under all kinds of pretexts, continues to\r\nweigh heavily on us.\r\nThe Acting President: I would ask speakers to\r\nmake statements at a pace that allows the interpreters to\r\nfollow and interpret.\r\nBefore giving the floor to the next speaker, I should\r\nlike to make an announcement concerning this agenda\r\nitem, on the strengthening of the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the United\r\nNations, including special economic assistance.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nI should like to remind delegations that, in view of the\r\nlarge number of draft resolutions expected under this item\r\nand the possible need to hold consultations on them with a\r\nview to reaching consensus, and as we are already\r\napproaching the end of November, members are strongly\r\nurged to submit those draft resolutions within the next few\r\ndays, but not later than Monday, 1 December. I repeat that\r\nthe deadline for submission of draft resolutions on this item\r\nis Monday, 1 December.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe recent review of the humanitarian reaction capacity of\r\nthe United Nations system was urgently needed. It will help\r\nus introduce essential changes to increase the effectiveness\r\nof assistance provided under United Nations auspices in\r\nemergency situations. We hope that on the basis of the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals we will be able to work\r\nproductively and take a significant decision on these issues\r\nat the next session of the General Assembly.\r\nThis issue is not simply academic; it is of the greatest\r\npractical significance for our country in particular, in\r\nparticular, in view of the situation in Tajikistan since mid-\r\n1992. Despite considerable difficulties, our Government has\r\ndone, and is doing, everything possible to deal with the\r\nhumanitarian crisis which has enveloped the country as a\r\nresult of internal conflict. However, these efforts would\r\nhave fallen short but for the help given by outside friends\r\nand sympathizers. We are very grateful to all donors,\r\nincluding Governments, humanitarian agencies within the\r\nUnited Nations system, other international organizations and\r\nthe many non-governmental organizations, charity and\r\nindividual citizens. Their assistance helped mitigate the\r\nhumanitarian situation resulting from the devastation,\r\nphysical suffering and other ills that go hand in hand with\r\ncivil strife and armed opposition.\r\nWe are grateful for the General Assembly’s adoption\r\non 5 May 1997 of resolution 51/30 J, which reflected the\r\nincreased attention given by the international community to\r\nthe trials and deprivations of the population of Tajikistan.\r\nThe appeal, drafted jointly by United Nations organizations\r\nand institutions, dealing with the humanitarian needs of the\r\nTajik population, made it possible to set clear priorities and\r\ndetermine how much outside help was urgently needed. On\r\nthe whole, we were pleased with how donors reacted.\r\nOur delegation has prepared, and will be presenting,\r\na similar draft resolution on the question of humanitarian\r\nassistance to Tajikistan. We trust that it will receive a\r\npositive response and will be adopted at this session.\r\nWe would note in particular that the Government of\r\nTajikistan has been moving forward to carry out the\r\nfundamental task on the agenda, namely, to restore peace\r\nand normalcy to our country as quickly as possible. On\r\n27 June 1997, after three years of difficult and intensive\r\nnegotiations, we were able to sign in Moscow the General\r\nAgreement on the Establishment of Peace and National\r\nAccord in Tajikistan, which established a transitional\r\nperiod of 12 to 18 months for the implementation of all\r\nits provisions, including such issues as amnesty, mutual\r\nforgiveness, repatriation, reintegration of refugees,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of opposition fighters,\r\nthe reform of government structures and various other\r\nlegal and political issues.\r\nWe trust that the international community will not\r\nstand aside from our troubles but will continue to provide\r\neffective and targeted support as we seek to achieve our\r\ngoals. Despite the importance of the General Agreement\r\nand the overall significantly improved situation with\r\nrespect to compliance with the truce and the ceasefire, the\r\nhumanitarian situation in our country is still difficult, as\r\ncan be seen from the report of the Secretary-General in\r\ndocument A/52/500.\r\nThe food situation is of particular concern.\r\nAccording to estimates by the United Nations and others\r\ninvolved in humanitarian work in Tajikistan, this year the\r\nnumber of those requiring emergency food assistance\r\nexceeded 900,000, or one out of every six citizens,\r\nprimarily old people, women and children.\r\nThanks to efforts by the World Food Programme,\r\nand also to donors such as the European Union, the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and a number\r\nof countries and non-governmental organizations, on the\r\nwhole we have been able to meet the minimum food\r\nneeds of our people. However, next year, given the\r\ndifficulties facing our national agricultural sector and the\r\nfood sector as a whole, we will still need international\r\nfood aid. The same applies to the vulnerable groups in\r\nour population. They will still need medicine, health\r\nservices and other basic services, including restoration of\r\nthe infrastructure, sanitation and the water supply.\r\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative of preparing an inter-agency appeal for\r\nhumanitarian assistance to Tajikistan in 1998. We need\r\nemergency assistance, as well as help in rebuilding and\r\nrehabilitation. That is the only way in which we can come\r\ncloser to lasting peace and ensure a fairly normal situation\r\nand economic development.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nWe are also hopeful about the donors’ conference on\r\nTajikistan currently taking place in Vienna with broad\r\nparticipation. We must rely on the understanding and\r\nsolidarity of the international community for an appropriate\r\nresponse to the humanitarian needs of our country.\r\nOur country shares the pain and suffering of other\r\nStates where, as a result of conflict, natural disaster and\r\nother emergency situations, the people have the same\r\ndramatic needs as our own, and are forced to turn to the\r\nother peoples of the world for assistance and support. Great\r\nhumanitarian efforts are being made by the United Nations\r\nin the Middle East, the Great Lakes region, Angola,\r\nSomalia, Djibouti, the Horn of Africa and the countries of\r\nCentral America. We believe that we must also strengthen\r\nmeasures to ensure the security of humanitarian personnel\r\nworking in the territories of those countries, with their\r\nconsent.\r\nWe support the efforts made by various donors, and\r\nthe ongoing coordination function of the United Nations\r\nwith regard to international assistance in the post-Chernobyl\r\nperiod. We welcome the steps taken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for new projects to rehabilitate the people and\r\nmitigate the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant.\r\nWe would hope that the lofty humanitarian mission of\r\nthe United Nations will continue to be regarded as one of\r\nthe top priorities of our Organization, and that it will be\r\nsupported by all those who are not indifferent to human\r\nsuffering and pain.\r\nMr. Awaad (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nEgypt’s statement under this agenda item will focus on sub-\r\nitem (d), “Assistance to the Palestinian people”. In this\r\ncontext, I would like to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the report contained in document\r\nA/52/159.\r\nI am saying nothing new when I tell the Assembly\r\nabout the assistance and support which the brotherly\r\nPalestinian people is receiving from the Government and\r\npeople of Egypt. The Madrid Peace Conference of 1991\r\nand the Oslo Accords of 1993, as well as subsequent\r\naccords, were important stages in the struggle of the\r\nPalestinian people for self-determination. Egypt had to\r\nmake whatever contribution it could to increase the ability\r\nof the Palestinian brothers to run their internal affairs and\r\nimprove their economic situation, so as to benefit that\r\nbrotherly people, which has suffered, and is still suffering,\r\nfrom the tyranny of occupation and all its collateral effects.\r\nThe need for that assistance and support remains\r\nurgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by\r\nthe Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, in\r\nview of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli\r\ncoercive measures, including closures and restrictions on\r\nthe movement of workers and commodities to and from\r\nthe West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an\r\nadditional burden increasing the suffering of the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nAfter the election of the Palestinian Authority, Egypt\r\nwas quick to extend the necessary support to enable it to\r\ndischarge its responsibilities. A national committee from\r\nall ministries of Egypt was established to specify the\r\nmanner in which each would provide the appropriate\r\nassistance to the fledgling autonomous rule in Palestine.\r\nAs a result, a number of agreements were signed with the\r\nPalestinian Authority, such as the agreements on postal\r\nservice, transportation and education. A number of other\r\nagreements were also signed with a view to establishing\r\ninstitutional linkages between the organs of the fledgling\r\nPalestinian Authority and their Egyptian counterparts,\r\nwhich practically meant facilitation from the side of\r\nEgypt in the fields relating to the agreements which were\r\nsigned.\r\nMoreover, Egypt has also trained a large number of\r\nPalestinian police cadres who have constituted the nucleus\r\nof a Palestinian police force that is carrying out its\r\nnational task with strict discipline and efficiency.\r\nSimilarly, Egypt has lent its expertise to the officials\r\nselected by the Palestinian Authority to speak on its\r\nbehalf abroad and to defend the Palestinian cause in all\r\nStates and international forums. Egypt is also attempting\r\nto join with other parties in any form of tripartite\r\ncooperation to lend technical assistance to Palestinians in\r\nall areas. In this regard, I would refer to the agreement\r\nbetween Egypt, Norway and the Palestinian Authority to\r\ntrain personnel in the nursing profession with a view to\r\nrectifying the shortage which the Palestinian National\r\nAuthority faces in this field. Egypt is also cooperating\r\nwith the Palestinian Authority in planning and\r\nimplementing the construction of the port at Gaza with a\r\nview to its becoming an important commercial link for\r\nthe Palestinian people with the outside world.\r\nIn another context, and at the level of the private\r\nsector, Egyptian businessmen have not held back initiating\r\na number of economic projects with their Palestinian\r\ncounterparts designed to enhance the efficiency of the\r\nPalestinian economy and save it from the consequences of\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nthe destructive closures imposed on it at random by Israel.\r\nEgypt’s role is not confined to the extension of moral and\r\nmaterial support and assistance in kind. Egypt is also\r\nexerting every effort and through all means to urge all\r\nfriendly States to increase their assistance and to abide by\r\ntheir commitments to the Palestinian National Authority in\r\norder that the Palestinian leadership will be able to realize\r\nthe aspirations of the Palestinian people, who have suffered\r\nso long the scourges of war, displacement and repression.\r\nIt is high time for the Palestinian people to harvest the\r\nfruits of peace.\r\nIn this connection, I should like to commend the\r\nimportant role played by the United Nations, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, as\r\nwell as all specialized agencies and organs in providing the\r\nnecessary support to the Palestinian people. We commend\r\nspecifically the role played by the Special Coordinator. We\r\nhereby, and within this framework, call for increased\r\ncoordination among all United Nations and international\r\norgans, donor countries and the Palestinian Authority. All\r\nthese entities have affirmed, in all symposiums and\r\nconferences held on the provision of economic assistance to\r\nthe Palestinian people, renewed willingness to enhance their\r\nsupport to the Palestinian Authority on the basis of specific\r\npriorities to implement necessary development activities.\r\nIn this connection, we salute the efforts of the United\r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\r\nin the Near East (UNRWA), particularly the initiatives\r\ntaken by its High Commissioner, whether directly or within\r\nthe international framework provided by the Agency to\r\nchannel economic and humanitarian assistance to the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nEgypt hopes that, with the assistance and contributions\r\nprovided by all of us, the Palestinian people will take their\r\nfirst steps towards economic and social development. Egypt\r\nappeals to the world’s States to fulfil their commitments to\r\nextend assistance. Similarly, we call upon those States that\r\nhave not yet extended assistance in this respect to consider\r\ndoing so, and generously, in order to realize that noble\r\nobjective of serving peace in the entire Middle East and of\r\nbenefitting a people trying valiantly to establish its State on\r\nits own territory.\r\nMr. Bull (Liberia): At the outset, my delegation\r\nwishes to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive report (A/52/678) of 13 November\r\n1997 on the post-conflict humanitarian situation in Liberia\r\nand the efforts that are being undertaken by the\r\nGovernment of Liberia, in collaboration with the United\r\nNations, regional and subregional organizations and\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental agencies, to\r\nmove the country along the continuum of normalcy,\r\nassistance, recovery and development.\r\nOur commendation also goes to Mr. Yasushi Akashi,\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, and\r\nhis able staff for their coordination of relief and\r\nhumanitarian activities in Liberia. Since Mr. Akashi is to\r\nretire shortly, my delegation wishes to join previous\r\nspeakers in paying a deserved tribute to him for his\r\nleadership and outstanding contribution to the work of the\r\nOrganization. We wish him well in his future\r\nundertakings.\r\nAfter seven years of civil conflict, Liberia faces the\r\nformidable challenge of rebuilding its infrastructure and\r\nreviving its economy. The Government is also concerned\r\nabout several hundred thousand of its nationals who\r\nremain as refugees in neighbouring countries awaiting\r\nrepatriation. The internally displaced require resettlement,\r\nand ex-combatants, including a significant number of\r\nchild soldiers, must be rehabilitated so as to become\r\nproductive members of civil society.\r\nThe successful holding of presidential and legislative\r\nelections on 19 July 1997 has renewed the hope of the\r\nLiberian people that the unfavourable effects of the war\r\nwill soon be addressed. A duly elected civilian\r\nGovernment under the leadership of President Charles\r\nGhankay Taylor has formulated and is striving to\r\nimplement pragmatic policies to promote national\r\nreconciliation and unity, economic revival and durable\r\npeace. The Government believes that the full participation\r\nof all Liberians is a necessary condition for the\r\nachievement of economic recovery and political stability.\r\nIt has identified those sectors that require priority\r\nattention, such as food and nutrition, electricity and water\r\nsupply, and health and sanitation. Revitalization of the\r\nsubsistence agricultural sector, from which about 70 per\r\ncent of the population derives its livelihood, is also a\r\nfocal point in the recovery process.\r\nAs regards its national economic plan, the\r\nGovernment has maintained a free-enterprise system and\r\nis encouraging development of the private sector as one\r\nof the primary vehicles for economic growth. In the\r\npublic sector, it has emphasized fiscal discipline, public\r\naccountability and transparency in the management of\r\nresources. Since the installation of the new Government,\r\nrevenue collection in the country has steadily improved.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nTeams from both the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund have made several visits to Liberia, and we\r\nare encouraged by their initial assessment. It is my\r\nGovernment’s hope that favourable consideration will be\r\ngiven to its request that some of its external debts be\r\nforgiven.\r\nIn order to sustain a culture of peace in Liberia, as\r\nwell as to meet the difficult challenges of reconstruction\r\nand development, the Government has requested the\r\nSecretary-General to establish a United Nations peace-\r\nbuilding support office in Liberia. The Government notes\r\nwith deep appreciation that the Secretary-General has\r\naccepted its request and is moving as expeditiously as\r\npossible to establish this important office in the country.\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank the international\r\ncommunity and donor Governments for the sustained\r\nhumanitarian assistance provided to Liberia during its civil\r\nwar. As the transition is made from relief to the resumption\r\nof normal development activities, it is necessary that\r\nLiberia be provided continued assistance in order to help\r\nconsolidate peace in the country.\r\nIt is against this background that the African Group —\r\nthrough its Chairman, the Permanent Representative of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho — has submitted a draft resolution\r\nentitled “Assistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction\r\nof Liberia”. That draft resolution requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to continue his efforts to mobilize all possible\r\nassistance within the United Nations system to help the\r\nGovernment of Liberia in its reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment, as well as to undertake as soon as possible,\r\nin collaboration with the Government of Liberia, an overall\r\nassessment of needs, with the objective of holding a\r\ndonors’ conference for the reconstruction and development\r\nof Liberia. It is my delegation’s hope that the draft\r\nresolution will be unanimously adopted by the General\r\nAssembly and that all friendly Governments will participate\r\nin the forthcoming donors’ conference, which will be held\r\nin Geneva in February of next year.\r\nFinally, my delegation is in agreement with the\r\nSecretary-General’s assessment that the humanitarian\r\nsituation in Liberia has substantially improved following the\r\ninstallation of a constitutionally elected Government.\r\nHowever, much remains to be done in order to ensure\r\ndurable peace, stability and development in Liberia. While\r\nreaffirming my Government’s commitment to meet the\r\nneeds and aspirations of its people, I, and my country, hope\r\nthat we can continue to rely on the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 3237 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974\r\nand resolution 43/177 of 15 December 1988, I now call\r\non the Observer of Palestine.\r\nMr. Jilani (Palestine) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me at the outset to express, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation, our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport contained in document A/52/159. We would also\r\nwould like to express our deep gratitude for the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations Special Coordinator in the Occupied\r\nTerritories, Mr. Chinmaya Gharekhan, and for the key\r\nrole played by the Office of the Special Coordinator in\r\nfacilitating and coordinating the activities of the United\r\nNations institutions through effective action in the field.\r\nThe Palestinian people deeply appreciate the efforts\r\nof the international community to help them succeed in\r\ntheir struggle and to face the new challenge confronting\r\nthem as they work to build their country and its\r\ninstitutions under the current difficult conditions.\r\nSimilarly, we would like to express our deep appreciation\r\nto the international community for the initiatives it has\r\nundertaken to save the peace process and to achieve\r\ntangible progress at all levels. Such progress would have\r\na positive impact on the economic and social conditions\r\nof the Palestinian people.\r\nIn this context, we would like to express our\r\ngratitude to all the States and organizations that provide\r\nassistance to the Palestinian people. It is our great hope\r\nto see the international community honour its\r\ncommitments to help the Palestinian people restore their\r\neconomy, which has been destroyed, and to lessen the\r\nimpact of Israeli policies on the living conditions of our\r\npeople.\r\nThe basic message that emerges from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report that we have before us is that the\r\ninfrastructures of all the vital sectors have been destroyed.\r\nIndeed, the occupation authorities have completely\r\nneglected them for three decades. The occupation\r\nauthorities continue to collect exorbitant taxes from the\r\nPalestinian people and to plunder their natural resources,\r\nyet, according to the report, from 1970 to 1992 they spent\r\n$15 per inhabitant for infrastructure in the West Bank and\r\nthe Gaza Strip, as opposed to $1,500 per Israeli\r\ninhabitant — which is 100 times more. And we have not\r\neven mentioned the policies and measures imposed by the\r\nIsraeli Government since 1993.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nThese truths are reflected in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport contained in document A/ES-10/6, which was\r\nsubmitted in accordance with resolution ES-10/2 of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Allow me to quote the following\r\nparagraph:\r\n“The realization of the principle of territorial\r\nintegrity, as enunciated in the Oslo accords, has been\r\nfrustrated during the period under review by Israeli\r\nrestrictions on the movement of persons and goods\r\nbetween so-called A, B, and C areas of the West\r\nBank, between Jerusalem and the rest of the West\r\nBank, between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and\r\nbetween the occupied territories and the outside world.\r\nSafe passage arrangements have not been established,\r\nand arrangements for a Gaza seaport and airport have\r\nnot been agreed upon. The Israeli policy of general\r\nclosure, which has been in effect since 30 March\r\n1993, imposes explicit restrictions on the mobility of\r\ngoods and persons. There are fixed Israeli checkpoints\r\non Palestinian roads, including key transport routes,\r\nand a system of differentiated mandatory permits for\r\nlabourers, business people, medical personnel and\r\npatients, students, religious worshippers, and all other\r\ncategories of Palestinians. Restrictions on entry to\r\nJerusalem block access to the main north-south\r\ntransportation route in the West Bank, necessitating\r\nlengthy and costly detours. This general closure has\r\nbeen aggravated by periodic comprehensive closures\r\nentailing the complete denial of such movements\r\nduring a full 353 calendar days between 30 March\r\n1993 and mid-June 1997.” [A/ES-10/6, para. 22]\r\nThe report goes on to say in the same paragraph:\r\n“Israeli restrictions on the movement of goods and\r\npersonnel are also imposed on United Nations officials\r\nand project materials, resulting in delays and added\r\ncosts for development projects in the West Bank and\r\nGaza Strip and in serious disruption of the work of\r\nhumanitarian agencies.” [ibid.]\r\nThese extremely serious policies and practices not only\r\nviolate the agreements reached; they also reflect the Israeli\r\nGovernment’s policy of vengeance on and collective and\r\narbitrary punishment of the Palestinian people. Such\r\npolicies and practices cannot be justified by security\r\nconcerns. The international community has already\r\ncondemned them. Economic and living conditions in the\r\nPalestinian territories are continually deteriorating. Indeed,\r\nthe economy’s performance has worsened, the average\r\nPalestinian income has fallen significantly and\r\nunemployment has reached a very high level. This, in\r\nturn, aggravates the economic and political problems.\r\nThese deteriorating living conditions and the\r\nfrustration with the peace process arising from the new\r\nIsraeli Government’s policies have made it almost\r\nimpossible to discuss cooperation or the peace process.\r\nOn several occasions, we have warned the Israeli\r\nGovernment immediately to abandon its policy of\r\ncollective reprisals, closures, blockades and unjust\r\nrestrictions. We must give up any hope of successful\r\nregional cooperation and economic cooperation\r\nconferences so long as the Palestinian economy is being\r\ndestroyed and the peace process undermined. The failure\r\nof the most recent conference on economic cooperation\r\nspeaks eloquently in that respect.\r\nIsrael’s respect for agreements reached and for their\r\nimplementation, its abidance by international law, and an\r\nend to its policy of blockade and collective reprisals are\r\nall sine qua non conditions for saving the peace process,\r\nensuring its success and alleviating the suffering and\r\nimproving the living conditions of the Palestinian people.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 45/6 of 16 October 1990, I now call\r\non the observer for the International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross.\r\nMrs. Junot (International Committee of the Red\r\nCross) (interpretation from French): In recent years, the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has\r\nclosely followed the debate on strengthening the\r\ncoordination of emergency humanitarian assistance and\r\nwelcomes this renewed opportunity to share a few\r\nthoughts on this topic. We are convinced that\r\nstrengthening coordination among the various\r\nhumanitarian organizations, both in field operations and\r\nin the conceptual approach to them, is essential if they are\r\nfully to achieve their objectives.\r\nThe ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency\r\nsituations arising from armed conflict and internal\r\nviolence, which are often marked by widespread and\r\nurgent needs among the civilian population and by the\r\nbreakdown of political, economic and civic institutions.\r\nSuch situations require humanitarian organizations to\r\nharmonize their responses and avoid any duplication of\r\nefforts. Coordination should aim at carefully orchestrating\r\nthe conduct of different types of activity, over time and\r\nin a frequently volatile and rapidly changing environment.\r\nIt should be instrumental in broadening the impact of\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nhumanitarian efforts and in ensuring the best use of donor\r\nfunding.\r\nThe ICRC believes that humanitarian action, on which\r\nthe fate of many thousands of people often depends,\r\nrequires proper assessment and planning, professional\r\nmanagement and constant evaluation. Humanitarian\r\norganizations involved in emergency response therefore\r\nneed to recognize their interdependence. Inappropriate\r\nbehaviour or lack of professionalism on the part of some\r\ncan adversely affect the efforts undertaken by others. It can,\r\nmoreover, lead to a dangerous lowering of standards in\r\nhumanitarian aid.\r\nIn this connection, we shall refer briefly to the issue\r\nof security of humanitarian workers. The growing risks to\r\nwhich humanitarian organizations have been exposed in\r\nrecent years are undoubtedly due to changing realities in the\r\npattern and conduct of warfare. These risks have been\r\nfurther compounded by the proliferation of aid agencies\r\nwith divergent objectives and different working methods.\r\nWarring parties often view the humanitarian world as a\r\nwhole, without distinguishing between the various\r\norganizations; in other words, if one agency offends them,\r\nall may be affected by the consequences. The security of all\r\nthe organizations thus depends on the security of each.\r\nProper coordination and compliance with common\r\nfundamental principles can undoubtedly help to improve the\r\nsafety of humanitarian personnel.\r\nHere, we should like to highlight the importance of\r\ncodes of conduct and terms of reference which seek to\r\nregulate the way in which humanitarian operations are\r\ncarried out, specify the conditions attached to the provision\r\nof relief and establish minimum standards that ought to be\r\nuniversally applied. In 1993, the International Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent Movement adopted a code of conduct\r\nwhich has since been endorsed by over 100 non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and which was welcomed by\r\nconsensus by the representatives of 142 Governments at the\r\nmost recent International Conference of the Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent. This code is one attempt to set universal,\r\npractical and professional standards in emergency\r\noperations and to address the issues of ethics and\r\naccountability.\r\nThe ICRC wishes to stress its full commitment to take\r\npart in United Nations coordination efforts. It recognizes\r\nthe need to strengthen appropriate United Nations-led\r\ncoordination mechanisms, such as the Inter-Agency\r\nStanding Committee. Its participation in these mechanisms\r\nis, on the one hand, prompted by its concern to achieve the\r\ngreatest possible complementarity between its own efforts\r\nand those of the United Nations and humanitarian\r\norganizations; and, on the other, conditioned by its\r\ndetermination to fulfil its special role as an independent\r\nand neutral intermediary in situations of armed conflict,\r\nwhich is enshrined in the Geneva Conventions.\r\nApart from its contribution to the work of United\r\nNations coordination mechanisms, the ICRC has also\r\nbeen pursuing a bilateral dialogue with United Nations\r\nagencies and bodies, including the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the\r\nWorld Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Office\r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as\r\nsome of the major non-governmental organizations\r\ninvolved in emergency situations or humanitarian\r\nadvocacy. The objective of this dialogue is to enhance\r\nmutual understanding and strengthen sectoral coordination\r\nand cooperation.\r\nFor many years, the ICRC has played a major role\r\nin coordinating humanitarian endeavours in the field. It\r\ndid so, for example, in Cambodia in the early 1980s\r\ntogether with UNICEF, in Somalia in the early 1990s, and\r\nmore recently in the Russian Federation, in Chechnya,\r\nuntil the brutal murder of six of its field personnel —\r\nmostly medical staff from national Red Cross Societies —\r\nforced it to withdraw last December. The ICRC currently\r\nplays a leading role in conflict areas — in Afghanistan\r\nand Sierra Leone, for instance — and in the domain of\r\nprotection and emergency relief for internally displaced\r\npersons in Colombia and Sri Lanka.\r\nThe ICRC is willing to assume field coordination\r\nresponsibilities, and is prepared to do so, on a pragmatic\r\nand voluntary basis and without prejudice to its specific\r\nmandate, particularly in places where it is de facto the\r\nmain humanitarian organization in place. The ICRC\r\nalready coordinates the relief efforts of national Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation in\r\nconflict situations, pursuant to the statutes of the\r\nmovement. In all its operations the ICRC attempts to\r\nreach victims of the conflict on all sides, with the consent\r\nof the parties involved.\r\nWe should also point out that in some countries,\r\nsuch as Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nand Afghanistan, national Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nSocieties play an invaluable role, particularly in\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nstrengthening local mechanisms for coping with\r\nemergencies. Furthermore, in a transition period such as we\r\nare currently experiencing in the former Yugoslavia,\r\nnational Societies from other countries are increasingly\r\ninvolved in achieving the ICRC’s goals by implementing\r\nrehabilitation projects.\r\nBesides recognizing the need to strengthen\r\ncoordination between aid agencies, the ICRC considers it\r\nessential to further enhance consultation and cooperation\r\nbetween humanitarian organizations and political bodies.\r\nSuch interaction should lead to a more precise division of\r\ntasks and responsibilities between the humanitarian\r\norganizations that are working to alleviate human suffering\r\nand the political entities whose primary duty it is to tackle\r\nthe root causes of conflict and to restore conditions for\r\npeace and stability.\r\nThe ICRC finds it encouraging that over the past few\r\nyears humanitarian issues have been given greater\r\nprominence on the agendas of political bodies such as the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe and the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThis is clearly reflected in the increasing openness of these\r\nbodies and their interest in direct interaction with\r\nhumanitarian organizations.\r\nDespite the constructive dialogue which has taken\r\nplace in many forums and brought together humanitarian\r\nand political bodies, the ICRC notes with growing concern\r\nthat there is a tendency, particularly in Central Africa, to\r\nresort to humanitarian action as a substitute for political and\r\nmilitary action. But let us be quite clear on this point: when\r\nviolence, as the expression of a deliberate policy, reaches\r\nsuch a pitch that the survival of entire populations is at\r\nstake, the response to crises cannot be limited to\r\nhumanitarian action. Massacres and genocide, which are\r\nabove all political crimes, can be effectively combated only\r\nthrough political and, if necessary, military action.\r\nTherefore, ICRC can only hope that States and the\r\nUnited Nations will not concentrate on humanitarian action\r\nalone in certain areas of the world, while neglecting\r\npolitical responses to conflicts. It is convinced that\r\nhumanitarian action should complement, rather than replace,\r\npolitical action and, where needed, peace-keeping or peace-\r\nenforcement operations.\r\nIf the provision of humanitarian aid becomes, or is\r\nperceived to be, conditional on the behaviour of warring\r\nparties, or if it is entirely linked to political objectives, that\r\nwill lead to situations in which some victims “deserve”\r\nprotection and assistance more than others. For the ICRC\r\nthis would of course be intolerable, calling into question\r\nthe very essence of its humanitarian approach.\r\nFurthermore, if humanitarian aid is used to promote\r\nforeign policy objectives, it may become a contributory\r\nfactor in increasing the vulnerability of representatives of\r\nhumanitarian organizations. The security of personnel\r\ndepends, to some extent at least, on the way in which\r\ncombatants perceive humanitarian action. In practical\r\nterms, if combatants see a humanitarian organization as a\r\nfactor likely to influence the course of the conflict, or if\r\nthey view it as a symbol of what they are fighting\r\nagainst, they may try to harm it in some way, and its\r\npersonnel thus become easy targets.\r\nThe ICRC is convinced that humanitarian agencies\r\nand political leaders should engage even more than in the\r\npast in a regular and far-reaching dialogue. It is therefore\r\npaying increasing attention to its interaction with regional\r\nand global political bodies, and recognizes the need to be\r\nproactive in matters involving humanitarian diplomacy. In\r\nthis connection, we should like to mention the ICRC’s\r\nconvening of a humanitarian forum in Wolfsberg,\r\nSwitzerland, to examine the growing challenges in this\r\nfield. Some 70 high-level representatives of donor\r\nGovernments and humanitarian organizations participated.\r\nThe forum was a follow-up to the humanitarian summit\r\norganized by the European Community Humanitarian\r\nOffice (ECHO) in Madrid in December 1995. The ICRC\r\nintends to pursue this dialogue and convene a similar\r\nforum next year.\r\nWe should also like to mention that, at the invitation\r\nof the Belgian Government, an international symposium\r\nfocusing on the relationship between humanitarian action\r\nand political-military action is scheduled to take place in\r\nBrussels in February 1998.\r\nAnother important event will be the first periodic\r\nmeeting on international humanitarian law which the\r\nSwiss Government, as the depositary of the Geneva\r\nConventions, is convening in January 1998. The meeting\r\nwill essentially deal with armed conflicts linked to the\r\ndisintegration of State structures and the issue of respect\r\nfor and protection of humanitarian personnel.\r\nThe response to the challenges ahead will depend on\r\nthe international community’s ability and will to find\r\ncomprehensive solutions to humanitarian problems. Such\r\nsolutions must incorporate the political, social and\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\neconomic elements without which humanitarian aid can\r\naccomplish little of lasting value.\r\nMr. Pedersen (International Federation of Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent Societies): The International Federation\r\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies welcomes again\r\nthe opportunity to share a few observations on this\r\nimportant agenda item on the strengthening of the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance.\r\nAt the heart of the coordination debate is, in our\r\nopinion, a concern for the quality and effectiveness with\r\nwhich we in the international community respond to the\r\nsuffering of those caught up in catastrophe and conflict. In\r\nthis respect, we applaud the proposal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the new Office of the Emergency Relief\r\nCoordinator within the United Nations system, which\r\nrecognizes not only the need for more pragmatic\r\ncoordination among operating United Nations bodies but\r\nalso the equally vital need for coordination between policy\r\ndevelopment, crisis response and diplomacy. We believe the\r\nplans for the new Office demonstrate an understanding that\r\nhumanitarian efforts which deal with the consequences of\r\ncrisis are no substitute for political action to address its\r\ncauses and cessation. In this context, the International\r\nFederation is keen to see a strong role continue for the\r\nInter-Agency Standing Committee as one of the few forums\r\nthat brings together United Nations and non-United Nations\r\nhumanitarian agencies.\r\nWithin the disaster-response community, the concern\r\nfor quality of response is growing fast and generating a\r\nnumber of exciting practical endeavours. Three years ago,\r\nthe Federation, together with the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross (ICRC) and some international non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, launched the code of conduct\r\nfor relief agencies and workers. This is a 10-point code of\r\nbehaviour which seeks to safeguard the independence of\r\nagencies and to ensure that their motivation is humanitarian\r\nrather than political or commercial. It talks about a\r\nrelationship between aid workers and beneficiaries which\r\nrespects human dignity and local capacities. It emphasizes\r\nthe need for transparency in our dealings and accountability\r\nto our supporters.\r\nThe code has now been endorsed by some 131\r\ninternational non-governmental organizations, including all\r\nof the major agencies commonly seen operating in today\u0027s\r\ncomplex emergencies. At the most recent International Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Conference in 1995, 147\r\nGovernments welcomed the code and pledged their support\r\nto making it work. Tangible evidence of this support can\r\nnow be seen in many donor countries, where the code is\r\nbeing used as a yardstick against which to judge agency\r\nsuitability for funding and competence of implementation.\r\nHost Governments are starting to use it as a way of\r\nensuring the quality of agencies entering their country,\r\neither directly or by encouraging in-country, non-\r\ngovernmental organization coordinating bodies to use it.\r\nIt is becoming an accepted standard. Agencies are\r\nexpected to behave in this way, and their peers, the media\r\nand their donors are starting to question behaviour which\r\ndoes not come up to this standard — proof, we think, that\r\nself-policing and steady pushing for high standards\r\nachieves results where quick-fix solutions and imposed\r\nregulations fail.\r\nIn an exciting new development, the International\r\nFederation, non-governmental organizations, church\r\nagencies and the ICRC — which between them are the\r\nend-point deliverers of some 95 per cent of international\r\nhumanitarian assistance — have come together to develop\r\na second-generation code which will lay down minimal\r\nperformance criteria for independent agencies and will\r\ndefine, for the first time, both a universal best practice for\r\nagencies and the quantity and quality of assistance\r\ndisaster victims have a right to expect from assistance\r\nagencies. This work, dubbed the “Sphere project”,\r\nsupported by United Nations operational agencies and\r\nfunded by non-governmental organizations and donor\r\nGovernments, aims to produce an international set of\r\nfield-applicable standards by the middle of next year. We\r\nbelieve that this major initiative marks a key turning point\r\nin the quality of both the accountability and service that\r\nindependent agencies are committed to giving, and will\r\nmake a significant contribution to coordination among\r\nsuch agencies.\r\nCoordination is not an issue only within the\r\nhumanitarian community. More than 11 years ago, the\r\nexplosion in reactor number 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear\r\npower plant created a new category of disaster. Dealing\r\nwith that disaster — which we are still dealing with\r\ntoday — requires a new form of cooperation. A large\r\nnumber of people have been affected, sometimes in\r\nneighbouring countries, and the enormous economic\r\nimpact will for decades place a burden on the affected\r\ncommunities. In addition to the now-past acute emergency\r\nneeds, long-term health consequences are starting to\r\nappear. Because of their scope and magnitude, such\r\ndisasters require an innovative and multi-disciplinary\r\napproach — hence the need for close cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the various technical, scientific and\r\nhumanitarian agencies involved. Long-term commitment\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nof donors is needed, and the Federation actively lobbies for\r\nthis. Throughout the process, from relief to rehabilitation,\r\nthe Federation is committed to keeping humanitarian needs\r\non the agenda as well as advocating economic and technical\r\nsolutions.\r\nWe believe that the most effective way to ensure the\r\nsuccess of such a programme is to involve the affected\r\ncommunities in both its planning and development. In this\r\nregard, the Federation is advocating an increasing\r\nmobilization of local resources, as external support will, we\r\nare fully aware, progressively phase out.\r\nIf we move to a more recent crisis, the joint\r\nInternational Federation-North Korean Red Cross relief\r\noperation demonstrates the effectiveness of coordination\r\nbetween independent humanitarian organizations and the\r\nvalue of promoting understanding and cooperation between\r\nindependent organizations and affected national\r\nGovernments. Our relief operation, which began in the\r\nautumn of 1995, entered a new phase as of July of this\r\nyear, when it was expanded to provide health and\r\nnutritional support to some 2.6 million people in the\r\ncountry. The current operation provides food aid to the\r\nmost vulnerable people and assistance to the country\u0027s\r\nfailing health sector. The latter is a role which will grow as\r\nother agencies, notably the World Food Programme,\r\nbecome more active in the food sector.\r\nOn the other side of the world, our operations in the\r\nGreat Lakes area of Africa demonstrate the value of a\r\nregional approach, linking local Red Cross societies in the\r\nregion and linking relief to disaster preparedness and\r\ncommunity development. The enormous population\r\nmovements following the 1994 Rwanda massacres have\r\ndeeply affected all countries in the Great Lakes region,\r\neither by forcing them to care for hundreds of thousands of\r\nrefugees or by fuelling existing conflicts.\r\nThe National Societies of the Great Lakes countries,\r\nwith the support of their Federation, have made tremendous\r\nefforts to support their local communities and authorities in\r\ncoping with this crisis. In the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and in Tanzania, Red Cross Societies have taken\r\ncare of hundreds of thousands of refugees in the Goma,\r\nBukavu and Ngara camps. In Rwanda, a rebuilt National\r\nSociety gives support to large groups of fellow citizens who\r\nhave managed to escape death during the massacres. In\r\nUganda, the National Society assists Rwandan refugees.\r\nFrom the beginning, the Societies of the region and the\r\nFederation had committed themselves to continue their\r\nsupport beyond the emergency situation.\r\nIn conclusion, for the Federation, our modus\r\noperandi is always to provide assistance through our local\r\nmembership, using the opportunity of relief programmes\r\nto upgrade skills, pass on knowledge and promote a\r\nconcern for issues of development and conflict mitigation.\r\nBetter and more universal standards in assistance, the\r\nexploring of new relationships between independent\r\nagencies and Governments, and close cooperation with\r\nUnited Nations organizations are all of vital concern to\r\nus.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with the\r\ndecision taken earlier at this meeting, I call now on the\r\nobserver of Switzerland.\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The Swiss delegation is grateful for this\r\nopportunity to address the item on the coordination of\r\nhumanitarian activities, a matter to which my Government\r\nattaches great importance.\r\nI wish first to express our satisfaction at the recent\r\nappointment of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello as United\r\nNations Emergency Relief Coordinator, an excellent\r\nchoice by which the Secretary-General is sending a very\r\nclear signal to the international community about the\r\nimportance he attaches to the new Office of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator.\r\nSwitzerland believes that humanitarian coordination\r\nshould be a priority for the new Coordinator\u0027s Office, and\r\nin that connection we should like to draw attention to four\r\npoints. First, humanitarian coordination involves two\r\nelements: the Emergency Relief Coordinator has the duty\r\nto meet the coordination needs both of the international\r\nhumanitarian community and of field operations, and he\r\nmust also ensure optimal coordination within the United\r\nNations system by taking into account the political,\r\nmilitary and development aspects of humanitarian\r\nactivities. The structure of the Office of the Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator will have to reflect the need to carry\r\nout these two tasks with a view to ensuring the optimal\r\nfunctioning of humanitarian coordination.\r\nSecondly, the machinery for the dissemination of\r\ninformation and for decision-making in the area of\r\nhumanitarian coordination must operate as effectively as\r\npossible. The Secretary-General\u0027s decision to strengthen\r\nthe Inter-Agency Standing Committee as the main\r\nconsultative — and, we hope, decision-making — body\r\nis certainly a major step in that direction. But we fear that\r\ncentralizing activities in the Office of the Emergency\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 November 1997\r\nRelief Coordinator could create too wide a gap between the\r\nmachinery for the dissemination of information and for\r\ndecision-making on the one hand and the main\r\nhumanitarian agencies operating in Europe on the other.\r\nHere, it is essential to ensure that the future structure makes\r\nthe best possible use of the respective advantages of each\r\nof the United Nations headquarters sites. Specifically, we\r\nmust maintain the complementarity and coherence between\r\nNew York\u0027s responsibility for political and military affairs\r\nand Geneva\u0027s responsibility for interagency operational\r\nquestions in the humanitarian sphere. The same is true for\r\nthe process of consolidated interagency appeals for funds.\r\nThirdly, in keeping with the logic of reform of the\r\nhumanitarian sector, the transfer to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme of responsibility for training in\r\ndisaster prevention and management should include only the\r\noperational aspects of these responsibilities. The actual\r\ncoordination of the management of disaster response should\r\nremain among the functions of the Office of the Emergency\r\nRelief Coordinator, in accordance with resolution 48/162.\r\nWe consider that, for reasons of efficiency and with a view\r\nto achieving synergy, these functions should remain close\r\nto the agencies and organizations with the operational\r\nmandates for humanitarian protection and relief, especially\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement and\r\nthe large number of relevant non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nFinally, we think that the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nrecommendation that a humanitarian-affairs segment be\r\nestablished within the Economic and Social Council is a\r\nfirst, positive step towards better “governance” in the\r\nhumanitarian sphere. For its part, Switzerland is interested\r\nin participating in future discussions on the modalities of\r\nsuch a segment and indeed in participating in a governance\r\nbody such as that suggested by the Secretary-General.\r\nI wish now to mention a problem that concerns us all:\r\nthe precarious security situation of humanitarian personnel\r\nin the field. The increasing number of serious incidents,\r\neven deliberate attacks aimed at humanitarian personnel, is\r\nintolerable. In our view, the international community must\r\nconsider the best way to promote the safety of those who\r\nare committed to helping those who are most in need. As\r\nthe depositary of the Geneva Conventions, Switzerland feels\r\nit bears a special responsibility with respect to the\r\nimplementation of international humanitarian law. Thus, it\r\ngladly accepted the mandate of the twenty-sixth\r\nInternational Conference of the Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent to organize periodic meetings to consider general\r\nproblems of implementing international humanitarian law,\r\nand is pleased that the safety of humanitarian personnel\r\nwill be a principal item on the agenda of the first of these\r\nmeetings. We hope that all the States parties to the\r\nGeneva Conventions will participate actively in the\r\nmeeting, which will be held at Geneva in January 1998.\r\nI wish in conclusion to reaffirm the support of\r\nSwitzerland for the Secretary-General\u0027s recent decisions\r\nin the humanitarian sphere, and for the new Office of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator, with which we expect to\r\nwork very productively.\r\nThe Acting President: Action on the draft\r\nresolutions already submitted under this item, and on\r\nthose to be submitted, will be taken at a later date to be\r\nannounced.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.10 p.m.\r\n35\r\n"
