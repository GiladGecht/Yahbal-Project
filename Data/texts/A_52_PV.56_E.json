(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 16 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other\r\nelections\r\n(a) Election of twenty-nine members of the Governing\r\nCouncil of the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme\r\nThe President: Pursuant to General Assembly\r\ndecision 43/406, the Assembly will proceed to the election\r\nof 29 members of the Governing Council of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme, to replace those members\r\nwhose term of office expires on 31 December 1997.\r\nThe 29 outgoing members are: Argentina, Brazil,\r\nBulgaria, Burundi, Canada, China, Costa Rica, the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, France, Gabon, the Gambia,\r\nGermany, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, Indonesia, Japan,\r\nNicaragua, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation,\r\nSpain, the Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic, the United States of America, Venezuela, Zambia\r\nand Zimbabwe.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that after 1 January\r\n1998 the following States will still be members of the\r\nGoverning Council: Algeria, Australia, Benin, Burkina\r\nFaso, the Central African Republic, Chile, Colombia, the\r\nCzech Republic, Finland, India, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, Italy, Kenya, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mexico,\r\nMorocco, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, the\r\nPhilippines, Poland, Samoa, Slovakia, Thailand, Tunisia,\r\nTurkey, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\nTherefore, those 29 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nAs members know, in accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure,\r\n“All elections shall be held by secret ballot.\r\nThere shall be no nominations.”\r\nHowever, I should like to recall paragraph 16 of\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, whereby the practice\r\nof dispensing with the secret ballot for elections to\r\nsubsidiary organs when the number of candidates\r\ncorresponds to the number of seats to be filled should\r\nbecome standard, unless a delegation specifically requests\r\na vote on a given election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that\r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on that\r\nbasis?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nThe President: Regarding candidatures, I have been\r\ninformed by the Chairmen of the regional groups that for\r\nthe eight seats from the African States, the endorsed\r\ncandidates are: Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Comoros,\r\nMalawi, Nigeria, Sudan and Zimbabwe.\r\nFor the six seats from the Asian States, the endorsed\r\ncandidates are: China, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan,\r\nRepublic of Korea and Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nAs for the three seats from the Eastern European\r\nStates, the three endorsed candidates are: Belarus, Hungary\r\nand Russian Federation.\r\nFor the Latin American and Caribbean States, the five\r\nendorsed candidates for the five seats are: Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, Argentina, Cuba, Jamaica and Venezuela.\r\nFor the seven seats from the Western European and\r\nother States, the seven endorsed candidates are: Austria,\r\nBelgium, Canada, France, Germany, Norway and the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nSince the number of candidates endorsed by the\r\nAfrican States, the Asian States, the Eastern European\r\nStates, the Latin American and Caribbean States and the\r\nWestern European and other States corresponds to the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled in each region, may I take it\r\nthat the General Assembly decides to elect those candidates\r\nas members of the Governing Council of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme for a four-year term\r\nbeginning on 1 January 1998?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States which have\r\nbeen elected members of the Governing Council of the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme.\r\nThis concludes our consideration of sub-item (a) of\r\nagenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 46 (continued)\r\nImplementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/305)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.25)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the General\r\nAssembly concluded the debate on this item at its 34th\r\nplenary meeting, on 17 October.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of Chile to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.25.\r\nMr. Larraín (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI am very pleased to introduce the draft resolution entitled\r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development” under agenda item 46 to the General\r\nAssembly on behalf of the 116 sponsors. In addition to\r\nthe countries referred to in document A/52/L.25, the\r\nsponsors include: Azerbaijan, Benin, Botswana, Cyprus,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, Honduras, India, Kazakhstan, Liberia,\r\nLiechtenstein, Madagascar, Maldives, Mauritius, Papua\r\nNew Guinea, Saint Lucia, San Marino, Tajikistan,\r\nThailand, Tunisia and Ukraine.\r\nThis draft resolution reaffirms the commitments\r\nundertaken by heads of State and Government at the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and their pledge\r\nto give the highest priority to national, regional and\r\ninternational policies and actions for the promotion of\r\nsocial progress, social justice, the betterment of the\r\nhuman condition and social integration on the basis of full\r\nparticipation by all. It also highlights the need to create a\r\nframework for action to place people at the very centre of\r\ndevelopment and to direct economies to meet human\r\nneeds more effectively.\r\nGiven the critical importance of national action and\r\ninternational cooperation for social development, emphasis\r\nis placed on the fundamental responsibility of\r\nGovernments and the fundamental nature of cooperation\r\nand assistance at the international level for the full\r\nimplementation of the Social Summit’s Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nThis draft resolution, while highlighting solidarity\r\nwith people living in poverty, emphasizes the central role\r\nof full employment in the drafting of policies and\r\nhighlights social integration as one of the aims and\r\nobjectives set by Governments. It includes an appeal for\r\nthe promotion of an active and visible policy of\r\nmainstreaming a gender perspective.\r\nSimilarly, it is recognized that implementation of the\r\nSummit’s Declaration and Programme of Action will\r\nrequire the mobilization of financial resources at the\r\nnational and international levels and that the specific\r\ncases of Africa and the least developed countries will\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nneed additional resources and more effective development\r\ncooperation and assistance.\r\nEmphasis is also placed on the importance of the\r\nparticipation of civil society and other actors in the\r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the commitments of the\r\nSocial Summit, as well as in the planning, elaboration,\r\nimplementation and evaluation of social policies at the\r\nnational level.\r\nRegarding the role of the United Nations system,\r\nspecial emphasis is placed on the primary responsibility of\r\nthe Commission for Social Development for the follow-up\r\nto and review of the implementation of the outcome of the\r\nSummit. The text also welcomes the role, in this respect, of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies\r\nand highlights the resolutions of the Council on the\r\neradication of poverty and on integrated and coordinated\r\nimplementation and follow-up of the major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits. It also highlights the decision to\r\nhold a session of the Council in 1998 to consider further\r\nthis subject and to hold in 1999 an overall review of the\r\nquestion of poverty eradication, as a contribution to the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly in the year 2000\r\nfor a general review of the Summit.\r\nIt stresses, in particular, the work to be done by\r\nregional commissions in considering and analyzing the\r\noutcome of the Summit, as well as the efforts and\r\ncontributions of the funds and programmes of the United\r\nNations Development Programme and the International\r\nLabour Organization.\r\nVery clearly, this draft resolution adopts the decisions\r\nand provisions needed to ensure appropriate preparation for\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly in the year\r\n2000, which will carry out an overall review and appraisal\r\nof the implementation of the outcome of the Summit and\r\nconsider further actions and initiatives. In this respect, it\r\ndecides to establish an open-ended Preparatory Committee\r\nof the General Assembly that will hold an organizational\r\nsession of four days’ duration from 19 to 22 May 1998, and\r\nreaffirms that the Committee will initiate its substantive\r\nactivities in 1999 on the basis of input by the Commission\r\nfor Social Development and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and that account will be taken of contributions by\r\nall relevant organs and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nFinally, the text reaffirms that the follow-up to the\r\nSummit will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated\r\napproach to social development and within the framework\r\nof a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the\r\nresults of the major international conferences in the\r\neconomic and social fields, and requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to ensure that the preparatory process for the\r\nspecial session benefits from the active involvement of all\r\nconcerned and that the Secretariat is adequately supported\r\nso that it can assist in this process.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like in particular to\r\nhighlight and express our appreciation for the excellent\r\nwork of the Counsellor of the Brazilian delegation,\r\nMs. Marcela Nicodemos, who headed the informal\r\nconsultations that led to this draft resolution with\r\nefficiency and promptness.\r\nWe reiterate the determination of the Government of\r\nChile to continue to promote the follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the commitments of the Social Summit\r\nat all levels, and, in particular, in the context of\r\npreparations for the special session of the General\r\nAssembly in 2000.\r\nMy delegation hopes that, as in previous years, this\r\nresolution will be adopted by consensus at this General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Jin Yongjian (Under-Secretary-General for\r\nGeneral Assembly Affairs and Conference Services): I\r\nshould like to inform members that under the terms of\r\noperative paragraph 51 of draft resolution A/52/L.25, on\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, the General Assembly would\r\ndecide to establish a preparatory committee open to the\r\nparticipation of all States Members of the United Nations\r\nand members of the specialized agencies, with the\r\nparticipation of observers in accordance with the\r\nestablished practice of the General Assembly, and that the\r\npreparatory committee would hold an organizational\r\nsession of four days’ duration, from 19 to 22 May 1998.\r\nIt is anticipated that there would be two meetings\r\nper day, for a total of eight meetings, with interpretation\r\nservices in all six official languages. The volume of\r\ndocumentation for the session is anticipated at 110 pages,\r\nto be processed in all six official languages. The\r\nconference servicing requirements for the four-day\r\norganizational session in 1998 are estimated, at full cost,\r\nat an amount of $157,700.\r\nThe extent to which the Organization’s permanent\r\ncapacity would need to be supplemented by temporary\r\nassistance resources can be determined in the light of the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\ncalendar of conferences and meetings for the biennium\r\n1998-1999. However, provision is made under section 27E\r\non “Conference services” of the proposed programme\r\nbudget for the biennium 1998-1999 not only for meetings\r\nprogrammed at the time of budget preparation, but also for\r\nmeetings authorized subsequently, provided that the number\r\nand distribution of meetings are consistent with the pattern\r\nof meetings in past years.\r\nConsequently, should the General Assembly decide to\r\nadopt the draft resolution, no additional resources would be\r\nrequired beyond those already planned for inclusion in the\r\nproposed programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999,\r\nunder section 27E.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/52/L.25.\r\nI should like to announce that since the introduction of\r\nthe draft resolution, Ethiopia has become a sponsor.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.25 without a vote?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.25 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/25).\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 46?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 39\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\n(a) Law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/52/487,\r\nA/52/491)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/52/260)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/52/L.26, A/52/L.27)\r\n(b) Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/555)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.29)\r\n(c) Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized\r\nfishing in zones of national jurisdiction and\r\nfisheries by-catch and discards\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/557)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.30)\r\nThe President: I wish to recall that on 10\r\nDecember, the international community will mark the\r\nfifteenth anniversary of the signing of the 1982 United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which laid\r\ndown a comprehensive programme of law and order in\r\nthe world’s oceans and seas, thus providing the legal\r\nframework and detailed rules to govern all ocean uses and\r\naccess to their resources.\r\n1997 will be recorded as the year when the\r\nformation of all three bodies mandated by the Convention\r\nwas completed. With the creation of the Commission on\r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf, the world community\r\nreceived the full set of tools for the effective\r\nimplementation of the Convention’s provisions.\r\nAs I open this agenda item, I would like to point out\r\nthat at the present session of the General Assembly, the\r\nitem on the law of the sea has been significantly\r\nexpanded. It now includes all ocean issues. The wider\r\nmandate is evidence of the importance attached by\r\nMember States to the presentation of a global overview of\r\nthese issues to the General Assembly. Indeed, the General\r\nAssembly is the only global institution with the\r\ncompetence to conduct such a comprehensive annual\r\nreview.\r\nI suggest that our discussion not be limited to the\r\nnormative aspect of the instruments pertaining to the law\r\nof the sea and their positive contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In view\r\nof the ongoing process of United Nations reform, and\r\nconsidering the growing support for the new role of the\r\nOrganization in addressing development issues, the time\r\nis ripe to focus on those aspects of the Convention that\r\nprovide important means to promote the economic and\r\nsocial development of States as well as global\r\nenvironmental protection. Therefore I encourage all the\r\ndelegates to engage in action-oriented dialogue in this\r\nforum.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nFinally, I wish to inform delegates that because of the\r\nongoing hearings in Hamburg in the first case to be brought\r\nbefore the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\nupon the application of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nneither the President of the Tribunal, Mr. Thomas A.\r\nMensah, nor the Tribunal Registrar, Mr. Gritakumar E.\r\nChitty, was able to come to New York to make a statement\r\nin the General Assembly on behalf of the Tribunal.\r\nNevertheless, the text of a statement was recently received,\r\nand copies of it will be made available by the Secretariat.\r\nI now call on the representative of New Zealand to\r\nintroduce draft resolutions A/52/L.26 and A/52/L.27.\r\nMs. Wong (New Zealand): I have the honour to take\r\nthe floor, as coordinator, to introduce agenda item 39, on\r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”. The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport (A/52/487) notes that there are now 120 parties to\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nthat the establishment of the institutions created under the\r\nConvention is now complete.\r\nOf the four draft resolutions before us, draft\r\nresolutions A/52/L.29 and A/52/L.30, concerning fisheries,\r\nwill be introduced by the next speaker, the representative of\r\nthe United States.\r\nThere are additional sponsors of draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.26, as follows: Austria, China, Croatia, Guinea-\r\nBissau, India, Italy, Malaysia, Malta, Mozambique,\r\nMyanmar, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa,\r\nSweden, Trinidad and Tobago and Ukraine.\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.26 was the result of a series\r\nof open-ended consultations among delegations. Its focus is\r\nto recall certain important aspects of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and to express the\r\ninternational community’s welcoming the increasing number\r\nof States parties to the Convention, while encouraging\r\nfurther States to become parties.\r\nThe draft resolution responds to the information in the\r\nSecretary General’s report concerning declarations and\r\nstatements made under article 310. Since declarations and\r\nstatements should not purport to exclude or modify the\r\nlegal effect of the provisions of the Convention, the draft\r\nresolution calls upon States to examine their declarations\r\nand withdraw any that are not in conformity with the\r\nConvention.\r\nThe next Meeting of States Parties to the Convention\r\nwill be held from 18 to 22 May 1998, with the Commission\r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf set to continue the\r\nwork initiated after the election of its members earlier this\r\nyear, at meetings in May and August next year. The\r\nCommission’s work on finalizing its rules of procedure is\r\nwell advanced.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe draft resolution welcomes the progress made by\r\nthe new institutions of the Convention: the International\r\nSeabed Authority in Kingston, Jamaica, and the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg,\r\nGermany. This past year has seen the Seabed Authority\r\napprove seven plans of work for exploration in the Area,\r\nand achieve advances in the drafting of the Mining Code.\r\nDuring the year, States parties adopted the Agreement on\r\nthe Privileges and Immunities of the Tribunal, and the\r\nTribunal itself made progress in concluding a\r\nHeadquarters Agreement, while adopting its rules of\r\nprocedure, a resolution on Internal Judicial Practice and\r\nthe Guidelines to assist parties. Many involved in the\r\nestablishment of this new institution for the settlement of\r\ndisputes welcomed the news that the Tribunal had before\r\nit its first application instituting a case before the\r\nTribunal.\r\nThe draft resolution also recalls the comprehensive\r\ndispute settlement system established in part XV of the\r\nConvention and encourages States parties to consider\r\nmaking a declaration choosing from the means of\r\nsettlement of disputes set out in article 287. It also recalls\r\nthe provisions concerning arbitrators and conciliators.\r\nIn the context of the focus on reform at this General\r\nAssembly session, it is timely to restate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s responsibilities and underline how important\r\nthese continue to be to Member States in this area. The\r\ndraft resolution underpins the Secretary-General’s special\r\nresponsibilities under the Convention by focusing on the\r\nmandate for the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law\r\nof the Sea.\r\nThe draft resolution highlights the importance of his\r\nrole in producing the annual comprehensive report and\r\nspecial reports, and in this regard a new reference is made\r\nto the transit problems of landlocked developing States.\r\nThe text notes the Secretary-General’s responsibilities to\r\nprovide facilities for depositing charts, disseminating\r\ninformation, encouraging better understanding of the\r\nConvention, responding to requests from States, preparing\r\nmeetings, and assisting with training. Member States are\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\ninvited to contribute to the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe\r\nMemorial Fellowship Programme.\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.26 notes the decision taken at\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly held earlier\r\nthis year for the Commission on Sustainable Development\r\nto undertake periodic reviews of all aspects of the marine\r\nenvironment. The first such review will take place in 1999.\r\nThe special session identified an urgent need for action,\r\nspecifically in relation to fisheries, given the decline in\r\nmany fish stocks and the high levels of discards and rising\r\nmarine pollution. The draft resolution calls on States to\r\nimplement resolution 51/189 and strengthen agreements\r\naimed at combating marine pollution.\r\nNext year will be the International Year of the Ocean.\r\nIt will be an important time to reflect on the further\r\nconcrete action the international community must take on\r\noceans and the law of the sea, and we expect to have\r\nbefore us a report from the Independent World Commission\r\non the Oceans.\r\nThe Secretary-General highlighted the need for a\r\ncomprehensive and coordinated approach at the global\r\nlevel. This General Assembly debate provides such an\r\nimportant forum, but we need to find ways to involve\r\nrepresentatives of non-governmental organizations in our\r\nwork.\r\nThere are additional sponsors to the second draft\r\nresolution before us (A/52/L.27): Argentina, Austria, China,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, India, Italy, Malaysia, Malta, South Africa\r\nand Trinidad and Tobago. Draft resolution A/52/L.27 is a\r\nhousekeeping draft resolution approving the Agreement\r\nconcerning the Relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the International Seabed Authority. The Relationship\r\nAgreement establishes a framework for cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Seabed Authority on\r\nadministrative and technical-support matters, such as\r\nexchange of personnel, servicing of meetings, translation of\r\ndocuments and interpretation, relationship with the United\r\nNations Joint Staff Pension Fund, facilitation of a health-\r\ninsurance scheme, use of the International Civil Service\r\nCommission and common staff terms and conditions.\r\nFor the information of delegations, agenda item 39\r\nwill remain open at the end of our action today, so that in\r\nthe new year the Relationship Agreement currently being\r\nconcluded between the United Nations and the Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea can be considered and approved.\r\nWhile I commend draft resolution A/52/L.27 to\r\nmembers to be adopted by consensus, it is unfortunate\r\nthat it has become usual practice for a delegation to\r\nrequest a recorded vote on draft resolutions such as\r\nA/52/L.26. If there is a collective process which can be\r\ninitiated to avoid this outcome next year, my delegation\r\nwould support that effort wholeheartedly on such an\r\nimportant draft resolution.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the representative of the United States of\r\nAmerica to introduce draft resolutions A/52/L.29 and\r\nA/52/L.30.\r\nMr. Spitzer (United States of America): The\r\ndelegation of the United States has the honour to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/52/L.29, entitled “Agreement\r\nfor the Implementation of the Provisions of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10\r\nDecember 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks”, and draft resolution A/52/L.30,\r\nentitled “Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing:\r\nunauthorized fishing in zones of national jurisdiction and\r\non the high seas; fisheries by-catch and discards; and\r\nother developments”.\r\nOnce again, we would like to extend our gratitude to\r\nall those delegations that offered valuable suggestions and\r\nworked in a spirit of cooperation to draft these two texts.\r\nWe expect, as in the case of draft resolutions in years\r\npast, that draft resolutions A/52/L.29 and A/52/L.30 will\r\nbe adopted by consensus.\r\nI am pleased to announce at this time as additional\r\nsponsors the following States: for draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.29; Argentina, Brazil, Iceland, Malaysia, Samoa,\r\nSolomon Islands and Ukraine; for draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.30, Argentina, Brazil, the Philippines, Samoa and\r\nSolomon Islands.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the\r\nlong-standing support of the United States for the 1982\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which\r\nnow has been ratified by 122 States. This Convention is\r\none of the most ambitious and complex treaties ever\r\nconcluded under the auspices of the United Nations, and\r\nthough we have not yet acceded to its provisions\r\nformally, it serves as the basis on which United States\r\nocean policy is formulated and carried out.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nThe United States supports the Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea as modified by the 1994 Agreement and is\r\nworking to achieve the necessary advice and consent of the\r\nUnited States Senate. The Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea is a signal achievement, and it is our hope that in the\r\nnot-too-distant future the United States will join with the\r\nrest of the world in formally embracing this Convention\r\nand the 1994 Agreement.\r\nIn the last year the parties to the Convention have\r\nmade enormous strides in establishing three of the\r\ninstitutions called for in the Convention. Those\r\norganizations — the International Seabed Authority, the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf — are\r\nnow in operation. All have begun to undertake their\r\nresponsibilities while keeping in mind the importance of a\r\ncost-effective and evolutionary approach. We must continue\r\nto work to ensure the integrity of these institutions so that\r\ntheir credibility will redound to the benefit of the entire\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe believe that as confidence builds in the law-of-the-\r\nsea regime that we have worked so hard to achieve, States\r\nwill begin to review the considerable number of\r\ndeclarations or statements made upon signing, ratifying or\r\nacceding to the Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is our\r\nhope that many of these declarations and statements which\r\nare not in conformity with the Convention will be\r\nwithdrawn.\r\nArticle 310 provides that a State may make\r\ndeclarations or statements when signing, ratifying or\r\nacceding, provided they are not reservations. Those\r\nstatements or declarations cannot purport to exclude or\r\nmodify the legal effect of the provisions of the Convention\r\nin their application to that State. Article 309 of the\r\nConvention prohibits reservations, except where expressly\r\npermitted by other articles.\r\nDeclarations and statements not in conformity with\r\narticles 309 and 310 include, among others, first, those\r\nwhich relate to baselines not drawn in conformity with the\r\nConvention; secondly, those which purport to require\r\nnotification or permission before warships or other ships\r\nexercise the right of innocent passage; thirdly, those which\r\nare not in conformity with the provisions of the Convention\r\nrelating to straits used for international navigation,\r\nincluding the right of transit passage; fourthly, those which\r\nare not in conformity with the provisions relating to\r\narchipelagic States’ waters, including archipelagic baselines\r\nand archipelagic sea-lane passage; fifthly, those which are\r\nnot in conformity with the provisions of the Convention\r\nrelating to the exclusive economic zone or the continental\r\nshelf; sixthly, those not in conformity with provisions of\r\nthe Convention relating to delimitation; and, lastly, those\r\nwhich purport to subordinate the interpretation or\r\napplication of the Convention to national laws and\r\nregulations, including constitutional provisions.\r\nWe note with regret that the threat of piracy and\r\narmed robbery against ships, ship owners, seafarers and\r\ntheir economies has unfortunately become a real and\r\nsubstantial problem demanding proactive responses. The\r\nUnited States urges all States to become parties to the\r\nmaritime terrorism convention and its related protocol by\r\nthe year 2000.\r\nWe are pleased to see that all law-of-the-sea and\r\nocean issues, including those of the marine environment\r\nand fisheries, which are on the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly are being taken up under a single, unified\r\nagenda item rather than being dealt with in piecemeal\r\nfashion. The United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development at Rio de Janeiro, as well as the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, endorsed\r\nrecommendations that there be an annual overview of\r\noceans issues in the General Assembly. We are therefore\r\nvery optimistic that such an overall review will allow\r\nStates to gain a greater understanding of the\r\ninterdependence of these issues, make valuable linkages\r\nand avoid duplication. In this regard, we welcome the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General and the valuable work of\r\nthe Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea as\r\nit continues to keep the Assembly apprised of all ocean-\r\nrelated activities.\r\nWe continue to believe that a more concerted effort\r\nmust be undertaken by States within appropriate United\r\nNations bodies to give full force and effect to the 1995\r\nGlobal Programme of Action for the Protection of the\r\nMarine Environment from Land-based Activities, and we\r\nwelcome the language in the draft resolution on this topic.\r\nThe United States considers the Global Programme of\r\nAction a major contribution to international efforts to\r\nimplement the recommendations of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development. We also\r\nlook forward to continued steady progress on the\r\nprotection of the marine environment.\r\nFor this to occur, it is incumbent upon States to take\r\naction within their member organizations to ensure that\r\nthe cooperation required to establish a clearing-house\r\nmechanism, as well as to implement other aspects of the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nGlobal Programme of Action, are accorded high priority\r\nwithin those institutions. We believe that such a priority can\r\nbe accommodated within existing resources, as the expertise\r\nrequired to implement the Global Programme of Action,\r\nparticularly the clearing-house mechanism, already exists.\r\nThe United States actively supports the establishment of a\r\nmechanism that would allow developed and developing\r\ncountries to share information on numerous land-based\r\nactivities, such as sewage and waste water, heavy metals,\r\nnutrients and sediments.\r\nI would also like to address the progress that the\r\ninternational community has made with regard to the\r\nconservation and management of the world’s fishery\r\nresources. To date, 15 nations have deposited instruments\r\nof ratification to the Agreement for the conservation and\r\nmanagement of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory\r\nfish stocks. This represents half the number of instruments\r\nof ratification needed to bring the Agreement into force.\r\nWe fully support the Agreement because it builds upon the\r\nconservation and management concepts established in the\r\nConvention, and it gives form and substance to the\r\nConvention’s mandate for States to cooperate in conserving\r\nand managing straddling and highly migratory fish stocks.\r\nWe applaud the United Nations call for those members of\r\nthe international community that have not done so to ratify\r\nthe Agreement and to deposit their instruments of\r\nratification.\r\nAlthough the Agreement is not yet in force, we are\r\npleased that many Governments and regional fisheries\r\nbodies are moving in the direction of implementing some\r\nof the Agreement’s key provisions. Among others, we note\r\nefforts to improve transparency, to implement a\r\nprecautionary approach and to improve compliance by\r\nmembers and non-members. We also welcome ongoing\r\nefforts to establish new regional fisheries bodies in the\r\nsouth-east Atlantic and in the central and western Pacific in\r\norder to manage more effectively the fishery resources\r\nfound in these areas. Moreover, we are pleased that these\r\nefforts are, to a large degree, based upon the provisions\r\ncontained in the Agreement.\r\nWe are disappointed, however, with the progress made\r\nthus far in bringing into force the Agreement to Promote\r\nCompliance with International Conservation and\r\nManagement Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High\r\nSeas. This Agreement was adopted in 1993 and requires the\r\ndeposit of 25 instruments of acceptance to come into force.\r\nThus far, only 10 such instruments have been deposited.\r\nWe believe that the Compliance Agreement, the United\r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement and the Code of Conduct\r\nfor Responsible Fisheries complement each other and\r\nprovide the cornerstones to ensure sustainable fisheries. In\r\nshort, it will be important for the international community\r\nto find the means to bring the Compliance Agreement\r\ninto force.\r\nMy Government also calls upon all members of the\r\ninternational community to continue to abide by the\r\nUnited Nations moratorium on large-scale drift-net fishing\r\non the high seas and to take prompt and effective\r\nenforcement action against violators of the moratorium.\r\nSuch action should, in our view, include the confiscation\r\nand destruction of large scale drift-nets and the imposition\r\nof penalties sufficient to deter such violations in the\r\nfuture.\r\nFinally, we welcome the efforts being undertaken\r\nthrough the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations with respect to reducing the incidental\r\ncapture of seabirds in longline fisheries, promoting the\r\nconservation and management of sharks and managing\r\nfishing capacity. These efforts reflect the international\r\ncommunity’s recognition that responsible fisheries\r\nmanagement calls for awareness and appropriate action on\r\nthese important topics, and we believe that the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization is the appropriate international\r\nforum to address these issues.\r\nIn summary, the United States objectives continue to\r\nbe promotion of widespread adherence to and\r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Law of the Sea\r\nConvention and the 1994 Agreement; implementation of\r\nthe Convention and the Agreement in a cost-effective\r\nmanner, with budgets held to the minimum; the entry into\r\nforce of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement and\r\nthe Compliance Agreement; and provision for an annual\r\noverview of ocean issues in the General Assembly under\r\na single agenda item.\r\nMrs. Lucas (Luxembourg) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of\r\nthe European Union. The Central and Eastern European\r\ncountries associated with the European Union —\r\nBulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania,\r\nRomania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the associated\r\ncountry Cyprus align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea is the cornerstone of the United Nations efforts to\r\nsolve problems related to the oceans. In recent years, we\r\nhave seen the number of States that have ratified the\r\nConvention rise to 122, and I am happy to note that the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nmajority of the European Union member States have by\r\nnow ratified or acceded to it. The preparation of the\r\nparticipation by the European Communities is now in its\r\nfinal stage.\r\nGiven the importance of the Convention for the\r\nmanagement of the world’s oceans, universal acceptance of\r\nthis instrument is important. This includes universal\r\nadherence to the Agreement relating to the implementation\r\nof Part XI of the Convention. The Agreement has facilitated\r\nthe growth of the number of parties to the Convention and\r\nhas been the key to universal participation in the organs\r\ncreated by the Convention.\r\nToday, a number of States that have ratified the\r\nConvention have not yet taken the step of adhering to the\r\nAgreement. So far, a pragmatic approach has been adopted\r\nthat has allowed practical difficulties to be avoided. We call\r\nupon those States to make the required effort to ratify the\r\nAgreement as well. It is important that all States work to\r\nestablish a uniform and coherent body of law for the oceans\r\nand that they be parties to both the Convention and the\r\nAgreement.\r\nThe universal acceptance of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea should, however, not\r\ntake place at the expense of its integrity. The European\r\nUnion notes with concern that, in spite of the provisions of\r\narticle 310 of the Convention, a number of States have\r\nmade declarations that appear to exclude or modify the\r\nlegal effect of certain provisions of the Convention. As the\r\nConvention clearly states in article 309 that reservations\r\nmay not be made, such declarations cannot have any legal\r\neffect. In general, the European Union would like to\r\nobserve that the prohibition of reservations contained in\r\narticle 309 is not merely a restrictive rule; it is an essential\r\nsafeguard for maintaining the balance struck between the\r\nmultitude of interests covered by the Convention and the\r\nAgreement.\r\nOf equal concern are the rules of national law that\r\nappear to deviate from the rules set out in the Convention.\r\nA number of States have issued legislation that seems to\r\nrun contrary to the law of the sea and, indeed, to customary\r\nlaw. Let me note a few examples of assumptions that\r\nappear in national declarations and in legislation that are of\r\nconcern to us.\r\nThe European Union is concerned about claims that\r\nseem to limit the freedoms of the high seas, and in\r\nparticular the freedom of navigation, as well as the\r\nexclusive jurisdiction of the flag State. Similarly, an issue\r\nof concern is the fact that certain States have claimed\r\njurisdiction over straits, when such claims are\r\nincompatible with the rules of customary law or those laid\r\ndown in the Convention.\r\nUnfortunately, many more examples could be cited.\r\nWe would like to call upon all States to ensure that their\r\nlegislation and its implementation remain within the limits\r\nagreed to in the Convention and the Agreement. The\r\nEuropean Union wants to stress the need for a consistent\r\ninterpretation of the Convention’s rules. Not only is there\r\na general obligation under the law of treaties to interpret\r\nand apply a convention in good faith; it is also in the\r\ninterest of the world community at large to maintain a\r\nconsistent interpretation. Those States parties to the\r\nConvention that have made declarations or reservations\r\nnot in conformity with the Law of the Sea Convention\r\nshould reconsider these declarations or reservations with\r\na view to withdrawing them. Moreover, we would call\r\nupon the Secretary-General to include this issue in the\r\nnext report on the law of the sea to be prepared for the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nTurning back to the debate on the law of the sea in\r\nthis forum, the General Assembly, we wish to stress our\r\nattachment to a discussion of this important issue here.\r\nThe European Union considers the General Assembly to\r\nbe the place for a thorough debate on the basis of a\r\ncomprehensive report by the Secretary-General, with\r\npreparations for the debate being made in a working\r\ngroup reporting directly to the plenary. It would thus be\r\npossible to improve monitoring of the coherence and\r\nconsistency of the interpretation and development of the\r\nlaw of the sea in its many and varied aspects.\r\nWhile appreciating the broad scope of the report\r\npresented by the Secretariat, the European Union regrets\r\nits late distribution, which made it difficult to prepare\r\nadequately for the discussion of law of the sea matters.\r\nWe call upon the Secretary-General to issue the report for\r\nthe fifty-third session six weeks before the discussions in\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks\r\nand Highly Migratory Fish Stocks contains numerous\r\nelements for the effective implementation of the\r\nprovisions of the Convention related to fishing. The\r\nEuropean Community and its Member States signed this\r\nAgreement at the end of 1996. The procedure for the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nratification of the Agreement has begun at both local and\r\nnational levels within member States. We hope that this\r\nprocess can be concluded within a reasonable period of\r\ntime.\r\nThe European Union would like, finally, to express its\r\nsupport for the efforts made within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations to ensure better protection of the marine\r\nenvironment and biological diversity. It stresses the\r\nimportance it attaches to the Convention just when the\r\ninternational community is about to celebrate 1998 as the\r\nInternational Year of the Ocean, and when the main theme\r\nchosen for the last World’s Fair of the century, Expo ’98,\r\nto be held in Lisbon from 22 May to 30 September, is “The\r\nOceans, A Heritage for the Future”. In this context, it is\r\nworth recalling that the oceans will also be the main theme\r\nfor the activities in 1999 of the United Nations Commission\r\non Sustainable Development.\r\nMr. Tuerk (Austria): The seventh Meeting of States\r\nParties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea requested the President of the Meeting to attend the\r\nGeneral Assembly debate on the item “Oceans and the law\r\nof the sea” to inform it of the work carried out during that\r\nMeeting. Therefore, permit me, in my capacity as President\r\nof that Meeting, to report on the progress of work of the\r\nMeeting.\r\nFirst, I wish to inform the General Assembly of\r\ncertain developments relating to the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea. The seventh Meeting of States\r\nParties considered and approved the budget of the Tribunal\r\nfor the 1998 financial year. The draft budget submitted by\r\nthe Tribunal amounted to $7,779,061. After detailed\r\nconsideration, the budget was approved at a lower amount\r\nof $5,627,169, including $1,971,169 for the remuneration\r\nof the judges, $2,419,239 for salaries and related costs of\r\nthe staff of the Registry, and a non-recurrent expenditure of\r\n$140,000. It was also decided not to include a contingency\r\namount in the budget, as was done for the 1997 budget, and\r\nthat any costs for hearing a case in 1998 would have to be\r\ndefrayed from within existing resources. The budget of the\r\nTribunal, approved by the Meeting of States Parties for the\r\n1998 financial year, is contained in document SPLOS/L.7.\r\nAs regards the Agreement on the Privileges and\r\nImmunities of the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea, after consideration of the draft at several meetings in\r\na working group chaired by Mr. Martin Smejkal of the\r\nCzech Republic, the Agreement was finally adopted by the\r\nMeeting and was opened for signature on 1 July 1997. It\r\nwill stay open for signature at United Nations Headquarters\r\nfor 24 months. In adopting the Agreement, the Meeting of\r\nStates Parties included in its report a statement to the\r\neffect that on the question of insurance coverage for\r\nvehicles owned and operated by the Tribunal, its members\r\nand officials, States parties would not normally expect\r\nreliance to be placed on immunity in respect of claims for\r\ndamages arising from accidents involving such vehicles.\r\nOn the issuance of laissez-passer documents by the\r\nUnited Nations to the members and officials of the\r\nTribunal, the following understanding was reached:\r\nalthough their issuance by the United Nations would\r\nfacilitate the development of the Tribunal and promote\r\ncost-effectiveness, the Tribunal would retain its juridical\r\npersonality and capacities, as set out in the provisions of\r\nthe Convention and the Agreement. The Tribunal would\r\ntherefore retain the right to issue its own laissez-passer in\r\nthe future.\r\nThe Agreement is available in all languages in\r\ndocument SPLOS/25. I hope that States parties that have\r\nnot done so will sign it as soon as possible. This would\r\nenable it to enter into force early, thereby facilitating the\r\nwork of the Tribunal, its members and its officials. I have\r\nbeen informed that the Tribunal at its last session adopted\r\nits rules, a resolution on its internal judicial practice and\r\na set of guidelines concerning the preparation and\r\npresentation of a case before the Tribunal. In short, the\r\nTribunal has finished its judicial organization and is now\r\nfully equipped to receive and consider cases. I am\r\ntherefore happy to note that the Registrar of the Tribunal\r\nannounced on 13 November 1997 that it had received the\r\nfirst application instituting a case before it.\r\nI would now like to turn to developments relating to\r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf,\r\nwhich held its first session in June and its second session\r\nin September this year. The Commission has adopted its\r\nrules of procedure, and, bearing in mind the concerns\r\nexpressed during the seventh Meeting of States Parties, its\r\nmembers decided to simplify some of the rules contained\r\nin the first draft. The rules now also contain provisions\r\naddressing the protection of confidential and proprietary\r\ninformation, as well as provisions prohibiting the\r\ndisclosure of such information by the members of the\r\nCommission, both during and after their tenure in office.\r\nThe Commission also adopted its modus operandi,\r\nwhich describes what should be included in the\r\nsubmission of a coastal State and how it should be\r\npresented to and considered by the Commission.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nThe members of the Commission, however, were of\r\nthe opinion that a number of issues were of such\r\nimportance that they needed to be referred to the Meeting\r\nof States Parties. Among such issues was granting members\r\nimmunity from legal process in the performance of their\r\nfunctions, especially in regard to allegations of breach of\r\nconfidentiality. Another issue related to a submission by a\r\ncoastal State that might involve a dispute between States\r\nwith opposite or adjacent coasts, or other cases of\r\nunresolved land or maritime disputes. In this context, it\r\nshould be noted that views were expressed during the\r\nseventh Meeting of States Parties that the Commission was\r\nresponsible for drafting its rules of procedure. A third issue,\r\nin the light of article 4 of annex II to the Convention, was\r\nwhether the terms “a coastal State” and “a State” include a\r\nnon-State party to the Convention, or refer only to a coastal\r\nState or a State that is a State party to the Convention.\r\nAmong other issues that were dealt with at the seventh\r\nMeeting was the role of the Meeting of States parties in\r\nreviewing ocean and law of the sea issues. An opinion was\r\nexpressed that there is an interrelationship between the\r\ndiscussion of these matters at the Meeting of States parties\r\nand at the United Nations General Assembly.\r\nAs many representatives are aware, the General\r\nAssembly decided a few years ago to broaden the item now\r\nunder discussion, first to include the issues of fisheries, and\r\nthen to include ocean issues. Consequently the General\r\nAssembly is now in a position to review problems of ocean\r\nspace, which are closely interrelated and need to be\r\nconsidered as a whole. During the short deliberations at the\r\nseventh Meeting of States parties on this subject, the\r\nimportance of the General Assembly debate was\r\nemphasized. But opinions were also expressed that, as\r\nimportant as the discussion was in the General Assembly,\r\nthe review of ocean and law of the sea issues should be a\r\nregular item on the agenda of the Meeting of States parties.\r\nFurthermore, different views were also put forth\r\nregarding what such a review should consist of. They\r\nranged from assigning to the Meeting of States parties the\r\ntask of reviewing global ocean management in all its\r\naspects to merely requesting the Meeting to undertake a\r\nsimple review of ocean affairs and the law of the sea. In\r\nthis context, attention was also drawn to the related issue of\r\nthe role of the General Assembly as the global institution\r\noverseeing ocean affairs and the law of the sea, and the\r\nrelationship of such a role to that of States parties to the\r\nConvention.\r\nEmphasis was placed by several delegations on the\r\nneed to improve coordination among Secretariat units\r\ninvolved in maritime issues, as well as a need to\r\nstrengthen the overall coordination in relation to\r\ninstitutional responsibilities in marine affairs within the\r\nUnited Nations system. This subject was of particular\r\ninterest to the States parties, since the view was expressed\r\nthat many of the agencies were better equipped to handle\r\ntechnical rather than political aspects of ocean issues. A\r\nrequest was made to the Division for Ocean Affairs and\r\nthe Law of the Sea, Office of Legal Affairs, to keep the\r\nMeeting informed of the scope of the responsibilities of\r\nthe specialized agencies assigned to them under the\r\nConvention and the extent to which those responsibilities\r\nwere being discharged.\r\nMany delegations look forward each year to\r\ndiscussing the Law of the Sea item in the context of the\r\nannual report of the Secretary-General on this subject.\r\nBecause of the consolidated nature of the report and the\r\ncomprehensive information it contains, many delegations\r\nat the Meeting of States parties requested that the report\r\nshould not be subject to length restrictions and that it\r\nshould be made available to Governments at least one\r\nmonth before the General Assembly’s consideration of the\r\nitem. As President, I was then requested to address a\r\nletter to the Secretary-General to inform him of the\r\nwishes of the Meeting. I am grateful that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral acceded to those requests and that consequently\r\nthe report (A/52/487) was received by delegations earlier\r\nthan in previous years for the consideration of the item\r\nhere today, and that the document-length restrictions were\r\nnot imposed. It has also been brought to my attention that\r\nthe report is available on the Web site of the Division for\r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea on the Internet.\r\nI hope that the information I have provided on the\r\nwork of the seventh Meeting of States parties has enabled\r\ndelegations to be apprised of the developments that took\r\nplace at that Meeting. I am confident that future Meetings\r\nof States parties will continue to strive for the consistent\r\nimplementation and application of the provisions of the\r\nConvention and to take into account the many\r\ndevelopments relating to oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): At the outset, I should\r\nlike, on behalf of the Indonesian delegation, to convey\r\nour deep appreciation to the Secretary-General and to the\r\nstaff of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the\r\nSea, Office of Legal Affairs, for the comprehensive\r\nreports relating to the law of the sea. They outline the\r\nextensive activities that have been undertaken and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nconstitute a significant chronicle of the progress made\r\nduring the past year.\r\nAs we stand on the threshold of a new millennium, it\r\nis most fitting to recall that the adoption in 1982 of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was a\r\nmomentous occasion in the history of international law.\r\nThis landmark document consolidated law and order for the\r\noceans and seas by keeping in mind the loftiest human\r\nideals of justice and respect for the rights and interests of\r\nall nations and peoples. It remains a source of great\r\nsatisfaction that the Convention was produced as a result of\r\nthe efforts of the entire international community, through\r\ncooperation and dialogue to shape a more peaceful world in\r\nwhich universal and national interests were harmoniously\r\ncombined.\r\nSince the milestone event of the Convention’s entry\r\ninto force on 16 November 1994, it is most gratifying to\r\nnote that 122 States have now ratified the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, which augurs well for\r\nthe future of mankind by establishing order in the oceans,\r\nthereby enabling States to develop economically in a stable\r\ninternational environment. In this regard, the annual report\r\nof the Secretary-General reflects the steady progress that\r\nhas been made in the implementation of the Convention. It\r\nhas proved to be a significant period in consolidating the\r\nuniform application of the Convention, harmonizing\r\ninternational and policy developments and ensuring\r\nenhanced cooperation within its framework to deal with\r\nemerging issues and problems.\r\nWe are gratified that the long and arduous process has\r\nnow been completed with the establishment of the “treaty\r\nsystem of ocean institutions”, including the International\r\nSeabed Authority, the International Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf. Indonesia has participated in all these\r\nendeavours from the outset and will continue to play an\r\nactive role in those forums.\r\nIndonesia, as an archipelagic State comprising\r\nthousands of islands, attaches utmost importance to the\r\nConvention and ratified this historic legal document in\r\n1985. Consistent with its firm commitment, it has already\r\nadopted many of the provisions of the Convention in its\r\nnational legislation by the enactment of Law No. 6/1996 of\r\n8 August 1996. Furthermore, Indonesia will continue the\r\nlegislative process to update and revise national laws in line\r\nwith the Convention. It has already in practice applied the\r\nAgreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the\r\nConvention de facto while in the process of ratifying it.\r\nWe remain convinced that the Convention has\r\nbecome the cornerstone for fostering international,\r\nregional and bilateral cooperation among States. Within\r\nthe framework of regional cooperation, we have been\r\nvery supportive of such cooperation through the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\nmechanism and other regional and international\r\norganizations. To ensure good-neighbourliness, Indonesia\r\nhas concluded a number of maritime boundary agreements\r\nwith adjacent countries and is continuing its endeavours\r\nin this field. Desirous of enhancing peace, stability and\r\nprosperity, Indonesia and the other member States of\r\nASEAN have adopted a comprehensive approach to\r\nregional security through the establishment of\r\narrangements, mechanisms, agreements and treaties that\r\ninclude the ASEAN Declaration of a Zone of Peace,\r\nFreedom and Neutrality (ZOPFAN); the Declaration of\r\nASEAN Concord; the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation;\r\nthe South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty;\r\nand the ASEAN Regional Forum as a venue for dialogue\r\nand cooperation on political and security issues.\r\nIn accordance with provisions contained in article 41\r\nof the Convention giving coastal States the right to\r\ndesignate sea lanes and stipulate traffic separation\r\nschemes for straits used for international navigation,\r\nIndonesia and the neighbouring countries of Malaysia and\r\nSingapore have advanced a proposal for new and\r\namended traffic separation schemes in the Straits of\r\nMalacca. In this regard, we are pleased that the Maritime\r\nSafety Committee’s Subcommittee on Safety of\r\nNavigation has approved the proposal with some\r\nmodifications, and will adopt it at its next session,\r\nscheduled to be held in May 1998. It is pertinent to note\r\nin this context that the proposal foresees the establishment\r\nof inshore traffic zones in the Straits to promote a safe\r\nand orderly flow of traffic by separating local from\r\nthrough traffic. It should be pointed out that such zones\r\nhave been successfully implemented in other straits\r\naround the world, contributing to maritime safety.\r\nLikewise, in line with the provisions of article 53 of\r\nthe Convention, on archipelagic waters, Indonesia has\r\nproposed that the Maritime Safety Committee consider the\r\nadoption of archipelagic sea lanes as well as the\r\ncorresponding air routes, based on the need for safety in\r\nnavigating the waters in and around the Indonesian\r\narchipelago. We hope that the Subcommittee will give\r\nfavourable consideration to the revised proposal that\r\nIndonesia plans to put forward at the sixty-ninth session\r\nof the Maritime Safety Committee.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nRecognition of the fragility of the global environment\r\nhas led in recent years to the development of appropriate\r\nlegal mechanisms to tackle this deteriorating situation,\r\nparticularly with respect to the degradation of coastal areas.\r\nIndeed, the Convention was a major inspiration for the\r\nwork of the United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development, held at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.\r\nChapter 17 of Agenda 21, adopted at that Conference,\r\nrefers to the Convention’s provisions on the rights and\r\nduties of States and on the most effective methods of\r\nensuring sustainable development of the marine and coastal\r\nenvironment with a view to the protection and conservation\r\nof marine resources. These provisions have been further\r\naugmented by the Convention on Biological Diversity and\r\nthe Jakarta Mandate on Marine and Coastal Biological\r\nDiversity. In this regard, it should be emphasized that the\r\nJakarta Mandate — covering the following areas: integrated\r\nmarine and coastal area management; marine and coastal\r\nprotected areas; sustainable use of marine and coastal living\r\nresources; and mariculture and alien species — called, inter\r\nalia, for the effective implementation of the Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity concerning marine and coastal\r\nbiodiversity questions. In addition, it recommended a full\r\nreview of all those issues to avoid duplication of\r\nendeavours and to enhance cost-effective cooperation.\r\nAs a maritime nation where the islands and the\r\nsurrounding seas form an ecological entity, Indonesia is\r\ngravely concerned about the degradation of the marine\r\nenvironment. In this regard, Indonesia has adopted national\r\nlegislation in line with the provisions of article 56 (1) of the\r\nConvention concerning the right of a coastal State to\r\nexercise jurisdiction with regard to the protection and\r\npreservation of the marine environment. Our commitment\r\nto the promotion of sustainable development is fully\r\nreflected in the concept that has been part and parcel of the\r\nphilosophy of development in Indonesia for more than two\r\ndecades.\r\nThe heightened awareness inspired by the Convention\r\nwas largely responsible for the successful efforts leading to\r\nthe Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of\r\n10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks. We have consistently extended our\r\nfirm support to this legal regime, which has paved the path\r\nto securing our common goal of ensuring long-term, stable\r\nand sustainable living resources of the vast oceans and seas\r\nbased on cooperation, mutual benefit and shared\r\nresponsibility. Such laudable objectives are in keeping\r\nwith the spirit and provisions of the Convention.\r\nThe Indonesian delegation would like to express its\r\ngratitude to the Under-Secretary-General for Legal\r\nAffairs, the Legal Counsel, for awarding, upon the\r\nrecommendation of the Advisory Panel of experts, the\r\nprestigious Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial\r\nFellowship on the Law of the Sea for 1997-1998 to the\r\ncandidate from Indonesia. We also thank the donors of\r\nthe fellowship programme for their generous contributions\r\nto enhance capacity-building, particularly for the\r\ndeveloping countries, in this vital area of the law.\r\nIndonesia deems it a distinct pleasure to join once\r\nagain in sponsoring a draft resolution on this item. It is\r\nour fervent hope that all Member States will lend this\r\nyear’s draft resolution their unswerving support, for,\r\nwithout a shadow of doubt, all of mankind stands to reap\r\nuntold and vast benefits from the substantive document\r\nthat is the Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nMr. Horoi (Solomon Islands): I have the honour to\r\ntake the floor on behalf of the members of the South\r\nPacific Forum on agenda item 39: “Oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea”. For countries in the vast Pacific Ocean this item\r\nhas a special significance.\r\nThis year marked the very successful outcome of the\r\nSecond Multilateral High-level Conference on the\r\nConservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks in the Western and Central Pacific. The\r\nConference was hosted in Majuro by the Government of\r\nthe Marshall Islands in June of this year. Under the\r\nguidance of His Excellency Satya Nandan, the Conference\r\nfocused on measures to implement the Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks\r\n(the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement).\r\nAttended by representatives of all Forum member\r\nGovernments and of Governments whose vessels fish in\r\nthe area, the Conference reviewed key target stocks,\r\nissues relating to the conservation and management of\r\nhighly migratory fish stocks, and options for the\r\ndevelopment and operation of a regional fisheries\r\nmanagement arrangement, and it agreed on a future\r\nprogramme of work. Organized by the Forum Fisheries\r\nAgency, the Conference concluded with the unanimous\r\nadoption of the Majuro Declaration. The Declaration\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\ncontained a commitment to establish a mechanism for the\r\nconservation and management of the highly migratory fish\r\nstocks of the region in accordance with the 1995 Fish\r\nStocks Agreement.\r\nAt the twenty-eighth meeting of the South Pacific\r\nForum, held in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, in September this\r\nyear, leaders endorsed the convening of inter-sessional\r\nworking groups on fisheries management and on\r\nmonitoring, control and surveillance as well as of a third\r\nmultilateral high-level conference. The high-level\r\nconference will be held in 1998 before the next meeting of\r\nthe Forum.\r\nThe Forum also called on developed States to honour\r\ntheir obligations and commitments to provide financial\r\nassistance to facilitate the participation of Pacific island\r\ncountries at future inter-sessional working group meetings\r\nand at high-level conferences.\r\nThis year the Forum endorsed the concept of a vessel\r\nmonitoring system for the member countries of the Forum\r\nFisheries Agency. This concept will be progressively tested\r\nand implemented for the vessels of distant-water fishing\r\nnations operating in the exclusive economic zones of the\r\nForum Fisheries Agency member countries, according to\r\neach country’s wish. The Forum leaders called on the\r\ndistant-water fishing nations operating in their region to\r\nsupport the vessel monitoring system initiative.\r\nWe in the Pacific are doing our bit in the face of\r\nconcern that many commercially important straddling and\r\nhighly migratory fish stocks continue to be subject to\r\noverfishing. We fully support the adoption of draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.29 calling on all States and other entities\r\nto become party to the Agreement for the Implementation\r\nof the Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nWe particularly welcome the provision contained in\r\noperative paragraph 4 of the draft resolution, which calls on\r\nall States to ensure that any declarations they have made or\r\nmake when becoming party to the Agreement do not\r\npurport to exclude or modify the legal effect of the\r\nprovisions of the Agreement. The Agreement must be\r\napplied consistently with this provision contained in article\r\n43 so that it cannot be construed as having been\r\nundermined or rendered ineffective.\r\nWe fully support the adoption by consensus of draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.30 concerning the global moratorium on\r\nthe use of drift-nets, and the problems of by-catch and\r\nunlawful fishing. This year it is a matter of continuing\r\nconcern that in some areas reports of the unlawful use of\r\ndrift-nets persist. Tremendous numbers of dolphins,\r\nwhales, sharks, turtles and other species have been lost as\r\na result of the continued use of this unacceptable fisheries\r\npractice. It is important that nets be confiscated and\r\ndestroyed, and not sold or transferred to others who may\r\nuse those nets in violation of the global moratorium. The\r\nnets we ban today in one country — and this is very\r\nimportant — must not wind up in other countries\r\ntomorrow.\r\nThe South Pacific Commission and the Forum\r\nFisheries Agency are both involved in managing observer\r\nprogrammes to monitor fishing activities aimed at\r\ncombating illegal drift-net and unauthorized fishing\r\nactivities. The annual review of this problem by the\r\nUnited Nations is important in monitoring these practices.\r\nThis year we welcome the recognition in the draft\r\nresolution of the work of the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) concerning the\r\nreduction of the incidental catch of sea birds and the\r\nmanagement of shark populations and of fishing capacity.\r\nThese are all important emerging issues, and the United\r\nNations is right to focus on them at this time.\r\nWe support the adoption of draft resolution\r\nA/52/L.26 entitled “Oceans and the law of the sea” under\r\nagenda item 39 (a). This year the draft resolution notes\r\nthe important progress made by the new institutions of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority and the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea.It is timely for the draft\r\nresolution to set out the important mandate of the United\r\nNations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the\r\nSea, which Member States from our region particularly\r\nsupport.\r\nFinally, countries from our region endorse the\r\nadoption of draft resolution A/52/L.27 approving the\r\nAgreement concerning the Relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and the International Seabed Authority.\r\nWe look forward to the approval of a similar agreement\r\nwith the Tribunal in the future.\r\nMr. Gray (Australia): Australia associates itself\r\nfully with the statement delivered on behalf of the\r\nmembers of the South Pacific Forum. In view of the\r\nimportance of oceans and law of the sea issues to a\r\nmaritime nation like Australia, we wish to add some\r\nfurther comments.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nThe law of the sea has at last moved beyond the\r\ninstitutional phase into the implementation phase. Australia\r\nwelcomes the election of the members of the Commission\r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which has now met\r\ntwice. As a nation with great interest and valuable\r\nexperience in continental shelf issues, we strongly support\r\nthe provision in the Commission’s rules of procedure for its\r\ndrawing upon outside expertise.\r\nThe Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has adopted its\r\nrules of procedure and, we are pleased to note, on 13\r\nNovember received the first application instituting a case.\r\nThe Tribunal is currently considering that case, which is\r\nbased on article 292 of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea; it is expected to deliver its judgement\r\non 4 December.\r\nPerhaps most importantly, the International Seabed\r\nAuthority has completed the arduous task of establishing its\r\nsubsidiary bodies and an independent budget, and has\r\nbegun its substantive work with the approval of seven work\r\nplans for exploration and the consideration of a draft\r\nmining code. Australia is a sponsor of the draft resolution\r\nwhich would approve the relationship Agreement between\r\nthe United Nations and the Authority (A/52/L.27). We will\r\ncontinue to work with other Assembly members to ensure\r\nthat the mining code is balanced, comprehensive and\r\nworkable and that it provides adequate environmental\r\nprotection. We congratulate Secretary-General Nandan on\r\nhis efforts to establish an efficient and effective secretariat.\r\nAustralia has also co-sponsored the draft resolution on\r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/52/L.26). We believe that\r\nthe international community can and must better coordinate\r\nits handling of the full range of law of the sea and oceans\r\nissues, including their legal, environmental, institutional and\r\neconomic aspects, and we see the draft resolution as\r\ncontributing to that process. Just as we welcomed the\r\ncombining of law of the sea resolutions, formerly\r\nconsidered by the Sixth Committee, with fisheries\r\nresolutions, formerly considered by the Second Committee,\r\ninto a single plenary item, we welcome the new title of this\r\ndraft resolution, “Oceans and the law of the sea”, as a\r\nsymbol of the holistic treatment of these interrelated, cross-\r\nsectoral issues.\r\nWe encourage those bodies dealing with seas and\r\noceans policy and issues, including the Meeting of States\r\nParties to the Convention on the Law of the Sea, the\r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, and the United\r\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP), as well as other\r\norganizations, including the newly created Independent\r\nWorld Commission on the Oceans, to redouble their\r\nefforts to coordinate their work. In particular, we would\r\nlike to see improved information exchange by means of\r\nelectronic networks, such as world wide web sites and e-\r\nmail conferencing, and the holding of regular inter-agency\r\ncoordination meetings.\r\nWe remain convinced of the importance of\r\nstrengthening the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law\r\nof the Sea. It is important to have a focal point in the\r\nSecretariat responsible for compiling information on the\r\nlaw of the sea and its implementation by States, and for\r\nassisting States to carry out their obligations. We urge the\r\nSecretary-General to ensure that the Division provides\r\nadequate support and assistance to the newly created\r\nConvention institutions, especially the International\r\nSeabed Authority.\r\nAustralia is pleased to co-sponsor the draft resolution\r\non the Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks\r\nand Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (A/52/L.29). We\r\nsupport the implementing Agreement and welcome\r\nprogress toward its entry into force. We are currently\r\nreviewing domestic arrangements with a view to\r\nratification, and urge all States to ratify as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nAustralia considers it essential that all parties comply\r\nfully with the letter and spirit of the Agreement once it\r\nhas entered into force. We would not wish to see attempts\r\nto distort its meaning or prevent its full and effective\r\nimplementation through, for example, interpretive\r\ndeclarations.\r\nWe are pleased to note the progress made at the\r\nMultilateral High-level Conference on the Conservation\r\nand Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the\r\nWestern and Central Pacific, held in the Marshall Islands\r\nearlier this year, on the development of a regional\r\nfisheries management arrangement for the Central and\r\nWestern Pacific. We encourage all participants to continue\r\nthe excellent cooperative approach achieved at that\r\nmeeting.\r\nAustralia is greatly concerned about the recent\r\nincrease in illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean. We have\r\ntaken, and will continue to take, concrete steps to combat\r\nillegal fishing and properly manage the resources within\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nour exclusive economic zone. We urge all States to take\r\nappropriate measures, both unilaterally and through regional\r\nmanagement organizations such as the Commission for the\r\nConservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to\r\nprevent illegal and unregulated fishing, including in the\r\nSouthern Ocean.\r\nAustralia supports the provisions in draft resolutions\r\nA/52/L.29 and L.30, on fisheries, that the biennialized\r\nSecretary-General’s reports, and the agenda sub-items\r\nrelating to them, arise in alternate years, and that the\r\nreports draw upon information from a wide range of\r\nsources. Alternating the reports and the attendant debate\r\nwill spread the Secretariat’s burden more evenly and help\r\nensure that debate is topical and based on the most up-to-\r\ndate information.\r\nAustralia has also sponsored draft resolution L.30,\r\nentitled “Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing: unauthorized\r\nfishing in zones of national jurisdiction and on the high\r\nseas; fisheries by-catch and discards; and other\r\ndevelopments”. We are reaching the limits of tolerance with\r\nrespect to continuing reports of violations of past General\r\nAssembly resolutions, in particular of the global\r\nmoratorium on drift-net fishing. We insist upon full\r\nimplementation and observance of the moratorium and call\r\nupon States to ensure that drift-nets are confiscated and\r\ndestroyed, not sold or transferred to others who can then\r\ncontinue this abominable and illegal practice.\r\nWe note progress made under the Wellington\r\nConvention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Drift-\r\nnets in the South Pacific Region. This is a good example of\r\nregional action in which we invite Asia-Pacific and distant-\r\nwater fishing nations to participate without delay.\r\nAustralia does not believe that detailed monitoring of\r\nthe implementation of this resolution will be necessary. We\r\nwould like to see the Secretary-General continue to compile\r\ninformation on the nature and effectiveness of measures\r\nStates have employed to ensure implementation. We urge\r\nall members of the international community to implement\r\nand comply with the resolution and to report to the\r\nSecretary-General any conduct inconsistent with its terms.\r\nAustralia attaches particular importance to the\r\nsustainable development of small island States. We have\r\nbeen closely involved in the implementation in the South\r\nPacific of the outcomes of the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, especially the Barbados Programme of Action, and\r\nare very pleased with the decision of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development at its fifth session that a special\r\nsession of the General Assembly should be held in 1999\r\nto assess implementation.\r\nAustralia has always played an active role in the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of the law of the sea\r\nand related instruments, and we shall continue to do so.\r\nThe International Year of the Ocean in 1998 will provide\r\nan opportunity to focus attention on this area and elicit\r\nnew ideas.\r\nMr. Saliba (Malta): The item on oceans and the law\r\nof the sea has assumed importance in the Assembly’s\r\nagenda. Over the years the issues discussed under this\r\nitem have grown as we have seen the further development\r\nof international law in this field.\r\nParamount among all the items dealing with oceans\r\nis the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nAfter many years of discussion and negotiation, we\r\nwitnessed its entry into force in 1994. In just over three\r\nyears the number of parties to the Convention has\r\ndoubled. This speedy increase in the number of States\r\nparties is witness to the desire to achieve the universality\r\nof the Convention.\r\nThe Convention provides a comprehensive\r\nframework dealing with oceans. It is a Convention which\r\naddresses not only issues relating to peace and security\r\nbut also issues ranging from pollution, conservation and\r\nmanagement to dispute settlement. Even more\r\nimportantly, it has established a unique principle in\r\ninternational law: the common heritage of mankind.\r\nThe past two years have seen the establishment of\r\nthe institutions relating to the Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea. With the entry into force of the Convention and\r\nthe adoption of the Agreement relating to the\r\nImplementation of Part XI of the Convention, the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority has been established and\r\nhas itself instituted its internal mechanisms. The Authority\r\nis now focusing on the more substantive issues relating to\r\ndeep seabed mining. The ongoing negotiations on the\r\ndraft Mining Code will hopefully yield good and\r\ncomprehensive results. It is our hope that the issues\r\nrelating to the protection and preservation of the marine\r\nenvironment will be adequately covered in any final\r\noutcome. Such principles need to be guaranteed, for it is\r\nsuch aspects which ultimately preserve the notion of a\r\ncommon heritage.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in\r\nHamburg, Germany, has also developed its operational\r\nfeatures and has only recently begun its substantive work,\r\nwith its first hearing on an institution of proceedings\r\nsubmitted by a State party. Likewise, the Commission on\r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf has undertaken to\r\nfinalize its regulations and methods of procedure.\r\nThe establishment and functioning of these bodies of\r\nthe Convention is in itself a signal that the Convention is\r\ntaking root not only in terms of legal principle but also in\r\nits impact on the issues and in regulating those areas for\r\nwhich the Convention was established.\r\nThe Convention on the Law of the Sea has continued\r\nto be strengthened through the negotiation and adoption of\r\nagreements to further define and regulate areas which the\r\nConvention did not fully address. The agreement on\r\nstraddling fish stocks is an example, in which the\r\ninternational community, taking the Convention as its basis,\r\nsought to address a potential area of dispute and to promote\r\ncooperation in the use of resources. Efforts made and\r\nagreements reached in the Food and Agricultural\r\nOrganization in Rome also promote and respond to the need\r\nto institute regulations in the field of the conservation and\r\nmanagement of ocean resources.\r\nThe regional approach remains a valid and important\r\none. Within the Mediterranean region, Malta has promoted\r\nthe need for further measures with respect to pollution\r\ncontrol, and it hosts the regional centre to combat oil\r\npollution. The need to enhance cooperation in the field of\r\nconservation and management remains crucial to the\r\nunderlying notion of common heritage.\r\nThe sustainable use of fish resources is one aspect to\r\nwhich we are particularly attached. Within the General\r\nFisheries Council for the Mediterranean, Malta recently\r\nmade a recommendation concerning drift-net fishing. This\r\nculminated in the adoption of resolution 97/1, which\r\nrecommended that the contracting parties of the Council\r\nmay not keep on board or use for fishing one or more drift-\r\nnets whose individual or total length is more than 2.5\r\nkilometres. It was further decided that such nets, if longer\r\nthan 1 kilometre, should remain attached to the vessel\r\nunless it is within the 12 mile coastal band.\r\nFurthermore, the Government of Malta is currently\r\nundertaking to draft legislation regarding conservation and\r\nmanagement measures in order to be in a better position to\r\neffectively apply the principles of sustainable development.\r\nA number of bodies of the United Nations system\r\nhave increasingly begun to deal with the issue of oceans\r\nand the law of the sea. The recent decision on this issue\r\n(resolution S-19/2, annex, para. 36) taken during the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the review\r\nand appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21, and\r\nthe Assembly’s decision that the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development will take up the issue during its\r\nseventh session, in 1999, are indicative of the wide\r\nimpact that such issues have in today’s international\r\nclimate. Such discussions should provide the opportunity\r\nto foster international cooperation in promoting the\r\nconservation and sustainable use of the marine\r\nenvironment within the overall framework provided by\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe General Assembly has proclaimed 1998 the\r\nInternational Year of the Ocean. It is our hope that this\r\ncommemoration will further enhance and encourage the\r\nuniversality of the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea. Other commemorations continue to promote\r\nsuch universality, such as the recent convocation in Malta\r\nof the 25th Pacem in Maribus conference with the aim of\r\npromoting peace, security and sustainable development in\r\nfurtherance of the concept of the common heritage of\r\nmankind.\r\nOur successes in recent years with respect to the law\r\nof the sea have been many. We have embarked on a\r\nprocess where legal theory can be put into effective\r\npractice. As we do so, the overall objectives as\r\nproclaimed in the Convention must be borne in mind. The\r\nprinciple of cooperation permeates the notion of the\r\ncommon heritage of mankind. It is a cooperation which\r\ngoes far beyond the present and looks to the future. The\r\nfurther consolidation of this principle can better serve not\r\nonly present but also future generations. Malta pledges its\r\ncontinued support to this ongoing process.\r\nMr. Mohammed (Ethiopia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. Mahugu (Kenya): My delegation is pleased to\r\nparticipate in this debate on the consolidated agenda item\r\n39, entitled “Oceans and the law of the sea”. The item\r\ncovers the entire broad range of issues which concern\r\noceans and the law of the sea, from developments in the\r\nfield of conservation and the management of living\r\nmarine resources to the sustainable use of the marine\r\nenvironment.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nBearing in mind the strategic importance of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea as a framework\r\nfor national, regional and global actions in the marine\r\nsector, as underlined by the General Assembly in its\r\nresolution 49/28, the importance of this annual\r\nconsideration and review of the overall developments\r\nrelating to implementation of the law of the sea cannot be\r\noveremphasized. Our overview of this process of\r\nimplementation is made much easier today by the excellent\r\nreports submitted by the Secretary-General, covering a wide\r\narea and recording activities and developments of the past\r\none year during which important milestones were reached.\r\nWe would like to commend the Secretary-General and the\r\nstaff of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the\r\nSea for this high standard of work.\r\nSince the entry into force of the Convention in late\r\n1994, the international community has devoted its attention\r\nmainly to the establishment of the institutions created under\r\nthe Convention and their subsidiary organs. In March this\r\nyear, during the Sixth Meeting of States Parties, 21\r\nmembers of the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf were elected, thereby completing the\r\nsystem of ocean institutions made up of the International\r\nSeabed Authority, the International Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea and the Commission itself.\r\nWe have noted that the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf began addressing a number of\r\nimportant issues related to its work during its last session\r\nin September this year. Since its members serve in their\r\npersonal capacity and do not receive any remuneration from\r\nthe United Nations, the recommendation to the States\r\nparties to consider establishing a fund to cover the travel\r\nand accommodation expenses of members of the\r\nCommission from developing countries deserves favourable\r\nattention.\r\nAnother significant event in the international\r\ncommunity’s quest to apply the rule of law in relations\r\nbetween States in marine affairs was the successful\r\ncompletion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea of its judicial organizational phase, despite operating\r\nwith a modest budget and a tiny staff under its President,\r\nThomas Mensah. In particular, we are pleased to note that\r\nlast month, during its fourth session, the Tribunal adopted\r\nthree significant instruments, namely; the rules of the\r\nTribunal, a set of guidelines to assist parties in presenting\r\ncases, and a resolution on internal judicial practice.\r\nThese instruments will not only facilitate the smooth\r\nfunctioning of the Tribunal and its chambers, but will also\r\nmake it more amenable to potential litigants, thereby\r\nproviding the necessary assurance of dispute settlement\r\nand regulation which are essential ingredients in the\r\noverall success of the Convention.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the International\r\nSeabed Authority has also completed its organizational\r\nphase and is now entering the functional one. It has done\r\nso in a cost-effective and efficient manner consistent with\r\nthe evolutionary approach to which we all subscribed at\r\nthe beginning. We are particularly impressed by the vision\r\nof the future role of the Authority, as presented by its\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Satya Nandan, which is in keeping\r\nwith the mandate given to it by the Convention. We\r\nbelieve that the Authority should be provided with\r\nadequate resources to enable it to carry out its functions,\r\nparticularly during the coming period in which its\r\nadministrative expenses will be met through the assessed\r\ncontribution of its members. Kenya, for its part, will soon\r\nhonour its commitments to pay its share.\r\nThe success of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea lies, to a large extent, in the political\r\nwill and commitment of States to abide by its provisions.\r\nThat 122 countries have so far become party to the\r\nConvention — almost double the number of States parties\r\nat the time of its entry into force exactly three years\r\nago — is a clear indication of the international\r\ncommunity’s readiness to establish true universality\r\nthrough the widest possible participation.\r\nThe final realization of the Convention’s many\r\nbenefits will, however, require positive, sustained and\r\ncollective efforts by States. We continue to be concerned\r\nthat a growing number of States have made declarations\r\nor statements at the time of ratification or accession under\r\narticle 310 of the Convention which are inconsistent and\r\nhave the legal effect of modifying the provisions thereof.\r\nParagraph 2 of draft resolution A/52/L.26, which is before\r\nus, reiterates the call made by this Assembly at its last\r\nsession to States to ensure that such declarations and their\r\nnational legislation conform to the provisions of the\r\nConvention. We urge those States to adhere to this\r\nrequirement and withdraw any inconsistent declarations or\r\nactions.\r\nAs the activities derived from the implementation of\r\nthe Convention increase, so do the practical requirements\r\nof promoting and assisting State practice in accordance\r\nwith the Convention. In this regard, the special needs of\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly for training in ocean\r\nand coastal area management and development, as well as\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nin the conduct of marine scientific research, are more acute\r\nthan before. There is, therefore, a need to pay more\r\nattention in this direction.\r\nWe continue to believe that the development of\r\nharmonized practices of States through the equitable,\r\nconsistent and coherent application of the Convention\r\nremains a key challenge. In this regard, we would like to\r\nunderscore the important role being played by the Division\r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea. The Division\r\ncontinues to carry out vital responsibilities in this area and\r\nshould be strengthened as the focal point for a coordinated\r\nand integrated approach to oceans and law of the sea issues.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation is once again pleased to\r\nbe able to sponsor draft resolutions A/52/L.26 and L.27. It\r\nis our hope that all members will be able to support the\r\ndraft resolutions before us.\r\nMr. Odoi-Anim (Ghana): Ghana welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s reports on “Oceans and the law of the\r\nsea” contained in documents A/52/487 and A/52/491. The\r\nreports are well written and comprehensive. They address\r\nseveral pertinent aspects of the ongoing harmonization of\r\ninternational legal and policy issues in relation to the law\r\nof the sea and ocean affairs. We are grateful to the\r\nSecretary-General and the Division for Ocean Affairs and\r\nthe Law of the Sea for the reports.\r\nThe entry into force of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea in 1994 was a significant step in the\r\nevolution of a legal regime to govern matters of the sea. It\r\nnecessarily involved the establishment of institutions created\r\nunder the Convention, as well as the coordination and\r\nharmonization of the legal issues and policy matters arising\r\nfrom the Convention.\r\nThe elections to and subsequent establishment of the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in\r\nMarch this year brought to a conclusion the process of\r\nestablishing institutions under the Convention.\r\nThe delegation of Ghana notes with satisfaction that\r\nall institutions established under the Convention have,\r\nwithin the present resource constraints, taken the necessary\r\nsteps required of them to enable them effectively to\r\ndischarge their mandates under the Convention. In this\r\nconnection, it is noteworthy that both the International\r\nSeabed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law\r\nof the Sea, two key institutions in the new legal regime on\r\noceans, have performed creditably to date.\r\nThe constitution within a relatively short period of\r\nthree standing chambers by the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea, that is, the Chamber of Summary\r\nProcedure, the Chamber for Fisheries Disputes and the\r\nChamber for Marine Environment Disputes, in addition to\r\nthe Seabed Disputes Chamber, deserves special mention.\r\nIn the light of these developments, the Ghana\r\ndelegation takes the view that it is now time for the\r\ninternational community to address itself to specific\r\naspects of the oceans and related issues affecting Member\r\nStates, particularly developing countries.\r\nThere are remarkable differences in the levels of\r\nsocial and economic development between Member\r\nStates. Such differences are directly linked to the ability\r\nof developing countries to fully utilize all aspects of the\r\noceans, and to adjust to the consequences of changes in\r\nthe overall marine environment.\r\nThe effects of these differences are also reflected in\r\nthe application of ocean science and acquisition of marine\r\ntechnology. We are confident that the sense of urgency,\r\nmutual accommodation and the spirit of compromise\r\nwhich characterized the institution-building phase of our\r\ncollective endeavour will similarly be reflected at this\r\nstage. The Secretary-General, in his role as the\r\ncoordinating bureau on the law of the sea and ocean\r\naffairs, has a crucial role to play in this regard. The\r\nUnited Nations should now initiate policy objectives\r\nwhich will enhance the capacity of developing countries,\r\nwith a view to addressing the effects of the imbalance I\r\nmentioned earlier. This will enable developing countries\r\nto fully utilize the benefits conferred on them under the\r\nConvention, as well as enhancing their effectiveness in\r\nthe discharge of their obligations under the Convention.\r\nThe Ghana delegation, in light of the aforesaid, is\r\npleased to note that part V of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport (A/52/487) focuses at length on the development of\r\nmarine resources and the protection of the marine\r\nenvironment, an issue of utmost concern to our\r\ndelegation.\r\nIt is regrettable that the report of the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) on the Global\r\nenvironmental outlook indicates a continuous trend of\r\nenvironmental deterioration. According to the report, one\r\nthird of the world’s coastal regions are at a high risk of\r\ndegradation, particularly from land-based activities. This\r\nis especially alarming in the light of the importance of the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nworld’s oceans to the health of the global environment and\r\nto economic and social development.\r\nThough the obligation to protect the marine\r\nenvironment and other related issues have been addressed\r\nby a large number of legal instruments at global and\r\nregional levels, which recommend practices and procedures\r\nfor marine environmental protection, the practices of States\r\nreflect inconsistencies and a glaring lack of uniformity.\r\nGhana urges all States parties to ensure that specific\r\nobligations assumed under separate treaty regimes are\r\nundertaken in a manner consistent with the general\r\nprinciples and objectives of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea, so as to bring such obligations\r\nwithin the framework of paragraph 2 of article 237 of the\r\nConvention, which provides as follows:\r\n“Specific obligations assumed by States under special\r\nconventions, with respect to the protection and\r\npreservation of the marine environment, should be\r\ncarried out in a manner consistent with the general\r\nprinciples and objectives of this Convention.”\r\nMy delegation is of the view that intensive, comprehensive\r\nand coordinated efforts at the regional and global levels\r\nwould progressively facilitate this objective.\r\nGhana also welcomes the initiatives undertaken within\r\nthe framework of the integrated marine and coastal area\r\nmanagement programme as indicated in paragraphs 234-237\r\nof the Secretary-General’s report (A/52/487). Ghana is in\r\nfull agreement with the conclusions arrived at by the first\r\nMeeting of Experts on Marine and Coastal Biological\r\nDiversity, which convened in Jakarta in March of this year,\r\nand particularly with those decisions that underscore the\r\nfact that integrated marine and coastal management\r\nconstitutes the most effective tool for implementing the\r\nConvention on Biological Diversity and that actions taken\r\nin this direction should be based on the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nGhana is hopeful that such initiatives will receive the\r\nsupport of the private sector. It is also our expectation that\r\nspecialized bodies such as UNEP and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) will intensify their\r\nefforts in this sphere and extend their activities to the\r\ndevelopment of country-specific programmes, for\r\ndeveloping countries in particular. Efforts along these lines\r\nwould be in conformity with the overall objectives and\r\nresolutions of the nineteenth special session of the General\r\nAssembly on oceans and seas, and also with Assembly\r\nresolution 51/189 of 16 December 1996, which, in effect,\r\nurged Governments to strengthen the institutional links\r\nbetween relevant intergovernmental mechanisms involved\r\nin the development and implementation of integrated\r\ncoastal zone management programmes.\r\nI will at this stage address issues related to two\r\ntopics presented in sub-sections 4 and 5 of section B,\r\nunder part IV of the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/52/487). These are marine casualties and assistance at\r\nsea, issues covered by articles 94, paragraph 7, and 98 of\r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea. These issues are\r\nof great concern to my delegation. Article 94, paragraph\r\n7, of the Convention enjoins States to cause inquiries to\r\nbe held by or before a suitably qualified person or\r\npersons\r\n“into every marine casualty or incident of navigation\r\non the high seas involving a ship flying its flag and\r\ncausing loss of life or serious injury to nationals of\r\nanother State”.\r\nOn the other hand, article 98 enjoins a State, among\r\nother things, to\r\n“require the master of a ship flying its flag ...:\r\n“(a) to render assistance to any person found\r\nat sea in danger of being lost;”\r\nand\r\n“(b) to proceed with all possible speed to the\r\nrescue of persons in distress”.\r\nThe combined effect of these two articles is to\r\nensure that incidents involving the loss of lives at sea are\r\nthoroughly investigated and that assistance is provided to\r\nall manner of persons in distress at sea. This also implies,\r\nin our view, the obligation not to create the situations\r\nwhich these articles seek to redress.\r\nIt is therefore regrettable that ships flying the flags\r\nof some Member States, in utter disregard for human\r\nlives and human decency, continue to throw individuals\r\nthey perceive to be stowaways into shark-infested waters,\r\ngiving them no chance of survival. Some of the\r\nstowaways have been murdered outright on the ships,\r\nwhile stowaways on other ships have been set on rafts on\r\nthe high seas and been left to their fate. It is equally\r\nregrettable that even ships in the proximity of such\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nunfortunate individuals have refused to render the assistance\r\nrequired of them.\r\nThe phenomenon of stowaways is not new. What is\r\nnew, and what should be confronted with vigour, is the\r\ndegree of cruelty with which masters of ships flying the\r\nflags of some States present in this forum seek to address\r\nthe problem.\r\nGhana, for its part, has taken steps to curb stowaway\r\nincidents originating in our ports. These steps include new\r\nlegislation which prescribes stiffer penalties for stowaways,\r\nimprovements in port security and the coordination of\r\nefforts between the Ghana National Union of Seamen and\r\nthe relevant governmental agencies to educate youth and the\r\npublic at large on the dangers of stowing away.\r\nWe hope, therefore, that Member States will fully\r\ndischarge their obligations under article 94, paragraph 7,\r\nand article 98 of the Convention. We further suggest that\r\nthe outcome of inquiries undertaken within the framework\r\nof article 94, paragraph 7, should be made available by\r\nStates parties involved for inclusion in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on this item.\r\nIt is also our hope that the draft International Maritime\r\nOrganization (IMO) Assembly resolution on the Code for\r\nthe Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents, when\r\nadopted by the Assembly of that Organization, will further\r\nstrengthen the existing legal regime on this subject.\r\nOn the status of the Agreement relating to the\r\nImplementation of Part XI of the Convention, I wish to\r\nstate that the Government of Ghana is taking the necessary\r\nprocedural steps within our national Constitution to ratify\r\nin the near future the Agreement relating to the\r\nImplementation of Part XI of the Convention.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish once again to reiterate our\r\nappreciation for the Secretary-General’s report on this\r\nsubject. It is our hope that Member States will fully utilize\r\nthe challenge and opportunities presented by the\r\nInternational Year of the Ocean in 1998 to improve global\r\ndecision-making at all levels on the marine environment\r\nand to enhance its sustainable use. We must continue to\r\nhighlight the importance of the Convention in our\r\ndevelopmental efforts and expand our cooperation at all\r\nlevels and on all aspects of the United Nations Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea.\r\nMr. Biørn Lian (Norway): The making of a new\r\ninternational order of the oceans required 15 years of\r\nsustained efforts. That process has gone down in history\r\nas one of the most complex and successful multilateral\r\nnegotiations. The United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea balances a variety of national interests and\r\nrepresents a “package deal” with a comprehensive\r\nframework of principles and rules.\r\nSeen from the perspective of a country such as\r\nNorway, whose society is highly dependent on peaceful\r\nuses of the seas, this framework contributes substantially\r\nto both legal certainty and international stability. It is\r\nagainst this background that Norway ratified the\r\nConvention and acceded to the Agreement relating to the\r\nImplementation of Part XI of the Convention in 1996.\r\nMoreover, we are delighted by the continuously\r\nincreasing number of States parties acceding to these two\r\nlegal instruments.\r\nMore than 120 ratifications, accessions or\r\nsuccessions give reason to believe in the realization of the\r\ngoal of universal participation. We hope that those States\r\nthat may dislike certain elements contained in the\r\nConvention or the Agreement, will find at the end of the\r\nday that, on balance, their national interests, in addition\r\nto those of the international community, will be well\r\nserved by accession to these instruments. At the same\r\ntime, it is necessary to stress that the Agreement relating\r\nto the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention is an\r\nintegral part of the package. There seems to be a\r\ndiscrepancy between the relatively low number of States\r\nparties to the Agreement, which is less than 90, and the\r\nnumber of States parties to the Convention. We therefore\r\nhope that this gap will be bridged in the very near future.\r\nThe information contained in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General relating to States’ attempts through\r\ndeclarations to attach conditions which may modify the\r\nlegal effects of provisions of the Convention gives rise to\r\nconcern. When ratifying the Convention in 1996, Norway\r\nissued a declaration to the effect that it objected to any\r\nnational declarations or statements that were not\r\ncompatible with the provisions of articles 309 and 310 of\r\nthe Convention.\r\nWhile the main framework for the new international\r\norder of the oceans was laid down in the Convention and\r\nthe Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI\r\nof the Convention, only certain building-blocks where\r\nthus set in place with regard to fisheries on the high seas.\r\nThe important work carried out at the United Nations\r\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, which resulted in the related\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nAgreement of 1995, provided further walling and roofing\r\nfor a new legal architecture. This architecture is necessary\r\nin order to meet the vital challenges of the management of\r\nfisheries on the high seas. Norway was among the early\r\nratifiers of this Agreement and hopes that the process of\r\nratification which has been undertaken by a number of\r\nStates will soon lead to its entry into force.\r\nAt the same time, it ought to be stressed that the status\r\nof fisheries on the high seas is in certain cases so alarming\r\nthat one cannot await the entry into force of the 1995\r\nAgreement in order to take action. Unregulated fisheries\r\nneed to be brought under control, and this is a precondition\r\nfor the sustainable development of important fisheries.\r\nConcerted action and increased levels of cooperation need\r\nto be accompanied by national implementation measures in\r\norder to ensure credibility. Regional and subregional\r\ncooperation arrangements for fisheries on the high seas\r\nneed to be developed further in conformity with the\r\nprinciples envisaged in the 1995 Agreement. In the North\r\nAtlantic this work is well under way under the auspices of\r\nthe North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC)\r\nand the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organization\r\n(NAFO).\r\nMoreover, we are highly encouraged by the recent\r\nmeasures adopted by the Commission for the Conservation\r\nof Antarctic Marine Living Resources with regard to the\r\nillegal and unregulated fishing of Patagonian toothfish.\r\nConcerted action within NAFO working towards extended\r\nuse of satellite-monitoring systems constitutes another\r\nimportant example of steps taken towards the efficient\r\nconservation and management of stocks, including effective\r\ncontrol of compliance with measures at the regional or\r\nsubregional level. In this connection, it is also worth\r\nmentioning the NAFO prohibition against landings and\r\ntrans-shipments in all contracting-party ports of all fish\r\nfrom non-contracting-party vessels caught in contravention\r\nof NAFO regulations, a measure to which we attach great\r\nsignificance.\r\nMy delegation would now like to make a general\r\nobservation concerning developments in ocean affairs and\r\nthe law of the sea, namely, the proliferation of negotiation\r\nprocesses and decision-making in a number of international\r\nbodies, as well as the conclusion of new international\r\nagreements with direct relevance to the international order\r\nof the seas. Keeping track of such developments is\r\nadmittedly very difficult, and that is not least the case for\r\nnational Governments, which strive for coordination of\r\nefforts directed at ensuring consistency with the law of the\r\nsea. A precondition for achieving this aim is to obtain on\r\na regular basis a comprehensive survey of all current\r\nactivities which may have a bearing on this area of the\r\nlaw. Norway is convinced that the General Assembly can,\r\nthrough the discussion of this item, provide necessary\r\nguidance and coordination. Such a role for the General\r\nAssembly is fully consistent with Articles 10 and 13 of\r\nthe United Nations Charter. In this regard, the informative\r\nvalue of the comprehensive report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral cannot be overstated.\r\nAmong examples of developments highlighted by\r\nthat report, one may point to the important new role\r\nplayed by international bodies as diverse as the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO) in London and\r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in\r\nNew York with regard to the implementation of key\r\nprovisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe IMO is recognized as the international body\r\nresponsible for adopting ships’ routing systems, which\r\nhave direct bearing on navigation through international\r\nstraits as well as archipelagic sea lanes. The\r\ncomprehensive and practical experience of the IMO with\r\nregard to ships’ routing measures is an essential element\r\nwhen considering ways and means to implement new\r\nrules of international law pursuant to parts III and IV of\r\nthe Convention. Norway is satisfied that the orderly and\r\nmethodical approach taken in preparing the first-ever\r\ndesignation of archipelagic sea lanes is setting an\r\nimportant precedent in this important field. The IMO also\r\nplays an important role in other fields closely related to\r\nthe implementation of the Convention, one example, to\r\nwhich Norway attaches great significance, being the IMO\r\nguidelines for the removal and disposal of offshore\r\ninstallations and structures. This is a highly complex issue\r\nwhich deserves careful and dispassionate study.\r\nAnother example of an area where the report of the\r\nSecretary-General provides important updated information\r\nis the work done by the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf, which has carried out preparatory work\r\non its rules of procedure. We hope that this work will\r\nlead to the needed clarifications to enable States to\r\npresent the first submissions to the Commission.\r\nMy delegation would also like to stress the\r\nimportance of consistency between new international\r\nagreements and the Convention. Norway has raised this\r\nissue in the context of the ongoing negotiations in the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\n(OECD) on a multilateral agreement on investment. It is\r\nimportant that due account be taken of both the\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\ngeographical and functional limits on coastal-State authority\r\nbeyond the territorial sea when negotiating such new\r\nagreements. Furthermore, such new agreements should not\r\ninterfere with the rules of the Law of the Sea Convention\r\npertaining to the conservation and management of natural\r\nresources.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to emphasize the\r\nneed for an early dissemination of this very useful report by\r\nthe Secretary-General. This is, in fact, a prerequisite for\r\nuseful discussions under this agenda item. I would like to\r\nrecall that our delegation, in the course of the last Meeting\r\nof States Parties to the Convention, expressed a strong wish\r\nfor an early publication of the report during this General\r\nAssembly session. We regret that this extremely useful and\r\ncomprehensive report was, once again, made available\r\nrather late. We hope that improvements will be made in this\r\nregard at the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Jele (South Africa): Agenda item 39, “Oceans\r\nand the law of the sea,” is an important one for South\r\nAfrica. My delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the high quality of his comprehensive annual\r\nreports on this item, contained in documents A/52/487,\r\nA/52/491, A/52/555 and A/52/557. It is our view that the\r\ndecision taken in General Assembly resolution 51/34 to\r\nconsider in an expanded manner all aspects of ocean\r\nmanagement under one agenda item is already beginning to\r\npay dividends. My delegation also wishes to thank the\r\ndelegations of New Zealand and the United States of\r\nAmerica for introducing the draft resolutions on this item,\r\nas contained in documents A/52/L.26, L.27, L.29 and L.30.\r\nOn 16 November 1994, little more than three years\r\nago, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nentered into force following the deposit with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the sixtieth instrument of ratification exactly one\r\nyear before. Since then, a further 62 instruments of\r\nratification or accession have been received, bringing the\r\ntotal number of States parties to the Convention to 122 and\r\nat the same time making it one of the most successful and\r\ncomprehensive international conventions ever negotiated\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. Indeed, it is a\r\ntribute to the drafters of the Convention that 15 years after\r\nits adoption and opening for signature on 10 December\r\n1982, significant numbers of States continue to become\r\nparties to it. The Convention’s appeal lies in the fact that\r\nwith 17 parts and nine annexes, as well as an\r\nimplementation Agreement, the Convention is the most\r\ncomprehensive regime dealing with all matters relating to\r\nthe law of the sea. We have no doubt that the Convention\r\nis well on its way to universal acceptance.\r\nAlthough it is not presently among the 122 States\r\nparties, South Africa has actively participated in the seven\r\nMeetings of States Parties, as well as being a provisional\r\nmember of the International Seabed Authority (ISA).\r\nMoreover, South Africa’s Maritime Zones Act of 1994 is\r\nin conformity with the provisions of the Convention.\r\nNevertheless, South Africa expects to join the family of\r\nStates parties in the very near future. The South African\r\ncabinet approved ratification of the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea on 20 August 1997 and the matter is\r\ncurrently under consideration in Parliament, where a final\r\ndecision is due at any time.\r\nSignificant developments in the field of oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea have taken place since the adoption of\r\nresolution 51/34 on 9 December 1996. I wish to comment\r\non only a few of these developments at this stage.\r\nSouth Africa welcomes the progress made by the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority during its two-part third\r\nsession in 1997. We note with satisfaction the approval of\r\nplans of work for exploration by seven registered pioneer\r\ninvestors, as well as the progress that has been made on\r\nthe Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the ISA, its\r\nFinancial Regulations and the Headquarters Agreement\r\nwith the Government of Jamaica. It is our hope that the\r\nAuthority will be in a position to adopt the Protocol, the\r\nAgreement and the Regulations at its next session.\r\nMoreover, for the first time since the Authority’s\r\nestablishment, its budget will be met by assessed\r\ncontributions of its members, including its provisional\r\nmembers. To ensure ISA’s efficient operation and\r\nmanagement, it is therefore imperative that members pay\r\ntheir assessed contributions to the Authority in full, on\r\ntime and without conditions.\r\nThe Legal and Technical Commission has made\r\nmuch progress during 1997 in its consideration of the\r\ndraft regulations on prospecting and exploration of\r\npolymetallic nodules in the Area, as well as the draft\r\nstandard terms of exploration contract. It is our earnest\r\nhope that the Commission can complete its work early in\r\nthe fourth session of the Authority in March 1998, so that\r\nthe Council can take up the matter and possibly adopt the\r\nmining code at that session. South Africa considers it\r\nimperative that the mining code be a balanced code that\r\ntakes into account the interests of those wishing to exploit\r\nthe resources of the Area, as well as environmental\r\nconsiderations, so as to ensure that any mining activities\r\nthat may be undertaken do not cause serious damage to\r\nthe marine environment.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nSouth Africa is also honoured to be one of the\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution, contained in document\r\nA/52/L.27, concerning the approval of the Relationship\r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority. The Relationship\r\nAgreement is essential to small independent organizations\r\nsuch as ISA so as to ensure their continued well-being. We\r\nstrongly recommend its adoption by the General Assembly\r\nwithout a vote.\r\nWe wish to commend the Secretary-General of the\r\nAuthority, Mr. Satya Nandan, for the efficient and cost-\r\neffective manner in which he has established the Authority\r\nin Kingston, Jamaica.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea,\r\nwith its seat in Hamburg, Germany, has also made\r\nsignificant progress during the last year. We note with\r\nsatisfaction that, after only one year, the Tribunal has been\r\nable to adopt three very significant instruments: its Rules of\r\nprocedure, a set of Guidelines to assist parties in presenting\r\ncases, and a resolution on the Internal Judicial Practice of\r\nthe Tribunal, which sets out the manner in which the\r\ndeliberations of the judges will take place. We commend\r\nthe Tribunal most highly for its efforts in ensuring that the\r\nRules are efficient, cost-effective and user-friendly.\r\nThe adoption of the Rules of the Tribunal, the\r\nGuidelines and the resolution, together with the constitution\r\nof the four standing Chambers, have come at a most\r\nopportune time, as we have recently learnt that the Tribunal\r\nhas now received its first case. For its part, South Africa\r\nwill follow the deliberations and outcome of the application\r\nbefore the Tribunal with keen interest.\r\nThe institution-building that was required by the\r\nConvention has now been completed with the election of 21\r\nmembers of the Commission on the Limits on the\r\nContinental Shelf during the Sixth Meeting of States Parties\r\nin March 1997. South Africa welcomes its establishment\r\nand takes note of the progress it made during its two\r\nsessions in 1997 on its rules of procedure and with its\r\ninternal functioning. The Commission will no doubt play a\r\nvital role in the determination of the outer limits of the\r\ncontinental shelf of coastal States.\r\nThe importance of the Division for Ocean Affairs and\r\nthe Law of the Sea should also not be lost sight of. In fact,\r\nthe Convention entrusts a number of specific responsibilities\r\nto the Secretary-General, some of which are spelled out in\r\noperative paragraph 11 of draft resolution A/52/L.26. Two\r\nof the most important responsibilities are the preparation of\r\nthe comprehensive annual report for consideration by the\r\nAssembly and the collection, compilation and\r\ndissemination of information on ocean affairs. It is\r\ntherefore incumbent upon this Assembly to ensure that the\r\nDivision has the necessary resources and manpower to\r\neffectively perform these duties.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, South Africa adopted the\r\nMaritime Zones Act of 1994, which establishes a\r\nterritorial sea, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone\r\nand continental shelf for South Africa. All these zones are\r\nin accordance with the Convention. We note with concern\r\nfrom the Secretary-General’s report that 15 States, some\r\nof which are States parties to the Convention, continue to\r\nclaim a territorial sea in excess of the limit of 12 nautical\r\nmiles, as mandated in article 3 of the Convention. In\r\naddition, one State claims a contiguous zone in excess of\r\nthe 24-nautical-mile limit laid down in article 33,\r\nparagraph 2. We therefore call on these States to\r\nharmonize their domestic legislation with the Convention.\r\nWe are pleased with the results of the increased\r\ninter-agency cooperation that now exists in the field of\r\nthe oceans. The report of the Secretary-General in\r\ndocument A/52/491, which contains the replies received\r\nfrom organizations and bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem, is most welcome and it is our hope that its\r\nissuance becomes a regular practice. We wish to\r\nemphasize the importance of coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and the specialized agencies, particularly\r\nthe International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,\r\nwhich both have specific roles to play under the\r\nConvention.\r\nOn the question of the International Maritime\r\nOrganization, my delegation is delighted to have been\r\nelected as a member of the Council of the IMO. South\r\nAfrica wishes to thank all delegations for their valuable\r\nassistance in this regard and undertakes to play a\r\nconstructive role in the field of maritime navigation.\r\nSouth Africa welcomes the increase to 15 of the\r\nnumber of States parties to the Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks — the so-called Fish Stocks Agreement. We note\r\nthat, little more than one year ago, there were only three\r\nStates parties to the Agreement and that, given a similar\r\nincrease in ratifications or accessions during 1998, it is\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 56th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\ncertainly foreseeable that the Agreement can enter into\r\nforce early in 1999. For its part, South Africa is positively\r\ndisposed towards the Fish Stocks Agreement and is\r\ncurrently considering accession in the near future. As such,\r\nmy delegation is pleased to support the draft resolution on\r\nthe Fish Stocks Convention, as contained in document\r\nA/52/L.29.\r\nIllegal foreign fishing in South Africa’s territorial\r\nwaters and its exclusive economic zone, particularly in the\r\narea surrounding the Prince Edward Islands, continues and\r\nis a cause of great concern for South Africa. With this in\r\nmind, a Marine Living Resources Bill has been introduced\r\ninto Parliament and is scheduled to be debated during 1998.\r\nThe Bill aims to provide for the conservation of the marine\r\necosystem, the long-term sustainable utilization of marine\r\nliving resources and the protection and orderly\r\naccess to exploitation of certain marine living resources.\r\nIn addition, it will repeal the existing quota board and\r\nreplace it with a State-owned company which will sell or\r\nlease rights of access to fish on a tender basis. Moreover,\r\nthe Bill provides for fines of up to $1 million for\r\ncontravention of the measures. In addition, South Africa\r\nsome time ago outlawed the use of drift-net fishing in\r\nareas under its national jurisdiction. Unfortunately, it\r\nappears that the worldwide moratorium on the use of\r\ndrift-nets is not being universally enforced. We must,\r\ntherefore, remain vigilant and continue highlighting this\r\nparticular problem. In this regard, South Africa strongly\r\nsupports the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/52/L.30 and hopes that it can be adopted without a\r\nvote.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that South Africa\r\nattaches great importance to all matters relating to oceans\r\nand the law of the sea. With a coastline stretching for\r\nalmost 3,000 kilometres along a busy sea route and the\r\nfact that a large proportion of its population lives on or\r\nnear the coast, South Africa places great emphasis on the\r\nfuture well-being of the world’s oceans. As we approach\r\nthe International Year of the Ocean in 1998, we need to\r\ntake collective measures to prevent the continued\r\ndeterioration of the world’s oceans from land-based and\r\nvessel-based sources.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
