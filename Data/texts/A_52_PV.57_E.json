(Ukraine)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mwamba\r\nKapanga (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 39 (continued)\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\n(a) Law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/52/487,\r\nA/52/491)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/52/260)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/52/L.26, A/52/L.27)\r\n(b) Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/555)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.29)\r\n(c) Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized\r\nfishing in zones of national jurisdiction and\r\nfisheries by-catch and discards\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/557)\r\nDraft resolution (A/52/L.30)\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): I have the honour, on\r\nbehalf of States members of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) — Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas,\r\nBarbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti,\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and my own\r\ncountry, Jamaica — to speak on agenda item 39, “Oceans\r\nand the law of the sea”.\r\nThe States members of the Caribbean Community all\r\nhave strong maritime traditions and a natural interest in\r\nmatters relating to the law of the sea and ocean affairs.\r\nWe participated actively in the processes leading up to the\r\nadoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea and to the establishment of important organs\r\nincluding the International Seabed Authority, the\r\nInternational Tribunal on the Law of the Sea and the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. We\r\nare pleased that these organs are now fully operational\r\nand have commenced their work, and we will continue to\r\ngive full support to their activities and to the attainment\r\nof the objectives of the Convention.\r\nStates members of CARICOM thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the comprehensive reports contained in\r\ndocuments A/52/260, A/52/487, A/52/491, A/52/555 and\r\nA/52/557, and we wish to express appreciation to the\r\nLegal Counsel and to the staff of the Division for Ocean\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea for their work and for the\r\nassistance they have given to delegations.\r\nWe are very pleased that the International Seabed\r\nAuthority has made good progress in its work. The drafting\r\nof a mining code is at an advanced stage and should be\r\ncompleted by the next session of the Assembly of the\r\nAuthority in Kingston, Jamaica. A historic point was\r\nreached at the August 1997 session of the International\r\nSeabed Authority when the Authority approved the plans of\r\nwork submitted by seven pioneer investors. We pay tribute\r\nto the first President of the Authority’s Assembly,\r\nAmbassador Djalal of Indonesia, and to the first President\r\nof the Authority’s Council, Mr. Lennox Ballah of Trinidad\r\nand Tobago, for the able manner in which they led the\r\npioneering work of these important bodies of the Authority.\r\nWe also commend the Secretary-General of the Authority,\r\nMr. Nandan, for the direction and leadership that he\r\ncontinues to give to the secretariat of the Authority as it\r\napproaches the challenging tasks before it.\r\nCaribbean Community delegations welcome the\r\nconclusion of a relationship agreement between the\r\nsecretariat of the International Seabed Authority and the\r\nUnited Nations. The agreement is before the General\r\nAssembly as an annex to draft resolution A/52/L.27, and\r\nwe invite delegations to give full support to that draft\r\nresolution.\r\nThe Authority has also requested membership in the\r\nUnited Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, and we also urge\r\nthe Assembly to support fully this proposal when it comes\r\nup for consideration.\r\nDelegations of the Caribbean Community note with\r\nsatisfaction that the international Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea, under the presidency of His Excellency\r\nMr. Thomas Mensah, has commenced its work in a\r\npractical way, and now has before it a matter for\r\ndetermination.\r\nOur delegations recognize that certain law of the sea\r\nissues and issues of the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment are interrelated. We recognize especially the\r\nimportant and related efforts in the context of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme, Agenda 21 and the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, to which\r\nour delegations attach great importance. We are particularly\r\nconcerned about the pollution of the marine environment\r\nand welcome the attention paid to this issue in draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.26.\r\nThe 29 countries that border the wider Caribbean\r\nregion depend upon the health of the coastal zone for\r\nfood, recreation and livelihood. We have taken steps to\r\nguard against pollution in one of the world’s most popular\r\nbodies of water and in its sensitive marine ecosystems.\r\nThrough the Caribbean Environment Programme, the\r\nparties to the Convention for the Protection and\r\nDevelopment of the Marine Environment of the Wider\r\nCaribbean Region have focused on the development of\r\nactivities related to the development of the Protocol on\r\nLand-based Sources of Marine Pollution Protocol, the\r\nGlobal Plan of Action and the Protocol concerning\r\nSpecially Protected Areas and Wildlife, and of activities\r\non the conservation of coastal ecosystems, with its\r\nlinkages to the private and tourism sectors.\r\nWe recognize the advances made in dealing with\r\nliving marine resources, notably provisions relating to\r\nstraddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.\r\nOur delegations strongly support ongoing efforts to ensure\r\nthat these resources are exploited in an appropriate\r\nmanner, with due regard to the rights of all States under\r\nthe Convention and related agreements.\r\nWith the establishment of the principal organs of the\r\nConvention, which cover vital areas of global concern in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Convention, the\r\ndebate in the General Assembly on the law of the sea\r\nprovides an important vehicle for ensuring that all\r\nelements of the Convention and activities thereunder are\r\naddressed in a coherent manner. The functions of the\r\nInternational Tribunal on the Law of the Sea in the area\r\nof the interpretation of the Convention and the\r\nadjudication of disputes thereunder, the duties of the\r\ninternational Seabed Authority in matters affecting the\r\ndeep seabed and areas beyond national jurisdiction and\r\nthe work of the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf represent new and important dimensions\r\nin the implementation of the Convention. These are\r\nprincipal mechanisms for carrying out the objectives of\r\nthe Convention. These bodies provide for the\r\ncomprehensive handling of law of the sea issues in a\r\ncomplementary way within their respective areas of\r\ncompetence, thus avoiding unnecessary duplication and\r\nensuring cost-effectiveness.\r\nOur delegations also believe that the debate in the\r\nGeneral Assembly can serve the useful purpose of\r\nassisting States parties, particularly developing countries,\r\nin conforming with their obligations and in maximizing\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nthe benefits which can arise from the implementation of the\r\nConvention.\r\nDelegations of the Caribbean Community welcome the\r\nongoing dialogue in relevant forums on the transfer by sea\r\nof hazardous wastes and nuclear fuel. These are issues of\r\nconcern to all island States and to all coastal States which\r\noccupy sensitive and ecologically vulnerable maritime\r\nspaces. We expect the relevant bodies, particularly the\r\nInternational Maritime Organization and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency, to give due consideration to the\r\nconcerns of States through whose waters these potentially\r\ndangerous items are transported.\r\nAs we prepare for the celebration in 1998 of the\r\nInternational Year of the Ocean, CARICOM delegations\r\nurge States that have not yet done so to become parties to\r\nthe Convention and the Agreement, so that we may achieve\r\nthe goal of universal participation as we seek to preserve\r\nthe common heritage of mankind.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): The date 10 December\r\n1997 marks the fifteenth anniversary of the signing of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I had\r\nthe honour to be a member of the Ukrainian delegation at\r\nthe signing ceremony at Montego Bay, Jamaica, on that\r\nwonderful sunny day. No one who was present will ever\r\nforget the exciting atmosphere of accomplishment, hope and\r\nexhilaration.\r\nThe Convention is indisputably one of the major\r\nachievements of the United Nations. It is an outstanding\r\nmultilateral instrument that holds great promise for the\r\nmaintenance of peace, an equitable basis for sharing the\r\nresources of the world’s oceans and a means of securing\r\neconomic and social progress for all the peoples of the\r\nEarth.\r\nThe Convention is also an important means for\r\npromoting the economic and social development of all\r\nStates. By dealing with such diverse and complex subjects\r\nas navigation or overflight, fishing and exploitation of\r\nmarine mineral resources, conservation and prevention of\r\npollution, it provides a framework for joint action on the\r\npath to development.\r\nSeveral delegations have already emphasized that at\r\nthe present session the item on the law of the sea has been\r\nexpanded to include all ocean issues. The wider mandate is\r\nevidence of the importance Member States attach to the\r\npresentation of a global overview of these issues to the\r\nAssembly. Indeed, the General Assembly is the only global\r\ninstitution with the competence to conduct such a\r\ncomprehensive annual review.\r\nDocument A/52/487 contains the report on oceans\r\nand the law of the sea prepared by the Secretary-General,\r\nwho has been assigned a special responsibility in these\r\nmatters by the Convention. The annual report gives us an\r\nexcellent opportunity to concentrate our attention on and\r\ndiscuss all issues relating to the oceans in a holistic\r\nmanner.\r\nThe oversight role of the General Assembly is\r\nexpected to assume yet greater significance with universal\r\nacceptance of the Convention and to be further\r\nconsolidated by the addition of the new law of the sea\r\ninstitutions to the wider group of international\r\norganizations responsible for various specialized aspects\r\nof ocean affairs.\r\nIt gives us pleasure to note the progress of the work\r\nof the International Seabed Authority. Last year it\r\ncompleted its initial organizational phase, and this year it\r\ncommenced its functional phase. The most significant\r\ndevelopment during 1997 was the approval of plans of\r\nwork for exploration of seven registered pioneer investors.\r\nWith the election of the Commission on the Limits\r\nof the Continental Shelf, the creation of three institutions\r\nmandated by the Convention is now complete.\r\nThere are three important issues on which the\r\nCommission requires advice from the Meeting of States\r\nParties to the Convention. The first is how the\r\nCommission should handle a submission by a coastal\r\nState which may involve a delimitation dispute. Another\r\nis the issue of confidentiality and the protection of\r\nmembers of the Commission from possible financial\r\nliability arising from potential allegations of a breach of\r\nthe rules of confidentiality. The delegation of Ukraine is\r\nof the view that the members of the Commission should\r\nbe considered to be experts on mission for the United\r\nNations under article VI of the Convention on the\r\nPrivileges and Immunities of the United Nations. The\r\nthird issue is whether the terms “coastal State” and\r\n“State”, used in article 4 of annex II to the Law of the\r\nSea Convention, include a non-State-party to the\r\nConvention. We hope that at their next Meeting the States\r\nparties will be able to consider and decide on these\r\nimportant issues.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to thank Ambassador\r\nHelmut Tuerk of Austria, who, in his capacity as\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nPresident of the seventh Meeting of the States Parties,\r\nbriefed the General Assembly on the progress of work at\r\nthe Meeting and also referred to the items to be considered\r\nat the next Meeting. It is quite obvious that the bridge\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Meeting was long\r\noverdue, and we are pleased that it has finally been\r\nestablished.\r\nThe Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the\r\nSea of the Office of Legal Affairs (DOALOS), by virtue of\r\nthe special responsibilities of the Secretary-General under\r\nthe Convention and the oversight role of the General\r\nAssembly, is required to review and monitor all\r\ndevelopments relating to the law of the sea and ocean\r\naffairs. The Convention provides for Meetings of States\r\nParties to be convened by the Secretary-General. The\r\nMeeting has come to be regarded as an important\r\ncomponent of the new system of ocean institutions,\r\nparticularly in giving advice with regard to the\r\ninterpretation of provisions of the Convention. We welcome\r\nthis development.\r\nWhile the Authority, the Tribunal and the Commission\r\nwill all deal with specific aspects of ocean affairs and the\r\nlaw of the sea, the central programme on oceans at the\r\nUnited Nations concentrates on matters related to the\r\noverall implementation of the Convention. It focuses on the\r\nmonitoring of State and regional practices and provides\r\ninformation, advice and assistance on the uniform and\r\nconsistent application of the Convention in many fields of\r\ninterest and concern for States and for international\r\norganizations. We share the views on these matters\r\ncontained in the annual report of the Secretary-General.\r\nFor many years the General Assembly has repeatedly\r\nexpressed its appreciation for the necessary and important\r\ntasks performed by the staff of the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea. In this connection, we\r\ncannot comprehend why the Office of Legal Affairs has\r\nreduced the number of Professional posts in the Division\r\nfrom 23 to 17 — a reduction of 26 per cent — and the\r\nGeneral Service staff from 13 to 10 — a reduction of 23\r\nper cent — when reductions on a similar scale were not\r\nproposed in other units of the Legal Office.\r\nAlthough it is understandable that the financial\r\nsituation of the Organization and the commitment of the\r\nSecretary-General to a reduction of 1,000 posts have forced\r\na cutback of personnel, the question arises whether such a\r\nmarked reduction in the Division’s staffing is justified. To\r\nillustrate one of the reasons for our concern, we would like\r\nto draw attention to a previous report [A/CONF.62/L.65] of\r\nthe Secretary-General, prepared back in 1981, entitled\r\n“Potential financial implications for States parties to the\r\nfuture convention on the law of the sea”. Paragraph 48\r\nstated in reference to the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf, currently serviced by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral:\r\n“To provide the necessary support\r\nservices to the Commission, a secretariat\r\ncomprising the following staff may be needed:\r\n1 principal officer, 5 Professional and 6\r\nGeneral Service staff members.”\r\nThat was in reference only — I emphasize “only” —\r\nto the secretariat servicing of the Commission, and not to\r\nany other functions of the unit, which eventually became\r\nthe Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea. It\r\ncould be argued that the Commission was only recently\r\nelected and that there are still no submissions under\r\nconsideration. I remind representatives that until last\r\nmonth there were also no cases before the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea. The question arises\r\nwhether at its current reduced staffing level the important\r\nfunctions of the Commission will be sufficiently\r\nsupported when submissions begin to arrive? Will the\r\nDivision’s current staffing level allow all its other\r\nimportant functions to be properly executed?\r\nI would like, through you, Mr. President, to ask the\r\nFifth Committee to consider again the issue of the proper\r\nstaffing level of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the\r\nLaw of the Sea, and I call upon all delegations to support\r\nthis action.\r\nAt the present session we are also considering\r\ndevelopments in the field of the conservation and\r\nmanagement of living marine resources. As always, we\r\nfind the relevant reports very useful. They will serve us\r\nas effective tools in conducting any advanced research on\r\nthese subjects.\r\nThe issues of fisheries and navigation are extremely\r\nimportant to Ukraine. In managing its long-distance\r\nfisheries, Ukraine cooperates with the coastal States on\r\nissues of conservation and the rational utilization of living\r\nresources. The protection of the marine environment and\r\neffective and balanced conservation remain priorities for\r\nUkraine.\r\nIn Ukraine, the National Programme for the\r\nDevelopment of Sea and River Transportation is about to\r\nbe adopted. One of its goals is to improve national\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nstandards for the safety of navigation. Ukraine is in the\r\nprocess of certifying training centres, and intends to submit\r\nto the International Maritime Organization all relevant\r\ninformation regarding the new national system of training\r\nand certification of sailors.\r\nThe National System for the Registration of Vessels,\r\ncurrently at the drafting stage, is designed to define the\r\nobligations of owners of ships flying the Ukrainian flag.\r\nUkraine is in the process of issuing national certificates to\r\nshipping companies as well as to vessels. It intends to\r\nbecome a full-fledged participant in the unified system of\r\nEuropean internal transportation waterways. Ukraine has\r\nsigned 13 bilateral treaties on trade navigation and 6\r\nintergovernmental agreements on fisheries.\r\nUkraine is engaged in active cooperation with regional\r\nfisheries organizations and bodies dealing with the\r\nconservation of marine living resources. We are interested\r\nin developing cooperation with the North-East Atlantic\r\nFisheries Commission and the North-West Atlantic\r\nFisheries Organization.\r\nUkraine is working on a solution to the problem of\r\nunregulated fisheries in the River Danube. We consider\r\nvital the restoration of the activities of the Commission\r\nwhich was established on the basis of the 1958 Convention\r\nConcerning Fishing in the Waters of the Danube.\r\nIt gives me pleasure to convey to this forum that there\r\nare very positive developments in the Black Sea region.\r\nThis year Ukraine took practical measures for the\r\nstabilization of the political situation in the area and for the\r\nimprovement of bilateral cooperation in the field of\r\ninternational security, including maritime affairs, with two\r\nof its neighbouring countries, the Russian Federation and\r\nRomania.\r\nThe Prime Ministers of the Russian Federation and\r\nUkraine signed three agreements on 28 May 1997 in Kiev\r\nregarding the Black Sea fleet. The information on these\r\nagreements is contained in paragraphs 370 to 373 of the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, document A/52/487. The\r\nconclusion of the agreements resolved the problem of\r\nownership of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet. These and\r\nother agreements made it possible for the Presidents of the\r\ntwo countries to sign a comprehensive Treaty on\r\nFriendship, Cooperation and Partnership, which also refers\r\nto cooperation in the Black Sea region. Under the\r\nagreements, Russia will lease from Ukraine several Crimean\r\nbays, as well as other facilities in the Crimea for a 20-year\r\nperiod.\r\nFollowing the signing of the Treaty on Neighbourly\r\nRelations and Cooperation by the Presidents of Ukraine\r\nand Romania on 2 June 1997 in Constanta, Romania, the\r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of the two countries, by an\r\nexchange of letters, concluded an Agreement defining the\r\nprinciples and procedures for the conclusion of a separate\r\nTreaty on the Regime of the State Frontier between the\r\ntwo countries. Under the Agreement, the Governments of\r\nUkraine and Romania will negotiate another instrument:\r\nthe Agreement on Strengthening of Confidence and\r\nSecurity in the Zones Adjacent to the Common State\r\nFrontier. Within the framework of this Agreement, the\r\nGovernment of Ukraine will undertake not to deploy\r\noffensive armaments on Serpent Island, which, according\r\nto the Agreement of 2 June 1997, belongs to Ukraine.\r\nUkraine and Romania will also conduct negotiations\r\nto conclude an Agreement on the Delimitation of the\r\nContinental Shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zones of\r\nboth countries in the Black Sea, on the basis of the\r\nprinciples and procedures contained in, inter alia, article\r\n121 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea. The States parties will abstain from the exploitation\r\nof any mineral resources in the zone within which the\r\ndelimitation will be made until a decision on delimitation\r\nhas been reached.\r\nIf the Agreement on Delimitation is not concluded\r\nwithin two years from the beginning of negotiations, the\r\nGovernments of Ukraine and Romania agree that the\r\nmatter of the delimitation of the continental shelf and the\r\nexclusive economic zones shall be submitted to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice on the request of either\r\nState party, provided that by that time the Treaty on the\r\nRegime of the State Frontier between Romania and\r\nUkraine has already entered into force.\r\nUkraine has the honour of co-sponsoring the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/52/L.26, so ably\r\nintroduced by the representative of New Zealand. Ukraine\r\nis also co-sponsoring the draft resolution [A/52/L.29] on\r\nthe Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions\r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\r\nof 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Croatia): I have the honour to take\r\nthe floor on an agenda item of marked importance to my\r\ncountry. As a country with long traditions and a special\r\ninterest in maritime activities, Croatia has since its\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nindependence joined the effort of United Nations Member\r\nStates in promoting the law of the sea.\r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Croatia thanks the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on this\r\nagenda item. It enables the Member States and the General\r\nAssembly to review all the relevant developments relating\r\nto ocean affairs and the law of the sea.\r\nAfter the major achievements of the United Nations in\r\nthe codification and progressive development of the law of\r\nthe sea, constant review and evaluation of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea is the most important contribution of the\r\nOrganization to the international legal order of the oceans\r\nat present.\r\nIn achieving all the goals of the United Nations in the\r\nfield, the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the\r\nSea of the Office of Legal Affairs of the Secretariat has\r\nalways acted with outstanding expertise and devotion.\r\nAfter the entry into force of the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, the United Nations helped in the\r\nestablishment of the institutions provided for in the\r\nConvention: the International Seabed Authority, the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nDelegates from Croatia have participated in the work of the\r\nAuthority since the inaugural session in November 1994.\r\nFurthermore, Croatian experts have become members of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The\r\ndelegation of Croatia renews its expressions of gratitude to\r\nthe States parties to the Convention for having supported\r\nthose experts.\r\nAll of the three institutions which I have mentioned\r\nare now engaged in establishing their organs, elaborating\r\nthe rules of procedure and defining their relations with the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations.\r\nTaking into account the innovative character and the\r\nspecific features of their tasks, we can be satisfied with the\r\npace of their progress. Thus, for example, we can be\r\nsatisfied that the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea has already adopted the Rules of the Tribunal, the\r\nguidelines concerning the preparation and presentation of\r\ncases before the Tribunal, and the resolution on internal\r\njudicial practice. Moreover, our delegation acknowledges\r\nwith satisfaction that the United Nations and the Tribunal\r\nhave finalized the Draft Agreement on Cooperation and\r\nRelationships between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. The\r\nAgreement should be signed shortly by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the President of the Tribunal.\r\nWhen all these institutions complete their\r\npreparatory work, it is up to us — the States parties — to\r\nmake the best use of these institutions conceived at the\r\nThird United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea\r\nas the institutional framework for the international legal\r\norder of the oceans. As far as the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Law of the Sea is concerned, two States parties to\r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea have already\r\nagreed to come to the Tribunal in accordance with the\r\nspecial procedure for the prompt release of vessels.\r\nConcluding these brief remarks, I would like to point\r\nout the view of my delegation that in our activities\r\nrelative to the exploration, protection and exploitation of\r\nocean space, we should pay more attention to the benefit\r\nof mankind as a whole, and particularly to the progress of\r\nthe least developed countries and the protection of the\r\nmost endangered parts of our planet, than to short-term\r\ncost-effectiveness.\r\nMr. Gao Feng (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): At the outset, please allow me to express my\r\nappreciation for the remarkable results achieved at the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the\r\nAssembly of the International Seabed Authority. I would\r\nalso like to take this opportunity to thank all those who\r\nhave worked for the conferences, particularly the\r\nChairmen of the conferences and the members of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea and the Agreement relating to the Implementation of\r\nPart XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea adopted on 10 December 1982 constitute the\r\nbasic documents of the international community regarding\r\nmarine rights and interests and the order governing the\r\nocean space. These documents have established a legal\r\norder governing the ocean space which will contribute to\r\nthe exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the\r\nequitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and\r\nfacilitate the establishment of a just and equitable\r\ninternational economic order. China has actively\r\nparticipated not only in the drafting of the Convention but\r\nalso in the setting up of all the relevant organs under the\r\nConvention after its entry into force, including the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf and\r\nthe International Seabed Authority.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nFor the law of the sea, this has been an extraordinary\r\nyear that has witnessed a series of significant activities that\r\nlaid a foundation for the orderly and healthy development\r\nof maritime affairs in this century, and the next as well.\r\nThe Sixth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention, held\r\nlast March, elected 21 inaugural members of the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. Mr.\r\nWenzheng Lu of China was honoured to be among them.\r\nWe are confident that they will make outstanding\r\ncontributions to the delimitation of the outer limits of the\r\ncontinental shelf.\r\nAs a major outcome of the development of the law of\r\nthe sea, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea,\r\nestablished in accordance with the provisions of annex VI\r\nof the Convention, is the first international judicial organ\r\ndedicated to the settlement of maritime disputes. Last year\r\nthe membership of the Tribunal was elected. This year\r\nelections were carried out for the Seabed Disputes\r\nChamber, the Chamber for Fisheries Disputes and the\r\nChamber for Marine Environment Disputes. The\r\ncomposition of the Tribunal represents all the major legal\r\nsystems of the world and reflects equitable geographical\r\ndistribution. We believe that the Tribunal will play an\r\nimportant role in the settlement of relevant maritime\r\ndisputes.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority is an organ\r\ndedicated to the management of the seabed and ocean floor\r\nand subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national\r\njurisdiction — the Area — as well as its resources. The\r\nArea and its resources are the common heritage of\r\nmankind, the exploration and exploitation of which are\r\nentirely in the interest of mankind. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has been active in all aspects of the work of\r\nthe Authority. As a member of group B of the Council of\r\nthe Authority, China has also sent its experts to take part in\r\nthe work of the Finance Committee of the Authority and\r\nthe Legal and Technical Commission. During the second\r\nphase of the third session of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, held last August, the Council of the Authority\r\napproved the exploration plans submitted by the pioneer\r\ninvestors, which represents a milestone in the history of the\r\nAuthority and shows that the work of the Authority has\r\nevolved from the procedural and organizational phase to the\r\nsubstantive phase of operation management. With the\r\napproval of its exploration plan, China has become one of\r\nthe first contractors of the Authority. China will continue\r\nfaithfully to fulfil its obligations as a pioneer investor and\r\nmake important contributions to the exploration and\r\nexploitation of the international seabed Area. Meanwhile,\r\nChina will, as always, continue its participation in all\r\naspects of the work of the International Seabed Authority\r\nand engage in relevant international cooperation so as to\r\nfacilitate the exploration and exploitation of international\r\nseabed resources.\r\nIn an effort to safeguard the maritime rights and\r\ninterests of coastal States, as provided for in the\r\nConvention, China has continuously improved its\r\ndomestic legislation on the ocean space. After the\r\npromulgation of the Act of the People’s Republic of\r\nChina on the Territorial Sea and Areas Adjacent to It, the\r\nChinese Government declared, in May 1996, the\r\ndelimitation of certain portions of the baselines of the\r\nterritorial sea of the main continent and the baseline of\r\nthe Xisha Islands. To give effect to its sovereign right and\r\njurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone and\r\ncontinental shelf, China is actively engaged in the\r\nformulation of an act of the People’s Republic of China\r\non the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf.\r\nWith regard to the overlapping claims by neighbouring\r\nStates with adjacent or opposite coasts over exclusive\r\neconomic zones or continental shelves, the Chinese\r\nGovernment is in favour of seeking proper solutions\r\nthrough peaceful negotiations in accordance with well-\r\nestablished international law and the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. At present, China has\r\nstarted consultations with the countries concerned on\r\nquestions relating to the law of the sea as well as the\r\ndelimitation of the sea area and fisheries, and positive\r\nresults have been achieved. Through consultation and\r\ndialogue, the countries concerned have enhanced mutual\r\nunderstanding and trust. This has contributed to the\r\ndevelopment of relations between China and those\r\ncountries.\r\nThe twenty-first century is one in which mankind\r\nwill embrace the sea with all its potentials. With the\r\ndevelopment of science and technology, humanity will be\r\nfaced with opportunities to obtain much more in terms of\r\nresources and energy from the sea, as well as tremendous\r\nchallenges to protect the environment, achieve the\r\nsustainable development of the sea and maintain optimal\r\nharmony between humanity and nature. All countries\r\nshould, in a spirit of mutual understanding and\r\ncooperation, strengthen their interaction so as to\r\ncontribute to the well-being and progress of mankind as\r\na whole.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to point out that there is a mistake contained\r\nin this year’s report of the Secretary-General on the Law\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nof the Sea of this year, document A/52/487, dated 20\r\nOctober 1997. In paragraph 264 it mentions:\r\n“such agreements, including an agreement between\r\nChina and Japan for joint exploration and development\r\nof an island group in the East China Sea”.\r\nThis description is at variance with the facts. The truth\r\nof the matter is that there is no such agreement between\r\nChina and Japan involving joint exploration and\r\ndevelopment of non-living resources of an island group in\r\nthe East China Sea. The Chinese delegation requests that\r\nthe phrase\r\n“an agreement between China and Japan for joint\r\nexploration and development of an island group in the\r\nEast China Sea”\r\nbe deleted from paragraph 264 of the report, that the United\r\nNations Secretariat issue a corrigendum to that effect and\r\nthat this clarification be included in the Official Records of\r\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): My delegation welcomes the\r\ncomprehensive and informative reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on matters relating to the law of the sea and ocean\r\naffairs. We are pleased to co-sponsor the omnibus draft\r\nresolution on the law of the sea, as well as the draft\r\nresolution on the Agreement concerning the Relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and the International Seabed\r\nAuthority and on the question of the Seabed Authority\r\nparticipating in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension\r\nFund. The last matter is of course still subject to the\r\nconsideration of the Fifth Committee.\r\nIndia is naturally interested in maritime matters and\r\nocean affairs, given our geography, with its 4,000-mile\r\ncoastline and 1,300 islands. India has had a great maritime\r\ntradition as a civilization. Our ancient and medieval history\r\nrecords extensive trade between India and Arab countries\r\non the one hand, and the States of South-East Asia on the\r\nother, as well as with Africa. Large populations on our\r\ncoasts and on the islands of Andaman, Nicobar and\r\nLakshadweep have always depended on the sea for\r\nsustenance. Both before and after its independence, India\r\nhas taken active part in the development and codification of\r\nthe law of the sea, and participated in the First United\r\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea, in Geneva, and\r\nin the Third Conference. We have invested heavily in the\r\nexploration of minerals in the deep seabed and in the\r\nexploitation of petroleum resources and hydrocarbons in our\r\nterritorial waters and exclusive economic zone.\r\nWe welcome the entry into force of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as well as the\r\nAgreement relating to the Implementation of part XI\r\nthereof, as contributing to the peaceful order of oceans.\r\nThose States that have not yet become parties to the\r\nConvention will, we hope, soon be able to do so to make\r\nthis legal regime really universal. It is a matter of great\r\nsatisfaction that all the institutions envisaged under the\r\nConvention — namely, the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea and the Commission on the Limits of the Continental\r\nShelf — have all been established. The task now is to see\r\nthat they discharge their assigned functions effectively\r\nand efficiently.\r\nTurning now to the work of the International Seabed\r\nAuthority, I would like first to congratulate its Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Ambassador Satya Nandan, for his leadership of\r\nthe organization. Our appreciation also goes to the first\r\nPresident of the Council of the Authority, Ambassador\r\nLennox Ballah of Trinidad and Tobago, for the wisdom\r\nwith which he has led the complex deliberations of the\r\nCouncil in the last two years. This year the Authority\r\ntook the historic decision of granting its approval to the\r\nplans of work for exploration of mine sites submitted by\r\nthe registered pioneer investors. As a registered pioneer\r\ninvestor, India was granted approval for the plan of work\r\nfor exploration of the mine site in the Indian Ocean which\r\nit registered with the United Nations. This should now\r\nlead to the granting of contracts by the Secretary-General\r\nof the Authority for exploration of the mine sites by the\r\ninvestors. India has fulfilled its obligations under the\r\nConvention, the Agreement relating to the Implementation\r\nof Part XI and resolution II of the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Law of the Sea and is thus eligible to\r\nobtain a contract for exploration of its mine site.\r\nThe other important aspect relates to the elaboration\r\nof a draft Mining Code by the Authority. During its last\r\nmeeting, the Legal and Technical Commission of the\r\nAuthority prepared a full text of the Mining Code and\r\nsubmitted it to the Council in August 1997. Member\r\nGovernments may provide written comments on the\r\nprovisional text of the Mining Code by 31 December\r\n1997, so that the Commission can take those comments\r\ninto consideration in finalizing the Mining Code at the\r\nnext meeting, thus readying it for adoption by the Council\r\nand the Authority. The issue of contracts for exploration\r\nand the adoption of the Mining Code together constitute\r\nthe most important substantive basis for the functions of\r\nthe International Seabed Authority to be carried out.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nFurther, on the institutional front, the Seabed\r\nAuthority, on the basis of the work of its Finance\r\nCommittee, agreed on the United Nations scale of\r\nassessments and prepared its first regular budget in the\r\nmodest sum of $4.7 million, and established a Working\r\nCapital Fund of $196,000 in 1998 and a similar amount in\r\n1999. The last date for making these payments is 30 days\r\nfrom the time the Authority sends the notice or 1 January\r\n1998, whichever is later. Given the fact that this is the\r\nstart-up period for the Authority, we only hope that the\r\nassessed contributions will be paid on time and in full,\r\nwithout any conditionalities, by all members.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the observer status of the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority in the United Nations, and\r\nthe signing of the Agreement concerning the Relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and the International Seabed\r\nAuthority by the two Secretaries-General. Finally, my\r\ndelegation assures the Secretary-General of the Authority\r\nand its host State, Jamaica, a country with which we have\r\nvery close ties, of our full cooperation.\r\nTurning now to the International Tribunal for the Law\r\nof the Sea, we are glad to note that under the leadership of\r\nthe President of the Tribunal, Judge Thomas Mensa of\r\nGhana, the Tribunal has finalized its rules of procedure and\r\nis even now seized of a case. The last Meeting of States\r\nParties, held in New York, approved the budget of the\r\nTribunal as well as the draft Agreement on the Privileges\r\nand Immunities of the International Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea. With the completion of the Headquarters\r\nAgreement between the Tribunal and the Host Country\r\n(Germany), the Tribunal is now adequately equipped to\r\nattend to its functions.\r\nIn its first two meetings, the Commission on the\r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf has been working, among\r\nother things, on its rules of procedure. We are sure the\r\nCommission, being a technical body, will devise rules of\r\nprocedure that will not involve the Commission in matters\r\ndisputed between States, for it is well known that the\r\nConvention provides separately for dispute settlement\r\nmechanisms, and the Commission is not one of them.\r\nTurning to fisheries issues, we consider the 1995\r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10\r\nDecember 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks a landmark in the implementation of\r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea. In our view, the\r\nimplementation of the Agreement should guarantee the\r\nenforcement of the rights of the coastal States while\r\ntaking into account the interests of distant-waters fishing\r\nnations. The developing countries should be supported\r\ntechnically and financially for the development of their\r\nfisheries, as envisaged in articles 24 and 25 of the\r\nAgreement. India is committed, along with the other\r\nIndian Ocean coastal States, to conserving, managing and\r\nprotecting Indian Ocean tuna from indiscriminate fishing\r\nand consequential depletion or eventual extinction of\r\nstocks. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, to which\r\nIndia is a party, is starting its functions only now. It is\r\nour view that artisanal and small-scale fisheries should be\r\nprotected in view of their social, economic and cultural\r\nimportance, and also because this is essentially\r\nsubsistence fishery that is not commercial in nature.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to welcome\r\nthe Independent World Commission on the Oceans, which\r\nwas founded on the initiative of Mr. Mário Soares, the\r\nformer President of Portugal. We look forward to the\r\nCommission’s recommendations, which we believe should\r\nonly add to and support the legal regime envisaged in the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\r\nwithout in any manner attempting to reopen the regime.\r\nIndia will also participate in the Ocean Expo in Lisbon in\r\n1998. We support the proclamation of 1998 as the\r\nInternational Year of the Ocean.\r\nFinally, the very preamble of the 1982 Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea recognized that all problems of\r\nocean States are closely interrelated, and article 319\r\nspecifically maintained that the Secretary-General should\r\nmonitor and review the issues of the law of the sea and\r\nocean affairs and report on them to the General\r\nAssembly. The central role of the United Nations should\r\ncontinue, as reaffirmed in resolution 49/28, in active\r\nengagement with the functional organizations under the\r\nConvention. A healthy relationship between the United\r\nNations and the specialized law of the sea institutions\r\nestablished under the 1982 Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea should be nurtured from now onward to ensure\r\npeaceful and orderly management of the oceans and\r\nmaritime resources, for the benefit of mankind as a\r\nwhole.\r\nMr. Yacoubou (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nIn participating in the debate on this agenda item,\r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”, my delegation would\r\nlike to reaffirm that it attaches great importance to this\r\nissue. Indeed, the seas and oceans are an essential part of\r\nour geophysical environment and of the framework of our\r\neconomic and social life.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nThree years ago the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea entered into force. More than 120 States\r\nhave already ratified, accepted or acceded to it. This shows\r\nthe relevance of its provisions, the ever-increasing\r\nawareness by States of the daily threats to the marine and\r\ncoastal environment and the need to ensure balanced and\r\neffective conservation of its biological and other resources.\r\nBy adopting the United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea on 10 December 1992 at Montego Bay,\r\nJamaica, the Member States of the United Nations took a\r\nfundamental step for the benefit of peace and development.\r\nThe provisions of the Convention deal with the essential\r\naspects of maritime activities concerning coastal or\r\nlandlocked States. Similarly, they define the rights and\r\nobligations of the States parties in this matter.\r\nThe Convention is unquestionably an essential\r\ncontribution to the codification and management of the\r\nproblems of the marine and coastal environment. The new\r\ninternational legal order it embodies will promote, with\r\neffective implementation, the fair and efficient management\r\nof the common heritage of mankind represented by the\r\nresources of the seabed. This new legal regime will also\r\ncontribute to ensuring the promotion of peaceful uses of the\r\nseas and oceans.\r\nThere is a collective will to work to strengthen the\r\nlegal basis of the treatment of the seas and oceans and to\r\nassure their sound and rational management, and Benin is\r\npart of it; on 16 October 1997 it ratified the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, and it will continue its\r\nefforts to honour its commitment to comply with the\r\nprovisions of the Convention.\r\nI am pleased to recall that as part of its policy for the\r\npreservation and protection of nature — specifically the\r\nmarine environment in this instance — Benin organized a\r\nnational workshop on the management of the maritime\r\necosystems of the Gulf of Guinea, held in Cotonou at the\r\nbeginning of July 1997. Co-sponsored by the World Bank,\r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme, the United\r\nNations Development Programme, through the Global\r\nEnvironment Facility, and the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization, this workshop enabled officials\r\nof national services at various levels, those involved in the\r\nchain of activities in ports and on the seas, and\r\nrepresentatives of coastal populations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and professional organizations, to study\r\ntogether the problems affecting the management of the\r\nmajor marine ecosystems of the Gulf of Guinea.\r\nThe Government of Benin would like, through me,\r\nto express its great gratitude to the institutions, funds and\r\nprogrammes which support its efforts to preserve and\r\nprotect its marine environment, and we invite them to\r\ncontinue to do so.\r\nThe delegation of Benin studied with great interest\r\nthe excellent comprehensive annual report presented by\r\nthe Secretary-General on the law of the sea and the\r\nactivities of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law\r\nof the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs. We are pleased\r\nwith the quality of this document and the information\r\nprovided in other documents dealing with related\r\nquestions.\r\nThe establishment of the main institutions provided\r\nfor in the Convention and the various activities carried\r\nout by them and other competent United Nations bodies\r\nshow that a good start has been made in implementing the\r\nConvention.\r\nThe signing on 14 March 1997 of the Agreement\r\nconcerning the Relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the International Seabed Authority is a sign of the\r\nAuthority’s willingness to strengthen its cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations and its Member States. My delegation\r\ntherefore strongly recommends that the General Assembly\r\napprove the conclusion of this Agreement.\r\nMr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam): I am happy to\r\naddress the Assembly on this agenda item, “Oceans and\r\nthe law of the sea”, which for years has been of great\r\ninterest and significance to Viet Nam.\r\nI could not begin without expressing our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive reports contained in documents A/52/487,\r\nA/52/491 and A/52/557. Our appreciation is also extended\r\nto the Secretariat — particularly the Division for Ocean\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal\r\nAffairs — as well as the secretariat of the International\r\nSeabed Authority for their contribution on the question of\r\noceans and the law of the sea this year.\r\nThe year 1997 has witnessed significant and positive\r\ndevelopments in ocean affairs and the law of the sea. The\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of\r\n1982 has now been ratified by some 120 countries. This\r\nincreasing number of ratifications indicates the\r\nfundamental importance of the Convention, particularly in\r\nthe maintenance and strengthening of international peace\r\nand security, development and cooperation. Gradually, the\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nConvention is becoming one of the most universal\r\ninstruments in the world.\r\nWe are encouraged that the Agreement relating to the\r\nImplementation of Part XI of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly in July 1994, has received broader support from\r\nthe international community. We are also encouraged by the\r\nfact that a considerable number of States have lent their full\r\nsupport to the Agreement for the Implementation of the\r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation\r\nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, adopted in August 1995. We believe\r\nthat this Agreement must be interpreted and applied in the\r\ncontext of and in a manner consistent with the Convention.\r\nAs a coastal State with a broad continental shelf, Viet\r\nNam attaches great importance to the establishment of the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The\r\ninternational community successfully overcame differences\r\nand gave birth to this 21-member institution in March 1997.\r\nSince coming into being, the Commission has begun\r\nconsideration of its rules of procedure, which will be\r\ndecided by the Meetings of States Parties to the\r\nConvention. It is our view that with its mandate being\r\nclosely linked to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of coastal\r\nStates over their continental shelves, the functions and\r\nactivities of the Commission and its members must be in\r\naccordance with relevant stipulations in the Convention. In\r\nthe draft, those rules dealing with delimitation disputes\r\nbetween States, the issue of confidentiality and the liability\r\nof members of the Commission should be further studied\r\nand seriously considered.\r\nIn the meantime, our delegation also notes with\r\nsatisfaction that the other bodies established under the\r\nprovisions of the Convention have begun their activities and\r\nmade considerable achievements. We highly appreciate the\r\nresults obtained at the Meetings of States Parties to the\r\nConvention, above all the adoption of the 1998 budget for\r\nthe International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea and the\r\nAgreement on Privileges and Immunities of the\r\nInternational Tribunal on the Law of the Sea. It is our view\r\nthat the international community should find ways to\r\nheighten the role of these meetings, particularly in\r\nreviewing ocean affairs and law-of-the-sea issues.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority, moreover, has\r\nsuccessfully fulfilled its tasks. We welcome the approval of\r\nthe work plans for exploration by seven registered pioneer\r\ninvestors; the considerable results made in the elaboration\r\nof the Mining Code and, particularly, the signing and\r\nprovisional application of the Agreement concerning the\r\nRelationship between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority. Viet Nam has made\r\nconsiderable efforts to participate more actively in the\r\nwork of the Authority, as well as in the exploration of the\r\ndeep seabed.\r\nWe strongly support the achievements realized so far\r\nin the elaboration of legal texts, as well as the\r\norganizational work done by the international community,\r\nthe German Government and the International Tribunal on\r\nthe Law of the Sea itself to enable it to operate normally\r\nand effectively.\r\nIt is necessary to stress that those achievements were\r\npossible thanks to the efforts by the States parties to the\r\nConvention through their pursuit of a constructive\r\napproach and their responsible commitment to\r\nimplementing the Convention to make it universal and\r\neffective. In this process, Viet Nam has been making its\r\nactive contribution.\r\nWe consider it important that the international\r\ncommunity continue to make more efforts and take\r\nconcrete steps to support those newly established\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThe serious implementation of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, moreover, requires the\r\nstrict observance by States of the spirit as well as the\r\nletter of its provisions and articles. The Convention makes\r\nit obligatory for States, among other things, to respect the\r\nsovereignty of coastal States and their sovereign rights\r\nand jurisdiction over their continental shelves and\r\nexclusive economic zones, as provided for in the relevant\r\narticles of the Convention. States are required in their\r\nactions at both the global and the regional levels to abide\r\nstrictly by the provisions of the Convention.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea and other relevant instruments have enjoyed the\r\nstrong and effective support of the Government of Viet\r\nNam. In our view, the Convention is a framework for\r\nnational, regional and global activities in the maritime\r\nsector. We always welcome and actively participate in\r\nthose initiatives and efforts to implement the Convention\r\nand other relevant texts. Accordingly, we note with great\r\ninterest that the past year has been marked by an\r\nintensified call from the international community for a\r\ncoordinated and integrated approach to ocean affairs and\r\nlaw of the sea issues.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nIn its region, Viet Nam has been making tremendous\r\nefforts to promote dialogue and cooperative and friendly\r\nrelations with other countries. In the field of ocean affairs,\r\nfor example, Viet Nam signed with Thailand on\r\n9 August 1997 an agreement on the delimitation of\r\nmaritime boundaries between the two countries and, with\r\nthe Philippines, an agreement on the second cruise for joint\r\nscientific research in the Eastern Sea. At the same time,\r\nViet Nam has actively participated in other international\r\nand regional initiatives and arrangements on this subject.\r\nWe are confident that the aforementioned activities and\r\narrangements have effectively contributed to promoting\r\npeace, security and stability in the region.\r\nOn the question of the Eastern Sea, also known as the\r\nSouth China Sea, Viet Nam wishes to reconfirm its\r\nconsistent position. With regard to the territorial claims\r\nover the Paracel and Spratly Islands, Viet Nam has enough\r\nhistorical and legal evidence to assert its national\r\nsovereignty over them. That sovereignty is indisputable.\r\nRegarding existing disputes, it is our view that they\r\nshould be settled through peaceful negotiations in a spirit of\r\nequality, mutual understanding and respect for each other’s\r\nsovereignty and jurisdiction over respective continental\r\nshelves and exclusive economic zones, in accordance with\r\ninternational law, particularly the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. Moreover, the parties\r\nconcerned should, while making active efforts to promote\r\nnegotiations for a fundamental and long-term solution,\r\nmaintain stability based on the status quo and refrain from\r\nany act that may further complicate the situation and from\r\nthe use or threat of force. This is in conformity with the\r\nprinciples and norms of contemporary international law and\r\nthe aspirations of the peoples, and it serves peace and\r\nstability in the region.\r\nWe are confident that the Secretary-General will\r\nensure the continuing institutional capacity of the\r\nOrganization to respond adequately to the needs of States,\r\nnewly established institutions and other competent\r\ninternational organizations by providing advice and\r\nassistance, taking into account the special needs of\r\ndeveloping countries. Reports on developments and issues\r\nrelating to ocean affairs and the law of the sea should\r\ncontinue to be made to the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nthird session.\r\nI would like to conclude by recommending that an\r\nitem entitled “Oceans and the law of the sea” be included\r\nin the agenda of the fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Park (Republic of Korea): Let me begin by\r\nwelcoming the annual report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe oceans and the law of the sea, as contained in\r\ndocument A/52/487, and by commending the Secretariat\r\nfor its excellent work. This well-organized and\r\ncomprehensive report will facilitate the wide\r\ndissemination to Member States of information on the\r\nrecent developments relating to the oceans and the law of\r\nthe sea and will greatly contribute to enhancing the\r\npeaceful uses and stable order of the public ocean. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations, as a global institution,\r\nshould continue to play a central role in facilitating the\r\neffective implementation of the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and in bolstering\r\ninternational cooperation in the field of the law of the sea.\r\nWe also note with appreciation the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the impact of the entry into force of\r\nthe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea on related existing and proposed instruments and\r\nprogrammes. The report demonstrates how broad and\r\nprofound an impact the Convention has upon various\r\nrelated areas. My delegation hopes that the necessary\r\nmeasures mentioned in the report will be taken by\r\nrelevant regional and global organizations in an\r\nappropriate manner, as they will further consolidate the\r\norderly implementation of the new legal regime of the\r\noceans.\r\nAs a maritime country, Korea attaches great\r\nimportance to the maintenance of a peaceful and stable\r\nmaritime order. Because of its enormous potential as the\r\nplanet’s last frontier for mankind, the sea offers us\r\nimmense opportunities as well as challenges. Whether the\r\nsea’s bounty brings us prosperity or triggers conflict\r\nlargely depends on how the international community\r\nmaintains the public order of the ocean. Hence, it is\r\ncrucial for all of us to seek the universality of the\r\nConvention and its full implementation. While we are\r\npleased to note that, since November 1996, 14 States have\r\nadditionally acceded to the Convention, raising the total\r\nnumber of States parties to 122, this figure still falls short\r\nof meeting the test of universality. We therefore urge\r\nStates which have not yet done so to accede to the\r\nConvention as soon as possible.\r\nThis year marks the first year that various\r\ninstitutions established under the Convention have been\r\nbrought into full-fledged operation. At its resumed third\r\nsession last August, the International Seabed Authority\r\napproved plans of work for exploration activities of\r\nregistered pioneer investors. As one of the seven pioneer\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\ninvestors, Korea will faithfully carry out exploration\r\nactivities pursuant to the Convention and the Implementing\r\nAgreement. We also welcome the progress the Legal and\r\nTechnical Commission has achieved in the preparation of\r\nthe deep seabed mining code that will govern prospecting\r\nand exploration in the seabed and the ocean floor beyond\r\nthe limits of national jurisdiction. My delegation looks\r\nforward to a reliable and predictable operational regime on\r\ndeep seabed mining being worked out soon.\r\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has\r\nalso made great strides towards laying the groundwork for\r\njudicial functioning since its inauguration last year. The\r\nTribunal adopted three significant instruments governing its\r\ninternal procedures: the Rules of the Tribunal, the\r\nresolution on the Internal Judicial Practice, and Guidelines\r\nfor the Preparation and Presentation of Cases Before the\r\nTribunal. In this regard, we are pleased to note that the\r\nTribunal is already in operation to consider its first case\r\nthis month. It is our sincere hope that the Tribunal will\r\ncontinue to solidify its role as a principal judicial organ in\r\nthe area of the law of the sea.\r\nInstituted this year, the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf has concluded deliberations on its\r\nRules of Procedure. In our view, two annexes regarding a\r\nsubmission involving delimitation disputes and the issue of\r\nconfidentiality are very important to the effective\r\nfunctioning of the Commission. My delegation is prepared\r\nto participate actively in the discussion of these annexes\r\nduring the next Meeting of States Parties. In connection\r\nwith the request by the Commission for the Meeting of\r\nStates Parties to clarify whether the mandate of the\r\nCommission should extend to non-parties, however, we\r\nbelieve careful consideration is needed with regard to\r\nidentifying the most appropriate forum in which the issue\r\ncould be best addressed.\r\nAs a responsible fishing State, Korea is firmly\r\ncommitted to the sustainable development and use of the\r\nresources of the world ocean. In line with this policy, the\r\nRepublic of Korea signed last year the Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling\r\nFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. My\r\nGovernment is currently taking the necessary domestic\r\nsteps to ratify this Agreement.\r\nPending the domestic procedures for ratification,\r\nhowever, Korea has already put in place various voluntary\r\nmeasures to implement the Agreement. Korea has done its\r\ndue part to live up to the letter and spirit of the\r\nAgreement through the voluntary submission of fishing\r\nstatistics to relevant organizations, the scientific\r\nmonitoring and study of marine resources, and the\r\ndomestic adoption of fishing rules and regulations. Our\r\nactive participation in regional and subregional fishery\r\norganizations in the northern and southern Pacific, as well\r\nas in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, has also contributed\r\nto the implementation of the Agreement.\r\nFurthermore, Korea has faithfully complied with the\r\nglobal moratorium on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing.\r\nSince 1 January 1993, my Government has taken all\r\nnecessary measures to suspend all drift-net fishing\r\noperations by Korean fishing vessels. In addition, such\r\neffective measures as the education of fishermen and the\r\napplication of punitive action against violations have been\r\ntaken to ensure that no Korean fishing vessels engage in\r\nfishing in areas under the jurisdiction of other States,\r\nunless duly authorized.\r\nSurrounded by a semi-enclosed sea, the Republic of\r\nKorea strongly upholds the principle of cooperation\r\namong the relevant coastal States under the Convention.\r\nNo living resource or marine environment respects\r\nartificial delimitations. The successful management of\r\nliving resources or a marine environment in a semi-\r\nenclosed sea requires the establishment of a regime for\r\nthe close cooperation of coastal States that takes into\r\naccount the integrity of the sea. In a semi-enclosed sea,\r\nany unilateral measure or agreement in disregard of the\r\ninterests of relevant parties would fail to achieve its\r\nintended goal. Furthermore, it is our strong view that\r\ncoastal States in a semi-enclosed sea should not take any\r\nmeasures or reach any agreements which are likely to\r\ninfringe upon the legitimate interests of other coastal\r\nStates. Upon the request of any interested coastal States,\r\nconsultations should be considered compulsory in such\r\nsituations.\r\nGiven the formidable implications of maritime\r\ndisputes for international relations, the prevention and\r\nearly settlement of such disputes is crucial for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Close\r\nconsultation and cooperation regionally or among the\r\nStates concerned will contribute a great deal to the\r\nprevention of maritime disputes. Meanwhile, the\r\nConvention is considered epoch-making in establishing a\r\nthird-party compulsory dispute-settlement mechanism. We\r\nbelieve that the wider use of this mechanism will help the\r\ninternational community to preserve the order of the\r\nocean. It is also worth noting that States involved in a\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\ndispute should refrain from any activities likely to aggravate\r\nit pending final settlement.\r\nFinally, I wish to reiterate Korea’s firm commitment\r\nto the full implementation of the Convention and the\r\namicable settlement of maritime disputes. The Republic of\r\nKorea has been, and continues to be, ready and willing to\r\ncontribute to the orderly development of the ocean. We\r\nhope that mankind’s continuing voyage into the still-\r\nunknown potential of the ocean will bring prosperity in the\r\nnext millennium, just as the voyage of Columbus opened up\r\nthe New World 500 years ago. It goes without saying that\r\nthe spirit of cooperation is indispensable for the success of\r\nthis uncharted voyage.\r\nMr. Panevkin (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The Russian delegation attaches great\r\nsignificance to the consideration of the agenda item entitled\r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”. The discussion of this\r\nquestion by the General Assembly demonstrates the\r\nimportance the international community attaches to the\r\nproblems related to the oceans and the law of the sea and\r\npermits an annual assessment of the development of\r\ncooperation among States in this sphere. It also allows us\r\nto identify problems requiring attention and to adopt\r\nappropriate measures. In this respect, we also express our\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for\r\npreparing the four reports, which are a good foundation for\r\ntoday’s discussion.\r\nThis past year had substantial significance for the\r\nfurther development of cooperation between States in\r\nmatters relating to oceans and the law of the sea. It was\r\nnoteworthy for the further movement by the international\r\ncommunity towards a coordinated and integrated approach\r\nto solving the problems I have mentioned. There has also\r\nbeen an increase in the number of parties to the 1982\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and a number of other\r\ninternational instruments related to ocean affairs. The\r\nRussian Federation, in particular, ratified the 1982\r\nConvention as well as the Agreement on the Conservation\r\nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that with the election in\r\n1997 of the members of the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf the establishment of the institutions\r\nprovided for by the Convention has now been virtually\r\ncompleted. The International Tribunal for the Law of the\r\nSea took up its first case in November. Thus practically all\r\nthe necessary requirements have been fulfilled for the\r\neffective implementation of the Convention, for its uniform\r\nand consistent application, and also for fuller cooperation\r\nby States in the area of the law of the sea.\r\nThe Russian delegation considers that the\r\nestablishment of a single legal regime for the oceans\r\ngenuinely promotes the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and facilitates the development of\r\ninternational cooperation in the peaceful use of seas and\r\noceans. For this reason, Russia has consistently advocated\r\nan enhanced role for the Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea as an important universal international legal\r\ninstrument in the domain of maritime activities and\r\nsupports the appeals to States not yet parties to the\r\nConvention to accede to it as quickly as possible. This\r\napplies equally to the Agreement on the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, which represents a code of\r\ngenerally accepted standards of behaviour by States and\r\ndefines the parameters for bilateral relations and for\r\nregional cooperation in the area of fisheries.\r\nAt the same time, we wish to express our concern\r\nthat some countries are trying to subordinate the\r\ninterpretation and application of the Convention to the\r\nprovisions of national law or to interpret some of its\r\nprovisions unilaterally, including those related to the right\r\nof innocent passage through the territorial sea, transit\r\npassage through straits used for international navigation,\r\narchipelagic sea lanes passage and freedom of navigation\r\nand other internationally recognized uses of the seas, in\r\nthe exclusive economic zone, as rightly pointed out in\r\nparagraph 15 of the Secretary-General’s Report\r\n[A/52/487]. Nor can we agree with unilateral attempts to\r\nchange or give individual interpretations to some of the\r\nprovisions of other international legal documents on the\r\nlaw of the sea, notably the 1936 Montreux Convention\r\nregarding the Regime of the Straits. As we see it, such\r\nactions are permissible in terms of international law now\r\nin force only with the manifestly expressed consent of all\r\nthe other States parties to specific international\r\nagreements, including the agreement regarding the regime\r\nof the Black Sea straits.\r\nThe problems of oceans are tightly interlinked and\r\nshould be considered as a single whole. Here the 1982\r\nConvention has a strategic significance as a basis for\r\nnational, regional and global actions in the maritime\r\nsector. Unfortunately, we are obliged to note that some\r\ninternational mechanisms on the law of the sea settle\r\nproblems related to the law of the sea outside the system\r\nof the 1982 Convention — a practice that is prejudicial to\r\na single legal regime for the oceans. We believe that this\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nissue deserves close attention, and we support efforts to\r\nenhance coordination of the action of international\r\nmechanisms on the law of the sea under United Nations\r\nauspices.\r\nRussia, as a major sea Power, attaches great\r\nimportance to activities on the open ocean and intends to\r\ncontinue to participate actively in efforts to improve the\r\npeaceful and mutually profitable cooperation of States in\r\nmastering and exploiting the high seas and to further\r\nstrengthen the international legal regime established by the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nMr. Edwards (Marshall Islands): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation wishes to associate itself with the statement\r\nmade this morning by the representative of the Solomon\r\nIslands on behalf of the South Pacific Forum island\r\ncountries.\r\nThe item under discussion is of great importance to all\r\nsmall island developing States, in particular to the Pacific\r\nisland countries. This has been shown, in part, by our\r\nreadiness to become co-sponsors of the draft resolutions\r\nwhich are before the General Assembly today.\r\nThe resources of the seas represent the most tangible\r\nassets for future development and prosperity that we have.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands has, especially within\r\nthe past year, taken a very proactive approach towards the\r\nsustainable development of our fisheries. At a time when\r\nreform policies for the public sector and the structural\r\nadjustment that they entail are taking effect in the Marshall\r\nIslands, our fisheries sector is also undergoing significant\r\nchanges. While these changes have not been easy, the\r\nresults will no doubt foster sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment, while conserving and managing our most\r\nprecious renewable resource.\r\nNew fisheries policies and legislation have been\r\nintroduced and accepted by our Parliament. They\r\ndemonstrate our firm commitment to sound management\r\nand conservation of our fisheries. For example, the new\r\nMarshall Islands Fisheries Act incorporates approaches\r\ntaken at the international level, particularly in regard to the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and\r\nsubsequently the Agreement relating to straddling fish\r\nstocks and highly migratory fish stocks. In addition, the Act\r\nhas fully taken on board many of the provisions stipulated\r\nin the Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe Marshall Islands is an active participant in the\r\nongoing, multilateral, high-level consultation process in the\r\nPacific. We were concerned about the need to have\r\nworking arrangements for the region while we were\r\ndealing with the practical considerations related to\r\nratification of the Agreement. I might add that the recent\r\nlegislation has taken us a good step forward. As can be\r\nnoted from the Secretary-General’s report, in May this\r\nyear the Marshall Islands hosted the second Conference\r\nin these high-level consultations in our region. A full\r\nreport [A/S-19/28] was presented at the nineteenth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly in June this year, and\r\nthe main findings have been underscored in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report contained in document A/52/555. We\r\nfeel that this is an initiative going beyond a simple\r\ncommitment on our part; the process has initiated steps\r\ntowards the establishment of a multilateral management\r\narrangement for the Pacific region, which will include the\r\nhigh seas.\r\nThe Marshall Islands is also nearing completion of\r\nour in-zone Fisheries Management Plan. This Plan,\r\ncombined with our recently completed Fisheries Act and\r\nthe National Fisheries Development Plan, further\r\ndemonstrates our commitment to meaningfully implement\r\nthe provisions of the Law of the Sea, specifically articles\r\n61 and 62, in this context. In addition, these arrangements\r\nwill be fully compatible with the provisions of the\r\nAgreement as a whole, and will further assist us in the\r\nratification process.\r\nThe Marshall Islands is an active member of our\r\nregional organization, the South Pacific Forum Fisheries\r\nAgency. At its regular meetings at the committee level\r\nthe Marshall Islands will continue to emphasize the need\r\nfor financial support from the international community, if\r\nwe are to succeed in furthering the process that has been\r\ninitiated in our region through multilateral high-level\r\nconsultations.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to echo that\r\nsentiment here in the General Assembly. Sustainable\r\ndevelopment, conservation and management in the\r\ndeveloping countries and in our regions requires a\r\nconcerted effort by the international community. We are\r\ngrateful for the support that has been given; the names of\r\nour benefactors are contained in the report to the special\r\nsession that I referred to earlier. But it is clear to all of us\r\nthat we have not yet completed the process. There is\r\nmuch work to be done. For example, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report in document A/52/557 stresses that the\r\nlevel of illegal fishing activities in the Pacific would\r\ndecrease with the implementation of a vessel monitoring\r\nsystem on distant-water nations’ fishing vessels. This was\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\ndiscussed at length here in New York in the Agreement\r\nnegotiations, and we have several indications to confirm\r\nthis assertion. It is for this reason that our regional\r\nconsultations have taken this point very seriously and\r\nincluded it as a major item to be concluded.\r\nIt is in this regard that my delegation wishes to stress\r\nthe importance of financial and technical support from the\r\ninternational community. We strongly support the inclusion\r\nof this idea in the draft resolutions before us, and urge the\r\nGeneral Assembly to accept these important\r\nrecommendations. The role of the non-governmental\r\norganizations is also important, and they should continue to\r\nbe invited to submit views on draft resolutions in the future.\r\nI would like to conclude by stressing the provision of\r\narticle 64 of the Law of the Sea Convention that\r\ncooperation between coastal States and States that fish in\r\nthe region is compulsory. This cooperation includes\r\nensuring that appropriate meetings, with full participation\r\nof all parties occurs in a timely manner, and that there is\r\nsufficient funding for such meetings. The Marshall Islands\r\nis fully in compliance with this cooperative spirit, and we\r\nwould urge those with an interest in our fisheries to be\r\nequally forthcoming in their support.\r\nMr. Ayewah (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation is\r\npleased to participate in the debate on the agenda item\r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”. At the outset let me\r\nexpress appreciation to the representative of New Zealand\r\nfor her introduction of the draft resolutions on the item and\r\nfor the hard work she has put into their preparation.\r\nSince the entry into force of the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, considerable progress has been made\r\ntowards its implementation, and the number of parties to\r\nthe Convention has also grown. Structurally, all the\r\ninstitutions created under the Convention — the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, the Tribunal for the Law of\r\nthe Sea, and the Commission on the Limits of the\r\nContinental Shelf — have become functional.\r\nWe note in particular that the International Seabed\r\nAuthority has progressed this year from an organizational\r\nphase to a functional one, with the approval of work plans\r\nfor exploration of seven pioneer investors by its Council,\r\nwhich requested the Authority’s Secretary-General to issue\r\nthem with contracts effective for 15 years under the\r\nprovisions of the Convention’s relevant implementation\r\nAgreement. Work on the deep seabed mining code is also\r\nat an advanced stage, while the draft regulation on\r\nprospecting and exploration of polymetallic nodules in the\r\n“Area”, which includes draft standard terms of the\r\nexploration contract, is under consideration by the Legal\r\nand Technical Commission.\r\nFollowing the signing of an agreement with the\r\nUnited Nations, 1998 will mark the beginning of\r\nindependent work by the Authority, when its budget will\r\nbecome the sole responsibility of its members.\r\nConsequently, the Assembly of the Authority adopted a\r\nscale of assessment of contributions of members and its\r\nbudget, including a Working Capital Fund, during its\r\nresumed session in August this year. In this connection,\r\nit is the belief of my delegation that only the resolute\r\ndischarge of obligations under the Convention through the\r\ntimely payment of assessed contributions by member\r\nStates would ensure an assured resource base for the\r\nAuthority to continue to carry out its activities.\r\nOn the other hand, the International Tribunal\r\nestablished in 1996 has already held four sessions and\r\napproved its own budget. The last of the institutions, the\r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, has\r\nalso adopted its modus operandi. In this connection, my\r\ndelegation notes with interest the Commission’s request\r\nfor the establishment of a trust fund for travel expenses\r\nand accommodation for developing member States, and\r\nwould urge States parties to approve it. We have noted\r\nalso that, in line with the streamlining of the United\r\nNations system, the Meeting of States parties has been\r\nreduced to one annual session. In our view, this is cost-\r\neffective and a judicious use of man-hours.\r\nThe strategic importance of the Convention as a\r\nframework for national legal and global action in the\r\nmarine sector is underscored. However, only a faithful\r\nimplementation of its provisions can yield the desired\r\nresults. We agree with the necessity and importance of\r\npromoting international cooperation on the law of the sea\r\nand ocean affairs at the global, regional and subregional\r\nlevels.\r\nIn its resolution 49/28, the Assembly called for an\r\nannual review of developments relating to the law of the\r\nsea. That resolution conferred on the United Nations\r\nresponsibility for, among other things, monitoring State\r\npractices and the provision of information, advice and\r\nassistance in the fields of interest and concern to States\r\nand international organizations. Consequently, cooperation\r\non important new issues in the field of the law of the sea\r\nand ocean affairs would require the establishment of\r\nnational integrated marine policies by Governments. In\r\nthis connection, we appreciate the provision of assistance\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nto developing countries as well as training under the\r\nHamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial Fellowship.\r\nWhile 1998 has been designated the “Year of the\r\nOcean”, we hasten to add that this can be meaningful only\r\nif all Governments agree to ratify or accede to the\r\nConvention and its relevant instruments and endeavour to\r\nimplement them as soon as possible.\r\nAn annual review of developments relating to the law\r\nof the sea has indicated, through a United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) report, that there has\r\nbeen a deterioration of the global environment. More\r\nworrisome even is the report that a third of the world’s\r\ncoastal regions are at high risk of degradation, particularly\r\nfrom land-based activities such as rapid, unplanned\r\nurbanization, thus placing a major stress upon adjacent\r\necosystems. This must be prevented, as this unsustainable\r\nmanner of economic development can in future lead to food\r\ninsecurity and conflict situations. It will be recalled that\r\nAgenda 21, from the Rio Summit, had underscored that\r\nsocio-economic development and environmental protection\r\nare interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, in its turn, has\r\ndeveloped a balance between the use of the oceans and its\r\nresources and the protection of the environment in a\r\nmanner that will ensure the equitable and efficient use of\r\nresources. In addition, it has developed a number of\r\ninternational legal instruments which directly or indirectly\r\ncontribute to the protection of the marine and coastal\r\nenvironment.\r\nIn resolution 51/36, the General Assembly took note\r\nof the report of the Secretary-General stating that large-\r\nscale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in zones\r\nof national jurisdiction and fisheries by-catch and discard\r\nare having negative impacts on the living marine resources\r\nof the world’s oceans and seas and their sustainable use.\r\nWe cannot but agree with his deep concern at the\r\ncontinuing reports of activities inconsistent with the terms\r\nof resolutions 46/215 and 49/116.\r\nAs a developing country and a developing coastal\r\nState, Nigeria is concerned that such detrimental practices\r\nstill persist. Even reports of the progress made by members\r\nof the international community, international organizations\r\nand regional economic integration organizations towards the\r\nimplementation of relevant resolutions, as indicated in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, do not pacify us. Equally\r\nalarming are reports by the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) regarding over-\r\nfishing by large fleet shipping vessels. Unfortunately,\r\ndeveloping countries lack the capacity to monitor or\r\ncontrol these fishing activities or enforce the pertinent\r\nregulations.\r\nWe are happy to note the provision for development\r\nassistance to developing States by the General Assembly\r\nfor this purpose. We must also underscore the need for\r\nthose concerned to respect applicable international\r\ninstruments, including, among others, the Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the Agreement for the\r\nimplementation of its provisions relating to the\r\nconservation and management of straddling fish stocks\r\nand highly migratory fish stocks. It is in this spirit that\r\nwe also welcome the FAO’s efforts and intent to organize\r\nin 1998 a Technical Consultation on Management of\r\nFishing Capacity, which will draft guidelines for the\r\ncontrol and management of fishing.\r\nI cannot conclude this brief statement without\r\ndrawing attention to the equally deplorable activities of\r\nsome industrialized States, which dump toxic and\r\nhazardous wastes, especially in the waters of developing\r\nStates, or carry out other forms of pollution through the\r\ndeliberate discharge of pollutants such as oil and oily\r\nwastes, noxious liquids or solids, and sewage or garbage.\r\nIn the interest of the marine environment and the\r\npreservation of the ecosystem, we call on such States to\r\ndesist from those acts.\r\nMr. Gramajo (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Argentine Republic considers that the\r\nprocess begun in 1973 with the convening of the Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is now\r\napproaching fruition. This is because of the nearly\r\nuniversal application of the United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea and because the network of\r\ninstitutions and organs provided for in the Convention\r\nhave now been established. The hopes expressed in 1973\r\nat the outset of the Third United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Law of the Sea are now being realized. The nearly\r\nuniversal acceptance of the Convention and the\r\nfunctioning of its institutions clearly prove that law is\r\nplaying an increasingly important role in international\r\naffairs.\r\nGiven the length of its coastline and its southerly\r\nlocation, Argentina must inevitably give considerable\r\nattention to maritime affairs. With a coastline of 4,500\r\nkilometres and with 1.3 million square kilometres of\r\nterritorial seas, home to some of the world’s most\r\nsubstantial marine living resources, Argentina is\r\nparticularly active in this area. Here I would recall such\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nfactors as the major squid fisheries off the southern Buenos\r\nAires region and Patagonia as an indication of how vital\r\nocean affairs are for Argentina.\r\nFor Argentina, the importance of the sea and of the\r\nlaws and institutions that govern it is heightened by the role\r\nof maritime routes in its international trade. For example,\r\nvital exports pass to other continents through ports of the\r\nParaná and Plata rivers, notably Buenos Aires and La Plata.\r\nOur rivers and seas are not merely a source of resources,\r\nbut are major trade routes for Argentina.\r\nThe importance of the sea for Argentina is heightened\r\neven further by another geographical reality: the Plata river\r\nand the other main navigable rivers in its basin. Through\r\nthe Paraná-Paraguay canal, which flows into the Plata, the\r\nPlata basin extends into the Atlantic Ocean, which\r\nfacilitates trade by the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR) with other continents. Argentina therefore\r\nhas a keen interest in river matters — an interest it shares\r\nwith Uruguay — as well as maritime interests geared\r\ntowards trade and cooperation in the framework of a strict\r\npolicy of environmental conservation and protection.\r\nAs a coastal State with particular interest in the\r\ndevelopment of the law of the sea and ocean affairs,\r\nArgentina stresses the importance of conserving the marine\r\nenvironment and of adopting the necessary measures to that\r\nend, in conformity with international law. Similarly,\r\nArgentina pursues a policy of conservation of living marine\r\nresources, and has adopted domestic laws to prevent\r\noverexploitation in maritime areas under its sovereignty or\r\njurisdiction. Moreover, Argentina has signed the Agreement\r\nfor the Implementation of the Provisions of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea of\r\n10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and\r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, and hopes soon to become a party\r\nto this. The purpose of that Agreement is precisely to avoid\r\noverexploitation.\r\nI wish to conclude by noting that, in the light of what\r\nI have said, the sea is a most important political and\r\neconomic element of the process of world-wide\r\ninterdependence. The Argentine Republic therefore\r\nconsiders that the legal order regulating the sea has a\r\nfundamental role to play in the context of international law.\r\nFor Argentina, these political and economic developments\r\nhave given the law of the sea renewed and growing\r\nimportance compared with the situation in 1973, when the\r\nThird United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea\r\nwas getting under way. As an Atlantic State with a special\r\ninterest in maritime and ocean affairs, Argentina will\r\ncontinue to participate actively in the process of the\r\ncodification and progressive development of the law of\r\nthe sea and will contribute to its consolidation.\r\nMr. Benítez Sáenz (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The item entitled “Oceans and the law of the\r\nsea” has special meaning for my delegation, not only\r\nbecause our economy and our geographical location make\r\nit relevant to us, but also because we firmly believe that\r\nit is a sphere of activity in which international law and\r\ncooperation among States should continue to play a\r\nparticularly important role.\r\nAmong the most notable activities of the United\r\nNations was the initiative to convene the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which\r\nsuccessfully culminated in the adoption of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea — the\r\nMontego Bay Convention. The organs established under\r\nthat Convention have begun functioning, and, following\r\nthe 1996 election of its members, the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea held its first sessions in\r\n1997. Uruguay attaches particular importance to the\r\nestablishment of the Tribunal, as it was among the States\r\nthat when it signed the Convention opted to submit\r\ndisputes relating to the interpretation or application of the\r\nConvention to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, as stipulated in\r\narticle 287 of the Convention.\r\nThis year also saw the Commission on the Limits of\r\nthe Continental Shelf begin its work. We welcome the\r\nelection of its members and are certain that their technical\r\nskill and impartiality will ensure that States, such as my\r\nown, with continental shelves extending beyond 200\r\nnautical miles will be able to delimit them through the\r\nexercise of the rights set out in the Convention.\r\nProbably the most important event of this period was\r\nthe approval by the International Seabed Authority of the\r\nplans of work for exploration of seven registered pioneer\r\ninvestors. The long-held dream of exploration of the\r\nseabed as the common heritage of mankind is now\r\nbeginning to come true. With the impetus and dynamism\r\nprovided by the Secretary-General of the Authority,\r\nAmbassador Satya Nandan of Fiji, progress has begun on\r\nthis and other tasks entrusted to the Authority. We hope\r\nthat we shall now move on to concrete achievements in\r\nthis area.\r\nWe share the view that the various issues relating to\r\nthe maritime space are very closely interrelated and\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nshould be considered together, especially by the organs\r\ncreated under the Montego Bay Convention. For that\r\nreason, we reiterate our grave concern at the increasingly\r\nfrequent transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste\r\nthrough areas of the high seas close to our exclusive\r\neconomic zone. We cannot accept these lethal cargoes\r\nbeing carried so close to our coastline on the pretext of\r\nfreedom of navigation.\r\nThe fishing resources that are under our jurisdiction\r\nand the marine currents that flow freely according to the\r\nlaws of nature do not recognize limits and borders imposed\r\nby man and, in case of an accident, many of our States\r\nwould be seriously harmed through such forms of\r\ntransportation.\r\nUruguay believes it essential to proceed to regulate the\r\nmaritime transport of nuclear material and radioactive\r\nwaste, and we are prepared to contribute in all areas to\r\nensure that this does not continue.\r\nWe are following closely the discussions taking place\r\nin the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and it is our\r\nunderstanding that the obligation to safeguard the marine\r\nenvironment requires prior notification of coastal States that\r\nare situated along the route of radioactive cargo.\r\nThe draft objective of the Joint Oslo and Paris\r\n(OSPAR) Commission with regard to radioactive substances\r\nmarks progress in this area, and we hope that it will be\r\nadopted in 1998 in Lisbon on the occasion of Ocean Expo\r\n98.\r\nAs regards accidents involving the transport of nuclear\r\nmaterial and other types of maritime accidents, there is\r\nneed to develop new criteria and procedures for the\r\npayment of appropriate compensation. Article 235 of the\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea provides for this form of\r\ninternational cooperation among States in order to\r\ndetermine the responsibilities and obligations related to the\r\nassessment of damage and compensation.\r\nWe believe that the progress made by the Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group of Legal and Technical Experts of the\r\nConference of Parties of the Basel Convention on the\r\nControl of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes\r\nand their Disposal should be complemented by work in the\r\ncontext of the relevant provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolutions\r\nA/52/L.26, A/52/L.27, A/52/L.29 and A/52/L.30.\r\nBefore giving the floor to the next speaker in\r\nexplanation of vote before the voting, may I remind\r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nI now call on the representative of Turkey.\r\nMrs. Baykal (Turkey): Among the four draft\r\nresolutions before the General Assembly, Turkey will\r\nvote against the draft resolution entitled “Oceans and the\r\nlaw of the sea” contained in document A/52/L.26.\r\nThe reason for my delegation’s negative vote is that\r\nsome of the elements contained in the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, which have prevented Turkey from\r\napproving the Convention, are still retained in this draft\r\nresolution.\r\nTurkey supports all international efforts to establish\r\na regime of the sea that is based on the principle of\r\nequity and that can be acceptable to all States. However,\r\nthe Convention does not make adequate provisions for\r\nspecial geographical situations and, as a consequence, is\r\nnot able to establish an acceptable balance between\r\nconflicting interests. Furthermore, the Convention makes\r\nno provision for registering reservations on specific\r\nclauses.\r\nAlthough we agree with the Convention in its\r\ngeneral intent, and with most of its provisions, we are\r\nunable to become a party to it owing to these serious\r\nshortcomings. This being the case, we cannot support a\r\ndraft resolution which provides that States should\r\nharmonize their national legislation with the provisions of\r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea and should ensure\r\nthe consistent application of those provisions.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolutions A/52/L.26, A/52/L.27, A/52/L.29 and\r\nA/52/L.30 one by one.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A/52/L.26, entitled\r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”. I should like to announce\r\nthat, since the introduction of this draft resolution, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nNepal, Russian Federation and Singapore.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nArgentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain,\r\nBangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bolivia,\r\nBotswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria,\r\nCameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia,\r\nCosta Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus,\r\nCzech Republic, Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, Estonia,\r\nEthiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia,\r\nGermany, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-\r\nBissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary,\r\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic\r\nRepublic of), Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica,\r\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan,\r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, Latvia,\r\nLebanon, Liberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali,\r\nMalta, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius,\r\nMexico, Micronesia (Federated States of),\r\nMonaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique,\r\nMyanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands,\r\nNew Zealand, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman,\r\nPakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay,\r\nPhilippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of\r\nKorea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian\r\nFederation, Samoa, San Marino, Saudi Arabia,\r\nSenegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia,\r\nSlovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain,\r\nSri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Sweden, Tajikistan,\r\nThailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,\r\nTurkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab\r\nEmirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania,\r\nUnited States of America, Uruguay, Viet Nam,\r\nYemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nTurkey\r\nAbstaining:\r\nEcuador, El Salvador, Peru, Venezuela\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.26 was adopted by 138 votes\r\nto 1, with 4 abstentions (resolution 52/26).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of Eritrea and Ghana\r\ninformed the Secretariat that they had intended to\r\nvote in favour.]\r\nThe Acting President: We turn next to draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.27, entitled “Agreement concerning the\r\nRelationship between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/52/L.27?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.27 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/27).\r\nThe Acting President: We now turn to draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.29, entitled “Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982\r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of\r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\r\nStocks”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/52/L.29?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.29 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/28).\r\nThe Acting President: We now turn to draft\r\nresolution A/52/L.30, entitled “Large-scale pelagic drift-\r\nnet fishing: unauthorized fishing in zones of national\r\njurisdiction and on the high seas; fisheries by-catch and\r\ndiscards; and other developments”.\r\nI should like to announce that since the introduction\r\nof the draft resolution, Singapore has become a sponsor\r\nof draft resolution A/52/L.30.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/52/L.30?\r\nDraft resolution A/52/L.30 was adopted (resolution\r\n52/29).\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nThe Acting President: A number of representatives\r\nhave asked to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May\r\nI remind members that statements in exercise of the right\r\nof reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention\r\nand to five minutes for the second intervention, and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nI call on the representative of China.\r\nMr. Gao Feng (China) (interpretation from Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to exercise its right of reply\r\nbecause this afternoon the representative of Viet Nam, in\r\nhis statement before the General Assembly, referred to the\r\nChinese territory of Xisha and Nansha Islands. The Chinese\r\ndelegation is compelled to express its views on this issue.\r\nFirst, Xisha and Nansha Islands have, since ancient\r\ntimes, been a part of Chinese territory. This is based on\r\nexperience and on our practices in exploring that part of the\r\nSouth China Sea. It has also been made clear in numerous\r\ninternational instruments, and has been confirmed by\r\ninternational practices, including the confirmation of the\r\nGovernment of Viet Nam.\r\nSecondly, the Chinese Government has always\r\nmaintained that a peaceful resolution of the problem should\r\nbe achieved through bilateral negotiations. As I mentioned\r\nduring the general debate, the Chinese Government is in\r\nfavour of resolving the dispute appropriately through\r\nnegotiation in accordance with well-established international\r\nlaw, including the principles established in the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Chinese\r\nGovernment is at present in the process of conducting\r\nconsultations in this respect.\r\nThirdly, China is opposed to the internationalization of\r\nthe question of the Nansha Islands. It also opposes\r\nintervention in the issue by nations outside the region. We\r\nbelieve that the parties to the dispute should abide by\r\ninternational law, the guidelines governing relations\r\nbetween States and the principles for the settlement of\r\ninternational disputes. The issue should not be made more\r\ncomplex.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Pham Truong Giang (Viet Nam): My delegation\r\nwishes to refer to the question of the Eastern Sea, also\r\nknown as the South China Sea. My Ambassador, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Viet Nam, in his address to\r\nthe General Assembly this afternoon, reaffirmed Viet Nam\u0027s\r\nconsistent position regarding the Eastern Sea, and Viet\r\nNam\u0027s sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Paracel and\r\nSpratly Islands. Viet Nam supports the 1992 declaration\r\nby the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), containing principles for the settlement of\r\ndisputes concerning the Eastern Sea, and we urge that\r\nthese principles be upheld. Viet Nam\u0027s view is that the\r\ndispute must be settled through peaceful negotiation in the\r\nspirit of equality, mutual understanding and respect for\r\neach other\u0027s sovereignty and jurisdiction over their\r\nrespective continental shelves and exclusive economic\r\nzones, in accordance with international law, particularly\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe parties concerned should, while making active efforts\r\nto promote negotiations for a fundamental and long-term\r\nsolution, maintain stability on the basis of the status quo,\r\nand refrain from any act that may further complicate the\r\nsituation and from the use or threat of force.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Sorreta (Philippines): I wish to speak on the\r\nissue of conflicting claims in the South China Sea, which\r\nwas raised both during the general debate and just now in\r\nstatements made in right of reply. The Philippines is also\r\na claimant, and still maintains its claims to areas of the\r\nSouth China Sea. Having said that, however, we believe\r\nin, and have been working towards, a just, peaceful and\r\nlasting solution to the conflicting claims. I might add that\r\nour desire to settle these disputes peacefully is driven not\r\nonly by the fact that we fully realize that the peace and\r\nstability of our region has been the fundamental basis for\r\nour sustained growth, which is of record proportions, but\r\nbecause we are very much aware of the potential for\r\nconflict in the region. We are talking about potential\r\nstrategic resources and strategic sea lanes in a region of\r\ngreat diversity — a region of very diverse history,\r\nlanguage, culture, religion and colonial experience, all of\r\nwhich, together, could be quite a heady mixture for\r\nconflict. Perhaps in any other region in the world it would\r\nhave resulted in conflict.\r\nThere is no outward and manifest conflict over these\r\nclaims. We are working. All the claimants, except one,\r\nare members of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) and the one that is not a member of\r\nASEAN is a very close partner of ASEAN in regional\r\ndialogue. I believe that we will eventually not have to\r\ndiscuss matters like this in this forum, because we will\r\neventually find a solution to these problems.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 57th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 26 November 1997\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Marzuki (Malaysia): My delegation wishes to\r\nrefer to the issue of the South China Sea. I would like to\r\nplace on record that Malaysia is also a claimant to parts\r\nof the Spratley Islands located within our continental\r\nshelf. In this respect, we are committed to resolving the\r\nquestion of overlapping claims through negotiation and\r\npeaceful means, as set out in the Manila Declaration on\r\nthe South China Sea adopted by the Foreign Ministers of\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in\r\nManila in June 1992.\r\nThe Acting President: We have concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 39.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.\r\n22\r\n"
