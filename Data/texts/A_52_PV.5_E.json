(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 10\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization\r\nThe President: This morning, the General Assembly,\r\nin accordance with the decision taken at its 4th plenary\r\nmeeting on 19 September 1997, will first take up agenda\r\nitem 10, entitled “Report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nwork of the Organization”, to hear a brief presentation by\r\nthe Secretary-General of his annual report.\r\nI give the floor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Congratulations,\r\nMr. President, on your election to this important post, made\r\nall the more so by the weighty deliberations through which\r\nyou will be guiding this Assembly.\r\nI am grateful for the opportunity to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly just before the general debate begins.\r\nThis is the first time in the 52-year history of the\r\nOrganization that the Secretary-General has been so\r\nhonoured.\r\nMy presence here today reflects the importance that\r\nyou attach to the proposals for United Nations reform I\r\npresented to Member States on 16 July 1997. Indeed, let\r\nthis be the Reform General Assembly. Let it be\r\nremembered as a time when all of us joined forces and\r\nseized the opportunities created by the new era to\r\nrevitalize our United Nations — this unique and universal\r\ninstrument for concerted action in pursuit of the\r\nbetterment of humankind.\r\nBefore I turn to the issue of reform, permit me to\r\nsay a few words about the ongoing work and challenges\r\nof the Organization and to raise several matters of serious\r\ninternational concern that require urgent attention.\r\nIn my recently released annual report, I described\r\nmyself as prudently optimistic about the overall state of\r\nthe United Nations today.\r\nThe past year’s progress includes the adoption of the\r\nAgenda for Development, expressing a new consensus to\r\nguide our activities in this critically important field. It\r\nincludes major achievements in disarmament, particularly\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention, and the Ottawa process\r\nto ban anti-personnel landmines, which I have vigorously\r\nsupported.\r\nIn the area of peacekeeping, significant movement is\r\ntaking place among a group of countries towards forming\r\na standby high-readiness brigade within the framework of\r\nUnited Nations standby agreements. Such a brigade would\r\nenable the Organization to act in crises before they\r\nunravel into escalating spirals of violence.\r\nResponding to ever more frequent requests from\r\nMember States, we have expanded our programmes in\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nsupport of good governance, democratization and\r\nstrengthening national capacity to promote human rights.\r\nMy annual report also acknowledges disappointments.\r\nThe benefits of economic globalization remain too\r\nconcentrated to benefit the vast majority of developing\r\ncountries, even as official development assistance continues\r\nto decline.\r\nNew paradigms of cooperation are needed in which\r\nmajor increases in assistance are combined with selective\r\ndebt relief, access to markets and investment strategies. All\r\nsocieties, including those currently marginalized by the\r\nforces of globalization, must have the opportunity to\r\nbecome active participants in the new international\r\neconomy.\r\nThe achievements of disarmament do not yet\r\nencompass the remaining nuclear stockpiles, nor have they\r\ncontained the proliferation of light weapons and small arms,\r\nincluding in conflicts that the United Nations is mandated\r\nto resolve. The department for disarmament and arms\r\nregulation that I have proposed is intended to bolster the\r\ncapacity of the Organization to pursue such aims.\r\nWhat is more, in a growing number of conflicts,\r\ncivilian populations have become the explicit targets of\r\nfactional combatants and humanitarian missions have been\r\nimpeded, denied access and subjected to attacks.\r\nViolence against women has become the most\r\npervasive human rights violation, respecting no distinction\r\nof geography, culture or wealth.\r\nWe will have to erase these ugly stains from the\r\ncanvas of contemporary life.\r\nThe nineteenth special session of the General\r\nAssembly — Rio +5 — made it clear that little progress\r\nhas been made in achieving or implementing the\r\nagreements reached at the 1992 United Nations Conference\r\non Environment and Development. We must do better at\r\nKyoto in December and secure legally binding\r\ncommitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which\r\nwe know to cause global warming.\r\nI also draw your attention to several areas of ongoing\r\nconcern that you may wish to address during this debate.\r\nSince assuming office in January, I have taken\r\ninitiatives to begin or revive peace processes in several\r\nconflict situations, some of which have long defied\r\nresolution. To that end, I have appointed special\r\nrepresentatives for Western Sahara, Cyprus, East Timor,\r\nthe Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Somalia and\r\nAfghanistan. A breakthrough may be at hand in Western\r\nSahara and signs of hope glimmer elsewhere.\r\nIn Afghanistan, however, despite our best efforts, the\r\nparties continue to wage a brutal and futile civil war, with\r\nheavy civilian casualties. A renewed commitment on the\r\npart of regional and international actors is required to\r\nprevent further bloodshed and a humanitarian crisis of\r\ndreadful proportions.\r\nIn the Great Lakes region, despite the combined\r\nefforts of the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, bitter legacies persist, as do intolerance\r\nand violence. I urge the countries of the region to pursue\r\nthe path of peace, democracy, reconciliation and\r\nreconstruction — with full respect for human rights —\r\nand to work with the international community to assist\r\nand sustain their efforts.\r\nIn Bosnia, the international community must be\r\nprepared to consolidate the gains achieved and to prevent\r\na relapse into the horrors that triggered its involvement.\r\nWe must ensure that our collective investments —\r\nmilitary, political and financial — have not been in vain.\r\nDoing so will require patience and persistence by all\r\nconcerned.\r\nFinally, the international community cannot but view\r\nwith grave concern the mounting threats to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian peace process. We call on all sides to take the\r\ncourageous decisions required to re-establish mutual\r\nconfidence and rededicate themselves to achieving a\r\nlasting peace.\r\nI now turn to the item on your agenda that surely is\r\nthe most significant for the future role of our\r\nOrganization: the challenge of reform.\r\nI presented detailed proposals to you in this Hall\r\nmore than two months ago, on 16 July 1997. It is my\r\nhope that when this session ends more than two months\r\nfrom now, we will have reached consensus and can begin\r\nthe process of implementation. Permit me to recapitulate\r\nthe main objectives and key features.\r\nWhat are the objectives of the reforms? We aspire to\r\na United Nations that can act with greater unity of\r\npurpose, coherence of efforts and responsiveness in\r\npursuit of peace and progress; a United Nations that can\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nfocus on its priorities; a United Nations that empowers both\r\nGovernments and people to realize goals through\r\ncollaboration that might otherwise elude them; a United\r\nNations that will express the highest moral aspirations of\r\nhumankind even as it delivers practical benefits to men,\r\nwomen and children in cities and villages around the world.\r\nWe aspire to a United Nations that recognizes and\r\njoins in partnership with an ever more robust global civil\r\nsociety, while helping to eliminate uncivil elements like\r\ndrug traffickers, criminals and terrorists; a United Nations\r\nthat will view change as a friend — not change for its own\r\nsake, but change that permits us to do more by doing what\r\nwe do better.\r\nFor whom do we seek these objectives? We seek them\r\nfor those who most need a renewed and revitalized United\r\nNations because they lack the power and wealth to shape\r\nthe international environment to their advantage. We seek\r\nthem for the global public interest. We seek them in the\r\ninterest of the future of the Organization itself.\r\nAnd how do we propose to meet these objectives? By\r\nrationalizing and streamlining our operations at\r\nHeadquarters and in the field. By creating new management\r\nstructures that will permit us to act as one within and\r\nacross our diverse areas of activities. By encouraging a new\r\ninstitutional culture that stresses excellence in promoting the\r\ncollective good. By enhancing the accountability that\r\nMember States deserve and creating the flexibility that the\r\nSecretariat needs.\r\nAnd we intend to meet these objectives by promoting\r\nat all times the particular needs of the most disadvantaged\r\nsocieties among us through the creation of the United\r\nNations development group, a new office of development\r\nfinancing, a new system of multi-year pledges for\r\ndevelopment cooperation and a development dividend\r\nfunded from administrative savings, as well as by\r\nstrengthening the role of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nespecially in the area of macroeconomic dialogue.\r\nMomentum has been building since I announced the\r\nreform package on 16 July. Press reports from around the\r\nworld have been encouraging. Individual Governments as\r\nwell as groups of Governments have expressed support.\r\nCivil society organizations and the private sector are\r\napproaching us with ever greater frequency to work with us\r\nand to lend their assistance.\r\nThe extraordinarily generous and historically\r\nunprecedented $1 billion gift from Mr. Ted Turner for the\r\nUnited Nations work in the development, environment\r\nand humanitarian fields is the most visible expression of\r\nthis new and promising relationship.\r\nLastly, I fully expect to have implemented those\r\nreform measures that are within my own jurisdiction\r\nbefore the end of this calendar year.\r\nNow I ask you, the Member States, to act. Some of\r\nyou I ask to do what your legal obligations require: to\r\nliquidate your arrears and to pay your future assessments\r\nin full, on time and without conditions.\r\nAll of you I ask to move expeditiously to consider\r\nthe package of reforms that is before you, with the aim of\r\nreaching political consensus and providing budgetary\r\nauthority before this session ends. We live in a new day,\r\nand it requires a new way. Therefore, let this be the\r\nReform Assembly. This is the moment to re-imagine the\r\nrole of the United Nations, giving it new life for the new\r\ncentury.\r\nWhen I launched my reform plan, I pledged to\r\nnarrow the gap between aspiration and achievement at the\r\nUnited Nations. I say to you today that we must move to\r\nclose another gap — the one between the rhetoric and the\r\nreality of the common world. To close that gap we need\r\nthe most effective instrument possible for collective\r\ndeliberation and concerted action. The United Nations can\r\nbe that instrument, just as the Charter envisioned it,\r\nprovided that we act and we act now. This is our chance.\r\nWe must not let it pass.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nvery important statement.\r\nWe have concluded this stage of our consideration\r\nof agenda item 10.\r\nAgenda item 9\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the first\r\nspeaker in the general debate, I should like to remind\r\nmembers of the decision taken by the General Assembly\r\nat its 4th plenary meeting, on 19 September, that\r\ncongratulations should not be expressed inside the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall after a speech has been delivered.\r\nIn this connection, may I also remind members of\r\nanother decision, taken by the Assembly at the same\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nmeeting, that speakers in the general debate, after delivering\r\ntheir statements, would leave the Assembly Hall through\r\nroom GA-200, located behind the podium, before returning\r\nto their seats.\r\nI should also like to remind representatives that, in\r\naccordance with the decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly at its 4th plenary meeting, the list of speakers\r\nwill be closed on Wednesday, 24 September, at 6 p.m. May\r\nI request delegations to be good enough to provide\r\nestimated speaking times that are as accurate as possible.\r\nThis will facilitate the work of the Secretariat.\r\nI now give the floor to the first speaker in the general\r\ndebate, the Minister of External Relations of Brazil,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Luiz Felipe Lampreia.\r\nMr. Lampreia (Brazil): On behalf of the Brazilian\r\ndelegation, I would like to congratulate you, my dear\r\ncolleague, Hennadiy Udovenko, the Foreign Minister of\r\nUkraine, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-second session. Brazil has a significant\r\nand active community of Ukrainian origin. We Brazilians\r\nare thus very glad to see this session headed by a\r\ndistinguished son of the Ukraine, a country that is close to\r\nus.\r\nI want to express my recognition to the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Malaysia, Ambassador Razali Ismail, for\r\nthe way he conducted the work of the fifty-first session.\r\nAmbassador Razali’s dynamic presidency paved the way,\r\nthrough extensive consultation, for an imaginative and\r\ncomprehensive proposal to advance Security Council\r\nreform.\r\nI also pay tribute to our new Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, chosen to oversee the political and\r\nadministrative challenges of modernization. He has been the\r\nfocus of justifiable expectation on the part of the\r\ninternational community at a difficult moment in the life of\r\nour Organization.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s proposals for\r\nreform and institutional strengthening as a sign of renewed\r\nvitality within the United Nations. These proposals and\r\nAmbassador Razali’s contribution will certainly warrant\r\nclose attention in the General Assembly and in parallel\r\nconsultation. We will help to consolidate a new spirit that\r\nshould inspire our Organization. This new spirit is called\r\nleadership — that driving force of history altering the\r\ncourse of events within countries and in the international\r\nscenario, opening new horizons, giving hope to the peoples\r\nof the world, seeing movement where some can only\r\nstand still.\r\nAmbassador Razali and Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan have, in a way, revived the leadership of the\r\ncreators of the United Nations. They have shown the\r\nsame idealism in establishing goals and pragmatism in\r\ncarrying them out. It was also the leadership of men such\r\nas Dag Hammarskjöld and Brazilian statesman Oswaldo\r\nAranha, twice President of this Assembly, that often led\r\nthe United Nations to a decisive role as a factor of change\r\nin international relations.\r\nThis kind of leadership has given the world a forum\r\nwithout parallel in history, a stage for negotiation and a\r\npolitical force in favour of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Although the United Nations has not always\r\nbeen able to prevent or to deter conflict, it has certainly\r\nreduced its occurrence and avoided some of its more\r\nserious consequences. For this reason, the United Nations\r\nhas been a mandatory reference, a sign of hope and a\r\nmoral force for world public opinion.\r\nWe are witnessing today the rebirth of this\r\nleadership, feeling its effects through a remarkable change\r\nin the heart and soul of our Organization. There is greater\r\noptimism. There is greater motivation among delegates\r\nand staff. There is greater expectation on the part of many\r\nGovernments. A new atmosphere of hope embraces the\r\nUnited Nations. This is something we must nurture and\r\npromote — something we must filter to the public in\r\norder to renew the trust of the international community in\r\nour Organization.\r\nThe agenda of the fifty-second session is vast and\r\nreveals the continuing complexity and the numerous\r\nconflicts of interests that animate international relations in\r\nour times. A new international dynamic combines three\r\npositive impulses: first, modernization and political and\r\neconomic opening in most countries; secondly, economic\r\nintegration in regional contexts, with multiple political\r\nand security benefits; and thirdly, the internationalization\r\nof the economy on a global scale.\r\nThese impulses tend to generate, foster and\r\nconsolidate international peace and security. They are\r\nbased on confidence and understanding and should allow\r\nus to prosper and achieve the desired material and\r\nspiritual results. Economic integration is increasingly the\r\ngreat bulwark of international peace and cooperation. It\r\nmust be given emphasis and further promoted.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nPrecisely because of its many political and economic\r\nbenefits, integration is a defining trait of South America’s\r\nreality, a direct consequence of democracy and economic\r\nfreedom. The Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR), a new and powerful impetus for\r\ndevelopment in the region, is an example of the importance\r\nof integration. With democracy firmly rooted and a\r\ndynamic process of integration, South America has a\r\nreduced potential for conflict. It has the lowest rates of\r\nmilitary spending in the world and is following an\r\neconomic course based on strict government budget\r\ncontrols. Our priorities are stability and development. Arms\r\npurchases are compatible with the defense needs of Latin\r\nAmerican countries. They are aimed at replacing obsolete\r\nor exhausted equipment. Recently announced measures in\r\nthe strategic-military domain will not affect these\r\nfundamental parameters.\r\nThe concrete interests that bring together the countries\r\nof South America — trade, investment and the\r\nreinforcement of our international standing through\r\nMERCOSUR — are an unyielding factor of unity and\r\ncohesion. There is no threat of military destabilization in\r\nLatin America. There is no danger of an arms race in the\r\nabsence of political, economic and strategic conditions for\r\nsuch. A regional initiative towards self-imposed limitations\r\non conventional arms purchases is therefore unjustified. It\r\nwould be tantamount to disarming those already disarmed.\r\nOur preoccupation, on the other hand, should be the\r\nfight against the arms trade that sustains organized crime\r\nand drug trafficking. This is the real and grave problem\r\nperpetuating a major source of instability that has,\r\nunfortunately, also affected our region severely. Only\r\ndetermined and coordinated action on the part of the\r\ninternational community, especially through tighter controls\r\non the production and selling of weapons in private hands,\r\ncan curb or even suppress this trade; which feeds crime\r\ncartels and leads to violence, fear and desperation. Brazil\r\nstrongly urges all countries, and particularly those in the\r\nWestern Hemisphere, to intensify cooperation in the fight\r\nagainst arms trafficking.\r\nWe have taken great strides in areas of concern and\r\ngrowing visibility. Disarmament and, most specifically,\r\nefforts towards the elimination of anti-personnel landmines\r\nhave increasingly held the attention of the international\r\ncommunity. Today, we can speak of significant\r\naccomplishments, such as the signing of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the willingness of an\r\noverwhelming majority to make firm commitments,\r\nexpressed at the Oslo Conference on anti-personnel\r\nlandmines.\r\nIn these two instances, Brazil has sought to add its\r\nown efforts to those of the international community. This\r\nwas the main thrust of President Fernando Henrique\r\nCardoso’s decision to submit the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to congressional\r\napproval. Brazil can and should make an additional\r\ncontribution to nuclear disarmament. We want to take a\r\nconstructive part in discussions within the framework\r\ncreated by the indefinite extension of the NPT, the most\r\nuniversal of disarmament treaties. This is also the\r\nguideline for our participation in the Oslo conference and\r\nin the Ottawa process. Brazil stands firmly behind the\r\ninterdiction of landmines in all types of conflict.\r\nThe international community should do everything\r\nin its power to help poor countries devastated by war.\r\nThey suffer the perverse and prolonged effects of\r\nlandmines irresponsibly planted in their territories. The\r\ninterdiction of anti-personnel landmines and their removal\r\nmust become an effective commitment on the part of the\r\ninternational community. This a question of ethics, a\r\nquestion of observing the most elementary principles of\r\nhumanitarian law. We hope that the international\r\nconvention agreed upon in Oslo and the important\r\ncommitments it enshrines find universal acceptance.\r\nThese positive tendencies might lead to the\r\nimpression that the United Nations is less in demand\r\ntoday than 10, 20 or 50 years ago. This is a false\r\nimpression. We are still subject to the effects of\r\ndisintegrating factors. Some are, unfortunately,\r\nby-products of new global trends, such as marginalization\r\nwithin and among nations, transnational crime and\r\nconflicts of interest that find expression through violence\r\nand the threat or use of force.\r\nThe persistent and overbearing nature of terrorism\r\ncontinues to be one of the most serious threats to\r\ninternational peace and development. It breeds despair and\r\nsuffering. In the Middle East, terrorism and intolerance\r\njeopardize a peace process that was once full of promise\r\nfor the peoples of the region. In other countries, some of\r\nthem in Latin America, terrorist acts reveal the existence\r\nof groups that still insist on employing tactics\r\nincompatible with the values of civilization and human\r\ndignity. We must not falter in condemning those who, in\r\ndisregard of all moral values, resort to cowardly violence\r\nin seeking to advance their own obscure purposes. Brazil\r\nis emphatic in repelling these practices and exhorts the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\ninternational community to spare no effort in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, whatever its form or the alleged reasoning\r\nbehind it.\r\nIn addition, conflicts that had apparently been\r\nsurmounted by a spirit of understanding and constructive\r\naction on the part of the United Nations still show signs of\r\nresistance that demand a strong reaction from the\r\ninternational community. Angola is a case in point. Hope\r\nand promise cannot be constantly undermined by the factors\r\nthat have wrought so much destruction and suffering upon\r\na valiant people to whom we Brazilians feel so closely\r\nlinked. Angola is now a decisive test for the United\r\nNations. We cannot accept even the slightest possibility of\r\nregression. Brazil, currently holding the presidency of the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, calls upon\r\nthe international community, and in particular the members\r\nof the Security Council, to exercise close scrutiny over the\r\nAngolan peace process. We must do everything to ensure\r\nthat the people of Angola once again find the road of\r\ndevelopment in a context of democracy and pluralism.\r\nThe United Nations has an irreplaceable role in a\r\nworld that still combines forces of integration and\r\ncooperation with forces of disintegration and aggression.\r\nBut we have allowed the United Nations to lose its strength\r\nas an instrument of universal peace and understanding and\r\nas a promoter of cooperation and development. We have\r\ndone this through inaction, through a lack of consensus,\r\nthrough obstructionism and through excessive politicization\r\nof issues. We must react to this situation. We must once\r\nagain find the cardinal notion of leadership.\r\nThe past few years have shown that reform of the\r\nUnited Nations can no longer be put off. We cannot lose\r\nsight of major institutional issues or waste further precious\r\nenergy. The report of the Secretary-General entitled\r\n“Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform”\r\nis thus timely and opportune. The Brazilian Government\r\nwelcomes it with satisfaction and enthusiasm. The strength\r\nof our Organization derives from its universality and from\r\nthe all-encompassing nature of its mandate. The United\r\nNations must not be held to the performance of tasks better\r\nsuited to other international organizations or specialized\r\nagencies.\r\nWe cannot be made prisoners of inertia, nor must we\r\ncondemn our debates to irrelevancy. The General Assembly\r\nmust urgently move towards an agenda focused on what is\r\nessential to ensuring a relevant role for the United Nations\r\nin international affairs. For the United Nations to make a\r\ndifference and provide leadership in today’s complex world,\r\nit must recover the original meaning of the Charter by\r\nconcentrating on its essential mission: maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, promoting justice and\r\ninternational law, strengthening cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, protecting human rights and providing\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nMember States must create political conditions for\r\neffective action by the United Nations and make the\r\ncommitment to setting priorities and eliminating the\r\nsuperfluous. Only then will our Organization as a\r\nwhole — not just the Secretariat — be able to devote\r\nitself to those fundamental tasks. The Secretary-General\r\nhas assumed a leadership role by putting forth ideas that\r\nmust be objectively discussed by all Member States.\r\nBrazil is committed to working constructively with Mr.\r\nKofi Annan on his proposals to strengthen our\r\nOrganization.\r\nBrazil has taken an active part in the debate on\r\nreform of the Security Council. We have adopted an\r\nopen-minded and constructive approach because we\r\nbelieve this to be a central element in the reform of the\r\nOrganization. Brazil has upheld a concept of reform that\r\nwould strengthen the Council and the United Nations as\r\na whole. It is not geared to the individual interests of any\r\none country. We want the Council to be representative of\r\ncontemporary international realities, as it was in its early\r\nyears.\r\nThe Council must be enlarged both in its permanent\r\nmembership, to take account of the industrialized and the\r\ndeveloping worlds, and in its non-permanent membership,\r\nto allow for more frequent participation by interested\r\nStates. We repudiate all discrimination in the conception\r\nor assignment of new seats. We must not create a third or\r\nfourth category of member. This would weaken and\r\ndepreciate the participation of the developing world, and\r\nof Latin America in particular, in the reform process and\r\nin an enlarged Council.\r\nWe have always said that in identifying new\r\npermanent members we must exercise realism and\r\npragmatism by means of a democratic selection process\r\nthat leads to universally recognized representation without\r\nrenouncing regional support. Brazil has expressed,\r\nthrough President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, its\r\nwillingness to accept the responsibilities of permanent\r\nmembership in the Security Council, if called upon by the\r\ninternational community to do so. In such a case, Brazil\r\nwould be determined to carry out the role of permanent\r\nmember as the representative of Latin America and the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nCaribbean. We want our region to be present in the\r\nSecurity Council on a permanent basis and, through ample\r\ncoordination and consultation, to have an even stronger\r\ncollective voice.\r\nThe Brazilian Government notes with satisfaction that\r\nwe are moving, if not towards consensus, at least in the\r\ndirection of a significant majority in favour of certain basic\r\nnotions about how to reform the Security Council,\r\nparticularly enlargement of its permanent membership to\r\ntake account of the developing world. The proposal by\r\nAmbassador Razali, presently under discussion in the\r\nWorking Group, constitutes a firm basis for a negotiating\r\nprocess leading to a decision by the General Assembly.\r\nAmbassador Razali has helped us regain the ideal of\r\nCouncil reform as a means of strengthening the entire\r\nOrganization. Our priority is now to define the most\r\nsuitable format for an enlarged Security Council. This must\r\nbe the prime focus of attention.\r\nThe international community needs a strong, efficient\r\nand ever-present United Nations. We will continue to rely\r\non the political body with the universality and moral\r\nstrength that, in the history of humankind, only the United\r\nNations has been able to muster. We must display in this\r\nsession the determination to create the conditions for the\r\nUnited Nations to be an effective instrument for promoting\r\ninternational peace and security. The same spirit of\r\nleadership that we have seen in the Secretary-General and\r\nin Ambassador Razali has driven many delegations. A new\r\nwillingness to make a constructive contribution to the\r\nSecurity Council reform process and to other reforms is\r\nclearly felt by Member States. There is a new thrust to\r\nnegotiations. There is leadership, as well as carefully\r\ncrafted proposals. We must take advantage of this unique\r\nopportunity in the history of the United Nations. We must\r\nnot let the moment pass. Reform has become more than a\r\nkey concept; it has become the order of the day for the\r\nUnited Nations in 1997.\r\nLet us do it with that “fierce urgency of now” felt by\r\nMartin Luther King, a symbol of political leadership and of\r\nthe forces of change in our century. “This is no time”, said\r\nKing in his most famous speech,\r\n“to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the\r\ntranquillizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time...”.\r\nLet us do it, then.\r\nAddress by Mr. William Jefferson Clinton, President of\r\nthe United States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the United States of America.\r\nMr. William Jefferson Clinton, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the United States of America, His Excellency\r\nMr. William Jefferson Clinton, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Clinton: Five years ago, when I first\r\naddressed this Assembly, the cold war had only just\r\nended and the transition to a new era was beginning.\r\nNow, together, we are making that historic transition.\r\nBehind us, we leave a century full of humanity’s capacity\r\nfor the worst and its genius for the best. Before us, at the\r\ndawn of a new millennium, we can envision a new era\r\nthat escapes the twentieth century’s darkest moments,\r\nfulfils its most brilliant possibilities and crosses frontiers\r\nyet unimagined.\r\nWe are off to a promising start. For the first time in\r\nhistory, more than half the people represented in this\r\nAssembly freely choose their own Governments. Free\r\nmarkets are growing, spreading individual opportunity and\r\nnational well-being. Early in the twenty-first century,\r\nmore than 20 of this Assembly’s members — home to\r\nhalf the earth’s population — will lift themselves from\r\nthe ranks of low-income nations.\r\nPowerful forces are bringing us closer together,\r\nprofoundly changing the way we work, live and relate to\r\neach other. Every day, millions of our citizens on every\r\ncontinent use laptops and satellites to send information,\r\nproducts and money across the planet in seconds. Bit by\r\nbit, the information age is chipping away at barriers —\r\neconomic, political and social — that once kept people\r\nlocked in and ideas locked out. Science is unravelling\r\nmysteries in the tiniest of human genes and in the vast\r\ncosmos. Never in the course of human history have we\r\nhad a greater opportunity to make our people healthier\r\nand wiser, to protect our planet from decay and abuse and\r\nto reap the benefits of free markets without abandoning\r\nthe social contract and its concern for the common good.\r\nYet today’s possibilities are not tomorrow’s\r\nguarantees. We have work to do.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nThe forces of global integration are a great tide,\r\ninexorably wearing away the established order of things.\r\nBut we must decide what will be left in its wake. People\r\nfear change when they feel its burdens but not its benefits.\r\nThey are susceptible to misguided protectionism and to the\r\npoisoned appeals of extreme nationalism, and ethnic, racial\r\nand religious hatreds. New global environmental challenges\r\nrequire us to find ways to work together without damaging\r\nlegitimate aspirations for progress. We are all vulnerable to\r\nthe reckless acts of rogue States and to an unholy axis of\r\nterrorists, drug traffickers and international criminals.\r\nThese twenty-first-century predators feed on the free\r\nflow of information, ideas and people we cherish. They\r\nabuse the vast power of technology to build black markets\r\nfor weapons, to compromise law enforcement with huge\r\nbribes of illicit cash and to launder money with the\r\nkeystroke of a computer. These forces are our enemies. We\r\nmust face them together because no one can defeat them\r\nalone.\r\nTo seize the opportunities and move against the threats\r\nof this new global era, we need a new strategy of security.\r\nOver the past five years, nations have begun to put that\r\nstrategy in place through a new network of institutions and\r\narrangements, with distinct missions, but a common\r\npurpose: to secure and strengthen the gains of democracy\r\nand free markets while turning back their enemies.\r\nWe see this strategy taking shape on every continent:\r\nin expanded military alliances, such as the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO), its Partnership for Peace and\r\nits partnerships with a democratic Russia and a democratic\r\nUkraine; in free trade arrangements, such as the World\r\nTrade Organization and the global Information Technology\r\nAgreement, and in the movement towards free-trade areas\r\nby nations in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region and\r\nelsewhere around the world; in strong arms-control regimes,\r\nsuch as the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; in\r\nmultinational coalitions with zero tolerance for terrorism,\r\ncorruption, crime and drug trafficking; and in binding\r\ninternational commitments to protect the environment and\r\nsafeguard human rights.\r\nThrough this web of institutions and arrangements,\r\nnations are setting the international ground rules for the\r\ntwenty-first century, laying a foundation for security and\r\nprosperity for those who live within them, while isolating\r\nthose who challenge them from the outside. This system\r\nwill develop and endure only if those who follow the rules\r\nof peace and freedom fully reap their rewards. Only then\r\nwill our people believe that they have a stake in\r\nsupporting and shaping the emerging international system.\r\nThe United Nations must play a leading role in this\r\neffort, filling in the fault lines of the new global era. The\r\ncore missions it has pursued during its first half century\r\nwill be just as relevant during the next half century: the\r\npursuit of peace and security, promoting human rights and\r\nmoving people from poverty to dignity and prosperity\r\nthrough sustainable development.\r\nConceived in the cauldron of war, the United\r\nNations first task must remain the pursuit of peace and\r\nsecurity. For 50 years the United Nations has helped\r\nprevent world war and nuclear holocaust. Unfortunately,\r\nconflicts between nations, and within nations, have\r\nendured. From 1945 until today, they have cost 20 million\r\nlives. Just since the end of the cold war, each year there\r\nhave been more than 30 armed conflicts in which more\r\nthan 1,000 people have lost their lives — including, of\r\ncourse, a quarter of a million killed in the former\r\nYugoslavia and more than half a million in Rwanda.\r\nMillions of personal tragedies the world over are a\r\nwarning that we dare not be complacent or indifferent;\r\ntrouble in a far corner can become a plague on everyone’s\r\nhouse. People the world over cheer the hopeful\r\ndevelopments in Northern Ireland, grieve over the loss of\r\ninnocent lives and the stalling of the peace process in the\r\nMiddle East and long for a resolution of the differences\r\non the Korean peninsula, between Greece and Turkey or\r\nbetween the great nations of India and Pakistan as they\r\ncelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of their birth.\r\nThe United Nations continues to keep many nations\r\naway from bloodshed: in El Salvador and Mozambique;\r\nin Haiti and Namibia; in Cyprus; and in Bosnia, where so\r\nmuch remains to be done but can still be done because\r\nthe bloodshed has ended.\r\nThe United Nations record of service has left a\r\nlegacy of sacrifice. Just last week we lost some of our\r\nfinest sons and daughters in the crash of a United Nations\r\nhelicopter in Bosnia. Five were American, five German,\r\none Polish and one British — all citizens of the world we\r\nare trying to make, each a selfless servant of peace. The\r\nworld is poorer for their passing.\r\nAt this very moment, the United Nations is keeping\r\nthe peace in 16 countries, often in partnership with\r\nregional organizations such as NATO, the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, the Association of South-East Asian\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nNations and the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates, avoiding wider conflicts and even greater suffering.\r\nOur shared commitment to more realistic peacekeeping\r\ntraining for United Nations troops, a stronger role for\r\ncivilian police and better integration between military and\r\ncivilian agencies — all these will help the United Nations\r\nfulfil these missions in the years ahead.\r\nAt the same time, we must improve the United\r\nNations capabilities after a conflict ends to help peace\r\nbecome self-sustaining. The United Nations cannot build\r\nnations, but it can help nations build themselves by\r\nfostering legitimate institutions of government, monitoring\r\nelections and laying a strong foundation for economic\r\nreconstruction.\r\nThis week the Security Council will hold an\r\nunprecedented ministerial meeting on African security,\r\nwhich our Secretary of State is proud to chair, and which\r\nPresident Mugabe, Chairman of the Organization of African\r\nUnity, will address. It will highlight the role the United\r\nNations can and should play in preventing conflict on a\r\ncontinent where amazing progress towards democracy and\r\ndevelopment is occurring alongside still too much discord,\r\ndisease and distress.\r\nIn the twenty-first century our security will be\r\nchallenged increasingly by interconnected groups that traffic\r\nin terror, organized crime and drug smuggling. Already,\r\nthese international crime and drug syndicates drain up to\r\n$750 billion a year from legitimate economies. That sum\r\nthat exceeds the combined gross national product of more\r\nthan half the nations in this Hall. These groups threaten to\r\nundermine confidence in the fragile new democracies and\r\nmarket economies that so many of you are working so hard\r\nto see endure.\r\nTwo years ago I called upon all the members of this\r\nAssembly to join in the fight against these forces. I applaud\r\nthe recent United Nations resolution calling on its Members\r\nto join the major international anti-terrorism conventions,\r\nmaking clear the emerging international consensus that\r\nterrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable political\r\nact. As more countries sign on, terrorists will have fewer\r\nplaces to run or hide. I also applaud the steps that Members\r\nare taking to implement the Declaration on Crime and\r\nPublic Security that the United States proposed two years\r\nago, calling for increased cooperation to strengthen every\r\ncitizen’s right to basic safety, through cooperation on\r\nextradition and asset forfeiture, shutting down grey markets\r\nfor guns and false documents, attacking corruption and\r\nbringing higher standards to law enforcement in new\r\ndemocracies.\r\nThe spread of these global criminal syndicates also\r\nhas made all the more urgent our common quest to\r\neliminate weapons of mass destruction. We cannot allow\r\nthem to fall into or remain in the wrong hands. Here too,\r\nthe United Nations must lead, and it has led — from the\r\nUnited Nations Special Commission in Iraq to the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, now the most\r\nexpansive global inspection system ever devised to police\r\narms-control agreements.\r\nWhen we met here last year, I was honoured to be\r\nthe first of 146 leaders to sign the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), our commitment to end\r\nall nuclear tests for all time, the longest-sought, hardest-\r\nfought prize in the history of arms control. It will help\r\nprevent the nuclear Powers from developing more\r\nadvanced and more dangerous weapons. It will limit the\r\npossibilities for other States to acquire such devices. I am\r\npleased to announce that today I am sending this crucial\r\nTreaty to the United States Senate for ratification. Our\r\ncommon goal should be for the CTBT to enter into force\r\nas soon as possible. I ask for of you to support that goal.\r\nThe United Nations second core mission must be to\r\ndefend and extend universal human rights and to help\r\ndemocracy’s remarkable gains endure. Fifty years ago the\r\nUnited Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nstated the international community’s conviction that\r\npeople everywhere have the right to be treated with\r\ndignity, to give voice to their opinions and to choose their\r\nleaders; that these rights are universal — not American\r\nrights, not Western rights, not rights for the developed\r\nworld only, but rights inherent in the humanity of people\r\neverywhere.\r\nOver the past decades these rights have become a\r\nreality for more people than ever, from Asia to Africa,\r\nfrom Europe to the Americas. In a world that links rich\r\nand poor, North and South, city and countryside in an\r\nelectronic network of shared images in real time, the\r\nmore these universal rights take hold, the more people\r\nwho do not enjoy them will demand them. Armed with\r\nphotocopiers and fax machines, e-mail and the Internet;\r\nsupported by an increasingly important community of\r\nnon-governmental organizations, they will make their\r\ndemands known, spreading the spirit of freedom —\r\nwhich, as the history of the last 10 years has shown us,\r\nultimately will prevail.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nThe United Nations must be prepared to respond —\r\nnot only by setting standards but by implementing them. To\r\ndeter abuses, we should strengthen the United Nations field\r\noperations and early-warning systems. To strengthen\r\ndemocratic institutions — the best guarantors of human\r\nrights — we must pursue programmes to help new legal,\r\nparliamentary and electoral institutions get off the ground.\r\nTo punish those responsible for crimes against humanity,\r\nand to promote justice so that peace endures, we must\r\nmaintain our strong support for the United Nations war-\r\ncrime tribunals and truth commissions. And before the\r\ncentury ends, we should establish a permanent international\r\ncourt to prosecute the most serious violations of\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nThe United States welcomes the Secretary General’s\r\nefforts to strengthen the role of human rights within the\r\nUnited Nations system and his splendid choice of Mary\r\nRobinson as the new High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights. We will work hard to make sure that she has the\r\nsupport she needs to carry out her mandate.\r\nFinally, the United Nations has a special responsibility\r\nto make sure that as the global economy creates greater\r\nwealth, it does not produce growing disparities between the\r\nhaves and have-nots or threaten the global environment, our\r\ncommon home. Progress is not yet everyone’s partner.\r\nMore than half the world’s people are two days’ walk from\r\na telephone, literally disconnected from the global economy.\r\nTens of millions lack the education, the training and the\r\nskills they need to make the most of their God-given\r\nabilities.\r\nThe men and women of the United Nations have\r\nexpertise across the entire range of humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment activities. Every day they are making a\r\ndifference. We see it in nourished bodies of once-starving\r\nchildren, in the full lives of those immunized against\r\ndisease, in the bright eyes of children exposed to education\r\nthrough the rich storehouse of human knowledge, in\r\nrefugees cared for and returned to their homes and in the\r\nhealth of rivers and lakes restored.\r\nThe United Nations must focus even more on shifting\r\nresources from handouts to “hand ups”, on giving people\r\nthe tools they need to make the most of their own destinies.\r\nSpreading ideas and education and technology — the true\r\nwealth of nations — is the best way to give the people the\r\nchance to succeed.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to lead in ensuring\r\nthat today’s progress does not come at tomorrow’s expense.\r\nWhen the nations of the world gather again next\r\nDecember in Kyoto for the Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange, all of us — developed and developing nations —\r\nmust seize the opportunity to turn back the clock on\r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions so that we can leave a healthy\r\nplanet to our children.\r\nIn these efforts, the United Nations no longer can,\r\nand no longer need, go it alone. Innovative partnerships\r\nwith the private sector, non-governmental organizations\r\nand the international financial institutions can leverage its\r\neffectiveness many times over. Last week a truly\r\nvisionary American, Ted Turner, made a remarkable\r\ndonation to strengthen the United Nations development\r\nand humanitarian programmes. His gesture highlights the\r\npotential for partnership between the United Nations and\r\nthe private sector, in contributions of time, resources and\r\nexpertise. I hope more will follow his lead.\r\nIn this area and others, the Secretary-General is\r\naggressively pursuing the most far-reaching reform of the\r\nUnited Nations in its history — not to make the United\r\nNations smaller as an end in itself, but to make it better.\r\nThe United States strongly supports his leadership. We\r\nshould pass the Secretary-General’s reform agenda at this\r\nsession.\r\nOn every previous occasion I have addressed this\r\nAssembly, the issue of our country’s dues has brought the\r\ncommitment of the United States to the United Nations\r\ninto question. The United States was a founder of the\r\nUnited Nations. We are proud to be its host. We believe\r\nin its ideals. We continue to be, as we have been, its\r\nlargest contributor. We are committed to seeing the\r\nUnited Nations succeed in the twenty-first century.\r\nThis year, for the first time since I have been\r\nPresident, we have an opportunity to put the question of\r\ndebts and dues behind us once and for all and to put the\r\nUnited Nations on a sounder financial footing for the\r\nfuture. I have made it a priority to work with our\r\nCongress on comprehensive legislation that would allow\r\nus to pay off the bulk of our arrears and assure full\r\nfinancing of America’s assessment in the years ahead.\r\nOur Congress’s actions to solve this problem reflect a\r\nstrong bipartisan commitment to the United Nations and\r\nto America’s role within it. At the same time, we look to\r\nMember States to adopt a more equitable scale of\r\nassessments. Let me say that we also strongly support\r\nexpanding the Security Council to give more countries a\r\nvoice in the most important work of the United Nations.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nIn more equitably sharing responsibility for its successes,\r\nwe can make the United Nations stronger and more\r\ndemocratic than it is today. I ask the General Assembly to\r\nact on these proposals this year so that we can move\r\nforward together.\r\nAt the dawn of a new century so full of hope but not\r\nfree of peril, more than ever we need a United Nations\r\nwhere people of reason can work through shared problems\r\nand take action to combat them, where nations of goodwill\r\ncan join in the struggle for freedom and prosperity and\r\nwhere we can shape a future of peace, progress and the\r\npreservation of our planet. We have the knowledge; we\r\nhave the intelligence; we have the energy; we have the\r\nresources for the work before us. We are building the\r\nnecessary networks of cooperation. The great question\r\nremaining is whether we have the vision and the heart\r\nnecessary to imagine a future that is different from the\r\npast — necessary to free ourselves from destructive patterns\r\nof relations with each other and within our own nations and\r\nto live a future that is different.\r\nA new century in a new millennium is upon us. We\r\nare literally present at the future, and it is the great gift we\r\nare obligated to leave to our children.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. William Jefferson Clinton, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Denmark\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nDenmark.\r\nMr. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Denmark, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Denmark, Mr. Poul\r\nNyrup Rasmussen, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Rasmussen (Denmark): First of all, I would\r\nlike to refer to the intervention which will be made\r\ntomorrow by the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. I should also like to\r\ncongratulate the Foreign Minister of Ukraine on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly.\r\nAllow me to reflect a bit on the fact that three\r\ndecades ago a Danish Prime Minister, Mr. Jens Otto\r\nKrag, presented our yearly address to the twenty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The challenges of today\r\nare not very similar to those of that time, and yet they are\r\nno less complex nor of lesser magnitude. For the United\r\nNations to face these challenges, the Organization must\r\nadapt. It must reform, must change and must modernize.\r\nThat is why reform must be a priority for this session of\r\nthe General Assembly. And that, in all humility, is why\r\nI am here today: to support the Secretary-General and the\r\nGeneral Assembly and to do what I can on behalf of my\r\ncountry in order to reach our goal at the end of this\r\nsession and to help make decisions that are necessary in\r\norder to modernize and to reform.\r\nSince the twenty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly, 30 years ago, we have seen disappointments.\r\nWe have seen civil wars. We have seen frustrations,\r\nbacklashes and incredible suffering. Yet we have also\r\nseen light. We have seen peace where war once raged.\r\nWe have seen former enemies living peacefully together.\r\nIndeed, we have seen apartheid disappear. We have seen\r\nthe Berlin Wall fall. We have seen the oppressed coming\r\nout of jails and being elected leaders of their countries,\r\nand some of them rank among the world’s most\r\noutstanding leaders. We have seen the winds of change\r\nsweep over entire continents.\r\nI believe this: if our generation cannot believe in the\r\nimpossible, who can? If our generation cannot take the\r\ndecisions that are necessary, who else can? All in all, I\r\nthink this is of crucial importance for the United Nations.\r\nA reform programme for the United Nations is not\r\nonly about a more efficient use of scarce resources. It is\r\nalso, and more importantly, about strengthening and\r\nrevitalizing the Organization so that it can effectively\r\ncarry out its core activities and meet the challenges of the\r\nfuture. It must be a reform closer to the people, a reform\r\ncloser to non-governmental organizations and\r\nparliamentarians, a reform unifying Governments, the\r\nUnited Nations and peoples.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nThe core activities and priorities are very clearly\r\ndescribed in the Secretary-General’s reform programme.\r\nWith great precision and clarity, the Secretary-General has\r\nspelled out elements that my Government fully subscribes\r\nto: peace and security, economic and social affairs;\r\ndevelopment cooperation; humanitarian affairs; and, as an\r\nactivity cutting across the others, human rights — because\r\nhuman rights makes the United Nations the people’s United\r\nNations. These core functions of the United Nations are\r\ninterdependent and mutually supportive. No amount of\r\nfunding will create sustainable development without peace,\r\ngood governance and respect for human rights. None of our\r\nefforts in the field of peace and security or humanitarian\r\nrelief will have a lasting effect without efforts to create\r\nsustainable development.\r\nDenmark gives its full support to the reform\r\nprogramme of the Secretary-General. We consider the\r\nprogramme, in its totality, to be a significant contribution\r\ntowards strengthening the Organization and towards making\r\nit more responsive, legitimate and efficient. I also note the\r\nspirit of the Secretary-General in creating much greater\r\nmotivation among the employees of the United Nations and\r\nmuch shorter lines between the Secretary-General and all\r\nthe rest of the people working for our common goal and\r\ncause, here in this House and all around the world.\r\nReform is about shifting resources to the core\r\nfunctions of the United Nations: shifting resources from\r\nadministration to development — in short, getting more\r\nvalue for money, centrally, on the national level and\r\nlocally.\r\nThe reform programme constitutes a package. It\r\nshould be dealt with by the General Assembly as such. The\r\nprogramme as a whole should receive the political\r\nendorsement of the Assembly in the coming weeks. My\r\ncountry endorses the package fully and wholly.\r\nGround-breaking work has been carried out on the\r\nway towards Security Council reform. Expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Council is essential to enhance its\r\nlegitimacy. At the same time, its effectiveness and decision-\r\nmaking capacity must be safeguarded. But — and I think\r\nthat there is a “but” — we must unify in order to reform.\r\nWe are gathered to reform, to open a new chapter of\r\nreforming and modernizing the United Nations.\r\nIt has to be said that no institution can discharge its\r\nfunctions without a sound financial basis. Member States’\r\nfulfilment of their financial obligations must be considered\r\nthe touchstone of their attachment to the United Nations. I\r\nam not a billionaire; I am probably not even a millionaire.\r\nI am the Prime Minister of my country, and I know the\r\nway to go. I know, on behalf of my country, our\r\nobligations. I also know, on behalf of my country, the\r\nfinancial duties my country has. I therefore hope that this\r\nsession will also be a turning point for all Member\r\ncountries of the United Nations, because a sound financial\r\nbasis first and foremost requires that Member States pay\r\ntheir contributions in full, on time and without any\r\nconditions. The contributions of Member States must be\r\nbased on their capacity to pay. Therefore let us join, as\r\nwe have done on the reform process, to finance the\r\nUnited Nations on its path to the next century.\r\nPolitical instability, violence and the collapse of the\r\nstructures of society have led to massive movements of\r\nrefugee populations. Large numbers of people — millions\r\nof people — have fled to regions far from their homes.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about this situation. We must do\r\nour utmost to support the humanitarian organizations in\r\ntheir efforts to assist refugees and other displaced persons\r\nas close to their local environments as possible: as close\r\nto their homes as possible.\r\nYet refugees and other displaced persons cannot\r\nreturn to their homes so long as anti-personnel mines\r\nremain scattered throughout the countryside, so long as\r\nhuman beings by the thousand are being injured or killed\r\nwhen they work their fields, so long as children cannot go\r\nto school without risking losing a limb on their way.\r\nMr. Secretary-General, you said it yourself in your\r\nspeech in Oslo: you underlined that the very presence, or\r\njust the fear of the presence, of only one mine can stop\r\nthe work in a whole village, can stop the work in a whole\r\nfield, can make it impossible for families, or whole\r\nvillages, to survive and to create proper living conditions.\r\nWe must realize that, without mines, we would have\r\ncountries that could double or triple their agricultural\r\nproduction and thereby help themselves. We must get rid\r\nof these anti-personnel mines and must do it today rather\r\nthan tomorrow.\r\nI look forward to the day when the last anti-\r\npersonnel mine has been produced. That will be a good\r\nday for mankind. I look forward to the day when the last\r\nanti-personnel mine has been removed. That will be a\r\ngood day for mankind, and that day must come soon. I\r\nlook forward to the day when a United Nations\r\nconvention will settle this matter so that it never comes\r\nbefore us again.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nWe must at the same time work at improving the basic\r\nconditions of life for ordinary people in areas of conflict.\r\nOnly in this way can we prevent people from becoming\r\npermanent refugees.\r\nIn the past year we have once again experienced how\r\nquickly crises can break out in different parts of the world.\r\nThis underlines the need for the international community to\r\nbe able to react swiftly and in unity in order to prevent the\r\nspread of violence and human suffering. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has noted, my country, Denmark, has taken the\r\ninitiative to establish a multinational standby high readiness\r\nbrigade (SHIRBRIG) within the framework of United\r\nNations standby agreements. The planning element for the\r\nbrigade was officially inaugurated by the Secretary-General\r\nearlier this month in my country. The initiative is being\r\ntaken to increase the rapid-reaction capability, and it must\r\nbe carried forward. Improvements in the planning capacity\r\nof the United Nations are under way and will help reduce\r\nthe overall response time.\r\nCapacity within other areas must be enhanced as well.\r\nCivilian police has proved crucial in many of the recent\r\noperations. We must improve both the capacity and the\r\ntraining of civilian police officers.\r\nNext year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of a\r\nmajor achievement in the history of mankind: the 1948\r\nadoption by the General Assembly of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. The noble object of the\r\nDeclaration is the protection of individuals — not the\r\ninterests of States. All human beings are equal and deserve\r\nequal protection against abuse. Therefore the standards of\r\nthe Declaration are by their very nature universal. Any\r\ndenunciation of human rights obligations is unacceptable\r\nand demonstrates a lack of respect for human dignity.\r\nOn the subject of credibility, I wish to underline that\r\na connection must also be made between violence and\r\nhuman rights violations and the consequences. I think,\r\ntherefore, that a significant recent development since the\r\nadoption of the Declaration is the establishment of the\r\noffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. I\r\nwelcome the new High Commissioner, Mrs. Mary\r\nRobinson. She will receive our full support in her\r\nendeavours to promote and ensure universal respect for\r\nhuman rights.\r\nBut respect for human rights demands also\r\ninternational justice. After the Nuremberg trials we all\r\nbelieved that the Holocaust would never happen again, and\r\nyet new genocides are haunting us. Therefore, we need a\r\npermanent international criminal court. We will not allow\r\ncrimes against humanity to go unpunished. This is a\r\nfundamental question of credibility, a fundamental\r\nquestion of consequence and of justice. Setting a precise\r\ndate for a diplomatic conference in 1998 is essential to\r\nmaintain the momentum for the early establishment of the\r\ncourt, by the end of this decade.\r\nThe need to assist the poorest countries is as\r\nimportant as ever. The poorest countries do not, I believe,\r\nattract sufficient private capital flows, nor do they have\r\nthe potential to benefit from the liberalization of\r\ninternational trade. It is time for action. It is time to\r\nnarrow the gap between rhetoric and action. I would\r\nremind the Assembly of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen, and I would recall the\r\nobligations undertaken there and our vision of narrowing\r\nthe gap between rhetoric and practical action. Education,\r\nhealth and participation for women are fundamentals.\r\nThe role of the United Nations system in the field of\r\neconomic and social development is indispensable. I\r\nshould like to emphasize in particular the importance of\r\nthe United Nations as an Organization operating with a\r\nglobal mandate and on the basis of a global approach of\r\nsustainable development, security and good governance.\r\nLet me mention by way of example the World\r\nConference on Women, held in Beijing. It should be a\r\nprimary task for the United Nations system to ensure an\r\neffective follow-up to these conferences.\r\nThe United Nations should be at the forefront of the\r\nglobal efforts to ensure sustainable development for all.\r\nAnd yet let us be direct, clear and honest. The United\r\nNations development organizations concerned are entirely\r\ndependent on voluntary contributions, and these have,\r\nregrettably, followed a decreasing trend in recent years. I\r\nthink it is fair to say that the United Nations development\r\norganizations themselves can be partly blamed for the\r\nemerging funding crisis. All too often they have failed to\r\ncooperate. Many donors have been frustrated to see\r\nUnited Nations organizations engage in a costly\r\ncompetition for funds. The mere fact that it has not been\r\npossible until now for the United Nations organizations to\r\nestablish common premises at the country level is an\r\nexample of this situation.\r\nHere again I feel that the Secretary-General’s reform\r\nproposals are a significant contribution towards redressing\r\nthis unfortunate situation. Let us have one coordinated\r\nUnited Nations house in each country, and let us not\r\ncompete among United Nations organizations but\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\ncooperate effectively. That is a vision that we want to\r\nfollow and to support.\r\nThe many, many problems faced by minorities in our\r\nworld, and not least by indigenous peoples, must be\r\naddressed in a coherent manner. We must ensure that\r\nindigenous peoples are given real influence on matters\r\npertaining to them.\r\nThat is why my country, Denmark — in close\r\ncooperation with the indigenous population of Greenland —\r\nhas called upon the United Nations and its Member States\r\nto establish, within the framework of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, a permanent forum for indigenous peoples.\r\nThis forum should have a broad mandate to cover a wide\r\nrange of issues. Indigenous peoples themselves must be\r\nensured the possibility of active and effective participation\r\nin its establishment and in its function.\r\nThe United Nations is the future for all of us on this\r\nglobe — a future that can be improved by closer\r\ncooperation with regional organizations. This cooperation\r\nmust be strengthened. Since the political changes in Europe\r\nthat began at the end of the 1980s, the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has taken on\r\nan important role in that region. This role is a natural\r\nexpression of its status as a regional arrangement under\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. The\r\nOSCE cooperates closely with the United Nations in a\r\nnumber of areas. By taking on responsibility within its own\r\ngeographical area, the OSCE contributes to the United\r\nNations ability to deal with crises elsewhere.\r\nAs Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, my Foreign\r\nMinister has given high priority to strengthening the\r\nrelationship between the OSCE and the United Nations. We\r\nhave frequent contact with the Secretary-General and have\r\nencouraged closer relations between the secretariats.\r\nLet me conclude. It is time for reform, as the\r\nSecretary-General so wisely said, and I should like in this\r\nconnection to make three points.\r\nMy first point is that the reform programme put\r\nforward by the Secretary-General deserves our full support.\r\nIf adopted, it will leave this Organization in much better\r\nshape. For the sake of our common future this is needed.\r\nLet us decide and let us follow up.\r\nMy second point is this: we need the United Nations,\r\nand the United Nations needs us. We must ensure the\r\nnecessary funding for the world Organization and its\r\ndevelopment agencies. We must do this to make the\r\nworld a better and safer place. Every Member must pay\r\nin full, on time, without conditions.\r\nFinally, my third point: we must address the negative\r\nlegacies of the past. We cannot solve the problem of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons without making it possible\r\nfor them to return to their homes. They cannot and will\r\nnot do that as long as their physical well-being is\r\nthreatened by inhumane anti-personnel mines and as long\r\nas their political future is threatened by war criminals\r\nwho have not been brought to justice.\r\nHuman rights are not just about words. It should also\r\nbe a human right to be able to live a secure life. At the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen,\r\nwe said, “You cannot any longer have secure States\r\nwithout secure people inside”. This is what we need the\r\nUnited Nations to help us with.\r\nThis is not a perfect world, but I remain an optimist.\r\nWith the United Nations as an organization for the people\r\nand by the people, we can make this world a better place.\r\nLet us join hands to make the twenty-first century a\r\nhappier one.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of\r\nDenmark for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Denmark, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Major-General\r\nSitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka, Prime Minister,\r\nMinister with Special Responsibility for the\r\nConstitution Review and Minister for Regional\r\nDevelopment and Multi-Ethnic Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Fiji\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by The Honourable Major-General Sitiveni\r\nLigamamada Rabuka, Prime Minister, Minister with\r\nSpecial Responsibility for the Constitution Review and\r\nMinister for Regional Development and Multi-Ethnic\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Fiji.\r\nThe Honourable Major-General Sitiveni\r\nLigamamada Rabuka, Prime Minister, Minister with\r\nSpecial Responsibility for the Constitution Review\r\nand Minister for Regional Development and Multi-\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nEthnic Affairs of the Republic of Fiji, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming the\r\nPrime Minister, Minister with Special Responsibility for the\r\nConstitution Review and Minister for Regional\r\nDevelopment and Multi-Ethnic Affairs of the Republic of\r\nFiji, His Excellency The Honourable Major-General Sitiveni\r\nLigamamada Rabuka, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMajor-General Rabuka (Fiji): My country and my\r\ndelegation warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsecond session. Your election to this high office is a tribute\r\nboth to you and to your great country, Ukraine. I wish to\r\nassure you of my delegation’s fullest cooperation during\r\nyour tenure of office.\r\nIt also gives me great pleasure to convey our profound\r\ngratitude and appreciation to the outgoing president of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session, Ambassador\r\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia, who presided over the session\r\nwith such consummate skill, expertise and diplomacy, and\r\ndistinguished himself by his firm management of the\r\nsession through his dedication to and thoroughness in the\r\ndischarge of his assignment.\r\nI am also pleased to extend our sincerest\r\ncongratulations to the new Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan. My delegation is convinced that\r\nMr. Annan will make an outstanding contribution to the\r\nrole and responsibilities of the United Nations in\r\ninternational affairs and to the management of the\r\nOrganization. We wish to reassure him of our fullest\r\ncooperation during his tenure of office.\r\nThe greatest challenge facing our world today is\r\neconomic development, specifically the promotion of\r\nsustained economic growth with equitable social\r\ndevelopment, particularly in the developing countries of the\r\nworld. For small island developing States like Fiji, and for\r\nmany developing countries of the world in general, we need\r\nan international economic environment that is buttressed by\r\neconomic justice. We need an international economic\r\nenvironment that ensures a better life in all the countries of\r\nthe world and not in just a few. The slow pace of economic\r\ndevelopment and even the lack of such development in\r\nmany countries of the world, circumscribed by the evils of\r\nunemployment and poverty, are threats to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThis greatest challenge is growing more and more\r\nacute as economic development is being retarded by a\r\nnumber of policies, trends and unilateral actions which\r\npervade our world today. Our development policies, plans\r\nand programmes are being seriously eroded by difficulties\r\nin accessing the markets of the developed countries,\r\nworsening terms of trade, inadequate capital flow for\r\ninvestment, spiralling debt burdens, protectionist\r\ntendencies, ambivalence in the transfer of technologies\r\nand exchange-rate volatility. Small countries like mine,\r\nand indeed all developing nations, have no real influence\r\nin these matters, except as victims.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations calls for the\r\npromotion of the international economic and social\r\nadvancement of all peoples. Implicit, if not explicit, in it\r\nis embedded the principle of economic justice. As\r\nMembers of the United Nations, we have a collective\r\nmoral and humanitarian obligation to help and assist each\r\nother. We have a collective duty to make our world a\r\nbetter place to live in. The time has come for the\r\ndeveloped nations of the world, and all international\r\norganizations which can help, to cooperate and ensure\r\njustice by enabling developing countries in their own\r\nefforts towards the acceleration of sustained economic and\r\nsocial development.\r\nThere are a number of ways in which the developing\r\ncountries can be assisted towards achieving sustained\r\neconomic and social development. Developing countries,\r\neven those endowed with natural resources, are\r\nhandicapped by a lack of capital to mobilize these\r\nresources to their advantage. Developing countries need\r\ncontinuous foreign-direct-investment capital flows to\r\nstimulate and sustain economic growth. Both foreign\r\ndirect investment and private-sector investment are needed\r\nto help diversify and increase economic activities,\r\nespecially where industrialization is an option.\r\nThrough the diversification of our economies we can\r\nproduce more for export and trade. In fact, trade is the\r\nbest means for sustained income generation and\r\ndevelopment. The present globalized international trade is\r\nideally aimed at ensuring an open, secure, equitable,\r\ntransparent and predictable multilateral system wherein all\r\nparticipants can benefit.\r\nThe reality we face is very different from this\r\nespoused ideal. We do not live in an ideal world, but in\r\nthe real world, where international trade is dominated by\r\nthe industrialized, developed nations. Fiji and other\r\ndeveloping and least-developed countries of the world\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nhave to compete for markets with industrial giants. The\r\ninternational-trade playing field is not level, despite\r\nfrequent statements to that effect. In reality, there is no\r\neven playing field. It is in truth marked by inequalities of\r\npower, influence and resources, with steep and almost\r\ninsurmountable heights constraining small nations like ours.\r\nIn order for small countries like Fiji to survive and to\r\ndevelop, we must be allowed to retain special arrangements\r\nfor our essential exports, which give our people social and\r\neconomic security.\r\nMy country firmly believes that globalization is the\r\nphenomenon of today’s international trade. The\r\ntransformation of international trade rules from the Uruguay\r\nRound to the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been\r\nmarked by rapid changes that can marginalize small\r\ndeveloping countries like mine.\r\nThe appellate body of the WTO has significantly\r\nnarrowed the scope of the General Agreement on Tariffs\r\nand Trade (GATT)/WTO waiver to the European\r\nCommunity in respect of the Lomé Convention. Fiji is\r\namong other African, Caribbean and Pacific countries\r\nwhich will be adversely affected by these new arrangements\r\nif the arrangements of the Lomé Conventions are eroded.\r\nFurthermore, it has opened up room for policies and\r\nactions, leaving weak developing countries unprotected and\r\nexposed to economic stagnation.\r\nWhile the WTO is insisting on a level-playing-field\r\napproach, peculiarities that pose problems for small island\r\ndeveloping countries persist. As for Fiji, our smallness,\r\nremoteness and inaccessibility to foreign markets remain\r\nour biggest hurdles in international trade. Annual natural\r\ndisasters, a consequence of the climatic conditions in our\r\nlocation, continue to be a big drain on the Government’s\r\nsavings in terms of rehabilitation projects. Such angry\r\nseasonal visitations of nature can wreak havoc on budget\r\nplans and our scarce resources.\r\nSmall island States like Fiji have a very limited range\r\nand volume of exports and they cannot and will not\r\ndominate and overwhelm any sector of trade commodities.\r\nIn that context, my delegation is extremely disappointed at\r\nthe recent decision of the World Trade Organization appeal\r\nbody against banana exports from Caribbean countries to\r\nthe European Union.\r\nWe are not asking for favours. We are merely making\r\na plea for a sensible and reasonable transition period to\r\nenable us to adjust. This cannot be done overnight; thus,\r\nspecial arrangements must remain to allow us the\r\nopportunity to find means for accommodation and\r\nreplacement.\r\nThe blind pursuit of free trade, resulting in dire\r\nconsequences for small nations and leading to the loss of\r\nother fundamental freedoms, will not serve the purposes\r\nof eradicating poverty and eliminating social and\r\neconomic inequalities. We seek an equality of opportunity\r\nin a world dominated by inequalities of resources and\r\neconomic might.\r\nThe World Trade Organization must bring a sense of\r\nequity and justice in its deliberations and decisions, and\r\nconsciously eschew paths which disadvantage even further\r\nalready disadvantaged developing nations. We seek an\r\nequality of understanding for the position of the weak and\r\nthe small. We seek the creation of genuine freedom in\r\ntrade, for trade remains the best means for sustained\r\ndevelopment for developing nations.\r\nThe access of developing countries to new,\r\nenvironmentally sound technologies is also pivotal to\r\neconomic development and sustained economic growth.\r\nThere is a need for developing countries like Fiji to\r\nparticipate in, benefit from and contribute to the rapid\r\nadvances in the technologies of developed, industrialized\r\ncountries. Developing countries should be facilitated\r\naccess to reliable information on environmentally sound\r\ntechnologies and helped in institutional development and\r\ncapacity-building to accommodate the transfer of such\r\ntechnologies. Accessibility to knowledge for development\r\nis a right, the right of all nations, not merely of a\r\npowerful few to retain as a monopoly for their own\r\nselfish ends.\r\nOfficial development assistance is an important\r\ncatalyst for development, yet its value remains unrealized.\r\nOnly four countries have met or surpassed the official\r\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product. A renewed commitment to this target is\r\nessential in order to fulfil the imperatives established by\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. At this stage of our\r\ndevelopment, it is a much needed catalyst to our own\r\nefforts.\r\nExternal debt repayments continue to be a major\r\nconstraint on economic development and sustained\r\neconomic growth in major developing countries.\r\nBurdensome debt repayments not only cause economic\r\ndevelopment to stagnate, but stifle social development as\r\nwell. I call for the adoption of an effective and equitable\r\ndevelopment-oriented solution to the debt problem, so that\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nit ceases to be a burden yet remains a useful tool for\r\nsustained development.\r\nI have emphasized economic growth for sustained\r\ndevelopment as the direction we must pursue. My country\r\nand Government are fully committed to this goal. Yet, for\r\neconomic growth to be sustainable, as well as beneficial\r\nand of quality, the environmental factor must be brought to\r\nthe forefront in all our development efforts.\r\nDespite the convening of the recent special session of\r\nthe General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review\r\nof the implementation of Agenda 21, there are still no clear\r\ncommitments on the part of many developed countries to\r\nwork towards achieving such environmental goals as, for\r\ninstance, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to\r\ninternationally specified levels. The South Pacific Forum\r\nisland countries are among the most vulnerable to climate\r\nchange in terms of sea level rise and global warming. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that all members of the international\r\ncommunity should strive for a firm political commitment\r\nbefore the next Kyoto Conference, to adopt a stronger\r\nprotocol to strengthen the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation joins others in\r\nexpressing our appreciation to the private sector and civil\r\nsociety for the supportive interest they have shown in the\r\nsearch for an acceptable international solution to such\r\nglobal concerns. A most welcome demonstration of this is\r\nthe recent donation of $1 billion by the Turner Foundation\r\nin support of certain crucial activities of the United Nations.\r\nWe need more of such assistance to further sustain and\r\nstrengthen the work of the United Nations in achieving its\r\ntargets.\r\nI would now like to turn my attention to the issue of\r\ninternational security. Today we are witnessing a most\r\nsignificant period of change in our world, a change which\r\nbodes well for permanent and lasting peace and security.\r\nThe cold war has been over for some time now and the\r\ntensions and threats to peace and security which it\r\ngenerated are behind us. As a consequence, and with the\r\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT), we have moved a step further towards nuclear\r\ndisarmament. While this is gratifying, there is much more\r\nto be done to achieve the objective of our Organization to\r\nturn our swords into ploughshares and our spears into\r\npruning hooks.\r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has\r\nadded to the impressive list of political and legal\r\ninstruments intended to de-escalate the production and\r\nstockpiling of nuclear weapons. We have come a long\r\nway in our efforts to prevent a nuclear holocaust on our\r\nplanet, but the existence and improvement of nuclear\r\nweapons still leaves the threat over us. The current\r\ninternational situation creates a favourable condition for\r\nthe international community, and particularly nuclear-\r\nweapon States, to take steps towards eliminating nuclear\r\nweapons from our planet. While the CTBT is a step in\r\nthe right direction, it lacks a clear time-frame for the\r\nremoval of all nuclear weapons from our midst.\r\nMy delegation urges the international community to\r\nbegin negotiations as soon as possible on a treaty to halt\r\nand prohibit, with acceptable verification, the production\r\nand development of all nuclear weapons. My delegation\r\nfurther urges the nuclear-weapon States to destroy all\r\nstockpiles and arsenals of nuclear weapons, with\r\nacceptable international verification, and thereby rid the\r\nworld of nuclear weapons, once and for all.\r\nMy delegation warmly welcomes the finalization in\r\nOslo last week of a draft treaty prohibiting the\r\ndevelopment, production, acquisition, stockpiling,\r\nretaining or transferring of anti-personnel landmines. We\r\ncall on all nations of the world to sign and ratify the\r\ntreaty.\r\nIn the achievement of all these objectives, whether\r\nthey relate to sustained development or disarmament, the\r\nUnited Nations has a crucial role. It must possess a\r\ndynamism to be effective. It cannot be cumbersome,\r\nunwieldy and partial. To meet new challenges, the United\r\nNations must be streamlined. A meaningful international\r\norganization such as ours must adapt to changes,\r\nenhancing its relevance and competence. The entire\r\ninternational community, including my country, has been\r\ncalling for the reform of the United Nations. It has taken\r\nsome time, but at last our new Secretary-General has\r\npresented his recommendations for a restructured\r\nOrganization that can carry us over the threshold into the\r\nnew millennium. I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive, constructive and coherent\r\nrecommendations.\r\nMy delegation will carefully study the bold and far-\r\nreaching recommendations for reform, and we endorse the\r\nproposals in principle. I make a plea that in the\r\nimplementation of these reforms there must also be\r\npositive benefits for the small Member States, including\r\ntheir increased participation in the United Nations system.\r\nI am particularly pleased that the Secretary-General has\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nidentified economic and social affairs, as well as\r\ndevelopment cooperation, as core activities. His proposals\r\nare congruent with the high priority which my delegation\r\nplaces on economic growth for sustained development. I\r\nhave already stated that the United Nations must play a\r\nconstructive and catalytic role, within its macroeconomic\r\npolicies to facilitate economic growth for sustained\r\ndevelopment, thereby enabling developing countries, which\r\nconstitute the vast majority of the Members of the\r\nOrganization, to have an equal share in the opportunities for\r\nwealth creation.\r\nI fully support the submission that peacekeeping will\r\nremain an indispensable instrument of the United Nations.\r\nMy country, small though it is, has played its part in\r\ninternational peacekeeping programmes in virtually every\r\ntheatre of the world since we joined the United Nations in\r\n1970. In fact, in terms of size of population, Fiji is\r\npresently among the largest troop contributors to United\r\nNations peacekeeping programmes. In the process, several\r\nof our peacekeepers have lost their lives. But as a nation\r\nwe remain committed to the goal of permanent and lasting\r\npeace in our world. I might add here that it is a cause of\r\ngreat pride, but pride tempered with humility, that one of\r\nour nationals, Major-General Jioje Konrote, has been\r\nappointed Force Commander of the United Nations Interim\r\nForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL). It reflects the degree and\r\nextent of the commitment of our small nation of fewer than\r\na million people towards the peace and security of our\r\nworld.\r\nThe proposals for the reform of the United Nations\r\nencompass new management and efficiency measures which\r\nshould reduce administrative costs, but the financial\r\npredicament of our Organization will not be resolved\r\nentirely by cost-cutting measures. It can be resolved if\r\nMember countries pay their contributions promptly. We call\r\non all Member States which are in arrears to settle those\r\narrears promptly, fully and without conditions.\r\nAs we press ahead with the reform of the United\r\nNations, it becomes incumbent on us to ensure that this\r\nextends to the Security Council. My country continues to\r\nadvocate that the Security Council should be expanded to\r\nreflect an equitable geographical distribution, taking into\r\naccount the substantial increase in the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. Reforms affecting the Security Council\r\nshould encompass opportunity for participation in its\r\ndecisions, transparency in its work, a constructive\r\nrelationship with the General Assembly and the limited\r\nscope and use of the veto power.\r\nOn the issue of expansion, my country wishes to\r\nreiterate the recommendation it made to the General\r\nAssembly last November with regard to the membership\r\nof the Security Council, especially its non-permanent\r\nmembership. We strongly favour an equitable and wider\r\nrepresentation of non-permanent members, by which\r\nregions and subregions would adopt a rotation system,\r\nincluding a prohibition on immediate re-election.\r\nI further submit that in the same way that the\r\nCaribbean forms a special subregion of the Latin\r\nAmerican Group, the South Pacific region comprising 14\r\nindependent island States, eight of which are members of\r\nthe United Nations, and Australia and New Zealand,\r\nshould become a special subregion, ensuring continuous\r\nmembership from our region.\r\nThese changes are prerequisites for a dynamic\r\nUnited Nations with credibility in the next millennium.\r\nNow more than ever, our international community\r\nneeds a system of preventive diplomacy that can respond\r\npromptly, positively and peacefully to potential conflicts\r\nand threats of genocide. My country continues to call for\r\na special United Nations division or unit to undertake\r\npreventive diplomacy in conflict prevention and conflict\r\nresolution. The division should have the capacity to\r\nreceive, collate, analyze and interpret intelligence\r\ninformation and reports, with a view to early detection of\r\npotential conflicts and early reaction to minimize, contain\r\nand resolve such conflicts in collaboration with the\r\nrelevant Member States. May I reiterate that in such a\r\ndivision, adequate representation of skills and expertise\r\nfrom small States must be mandatory, for the division\r\nmust not become a device or a creature of the powerful\r\nto impose their will on their own terms.\r\nSpeaking as the head of Government of a small\r\nisland developing country, I totally support the principle\r\nof capacity to pay as a fundamental criterion and a firm\r\nbenchmark on which the contribution of member\r\ncountries to the United Nations should be assessed. My\r\ncountry therefore fully supports the recommendation of\r\nthe Committee on Contributions that the scale of\r\nassessments for all Member States whose share of\r\nadjusted national income is below the current floor rate of\r\n0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of\r\nadjusted income. We also support the recommended\r\nminimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent. We further\r\nurge that the ceiling should not be lowered any further\r\nbecause a reduction will negate the effect of reducing the\r\nrecommended minimum floor rate.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nMy delegation supports the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court. Recent crimes against\r\nhumanity, including genocide, have made it incumbent on\r\nthe international community to take stern action against\r\nthose who perpetrate such heinous acts. It is our sincere\r\nhope that the current efforts by the international community\r\nwill be crowned with success and that come next year we\r\nshall be in a position to adopt a treaty establishing the\r\ninternational criminal court.\r\nMy country strongly emphasizes that the protection\r\nand security of small States should remain a central concern\r\nof the United Nations. Increasingly, elected Governments\r\nand the sovereignty and security of their States are\r\nthreatened by transnational networks of crime, narcotics,\r\nmoney-laundering and terrorism. These scourges are\r\nexpanding, and international cooperation and action are\r\nessential to counter them.\r\nThe Middle East continues to be a cauldron aboil with\r\nconflict, tension, violence and early death, the latter sadly\r\nreaching tragic proportions since last year’s session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We call upon all parties involved to\r\nengage in genuine negotiations towards a just and lasting\r\npeace in the Middle East. We call upon the international\r\ncommunity, too, to contribute towards a just and lasting\r\npeace.\r\nLast year, I commended both the People’s Republic of\r\nChina and Taiwan for their efforts toward reconciling their\r\ndifferences. I wish to renew my plea to them to work\r\ntowards unity. We in Fiji enjoy excellent relations with\r\nboth of them, though we adhere firmly to our One China\r\npolicy. We in the Pacific continue to enjoy their generosity\r\nand their concern for the welfare of the people of the South\r\nPacific. Both the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan\r\nenjoy our friendship and trust. Fiji and the other 15 member\r\ncountries of the South Pacific Forum welcome their\r\nparticipation in the annual post-Forum dialogue and\r\nconsultation with each of them. It is our fervent wish that\r\nthey will, together, find a solution for their common future.\r\nLikewise, I urge South and North Korea to negotiate\r\na solution that will bring lasting peace and unity to the\r\npeople of Korea.\r\nFiji is an oceanic State. As in many island countries,\r\nour progress and development depend as much on our land\r\nterritory as on the sea around us. We are, therefore,\r\nconcerned that the seas are utilized in a manner that is\r\nenvironmentally sound and that the development of marine\r\nresources is orderly and sustainable so that they can serve\r\nthe present and future generations. We insist on this\r\napproach at the national level and strongly support similar\r\nefforts at regional and global levels.\r\nIn the past decade, our region has adopted a number\r\nof treaties and declarations that address the issue of better\r\nmanagement of oceans. More recently, following a\r\ndecision of the heads of Governments of the South Pacific\r\nForum, the region has taken the initiative to negotiate\r\nwith distant-water fishing States the establishment of a\r\nregional fisheries management organization in order to\r\ngive effect to the provisions of the 1982 Convention on\r\nthe Law of the Sea and the Agreement relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks\r\nand Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. This is an important\r\ninitiative which is designed to promote sustainable use of\r\nthe region’s valuable fish resources to the benefit of both\r\nthe coastal States and distant-water fishing nations. We\r\nlook forward to a successful outcome to these\r\nnegotiations.\r\nAs Fiji was the first State to ratify the Convention\r\non the Law of the Sea, in 1982, I feel gratified that,\r\nthanks to the efforts of many, including my own country,\r\nin resolving the outstanding problems, the Convention\r\ntoday enjoys universal support and near universal\r\nparticipation.\r\nAll States benefit from the stability and certainty that\r\nhas been achieved in the new regime of the Law of the\r\nSea. By defining the jurisdiction of States in marine areas,\r\nand by setting out the rights and duties of States, the\r\nConvention represents an important contribution to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe institutions established under the Convention,\r\nnamely the International Seabed Authority and the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, and the\r\nwork being done with respect to the oceans in the United\r\nNations itself, require the support of the international\r\ncommunity if the achievements of the Convention are to\r\nbe consolidated and its promise of benefits to the peoples\r\nof the world is to be realized.\r\nLast year, I lent my strong support to an early\r\nadoption of the draft United Nations declaration of the\r\nrights of indigenous peoples. I renew my call here.\r\nWe are informed in the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme’s Human Development Report 1997 about the\r\nbleak future for indigenous people in almost all societies\r\nwhere they are to be found. It is a great tragedy indeed\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nthat indigenous people have seen their values and customs\r\ndestroyed by incoming population. They face discrimination\r\nin employment and disparities in education and they fare\r\nworse in the non-income dimensions of poverty.\r\nThe observation of the International Decade of the\r\nWorld’s Indigenous People, the programme of activities\r\nassociated with it and the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to prepare a draft United Nations declaration on\r\nthe rights of indigenous peoples, will mean little or nothing\r\nif the indigenous people remain a disadvantaged people in\r\nour world. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for\r\nIndigenous Populations, however meaningful, is a mere\r\ndrop in the ocean of what is required to really facilitate the\r\ndevelopment of the indigenous people. The World Bank\r\nprogramme to assist indigenous people is too limited in\r\nscope and application. The Member States of the United\r\nNations and the international community should do more.\r\nThe survival of the indigenous people is at stake.\r\nMy own country is the home of two indigenous\r\ngroups, Fijians and Rotumans, but it is also the home of\r\nothers who came into our country more recently. These\r\nnewcomers represent nearly half the population of my\r\ncountry. A major challenge for us has been to accommodate\r\nthe interests and aspirations of these citizens and to\r\nreconcile them with the sensibilities, perceptions and\r\npre-eminent status of our indigenous people. We are\r\nensuring peaceful co-existence and cooperation with\r\nsecurity and respect for the fundamental rights of all our\r\ncitizens.\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to address briefly recent\r\ndevelopments in my own country, Fiji, before this\r\nAssembly. Our delegation has kept the Assembly up to date\r\nwith political developments in our country, in particular our\r\nefforts to formulate a new Constitution that is acceptable to\r\nall the ethnic communities in the country. Our current\r\nConstitution, the 1990 Constitution, was promulgated to\r\nsecure adequate representation in Parliament for the\r\nindigenous people in order to guarantee, protect and\r\nenhance their future in their country. That Constitution was\r\nreviewed by a Commission last year. Following the\r\nsubmission of the report of the commission, a Parliamentary\r\nSelect Committee comprising representatives of all the\r\npolitical parties in our Parliament gave due consideration to\r\nthe report and reached a consensus to amend the 1990\r\nConstitution. The changes were written into the Constitution\r\nAmendment Bill of 1997 which was unanimously approved\r\nby the House of Representatives and the Senate and signed\r\ninto law by our President on 25 July 1997. The amended\r\nConstitution comes into effect on 27 July 1998.\r\nI do not intend to provide all of the details of the\r\nnew Constitution, except to say that it contains an\r\nentrenched Bill of Rights guaranteeing and protecting the\r\nequal rights and fundamental freedoms of all individuals\r\nand groups, irrespective of race, religion, gender or\r\neconomic status. In addition to an independent judiciary,\r\ncitizens will also have recourse to an ombudsman and a\r\nhuman rights commission in the protection of their basic\r\nrights. The Constitution continues to enshrine the full\r\nright of self-determination of the indigenous Fijian and\r\nRotuman people, including their right to maintain a\r\nseparate system of administration to safeguard their\r\ninterests and welfare.\r\nA unique feature of the Constitution is the inclusion\r\nof a Compact which recognizes certain principles,\r\nincluding the following: the preservation of the ownership\r\nof land, including the ownership of indigenous Fijian land\r\naccording to Fijian custom; the right of all persons to\r\npractice their religion freely and to retain their language,\r\nculture and tradition; and a commitment by all political\r\nparties and their leaders to cooperate in the formation of\r\na broadly based Government to ensure that the interests\r\nof all communities in Fiji’s multi-ethnic and multi-cultural\r\nsociety are taken fully into account.\r\nIndeed, an innovative feature of our new\r\nConstitution is the provision for the formation of a multi-\r\nparty Government. This is to allow for the representation\r\nin Cabinet of all political parties that secure seats in\r\nParliament through general elections. We have no\r\ndoubt — in fact, we are very confident — that with the\r\ncommitment, goodwill and cooperation of all, this\r\npioneering approach of bringing all communities together\r\nin national decision-making, in government and in\r\nParliament, is the best way of consolidating and\r\npromoting enduring peace, unity and progress in our little\r\ncountry of Fiji. From our ethnic and cultural diversity, we\r\nare determined to build a strong nation with the full\r\nparticipation of all citizens and communities in it.\r\nWe are the world. We who are gathered here\r\nrepresent the Governments and peoples of the world. We\r\nhave it in our power to facilitate economic development\r\nand sustained economic growth that include the full and\r\nequal participation of the developing countries of the\r\nworld. Let us make it an international imperative.\r\nToday I call on all of us to rededicate ourselves\r\nanew to our commitment to the United Nations. Upon the\r\nhigh principles of mutual love, justice and care on which\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nit was established, let us together make our world a better\r\nplace in which to live.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister with Special\r\nResponsibility for the Constitution Review and Minister for\r\nRegional Development and Multi-Ethnic Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Fiji for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Major-General Sitiveni Ligamamada\r\nRabuka, Prime Minister, Minister with Special\r\nResponsibility for the Constitution Review and\r\nMinister for Regional Development and Multi-Ethnic\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Fiji, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: The next speaker inscribed on my list\r\nis His Excellency the Honourable Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation\r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania. He will also speak on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77.\r\nMr. Kikwete (United Republic of Tanzania): Please\r\npermit me, Sir, at the outset, to offer my sincere\r\ncongratulations to you on your election to the Presidency of\r\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. In the\r\nsame vein, our congratulations are directed to the members\r\nof the Bureau on their election. I wish to assure you of the\r\nfull cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of this\r\nheavy responsibility entrusted to you.\r\nI would also like to express my thanks to Ambassador\r\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia for the able manner in which he\r\ndischarged his responsibilities during his Presidency of the\r\nlast session. At this juncture, I would like to pay a special\r\ntribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his deserved election as\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and for the able\r\nmanner in which he is carrying out his responsibilities.\r\nLooking at the agenda of this meeting, it is an historic\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly and you, Sir, will be\r\nremembered for many years to come. Personally, I feel\r\nproud and privileged to be associated with this meeting.\r\nLast year, here in New York, members of the Group\r\nof 77 and China elected my country, Tanzania, to the\r\nchairmanship of the Group. The last nine months or so in\r\nthat post have been a very exciting and challenging\r\nexperience for me and my colleagues at our Mission to the\r\nUnited Nations and for the entire Government of the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania. We have been involved in several\r\nmeetings, debates and negotiations on behalf of the Group.\r\nI am glad to say that, despite some setbacks, notable\r\nsuccess and progress have been made in all our\r\nendeavours. All this was made possible through the\r\ncooperation, support and, above all, teamwork of all\r\nmembers of the Group. We thank all members for their\r\nsupport.\r\n(Mr. Elaraby (Egypt), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.)\r\nTwo years ago, world leaders met here to celebrate\r\n50 years of the existence of the United Nations. Besides\r\ntaking stock of the progress made and the lessons learned,\r\nthe Heads of State or Government endeavoured to chart\r\nthe institutional framework and operational parameters\r\nthat could enhance the Organization’s relevance and\r\neffectiveness in a changed international environment. In\r\nthis context, apart from the Organization’s traditional\r\nroles of maintaining international peace and security and\r\nproviding humanitarian assistance, it was also found\r\nessential to place development cooperation issues at the\r\ncentre of United Nations activities. The United Nations\r\nitself needed to undertake appropriate reform measures so\r\nthat it would be better able to deal with the challenges of\r\nthe new global economy.\r\nTo facilitate the reform process in the socio-\r\neconomic field, developing countries participated actively\r\nand effectively in work on the Agenda for Development\r\nto ensure the successful conclusion of the negotiations of\r\nthis important process. These negotiations were completed\r\nin June 1997, and I should like to commend the Ad Hoc\r\nOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on\r\nthis issue for its good work.\r\nBuilding on the outcome of recent United Nations\r\nconferences and other relevant agreements, the Agenda\r\nfor Development underscores that sustained economic\r\ngrowth is essential to the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of all countries, in particular developing\r\ncountries. While acknowledging the importance of\r\nnational policies and measures in the development\r\nprocess, the Agenda for Development calls for action\r\ntowards a dynamic and enabling international economic\r\nenvironment, including such aspects as an open, rule-\r\nbased, equitable, secure, non-discriminatory, transparent\r\nand predictable multilateral trading system and the\r\npromotion of investment and the transfer of technology\r\nand knowledge. Additionally, the Agenda calls for\r\nenhanced international cooperation in the mobilization and\r\nprovision of financial resources for development. It also\r\nunderscores the need for an effective, equitable,\r\ndevelopment-oriented and durable solution to the external\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\ndebt and debt-servicing problems of the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nMany developing countries are not able to benefit\r\nfrom the twin processes of the liberalization and the\r\nglobalization of the world economy. These processes\r\nbenefit some countries while causing instability and\r\nmarginalization in others, particularly in developing\r\ncountries. The least-developed countries face the greatest\r\nrisk of further marginalization. This is why they continue\r\nto demand that such uneven trends be addressed, and that\r\nthe World Trade Organization and other related\r\ninternational organizations adopt specific and concrete\r\nmeasures to mitigate the adverse effects arising from the\r\nimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements. These\r\nmeasures must include long-term financial and technical\r\nsupport, the transfer of technology, and the improvement of\r\nthe trade performance of the developing countries. It is also\r\nnecessary to ensure full and effective participation of the\r\ndeveloping countries in the international economic decision-\r\nmaking processes.\r\nConcerning financial flows, it is imperative to reverse\r\nthe overall decline in official development assistance and to\r\nachieve the agreed target of 0.7 per cent by the turn of the\r\ncentury. We appeal to developed countries to reaffirm their\r\ncommitments to meet this target. Other sources of\r\nconcessional external financial assistance should also be\r\nstrengthened to enable them without conditionalities to\r\nincrease resources for disbursement in support of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn addition to official development assistance and\r\nmultilateral assistance, the growth in foreign direct\r\ninvestment in developing countries is of particular\r\nimportance. However, foreign direct investment portfolio\r\nflows are going to very few developing countries, those\r\nwhich are already growing fast; very little, or none, is\r\ngoing to the least-developed countries. For example, Africa\r\nhas received only a small proportion of the total net private\r\nflows, despite extensive reforms that continue to be\r\nundertaken. The challenge to the international community\r\nin this respect is to ensure that adequate capital and\r\ninvestment flows also reach the least-developed countries so\r\nas to accelerate their pace of development. This could be\r\ndone through, inter alia, the improvement of economic and\r\nsocial infrastructure in the least-developed countries.\r\nExternal indebtedness is one of the major obstacles to\r\nthe development efforts of many developing countries. It is\r\nacknowledged that even with sound economic policies and\r\nwith full appreciation of the debt-rescheduling arrangements\r\nin place, developing countries continue to face an\r\nunbearable debt-servicing burden. There is hence an\r\nurgent need for adopting durable solutions to external\r\ndebt and debt-servicing problems, particularly those of the\r\nheavily indebted poor countries. More also needs to be\r\ndone in terms of debt stock cancellation and forgiveness.\r\nWe appreciate recent initiatives to reduce debts, both\r\nthose within the Naples terms of the Paris Club, and those\r\nwithin the multilateral framework, such as the heavily\r\nindebted poor countries initiative of the World Bank and\r\nthe International Monetary Fund. However, the criteria for\r\neligibility should be more flexible to enable more\r\ncountries to benefit from these arrangements. As it is\r\nnow, it is almost a nightmare for a country to qualify in\r\nterms of conditionalities involved and the time it takes\r\nbefore reaping the first benefits after qualifying. It is like\r\nbeing so near yet so far.\r\nThe debate on development is closely interlinked\r\nwith that on the environment. In June this year, a special\r\nsession of the Assembly was held to review and appraise\r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21 five years on. It is\r\nregrettable that the special session came out with no\r\nconcrete agreement or commitments on the cross-cutting\r\nissues of financial resources and technology transfer. For\r\nwhile it was possible to agree on follow-up action on\r\nsome of the sectoral issues such as forests, energy,\r\nclimate change, desertification, fresh water and others,\r\nlack of concrete agreement on issues related to financial\r\nresources and technology transfer militates against\r\neffective realization of the little that was agreed upon.\r\nIn his statement at the special session on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China, my President, His Excellency\r\nMr. Benjamin William Mkapa, emphasized that all\r\ncountries should rededicate themselves to the Rio\r\nDeclaration in order to achieve the goals of sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development. He further\r\nstressed the need for creating a more conducive\r\ninternational economic environment, to enable developing\r\ncountries to gain access to new and additional resources\r\nand technology on concessional and grant terms. I wish\r\nto reiterate that call today.\r\nOther major international conferences and world\r\nsummits held since 1990 will also come up for review in\r\nthe near future. It is our hope that a new spirit of\r\ninternational partnership in resolving the various socio-\r\neconomic problems facing, particularly, developing\r\ncountries will emerge and that international support for\r\nthe implementation of the various programmes of these\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nconferences will continue to be provided by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn recent years, South-South cooperation has evolved\r\ninto an important modality for addressing the development\r\nneeds of developing countries. We are convinced that\r\nSouth-South cooperation provides a sound basis for\r\npromoting economic growth and increasing technical\r\ncapacities for acceleration of development in the developing\r\ncountries. The Group of 77 and China pledge to intensify\r\nexisting cooperation and solidarity among its members with\r\na view to sharing development experiences and solving\r\nsome of the development problems facing them.\r\nI agree with the Secretary-General that reform of the\r\nUnited Nations is not an event but a process. General\r\nAssembly resolution 50/227 and the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals provide a basis for the discussion of United\r\nNations reforms. However, we strongly feel that emphasis\r\nshould be placed on the overall policy thrust and mission of\r\nthe Organization geared towards the strengthening of its\r\neconomic role.\r\nFurthermore, institutions that deal with economic\r\nissues, such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO) and the relevant\r\nEconomic and Social Council bodies and regional\r\ncommissions, should remain. They should also be\r\nstrengthened to ensure that the development concerns of\r\ndeveloping countries are taken fully into account.\r\nAs for the reform of the Security Council, my country\r\nstands for more democratization and equity in this crucial\r\norgan of the United Nations. We stand for the expansion of\r\nits membership in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories, with the additional members in the permanent\r\ncategory getting veto power. The expansion in both\r\ncategories should include not only Japan and Germany, but\r\nalso equitable representation of the developing countries of\r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America.\r\nAll reforms must be conducive to realizing the broad\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter and to improving the\r\nefficiency of the United Nations in all areas. They must\r\nalso contribute to a more positive and effective United\r\nNations role in promoting world peace and development,\r\nand meet the aspirations of developing countries. I am\r\nconfident that we will be able to achieve a broad consensus\r\nas long as all of us engage in deliberations in good faith\r\nand with a readiness to consider all legitimate concerns.\r\nTanzania appreciates the changes that have taken\r\nplace in the area of disarmament. The threat of nuclear\r\nwar may not at present manifest itself in the ideological\r\nconfrontation of the past, but it has not gone away or\r\nreceded. It is still with us, and we should guard against\r\nany complacency that we are any safer today. Nations\r\nstill possess nuclear warheads, and new generations of\r\nthese weapons are being manufactured. The total\r\nelimination of these weapons must continue to be the\r\ncentral purpose of our disarmament agenda.\r\nWhile nuclear weapons still pose a potentially grave\r\nthreat to international peace and security, conventional\r\nones have had a devastating effect, particularly in areas of\r\nconflict. Among these are anti-personnel landmines,\r\nwhich maim and kill the innocent, even long after war\r\nhas ended. The effects of these weapons are evident all\r\nover the world, with their most violent manifestation in\r\ncountries such as Angola, Cambodia, Mozambique and\r\nBosnia. Tanzania has supported, and will continue to\r\nsupport, a worldwide ban of these weapons through the\r\nframework of the Ottawa process and looks forward to\r\nbecoming an effective party to the instrument just\r\nconcluded in Oslo, Norway. At the same time, we hope\r\nthat the elimination of anti-personnel landmines will not\r\nbe seen as an end in itself, but as part of the overall\r\nobjective of eliminating other weapons, especially\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nAs the United Nations grapples with the challenges\r\nof peace and development, it is still faced with many\r\npolitical problems which need urgent resolution if\r\nhumanity is to prosper. From Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean to Europe, from Asia to the Middle East and\r\nAfrica, the United Nations is faced with the arduous task\r\nof promoting peace, democracy and good governance as\r\nthe enduring pillars of development.\r\nWe congratulate the people of Liberia for having\r\nconducted a successful democratic election, which, we\r\nhope, has ushered in a new era of peace in that country.\r\nNow, as they seek to regain their footing and begin the\r\narduous task of national reconciliation, healing and\r\neconomic reconstruction, they will need the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAt a time when Liberia is emerging from destruction\r\nand suffering, we are deeply concerned that Sierra Leone\r\nis sinking deeper into chaos at the expense of peace,\r\ndevelopment and democracy for that country. The\r\nGovernment of Tanzania has associated itself fully with\r\nthe efforts made within the framework of the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to restore\r\ndemocracy and constitutional rule in Sierra Leone. Even at\r\nthis late hour, we continue to hope that the Sierra Leonean\r\nmilitary will realize the folly of their misadventure and\r\nagree to return their country to constitutional rule. In the\r\nmeantime, the continuing efforts of the West African\r\nregion, and Africa in general, merit expanded support so as\r\nto put an end to the destructive cycle of military coups in\r\nSierra Leone.\r\nIn Angola, we continue to be concerned by the\r\nmanoeuvres of UNITA to stall the process of\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka accords. Our concern is given\r\nadded urgency by the steady degeneration of the situation\r\nin the country and the likelihood of a return to open\r\nhostilities and war, with all the destruction and suffering\r\nthat portends for the people of that country. We urge\r\nUNITA to abandon its obstructionist policies and abide by\r\nthe Lusaka peace accords. We hope the United Nations will\r\nremain engaged in Angola.\r\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region remains\r\nprecarious. The consequences of decades of misrule in\r\nsome countries of the region have been horrendous in terms\r\nof suffering, war, death and lost opportunities to harness its\r\ngreat development potential. We regret that the situation in\r\nBurundi shows no sign of improvement. The military\r\nauthorities have persisted in frustrating the efforts of the\r\nregion within the framework of the Arusha initiative, under\r\nthe chairmanship of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, to facilitate\r\nthe process of political dialogue.\r\nTanzania and the other countries of the region are\r\npersisting in their efforts because we believe there is no\r\nalternative to dialogue but war and more suffering for\r\ninnocent civilians. The region has no other interest in\r\nBurundi but to help. At the regional level, meetings were\r\nheld in Arusha on 4 September, and the leaders reiterated\r\ntheir commitment to the search for peace in Burundi and\r\ncalled upon the military authorities there to abandon the\r\ncourse of confrontation and seek dialogue and political\r\naccommodation with all elements in Burundi.\r\nThe region has been categorical in restating that the\r\nBurundi authorities should be under no illusion that they\r\ncan bury their heads in the sand or wish the problem away.\r\nThey simply have to face reality and dutifully rise to the\r\noccasion. Certainly the region and the international\r\ncommunity cannot leave them alone and allow them to lead\r\nthe country into self-destruction and war, with all the\r\nattendant problems that creates for Burundi and its\r\nneighbours. I wish to appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to continue assisting the region so that our\r\ngoal of restarting the dialogue for peace in the country is\r\nachieved.\r\nIn Rwanda, fortunately, the situation is steadily\r\nstabilizing, particularly after the return of most of its\r\ncitizens, who had been coerced into a drifting life in exile\r\nas refugees. Yet the difficulties which face that country\r\nare enormous. The process of recovery from the immense\r\nmoral, physical and spiritual effects of the 1994 genocide\r\nwill be painful and slow. As Rwanda struggles to come\r\nto terms with the genocide, reconcile with itself and\r\ncontinue on the path of national healing and renewal, it\r\nneeds our solidarity and support.\r\nWith President Laurent Kabila’s assumption of the\r\nleadership of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\r\nprocess of returning to democratic rule has begun, albeit\r\nslowly. We realize that it will not be an easy or swift\r\nprocess, given the political rigidity and the policies of\r\npolitical exclusion to which that country was subjected for\r\ndecades. We appreciate the enormity of the task of\r\nputting the country back on its feet, restoring Government\r\ninstitutions and setting out towards democratic recovery.\r\nGiven this background, what the Government and people\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo need most is\r\nsolidarity, understanding and material support from the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe political problems of the Great Lakes have\r\nprecipitated a grave humanitarian challenge as millions of\r\npeople have been forced into a life of exile as refugees.\r\nThis has placed an enormous burden on the countries of\r\nthe region, including my own, which has had to shoulder\r\nit without commensurate resources. We appreciate the\r\ngreat work done by United Nations agencies and many\r\nhumanitarian non-governmental organizations in terms of\r\nproviding the much-needed assistance to the refugees.\r\nIndeed, without this support, the life of the refugees\r\nwould have been most unbearable. Yet even with this\r\nmuch-appreciated assistance, the burden left to refugee-\r\nreceiving States has been enormous. The economic,\r\nsocial, environmental and security consequences of\r\nhosting the refugees will have long-lasting effects from\r\nwhich these countries will continue to suffer even after\r\nthe repatriation of the refugees has been completed. This\r\nraises the fundamental issue of assisting the asylum\r\ncountries, not only to cope with the immediate task of\r\nmeeting the needs of the refugees, but also with the long-\r\nterm effects of hosting them. This aspect needs\r\naddressing.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nSomalia may no longer be on our television screens or\r\nworthy of the news headlines, but it is still a problem\r\nwhich must not be forgotten. The country is still\r\nfragmented, and fighting among the factions in conflict is\r\nnot yet over. There is a chance that through the Sodere\r\ninitiative there may be some positive developments. The\r\nUnited Nations needs to continue associating itself closely\r\nwith the efforts being expended by the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority for Drought and Development and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity aimed at bringing durable\r\npeace to Somalia.\r\nIn Western Sahara, too, we are concerned by the\r\napparent freeze in the implementation of the settlement\r\nplan. As we reiterate our solidarity with the Frente\r\nPOLISARIO, we express the hope that the initiatives of the\r\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General, in the person of the\r\nformer United States Secretary of State James Baker, will\r\nbear fruit and remove the prevailing political difficulties in\r\nthe implementation of the settlement plan.\r\nTanzania continues to follow closely the developments\r\nin the Middle East which now threaten peace in the area. In\r\nthis regard, Tanzania reiterates its solidarity with the\r\nPalestinian people and calls upon the Palestinian and the\r\nIsraeli authorities to persist in their efforts to consolidate\r\ndialogue and move forward in elaborating permanent\r\narrangements for peace. We still believe that, ultimately,\r\nenduring peace in the region lies in the return of all the\r\noccupied Arab land and in the full enjoyment by the\r\nPalestinian people of its inalienable right to self-\r\ndetermination and independence, including the\r\nestablishment of a homeland for themselves within\r\ninternationally recognized boundaries.\r\nIn conclusion, as we move into the new millennium,\r\nthe world is still a place largely besieged by poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment, conflict and war. The giant leaps of\r\nscience and technology which have enabled humankind to\r\nexplore outer space and to shrink the world into a global\r\nvillage have so far not been adequately and evenly\r\nchannelled into meeting the compelling needs of the greater\r\npart humanity. The world will transit into the next\r\nmillennium divided between those who are prosperous and\r\nat peace and those living in abject poverty and at war.\r\nTherefore, it must be the overriding objective of the United\r\nNations to ensure that this disparity is overcome. The\r\nchallenge that we must all face is to strengthen this\r\nOrganization by unconditionally supporting it fully,\r\npolitically and financially to enable it to serve humanity\r\nbetter.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. José Miguel Insulza.\r\nMr. Insulza (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIt is with particular pleasure that I extend to you, Mr.\r\nPresident, my sincerest congratulations, and those of my\r\nGovernment, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly. Your election will ensure that the business of\r\nthe General Assembly will be conducted skilfully,\r\nimpartially and very efficiently at this important moment\r\nfor the General Assembly, when it will have to make\r\ndecisions that may be vital to the future of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe General Assembly session that we are now\r\nbeginning is a particularly important one in that its\r\npurpose is to ensure that in the future multilateral activity\r\nwill be assured of validity, effectiveness and credibility.\r\nWith the United Nations having completed more than 50\r\nyears of existence, we need new ways to view the world,\r\nwithout forgetting the many achievements made and the\r\nvaluable experience gained both from successes and from\r\nfailures.\r\nThis is an appropriate time for us to renew our\r\ncommitment to multilateralism as the guiding principle of\r\ninternational relations and the essential tool to resolve\r\ncrises and problems that are beyond the ability of any\r\nState, however important or powerful it may be, to\r\nresolve on its own.\r\nThis is particularly important in the face of a\r\ngrowing unilateralism that has recently emerged as a\r\nfeature of the international scene. The new international\r\nreality makes it essential for States to act together so as\r\nto confront energetically and resolutely the problems of\r\nthe environment, organized crime, arms control, human\r\nrights, democratization, poverty, unemployment, social\r\nfragmentation and many other issues.\r\nChile has consistently contributed to the\r\nOrganization and, to the limits of its ability to do so, will\r\ncontinue to lend its strong support to the great work of\r\nthe United Nations in all its forums.\r\nI wish to speak first of the issue of the Security\r\nCouncil and its reform process. I stressed before the\r\nGeneral Assembly last year the importance of greater\r\ninvolvement by Member States in the decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council in order to strengthen its legitimacy and\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\ngive it the necessary political backing for the actions it\r\nundertakes.\r\nWe reiterate once again the desirability of revising the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council and its working\r\nmethods. In this connection, we appreciate the arduous\r\nwork conducted by the Working Group on this issue, which\r\nhas served to clarify the various positions and to allow a\r\nproper appraisal of this enormously complex subject.\r\nI wish especially to pay tribute to the outgoing\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Razali Ismail of\r\nMalaysia, for his keen sense of responsibility and his\r\ncourage in taking the initiative to make specific proposals\r\non these matters in order to ease the difficulties\r\nencountered within the Working Group and make it\r\npossible to analyse and discuss them in specific terms.\r\nMy Government considers that any future composition\r\nof the Council must combine the requirements of its\r\neffectiveness with the need for an equitable representation\r\nof the developing countries that properly reflects the\r\nincrease in the number of Members in the past 50 years.\r\nWhere these fundamental issues are concerned, Chile\r\nsupports and endorses the content of the Declaration on the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council issued by the Heads of State or\r\nGovernment at the eleventh summit of the Rio Group in\r\nAsunción, Paraguay, on 24 August of this year.\r\nIn that Declaration we expressed the great importance\r\nwe attach to the process of expanding and reforming the\r\nSecurity Council, which must result in a broad general\r\nagreement that will make it possible to correct the\r\nimbalances in its current composition, improve the decision-\r\nmaking mechanisms, make the conduct of its work more\r\ntransparent and represent with greater legitimacy all States\r\nMembers of the Organization.\r\nWith regard to the total number of members of the\r\nSecurity Council, we believe that a membership of up to 25\r\nwould not impair its effectiveness, provided that the\r\nexpansion met the requirements of responding properly to\r\nthe increase in United Nations Member States since the last\r\nreform of the Charter and the undeniably growing\r\nimportance of developing countries.\r\nChile shares in the broad base of agreement on\r\nallowing the entry of Germany and Japan as permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. Nevertheless, there is\r\nalso a conviction that this can take place only in the context\r\nof suitable regional representation, including other\r\npermanent members from Asia, Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica.\r\nWe support a process of regional consultation and\r\nconsensus to fill these seats. This, however, does not\r\nexclude a possible role for the General Assembly in case\r\nthere is an absence of regional agreement. In this\r\nconnection, the Assembly will have to analyse carefully\r\nthe proposals that have been put forward regarding\r\nrotation. These are undoubtedly attractive since they\r\ninclude a larger number of countries, but they could\r\nimpair the effectiveness of the Council and increase\r\ntensions between permanent and non-permanent members.\r\nAs far as the Latin American and Caribbean region\r\nis concerned, its fundamental responsibility is to fill its\r\nseats through a process that gives its members legal\r\nvalidity and political legitimacy. In this process,\r\nconsideration must be given to all the possibilities that\r\nwill allow for appropriate regional representation. Chile\r\nis prepared to accept any formula that reflects this.\r\nSerious consideration must be given to the possibility that\r\nonly one of its members will occupy the permanent seat\r\nallocated to the region.\r\nThe question of the veto will also have to be\r\ndiscussed in greater depth, taking into account many\r\nfactors, such as legal ones relating to Charter obligations\r\nand the evolution of modern international law, and\r\npolitical ones, such as the evolution of the international\r\nsituation, which are today very different from those\r\nprevailing at the time the United Nations came into being.\r\nThe outgoing President of the General Assembly has\r\nmade some very interesting proposals in this regard,\r\nwhich need to be carefully considered by Member States.\r\nChile is concluding this year, with a sense of\r\nsatisfaction, its participation in the Security Council after\r\nan absence of more than 30 years. Our decision to\r\nparticipate was motivated by the need to assume our\r\ninternational responsibilities, and we did so in the\r\nconviction that we could make a contribution.\r\nAs a preliminary conclusion, I would like to\r\nemphasize that the rich contribution of the non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Council provides genuine balance and\r\nenables the Council to renew itself over time. Our\r\nexperience has been a rewarding one, and we have sought\r\nto focus our contribution, beyond our natural interest in\r\nissues relating to the Latin American region, on a number\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nof areas in which welcome progress has been made, to\r\nwhich Chile has made an effective contribution.\r\nWe welcome the important progress the Council has\r\nmade regarding its responsibility in the humanitarian\r\nsphere, which has necessarily become a major aspect of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This is the\r\nfoundation of the presidential statement issued by the\r\nCouncil on the protection of humanitarian workers. The\r\nstrengthening of this aspect of the Council’s work was one\r\nof the main issues in which Chile participated. Motivated\r\nby our concern about this matter, we proposed a mechanism\r\nthat establishes the modalities by which the Council\r\ncommunicates with the humanitarian agencies working in\r\nthe field.\r\nSimilarly, Chile has been particularly concerned that\r\ncountries that have experienced severe conflicts should not\r\nbe abandoned by the system once conflict ends. We have\r\ntherefore insisted on the need for a United Nations presence\r\nin the field when peace-building gives way to overall\r\nreconstruction and development activities.\r\nWith respect to sanctions, it has been demonstrated\r\nthat, where authoritarian Governments are concerned, broad\r\nsanction regimes merely penalize the population without\r\nbringing about political change. We have noted the progress\r\nmade by the Council in devising sanctions, as in the case\r\nof resolution 1072 (1996) on the situation in Burundi and\r\nthe one recently adopted on UNITA in Angola, which are\r\nindeed capable of yielding the desired results without\r\nharming innocent populations.\r\nLastly, Chile has attached special importance to\r\nAfrican affairs while a member of the Security Council. We\r\nbelieved it important to assist the Council in taking\r\ndecisions on the problems that region is facing at this\r\nhistoric moment when African countries are assuming their\r\nown responsibilities for regional problems, as has been\r\napparent in the Organization of African Unity initiative in\r\nthe Arusha process and the activities of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States, among others.\r\nWe are aware that the reform process is not confined\r\nto the Security Council. The Secretary-General has told us\r\nclearly and lucidly that we are facing the most extensive\r\nand farthest-reaching reforms in the 52 years of this\r\nOrganization’s history. Accordingly, we welcome his\r\ncomprehensive report of last July, entitled, “Renewing the\r\nUnited Nations: A programme for reform”. We agree with\r\nhis proposals aimed at transforming the leadership and\r\nmanagement structure of the United Nations so as to enable\r\nit to act with greater unity of purpose, coherence and\r\nagility in tackling the problems.\r\nWe wish to convey to the Secretary-General and his\r\ncolleagues our gratitude for the report, which the General\r\nAssembly will have to analyse in depth, and Chile will\r\ncontribute to the debate with interest and dedication and\r\nin an open spirit of consensus.\r\nIn this connection, we agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s statement that the major source of institutional\r\nweakness in the United Nations is the fact that over the\r\ncourse of the past half century certain of its organizational\r\nfeatures have tended to become fragmented, duplicated\r\nand rigid, resulting in their ineffectiveness in some areas\r\nand superfluity in others. As Chile sees it, the main\r\nobstacle to the reform process has been the fear of change\r\nthat exists in the Organization, which has paralysed the\r\nprocess since it began here in the General Assembly four\r\nyears ago. The time has come for all of us, the Secretariat\r\nand Member States alike, to show proudly our collective\r\ncreativity, courage and realistic inventiveness. The period\r\nof bureaucratization in the United Nations must give way\r\nto the era of creation.\r\nOnly through flexible and efficient management will\r\nwe be able to give new impetus to the Organization and\r\nprovide it with the proper tools for the true modernization\r\nthe international community demands. Reform is not\r\nintrinsically an exercise in cutting costs or reducing staff.\r\nIts aim is to ensure a real and growing increase in the\r\npolitical effectiveness of the United Nations, from the\r\nSecurity Council and the way it deals with and resolves\r\npresent-day conflicts in today’s world to the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the development agencies.\r\nMany of the problems facing the Organization result\r\nfrom the fact that Member States have been remiss in\r\nresponding to the need to adapt intergovernmental\r\nmachinery to the new requirements of the international\r\nsituation. This is perhaps one of the main aspects of the\r\nreform process we have embarked upon.\r\nAccordingly, it is essential to proceed further with\r\nthe reorientation and restructuring of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council in order to coordinate both the agencies\r\nand its subsidiary bodies so that it may engage in\r\nexecutive interaction with the functions of the General\r\nAssembly. In that way, it can regain its leadership\r\nposition as a flexible and efficient organ and contribute\r\neffectively to answering the challenges on the economic\r\nand social agenda of the Organization.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nGiven this mandate of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, its future relationship with the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund will be extremely important.\r\nIn this connection, the establishment of a substantive\r\nsecretariat of the Economic and Social Council seems to us\r\nan interesting proposal.\r\nFurthermore, the reform process should leave room for\r\nthe progressive regionalization that is taking place within\r\nthe United Nations system. In the review of the regional\r\ncommissions to be carried out by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, there is a need to find mechanisms which, without\r\naffecting the regional mandates of each commission, can\r\ncontribute to the definition and regional implementation of\r\nthe major agreements and consensuses reached by the major\r\nconferences sponsored by the United Nations system over\r\nthe past decade.\r\nWe are following with interest the proposal to give to\r\nthe Resident Coordinator of the Secretary-General authority\r\nover all United Nations bodies in the field. This new\r\nintegrated approach, in which the funds and programmes\r\nwill retain their autonomy, will contribute to the necessary\r\ncohesion and reduce the natural tendency towards\r\ndivergence between the multidisciplinary agencies\r\nrepresented, thereby strengthening their activities.\r\nIt also seems to us essential to evaluate the subsidiary\r\nbodies in greater depth, using as the main criteria their\r\nrelevance and effectiveness, and to take the appropriate\r\ndecisions. Accordingly, we are concerned by the\r\nrecommendation to merge the Commissions on Narcotic\r\nDrugs and on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, since\r\nthat would run the risk of limiting treatment of the problem\r\nof narcotic drugs merely to its criminal dimension, losing\r\nsight, in the process, of elements that are an inherent part\r\nof the drug issue, such as education and prevention. At the\r\nsame time, the reform process must assign special\r\nimportance to measures and mechanisms designed to\r\naccelerate economic and social development, especially in\r\nAfrica, by supporting domestic efforts at economic\r\nrestructuring, diversification of raw materials and increased\r\nfood security being carried out by the countries of the\r\nregion.\r\nWe welcome the proposals designed to strengthen the\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, both\r\ninstitutionally and substantively, since they seem to us to be\r\nof great importance for the future development of the\r\nOrganization. The protection and promotion of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, together with democracy\r\nand equitable growth, are the three pillars of present-day\r\ninternational society. As the Secretary-General himself\r\nhas stated, they constitute an essential component of\r\ninternational peace and security. Any measure that\r\ncontributes to strengthening the ability of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights to take action will\r\nreceive the firm support of the Chilean delegation.\r\nSimilarly, we strongly support the initiatives by the\r\nSecretary-General with regard to the proposals for\r\ninteraction between civil society and private enterprise,\r\nwhich have become major actors at both the national and\r\ninternational levels. The time has come for civil society,\r\nincluding the business community, to participate in the\r\nUnited Nations at a level that reflects the contribution that\r\nit has been making for some time.\r\nA series of measures have been recommended to us\r\nthat are designed to make more flexible the procedures\r\nfor deliberations in the General Assembly, to reduce the\r\nlength of meetings, apply a thematic approach to topical\r\nissues, overcome delays and enable us to concentrate on\r\nthe most essential matters. While technically these\r\nproposals appear to relate more to formal than to\r\nsubstantive aspects, we know that in fact they will not be\r\nsimple or merely procedural decisions. In reality, their\r\naim is to promote the capacity of this Organization to\r\nbuild consensus, so as to arrive at concise decisions in the\r\nshortest possible time.\r\nOn financial matters, we endorse the proposal for\r\nresults-based budgeting, with few institutional\r\nmechanisms having a major strategic impact. This seems\r\nto us an innovation will have far-reaching consequences\r\nfor the Organization. We also support the idea of\r\nreallocating savings to economic and social activities\r\nthrough the establishment of a development account.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nWe have focused our statement on the great task of\r\nreform, which is difficult, complex and full of potential as\r\nwell as of problems. We are determined to find the\r\nsolutions that the United Nations requires if it is to\r\ndischarge all its mandates and satisfy the demands and\r\naspirations of an international community that is anxious to\r\nplace in the Organization great hopes for the future. We are\r\ndetermined not to let this opportunity to restructure and\r\nrenew the United Nations pass us by. The full cooperation\r\nof the Chilean delegation can be counted on in this effort.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n29\r\n"
