(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo, President of\r\nthe Republic of Nicaragua\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of Nicaragua, His Excellency Mr. Arnoldo\r\nAlemán Lacayo, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Lacayo (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nwould like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-second\r\nsession.\r\nIt is a principle of today’s world that political\r\nlegitimacy and democracy constitute the most civilized form\r\nof government. The United Nations must reflect this\r\nincreasingly universal principle by supporting the efforts\r\nbeing made by the Governments and peoples of the world\r\nthat are struggling to democratize their countries.\r\nAfter a decade of totalitarianism and struggles of\r\nresistance, the Nicaraguan people have chosen democracy\r\nas our system of government. Proof of this is the elections\r\nthat were successfully conducted in 1990 and in 1996,\r\nwhen I was elected President of Nicaragua and undertook\r\nto build a state of law and to lead my country along the\r\npath of democracy, reconciliation with justice and the\r\ninstitutionalization of the State.\r\nWe know that this is a difficult challenge. The\r\nGovernment over which I preside has made the\r\ncommitment to achieve economic and social development\r\nthat will make it possible to meet the basic needs of the\r\npopulation and to guarantee sustainable growth in the\r\nmedium and long term.\r\nWe are aware of the need to promote a national\r\ncommitment to democracy. To that end we have initiated\r\nan open, sincere national dialogue with different sectors\r\nof society, including the political parties, civil society and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, so that together we can\r\nfind the key elements for building a democratic political\r\nculture.\r\nMy Government is pleased to support the\r\nhemisphere’s efforts, as coordinator of item 18 on the\r\nagenda of the Summit of the Americas, “Strengthening of\r\nthe role of women in society”. The Summit meeting\r\nwished to emphasize that the exclusion of women from\r\nthe tasks and benefits of development is a big obstacle to\r\nthe attainment of growth and democracy.\r\nThe entire world is in a process of change, and we\r\nbelieve that the United Nations system cannot remain on\r\nthe sidelines. Nicaragua congratulates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nGeneral on his dynamic vision, and we thank him for his\r\nreport entitled “Renewing the United Nations: A\r\nProgramme for Reform” (A/51/950).\r\nNicaragua has benefited from many programmes of\r\nthe system and its agencies, programmes which have had an\r\nimpact on its economy, health, social well-being, education\r\nand employment, to name just a few areas, and ultimately\r\non democratic development.\r\nMy Government considers the time has come for\r\nMember States to approve a greater leadership role for the\r\nSecretary-General. We are glad that the Secretary-General\r\nattaches special importance to peace processes and the need\r\nto improve the system’s capacity to combat drug trafficking\r\nand terrorism. We support programmes to reduce arms and\r\nenhance human rights, as well as to strengthen the ability\r\nto respond in the best possible way to emergency situations.\r\nLikewise, my Government considers that development\r\nprogrammes and programmes for strengthening democratic\r\nsystems must not be affected. Our democracies still have\r\nenemies. A rapid response capacity is essential today.\r\nThe Security Council’s present structure and its\r\nMembers’ prerogatives belong to a bygone era. The days of\r\nthe cold war and a bipolar world are a thing of the past,\r\nand the number of States making up the international\r\ncommunity has increased substantially since 1965, the date\r\nof the last enlargement of the Council. It is therefore clear\r\nthat its present structure is neither equitable nor democratic.\r\nThe days of armed conflict in the Central American\r\nregion are over. In this very forum, all the nations of the\r\nworld have declared Central America to be a region of\r\npeace, democracy and development. Fortunately, we Central\r\nAmericans are daily getting closer to real and effective\r\nintegration.\r\nWe are aware of the urgent need to bring about\r\nprofound change in our institutional system in such a way\r\nas to respect our sovereignty, and laws, and the different\r\ncharacteristics of each nation, while allowing us to face\r\neffectively the challenges of the next century and to blend\r\nsuccessfully into global flows of trade and investment.\r\nDeeply resolved, the Central American Presidents have\r\nagreed to initiate a process of gradually establishing the\r\nCentral American union. To that effect, we announced in\r\nManagua on 2 September the decision to designate a high-\r\nlevel group to prepare the bases and the conditions for\r\nconstituting the union. We ask the international community\r\nto support this process unreservedly, for we consider it\r\ninvaluable for the strengthening of our democracy and the\r\nwell-being of our peoples.\r\nWe Central Americans do not want the destructive\r\nconsequences of war experienced in the 1980s to continue\r\ninto the twenty-first century. We still face humanitarian\r\nand economic problems because of the damage caused by\r\nthe presence of landmines and other explosive devices,\r\nwhich have caused irreparable losses to the civilian\r\npopulation and the national economy.\r\nThe United Nations has seen profound changes in\r\nworld events, including great transformations in Eastern\r\nEurope and the former Soviet Union. We are pleased to\r\nsee how democracy, the ideas of civil society and respect\r\nfor fundamental human rights are becoming predominant\r\ncharacteristics of today’s world.\r\nI therefore note with great regret that the 21.5\r\nmillion people who live in the Republic of China are not\r\nrepresented in this great Assembly. What is going on,\r\nMr. President? Everyone knows that the Republic of\r\nChina signed the United Nations Charter in 1945.\r\nDomestically, it maintains government structures\r\nguaranteeing its people the exercise of their fundamental\r\nrights and freedoms. In no international forum dealing\r\nwith this subject has the Government of the Republic of\r\nChina been described as a violator of inalienable rights.\r\nThe countries of South-East Asia have seen how the\r\neconomy and democratic development of the Republic of\r\nChina have been significant factors in the region’s\r\nstability. The international community can attest to the\r\nfact that the Republic of China bases its attitude on the\r\nprinciples that govern the United Nations Charter,\r\nparticularly in its peace-loving nature and its capacity to\r\nmake a positive response to the needs of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nBearing these facts in mind, I appeal to the\r\nAssembly to amend resolution 2758 (XXVI), which\r\nexcludes the Republic of China from the United Nations.\r\nWe ought to maintain the principle of universality through\r\nthe equal participation of all the States of the world. The\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua considers that the Republic of\r\nChina should enjoy equal opportunity to participate in the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. We cannot\r\nforget the right of those who freely chose to live in and\r\nto build the Republic of China and who want their\r\ncountry to be recognized with full and effective\r\nparticipation at the heart of this Organization.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nWe have a broad programme of work, which will\r\ncontribute not only to overcoming the obstacles that peoples\r\nand Governments face in achieving their goal of\r\nmaintaining and implementing fundamental values of\r\ndevelopment, social well-being and justice, but also to\r\npreparing for our entry into the twenty-first century with a\r\nrenewed and strengthened world Organization that can\r\nassist Governments to attain the well-being of their peoples.\r\nOn behalf of the Nicaraguan people, I ask God to\r\nbless the United Nations and all the peoples of the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of Nicaragua for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Leonid D. Kuchma, President of\r\nUkraine\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Leonid D. Kuchma, President of Ukraine, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His\r\nExcellency Mr. Leonid D. Kuchma, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kuchma (spoke in Ukrainian; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Mr. President, it is with pride\r\nthat I congratulate you, a representative of Ukraine, on your\r\nelection to the international community’s highest political\r\npost. I am confident that you will use to the full your rich\r\npolitical experience and internationally recognized\r\ndiplomatic skills, as well as your profound knowledge of\r\nthe United Nations system, to which you have devoted\r\nmore than 20 years of your life, to the benefit of mankind.\r\nI wish also to address words of gratitude to\r\nrepresentatives of all United Nations Member States for\r\ntheir support of the candidature of the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ukraine for the honourable and responsible\r\nposition of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsecond session. We interpret that support as a manifestation\r\nof a high level of confidence in Ukraine’s foreign policy,\r\nits peaceful initiatives and its commitment to the ideals of\r\nthe United Nations and to the objective of reviving and\r\nstrengthening the Organization. We regard it also as\r\nrecognition of Ukraine’s contribution to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, to the process of\r\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, to the\r\npromotion of the noble principles of democracy in\r\ninternational life and of respect for fundamental human\r\nrights and freedoms.\r\nAllow me also to pay a tribute to the President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session, Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail, who made a notable contribution to the\r\nOrganization’s progress along the path of reform.\r\nThe recent history of the United Nations and the\r\nhistory of the development of independent Ukraine have\r\nmuch in common. The first common feature is that both\r\nmy State and the United Nations are now experiencing\r\nthe complicated process of internal reform. Profound,\r\ncomprehensive change is proving to be an extremely\r\ndifficult matter. But the choice is final and irreversible:\r\nUkraine has become a democratic State with a policy\r\naimed at ensuring the needs and rights of its citizens, and\r\nat establishing a civil society. There is every reason to\r\nconclude that during our six years of independence we\r\nhave laid the foundation of further State-building.\r\nAs early as next year we will certainly experience\r\ngradual economic growth and the forging of a socially\r\noriented market economy in Ukraine. All the conditions\r\nnow exist for this to become reality, both internal — as\r\nillustrated by the political stability in Ukraine — and\r\nexternal.\r\nUkraine has consistently conducted, and is\r\ndetermined to continue, a policy aimed at strengthening\r\nsecurity and stability throughout the world. I would recall\r\nthat last year we removed the last nuclear warhead from\r\nour territory, thus transforming a nuclear-weapon State to\r\na non-nuclear-weapon State for the first time in history.\r\nUkraine thus demonstrated its good will, proved that\r\ngenuine nuclear disarmament is possible, and made a\r\nsubstantive contribution to the achievement of the ideal of\r\na nuclear-weapon-free world in the twenty-first century.\r\nNo less significant is my country’s contribution to\r\nradical positive changes in the Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean region, creating favourable conditions for a\r\nnew, more stable and more secure geopolitical situation\r\nthroughout the continent.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nImportant steps in that direction included the basic\r\npolitical treaties that Ukraine has signed with the Russian\r\nFederation and with Romania, and the agreement with the\r\nRepublic of Belarus on State borders, the first of the kind\r\nto be signed in the history of the newly independent States.\r\nThe signing by the Presidents of Ukraine and of\r\nPoland of the joint statement on reconciliation and unity\r\nwas of exceptional significance for the improvement of the\r\nsituation in Central and Eastern Europe. We view that\r\ndocument as exemplifying a balanced and unbiased\r\napproach to the evaluation of complex pages of history, and\r\nas a deliverance from the burden of the past for the sake of\r\nthe development of mutually beneficial cooperation now\r\nand in the future.\r\nThe resolution of the problem of the division of the\r\nBlack Sea fleet has contributed to enhanced security in the\r\nBlack Sea region and throughout Europe.\r\nAmong the most recent of important events, I wish to\r\nnote the signing at Madrid of the Charter on Special\r\nPartnership between Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO). The establishment of a special\r\npartnership with the alliance has tangibly strengthened\r\nconfidence in Europe and is now one of the important\r\nelements in the establishment of a new system of European\r\nsecurity.\r\nIt is generally acknowledged that the future of the\r\nEuropean security architecture as an important element of\r\nglobal security should be based on principles of\r\ncomprehensiveness, indivisibility and partnership, and, in\r\nthe long run, on collective rather than unilateral action. It\r\nis in that context that Ukraine is developing active\r\ncooperation with European and transatlantic security\r\nstructures.\r\nAn important place in Ukraine’s foreign policy\r\npriorities belongs to developing mutually beneficial\r\nrelations with the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica. Ukraine is also devoting special attention to the\r\nMovement of Non-aligned Countries, which is one of the\r\ninfluential factors in contemporary international relations.\r\nOur observer status in that movement testifies to the fact\r\nthat Ukraine is today a non-bloc country.\r\nAll of this can be summarized in a single conclusion:\r\nthanks to Ukraine’s persistent efforts, its borders are now\r\npeaceful and it is open to partnership with neighbouring\r\ncountries. Our multifaceted foreign policy has promoted the\r\nimage of Ukraine as a reliable and predictable partner.\r\nWe have been guided by, and still abide by, the\r\nwell-known principle: think globally and act locally. I\r\nbelieve that this approach — based, incidentally, on\r\nfundamental provisions of the United Nations Charter —\r\nwill lay the foundation for future relationships among all\r\nmembers of the world community.\r\nThe events on the European continent since the end\r\nof the Cold War have persuasively shown that threats to\r\nsecurity on the continent will henceforth emanate not\r\nfrom confrontation between military-political blocs, but\r\nrather from regional and local conflicts. A good reminder\r\nof this is the series of tragic events of recent years in the\r\nBalkans, in the Transdniestr region, in the Caucasus and\r\nelsewhere. At the same time, discussions on the future of\r\nEuropean security have so far focused mainly on the\r\nissues of NATO and European Union enlargement, the\r\nrole of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope and so forth. It is not my intention to minimize\r\nthe importance of these issues, but we are certain that all-\r\nEuropean stability will be unattainable without\r\nstrengthening regional security and establishing mutually\r\nbeneficial and good-neighbourly relations between\r\nUkraine and other nations.\r\nIt is to that end that European countries —\r\nespecially those of Central and Eastern Europe, among\r\nthem Ukraine — should exert the best of their efforts. It\r\nwas for this very reason that we proposed to hold in\r\nUkraine the 1999 summit meeting of the Baltic and Black\r\nSea States.\r\nBy the will of destiny, we are living at the threshold\r\nof a new millennium, which has coincided with a turning\r\npoint in the development of mankind. The United\r\nNations — a unique instrument for the maintenance and\r\nstrengthening of international peace and security —\r\nshould be well prepared for the changes ahead and should\r\nbe ready to respond to the challenges of today and of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIt is difficult to overestimate the positive changes in\r\nthe world in which the United Nations has played a key\r\nrole. It is true that the Organization has not been able\r\ncompletely to cure all social evils. However, it is equally\r\ntrue that the United Nations has always sent a timely\r\nsignal regarding the emergence of new hazards and has\r\nunited the world community to address urgent global\r\nproblems.\r\nThe substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates\r\nin particular to environmental protection in its global\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\ndimension: prohibiting chemical and bacteriological\r\nweapons and reducing nuclear weapons, as well as\r\nformulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping;\r\nensuring human rights; and codifying international law on\r\nnon-renewable resources.\r\nAt the same time, we must admit that the United\r\nNations has not always been able adequately to respond to\r\na number of the problems it has faced. This makes it\r\nnecessary further to improve its structure and internal\r\norganization and to increase the effectiveness of its work.\r\nUnfortunately, we must take note of the fact that no\r\ninstitution other than the United Nations so clearly confirms\r\nthe validity of Parkinson’s law, which states that the\r\nexpansion of bureaucracy has no limits. For that reason, I\r\nbelieve that today no one has any doubts that changes in\r\nthe United Nations are urgent and are objectively required.\r\nI hope that the current session will make a substantive\r\ncontribution to this important cause and that we will have\r\nall due reason to refer to it as “the session of reforms”.\r\nThe well-known seventeenth-century Ukrainian\r\nphilosopher and educator Hryhoriy Skovoroda once said\r\nthat\r\n“You do your best work and save yourself when you\r\nfirmly embark upon the road of common sense”.\r\nThis, in our view, is the path that the process of United\r\nNations reform should also take. Ukraine is actively\r\nsupporting measures aimed at bringing the structure and\r\ntasks of the Organization in line with new realities.\r\nIt is from this perspective that we are now considering\r\na package of proposals by the Secretary-General aimed at\r\na wide-scale reorganization of the United Nations structure\r\nand its programme activities. While these proposals may\r\nnot fully coincide with the interests of some countries or\r\nregions, they have been elaborated on the basis of\r\ncompromise and, in fact, constitute the first real attempt to\r\nstop marking time in the process of reforming the\r\nOrganization. Therefore we have to be pragmatic and\r\nattempt to avoid drowning this issue in endless discussions\r\nand appeals, as has happened repeatedly in the past.\r\nWe should begin without delay concrete work on the\r\nproposals of the Secretary-General, without dividing the\r\npackage into separate components. Furthermore, we must\r\nkeep in mind that the implementation of these proposals,\r\nfollowing their final approval and endorsement by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, will be only the initial stage in the\r\nprocess of the radical transformation of the United\r\nNations, which will have to embrace its most important\r\ncomponents, primarily the Security Council and the\r\nbudgetary and financial system.\r\nIn this context, equitable geographical representation\r\nin the Security Council and the increase of its\r\nmembership take on special importance. It would not be\r\na mistake to say that this problem is considered by the\r\nmajority of Member States as a priority issue and that its\r\nresolution, to a great extent, will determine the results and\r\nthe success of the reform of the Organization. In general,\r\nUkraine shares this point of view. But we also believe\r\nthat the overall process of the renewal and rebuilding both\r\nof the United Nations structure and of its activities should\r\nnot be held hostage to the solving of one issue, albeit a\r\nvery important one.\r\nThe negotiations that took place within the\r\nframework of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\r\nthe Membership of the Security Council during the fifty-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly were, in our\r\nopinion, useful and productive. The positions of many\r\nMember States have shifted, moving towards achieving\r\ncompromise. We can realistically expect participants in\r\nthe negotiations to reach the general accord that is\r\nnecessary for the adoption of a decision, as required by\r\nthe relevant resolution of the General Assembly. I should\r\nlike to call on Member States to exert maximum efforts\r\nto reach a consensus decision. The most important thing\r\nnow is to transcend nationally focused approaches by\r\ntaking into account the common interests of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nConcerning the enlargement of the Security Council,\r\nI believe that the solution to the problem should be based\r\non the following general principles.\r\nFirst, all the regional groups, including the Group of\r\nEastern European States, should enlarge their\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council; secondly, the\r\nenlargement should not negatively affect the efficiency of\r\nthe work of the Security Council; and thirdly, the process\r\nof enlargement should not be given a strict time limit,\r\nalthough a decision on this issue should preferably be\r\ntaken in the near future.\r\nThe elaboration and practical implementation of an\r\noverall concept of peacekeeping activities is an extremely\r\npressing issue that can be settled only within the\r\nframework of the United Nations. Two years ago, at the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization, I\r\nproposed gradually to re-orient United Nations\r\npeacekeeping activities towards preventive diplomacy. The\r\nexperience of Blue Helmets operations in hot spots around\r\nthe globe in recent years has further convinced us of the\r\nneed to strengthen the preventive component.\r\nIn this context, we consider the system of United\r\nNations standby agreements to be promising. Ukraine,\r\nstriving to make a real contribution to the strengthening of\r\nthis mechanism, recently signed the relevant memorandum\r\nof understanding with the United Nations.\r\nImproving the efficiency of peacekeeping operations\r\nis not an abstract notion for our country. Let us recall that\r\nthe first Ukrainian peacekeeping unit was deployed five\r\nyears ago to the United Nations peacekeeping force in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. Since then Ukraine has participated in\r\nmore than 10 United Nations peacekeeping operations. In\r\naddition, our military contingent has taken part in the\r\noperations of the multinational stabilization force in Bosnia.\r\nFrom this lofty rostrum, I reaffirm Ukraine’s readiness\r\nto participate directly in a settlement of the Georgian-\r\nAbkhaz conflict, to join the activities of the group of\r\ncountries known as Friends of the Secretary-General on\r\nGeorgia, and to dispatch its personnel to the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping mission in that country.\r\nUkraine will also continue its efforts to bring about a\r\nfinal settlement of the conflict in the Transdniestr, acting\r\ntogether with Russia and with the participation of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe as a\r\nguarantor of the special status of the Transdniestr as an\r\nintegral part of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nThe nineteenth special session of the General\r\nAssembly held earlier this year, which was devoted to\r\nreviewing progress in the implementation of Agenda 21,\r\nwas a major international event. I know that many countries\r\nhave assessed its results rather critically since, in their\r\nopinion, the session did not fully meet expectations. But it\r\ndid confirm the adherence of the overwhelming majority of\r\ncountries to the principles of sustainable development\r\ndeclared in Rio, and it also provided the world community\r\nwith a number of constructive proposals with regard to a\r\nfurther strengthening of global partnership in the field of\r\nenvironment protection.\r\nWe must all remember the equal right of present and\r\nfuture generations to a viable living environment. Our\r\nshared obligation to them is to join our efforts for the\r\nsake of the survival and development of human\r\ncivilization. That was the essence of Ukraine’s proposal\r\nconcerning the elaboration in future of an international\r\nlegal document that would serve as a reliable legal basis\r\nfor safe and sustainable development worldwide.\r\nFor Ukraine, environmental problems are not just\r\nabstract theory. The Chernobyl nuclear-power plant\r\naccident has been a real national tragedy for my country.\r\nEvery year up to 15 per cent of the State budget is spent\r\non compensating for the losses it has caused and on\r\nensuring social benefits for the people affected.\r\nUkraine made a political commitment to\r\ndecommission the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by the\r\nend of the millennium and has made continuous efforts to\r\nfulfil it. We expect other countries to meet their\r\ncommitments in this regard.\r\nAt the same time, the problem of Chernobyl cannot\r\nbe limited to the decommissioning of the nuclear power\r\nplant. This accident unleashed a series of problems that\r\nare global in nature and could scarcely be overcome alone\r\nby even the most developed nations. Chernobyl today is\r\nnot the exclusive problem of Ukraine. In paying tribute to\r\nthe United Nations efforts aimed at eliminating the\r\nconsequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear\r\npower plant, I wish to emphasize that an overall solution\r\nto this global problem is simply impossible without large-\r\nscale international assistance.\r\nAt present, the United Nations is going through a\r\ndifficult but crucial moment of renewal. The same can be\r\nsaid about Ukraine, which is more than ever before\r\nconscious of its dependence on the world order and relies\r\non the support of the international community. That is\r\nwhy the question of what form the world order will\r\nassume in the future — to which this session is expected\r\nto provide an answer — is of particular and, without\r\nexaggeration, fateful importance to us.\r\nThe future of the world order, of the United Nations\r\nand of every country, is our common future. Thus, while\r\ndeciding today on the fate of the United Nations, we\r\nshould be aware that we are also determining our own\r\ndestiny.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank His Excellency, the President of Ukraine,\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nMr. Leonid D. Kuchma, President of Ukraine, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, Prime\r\nMinister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of\r\nPakistan.\r\nMr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, and inviting\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Sharif (Pakistan): May I begin with a verse from\r\nthe Holy Koran:\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\n“To each is a goal\r\nTo which God turns him;\r\nThen strive together\r\nTowards all that is good.\r\nWheresoever ye are,\r\nGod will bring you\r\nTogether. For God\r\nHath power over all things.” (The Holy Koran, II:148)\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI convey to you, Sir, and to the nations assembled\r\nhere the greetings of our people in this golden jubilee year\r\nof Pakistan’s independence.\r\nSoon after achieving its independence, Pakistan was\r\nadmitted to the United Nations. The half-century of\r\nPakistan’s and the United Nations existence has been\r\neventful. Through years of upheavals and dislocations,\r\nthrough turbulence and brief moments of tranquillity, we\r\nnow stand at the threshold of a new century and a new\r\nmillennium. The theme of world affairs has been\r\ntransformed.\r\nDuring these 50 years, Pakistan has demonstrated its\r\ncommitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations in word and deed. We have\r\nfulfilled our obligations to this Organization. We have\r\nadhered to its resolutions. We have contributed politically\r\nand materially to its collective endeavour to build peace\r\nand promote prosperity. We are especially proud of our\r\ncontribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\nworldwide.\r\nI wish to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his determination and vision in carrying out\r\nhis responsibilities. I would like to assure him that\r\nPakistan will, as always, support all initiatives for the\r\nrealization of the objectives set out in the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nWe are fortunate to have a person of your stature\r\nand experience, Sir, to guide this session of the General\r\nAssembly. The items on its agenda are important and\r\nconsequential, particularly the crucial issue of United\r\nNations reform. I wish you every success.\r\nDoctrines of confrontation and containment are no\r\nlonger valid. The new idea of our times is that of global\r\npartnership between the North and the South, the East and\r\nthe West. The United Nations must forge this global\r\ncompact. The creed of our era is peace and development.\r\nThis is what the United Nations must focus on as it\r\nstrives to bring about organizational reform. We support\r\nthe process of reform in the United Nations. In pursuing\r\nthis objective, we must bear in mind our successes and\r\nfailures of the past 50 years. The centrality and sanctity\r\nof the Charter must be preserved as we move towards\r\nreconfiguring the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations today stands at the brink of\r\nbankruptcy. The reform cannot and must not be victim to\r\nthe narrow strategic, political and administrative\r\npreferences of a chosen few as a means of regaining the\r\nOrganization’s solvency. True reform has to take into\r\naccount the interests of all. The United Nations is a\r\nuniversal Organization of 185 States and their 6 billion\r\npeople. The purpose of its creation was to serve the\r\ninterests of all humankind. This should be the guiding\r\nprinciple for its reform.\r\nThere is undoubtedly need for reform. The map of\r\nthe world has been redrawn. Many new States have\r\nemerged since 1945, when the United Nations was\r\nestablished. The reform that is envisaged must be\r\ndesigned to facilitate the objectives for which the United\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nNations was created: to promote global peace, security,\r\ncooperation and prosperity.\r\nMore than mere lip service must be done to the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter, such as\r\nthe sovereign equality of all its Members and equal rights\r\nfor all nations, large or small. The emergence of five veto-\r\nwielding permanent members of the Security Council was\r\nthe consequence of an unfortunate afterthought. It was\r\ncompletely incompatible with the democratic ethos of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. The result was the impotence and\r\ninaction of the United Nations during the cold war years.\r\nThe legitimization and enlargement of the privileged club\r\nof veto powers would deal a crippling body blow to the\r\nability of the United Nations to carry out its responsibilities.\r\nThe contours of a multipolar world are gradually\r\nemerging. In the event of a resumption of great-Power\r\nrivalries, the proliferation of the veto will once again freeze\r\nthe Security Council into irrelevance.\r\nIt is ironical that the countries which practice\r\ndemocracy at home and advocate it abroad should want to\r\ncreate a new aristocracy of States. Any decision on Security\r\nCouncil reform that is not backed by the consensus of all\r\nthe Member States of the United Nations will erode the\r\ncredibility and undermine the legitimacy of the Council and\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations rejects hegemony.\r\nInternational peace and security have to be built through\r\ncooperative efforts. This entails the resolution of disputes\r\nthrough negotiations, mediation and arbitration. It means\r\nremoving the causes of war and conflict. It involves the\r\npromotion of global prosperity and development. It\r\nnecessitates adherence to the resolutions of the United\r\nNations, particularly those of the Security Council.\r\nThe enforcement of peace should be undertaken only\r\nin response to actual acts of aggression or breaches. It must\r\nbe pursued collectively and fairly, not imposed arbitrarily\r\nby the strong over the weak. Nowhere does the Charter\r\nprovide for pre-emptive penalties against States for arms\r\nproliferation or presumed threats to peace.\r\nA central weakness of the United Nations is that some\r\nmembers are expected to pay their contributions to its\r\nbudget fully, unconditionally and on time, while others\r\ndelay payments. The principle of capacity-to-pay-is fair; it\r\nshould not be unilaterally discarded. At the same time,\r\nalternate sources of funding have to be explored in order to\r\nmake the United Nations immune to pressure, unhealthy\r\ninfluence and hostile onslaughts.\r\nThe intention of the Charter was to place the United\r\nNations at the apex of the system of international\r\norganizations that were created at the end of the Second\r\nWorld War. The Charter rightly perceived political,\r\nsecurity, economic, social, cultural and humanitarian\r\nissues to be interrelated. It therefore called for\r\ncoordinated approaches and policies to address those\r\nissues. To achieve this, it is essential for the United\r\nNations to become the central link for the entire family of\r\ninternational organizations, without exception. Only then\r\nwill the world community be able to address successfully\r\nthe host of diverse, complex and interrelated problems it\r\nconfronts.\r\nOn its fiftieth anniversary, Pakistan — like the\r\nUnited Nations — has embarked upon the course of\r\nreform and renewal. In this endeavour, we are inspired by\r\nthe eternal ideals of Islam in which justice, equity and\r\nhuman rights, especially those of women and minorities,\r\nare the central pillars. Islam draws no distinction between\r\ncreeds. It accepts all religions. Thus, the Holy Koran\r\ndeclares:\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\n“Say ye: We believe\r\nIn God, and the revelation\r\nGiven to us, and to Abraham,\r\nIsmā ı̄ l, Isaac, Jacob,\r\nAnd the Tribes, and that given\r\nTo Moses and Jesus, and that given\r\nTo (all) Prophets from their Lord:\r\nWe make no difference\r\nBetween one and another of them:\r\nAnd we bow to God (in Islam).\u0027” (The Holy Koran,\r\nII:136)\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nMy Government is vigorously addressing the\r\npolitical, economic and social problems we inherited from\r\nthe past. We have taken measures to consolidate\r\nparliamentary democracy through constitutional means; to\r\nrestore financial equilibrium through austerity and\r\nstructural adjustments while enhancing business incentives\r\nand economic liberalization; to combat corruption, drugs\r\nand terrorism — which is often sponsored from abroad —\r\nthrough effective law enforcement and speedy and fair\r\njustice.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nThese policies have yielded dividends. We look to the\r\nfuture with hope and optimism. Our economy is open and\r\ndynamic. Domestic and foreign investment is growing\r\nrapidly. Our people are imaginative, skilful and hard-\r\nworking. We have demonstrated that we can master the\r\nmost advanced technologies. We can now deter external\r\naggression. With confidence in ourselves, we seek\r\nfriendship and cooperation with all our neighbours on the\r\nbasis of equality.\r\nPakistan strives for peace and stability in its region.\r\nWe seek an early end to the conflict in Afghanistan; a just\r\nand fair settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in\r\naccordance with the resolutions of the United Nations; an\r\nend to the wasteful arms race in South Asia; and the\r\ndevelopment of the immense economic and commercial\r\npotential of South and Central Asia.\r\nWe have the courage to strive for peace and the\r\nwisdom to know that it is essential for development. South\r\nAsia, with one-fifth of the world’s population, remains\r\nmired in poverty and deprivation. I call upon India to join\r\nus in liberating our peoples from the dreadful grip of\r\npoverty. This can only be achieved by removing the causes\r\nof conflict and hostility.\r\nThe conflict that has ravaged Afghanistan for almost\r\ntwo decades must be brought to an end. No country in the\r\nworld has suffered more than Pakistan as a consequence of\r\nthe turmoil. We therefore have a vital interest in the\r\nrestoration of durable peace and stability in Afghanistan.\r\nTowards this end we have been in contact with all Afghan\r\ngroups in support of the efforts of the United Nations\r\naimed at promoting an intra-Afghan peace process.\r\nWe favour no faction in Afghanistan. We have\r\nrecognized the present authorities in Kabul, as we did the\r\nprevious entities that controlled the capital. We have\r\nencouraged moderation and dialogue so that a stable, multi-\r\nethnic Government can emerge. We request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations to take specific initiatives for\r\nthe early restoration of peace and the preservation of the\r\nsovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.\r\nMy Government has also taken initiatives to resume\r\nthe stalled dialogue with India. We had agreed last June on\r\na comprehensive agenda and a mechanism to deal with all\r\nissues, including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir, in\r\na sustained manner. We have, unfortunately, not yet\r\nsucceeded in setting up the agreed mechanism to launch\r\nsubstantive negotiations on all the issues on the agenda of\r\nour dialogue. We hope that India will reciprocate our\r\nsincerity of purpose in substantively addressing all the\r\nissues and carrying forward this process of dialogue to a\r\npositive outcome.\r\nThe resolutions of the Security Council define\r\nKashmir as a disputed territory whose accession to either\r\nPakistan or India is to be determined through a plebiscite\r\nsupervised by the United Nations. Under the Simla\r\nAgreement of 1972, India agreed to a final settlement of\r\nthe Jammu and Kashmir dispute with Pakistan.\r\nThe existence of the Kashmir dispute cannot be\r\ndenied. The right of self-determination is sacrosanct. It\r\nhas repeatedly been affirmed by the United Nations. The\r\npeople of Kashmir are justified in asking why this pledge\r\nby the international community has not been honoured as\r\nyet. The Security Council cannot be selective in the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions.\r\nThe Kashmiri people have risen against Indian\r\noccupation. Their resolute struggle for the restitution of\r\ntheir fundamental rights belies the claim that Kashmir is\r\nan integral part of India.\r\nI am sad to say that the repression of the people of\r\nJammu and Kashmir continues unabated. More than\r\n600,000 Indian troops in Kashmir continue to brutalize\r\nthe people. Custodial killings, disappearances, arbitrary\r\narrests and summary executions are daily occurrences.\r\nThousands of Kashmiri civilians have been killed, while\r\n32,000 languish in detention centres. I learned just this\r\nmorning of the shelling of Arin in Kashmir by the Indian\r\nforces yesterday, a mortar attack in which 11 persons\r\nwere killed and 12 injured. Six children and three women\r\nwere among the dead. This is an altogether familiar\r\noccurrence in occupied Kashmir.\r\nIf India is serious in its allegation that the conflict in\r\nKashmir is being stoked by interference from Pakistan it\r\nshould have no hesitation in allowing the United Nations\r\nobservers present in Kashmir to verify this claim. We\r\nhope that the United Nations will increase the number of\r\nthese observers and ask India to allow their stationing on\r\nits side of the line of control as well.\r\nThe international community has a responsibility to\r\nbring about a just settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The\r\npledge of self-determination given to the people of\r\nJammu and Kashmir has to be redeemed. On our part, we\r\nwelcome the offers made by the Secretary-General, the\r\nUnited States and others to help in resolving the Kashmir\r\ndispute.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nMy Government will persevere in the dialogue with\r\nIndia for the sake of our people and the peoples of South\r\nAsia. We hope that India can be persuaded to take some\r\nsteps to create a climate conducive to the success of the\r\ntalks. These could include, first, a halt in its campaign of\r\nrepression against the people of Kashmir; secondly, the\r\nwithdrawal of at least those Indian troops which are\r\nengaged in internal repression in Kashmir; and, finally, the\r\nevolution of a mechanism to take into account the wishes\r\nof the Kashmiri people, as stipulated by the United Nations,\r\nfor a final settlement.\r\nIt is imperative now to negotiate arrangements to\r\nstrengthen peace and security between India and Pakistan.\r\nSince 1974 Pakistan has pursued its proposal for a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in South Asia. On the other hand, India\r\nhas taken successive steps to escalate its nuclear and\r\nmissile capabilities. What does India mean when it\r\nrepeatedly asserts that its nuclear option is “open”? Does\r\nthis imply that, like chemical weapons, India has already\r\nmanufactured nuclear weapons? In the absence of any\r\nassurances to the contrary, Pakistan will have to assume the\r\nworst.\r\nIndia’s nuclear-capable Prithvi missile is being serially\r\nproduced. These missiles specifically target Pakistan. They\r\nhave been moved adjacent to our borders. This creates a\r\nhair-trigger security environment. The development and\r\npossible deployment of the medium-range Agni missile and\r\nIndia’s planned acquisition of theatre missile-defence\r\nsystems will further aggravate this tense security\r\nenvironment. It will evoke the natural response from\r\nPakistan to safeguard and augment its security and\r\ndeterrence capability. India must be persuaded to reverse its\r\nmissile programme.\r\nTo preserve peace and stability in South Asia and\r\nbeyond, we propose that Pakistan and India should reach\r\nagreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear and\r\nballistic fields. In this context, we are deeply concerned\r\nabout India’s acquisition of missiles and its plans for the\r\nacquisition of anti-missile systems. We also propose a\r\nsimilar arrangement for mutual and equitable restraint on\r\nconventional weapons which ensures equal security to both\r\nPakistan and India.\r\nWe are prepared to conclude and strengthen\r\nconfidence- building measures. As a first step, we could\r\nagree on a set of principles to guide future bilateral arms-\r\ncontrol arrangements.\r\nWe believe that a just settlement of the Jammu and\r\nKashmir dispute and progress on the issues of peace and\r\nsecurity will usher in an era of amity and progress in\r\nSouth Asia. To facilitate the realization of this objective,\r\nI offer today, from this rostrum, to open negotiations on\r\na treaty of non-aggression between Pakistan and India.\r\nThere are many areas in which we can cooperate for\r\nmutual benefit. Trade liberalization can take place on an\r\nequitable basis. Significant foreign investment can be\r\ndrawn to the region.\r\nIn the expectation that the Pakistan-India dialogue\r\nwill have made a heartening advance by next year, my\r\nGovernment intends to host a regional economic summit\r\nin 1998, which could help to open new vistas for\r\neconomic progress and prosperity for our region.\r\nAll this and much more can be achieved if India\r\njoins us in pursuing our current dialogue to its successful\r\nculmination. We have demonstrated our sincerity of\r\npurpose. It is for India to reciprocate.\r\nLocated at the nexus of Central Asia, South Asia and\r\nthe Middle East, Pakistan can contribute to and gain from\r\nthe economic growth and interaction between these\r\ndynamic regions. The United Nations and its family of\r\norganizations have a crucial role to play in generating\r\nprosperity and restoring peace with justice to these vital\r\nregions of the world.\r\nToday, I wish to renew Pakistan’s commitment to\r\nthe United Nations, to its purposes and principles and to\r\nits vision of a world where genuine peace reigns and\r\nprosperity is universal. The vision of the founding fathers\r\nof the United Nations must continue to serve as a beacon\r\nguiding us across the uncharted waters of the coming\r\nmillennium. The Charter of the United Nations and its\r\ntimeless principles provide us the anchor to weather\r\nturmoil and turbulence. Let us renew our determination to\r\ndefend and preserve this anchor of hope and faith. Let not\r\npolitical expediencies infringe or erode the fundamentals\r\nof international cooperation enshrined in the Charter.\r\nWe in Pakistan, who had dared to dream of freedom\r\n50 years ago, are resolved to defend freedom — freedom\r\nfrom war, oppression, injustice, poverty and deprivation.\r\nLet us all move together towards realizing the vision of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic\r\nof Pakistan for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Norway, His Excellency Mr. Bjørn\r\nTore Godal.\r\nMr. Godal (Norway): First, I join other speakers in\r\ncongratulating my Ukrainian colleague upon his election to\r\nhis high office.\r\nLast week in Oslo, almost 100 countries agreed to a\r\nConvention text for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.\r\nWho would have imagined, only a year ago, such a\r\nremarkable achievement in such a short time? Thanks to the\r\ntireless efforts and model cooperation of Governments, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and civil society, we have\r\nreached this milestone event. I would like to extend a\r\nspecial tribute to the International Campaign to Ban\r\nLandmines and the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross. They have been a driving force in our efforts to get\r\nrid of the scourge that landmines represent in the lives of\r\nmen, women and children in conflict areas around the\r\nworld.\r\nAt the beginning of December we will meet in Ottawa\r\nfor the signing of the Convention. I appeal to all countries\r\nengaged in this process to ratify the Convention. To those\r\nwho have not yet joined us, I say: “Please do so as soon as\r\npossible”. Landmines cannot be allowed to terrorize, maim\r\nor kill more innocent civilians. The United Nations and its\r\nMembers have an important role to play and responsibility\r\nfor bringing success to the Ottawa process. I appreciate the\r\nsupport of the Secretary-General and welcome the fact that\r\nhe will be the depositary of the treaty. We all have a strong\r\nmoral obligation to increase our efforts to reduce the\r\nsuffering and prevent new casualties caused by landmines.\r\nNorway intends to provide $100 million over a five-year\r\nperiod for mine clearance and assistance to victims.\r\nThe spread of landmines, small arms and weapons of\r\nmass destruction is unfortunately only one of the many\r\ninterlinked global challenges illustrating that the world now,\r\nmore than ever, needs the United Nations as a well-\r\nfunctioning global Organization. At the threshold of the\r\nthird millennium, it is unacceptable that poverty and\r\npollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people\r\nall over the world; it is unacceptable that hostilities and\r\nhatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian\r\ndisasters, between and within States on all continents; and\r\nit is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights\r\nare still widely violated through injustice by Governments\r\nand the negligence of the international community.\r\nMr. Young (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nOnly the United Nations can tackle these universal\r\nand interdependent problems in a comprehensive and\r\nintegrated manner. But the world has surely undergone\r\nradical changes since 1945, and so has the nature of the\r\ntasks confronting us. Hence, the United Nations also\r\nneeds to change in order to do better what the Member\r\nStates want it to do. I was therefore very pleased by the\r\nletter that Mr. Kofi Annan sent to all of our Governments\r\nlast month. In clear and concise terms, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral set out the elements of what is without doubt the\r\nmost comprehensive reform package in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLet me state clearly that Norway warmly welcomes\r\nand fully supports the Secretary-General’s programme for\r\nreform and renewal of the United Nations. Together with\r\nthe other Nordic countries, we have given our strong\r\npolitical backing to his reform proposals. We will work\r\nactively with other Member States to ensure that the\r\nGeneral Assembly endorses the reform package this\r\nautumn. We want the reform plans to be implemented as\r\nsoon as possible. Norway urgently wants a stronger and\r\nmore efficient United Nations. Without such reform, we\r\nwill have an Organization less able to promote\r\ndevelopment, peace and progress.\r\nNorway is, as many know, one of the main\r\ncontributors to the United Nations system. We are one of\r\nthe group of countries that fulfil the aim of allocating\r\nmore than 0.7 per cent of our gross national product to\r\ndevelopment. One out of every 100 Norwegians has\r\nparticipated in peacekeeping operations around the world.\r\nIn terms of money, resources and personnel, our voluntary\r\nassistance to humanitarian relief activities, is, I am proud\r\nto say, second to none. But we want to make sure that\r\nour contribution is put to good use. We want to see it\r\nutilized by the United Nations to improve the lives of\r\npeople where the needs are the greatest. That is why we\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s reform proposals.\r\nFirst of all, the reforms will ensure that more\r\nresources are allocated more efficiently for development.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nThe Secretary-General’s excellent proposal to use\r\nadministrative savings for a “development dividend” is but\r\none element in the process. We encourage him to continue\r\nfurther on the course that he has taken. United Nations\r\nactivities targeting sustainable development, poverty,\r\npopulation, education, the promotion of the role of women\r\nin development and the implementation of the results of the\r\nBeijing Conference must be strengthened and integrated at\r\nthe headquarters and field levels. Health should be among\r\nthe main priorities. Increased international efforts are\r\nneeded to assist developing countries in improving their\r\nnational health policies and to combat emerging and\r\nre-emerging diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and\r\nAIDS. Member States must follow up by fulfilling their\r\nobligations to increase their transfers of aid to the\r\ndeveloping countries and peoples that need it the most.\r\nHopefully, this will also have the effect of creating the\r\nconfidence needed to bring us forward in the Rio process,\r\ntowards renewed environmental commitments which can\r\npave the way for a successful meeting in Kyoto later this\r\nyear.\r\nSecondly, the reforms will strengthen the ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to manage conflicts. Too often, the United\r\nNations has shown a lack of capacity to act rapidly in the\r\nface of emerging crises. Therefore, we believe it is high\r\ntime to establish a rapid-deployment mission headquarters\r\nfor peacekeeping and other operations. Norway has offered\r\nto provide funding for personnel for this headquarters.\r\nFurthermore, we encourage other Member States to\r\ncontribute to the Trust Fund for Preventive Action, which\r\nwas established this year. We are pleased to note that the\r\nFund has already facilitated the work of the Special Envoy\r\nof the Secretary-General in Central Africa. We want to\r\ncooperate closely on conflict resolution with our friends and\r\npartners in Africa, including through our training\r\nprogrammes for peacekeeping tasks in that region.\r\nThirdly, the reforms will extend the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations in the human rights field. Norway welcomes\r\nthe proposals to strengthen the human rights secretariat and\r\nthe excellent choice of Mary Robinson as High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We pledge to work\r\nclosely with her to ensure that the international community\r\nincreases its focus on human rights violations. Human\r\nrights concerns must become an integral part of all core\r\nareas of the Organization’s work, including at Headquarters\r\nin New York.\r\nWe must follow up reform of the Security Council.\r\nOur position is, I believe, well known: the Council must be\r\nmade more representative and should better reflect changes\r\nin political and economic realities. We want new\r\npermanent seats for Germany and Japan and for the\r\ndeveloping countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.\r\nAt the same time, a limited number of new non-\r\npermanent seats should be added.\r\nWe need financial reform and changes to the scale\r\nof assessments. Some countries have experienced high\r\nand sustained economic growth, but still resist reforms\r\nwhich would better reflect their increased capacity to pay.\r\nOther countries feel that they are paying too much. We\r\nagree that the time has come to show flexibility in the\r\ndiscussions on lowering the ceiling on the scale of\r\nassessments to the United Nations budgets, as part of an\r\noverall solution. It cannot be justified that some countries\r\nunilaterally pay less than their legally binding share, or\r\nnothing at all. Non-payment is unacceptable. How can\r\nthose of us who always make a point of paying in full\r\nand on time, without conditions, expect our citizens and\r\ntaxpayers to continue financing free riders?\r\nWe need better integration and coordination within\r\nthe United Nations system and between the United\r\nNations, regional organizations, Governments, civil\r\nsociety and non-governmental actors. For Norway, this is\r\nnot least important in the area of humanitarian assistance.\r\nWe welcome the proposal to enhance the capacity of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator to deal more effectively\r\nwith complex emergencies.\r\nIn Bosnia we are engaged in peace-building under\r\nvery difficult conditions. Men and women are serving a\r\nwide range of different organizations: the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization, the United Nations civilian police,\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and humanitarian non-governmental\r\norganizations. Without the excellent coordination and\r\ncooperation that has evolved between the High\r\nRepresentative, the United Nations Special Representative,\r\nthe Stabilization Force Commander, the OSCE Head of\r\nMission and others, the peace-implementation process\r\nwould have been in dire straits indeed.\r\nNationalist leaders in Bosnia are still inciting hatred.\r\nRefugees are being denied their right to return to their\r\nhomes. Our personnel are being threatened. War criminals\r\nare still at large. But despite the failure of local leaders to\r\nfulfil their obligations, the recently held elections show\r\nthat the international community has given this country\r\nhope for the future. We will stay the course and remain\r\nengaged in Bosnia until peace is consolidated. We will\r\ninsist that wanted war criminals be brought to justice. The\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nconvening of a United Nations conference to establish a\r\npermanent international criminal court in 1998 must be\r\ngiven priority.\r\nNorway remains committed to the Middle East peace\r\nprocess. While we will continue to work actively with other\r\ndonor countries to ensure the availability of funding, we are\r\nextremely concerned by the current deadlock. The parties\r\nmust realize that there is no alternative to the peace process\r\nand to the fulfilment of the spirit and the letter of the Oslo\r\naccords. Further credible efforts to combat terrorism must\r\nbe undertaken. The current settlements policy is not\r\nconducive to the peace process. We must redouble our\r\nefforts to bring the parties back into dialogue about the\r\nremaining issues.\r\nWe must not forget the success stories of United\r\nNations conflict resolution. Just since last year, for\r\nexample, the decades-long civil war in Guatemala has\r\nended peacefully. We have had the pleasure of working\r\nwith the United Nations and others, like the Group of\r\nFriends for Guatemala, in seeing through the ceasefire\r\nagreement signed in Oslo and the other peace accords.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to commend the\r\nGovernment of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria\r\nNacional Guatemalteca for their courage and determination\r\nto see the peace process succeed.\r\nFinally, our experience in Guatemala and other\r\nconflict areas corroborates the importance that the\r\nSecretary-General attaches to the close interaction between\r\nthe civil society, Governments and the United Nations. We\r\nmust make use of the dedication, resources and\r\ncommitment to peace and progress that exist among\r\ncitizens, in non-governmental organizations and in the\r\nprivate sector. Through the active involvement and support\r\nof civil society, we can build a stronger and more effective\r\nworld Organization for the next century.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of South Africa, His Excellency Mr. Alfred\r\nNzo.\r\nMr. Nzo (South Africa): South Africa welcomes your\r\nelection, Sir, as the President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-second session. We congratulate you having\r\nexperienced at first hand your skills and role as Vice-\r\nChairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid. We\r\nalso express our appreciation to Ambassador Razali Ismail\r\nfor his tireless work as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-first session.\r\nMay I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan on his election as the seventh Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations. The zeal that the Secretary-General\r\nhas displayed in addressing, through his reform proposals,\r\nthe difficulties confronting this Organization is\r\nimpressive. The Secretary-General’s reform programme\r\nis one that in many respects complements the\r\nintergovernmental process regarding the revitalization of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe General Assembly is well aware of the need to\r\nreform the United Nations. The process of reform should\r\nproduce a revitalized Organization capable of addressing\r\nhumanity’s vital issues of peace and security. Central to\r\nthe process of modernization of the United Nations is the\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council to redress existing\r\nimbalances and transform it into a transparent organ\r\naccountable to the broader membership of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nSouth Africa fully supports the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement’s position that there should be no partial or\r\nselective expansion in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil to the detriment of developing countries.\r\nThe reaffirmation at the Organization of African\r\nUnity’s Harare Summit of Africa’s claim to two\r\npermanent and five non-permanent seats, with the same\r\npowers and prerogatives enjoyed by the current permanent\r\nmembers in an expanded Security Council, is consistent\r\nwith the Charter principle of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation. If the Security Council is to fulfil the role\r\nof custodian of international peace and security envisaged\r\nfor it in the Charter, it must be perceived to be fully\r\nlegitimate by States and peoples.\r\nSouth Africa is therefore of the view that a limited\r\nexpansion of only five or six new Security Council seats\r\nwill not fulfil the crucial requirement of transforming the\r\nSecurity Council into a representative organ.\r\nCentral to the Security Council reform process is the\r\nquestion of the veto, which has been a focal point in our\r\ndeliberations for the last three and a half years. Indeed,\r\nthe democratization of the Council hinges on the veto\r\nbeing either eliminated or extended to the new permanent\r\nmembers. Accordingly, the issue of the status of the veto\r\nmust of necessity form an integral part of a\r\ncomprehensive reform package. Permanent membership\r\nwithout the veto represents merely a symbolic gesture to\r\nnew permanent members which would serve to perpetuate\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nan unjust and discriminatory practice and accord them an\r\ninferior status.\r\nI wish to recall that last year in the General Assembly,\r\nI registered South Africa’s disappointment with the slow\r\npace of the debate relating to the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. The time has come for us all to display the\r\nnecessary political will and determination in order to reach\r\nagreement on a comprehensive set of measures which will\r\nlead to the creation of a Security Council which is\r\ntransparent, democratic, accountable and thus credible and\r\nlegitimate.\r\nThe fifty-first session of the General Assembly also\r\nwitnessed the conclusion of the work of the Open-ended\r\nHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations System. Its notable recommendations\r\nregarding the strengthening of the role and functions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly attest to the importance which we as\r\nMember States attach to this body as the supreme political\r\norgan of the Organization.\r\nIt is, however, disappointing that on the issue relating\r\nto the election of a Secretary-General, the Working Group\r\nwas unable to reach consensus on the recommendation to\r\nthe permanent members of the Security Council to refrain\r\nfrom using the veto to block the outcome of the election.\r\nAs a result of Africa’s painful past experiences under\r\ncolonial domination, as well as the abhorrent system of\r\napartheid, my Government is committed to the final\r\neradication of colonialism and fully supports the effective\r\nimplementation of the Plan of Action for the International\r\nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism. We believe,\r\ntherefore, that the Committee of 24 should continue its\r\nwork in order to determine the interests of the peoples of\r\nNon-Self-Governing Territories regarding their future\r\npolitical status. We call on the administering Powers to lend\r\ntheir full cooperation to the Committee.\r\nSouth Africa is concerned that intra-State conflicts in\r\nAfrica continue to pose a threat to the continent’s stability.\r\nThese conflicts lead to loss of life and economic hardships\r\nand are a major stumbling block on the road towards peace\r\nand development. It is a matter of concern that conflicts in\r\nAfrica persist despite the commendable efforts of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and of African leaders in\r\nconflict resolution.\r\nWe therefore urge parties to the conflict in the\r\nRepublic of the Congo to observe the ceasefire agreement\r\nand to make all efforts to ensure that the interim measures\r\nfor the holding of national elections in 1998 are instituted.\r\nSimilarly, we condemn the coup in Sierra Leone and\r\nimplore Member States of the United Nations to support\r\nAfrica’s efforts to restore constitutional order by\r\nrefraining from recognizing or giving support in any form\r\nto the military Government.\r\nSouth Africa is committed to the promotion of peace\r\nin Angola, which we believe will contribute to the\r\nconsolidation and extension of stability to the whole of\r\nour region of southern Africa. We are therefore concerned\r\nabout the failure of UNITA to fulfil its obligations under\r\nthe Lusaka Protocol. In this regard, my Government\r\nwelcomes the decision of the Security Council to impose\r\nthe punitive measures envisaged in its resolution 1127\r\n(1997), as a means of ensuring UNITA’s compliance.\r\nSouth Africa has followed the unfolding\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East with cautious optimism.\r\nSouth Africa, and indeed the international community,\r\nwelcomed the signing of the Oslo accord by the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and the Israeli Government and\r\napplauded it as representing a positive step towards the\r\nfull realization of the long-awaited comprehensive and\r\njust settlement in the region. But the decision of the\r\nGovernment of Israel to construct new Jewish settlements\r\nin Jebel Abu Ghneim has given rise to tensions and has\r\ngenerated a crisis situation which has reignited conflict in\r\nthe region. We all know that this decision is a flagrant\r\nviolation of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and\r\nof the relevant resolutions of this body. It is no doubt an\r\nattempt to change the legal status of Jerusalem and to pre-\r\nempt the final status negotiations.\r\nThe inalienable right of the Palestinian people to\r\nself-determination is a prerequisite for achieving a durable\r\nand comprehensive peace. For peace and stability to\r\nprevail, the region requires the unconditional withdrawal\r\nof Israel from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied\r\nsince 1967.\r\nSouth Africa welcomes the Secretary-General’s latest\r\ninitiatives currently under way to seek a lasting solution\r\nto the question of Cyprus. We urge all parties to make\r\nconcerted efforts in working with the Secretary-General\r\nand his good offices towards an overall comprehensive\r\nsettlement to this question, which has been on the agenda\r\nof the United Nations for more than 30 years.\r\nSouth Africa attaches great importance to preventive\r\ndiplomacy as a means of forestalling the possibility of\r\nconflict. We commend the report of the Special\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nCommittee on Peacekeeping Operations because it provides\r\nus with measures aimed at strengthening the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in peacekeeping. We also welcome the\r\nCommittee’s 1997 report on peacekeeping operations and\r\nurge the Committee to address the question of the rapidly\r\ndeployable mission headquarters and the further\r\ndevelopment of United Nations standby arrangements.\r\nSouth Africa believes that progress on disarmament\r\nissues will create a world free of war. The end of the cold\r\nwar heralded a period of progress in disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation, as was evidenced by the entry into force of\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and the conclusion of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. However, the\r\nre-emergence of maximalist positions in the disarmament\r\ndebate retards global disarmament, as demonstrated by the\r\ndisappointing progress made at the Conference on\r\nDisarmament this year. Despite the consensual adoption of\r\na mandate for the negotiation of a fissile-material cut-off\r\ntreaty, one of the essential elements for complete nuclear\r\ndisarmament, little progress has been made. Nevertheless,\r\nSouth Africa is encouraged by the large number of States\r\nwhich have committed themselves to the complete\r\neradication of weapons of mass destruction by joining\r\nvarious non-proliferation and disarmament treaties during\r\nthe past year. Universal adherence to important\r\ndisarmament treaties will pave the way towards a world\r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nHumanity is faced with the daily threat of harm from\r\nthe use of conventional weapons. High priority should be\r\nplaced on strategies and policies intended to prevent the\r\nproliferation of conventional weapons and to reduce their\r\nflow to conflict areas. The conclusions reached by the\r\nUnited Nations Panel of Governmental Experts on Small\r\nArms lay the foundation for future action by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nOn 18 September 1997, the Oslo Diplomatic\r\nConference adopted the Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction. The Convention\r\nis a clear and total ban on anti-personnel mines and\r\nestablishes a compelling new international norm against this\r\nscourge which has for so long afflicted humanity, especially\r\ninnocent civilians, mostly women and children. South\r\nAfrica looks forward to the early entry into force of the\r\nConvention and appeals to all States to heed the call of the\r\ninternational community against these inhumane weapons.\r\nSouth Africa has often expressed grave concern at the\r\ninvolvement of its nationals in mercenary activities, because\r\nthese activities inhibit the achievement of peaceful\r\nsolutions to internal conflicts and destabilize regions.\r\nConsequently, we have drafted legislation to regulate the\r\nrendering of military assistance by private individuals and\r\ncompanies to foreign Governments and agencies.\r\nThe South African Government puts a high premium\r\non the promotion and protection of human rights as a\r\ncornerstone of its foreign policy. As we approach the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights and the thirtieth of the International Year\r\nfor Human Rights, we reaffirm our commitment to the\r\npreeminent values of basic human dignity, values for\r\nwhich we have fought and for which we must continue to\r\nfight. Our peoples deserve no less. In this context, my\r\ndelegation supports the recommendation to convene a\r\nworld conference on racism and racial discrimination,\r\nxenophobia and related intolerance.\r\nMy Government remains committed to addressing\r\ngender inequities. The worst manifestations of these\r\nunequal gender relations are the acts of violence\r\ncommitted against women and girls. My Government has\r\npledged itself to preventing and combating this violence\r\nby, among other initiatives, aligning its legislation,\r\npolicies and strategies with international instruments such\r\nas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women.\r\nSouth Africa believes in the strengthening of the role\r\nof the United Nations in the promotion of international\r\ncooperation for economic and social development. To this\r\nend, we welcome those measures in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposed reform package which seek to\r\nstrengthen the capacity of the United Nations and to\r\nrevitalize its role in the context of development.\r\nThe adoption of the Agenda for Development by the\r\nGeneral Assembly was a milestone in our collective\r\nsearch for a meaningful global partnership for\r\ndevelopment. That the membership could reach agreement\r\non so complex a matter is testimony to the seriousness\r\nwith which States view the issue, and to the dynamics of\r\nconsensus-building in fostering a global partnership.\r\nMember States should act to implement the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment in a coordinated manner, by creating\r\ndynamic structures susceptible of successful delivery.\r\nSouth Africa remains committed to an action-\r\norientated Agenda for Development which gives priority\r\nto international cooperation for development. Partnerships\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nfor development, as envisaged also in the Midrand\r\nMinisterial Declaration and Partnership for Growth and\r\nDevelopment, should be established to ensure effective\r\ndelivery of assistance to the developing world.\r\nThe problems of abject poverty and social deprivation\r\ncontinue to afflict and haunt many countries, particularly in\r\nthe developing world. In order to address this scourge,\r\nwhich affects least-developed countries in particular,\r\neffective and consistent measures need to be undertaken\r\nwithin the context of the United Nations Decade for the\r\nEradication of Poverty.\r\nThe issue of external indebtedness continues to\r\nfrustrate the ability of the least-developed countries to\r\npromote economic and social development. It is therefore\r\nincumbent upon the international community to address and\r\nfind a solution to this problem as a matter of urgency.\r\nOne year after the conclusion of the mid-term review\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s, we need to take stock and review\r\nprogress to see if the requisite resource mobilization levels\r\nare anywhere near being met and whether the central\r\ndevelopment goals are in place. As with the mid-term\r\nreview of the New Agenda, this would enable the\r\ninternational community to take urgent and practical action\r\non behalf of the African continent to eradicate poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nWe in southern Africa, as a region whose potential for\r\ndevelopment was hamstrung by the repressive policies of\r\napartheid, cannot but seek the promotion of our people\r\nthrough cooperation. It follows therefore that we should be\r\ncommitted to the transformation of our Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community into an institution which provides\r\na framework for the promotion of the imperatives of\r\nreconstruction and development. This would enhance the\r\ndegree to which, individually and collectively, the region\r\noffers a basis to ensure a better life for all our peoples.\r\nThe global partnership for sustainable development\r\nwill be enhanced through the transfer of essential and\r\nenvironmentally sound technologies to developing States on\r\npreferential and concessional terms. The financial resources\r\nand mechanisms necessary for the implementation of\r\nAgenda 21 are still inadequate. Developed countries should\r\nhonour their commitment to raise official development\r\nassistance flows to the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross domestic product. Those few countries which have\r\nachieved this objective are commended.\r\nWe encourage the promotion and sustainable\r\nmanagement of the global environment to ensure a higher\r\nquality of life for all. The objective of sustainable\r\ndevelopment should be the integration of environmental,\r\neconomic and social policies in order to meet basic\r\nhuman needs and to manage the environment on a\r\nsustainable basis.\r\nThe disappointing lack of consensus at the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on the environment held\r\nin June 1997 leaves considerable follow-up action to be\r\nundertaken in order to accelerate the implementation of\r\nAgenda 21. In this respect, the role and importance of the\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme as one of the\r\nleading United Nations bodies in the field of the\r\nenvironment should be strengthened.\r\nWe commend the decision to convene a special\r\nsession on drugs to deal effectively with the illicit\r\nproduction, sale, demand, trafficking and distribution of\r\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The special\r\nsession will offer Member States an opportunity to join\r\ntheir efforts to combat drug abuse and illicit trafficking.\r\nSouth Africa strongly favours the early establishment\r\nof a permanent, independent and effective international\r\ncriminal court. An opportunity now exists to establish the\r\ncourt before the turn of the century. We must therefore\r\nredouble our efforts during the forthcoming sessions of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee to ensure that the diplomatic\r\nconference in Rome can complete its work successfully.\r\nIt is imperative that all Member States continue fully\r\nto support the international criminal tribunals for Rwanda\r\nand the former Yugoslavia. To this end, my Government,\r\nin collaboration with the Parliamentarians for Global\r\nAction, recently hosted an international workshop on\r\nsecuring State cooperation and compliance with the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Its purpose\r\nwas to review cooperation with the Rwanda Tribunal and\r\nencourage the enactment of domestic legislation by\r\nMember States, thus ensuring that those accused of acts\r\nof genocide are swiftly brought to trial.\r\nMy Government welcomes efforts to elaborate a\r\ndraft convention to define terrorism. It is our belief that\r\nacts of terrorism must be clearly distinguished from\r\nnational liberation struggles in pursuit of the right to self-\r\ndetermination by peoples subjected to foreign or colonial\r\ndomination.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to announce to\r\nthe Assembly that on 20 August 1997, the South African\r\nCabinet approved ratification of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. South Africa, a country\r\nwith considerable maritime interests, will, for its part,\r\ncontinue to play a meaningful and constructive role in the\r\ngovernance of the world’s oceans.\r\nThe continuing financial crisis of the Organization is\r\nof great concern to my delegation. We fully support the\r\nSecretary-General’s commitment to ending the long and\r\npersistent near-bankruptcy of the Organization. It behoves\r\nMember States to discharge their Charter obligation by\r\npaying their contributions in full, on time and without\r\nconditions.\r\nThe lofty ideals that brought us together should\r\ncontinue to serve as an inspiration for us to strengthen the\r\nauthority and capacity of the United Nations as we move\r\ninto the next millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nCzech Republic, His Excellency Mr. Josef Zieleniec.\r\nMr. Zieleniec (Czech Republic): At the outset, may I\r\ncongratulate Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on his election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly and wish him much success in this important and\r\nresponsible function. I should also like to use this\r\nopportunity to thank his predecessor, Ambassador Razali\r\nIsmail, who, with his typical energetic approach,\r\ncontributed greatly to the success of the fifty-first session.\r\nThe recently concluded fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly can certainly be described without\r\nexaggeration as one of the key periods in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations. The important reform proposals submitted\r\nduring its course will, if carried out, result in the most\r\nfundamental change in the structure and activities of the\r\nUnited Nations since its foundation. We strongly believe\r\nthat the Organization will emerge from the reform process\r\nreinforced and that this process will increase the importance\r\nof the United Nations as a global forum that focuses on the\r\nserious problems facing our world today, open to all who\r\nwish and are willing to take part.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the vigour and vision with\r\nwhich the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\r\ncommitted himself to the reform efforts. We support the\r\nmeasures he has already taken to make the work of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat more effective as well as the\r\npackage of recommendations he submitted to the General\r\nAssembly last July. Whether or not these concrete and\r\neffective reform steps are really put into effect now\r\ndepends on the political will of the Member States. The\r\nCzech Republic will make every effort to be most\r\ncooperative in this respect.\r\nWe are glad that the reform efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral have met with a favourable response on the part\r\nof the Member States. His proposals have been supported\r\nalso by the 16 Heads of State and Government associated\r\nin the Carlsson Group, of which Czech President Václav\r\nHavel is also a member. As this Group stated in its\r\ndeclaration of 10 August 1997 on the Secretary-General’s\r\nreform proposals, the United Nations has a chance to take\r\na step forward, and this chance should not be missed.\r\nAs for restructuring the Security Council, the Czech\r\nRepublic prefers the expansion of both Council-member\r\ncategories while preserving the Council’s effectiveness\r\nand flexibility. We continue to support an increase in the\r\nnumber of permanent members to include Germany,\r\nJapan and three other countries representing Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America. My country also advocates expansion\r\nof the category of non-permanent seats, including one seat\r\nfor the Group of Eastern European States.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should also\r\nresult in improving and simplifying the Council’s working\r\nmethods. My country has actively participated in\r\ndiscussions of this question and has submitted a proposal\r\nfor a broader interpretation of Article 31 of the United\r\nNations Charter. We are pleased that our proposal has\r\nbeen backed by a number of Member States and believe\r\nit will become part of the working methods of the\r\nreformed Security Council.\r\nIt is quite unthinkable to restructure the United\r\nNations without changing its present system of financing.\r\nIn order to make cost-sharing more equitable it is\r\nnecessary to change the existing scale of assessments. The\r\nnew system of contributions to the regular budget and to\r\npeacekeeping operations should reflect the real economic\r\ncapacity of individual Member States. All Member States,\r\nwithout exception, should also duly comply with their\r\nfinancial obligations.\r\nFor my country, this year is a year of important\r\nevents. The invitation extended at the Madrid Summit to\r\nthree Central European countries, including the Czech\r\nRepublic, to open talks on accession to the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO), is a key and historic\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\ndecision which we regard not as a first and last step, but,\r\nrather, as the beginning of the process of NATO\r\nenlargement. The Czech Republic is convinced that the\r\nalliance will in the future invite some other democratic\r\ncountries. The signing of the Founding Act on Mutual\r\nRelations, Cooperation and Security between the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization and the Russian Federation\r\nconstitutes an important step towards the strengthening of\r\nEuropean security.\r\nThe Czech Republic has noted with satisfaction that\r\nthe effort of the European Union to further enhance the\r\nintegration process achieved concrete results at the\r\nIntergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam. We\r\nwelcomed the European Commission’s positive assessment\r\nof the Czech Republic as a candidate for European Union\r\nmembership. We believe that negotiations with the Czech\r\nRepublic and other candidates for membership can start in\r\nthe early months of 1998.\r\nOne of the basic prerequisites for a country’s stability\r\nis harmonious relations with its neighbours. This is why we\r\nattach great importance to the Czech-German declaration on\r\nmutual relations and their future development, signed in\r\nPrague in January of this year. By signing this document\r\nthe two sides confirmed their political will to further\r\nintensify all-round bilateral cooperation as an expression of\r\ntheir determination to work jointly on shaping a peaceful\r\nfuture in Europe. In fact, this joint determination and\r\npolitical will is already being transformed into concrete\r\nsteps in different areas.\r\nWe are very sensitive to the political problems of our\r\npresent world, and, within our capacities, participate in their\r\nsolution. One of the most complicated issues is undoubtedly\r\nthe conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and particularly in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We support the peace process\r\nbased on the Dayton Peace Accords and on the London\r\nProgramme of Action, and consider them the best possible\r\nsolution to the protracted conflict. It is beyond dispute that\r\none key prerequisite for the success of the peace process is\r\nthe just punishment of all war crimes committed during the\r\nconflict.\r\nWe also focus our attention on the situation in the\r\nMiddle East, the region currently being visited by President\r\nHavel. The peace process is now in a difficult phase, but its\r\nrole is irreplaceable. We hope, however, that bilateral talks\r\nbetween the State of Israel and its neighbours will lead to\r\ngreater stability in the region and eventually result in just\r\nand lasting peace for all.\r\nThe Czech Republic follows with much concern the\r\nsecurity and humanitarian situation in certain African\r\ncountries, in particular in the Great Lakes region, but also\r\nin Somalia and Sierra Leone. We fully support the efforts\r\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\r\nUnity aimed at putting an end to unrest, wars and\r\nsuffering in Africa. Positive changes taking place in\r\nLiberia, for example, fill us with optimism. We believe\r\nthat the work done by our own military observers in the\r\noperations of the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nLiberia has also contributed to this progress.\r\nMy country wishes to continue to participate in\r\nbuilding a global security architecture. Within the United\r\nNations we want to work actively, mainly in the fields of\r\npeacekeeping operations, arms control and disarmament.\r\nOur military observers, doctors and other medical\r\npersonnel participate in a number of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. A Czech Army battalion has\r\nbeen operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina under NATO\r\ncommand within the multinational Stabilization Force, on\r\nthe basis of the Security Council mandate. It has been\r\nperforming its tasks well, and we are pleased that its\r\nactivities are being viewed positively.\r\nThe inclusion of the Czech Republic at the\r\nbeginning of this year in the Special Committee on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations is both a sign of appreciation of\r\nour activities in this field and a manifestation of our\r\ncommitment to participate further in peacekeeping\r\noperations and to improve the level of our participation.\r\nThe Czech Republic has been actively participating\r\nin the field of arms control and disarmament. As a non-\r\nnuclear-weapon State, we are naturally interested in\r\nattaining universality of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its strict\r\nobservance, which, we expect, will lead to the further\r\nreduction of nuclear proliferation and will advance the\r\nlong-term objective of nuclear disarmament. We attach\r\ngreat importance to the sessions of the preparatory\r\ncommittees, and expect that their positive suggestions\r\ncould set the tone of the Review Conference to be held in\r\nthe year 2000 towards reinforcing the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty.\r\nThe Czech Republic has from the very beginning\r\nvoiced support for the idea of strengthening the\r\ninternational safeguards system of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency within the so-called 93 +2\r\nProgramme. It was within these efforts that the Czech\r\nRepublic only a few days ago officially informed the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency’s secretariat of its\r\ninterest in concluding a supplementary protocol to the\r\nsafeguards agreement between the Czech Republic and the\r\nAgency, as required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\r\nThe majority of Member States of the United Nations\r\nlast year signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty, and I am pleased to state that my country was one\r\nof the first to ratify it.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. We expect it to\r\neffectively control and carry out the verification process, in\r\nwhich we are prepared to participate fully.\r\nWe are convinced that the Biological Weapons\r\nConvention needs more effective control mechanisms. To\r\nthis end, Czech experts are actively participating in talks on\r\nfinalizing the verification protocol, which will considerably\r\nstrengthen this Convention.\r\nIn the field of conventional weapons, the Czech\r\nRepublic supports all measures contributing to greater\r\ntransparency, and has been systematically fulfilling all its\r\nobligations concerning notification to the respective\r\nregisters. At this year’s Brussels Conference on anti-\r\npersonnel land mines, the Czech Republic joined the so-\r\ncalled Ottawa process, and it is prepared to sign in Ottawa\r\nearly in December a convention on the complete ban of\r\nsuch weapons.\r\nIt has been an honour for my country to chair two\r\nimportant United Nations bodies this year. The Economic\r\nand Social Council plays a very important role in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation in the economic and social fields.\r\nIts reform is therefore very important. The Czech Republic\r\nhas always stressed the need for better coordination,\r\neffectiveness and simplification of the Council’s structure\r\nand activities. We also believe that when chairing the\r\nCouncil we have helped shape its new image. We noted\r\npromising signs of this new image already during its\r\nsubstantive session in July. One example was the high-level\r\nsegment with participation of ministers and senior\r\ngovernment officials, which proved the growing interest of\r\nthe Member States in discussions on specific subjects. An\r\ninformal political dialogue with representatives of United\r\nNations funds and agencies also proved the Council’s\r\nability to serve as a platform for useful and fruitful\r\nexchanges of views. The reform and strengthening of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council should continue. In this\r\nrespect, we welcome all steps taken to implement resolution\r\n50/227, and above all to further simplify the structure of\r\nthe Council’s subsidiary bodies.\r\nIn its priorities, the Czech Republic pays great\r\nattention to the protection of human rights as one of the\r\nnecessary conditions for free development of human\r\nsociety and democracy. We had the honour to chair the\r\nCommission on Human Rights in the first year of our\r\nmembership in this important body. On the basis of this\r\nexperience, the Czech Republic has been urging the\r\nelimination of factors negatively influencing the work of\r\nthe Commission, and has been seeking new approaches\r\nand methods of dealing with individual cases of flagrant\r\nviolation of human rights.\r\nNext year the international community will\r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We hope that\r\nthis event will be an occasion not merely for ceremonial\r\nassemblies and declarations, but for presenting concrete\r\nresults of work in the field of human rights.\r\nMy country supports all efforts aimed at early\r\nestablishment of an International Criminal Court, which\r\nwould create a new system for punishing the most serious\r\ncrimes of human rights violations and violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law. The need for such an\r\ninstitution is acute, and the Czech Republic fully supports\r\nthe convocation of a diplomatic conference in 1998 to\r\nadopt and open to signature the convention on the\r\nestablishment of the court.\r\nOne of the burning scourges of our world today is\r\nthe growth of international organized crime and the\r\nrelated problem of drug abuse. This global problem can\r\nbe solved effectively only through close international\r\ncooperation. We believe that the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 1998 will stimulate the\r\nstrengthening of this cooperation.\r\nAnother threat hanging over the world is\r\ninternational terrorism. This is a threat which can be\r\nneutralized only by the tough and uncompromising\r\nattitude of the international community and by effective\r\ninternational cooperation. Every country sincerely\r\ninterested in security throughout the world must strictly\r\nobserve and comply with commitments arising from\r\nrelevant international instruments. The Czech Republic\r\nsupports every effort aimed at the elaboration of an\r\ninternational convention for the suppression of terrorist\r\nbombings. In this respect, my country has also actively\r\nparticipated in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee set up\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nto deal with this problem and believes that the current\r\nsession of experts will make further progress in the\r\nfinalization of the draft convention so that it may be\r\nadopted and opened to signature as soon as possible.\r\nOne of the most dynamically developing spheres of\r\ninternational and global cooperation is that of environment\r\nand sustainable development. The United Nations has been\r\ntraditionally working hard in this field. The key,\r\nirreplaceable role in this field is played by the United\r\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United\r\nNations Commission on Sustainable Development. It seems\r\nthat UNEP is already on the way out of crisis, although not\r\nall the problems are solved by any means. The recent\r\nestablishment of the high-level committee is undoubtedly a\r\nstep towards improvement of the governing structure of\r\nUNEP and towards stabilization of its programme and\r\nbudget. In a short time we expect the strengthened UNEP\r\nto start a new endeavour to fulfil its mandate.\r\nThe process of follow-up activities of the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development was\r\ngiven a new and strong impulse at the nineteenth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The results of this special\r\nsession were not unambiguously positive. On the one hand,\r\nwe welcome the wide support for the promotion of\r\nsustainable development and for efforts of Governments\r\nand international organizations, further strengthened by\r\ncomplementary activities of non-governmental\r\norganizations, national Governments, entrepreneurial circles\r\nand other interest groups. On the other hand, however, the\r\nsession proved that not all of them are prepared to take\r\nresolute steps towards achieving sustainable development.\r\nThe tasks facing the United Nations in the next period\r\nare numerous and difficult. However, they have been\r\nclearly outlined and can be fulfilled. It also depends on us,\r\nMember States, whether and how we will cope with them.\r\nIt is the results of our joint efforts that will decide not only\r\nthe fate of the world Organization but also of the world\r\nitself on the threshold of the next millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to appeal to the\r\nparticipants in the general debate to respect as much as\r\npossible the estimated speaking time they have provided to\r\nthe Secretariat. This would greatly facilitate the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Georgia, His Excellency Mr. Irakli\r\nMenagarishvili.\r\nMr. Menagarishvili (Georgia) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): I should like to begin by congratulating the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko, on his election as President of General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-second session. This is a compelling\r\nacknowledgment of the high international esteem in which\r\nUkraine is held and of Mr. Udovenko’s personal qualities\r\nand extensive experience. At the same time, I should like\r\nto express gratitude to the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-first session, Ambassador Razali\r\nIsmail, who made a significant contribution to the\r\nsuccessful guidance of that session.\r\nIt is particularly important for us to be making this\r\nstatement today from this lofty rostrum. Five years have\r\npassed since Georgia became a full-fledged Member of\r\nthe United Nations. I believe that the time has come to\r\nassess the development of Georgian statehood, as well as\r\nthe results of our full-fledged participation in and active\r\ncooperation with the United Nations.\r\nIn this five-year period our country has travelled\r\nfrom civil war, chaos, economic collapse and rampant\r\ncrimes to ever increasing stability, the establishment of\r\ndemocratic institutions and tangible economic progress.\r\nThe fact that we have been able to emerge with dignity\r\nfrom the most critical phase in our independent\r\ndevelopment is, to a large extent, to the credit of the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, which\r\nprovided Georgia not only with moral support but with\r\nspecific and timely financial and technical assistance. We\r\nshall always remember that with particular gratitude.\r\nWe understand what a responsible task the United\r\nNations has as it\r\n“strives to articulate an inclusive vision: community\r\namong nations, common humanity among peoples,\r\nthe singularity of our only one Earth.” (A/51/950,\r\npara. 1)\r\nThe criterion for the formation of such a vision is the\r\ndestiny of each people and every State, including Georgia,\r\nwhose recent history fully and clearly reflects all the\r\nvirtues and flaws of the present world order. Georgia can\r\nthus serve as a model with regard to the need to\r\nimplement long-awaited changes and radical reforms\r\nwithin the United Nations system. It is precisely on this\r\nsubject that I wish to share my views.\r\nThe global post-confrontational development\r\nfollowing the end of cold war has not, unfortunately, been\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nas simple as had been expected. We have stressed on\r\nnumerous occasions, including from this rostrum, that the\r\nglobal confrontation between two systems has given way to\r\nequally dangerous local and intra-State conflicts that carry\r\nwithin them the potential for enormous destruction, thereby\r\nposing the same global challenge to international security.\r\nOne of the manifestations of this dangerous trend is the\r\naggressive separatism that has plagued my country and\r\nseveral other newly independent States. We have also\r\npointed out that the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations should act in a manner that takes account of\r\nthese changes. Unfortunately, our recent experience shows\r\nthat, as a result of somewhat entrenched attitudes, these\r\nrealities are frequently misunderstood.\r\nThe main obstacle to the strengthening and\r\ndevelopment of our statehood and to the full\r\nimplementation of economic reforms continues to be the\r\nlack of a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia and the\r\nTskhinvali region. The situation in Abkhazia is particularly\r\nworrying. About 300,000 refugees and displaced persons\r\nfrom Abkhazia are still unable to return to their homes.\r\nThese people, whom fate has not treated kindly, are already\r\nbeginning to lose hope for a peaceful settlement of the\r\nconflict. We are obliged to note that, regrettably, the\r\nconflict in Abkhazia has become a kind of touchstone\r\nexposing the inadequacy of United Nations efforts. We\r\ntherefore continue to insist on the need to find a new\r\napproach that can give a new impetus to the dialogue. We\r\nwelcome the vigorous steps being taken to strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations in settling the conflict in\r\nAbkhazia, Georgia.\r\nWe have embraced with hope and optimism the new\r\ninitiatives put forward by the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations. We would like to stress in particular that\r\nwe attach importance to the resumption of the Geneva\r\nnegotiations between the parties to the conflict, under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations and with the participation of\r\nthe Russian Federation as facilitator, the group of Friends\r\nof the Secretary-General on Georgia and the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We are\r\nconfident that the Geneva process will not only promote a\r\nsettlement of the conflict, but will also reveal the\r\ntransformational role that the United Nations can play under\r\nthe new conditions. Here I must express deep gratitude to\r\nthe President of Ukraine, His Excellency Mr. Leonid\r\nKuchma, who, from this lofty rostrum expressed support for\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations in Abkhazia and\r\nreaffirmed Ukraine’s readiness to participate directly.\r\nThe establishment of a United Nations standby force\r\nwould be very useful in developing the potential for\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations to prevent the\r\nescalation of conflicts in a timely manner. Such forces\r\nwould be on constant standby. We believe that such a\r\nsystem must include a technically well-equipped and\r\nappropriately staffed headquarters. It would be responsible\r\nfor the evaluation and assessment of emerging conflict\r\nsituations. On the basis of such assessments United\r\nNations rapid-reaction forces, which have yet to be\r\nestablished, could be quickly sent to zones of conflict. We\r\nare confident that, had such forces existed five years ago,\r\nthe tragic development of the conflict in Abkhazia could\r\nhave been prevented. As the vicissitudes of the conflict in\r\nAbkhazia, Georgia, have shown, there is still a need for\r\nclearly coordinated joint actions between the United\r\nNations and regional and international organizations for\r\nthe settlement of conflicts. The absence of such a practice\r\nconsiderably reduces the effectiveness of the\r\npeacekeeping efforts of our community.\r\nGeorgia’s experience provides a positive example of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nThis cooperation includes the joint United Nations-OSCE\r\noffice for monitoring human rights in Abkhazia and the\r\nprogramme for the economic rehabilitation of the\r\nTskhinvali region, proposed and implemented by the\r\nUnited Nations Development Program. I also believe that\r\nwe should seriously consider the proposal of the acting\r\nChairman of the OSCE, by which the State chairing that\r\nOrganization would automatically join the group of\r\nFriends of the Secretary-General on Georgia, thereby\r\npromoting and increasing cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OSCE. We believe that there is a need to\r\nwelcome the process of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional international organizations, which\r\nhas already begun.\r\nWe should also reconsider the important concept of\r\npost-conflict peace-building. We are sometimes prisoners\r\nof stereotyped notions of a phased approach to settling\r\nconflicts, and as a result we sometimes fail to notice how\r\nthin the line is between establishing peace and\r\npeacekeeping itself. In the process of conflict settlement\r\nit is more effective to use elements of post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding, including them in the strategy of peacekeeping\r\noperations. Elements of post-conflict peace-building such\r\nas social and economic rehabilitation of conflict zones\r\nand the establishment of a basis for their further\r\ndevelopment would facilitate confidence-building between\r\nthe parties involved and create a favourable social and\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\neconomic environment for the achievement of a final\r\npolitical settlement. We believe that the United Nations\r\nshould remain actively seized of this matter.\r\nThe creation of a special fund would allow the United\r\nNations potential for post-conflict peace-building to be\r\nstrengthened. “Development dividends” could provide one\r\nsource of revenue for this. On the other hand, the fund\r\ncould also consider the economic interests of the parties to\r\nthe conflict, and on that basis develop relevant projects,\r\nthereby assisting in conflict prevention.\r\nThe uniqueness and indispensability of the United\r\nNations as a central and multilateral mechanism of\r\ncooperation in the post-confrontational world must first and\r\nforemost be manifested in its leading role in the creation of\r\na qualitatively new comprehensive system of security,\r\nstability and development. The most important role here\r\nmust be played by a global system of economic security,\r\nthe formation of which should run parallel with the\r\ndevelopment of the process of world integration.\r\nA characteristic feature of today’s world is that\r\nformerly isolated historico-geographic regions are gradually\r\novercoming their isolation and are cooperating to create a\r\nshared global infrastructure of human activities. Therefore,\r\nregional economic unions should be viewed as a driving\r\nforce of the mechanisms for building such an infrastructure.\r\nFor example, the Caucasus region clearly demonstrates\r\nthe potential of the so-called graded model of global\r\nintegration. I refer, in the first place, to subregional\r\ncooperation within the framework of a given region and,\r\nfurther, in the light of the geo-strategic situation of the\r\nCaucasus, to its role as a link for interregional cooperation,\r\nnamely between Europe and Asia.\r\nSuch a structure for integration, such a global model\r\nis in keeping with the realities of our day. We believe that\r\nthe coordinating role of the United Nations in this process\r\ncan be very effective.\r\nSuch a vision of the role of the Caucasus region has\r\nalready been embodied in the concept of the Euro-Asian\r\ncorridor, a kind of Silk Road for the twenty-first century.\r\nThis historic conduit for trade, the importance of which is\r\ncontinuing to grow and gain in recognition, is already\r\nworking and proving its effectiveness.\r\nSimilar corridors present a unique opportunity for the\r\nestablishment of new material and cultural values and for\r\nbringing economies and cultures together. On this basis,\r\nthey must — and, unquestionably, will — also play an\r\nimportant role in the establishment and strengthening of\r\nstability in the region.\r\nGeorgia has been called upon to actively promote\r\nthe implementation of this concept. Even a superficial\r\nglance at a map shows the strategic importance of\r\ngeopolitical and geo-economic dimensions of this central\r\nconduit for world trade. Therefore, we express our\r\nreadiness to cooperate with all those who are interested in\r\nmaking it a reality.\r\nThe broad functions of the United Nations as a\r\nuniversal organization are the basis for the initiatives\r\nspelled out by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report\r\n“Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for\r\nReform”. First and foremost, we believe there is a need\r\nto focus on the treaty defining the international legal\r\nprofile of today’s world order: the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Conceived under specific circumstances, it\r\nprovided a mechanism that was aimed, for the most part,\r\nat prevention and settlement of conflicts between States.\r\nAs a result, the United Nations has often reacted\r\ninadequately to such challenges as the numerous conflicts\r\noccurring within States. The principles that constituted the\r\nbasis for traditional peacekeeping operations, in particular\r\nthe concept of consent of the parties, are often untenable\r\nin cases of so-called ethnic conflict. This leads us to the\r\nidea that the Charter to a great extent needs to be\r\nrethought and made to conform to current realities.\r\nIn this regard, Georgia supports the creation of a\r\nministerial commission to study the necessity of\r\nfundamental reforms in the Charter and in those legal\r\ndocuments that define the mandates of the United Nations\r\nspecialized agencies. Georgia also supports the proposal\r\nfor the appointment of a First Under-Secretary-General\r\nwho would be called upon to play a special role in\r\nensuring the success of programmes and plans of the\r\nvarious functional sectors of the Secretariat.\r\nUndoubtedly, the crux of the United Nations reforms\r\nis the enlargement of the Security Council and the\r\nimprovement of the activities of the General Assembly\r\nand of the other main bodies. Also important is the\r\nquestion of the optimal reallocation of authority between\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council. In this\r\nrespect, we reaffirm our unwavering position concerning\r\nthe inclusion of Germany and Japan among the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council and also concerning the\r\nenlargement of the Council, including adding one seat for\r\nthe Eastern European countries.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nWe favour growing transparency in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. From our point of view, it is important\r\nthat concerned States be able to participate in informal\r\nconsultations of the Council, at which substantive\r\ndiscussions take place and decisions are taken.\r\nThe international community should also be equipped\r\nwith reliable tools of justice to enable it to react not only to\r\nunlawful actions of States but also to those of individuals\r\nwho have perpetrated crimes against humanity. In this\r\nconnection, we call upon all the Member States to do all\r\nthey can to conclude successfully the diplomatic conference\r\nand to adopt a treaty on the establishment of an\r\ninternational criminal court by 1998.\r\nIn closing I would like to recall the initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General to hold a special session of the General\r\nAssembly in the year 2000, as a “millennium Assembly”.\r\nVery little time remains before mankind enters the new\r\nmillennium, and we must do everything we can to see to\r\nthat the reformed United Nations becomes a genuinely new\r\nUnited Nations for the world order of the coming century.\r\nI am confident that Georgia, together with other States, will\r\noccupy a worthy place in it, as a democratic and prosperous\r\ncountry.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nHis Excellency Dr. Kamal Kharrazi.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran) (spoke in\r\nPersian; English text furnished by the delegation): Allow\r\nme to express my felicitations to the President on his\r\nelection and express the confidence that, with his wisdom\r\nand diplomatic skill, he will ably guide the fifty-second\r\nGeneral Assembly towards tangible results. Let me also\r\nexpress my appreciation to his predecessor for his excellent\r\nwork.\r\nDue to lateness of the hour, I will present a brief\r\nversion of my statement. The complete text will be\r\ndistributed.\r\nAt the threshold of the third millennium and under the\r\ncircumstances of unfolding interplay among not one or two\r\nbut various powers in the shaping of new global decisions,\r\ninternational relations need a new doctrine, commensurate\r\nwith the evolving conditions and emerging needs. The main\r\nobjective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a\r\nglobal civil society, a society where liberty and salvation\r\nharmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material\r\nneeds of humanity in an institutionalized manner, and\r\nwhere comprehensive, balanced and sustainable\r\ndevelopment lies at the foundation of universal\r\ncooperation and participation.\r\nThe doctrine of global civil society is predicated on\r\ntwo major principles, the first being the\r\ninstitutionalization of the rule of law in domestic and\r\ninternational relations. The international community today,\r\nlike its constituent Member States, simply cannot provide\r\na peaceful and prosperous life for people through\r\ncoercion, autocratic decisions and a cultural domination\r\nand hegemony. Therefore, the rule of law, as the very\r\nfoundation of order and the relations among individuals\r\nand States, should be institutionalized.\r\nThe second major principle is that of empowerment\r\nand participation. Similar to the process of participation\r\nat the national level — where all individuals, regardless\r\nof colour, race, opinion, wealth or social status have an\r\ninalienable right to determine their own destiny —\r\ncountries and regions with differing cultures and resources\r\nshould enjoy the right and be empowered to participate at\r\nall stages of decision-making and policy implementation\r\nat the global scale.\r\nToday, North and South constitute two\r\ncomplementary domains in a single global arena.\r\nEquilibrium and stability of the future world order\r\ndepend, in large measure, on the South’s contribution to\r\nthe shaping of the norms governing future international\r\nrelations.\r\nIn our view, we can move towards the gradual\r\nrealization of a global civil society through\r\ninstitutionalization of these two fundamental principles\r\nand by committing ourselves to pluralism, tolerance,\r\ndialogue among civilizations, promotion of human rights,\r\ncomprehensive, balanced and sustainable development,\r\njustice and equality of opportunities as the governing\r\nnorms in our interactions.\r\nThe political philosophy of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran is in full accord with these fundamental foundations\r\nof the prospective global civil society. The domestic\r\nprogramme of the new administration is geared towards\r\nstrengthening the foundations of civil society.\r\nThe main features and priorities of the new\r\nadministration’s foreign policy include the following: the\r\nexpansion of relations with all countries on the basis of\r\nmutual respect, common interest and non-interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of others; emphasis on the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\ninstitutionalization of international law as the foundation of\r\nglobal order and as the final arbiter among States; the\r\nestablishment and strengthening of mechanisms of mutual\r\nconfidence-building and security through regional\r\ncooperation and the negation of the presence and influence\r\nof foreign powers; the protection of all human rights and\r\nthe rejection of attempts at selective and discriminatory\r\nabuse of human rights as instruments of policy; emphasis\r\non the fundamental rights of oppressed individuals and\r\nnations, particularly the Palestinian people; the arresting of\r\nthe arms race at the regional and global levels, the\r\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction and the control\r\nof conventional weapons; the strengthening of the bonds of\r\namity and solidarity among Islamic and non-aligned\r\ncountries; an active presence and constructive participation\r\nin the United Nations and other international organizations,\r\nwith an effective contribution in international efforts on\r\nglobal issues such as arms control and disarmament,\r\ncomprehensive and sustainable development, human rights,\r\npeacekeeping and combating terrorism and illicit drugs, as\r\nwell as the reversal of unjust international arrangements;\r\nand, finally, defending the rights of Iranian citizens all over\r\nthe world.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has adopted concrete\r\nmeasures at the regional and international levels in pursuit\r\nof these principled policies, and it is fully prepared to\r\ncooperate with all countries towards achieving common\r\nobjectives in accordance with the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nThe question of Palestine, which lies at the very heart\r\nof the Middle East crisis, represents the most vivid and\r\npersistent case of disregard for international law and the\r\nsystematic violation of fundamental human rights of\r\nindividuals and peoples. The Middle East crisis can be\r\nsolved only through the full realization of the rights of the\r\nPalestinian people, in particular their right to self-\r\ndetermination, the return of refugees and the liberation of\r\nall occupied territories, including Al-Quds al-Sharif,\r\nsouthern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan. The experience of\r\nthe past few years has made it abundantly clear that any\r\nscheme or proposal which fails to take into full account the\r\nrealities in the region or the infamous Israeli patterns of\r\nbehaviour is bound to fail.\r\nIt is indeed unfortunate that some outside powers\r\ndeliberately misconstrue or misrepresent Iran’s frank, open\r\nand objective exposé of the realities as support for terrorism\r\nand as opposition to peace and security in the region. I\r\nreiterate once again that the Islamic Republic of Iran also\r\nseeks peace and stability in the Middle East — a just and\r\nlasting peace that would receive regional consensus and\r\nthat would cure this chronic crisis once and for all.\r\nOur region has witnessed for nearly two decades the\r\ncrisis in Afghanistan. There is, undoubtedly, no military\r\nsolution to this tragedy; yet some warring factions have\r\nyet to realize this evident truth. Only through the\r\nestablishment of a ceasefire, the cessation of foreign\r\nintervention, negotiations between all Afghan groups and\r\nthe formation of a broad-based Government representing\r\nall Afghans can the crisis in Afghanistan find a lasting\r\nsolution. My Government is determined to continue its\r\nhumanitarian and peacemaking endeavours in Afghanistan\r\nin tandem with the United Nations Secretary-General and\r\nthe Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference. I must draw the attention of the international\r\ncommunity to the dire need for and the urgency of\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.\r\nThe cold war generated a tendency in internal and\r\nexternal relations which required the existence of a real or\r\nimagined enemy. Escaping this state of mind and building\r\na new world based on cooperation and the rule of law\r\nrequires not only political will, but careful planning in\r\norder to foster confidence and to mitigate economic,\r\nsecurity and social concerns at national and regional\r\nlevels.\r\nConfidence-building at national, regional and\r\ninternational levels, as an essential strategy to transform\r\nhuman relations, will not succeed in the absence of\r\ntransparency in decision-making and the participation of\r\nall concerned. The antithesis of universal participation in\r\ndecision-making and law-based cooperation at the\r\ninternational level is unilateralism. This phenomenon finds\r\nits manifestations in various areas, including arms control,\r\ndevelopment, international trade, the environment and\r\ncodification of new human rights norms.\r\nThe first and most effective step towards building\r\nconfidence is the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the reduction of conventional weapons,\r\ntransparency in the field of armaments and the\r\nestablishment of security and cooperation schemes in\r\nvarious regions of the globe. This endeavour requires the\r\nfull and non-discriminatory implementation of existing\r\nundertakings in the area of disarmament and security and\r\nthe development of new rules to address universally\r\naccepted priorities, as well as security requirements of the\r\ninternational community and its members.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, on the basis of Islamic\r\nprinciples, considers weapons of mass destruction inhumane\r\nand illegitimate. Officials of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) have repeatedly confirmed the fact\r\nthat Iran’s nuclear activities are performed within the\r\nframework of the Agency’s regulations and that they follow\r\npeaceful objectives. Despite these clear facts, some\r\nGovernments have embarked upon a barrage of false and\r\nbaseless accusations against Iran during the past few years.\r\nYet propaganda campaigns of public deception will\r\ncertainly not change regional realities on the ground. It is\r\nself-evident that the lack of security in the Middle East is\r\nrooted in Israel’s militarism and its arsenal of weapons of\r\nmass destruction, which have thwarted all disarmament\r\ninitiatives and mechanisms in the region.\r\nFurthermore, the unabated race for the acquisition of\r\nconventional weapons exacerbates the atmosphere of\r\nanxiety and mistrust. The foreign policy of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran is founded on peace, self-restraint,\r\nconfidence-building and the reduction and elimination of\r\ntension, particularly within our region. I wish to inform the\r\nAssembly frankly and sincerely that of all the countries of\r\nthe Middle East, Iran allocates the lowest percentage of its\r\nbudget to its military. In 1995 and 1996, only 3.3 per cent\r\nof our gross domestic product was spent on defence. We\r\ncontinue to be ready for any regionally acceptable\r\nunderstanding on further reductions in defence budgets such\r\nthat the security concerns of large and small countries alike\r\nare fully addressed.\r\nThe highest foreign policy priority of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran is to make every effort to strengthen trust\r\nand confidence and to build peace in our immediate\r\nneighbourhood, which in cases such as Tajikistan has\r\nachieved encouraging results. In our region, the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization has also contributed to the\r\nexpansion and consolidation of relations among its member\r\nStates through the adoption of common positions and by\r\nplaying an active role in the field of economic and technical\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn the Persian Gulf area, only cooperation and\r\ncollective participation can bring about security and stability\r\nfor all countries in the region. Taking full advantage of\r\nhistorical affinities, cultural ties and religious bonds and\r\nsparing no effort to utilize in an efficient and coordinated\r\nmanner the human and natural potential and resources of\r\nthe region constitute the single best long-term guarantee of\r\nsecurity and tranquillity. Iran — as the biggest country in\r\nthe region, enjoying a historical depth of several millennia\r\ncombined with the richness of Islamic civilization — does\r\nnot need to engage in any arms build-up or competition.\r\nOur message to our neighbours is one of friendship and\r\nfraternity, and we shall warmly welcome any initiative to\r\nstrengthen the foundations of confidence and cooperation\r\nin the region.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, which in December\r\nwill be hosting the eighth Islamic summit, is of the view\r\nthat on the threshold of the twenty-first century, the\r\nprimary task of the summit will be to foster mutual\r\nconfidence and establish mechanisms for cooperation and\r\ncoordination in various fields among Islamic countries.\r\nThis will undoubtedly contribute to the further\r\nstrengthening of the foundations of lasting international\r\nsecurity and stability.\r\nTerrorism is the wicked result of widespread\r\nlawlessness and the violent obstruction of public\r\nparticipation, which in its various forms and\r\nmanifestations threatens human societies at the national,\r\nregional and international levels. The political exploitation\r\nof this international problem, through hurling unfounded\r\nallegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or\r\ncover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy, is no\r\nless dangerous than terrorism itself. These two elements\r\ntogether diminish trust, stability and security at the\r\nregional and the international levels.\r\nResolution of this destructive problem requires a\r\ndetermined avoidance of sensationalism and demagoguery\r\non the one hand, and a concerted international attempt to\r\nfind practical measures to combat terrorism that are\r\nreasonable, objective and realistic on the other. More\r\nimportant, our collective success requires the non-\r\nselective, universal and law-based application of agreed\r\nmeasures by relevant international organizations.\r\nAs a country that has suffered immensely from the\r\ninhuman phenomenon of terrorism in the post-revolution\r\nyears, the Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared to take an\r\nactive part in any international effort to combat this\r\nproblem in a serious, comprehensive and principled\r\nmanner.\r\nThe resolution of complex international problems\r\nand the realization of post-cold-war opportunities require\r\nthe participation of all members of the international\r\ncommunity in the decision-making process, on the basis\r\nof the rules and principles of international law. The\r\nUnited Nations is the institutional embodiment of both\r\nuniversal participation and the rule of law on the global\r\nscale. It is the only universal organization which, with the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 22 September 1997\r\nhelp of an efficient and capable system, can move towards\r\nfinding solutions to the problems of human society and\r\nresponding to post-cold-war challenges. The magnitude of\r\nthis task clearly points to the need to improve the efficiency\r\nof the Organization and to enhance its role by embarking\r\non the transformation and reform of the major bodies,\r\nprogrammes and modes of operation of the Organization.\r\nI should like to express appreciation for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to reinvigorate the Organization, and to\r\nassure him of our earnest desire to cooperate with him in\r\nthe process of restructuring the United Nations into a more\r\nefficient, capable and reliable institution responsive to the\r\nneeds and views of all its Members. In our opinion, the\r\nextensive scope and implications of the measures envisaged\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report of 16 July make it\r\nimperative for the General Assembly to establish working\r\ngroups to examine the report thoroughly and in detail so\r\nthat the views of all Member States are identified and\r\ntaken into account.\r\nThere is no doubt that the current composition of the\r\nSecurity Council is remote from the state of international\r\naffairs today and is not acceptable to the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the international community. In our opinion,\r\nany increase in the membership of the Security Council\r\nor reform of its working methods will have to take the\r\ntrue role and concerns of the developing countries into\r\naccount. Moreover, reform of the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council should not be contingent upon resolution\r\nof the question of the increase in the membership of the\r\nCouncil; they are two distinct subjects and thus require\r\ntwo separate decisions.\r\nThe General Assembly is undoubtedly the highest\r\nand most representative organ of the United Nations,\r\nwhere all Members of the Organization enjoy an equal\r\nright to participate. This body, which comprises the entire\r\nmembership, certainly has the right — and indeed the\r\nresponsibility — to address each and every issue of global\r\nconcern, including in particular those relating to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nExpansion and broadening of the participatory base\r\nof the future global order on the basis of norms\r\nacceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive\r\nto building a better tomorrow, and to ensuring freedom,\r\nsecurity, stability and sustainable development at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels. The General\r\nAssembly, providing all Member States with the\r\nopportunity for full and equal participation in decision-\r\nmaking, is the most appropriate venue for dialogue,\r\nunderstanding and the adoption of coordinated\r\ninternational measures to build a better and a more\r\nequitable tomorrow.\r\nAs the new Government of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran assumes its responsibilities, I reiterate the willingness\r\nand full preparedness of my Government to take a\r\nconstructive part in this collective endeavour through\r\npromoting dialogue, understanding, trust and solidarity.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
