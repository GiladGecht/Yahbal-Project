(Ukraine)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Cde. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nCde. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His\r\nExcellency Cde. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Mugabe: On behalf of the States members\r\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), of which I am\r\nthe current Chairman, and of my country, Zimbabwe, I\r\nextend our warmest congratulations to you, Mr. Udovenko,\r\non your unanimous election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session. Your election\r\nto that high office is a fitting and eloquent tribute to your\r\npersonal diplomatic qualities and to the valuable role that\r\nyour country, Ukraine, is playing in international affairs.\r\nWe are confident that, under your wise stewardship, the\r\ndeliberations of this session will achieve significant results.\r\nWe commend Ambassador Razali, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session, for having\r\nbrought his experience and wisdom to bear upon the\r\nvarious special sessions and working groups of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that he presided over during the past\r\nyear, particularly in the area of United Nations reform.\r\nMay I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his vision and for his exemplary\r\nleadership of the United Nations. I wish to commend him\r\nparticularly for his tireless efforts to assist Member States\r\nin transforming the United Nations into a more dynamic,\r\nrelevant and effective instrument for meeting the\r\nchallenges that confront us as we approach the end of this\r\nmillennium.\r\nAfrica has consistently underlined the need for\r\nreform of the United Nations and other multilateral\r\nbodies, to promote the democratization and effectiveness\r\nof the international decision-making process. Indeed, we\r\nhave maintained that such international bodies should\r\ntruly serve the collective interests of the peoples of the\r\nworld. It is in this context that we welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s bold package of proposals, contained in the\r\nreport entitled “Renewing the United Nations: a\r\nProgramme for Reform” (A/51/950), which has been\r\npresented to the Assembly. These proposals merit our\r\nserious consideration. We have taken note of those\r\nproposals that the Secretary-General has implemented or\r\nintends to implement, as they fall within the purview of\r\nhis powers as chief administrator of the Organization. We\r\nhave also taken note of the proposals that he is placing\r\nbefore Member States for their consideration.\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nWe stand ready to work closely with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and other delegations to ensure that the reform\r\nprocess is speeded up on the basis of consensus and\r\ndemocratic participation. What is crucial to us is that\r\nreforms go to the heart of the matter — namely, the\r\nremoval of anachronistic and undemocratic arrangements\r\nintroduced over 50 years ago.\r\nThe reform and expansion of the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council is not only desirable but also imperative\r\nif the Council is to ensure the successful implementation of\r\nits global mandate to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity on behalf of all States. The fact that major\r\ngeographical and political groupings representing the\r\noverwhelming majority of the peoples of the world remain\r\nunder-represented and without permanent seats on the\r\nSecurity Council is the greatest anomaly of our times.\r\nEqually anomalous is a situation in which in this\r\nenlightened age the wishes of the overwhelming majority in\r\nthe General Assembly will continue to be subjected to the\r\nwhims and dictates of the privileged few by virtue of their\r\nwielding the power of the veto.\r\nWhy should a small minority of States continue to\r\nwield so much power over the destiny of the majority\r\nwithout the latter’s consent? Why, indeed, are there\r\nfrequent and persistent attempts by few States to undermine\r\nand circumvent the most democratic and representative\r\nbody of the United Nations — the General Assembly — on\r\nmatters of crucial concern to the entire international\r\ncommunity? What are we to make of this? Are we meant\r\nto conclude that democracy and good governance at the\r\ninternational level should only be at the pleasure and behest\r\nof the mighty and powerful? Surely this state of affairs\r\ncannot continue, as it makes a mockery of the lofty and\r\nhallowed democratic principles we profess to cherish dearly\r\nat the national level.\r\nThe thirty-third ordinary summit of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU), held in Harare in June this year,\r\nunderscored the pressing need for democratizing the United\r\nNations Security Council and stressed that the process\r\nshould take full account of the position of Africa as the\r\nlargest continental grouping at the United Nations as far as\r\nthe allocation of permanent and non-permanent seats in the\r\nreformed Council is concerned. The summit concurred with\r\nthe position of the Non-Aligned Movement that use of the\r\npower of the veto should be restricted if it is not abolished.\r\nHowever, for as long as it exists, the new permanent\r\nmembers of the Council should be granted the same\r\nprerogatives and powers as the current members.\r\nAnother area of fundamental importance to Africa\r\npertains to the reforms in the economic and social fields\r\nof the United Nations. Africa is of the view that for\r\nreforms in this sphere to be meaningful and credible they\r\nshould seek to reinforce the pivotal role of the United\r\nNations in development and, conversely, the centrality of\r\ndevelopment to the United Nations agenda. We firmly\r\nbelieve in the role of free enterprise as the motive force\r\nin economic development. But any attempts to re-fashion\r\nan exclusively political mandate for the United Nations\r\nwill marginalize its role in development, while giving free\r\nplay to blind market forces and finance capital. This is\r\nclearly contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nshould be resisted.\r\nThe United Nations needs adequate financial\r\nresources if it is to continue to fulfil its mandate\r\neffectively, particularly in the light of the ever-expanding\r\nburden of responsibilities that it has to shoulder. It is\r\ntherefore imperative for Member States to ensure that\r\nthey pay their dues and pay them in a timely fashion.\r\nUnilateral actions to adjust the Organization’s scale of\r\nassessment or to withhold funds from certain United\r\nNations programmes undermine the very foundation of\r\nthe Organization and therefore should not be condoned.\r\nIn the area of disarmament, we welcome the\r\nadoption at the recently concluded Oslo Conference of the\r\ndraft treaty on the global ban on anti-personnel mines.\r\nThe overwhelming support that the treaty received is\r\neloquent testimony to the determination of the\r\ninternational community to rid itself of these deadly\r\nweapons, which have killed or maimed millions of\r\ninnocent people the world over. Africa, which has one of\r\nthe largest concentrations of anti-personnel mines and\r\nperhaps the highest number of victims of these weapons,\r\nis happy to join this international consensus. It is our\r\nhope that those who remain outside the Ottawa process\r\nwill reconsider their position and decide to sign the treaty\r\nwhen it is opened for signature in December of this year.\r\nThe past few years have witnessed the African\r\ncontinent undergoing a dual process of economic and\r\npolitical reforms. These reforms have in many countries\r\nresulted in greater democratization, as well as in higher\r\neconomic growth rates. In the political sphere, democracy\r\nand good governance have taken root on our continent. In\r\nthe past few years, we have witnessed the end of the\r\ndictatorships and military governments in many parts of\r\nAfrica, and their replacement by governments committed\r\nto the political empowerment of their people. In the\r\neconomic sphere, economic structural adjustment\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nprogrammes not only have stimulated high growth rates of\r\nbetween 5 and 10 per cent per annum, but have also created\r\nan environment that is increasingly receptive to foreign\r\ndirect investment and greater participation of the private\r\nsector in our economies. Most countries have also entered\r\ninto multilateral and bilateral investment treaties with both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries.\r\nAt the subregional and continental levels, Africa has\r\ntaken unprecedented steps to assume greater control of its\r\nfuture through economic integration. The historic convening\r\nin Harare in June this year of the inaugural session of the\r\nAssembly of Heads of Government of the African\r\nEconomic Community was an important landmark in\r\nAfrica’s efforts to build a stable and prosperous future for\r\nits people. The session resolved to strengthen the African\r\nEconomic Community through the conclusion of protocols\r\nwith subregional organizations, such as the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\r\n(COMESA), among others, which are essential building\r\nblocks for a viable economic community at a continental\r\nlevel.\r\nFor these efforts to succeed, however, it is vital that\r\nAfrica receive the prerequisite support and cooperation of\r\nits development partners and, indeed, that of the\r\ninternational community at large. We should never\r\nunderestimate the enormous obstacles that the African\r\neconomies are confronted with. Africa’s external debt\r\nproblem and the heavy burden of debt repayments continue\r\nto drain many of our economies of the much-needed capital\r\nfor development. More resources in the form of debt\r\nrepayments than those coming in the form of aid are\r\nleaving the continent. There is a need, therefore, for\r\ninternational financial institutions to adopt a unified and\r\ncoordinated approach to Africa’s debt problem that will\r\nhelp to redress the situation. There can be no better time\r\nthan now for the international community to augment our\r\nown efforts to bring the much-awaited peace dividend to\r\nour people.\r\nForeign direct investment to Africa should continue to\r\nbe augmented by official development assistance. The\r\nsteady fall of this assistance from 0.34 per cent in 1992 to\r\n0.25 per cent in 1996 is therefore a matter of serious\r\nconcern to us. We commend those countries which have\r\nsurpassed the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross\r\ndomestic product to official development assistance and\r\nurge others to do likewise. We welcome new initiatives on\r\nAfrica that have recently been announced in the area of\r\ntrade, investment and infrastructure development. These\r\nare, indeed, a result of the recognition that Africa risks\r\nbeing marginalized unless innovative ways are found to\r\nsupport its development efforts.\r\nAfrica in terms of conflict situations still suffers\r\nfrom a number of setbacks. The situation in Sierra Leone,\r\nwhere a military junta overthrew the democratically\r\nelected Government of that country in May this year, is\r\na matter of serious concern to us. The Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), meeting in Harare for its thirty-\r\nthird summit, unequivocally condemned the coup and\r\ncalled for the immediate and unconditional restoration of\r\nthe constitutional Government of Sierra Leone. Africa’s\r\nmessage is loud and clear. The days of military\r\ndictatorships are over. Africa cannot and will not give\r\nlegitimacy to regimes that willy-nilly flout the rule of law\r\nand the popular aspirations of their people. We appeal to\r\nthe international community not to give solace to these\r\nmilitary juntas in the name of humanitarian aid, but to\r\nstand solidly with Africa in denying them recognition.\r\nOf equal concern to Africa are the crises in the\r\nRepublic of Congo (Brazzaville), Somalia, the Sudan,\r\nWestern Sahara, Burundi and the Comoros. In this respect\r\nwe take note of, and reaffirm our support for, the United\r\nNations initiative through the Secretary-General’s envoy,\r\nMr. James Baker, which seeks to find a lasting solution\r\nto the problem of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.\r\nThe OAU is working tirelessly through the\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution in search of African solutions to these African\r\nproblems. We call on the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community at large to support Africa’s\r\ninitiatives to resolve these conflicts and to strengthen the\r\nOAU’s capacity for preventive diplomacy and conflict\r\nresolution.\r\nWe are encouraged by the continued engagement of\r\nthe United Nations in Angola and welcome the adoption\r\nby the Security Council last month of resolution 1127\r\n(1997), calling on the União Nacional para a\r\nIndependência Total de Angola (UNITA) to abide by the\r\nLusaka Protocol. Africa and the entire international\r\ncommunity welcomed the successful holding of elections\r\nin Liberia, and we congratulate the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) on the important role\r\nit played in helping to bring that conflict to an end.\r\nWe salute the people of the Democratic Republic of\r\nCongo on the positive developments that have taken place\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nin their country and welcome the commitment of their\r\nGovernment to restore and uphold democracy and\r\ndemocratic principles. Obviously, after so many decades of\r\ndictatorship and plunder, the task of rehabilitation and\r\nreconstruction in that country is not going to be an easy\r\none. The people of the Democratic Republic of Congo need\r\nour support in their endeavours to restore peace and\r\nstability in their country.\r\nIndeed, basic necessities such as food and shelter,\r\ntogether with peace, security and stability, are the foremost\r\nhuman rights that the people of the Democratic Republic of\r\nCongo ask of the international community in this, their hour\r\nof greatest need. While inquiry into alleged massacres in\r\nthe Congo may be important, the lofty principles of peace,\r\ndemocracy and good governance which we all cherish so\r\ndearly, will be realized in that country only if immediate\r\nsupport is provided by the international community.\r\nIn respect of the dispute between the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya and both the United States and Britain\r\nconcerning the Lockerbie issue, the OAU summit expressed\r\nthe hope that the Security Council would consider ways and\r\nmeans to ensure a rapid resolution of this dispute.\r\nThe peace process in the Middle East is in serious\r\njeopardy as a result of Israel’s refusal to freeze the building\r\nof settlements in the occupied territories. There is a real\r\nrisk of reversal of important gains that have been achieved\r\nso far in that part of the world. We call on the parties to\r\nthe peace process to show good faith and give peace a\r\nchance.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that we believe the\r\nUnited Nations reform process has reached a crucial stage.\r\nWe have always believed that the United Nations, as a\r\nliving organism, needs to respond to its changing\r\nenvironment. It is our sincere hope, therefore, that we can\r\nmake progress expeditiously. We in Africa aspire, in these\r\nreforms, for a United Nations which upholds universal\r\nvalues and interests, attends to the urgent needs of the least-\r\ndeveloped regions of the world, and remains at the service\r\nof humanity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Kiro Gligorov, President of the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia.\r\nMr. Kiro Gligorov, President of the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kiro Gligorov, President of the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Gligorov (spoke in Macedonian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): First of all, Sir, allow\r\nme to congratulate you on your election as President of\r\nthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly of the\r\nUnited Nations and to wish you success in the execution\r\nof that responsible and lofty function. I am especially\r\npleased that the General Assembly has elected to this very\r\nresponsible function a very competent representative from\r\nUkraine, a friendly country with which the Republic of\r\nMacedonia is developing successful cooperation.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia attaches great\r\nimportance to the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly. On the threshold of the twenty-first century,\r\nthe interdependence of peace and global development is\r\na standard that must be respected. It is dangerous for\r\nsome to develop while others continuously regress. This\r\ntrend can only be a source of conflicts, of confrontation\r\nof interests, even of wars. Consequently, there is no\r\nalternative to the strengthening of peace through the\r\npromotion of international cooperation, and our\r\nOrganization faces the serious responsibility of being even\r\nmore efficient and more focused on essential issues. This\r\nis the direction that the Macedonian delegation will also\r\npursue.\r\nI applaud the fact that the Organization is headed by\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, a very competent reformer who believes\r\nin the irreplaceable role of the United Nations as a\r\nguarantor of international peace and security. His\r\nprogramme for United Nations reform, as contained in his\r\nreport of July of this year, is one of the most topical\r\nissues before the Organization. We believe that the\r\nessential changes that have been proposed take into\r\naccount the basic consideration that the United Nations\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nremain a democratic institution representing the interests of\r\nall Members. We too, much like the Secretary-General,\r\nwish the Organization to be a promoter of new changes, a\r\ntrue centre where countries can harmonize their activities in\r\nbuilding a better world. Whether the United Nations will\r\ntruly become such an organization will depend on all of us,\r\nand the Republic of Macedonia will continue to make its\r\ncontribution to that end. In that context, the emerging\r\npriorities are as follows: a stronger General Assembly,\r\nreform of United Nations organs, and above all of the\r\nSecurity Council, a reduction in the number of ad hoc\r\nbodies, greater transparency of operations, and maximum\r\ncontrol over the budget of the Organization, financial\r\nspending and contributions.\r\nAllow me to address some of the priority tasks that\r\nthe United Nations will have to face in the coming period,\r\ntasks which should not be placed in the background because\r\nof the reform of the United Nations. Indeed, that reform\r\nmust be in the service of a more efficient resolution of the\r\nbitter issues that burden the international community. The\r\ncredibility of the United Nations will to a large measure\r\ndepend on this, for in the coming period much energy will\r\nhave to be devoted to ending existing crises and conflicts\r\nand to preventing the eruption of new ones.\r\nThe United Nations has become renowned for its\r\nsuccessful peacekeeping operations. I should like to use this\r\nopportunity to express my highest appraisal of the presence\r\nof the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force\r\n(UNPREDEP) in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as my\r\nappreciation to all the participants in that operation, which\r\nhas helped prevent a spillover of the conflict from some\r\nparts of the former Yugoslavia to my country.\r\nWith regard to the crisis in Albania, my country has\r\nconstantly felt the need for the effective presence of the\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping forces. The cooperation\r\nbetween the Macedonian Government and UNPREDEP, one\r\nof the most successful preventive operations in the history\r\nof the United Nations, is truly excellent. My pleasure is\r\nincreased by the reports of the Secretary-General that\r\ncontain the same assessments. The mission of UNPREDEP\r\nis ongoing. We believe that it should continue, for the\r\npresence of peacekeepers in the Republic of Macedonia\r\nserves not only as a dam preventing the existing crisis\r\npoints in the Balkans from overflowing, but also as an actor\r\nworking for peace, security and stability in the country’s\r\nsouthern regions.\r\nIn that context, the Republic of Macedonia has\r\nwelcomed and follows closely the implementation of the\r\nDayton Accord. It is a matter of principle that the\r\nindicted war criminals be brought to justice. The\r\ninternational community, epitomized in the United\r\nNations, must not allow the Dayton Accord to fail. Hence,\r\nit is imperative to give impetus to further engagement by\r\nthe Organization, in coordination with the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union, in\r\nsustaining the peace process. A particularly important part\r\nof that effort, I would emphasize, is the normalization of\r\nrelations between the Balkan countries, on the basis of\r\ngood-neighbourliness and mutual respect. Within its\r\ncapacities, the Republic of Macedonia has made and will\r\ncontinue to make the maximum contribution to that effect.\r\nThe agenda of this session of the Assembly also\r\nincludes the development of good-neighbourly relations\r\nbetween Balkan countries, in accordance with resolution\r\n50/80, adopted following our proposal at the fiftieth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, and the election of new\r\nmembers of the Security Council for the term from 1998\r\nto 1999. Allow me to address these issues briefly.\r\nThroughout the twentieth century, the Balkans has\r\nremained a concern for the international community due\r\nto the many wars waged in this region. The Republic of\r\nMacedonia has unequivocally opted for peace there. In\r\nthis context, we are engaged in an active policy of good-\r\nneighbourliness and mutual cooperation with all Balkan\r\ncountries. This can also be seen through resolutions 48/84\r\nand 50/80 B proposed by the Republic of Macedonia and\r\nsponsored by many Balkan countries — but not just\r\nBalkan countries — and adopted with the vast support\r\nand consensus of the General Assembly. The Republic of\r\nMacedonia is committed to respecting the territorial\r\nintegrity and sovereignty of the Balkan States and the\r\ninviolability of international frontiers, and to advancing\r\nmutual cooperation in all spheres. We are particularly\r\ncommitted to the institutionalized and functional\r\nintegration of the Balkans in the European integration\r\nprocesses. During this session, our delegation will submit\r\na draft resolution for the development of good-\r\nneighbourly relations in the Balkans. I hope that the\r\nGeneral Assembly will adopt it by consensus.\r\nAs long ago as 1994, my country, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, submitted its candidacy as a non-permanent\r\nmember of the Security Council from the Eastern\r\nEuropean group of countries, for the term from 1998 to\r\n1999. I also announced our candidacy during my address\r\nto the Assembly last year. I am pleased that many United\r\nNations Members have expressed great understanding of\r\nour motives and arguments, and have supported the need\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nfor one Balkan country to be elected as a member of the\r\nSecurity Council. We very much appreciate the support for\r\nand confidence in our candidacy that we expect to receive\r\nfrom the Assembly. We would like to make our own\r\ncontribution to the activities of the Security Council and the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole by incorporating our own policy\r\nof peace and democracy into those activities on the issues\r\nwhich fall within those organs\u0027 areas of responsibility. I\r\nwould like to assure the Assembly that our delegation on\r\nthe Security Council will act in full accordance with the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. In the period that lies ahead,\r\nUnited Nations bodies will continue to deal with Balkan\r\nproblems and the general Balkan situation. This is reality.\r\nFor these reasons, it is quite logical that the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, as a Balkan country, be elected to this function.\r\nIt will be a great honour for us to shoulder this\r\nresponsibility, and, at the same time, a great obligation for\r\nwhich we have long been preparing.\r\nThe processes of democratic transformation in many\r\ncountries in the world will undoubtedly continue at the\r\nsame pace in the twenty-first century. This trend will\r\ninevitably influence the character of overall and\r\ncomprehensive international relations in global proportions.\r\nThe United Nations and other organs within its system must\r\ninevitably take part in these changes. Only if the rules of\r\ninternational law are abided by and the real situation on the\r\nground is respected can a better and more humane world be\r\ncreated and thus our trust in our Organization increased. I\r\nam confident that the reforms that have been announced, or\r\nrather their consistent implementation, will lead to an even\r\ngreater affirmation of the United Nations and its\r\ncommitment to combating policies of force and domination\r\nand to supporting peace, cooperation and the balanced\r\ndevelopment of all countries and peoples. In a word, we are\r\nconfident that in this way the United Nations will be even\r\nmore efficient in responding to the objectives and ideals of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Kiro Gligorov, President of the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I should like to remind\r\nrepresentatives that, in accordance with the decision taken\r\nby the General Assembly at its 4th plenary meeting, the\r\nlist of speakers will be closed today at 6 p.m.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Inder Kumar\r\nGujral, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of India\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of India.\r\nMr. Inder Kumar Gujral, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of India, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of India, His Excellency Mr. Inder Kumar\r\nGujral, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Gujral (India): Mr. President, it is a particular\r\npleasure for me to see you presiding over the General\r\nAssembly. As Ambassador to the former Soviet Union for\r\nfive years, I had a long association with Ukraine, and I\r\nretain the fondest memories of my several visits to your\r\nbeautiful country. You preside over an Assembly that will\r\ndeliberate on crucial issues before the world community,\r\non which your experience and guidance will be\r\ninvaluable. I would also like to congratulate your\r\npredecessor, Ambassador Razali Ismail, on the\r\nengagement with which he acted during his presidency to\r\ncarry our work forward. I am delighted also to see the\r\nSecretary-General here.\r\nWe are celebrating in India the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof our emergence as a free nation. The constitutional\r\nmoorings and the democratic forms which the new nation-\r\nState has accepted and adopted rest on the vast foundation\r\nof civilizational experience and ethos. This explains the\r\nstability, coherence and creative unity of the vast Indian\r\nsociety, which is a world in itself. The experience has\r\nwrought in us the deep conviction that, while there are\r\nuniversally shared values and striving, there can be no\r\nrigid prescriptions. We see the United Nations in this\r\nimage, as a crucible in which we meld together our\r\nindividual contributions to a world civilization, yet\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nrecognizing the variety of historical and cultural experiences\r\nwe bring to it.\r\nThe cold war cast an early shadow on the\r\nOrganization, creating a situation of ideological\r\npolarization. The Non-Aligned Movement rejected this\r\nimposition of rigidity, representing an independent and\r\nresponsible alternative to the world view. This remains true,\r\nand the Non-Aligned Movement retains its validity and\r\nrelevance, even after the disappearance of bloc rivalries.\r\nNon-alignment was not a by-product of the cold war. Then,\r\nit expressed the overwhelming need of previously colonized\r\nand disempowered nations to a voice, a perspective and an\r\nagenda in a politically and economically unequal and\r\ninequitable world. Today, it remains a voice of reason and\r\nconstructive engagement for the times ahead, which demand\r\ncommon purpose and contribution from all sides towards a\r\nconvergence of intent on vital, even fateful, global\r\nconcerns.\r\nSince the creation of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, the world should have changed far more than it\r\nhas in the half century that has elapsed. Decolonization is\r\nalmost complete, but the scars of colonization are still with\r\nus. The present bears a heavy burden of the past. South\r\nAfrica is free, but racism rears its ugly head amidst us,\r\noften laced with xenophobia. Development and growth —\r\nand even human dignity — remain for much of the world\r\na distant dream. We must insistently ask ourselves what we\r\ncan decisively do at the United Nations to make the dreams\r\nof the hundreds of millions come true, how we can make\r\nthe United Nations a more vibrant organization for the\r\nworld community as a whole, at a time when we need it\r\nmore than we ever have, a United Nations that is better\r\nequipped to fully respond to the challenges of the next\r\ncentury.\r\nAs an organization, the United Nations must also\r\nevolve and adapt itself to a rapidly changing environment,\r\nthe better to serve the core needs of the world community.\r\nAs a country which sets very great store on the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations to contribute to international peace and\r\nsecurity, and to development — the two crucial priorities\r\nbefore the world community — India, like others, has a\r\nvital interest in a United Nations that continually makes\r\nitself more responsive to the needs of its Member States\r\nand prepares itself to serve them better. This, we believe,\r\nis the objective of reform. We are hence very pleased that\r\nthe Secretary-General, immediately after taking office,\r\nmade reform one of his priorities and we congratulate him\r\non this commitment. Within the first seven months of his\r\ntenure, he has produced a series of proposals of impressive\r\nbreadth and scope. These are before us, and many have\r\ndescribed this session as a reform General Assembly. In\r\nthis connection, I extend my good wishes to you,\r\nMr. Secretary-General.\r\nWe judge the agenda for reform by the measures I\r\nhave described. We are supportive of all proposals that,\r\nin our view, will carry forward, or improve, the\r\nSecretariat’s ability to respond to the mandates of the\r\ninternational community. We will express our thoughts\r\nconstructively with the aim of strengthening the process\r\nand direction of reform to the collective advantage of the\r\nglobal community and the Organization that represents it.\r\nWe do not see reform simply as an exercise to trim the\r\nbudget of the United Nations. Instead, reforms should\r\ncontribute towards strengthening the United Nations and\r\nits capacity to respond effectively to the priorities\r\nidentified by the overwhelming majority of its\r\nmembership.\r\nThe crisis that confronts the United Nations\r\nmanifests itself in many ways. A financial crisis has\r\nresulted from the inability of some to fulfil their Charter\r\ncommitments, and from the laying down of pre-conditions\r\nto meet them. The United Nations does not have the\r\nmeans to execute programmes that respond to the felt\r\nneeds and priorities of its membership, precisely at a time\r\nwhen such programmes are sorely necessary. As a result,\r\nthe United Nations is in danger of being marginalized as\r\nthe global forum where decisions can be taken that truly\r\nrespond to the challenges of globalization. The solution\r\nlies not in piecemeal reform but in building trust between\r\nnations, and in an acceptance that in international\r\nrelations democratic principles should be the norm, just as\r\nthey are being increasingly accepted in national\r\ngovernance.\r\nIn our view, international peace and security and\r\ndevelopment are inextricably linked. The one is\r\nimpossible to achieve without the other. Over the last six\r\nor seven years, there has been a growing emphasis on the\r\npolitical aspects of the tasks of development, such as\r\ndemocracy and human rights. Unless the underlying\r\ncauses of underdevelopment, poverty and social alienation\r\nare effectively addressed and removed, this emphasis will\r\nremain unrealized. Therefore, the single most important\r\ntarget that the United Nations should set itself is the\r\npromotion of sustained economic growth in the\r\ndeveloping countries that will lead to the eradication of\r\npoverty, and erase the tensions and pressures that have\r\nled to the collapse of governance and social order in\r\nseveral States, and to conflicts between others.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nInternational peace and stability will be enhanced only\r\nwhen all countries enjoy a minimum standard of economic\r\nself-sufficiency and well-being. Therefore, we believe that\r\nthe thrust of any reform proposals in the United Nations\r\nshould make the promotion of sustained economic\r\ndevelopment the principal cross-sectoral issue for the\r\nSecretariat’s programmes. We believe that there are enough\r\nintergovernmental mandates to permit the Secretariat to\r\ntailor programmes towards this end.\r\nThe universality of human rights, to which we all\r\ncommitted ourselves almost five years ago at Vienna,\r\nexpresses itself at one level in the international norms for\r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights and our\r\ncollective efforts to foster respect for these standards. On a\r\nhigher plane, this universality stems from the search in\r\ndifferent civilizations for ways of protecting the human\r\ndignity of every individual. Next year, as we celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, we will reflect on whether the ideals enshrined in\r\nthe Declaration have become a reality for people in all parts\r\nof the world. As we do so, we must build confidence in a\r\nprocess that encourages introspection and self-criticism,\r\ndialogue and consultation, rather than confrontation and\r\njudgement. The Declaration calls for the advent of a world\r\norder in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech\r\nand belief and freedom from fear and want as the highest\r\naspirations of the common people. It recognizes the\r\nimportance of economic, social and cultural rights as well\r\nas their interdependence with civil and political rights. The\r\nfull realization of all these rights is what will give true\r\nmeaning to the quest for human dignity embodied in the\r\nUniversal Declaration.\r\nIndia’s approach to the observance and promotion of\r\nhuman rights is inspired by the holistic vision of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the Indian\r\nConstitution. A strong constitutional framework, mutually\r\nreinforcing safeguards, both within and outside this\r\nframework; a policy of transparency and responsiveness to\r\ncivil society; and cooperation with the human rights system\r\nof the United Nations — in particular with the treaty\r\nbodies — are the main elements of this approach in the\r\nareas of civil and political rights. Equally important, if not\r\nmore so, are the assault on poverty and underdevelopment;\r\nthe promotion of awareness of rights; and a policy of\r\naffirmative action for the uplifting of socially and\r\neconomically vulnerable sectors of society.\r\nThis is a complex task, especially in a country of\r\nIndia’s diversity. Many times, when the State has faltered\r\ncivil society has stepped in. In India, as elsewhere,\r\nindividuals have wrought miracles by working outside the\r\nestablished systems and going beyond traditional ways of\r\nthinking. In recent times, the most moving example has\r\nbeen that of a frail, sari-clad woman: Mother Teresa. Her\r\nfathomless compassion and soothing touch will be missed\r\nby millions in India. I would like to pay tribute to this\r\napostle of mercy who rendered service and brought hope\r\nto millions of poor and suffering people, not only in India\r\nbut all over the world.\r\nWhile development must be our supreme objective,\r\nwe also need peace, stability and security in order to\r\nachieve it. The dangers that threaten us have become\r\nincreasingly more frightening during the last 50 years\r\nthan any that have cast their shadow over mankind in its\r\nentire history. The development of nuclear, chemical and\r\nbiological weapons has made it possible to destroy whole\r\npopulations. As the international community, we have\r\ndecided to outlaw the production, possession and use of\r\nchemical and biological weapons.\r\nHowever, with regard to the weapons of mass\r\ndestruction capable of the total annihilation of human\r\ncivilization, the global community has lived for too long\r\non a diet of empty promises. The pretexts cited in favour\r\nof clinging to nuclear arsenals, while always questionable,\r\nhave now vanished. Mere non-proliferation treaties\r\npromoted as disarmament measures only serve to entrench\r\na nuclear monopoly. No credible steps towards striving to\r\nrealize a nuclear-weapon-free world are contemplated,\r\nmuch less taken, by those who should be showing the\r\nway. No justifications can be proffered, as they were\r\nduring the cold war.\r\nThe patience of the world community — as\r\nexpressed by the International Court of Justice, by the\r\nenlightened voices of those who formerly believed in\r\ndeterrence, by political and general opinion and by\r\nweighty voluntary initiatives — is starting to wear thin.\r\nNuclear-weapon Powers owe it to the world to answer the\r\nquestion why they need nuclear weapons. Global opinion\r\nwants a nuclear weapons convention — as has already\r\nbeen outlined for the class of biological and chemical\r\nweapons — and will not rest until it is achieved. We\r\nappeal to nuclear-weapon States to align their policies\r\nwith what the world wants. We see the United Nations as\r\nthe forum in which the international community must\r\ncontinue to demand universal nuclear disarmament, and\r\nwe therefore expect that the Secretariat\u0027s programmes will\r\nsupport this intergovernmental objective.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nUnder the Charter, the Security Council was\r\nconstituted as a body on which the general membership\r\nconferred primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, acting on its behalf. In\r\nrecent years, the Security Council has been able to play a\r\nmore active role in discharging its responsibilities.\r\nHowever, there is often a perception that the Council’s\r\nactions have not always reflected the sentiments of the\r\ngeneral membership. Therefore, it is imperative — and the\r\ntime has come — for the Security Council to take on as\r\npermanent members developing countries which are\r\nequipped to make important contributions through their\r\nworld views and historical experiences and the values of\r\ntheir civilizations. In this way the decisions of the Council\r\nwill truly reflect the wider membership of the United\r\nNations. Otherwise, the Council’s actions will be seen as\r\nprogressively less representative precisely at a time when it\r\nis being called upon to act far more frequently than before\r\non behalf of the world community.\r\nIndia has let it be known in the General Assembly\r\nsince 1994 that it is prepared to accept the responsibilities\r\nof permanent membership. We are the largest democracy in\r\nthe world, with a civilization replete with ancient values\r\nand achievements, as well as a world view based on a\r\nuniversalist inspiration, participatory governance, respect for\r\ndiversity and pluralism, and a readiness for constructive\r\nengagement in the world’s affairs. These strengths, we\r\nbelieve, would be an asset to an expanded Security Council.\r\nIndia’s standing as one of the leading economies of the\r\nworld will be progressively strengthened, and we are\r\nprepared to bear fully the responsibilities of permanent\r\nmembership. India’s long-standing participation in United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations testifies not only to the\r\ndedication and professionalism of Indian soldiers, but also\r\nto the political will of the Government to actively\r\ncontribute to these operations.\r\nThe core of our foreign policy is our keenness to\r\npursue close ties and build confidence and cooperation with\r\nour neighbours, while recognizing fully that we are the\r\nlargest country in the region, in terms not only of size and\r\npopulation but also of economic capabilities. We extend our\r\nhand of friendship not in a spirit of mere reciprocity but in\r\ngood faith. Where we do expect reciprocity, unrelated to\r\nsize and capacity, is in mutual respect for each other’s\r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty. We seek to advance\r\ncohesion, synergy and mutual goodwill in our\r\nneighbourhood so that together we can fully participate in\r\nand derive benefits from the dynamic changes the world is\r\ncurrently witnessing. Our approach has contributed to the\r\nsetting in motion of a trend towards cooperation in our\r\nregion.\r\nAs a large and diverse economy, we are developing\r\nnew partnerships that go beyond the region and revitalize\r\nthe old cultural and commercial links. Politically, this is\r\nexpressed in the active interest that we have taken in\r\nsupporting the Middle East peace process — our ties with\r\nthe Arab world reaching deep into history — and our\r\nstrong fraternal ties with developing countries in general\r\nand with Africa in particular. In our larger\r\nneighbourhood, with which we have a shared history, we\r\nhave enhanced our engagement with the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a full-dialogue\r\npartner and as a participant in the ASEAN Regional\r\nForum.\r\nWhile maintaining our traditional relationships with\r\nthe United States, Russia, the European Union and Japan,\r\nwe have also been strengthening global trends in regional\r\ncooperation by actively promoting cooperation among\r\ncountries of the Indian Ocean rim and trying to recover\r\nthe cultural and commercial connectivities that have\r\nexisted since time immemorial and which were snapped\r\nin the colonial era.\r\nGlobal society is seeking to find an equilibrium\r\nbetween the opposing pulls generated by the forces of\r\nglobalization, nationalism and sub-nationalism. Indeed, it\r\nis difficult to see just how they can be balanced, yet they\r\nmust be or else the potential for international\r\nconflagration will be immense. Hence, the absolute need\r\nfor extreme caution to prevent established nation States\r\nfrom being destabilized either through too hasty a push\r\ntowards globalization or through the pull of sub-national\r\ndemands. We see this as a challenge which we will have\r\nto face collectively as well as individually.\r\nA global menace that threatens international peace,\r\nand to which open democracies are particularly\r\nvulnerable, is terrorism. It takes innocent lives\r\nindiscriminately, brings fear into the lives of others and\r\nshatters the peaceful existence and the normal growth of\r\nentire communities. Terrorism should be anathema to the\r\ninternational community because it is the antithesis of\r\nevery ideal that the United Nations Charter enshrines. Its\r\nmain vehicle is violence; its aim is destruction rather than\r\ndevelopment; its doctrines are founded on intolerance;\r\nand, in the means it uses and the effect it has, it destroys\r\nhuman rights utterly.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nIncitement to terrorism and complicity and\r\nparticipation in terrorism across borders undermine the\r\ninternational system. And even though very few societies\r\nare free from its clutches, we still have not developed a\r\nglobal strategy to defeat this evil. The resolve is absent. It\r\nis important that we find it, not least because terrorism has\r\na global web, spanning all countries and continents and\r\nquickly building links with the other global menace: drugs.\r\nWe in India see in our region just how deadly a poison this\r\nmix of terrorism and drugs is. The United Nations should\r\ntake the lead in determined global action to root out these\r\nscourges.\r\nThe protection and preservation of the environment is\r\nan area to which all of us attach the highest importance.\r\nThe commitment to global partnership for preventing\r\nfurther degradation of the environment, made at the Rio\r\nSummit in 1992, was reiterated and the need for effective\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 reaffirmed during the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly in June this year. All the\r\nelements of Agenda 21 have to be implemented in full and\r\nwe need to accelerate the process of such implementation.\r\nAny partial or non-comprehensive implementation will be\r\ndetrimental not only to international cooperation in this\r\narea, but also to the threatened stability of the Earth’s\r\nfragile environment. In this connection, it is our hope that\r\nthe spirit of the Convention on Climate Change and the\r\nBerlin Mandate will be fully encompassed by the protocol\r\nor legal instrument to emerge from the Kyoto Conference\r\nto be held in December 1997.\r\nWhat has been touched upon represents huge\r\nchallenges beyond the capacity of any country to face on its\r\nown. This is why it is so vital for the United Nations, now\r\nmore than ever before, to be a forum where we can pool\r\ncreative ideas and lessons from our experience and to assist\r\nus in understanding and coping with these challenges. This\r\nis the ultimate rationale of reform. We will be ready to\r\nwork with other countries to rebuild the United Nations in\r\nthe image of our collective aspirations and as our trusted\r\ninstrument to meet the challenges of the approaching\r\ncentury.\r\nAddressing the General Assembly at its fifteenth\r\nregular session, I recall India’s first Prime Minister,\r\nJawaharlal Nehru, saying here in 1960:\r\n“The main purpose of the United Nations is to\r\nbuild up a world without war, a world based on the\r\ncooperation of nations and peoples. It is not merely a\r\nworld where war is kept in check for a balancing of\r\narmed forces. It is much deeper than that. It is a world\r\nfrom which the major causes of war have been\r\nremoved and social structures built up which further\r\npeaceful cooperation within a nation as well as\r\nbetween nations.” (Official Records of the General\r\nAssembly, Fifteenth session, Plenary Meetings,\r\n882nd meeting, para. 117)\r\nIt is in this spirit that we should approach the tasks\r\nbefore us. I do hope and pray that, under your guidance,\r\nSir, and under the spirited leadership of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, these objectives will be achieved.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of India for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Inder Kumar Gujral, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of India, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Vice-\r\nChancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Klaus Kinkel.\r\nMr. Kinkel (Germany) (spoke in German;\r\ninterpretation furnished by the delegation): I congratulate\r\nyou, Mr. President, on assuming your responsible office.\r\nMajor decisions are to be taken at this session and I wish\r\nyou good fortune in your conduct of the proceedings.\r\nI wish to thank Ambassador Razali for his\r\nexceptional commitment. He has made us all aware of the\r\ngreat responsibility we carry during this phase of reform.\r\nThe Secretary-General, through the impressive manner in\r\nwhich he presented his reform proposals, has\r\nre-emphasized that responsibility.\r\nNowhere else are we so acutely aware as at the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly that, regardless of our\r\norigins or the colour of our skin, we have a common\r\ndestiny and that we all, North and South, the small\r\ncountries and the big countries, need one another.\r\nMillions of people all over the world, especially our\r\nyouth, ask themselves whether we politicians and\r\ndelegates from 185 nations have drawn the right\r\nconclusions from this; whether we can summon the\r\npolitical will for joint action to improve their security, to\r\ngive them better opportunities in life, and to safeguard\r\ntheir rights, or whether we will go on wasting and\r\ndestroying the natural sources of human life at their\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nexpense. Those of us with adult children know how\r\nsceptical their generation have become about the\r\ncapabilities of the governing class. That is good reason for\r\nall of us to stop, think and take action, and to do so here\r\nand now.\r\nThe world about which we are talking here today and\r\nthe world which we participate in shaping is not ours alone.\r\nWe have to preserve it for future generations as well. And\r\nthis we can achieve only through a united effort. For we are\r\nonly one world community that has to survive together.\r\nThere is only one boat for all, our vulnerable blue planet,\r\nand there is only one common future, good or bad. That is\r\nthe reality we face as we cross over into the third\r\nmillennium and it is the reason why policies deriving from\r\na sense of responsibility are not utopian. Indeed, in our age\r\nthey are the only realistic approach.\r\nThe world organization’s programmes and funds, that\r\nis to say, those of the United Nation’s Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme,\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund and the World Food\r\nProgramme, together dispense more than $4.6 billion a year\r\nin the form of economic and social aid. That comes to\r\nabout 80 cents for every person on earth. By contrast, in\r\n1994 the world’s Governments spent about $767 billion on\r\narms, which was roughly $134 per person. This gross\r\ndisproportion is intolerable.\r\nI believe that we must all look beyond the rim of our\r\nown national interests. There is no more time to lose. We\r\ncannot simply come here, make and listen to speeches and\r\nthen return to business as usual for another 12 months. We\r\nhave a duty and responsibility to leave our children and\r\ngrandchildren a world which is worthy of humankind. And\r\nthat means doing something about it now, today. We must\r\nprotect the earth’s atmosphere by reducing greenhouse-gas\r\nemissions. We must ban lethal anti-personnel landmines by\r\njoining in the Ottawa process. We cannot accept that we\r\nhave hundreds of millions of anti-personnel landmines still\r\nin place in the ground of many, many countries in this\r\nworld of ours.\r\nWe must halt the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, and we must streamline the United Nations\r\nOrganization. But above all, we must pay our contributions\r\non time and in full. These are the criteria which show\r\nwhether we are living up to our responsibility.\r\nThe opportunity for effective action is there. Despite\r\ncarping criticism, international cooperation within the\r\nUnited Nations framework is working. Malnutrition and\r\nundernourishment have been reduced by a third since\r\n1960 and illiteracy by 50 per cent. Most of the credit for\r\nthis, no doubt, goes to the United Nations. Infant\r\nmortality has been halved in the same period — a great\r\nachievement by UNICEF.\r\nBetween 1990 and 1995 the world population\r\nincreased by 1.48 per cent, considerably less than the 1.72\r\nper cent growth between 1985 and 1990. This nourishes\r\nthe hope that we have got over the hump of the\r\npopulation explosion. Again, this is a big achievement\r\nlargely attributable to the work of the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund.\r\nMuch, I am pleased to note, has also been done to\r\nimprove the situation of women. This is important\r\nbecause with all the tremendous social challenges we\r\nface, the success of our efforts depends heavily on them.\r\nThey are the natural advocates of future generations. That\r\nis why one of our main objectives still is to ensure they\r\nhave equal rights, not only on paper but also in practice.\r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna,\r\nthe Earth Summit in Rio, the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development in Cairo, the Summit for\r\nSocial Development in Copenhagen and the World\r\nConference on Women in Beijing have demonstrated that\r\nthe strategies for creating a better and more equitable\r\nworld are in place. What is missing is the political will to\r\nput them into effect. We must learn to give common\r\ninterests priority over national interests.\r\nWe must start to think not only of the present but of\r\nthe future as well. The first step — and I think it cannot\r\nbe underlined enough — is to reform and strengthen the\r\nOrganization which embodies all these objectives: the\r\nUnited Nations, our United Nations.\r\nThere has been enough talk. Time is running out. At\r\nthis fifty-second session, the General Assembly must\r\nmake decisions. The backlog of reforms must be dealt\r\nwith during this session.\r\nTrue, Governments and politicians don’t possess a\r\nmagic wand with which to put the world in order. And I\r\nreadily admit, as a politician, that it is disappointing to\r\ndiscover how relatively little we ourselves can change,\r\neven in high positions, and I take it that it is the same\r\nwith the others present here. But that does not absolve us\r\nfrom the responsibility to do everything in our power to\r\nbring about necessary change and progress.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nThere is more than enough to be done. The world is\r\nstill profoundly unjust. From the moment of their birth,\r\nmillions of people have hardly any chance of leading a life\r\nin conditions worthy of the human race. According to\r\nUNICEF, more than 20 million children all over the world\r\nare on the move. About 300,000 children were killed in the\r\nRwanda massacres. As a result of the 17-year-old war in\r\nAfghanistan, another 280,000 or so have died from\r\nundernourishment and disease. The civil war in Cambodia\r\nhas made some 350,000 children orphans. Every 90 minutes\r\na child is maimed by a landmine.\r\nYet it is on our children, the weakest members of any\r\nsociety, be it in the North or the South of our planet, that\r\nthe world’s future and hopes depend. They are the weakest\r\nmembers of any society. They are little people who need\r\nbig rights. How much worse off would they be if there\r\nwere no United Nations? What would become of the\r\nworld’s conscience? Who would demand consideration for\r\nand solidarity with such children if we allowed this\r\nOrganization to decline?\r\nAt this moment about 25,000 soldiers, civilians and\r\nmembers of non-governmental organizations are serving the\r\ncause of peace around the globe. All of them deserve our\r\nthanks and appreciation.\r\nA week ago today five Germans, including the Deputy\r\nof the High Representative, Ambassador Gerd Wagner, five\r\nAmericans, a Briton and a Pole lost their lives in a tragic\r\naccident. We mourn their loss and share the grief of their\r\nfamilies. Their deaths are an admonition to redouble our\r\nefforts for peace. They wanted to help people in need and\r\nin doing so brought a ray of hope to Bosnia and to the\r\npeople working on the ground. That hope must not be\r\nextinguished.\r\nLast Saturday I attended the memorial service in\r\nSarajevo. I have visited the region more than once, and the\r\ninner conflict among the people was again obvious. As\r\nbefore, the main obstacles to lasting peace in the region are\r\nhatred and fear among the various ethnic groups. On the\r\nother hand, most Bosnians, in spite of the terrible events of\r\nrecent years, realize there is no future for them and their\r\nchildren if the hatred and fear are not overcome, despite all\r\nthe terrible things that have been done, despite the rapes\r\nand the “ethnic cleansing”.\r\nThat is why I am speaking out here today — to appeal\r\nto all political leaders in Bosnia to change their attitude and\r\nto mount a reconciliation campaign. The international\r\ncommunity has provided assistance, making millions of\r\ndollars available. We have done a lot. We are very\r\ncommitted on the ground, and we want to see the results\r\nof what we have done. We believe that those who live in\r\nsecurity and peace have an obligation to help others.\r\nSo far more than 300 troops have sacrificed their\r\nlives for the cause of peace in Bosnia. My country\r\nalone — Germany — has spent more than 17 billion\r\nmarks on the peace process and on the more than 350,000\r\nasylum-seekers in Germany coming from Kosovo. That is\r\na lot of money, and those on whom we spend it will have\r\nto react in some way and have to give us a clear sign of\r\ntheir willingness to implement the agreements.\r\nBut outside help, including military support, cannot\r\nbe provided indefinitely. And on no account — I want to\r\nbe unequivocal about this — will it be given to those who\r\nthwart peace and reconciliation. Attempts to undermine\r\npeace, to incite the people and to torpedo the\r\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement, especially in\r\nRepublika Srpska — must stop.\r\nI appeal to all political factions in the region to use\r\nwhat time remains to launch a new and serious attempt to\r\nsettle their differences and to see to it that Karadzic and\r\nother alleged war criminals and enemies of peace are\r\nbrought before the Hague Tribunal. These people must\r\nnot be allowed to sleep peacefully. But this demand must\r\nbe made by the international community, not just\r\nGermany: these people must not be allowed to sleep\r\npeacefully.\r\nWe Europeans have done quite a lot this year to\r\nimprove the situation on our continent in order to secure\r\na peaceful future for coming generations. Nations that\r\nbelong together are now growing together, and that in a\r\nregion that for centuries was divided and at war with\r\nitself. The European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization are gradually opening up to Europe’s new\r\ndemocracies, while Russia and Ukraine are forming a\r\nnew, close partnership with both organizations.\r\nAnd let the world be prepared. In 1999 we\r\nEuropeans, right on schedule and in conformity with\r\nbinding stability criteria, will introduce the Euro, the\r\ncommon European currency. The enlargement of the\r\nEuropean Union and the introduction of the Euro are\r\nhistoric steps to safeguard the future for coming\r\ngenerations, steps that hardly anyone would have thought\r\npossible only 10 years ago. And mark my words: there\r\nwill be no going back in Europe.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nAt the same time, we are aware that Europe\r\nconstitutes only a small section of the much larger global\r\nconstruction site. Everywhere the harbingers of the new era\r\nare knocking on the door. Nothing is like it used to be, yet\r\nthe hopes and wishes of citizens everywhere have remained\r\nthe same. They want peace and work. They want a roof\r\nover their heads, protection from crime, and schools for\r\ntheir children.\r\nThus the aims and ideals enshrined in the Charter are\r\njust as valid as they were in 1945: peace, sustainable\r\neconomic and social development, protection of human\r\nrights and democracy. These aims form a whole, and there\r\nis no order of preference.\r\nEighty per cent of United Nations activities focus on\r\nworld poverty, and rightly so, because this is the big\r\nproblem that has remained unsolved since the ending of the\r\nEast-West confrontation. Nearly a quarter of the world’s\r\npopulation — 1.3 billion people — live in poverty, while\r\n840 million suffer from chronic undernourishment. In the\r\nAgenda for Development we have adopted the right course\r\nfor the fight against poverty: good governance, market\r\neconomy, the rule of law, security for the citizen, regional\r\ncooperation and international integration.\r\nFollowing the lead of the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations countries (ASEAN), the Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) and the now-expanding\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC), the\r\nnations of Central America too are forming closer ties. It is\r\nbecoming more and more apparent that this is the path of\r\nprogress. The worldwide trend towards closer multilateral\r\ncooperation is increasing, and will lead to progress, security\r\nand prosperity; it is the path of the future. One the one\r\nhand, the Information Age with undreamed-of possibilities,\r\nand, on the other, exclusive communities and citizens\r\nwithout rights — this does not add up.\r\nYes, globalization is a great leveller. Basically, it\r\nconfronts industrial and developing countries alike with the\r\nsame question: are we going to accept the challenge of\r\nbeing part of a “single world market”, or are we going to\r\nmark time? A good number of newly industrialized and\r\ndeveloping countries have chosen the way forward, and it\r\nhas proved to be the right one. They have received the bulk\r\nof global direct investment, which in 1996 increased by 8\r\nper cent to almost $350 billion. Nor have the others been\r\nforgotten. Within the framework of the G-8 process, the\r\nnew global partnership for development was established on\r\ntheir behalf. A beginning was made at the Denver summit\r\nin June, focusing particularly on the sub-Saharan nations\r\nof Africa.\r\nSince 1978 Germany has cancelled debts incurred by\r\nthe least developed countries and other land-locked\r\ndeveloping countries in Africa amounting to more than 9\r\nbillion marks. These countries will continue to be the\r\nfocal point of our development cooperation. Between\r\n1991 and 1995 Germany made available 16.3 billion\r\nmarks for Africa’s sub-Saharan nations, and we are proud\r\nof that.\r\nI am glad that the Security Council is holding a\r\nspecial meeting tomorrow on the situation in Africa.\r\nMany positive developments have taken place there in\r\nrecent years, a fact that is often overlooked.\r\nBut light and shadow are still very close together. I\r\nneed only mention Congo Brazzaville, Sierra Leone,\r\nSomalia and especially the Great Lakes region. My\r\ncountry, the Federal Republic of Germany, has played a\r\nhumanitarian and political role in all these conflicts, and\r\nwe recognize that the African States themselves — in the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and in the\r\nsubregional organizations — are making significant\r\nefforts to settle these conflicts. We must keep on\r\nsupporting them.\r\nBut Africa’s real problems lie deeper, in the social\r\nand economic sphere, and in the lack of cohesion among\r\nthe different population groups. In my view, Europe’s\r\nvast and important neighbouring continent, which has a\r\npopulation of about 800 million covers about 23 per cent\r\nof the world’s land surface, has little chance of achieving\r\nstability and economic progress unless it follows the path\r\nof regional cooperation. Such cooperation brings stability\r\nwhere nations are too weak to achieve it individually.\r\nSouthern Africa is a good example. At the 1994\r\nBerlin conference, cooperation between the SADC and the\r\nEuropean Union was raised to a new level. At our\r\nmeeting in June we and our African colleagues redefined\r\nthe framework for the dialogue between the European\r\nUnion and the OAU. Europe will stay on Africa’s side.\r\nPart of this support is that we are helping countries\r\nlike Angola and Mozambique to rid themselves of the\r\nscourge of mines. So far mine clearance by hand has\r\nbeen, at least to me, like trying to remove a sand-dune\r\nwith a thimble. We cannot accept that. What we need for\r\nthis task is safe, large-capacity machinery.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nThe Oslo Conference gave rise to a sign of hope.\r\nEighty countries have put their names to a comprehensive\r\nand verifiable ban on anti-personnel mines. I wish to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his personal efforts on this issue.\r\nAnyone who, like me, has seen the poor, crippled victims\r\nin Cambodia, Mozambique or Bosnia knows that these\r\ntreacherous killing devices are wholly — I repeat,\r\nwholly — immoral. I therefore appeal to all countries still\r\non the outside to join the Ottawa process and help us ban\r\nthese infernal devices from the face of the Earth.\r\nThe world, galvanized by the spirit of freedom, has\r\nbeen totally transformed. But this new freedom and its by-\r\nproducts constitute a major test for us all, not only as\r\nregards competitiveness but also as regards our solidarity,\r\nour ability to show tolerance and to work together, and the\r\nopening of markets.\r\nThe East-West conflict has been consigned to the past.\r\nHere too, the question now is: are we going to try and\r\nsafeguard the future for posterity, or are we going to allow\r\nnew enemy stereotypes to divide us once again? There must\r\nbe no clash of civilizations. Hence, the dialogue of\r\ncivilizations and world religions must be raised to a new\r\nlevel. To me this is the spiritual challenge as we approach\r\nthe twenty-first century, for only thus can we bring\r\ndifferent standpoints closer together and mobilize the\r\nenergies needed for the joint resolution of humanity’s\r\ncolossal problems.\r\nI suggest that we hold a forum here at the United\r\nNations to consider how we can generate new momentum\r\nfor this dialogue worldwide. The matter is important\r\nenough. Considerable cultural energy and potential for\r\ninnovation lie unused, and the United Nations is the proper\r\ncatalyst for their development.\r\nBut we must be very clear that there cannot and\r\nshould not be dialogue with terrorists. Terrorism has again\r\nraised its ugly head in Mostar, Jerusalem and Cairo. The\r\nvileness of the latest carnage in Algeria would be difficult\r\nto exceed: it really does take your breath away. How long\r\ncan the international community look away? I know how\r\ndifficult it is to help from the outside, but the world\r\ncommunity cannot accept the cruel killing of utterly\r\ninnocent people in the dark of night without standing up\r\nand reacting. We are not powerless in the face of such evil\r\nslaughter of mostly uninvolved persons. In Denver, the\r\nGroup of Eight called upon all nations to sign the\r\ninternational conventions on terrorism. We must resolutely\r\ncombat terrorism all over the world, using all democratic\r\nmeans at our disposal. I call upon the General Assembly to\r\ncomplete by the end of this session the negotiations on a\r\nconvention against terrorist bomb attacks, as proposed by\r\nthe Group of Eight.\r\nExtradition or suitable punishment remains the\r\nprinciple underlying our efforts to combat terrorism. No\r\none should give refuge to terrorists. We need a united\r\nglobal front against terrorism. To combat fanatical killers\r\nwe can only consistently apply the law as well as police\r\nand judicial measures. The source of sympathy for\r\nterrorist objectives must be withered by political means.\r\nIn other words, we must get to the roots, which in most\r\ncases are social problems.\r\nOn my last visit to the Middle East I spoke with\r\nmany citizens in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Hebron, and\r\nin the refugee camps in Gaza. I sensed their fears and\r\nconcerns. Those who have seen the wretched conditions\r\nin the camps know that these people must be given a\r\nchance to improve their lives. They need to be able to\r\nhope again that the peace process is something from\r\nwhich they will benefit, that the violence will stop, that\r\nthey can find work and have enough to eat, and that their\r\nchildren can go to school.\r\nFor these hopes to materialize, both sides must show\r\na large measure of good will. President Arafat must do\r\neverything in his power to stop the terrorism. And the\r\nIsraeli Government must desist from any measures which\r\ncause the Palestinians to doubt Israel’s commitment to\r\npeace. The settlements issue remains the crucial test here;\r\nat least, that is what I believe. Continuing to build in Har\r\nHoma only makes matters worse, so a moratorium is\r\nessential. To my mind, this is the only way to reopen the\r\ndoor to peace talks.\r\nAs for Iran, the new Government has changed its\r\ntone. It remains to be seen whether this will lead to a\r\nnew, constructive policy, especially with regard to the\r\nMiddle East peace process, human rights and international\r\nlaw. Germany has always maintained close and friendly\r\nrelations with the Iranian people, and in spite of all that\r\nhas happened, in spite of the Mykonos affair, we are\r\nready for talks. It is up to the Iranian Government to\r\nprovide the basis on which these can take place.\r\nWe are pleased that Mrs. Robinson has taken up her\r\npost as the new High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nNowhere is the need for a new culture of dialogue so\r\ngreat, we believe, as in the process of protecting such\r\nrights. This is crucial to world peace and global\r\ndevelopment. Any society that fails to respect human\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nrights, which include the right of development, is blocking\r\nits own progress. Our policy on this matter is based on\r\ndialogue and respect for different cultures. But we also\r\nagree with Pope John Paul II, who has said that if we want\r\npeace we must respect the conscience of the people. No\r\ncivilization or religion denies people their rights or\r\napproves of murder and torture. Nor can any such action be\r\njustified on political grounds.\r\nWe need an international criminal court of justice. The\r\nstatute of such a court is to be drawn up in Rome next\r\nsummer. The court must be empowered to act of its own\r\naccord where genocide, crimes against humanity, war\r\ncrimes and wars of aggression are concerned, and to do so\r\nwherever national courts either do not exist or cannot or are\r\nunwilling to prosecute such crimes. The terrible genocides\r\nin Rwanda and Srbrenica are warning signs. Such cardinal\r\ncrimes should not go unpunished.\r\nOur responsibility towards future generations is\r\nparticularly acute where protection of the natural sources of\r\nlife is concerned. That is why it is crucial to maintain the\r\nspirit engendered by the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, the Rio Summit. That is the\r\npurpose of the environment initiative put forward by\r\nChancellor Kohl together with Brazil, South Africa and\r\nSingapore.\r\nThe climate conference to be held in Kyoto in\r\nDecember will be a major test of the industrial world’s\r\ncommitment to the environment. Germany intends to reduce\r\nits greenhouse-gas emissions by 25 per cent by the year\r\n2010, based on 1990 levels. We and our partners in the\r\nEuropean Union are asking the other industrial countries to\r\ncut theirs by at least 15 per cent. That would go part of the\r\nway towards meeting our responsibility towards posterity.\r\nWhen we look at the air pollution in southern Asia,\r\nwe cannot fail to admit that we urgently need to agree on\r\na forest convention. We must put an end to the ruthless\r\nburning of forests to clear vast areas of land. Those who\r\ndeplete and destroy their own natural resources will make\r\nus all lose out in the end. The eleventh hour is approaching.\r\nTwo weeks from now the decision on where to locate\r\nthe secretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification\r\nwill be taken in Rome. We ask members to vote for Bonn.\r\nSince the secretariat of the Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change already has its headquarters there, it makes\r\nsense to combine the two.\r\nThe General Assembly is at a crossroads. Either we\r\nsolve our reform problems now and come out of our\r\nintrospective shell, or the United Nations will lose\r\npolitical standing — that is what would happen. All\r\nregional organizations, industrial, developing and\r\nnon-aligned countries have a joint responsibility for\r\nimplementing the reforms we have been talking about for\r\nso long. This applies to all areas of United Nations\r\nactivity: economic and social, Security Council and\r\nfinance.\r\nThe Secretary-General has submitted a bold package\r\nof reforms. Even though we do not agree with every\r\ndetail, we support the package as a whole. I appeal to all\r\nMember States: let us not talk it to shreds, but make\r\nquick decisions so that the necessary measures can be put\r\ninto effect. The United Nations has to be streamlined in\r\norder to increase its efficiency. Whatever savings are\r\nmade through reform should be used for developments-\r\nassistance purposes.\r\nThe Security Council must reflect today’s political\r\nrealities, one of which is the greater status of Africa,\r\nAsia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The debate on\r\nthis matter should not be artificially prolonged. This the\r\nmost important body of the United Nations, and it cannot\r\ncredibly and effectively perform its role as the guardian\r\nof peace in the twenty-first century if its composition\r\nremains basically as it was in 1945.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that a large number of States\r\nregard the reunited Germany as a suitable candidate for a\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council. If elected, we\r\nwill be able to make a good contribution, one that is in\r\nkeeping with the spirit of the Charter.\r\nTwo years ago, on the Organization’s fiftieth\r\nbirthday, we solemnly pledged to hand on to the next\r\nmillennium a United Nations equipped and funded for its\r\ntask. That promise has to be kept, and it has to be kept by\r\nall. This means, first and foremost, paying our\r\ncontributions in full and on time, because without\r\nfinances this Organization is a powerless one. The\r\nEuropean Union has submitted its proposal for changing\r\nthe scale of assessments, the purpose of which is to\r\nensure a fair distribution of burdens.\r\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights reads,\r\n“All human beings are born free and\r\nequal in dignity and rights. They are endowed\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nwith reason and conscience and should act\r\ntowards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”\r\nThis vision must be sustained: the vision of a world in\r\nwhich it is not the law of the strongest, but the strength of\r\nthe law which prevails; a world in which both the strong\r\nand the weak feel at home; a world fit to live in which we\r\ncan safely leave to our children and to our grandchildren.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Vice-Premier\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, His Excellency\r\nMr. Qian Qichen. I give him the floor.\r\nMr. Qian Qichen (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): Please allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits current session. I believe your wisdom and experience\r\nwill enable you to accomplish your lofty mission with\r\ndistinction. At the same time, I would like to express my\r\nappreciation to Mr. Razali Ismail for his contribution as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its last session.\r\nThis year, 1997, is no ordinary year for China. Last\r\nFebruary, when Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of\r\nChina’s reform and opening-up, passed away, the 1.2\r\nbillion Chinese people were immersed in deep sorrow.\r\nTurning grief into strength, we are determined to heed his\r\nbehest by deepening reform, opening the country still wider\r\nto the outside world, stepping up national development and\r\npromoting the cause of world peace. Here, on behalf of the\r\nChinese Government and people, I would like once again\r\nto thank the United Nations and its Member States for the\r\nsincere condolences they expressed on the passing of Deng\r\nXiaoping. Your kind words gave us strength at our time of\r\nbereavement.\r\nJust a few days ago, the Fifteenth National Congress\r\nof the Communist Party of China came to a triumphant\r\nconclusion in Beijing. This Congress, holding high the great\r\nbanner of Deng Xiaoping theory, charts the future course of\r\nChina’s development with a blueprint and displays the\r\nresolve to carry forward the cause of building socialism\r\nwith Chinese characteristics well into the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nOn 1 July of this year, China resumed its exercise of\r\nsovereignty over Hong Kong, which wiped out our national\r\nhumiliation of one and a half centuries and opened up a\r\nnew chapter in our peaceful reunification. During the more\r\nthan two months since its return, Hong Kong has enjoyed\r\nsocial stability and economic prosperity, which fills the\r\npeople of Hong Kong, of China and of the world at large\r\nwith great joy.\r\nThe realization of Deng Xiaoping’s concept of “one\r\ncountry, two systems” in Hong Kong carries profound\r\nsignificance. Firmly adhering to this concept, we will\r\nkeep up the peaceful reunification of our motherland by\r\nensuring a smooth return of Macao and eventually\r\nresolving the Taiwan question. Taiwan is an inalienable\r\npart of Chinese territory, and the Taiwan question is\r\npurely an internal affair of China. Any country that\r\nattempts to use the Taiwan question to put pressure on\r\nChina or even clamours for “two Chinas” or “one China,\r\none Taiwan” has acted in total contravention of the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and\r\nthe relevant General Assembly resolutions. Such\r\nbehaviour will be absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese\r\npeople, as well as to all the countries upholding justice in\r\nthe world.\r\nAs the international situation continues to undergo\r\nprofound changes, peace and development have become\r\nthe main themes of our times. The world is evolving\r\ntowards multipolarity with growing diversity in countries’\r\npolitical, economic and cultural lives. This trend has\r\nbecome an irresistible tide of history.\r\nThe two world wars in the first half of the twentieth\r\ncentury plunged mankind into unprecedented havoc. And\r\nthe cold war, which lasted for more than four decades in\r\nthe latter half of our century, kept humanity in the dark\r\nshadow of war. Reviewing the past and looking to the\r\nfuture, people throughout the world are anxiously waiting\r\nfor the establishment of a just and equitable new\r\ninternational political and economic order, and they are\r\nhoping to see lasting peace and prosperity for all in the\r\ncoming century.\r\nThe cold-war security regime that featured military\r\nalliances and the arms race is, as has been proved,\r\nincapable of making peace. Expanding military blocs and\r\nenhancing military alliances under new circumstances can\r\ndo little to bring about greater security. Relations between\r\nStates should be based on the five principles of mutual\r\nrespect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual\r\nnon-aggression, non-interference in each other’s internal\r\naffairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful\r\ncoexistence. Each country has the right to choose a road\r\nof development according to its own national conditions,\r\nand no country should interfere in the internal affairs of\r\nother countries on whatever grounds. This must serve as\r\nthe political prerequisite for global and regional security.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nAll countries should increase their mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation in the economic field, eliminate unequal\r\npractices in trade and economic relations, and do away with\r\ndiscriminatory policies with a view to gradually narrowing\r\nthe gap between the rich and the poor and achieving\r\ncommon prosperity. This should serve as the economic\r\nfoundation for global and regional security.\r\nAll countries should step up consultation and\r\ncooperation in the security field, increase mutual\r\nunderstanding and trust, and undertake to settle through\r\npeaceful means, whatever differences and disputes they may\r\nhave. This is the practical way to achieve global and\r\nregional security.\r\nIn the first half of the year, five countries — China,\r\nRussia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan — signed\r\nthe agreement on mutual reduction of military forces in the\r\nborder areas; the four-party talks aimed at bringing about a\r\nnew peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula were\r\nlaunched; and the Regional Forum of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) introduced a\r\npreliminary form of cooperation on security issues featuring\r\nequal participation and negotiated consensus. These are\r\nsome of the examples of searching for new models of\r\nsecurity cooperation and of the initial progress already\r\nmade.\r\nWe feel concerned about the recent setbacks in the\r\nMiddle East peace process. We are of the view that the\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions should be complied\r\nwith, agreements reached among the parties concerned in\r\nthe peace process should be honoured, the principle of land\r\nfor peace should be adhered to, and terrorist activities\r\nshould stop. We hope that the parties concerned will work\r\ntogether on that basis so that the Madrid Peace Conference\r\non peace in the Middle East will resume at an early date.\r\nWe are also deeply concerned about the incessant conflicts\r\nand turmoil which have plagued Africa since the beginning\r\nof this year, and wish the African countries steady progress\r\nalong the road of peace and development.\r\nThe past year has seen new progress in the field of\r\ninternational arms control and disarmament. The Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention has entered into force; the Preparatory\r\nCommittee of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nhas started its work; the extent of nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzones is increasing; and negotiations on the efficacy of the\r\nBiological Weapons Convention have made further\r\nheadway.\r\nIn our view, no one should try to monopolize the\r\nmarket in the name of preventing proliferation or try to\r\ninterfere in the economic and technological cooperation of\r\nother countries, developing countries in particular. An\r\noverhaul of the discriminatory and exclusive\r\nnon-proliferation regimes and arrangements is thus\r\nnecessary, on the basis of universal participation, and the\r\nUnited Nations should see to it that it accomplishes\r\nsomething in this regard.\r\nWe maintain that continued efforts should be made\r\nto advance the process of multilateral arms control and\r\ndisarmament. The universality of international arms-\r\ncontrol treaties should be strengthened and complete\r\nadherence to them ensured. Instead of weakening and\r\nundermining security, arms-control and disarmament\r\nefforts should reinforce it. The target of disarmament\r\nshould not be shifted to developing countries, as countries\r\nwith the largest and most sophisticated arsenals bear a\r\nspecial responsibility for disarmament.\r\nI would also like to draw the Assembly’s attention\r\nto China’s recent announcement of a unilateral step of\r\ndisarmament — that is, having reduced its troop strength\r\nby 1 million in the 1980s, China will further reduce its\r\nmilitary by 500,000 troops within the next three years.\r\nThis is a move of major significance in the field of\r\ndisarmament.\r\nIn the past year, the overall situation of the world\r\neconomy has been good. Economic links and mutual\r\npenetration among countries and regions are on the\r\nconstant increase. The importance of international\r\ncooperation should be given a fresh evaluation with a\r\nview to making it broader, closer and more fruitful.\r\nDeveloping countries are most vulnerable to the\r\nimpact of adverse environmental conditions because of\r\ntheir weak economic foundations. At present, the\r\ninternational financial market is highly globalized and\r\nvery risky. We should work to stabilize the financial\r\nmarket and ensure steady economic growth of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe Uruguay Round agreements should be\r\nimplemented in a comprehensive, faithful and balanced\r\nmanner, and attempts to impose a linkage between\r\nenvironmental or labour standards and trade must be\r\nopposed.\r\nEnvironment and development pose a common\r\nchallenge to mankind. The United Nations has held two\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nimportant conferences in the 1990s, setting forth a set of\r\nguiding principles for the solution of the issue. We hope the\r\ninternational community, developed countries in particular,\r\nwill honour its pledges to provide funds and transfer\r\ntechnology to the developing countries so as to translate the\r\ndeclaration of partnership into real action.\r\nMany transboundary issues, such as poverty,\r\nunemployment, refugees, drugs and crime, need to be\r\naddressed through consultation by the international\r\ncommunity. The work of the United Nations in the social\r\nfield needs to be strengthened. All countries should, in\r\nkeeping with the principles of mutual respect, equality and\r\nmutual benefit, endeavour to promote international\r\ncooperation. They should get down to practical tasks, the\r\nfirst of which is to help developing countries deal with their\r\nmost urgent difficulties. We hope that the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly on international drug control,\r\nscheduled for next year, will yield positive results by\r\nformulating a cross-century strategy for combating drug-\r\nrelated crimes through strengthened international\r\ncooperation along with effective measures of\r\nimplementation.\r\nChina will continue to support the United Nations in\r\nits work in the social field and will make a greater\r\ncontribution to social progress around the world.\r\nThe realization of human rights is the common ideal\r\nof mankind. All countries have made great efforts to this\r\nend, with both achievements and lessons. We maintain that\r\nthe universality of human rights should be respected; yet\r\ntheir realization must be integrated with the conditions of\r\neach country. A review of United Nations practice over the\r\npast 50 years and more shows that when countries or\r\nregions do this they will enjoy social stability, economic\r\ndevelopment and popular contentment. When they do not,\r\nsociety will face disintegration, with people losing their\r\nmost basic human rights and freedoms, and gross violations\r\nof human rights will even take place when chaos erupts as\r\na result of war.\r\nWe say it is quite natural for people to differ on the\r\nhuman rights issue. The question is how to deal with these\r\ndifferences. Which is the better approach: dialogue or\r\nconfrontation? I opt for dialogue. Only dialogue can\r\nenhance mutual understanding and cooperation.\r\nConfrontation, on the other hand, can only lead to further\r\nestrangement and do nobody any good. We are pleased to\r\nsee that more and more countries are in favour of dialogue\r\nin handling the human rights issue.\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches importance to\r\nhuman rights and is dedicated to promoting and protecting\r\nhuman rights of its people. Having repeatedly suffered\r\nfrom foreign aggression in the past, the Chinese people\r\nknow full well how state sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity fundamentally guarantee the realization of their\r\nhuman rights. We in China — taking upon ourselves the\r\ntask of feeding, clothing, sheltering and educating, and\r\nproviding travel facilities to, our 1.2 billion people —\r\nknow full well how vitally important our right to\r\nsubsistence and our right to development are. To enable\r\nour people to lead a freer, happier and more democratic\r\nlife, we are focusing above all on the development of our\r\neconomy and on advancing democracy and our legal\r\nsystem.\r\nChina will soon sign the International Covenant on\r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and is studying\r\nearnestly the International Covenant on Civil and Political\r\nRights. We stand ready to work with other countries in a\r\ncontinued effort to promote cooperation in the\r\ninternational human rights field.\r\nAs the most important intergovernmental\r\norganization in the world, the United Nations occupies an\r\nirreplaceable position in international life. At the same\r\ntime, an evolving situation calls for reform of the United\r\nNations.\r\nLast July, Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted\r\nan extensive report on the reform of the United Nations.\r\nWe appreciate his effort.\r\nWe are in favour of reforming the United Nations.\r\nThe purpose of such reform is to strengthen the role of\r\nthe United Nations and enhance its efficiency. Measures\r\ntaken in this regard must reflect the common interests of\r\nall Member States and the results must be able to stand\r\nthe test of time. To this end, we offer the following\r\nviews.\r\nUnited Nations reform is the shared cause of all\r\nMember States. It should allow full play to democracy,\r\nheed the voices of all sides and take into account the\r\ninterests of various parties. The reform plan should be\r\nwidely acceptable to Member States.\r\nTo enhance efficiency, an appropriate reduction of\r\npersonnel and expenditure is necessary. What is\r\nimportant, however, is for the reform to put greater\r\nemphasis on development issues with a view to\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nstrengthening rather than weakening the United Nations role\r\nin the promotion of economic and social development.\r\nThe reform should help preserve the diversity in the\r\nUnited Nations, which is a microcosm of the diversity of\r\nthe world. Only when world diversity is recognized and\r\nrespected can different countries live in harmony and make\r\nprogress together.\r\nThe reform should stress practical results, place value\r\non quality, and progress in an incremental manner.\r\nThe enlargement of the Security Council should follow\r\nthe principle of equitable geographical distribution and\r\nensure a proper balance between developing and developed\r\ncountries. The Security Council will better perform the lofty\r\nmission entrusted to it under the United Nations Charter\r\nonly when it becomes more broadly representative.\r\nPayment of assessed dues is the bounden duty of\r\nevery Member State under the Charter of the United\r\nNations. We urge the countries concerned to pay off their\r\narrears without conditions and as early as possible in order\r\nto put the United Nations on a sound financial basis for\r\nnormal operation.\r\nCountries around the world need the United Nations.\r\nSo does the United Nations need their support.\r\nThe President (interpretation from French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister of Foreign Affairs of France, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Hubert Védrine, and I now call upon him.\r\nMr. Védrine (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nMay I first say, Sir, how pleased my country is at your\r\nelection as President of the fifty-second session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. I should also like to say\r\nto the Secretary-General that France welcomes the action he\r\nhas already taken and assure him that he has our support\r\nand confidence.\r\nI shall begin my statement by expressing a conviction\r\non behalf of my country: the world needs the United\r\nNations more than ever. No, the United Nations did not\r\nlose its raison d\u0027être with the end of the cold war, the end\r\nof the arms race between the two blocs and the head-on\r\nclash of differing ideologies.\r\nMr. Arias (Panama), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nOn the contrary, the need for a universal regulating\r\nbody has never been so apparent. The reasons are known to\r\nall. Without regret, we left the era of bipolar confrontation\r\nto enter, in 1991, a new, global, evolving world in which\r\n185 States cooperate, make alliances with one another or\r\ncompete in stable or, conversely, unstable combinations.\r\nIn this world, States are no longer the sole players. The\r\ngiant conglomerates, the financial markets, the media,\r\nopinion groups and non-governmental organizations all\r\nplay an increasing role. Because of this, there is an\r\noverriding need for clear, fair and predictable ground\r\nrules to establish a framework for settling conflicts or\r\nmere differences. For, nowadays, no serious problem can\r\nbe resolved by one country, even the most powerful,\r\nentirely on its own.\r\nUnless we take care, unless we manage to build a\r\nworld in which the rule of law prevails among all States,\r\na world in equilibrium between its major centres of\r\npower, other scenarios will ensue: the absence of a\r\ncounterweight will encourage the predominance of a\r\nsingle Power, and, inevitably, that Power will be tempted\r\nto engage in unilateralism; for want of organized regional\r\nentities, globalization will exacerbate the economic — and\r\nsometimes political — struggle of each against all; States\r\nwill find themselves further weakened, and some will\r\nimplode under the effects of aggressive nationalism,\r\nwhich is often contagious. Fierce competition will render\r\nvirtually impossible environmental conservation, however\r\nurgent, however vital in the true meaning of the word, as\r\nwell as the fight against drugs and crime; greater respect\r\nfor human rights will be compromised.\r\nOur common task must be to forestall such dangers\r\nand, at the same time, to consolidate, together, the\r\nachievements of recent years. For this, regional groupings\r\nare one of the best possible foundations. Europe, which\r\nhas been the crucible of so many wars, has been showing\r\nthe way for half a century. The growth rates achieved by\r\nmany countries in Asia, in Latin America and now in\r\nAfrica, announce the emergence of new centres of power\r\nand prosperity. Political and economic entities are being\r\norganized and institutionalized: South-East Asia meets in\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN);\r\nin Latin America, the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR) is developing, as are the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) in southern Africa and\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\n(ECOWAS) in the west of that continent. To some extent,\r\none might also include cultural and political entities, such\r\nas the Commonwealth and la Francophonie. This is a\r\nsensible way to adapt to globalization.\r\nHowever, at the global level we need a coherent,\r\neffective United Nations with the resources necessary to\r\ncarry out its missions. It is the task of this body to facilitate\r\nthe smooth organization of international relations and to\r\ndetermine universally recognized rules of law. To be sure,\r\nother organizations exist in various sectors, and these have\r\ntheir own, very important areas of authority. But none of\r\nthem can take the place of the United Nations in giving the\r\nworld of tomorrow a set of comprehensive rules. True to its\r\ntradition, France will support all the Organization\u0027s efforts\r\nto that end.\r\nI come now to the main object of the session which is\r\nbeginning. To carry out the major role we expect of it, the\r\nUnited Nations must retain or reacquire the means to take\r\ndecisions and to act. For this, we must resolve two matters:\r\nUnited Nations reform and the financing of the\r\nOrganization. The ability of the United Nations to act in the\r\nyears ahead will depend on the solutions we find together.\r\nFrance approved of the move by the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral at the outset of his mandate to continue the study\r\ninitiated by his predecessor, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\r\nThe main lines Mr. Kofi Annan has proposed for the work\r\nand the impetus he has given to the process of revamping\r\nthe Organization have received France’s full support, a\r\nsupport shared by France’s partners in the European Union.\r\nThe remarks made from this rostrum by its current\r\nPresident, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg,\r\nillustrate this. I should like to comment more specifically\r\non three points: the Security Council, financial reform and\r\nrestructuring.\r\nThe current composition of the Security Council no\r\nlonger accurately reflects the political geography of today’s\r\nworld. Clearly, it has to be reformed — that is to say,\r\nenlarged — to become more representative.\r\nIn this connection, we must take into account the\r\nSecurity Council’s indispensable role in peacekeeping and\r\nthus elect countries able to contribute to this task, whether\r\nthey are from the North or the South.\r\nAccordingly, my country is in favour of the accession\r\nof Germany, Japan and three countries from the South to\r\npermanent seats and the establishment of new\r\nnon-permanent seats. For a Security Council composed\r\nsolely of the principal countries of the North would not\r\nbe representative. Nor should we forget that, once it is\r\nenlarged, and hence more representative, the Council will\r\nstill have to be effective. That is essential.\r\nThe proposals that have been submitted to us should\r\nmake it possible to move forward. However, we are all\r\naware that no consensus has yet been reached and that\r\ndebates on this matter will be difficult. National interests\r\nand the concerns of regional groups must be given due\r\nconsideration. In any event, I welcome President Razali’s\r\nperseverance throughout the fifty-first session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly, which made it possible\r\nto draft a solid working basis from which we must now\r\nproceed to work to find a solution.\r\nFurthermore, financial reform of the United Nations\r\nis a particularly complex issue. It is shocking that the\r\nUnited Nations should be in a precarious state and\r\ntherefore in a situation of financial and budgetary\r\ndependence with respect to its debtors. I believe that we\r\nwill be able to move towards a solution on the basis of\r\nthree principles: what is owed to the United Nations must\r\nbe paid in full, on time and without conditions. Finally,\r\nthe payment of contributions should not be a way of\r\nexerting pressure on the Secretary-General and the other\r\nMember States.\r\nWith these rudimentary principles as a basis, France\r\nis open to discussion on all aspects of the problem. We\r\nwill have to decide on the scale for apportioning\r\nassessments among all States. There is no perfect scale,\r\nbut some are not as bad as others. The concept of each\r\nState’s ability to pay, which has enjoyed consensus since\r\nthe outset, still seems simple, logical and fair today. On\r\nthat basis, a solution can be found that takes account of\r\nthe needs and interests of each State. France will do its\r\nutmost to facilitate the settlement of the financial crisis.\r\nWe can be both imaginative and conciliatory — like the\r\nEuropean Union’s plan. But our efforts will succeed only\r\nif there is respect for the rules I have just recalled, which\r\nreflect our Organization\u0027s impartiality and credibility. If\r\nthe United Nations were forced to comply with the\r\nunilateral demands of one among us, in regard both to its\r\nfinancing and its functioning, then how could it convince\r\nanyone in the future that it is impartial and faithful to the\r\nprinciple of the equality of all under the Charter, and\r\ngenerate respect for its decisions?\r\nI come now to restructuring. The Secretary-General\r\nhas undertaken to restructure and regroup the\r\nOrganization’s institutions. France appreciates the logic of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nthis approach. It therefore welcomes the establishment in\r\nVienna of a centre to deal specifically with combating new\r\ntransnational dangers such as organized crime, drug\r\ntrafficking and terrorism, problems that we must fight with\r\never-increased vigour. It is also very much in favour of\r\nintegrating the Office of the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights and the Centre for Human Rights into a single entity\r\nin Geneva where the main humanitarian aid services are\r\nalready established. It also hopes that the main issues\r\ninvolving disarmament can continue to be addressed in\r\nGeneva.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I applaud the appointment of\r\nMrs. Mary Robinson to the post of High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights. Her very strong personality is\r\ncommensurate with the challenges her task entails. The\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, starting on 10 December this\r\nyear, will provide an opportunity to reaffirm, in the face of\r\npersistent violations and ever-recurring acts of barbarism,\r\nthe universality of these rights. But we will also have to ask\r\nourselves, in addition to making the usual declarations that\r\nare still necessary, what political and economic actions are\r\nneeded to make real headway, in specific situations,\r\ntowards respect for human rights, and how the emergence\r\nof democracies can be encouraged from outside.\r\nThe United Nations, while adapting, must remain the\r\npreferred instrument for taking action in the interests of\r\npeace. At this time, the United Nations is really the only\r\norganization that can try to bring order to an international\r\nsociety which is becoming fragmented and globalized at the\r\nsame time. The United Nations is faced with both a\r\nresurgence of every kind of micro-nationalism and the\r\nstrengthening of regional entities. Most conflicts are now\r\nnot between States but within them. Given these new\r\nchallenges, the United Nations has already demonstrated\r\nhow adaptable and flexible it is. But we must continue. To\r\nensure the lasting settlement of conflicts, consciences have\r\nto be assuaged and justice needs to be done to put an end\r\nto the endless cycle of revenge. The perpetrators of the\r\nmost serious crimes must be tried impartially, with respect\r\nfor the rights of the defence, and after an exemplary\r\ninvestigation which reveals the facts in full. This is why\r\nFrance supports the action of the international criminal\r\ntribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and hopes\r\nthat the forthcoming conference on an international criminal\r\ncourt will be a success.\r\nSince the beginning of the decade, the Organization’s\r\nactions to promote peace and international stability have\r\nchanged radically. The time has passed when large-scale\r\npeacekeeping operations were mounted solely under the\r\nblue flag of the United Nations, in Cambodia and the\r\nformer Yugoslavia for example, in order to take on\r\nmassive challenges alone. Today, the United Nations\r\nintervenes more and more frequently in conjunction with\r\nother organizations or by authorizing the action of\r\nregional actors. In Europe, the United Nations is pooling\r\nits efforts with those of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization in sensitive theatres of operation, and even\r\nwith those of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe. In Africa, for the first time, the\r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) have in the past\r\nyear appointed a joint special representative in the person\r\nof Ambassador Sahnoun, in the Great Lakes region. It is\r\ngood that these two organizations are working together.\r\nThis development must be encouraged. We must also help\r\nAfrican States and organizations to strengthen their own\r\npeacekeeping capabilities. To this end, countries outside\r\nthe African continent must pool their efforts and not\r\nmultiply the number of rival and sometimes redundant\r\ninitiatives. For instance, the Government of France, the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the United States recently agreed to\r\nact together with all those who wish to do so to\r\nstrengthen the peacekeeping capabilities of African\r\ncountries, under the auspices of the United Nations, of\r\ncourse, and in cooperation with the OAU.\r\nBut, in France\u0027s view, encouraging Africa to become\r\nmore involved in resolving crises certainly does not mean\r\nthat the international community should relinquish its\r\nother responsibilities with regard to the African continent.\r\nIt is therefore essential that the United Nations be ready,\r\nonce the declared conditions are met, to act in Congo-\r\nBrazzaville. By the same token, the many recent tragedies\r\nin the Great Lakes region make sustained international\r\ninvolvement indispensable. This United Nations\r\ncommitment to promote peace and development must also\r\nserve to further human rights. That is why it is important\r\nfor the humanitarian investigative task force in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to be able to carry out\r\nits mission. I might add that by spending too much time\r\ntalking about crises in Africa, one might forget the\r\nessential point, namely that the African continent is taking\r\noff in quite an unprecedented way. My country believes\r\nin this.\r\nWe are all still mobilized by the situation in the\r\nMiddle East. The peace process, set in train on the\r\ninitiative of clear-sighted and courageous men on both\r\nsides, raised tremendous hopes. We can clearly see the\r\nincreasingly tragic consequences to which the current\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nstalemate would lead, were it to last. The peoples of this\r\nregion are once again stuck in an impasse, in a situation of\r\nhumiliation, resentment, and the fear of terrorism. New\r\nefforts are therefore necessary so that these two peoples,\r\nIsraeli and Palestinian, which are matched in terms of\r\ninsecurity and fear of the future, can together find justice\r\nand security. France gave its full support to the action by\r\nthe American Secretary of State, who recently went to the\r\nMiddle East. Indeed, the United States has a special\r\nresponsibility and special means to attempt to reinvigorate\r\nthe peace process and effectively combat the deadly acts of\r\nextremism. France and Europe are ready to take part in any\r\nconstructive move to this end.\r\nWhat can the United Nations do? It cannot take the\r\nplace of the parties concerned, which have the primary\r\nresponsibility. It is up to the Organization to state, or\r\nrestate, the law and to recall the principles which must be\r\nthe basis for any peace if we want it to last. I refer here to\r\nthe resolutions adopted by the Security Council on the\r\nconflict in the Middle East, not forgetting resolution 425\r\n(1978), which deals with the integrity of Lebanon in\r\nparticular.\r\nMany other crisis situations where the wounds have\r\nnot healed could be mentioned from this rostrum — so\r\ndiverse is the work of the United Nations. In particular, I\r\nam thinking of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nwhere security has been restored but where the construction\r\nof a State with viable democratic institutions remains\r\nuncertain; and of Albania, where the new stability, thanks\r\nto resolute European action authorized by the United\r\nNations, is giving rise to new hopes. I am also thinking of\r\nthe tenacious efforts of the United Nations to contain or\r\ndefuse the crises in Haiti, Cyprus, Georgia, Afghanistan,\r\nTajikistan and elsewhere.\r\nFinally, let us not forget, now or ever, much-needed\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nOf course, the insertion of emerging economies,\r\nincluding the former underdeveloped economies, into the\r\nglobal economy is an excellent thing; indeed, past efforts in\r\nthis regard have proved to be well founded. But this must\r\nnot be a selfish excuse for the rich countries to give up\r\ntheir effort to provide development assistance, which is\r\nequally necessary. In any event, this is very much an\r\nimperative for the leaders of the member States of the\r\nFrancophone community. The summit of these States in\r\nHanoi in November will attest to their interest in more\r\nbalanced development and also to their commitment to\r\nrespecting the multiplicity of cultures and languages.\r\nI will say no more, however — other than to draw\r\none single conclusion. While the world has changed so\r\nmuch over the past 50 years, and even more over the past\r\nsix years, its inhabitants still voice the same needs. The\r\nrule of law must be continually consolidated and the\r\ndemocratic ideal put into practice, faced as we are with\r\nthe temptations of oppression and the use of force, for\r\nwhich new pretexts are constantly being invoked. How\r\ncan we be sure that the factors that make for war and\r\nchaos are banned for ever from all continents, including\r\nEurope?\r\nAt this moment of our Organization\u0027s reform, let us\r\nnot forget the lessons of history. Only international\r\ndialogue, the common management of crises, beginning\r\nwith their prevention, and the wise conservation of the\r\nearth’s resources make it possible for the voice of reason\r\nand peace to prevail and for confidence in progress to be\r\nrebuilt. The United Nations is the right and the only\r\nlegitimate forum for such international discussions, and\r\nthe only one where they are universal. Our Organization\r\nis an irreplaceable framework and a vital necessity for us\r\nall. In the past, it has often been able to deter, address,\r\nresolve and prevent. Let us reform it so as to make it\r\neven more useful.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Angel Gurria, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Mexico.\r\nMr. Gurria (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nLet me first of all congratulate the President on his well-\r\ndeserved election. It is a source of satisfaction to us that\r\nthe President of his country, Ukraine, Mr. Leonid\r\nKuchma, is on this very day starting a state visit to\r\nMexico.\r\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, we\r\nextend our sincere gratitude for the extremely dynamic\r\nway in which he is discharging his important\r\nresponsibilities, and particularly for his significant\r\ncontribution to the process of reform of the Organization.\r\nThe work of this session of the General Assembly\r\nwill cover the main items on the international agenda.\r\nAllow me to begin this statement by referring to those\r\nwhich are of particular significance to my country.\r\nIn relation to the topic of disarmament, significant\r\nsteps have recently been taken. Some prominent ones\r\nhave been the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty, the approval of a Convention prohibiting\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nanti-personnel mines, and the forthcoming conclusion of an\r\ninter-American convention against the illicit traffic in arms,\r\nmunitions and explosives.\r\nAlso prominent at the regional level are the efforts the\r\nRio Group has decided to undertake towards beginning\r\nconsultations with a view to establishing criteria for self-\r\nregulation in the purchase and transfer of certain types of\r\nsophisticated conventional weapons. Latin America is one\r\nof the regions with the lowest military expenditures in the\r\nworld, and there will be no grounds for asserting that an\r\narms race exists among our countries. There is, nonetheless,\r\nagreement to prevent this from happening, and, accordingly,\r\nwe hope that the meeting to be convened in Cancun next\r\nJanuary by the Rio Group itself, with the participation of all\r\nits member States, will attain its objectives. Despite all\r\nthese advances, we reiterate our concern at the lack of\r\ntangible nuclear disarmament measures, and we stress that\r\nthe issue continues to be the responsibility of the\r\ninternational community as a whole, and not the exclusive\r\nprovince of the nuclear Powers. Accordingly, we regret that\r\nthe advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of\r\n8 July 1996, which called attention to the illegality of the\r\nuse of nuclear weapons and the obligation to negotiate\r\nnuclear disarmament measures, has not been taken into\r\naccount by the main nuclear-weapon States.\r\nIt is appropriate to recall that when the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was indefinitely\r\nextended, a series of commitments was drawn up with a\r\nview to making progress towards nuclear disarmament, but\r\nso far not even the most minimal progress has been made.\r\nIn an effort to break the impasse, Mexico, along with other\r\ncountries, submitted to the Conference on Disarmament in\r\nGeneva a programme of action, in which we called for the\r\nconsideration and analysis of certain concrete disarmament\r\nmeasures with all the seriousness they deserve.\r\nTo the same end, we support increasing the number of\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones, along the lines of the Treaty for\r\nthe Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America —\r\nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco. Mexico will continue to support\r\nthe Brazilian initiative to consolidate the southern\r\nhemisphere as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nWith reference to the Convention banning the use of\r\nanti-personnel mines, it should be pointed out that the\r\nrecent approval of that instrument in Oslo was the\r\nculmination of negotiations which had been conducted for\r\none year within the framework of what is called the Ottawa\r\nprocess, as a result of an initiative by the Core Group\r\nformed by Mexico, Canada and other countries in\r\nOctober 1996. The Government of Mexico considers that\r\nthe use of this category of weapons constitutes a flagrant\r\nviolation of international humanitarian law, and that the\r\nonly viable solution to the problems it poses is the total\r\nabolition of anti-personnel landmines and the destruction\r\nof those currently stockpiled. Mexico welcomes the result\r\nachieved, with the justified hope that the countries which\r\nstill remain outside the process will join in it.\r\nLet us not continue to regard peace as an\r\nunattainable objective or a utopian dream. Peace is not\r\nonly the absence of war, but a way of life which\r\nestablishes as the norm cooperation among free and equal\r\nnations to overcome the problems that plague human\r\nbeings in all corners of the world. Peace is and must be\r\npossible, because it is essential to us.\r\nMexico views drug trafficking as a serious threat to\r\nits national security and to the health of humankind. We\r\nmaintain that this phenomenon promotes violence,\r\ncorruption and other unlawful activities, such as illegal\r\narms-trafficking, money-laundering and the diversion of\r\nchemical precursors.\r\nAmong the possibilities offered by international\r\ncooperation in this sphere, Mexico has been extremely\r\nactive in signing bilateral agreements to combat drug\r\ntrafficking and in participating in forums dealing with the\r\nsubject, such as the Inter-American Commission for Drug\r\nAbuse and the Rio Group. To this must be added the\r\nimportant process initiated by Mexico for the purpose of\r\nholding, in June next year, a special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the consideration of the\r\nworld situation with regard to the illicit drug problem, so\r\nthat concrete measures against drug-trafficking and its\r\nassociated crimes can be agreed upon. We invite all the\r\nMember States of the United Nations to participate\r\nactively at the highest level in that special session.\r\nMexico rejects repressive police measures to prevent\r\nand control migratory flows, convinced as we are that the\r\nuse of such methods, far from resolving problems, clouds\r\nrelations between frontier communities and many times\r\nleads to the abuse and mistreatment of migrants by the\r\nauthorities responsible for applying migration policy.\r\nAs part of an effort to seek multilateral solutions to\r\nthis problem within the framework of the fifty-third\r\nsession of the Commission on Human Rights, the\r\nMexican delegation submitted a draft resolution on\r\nmigrants and human rights, which was adopted by\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nconsensus, both in the Commission and in the Economic\r\nand Social Council.\r\nOn the basis of the Mexican initiative, the\r\nCommission on Human Rights decided to establish a group\r\nof experts to formulate recommendations on strengthening\r\nthe promotion, protection and exercise of these rights. We\r\nhave a well-founded hope that it will be possible to secure\r\nthe establishment of a minimum standard of conduct for\r\ncountries in relation to migrants, regardless of their legal\r\nstatus.\r\nRecently, in the states of Texas and Virginia of the\r\nUnited States of America, two Mexican citizens were\r\nexecuted after all the means of recourse that could be used\r\nto obtain the commutation of their death sentences had been\r\nexhausted. In neither of the two cases was the person\r\nconcerned able to contact the consulate of his country at the\r\ntime he was arrested. This was a flagrant violation of article\r\n36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. This\r\nirregularity probably cost them their lives. There are 35\r\nmore Mexicans who have been sentenced to death in the\r\nUnited States, and a number of them did not have access to\r\nthe consular protection to which they were entitled. The\r\nstate of Texas went so far as to justify the omission by\r\nsaying that it was not a party to the Convention in question.\r\nIn the case of Virginia the State Department of the United\r\nStates offered “profuse apologies” to the Government of\r\nMexico after the Mexican national had been executed.\r\nMexico wishes to denounce, in this highest forum of\r\nmankind, this appalling state of affairs. We shall be seeking\r\nan advisory opinion from the Inter-American Court of\r\nHuman Rights on the legality of applying the death penalty\r\nwhen an international convention that affects due process\r\nhas not been complied with. In our view, this violates the\r\nspirit and letter of the International Covenant on Civil and\r\nPolitical Rights and the American Declaration on the Rights\r\nand Duties of Man, the juridical importance of which has\r\nbeen recognized by the Court to which I have referred.\r\nWe are convinced that at this session of the General\r\nAssembly — imbued with new leadership and having\r\nplaced on its agenda a number of reports containing\r\nspecific proposals for progress in the reform process,\r\nincluding the one submitted by the Secretary-General\r\nhimself on 16 July this year — we are at the threshold of\r\na new phase in the Organization\u0027s development.\r\nWith the same resolve with which it has invariably\r\nwelcomed any effort to raise international affairs to the\r\nsphere of law, Mexico, as a founding Member of the\r\nOrganization, reiterates its full readiness to contribute to\r\nthe efforts we shall have to make to face this challenge.\r\nFor a number of years, when the issue of reform was\r\ndiscussed we were content to pursue the rationalization of\r\nthe work of the United Nations through changes which\r\ndid not entail amendments to its founding Charter.\r\nNevertheless, the present juncture is so crucial that we\r\nneed to analyse where the defects that have prevented us\r\nfrom being more efficient as an Organization are to be\r\nfound, in order to redress them.\r\nI would like to reiterate some of the basic positions\r\nMexico maintains on the subject of the reform of the\r\nOrganization, while at the same time adding now some\r\ncomments regarding the proposals made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, as well as referring to some decisions which we\r\nhave taken recently.\r\nWe maintain that absolutely scrupulous respect for\r\nthe principles of law embodied in the Charter, including\r\nin the decisions the Security Council has to take on\r\nmatters affecting the peace and security of the world, is\r\na fundamental rule of conduct of countries in their\r\ninternational relations.\r\nSince 1945 Mexico has attacked the very concept of\r\na division between permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, basically because the\r\nexistence of the two categories establishes a\r\ndiscriminatory situation — a situation which is\r\nexacerbated by the permanent members having been given\r\nthe right of the veto, a privilege that has certainly been\r\nabused and has frequently prevented the Council from\r\nfulfilling its basic task.\r\nWe also maintain that the need to increase the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to prevent conflicts and\r\nresolve those that exist requires not only the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council and its working methods, but also the\r\nstrengthening of the mechanisms for resolving conflicts\r\nthrough peaceful means.\r\nWith regard to the Secretary-General’s proposals, we\r\nwelcome them and view with special interest the idea of\r\nstrengthening the Secretariat by creating a post of Deputy\r\nSecretary-General and establishing a strategic planning\r\nunit. We do not believe, however, that the objective of\r\ncutting costs should guide the reform process. Avoiding\r\nduplication and implementing the programme of the\r\nOrganization in an optimal way are the objectives that\r\nshould guide our work.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nMexico has repeatedly maintained that the financial\r\nsituation the Organization is experiencing stems from a\r\nfailure to comply with the obligations derived from the\r\nCharter. The current financial situation has no link with the\r\nassessment system. The way to deal with it is by making\r\nfull, timely and unconditional payments of the assessments\r\nthe General Assembly assigns to Member States. If we\r\nmust review the financial situation, then certainly all of us\r\nMember States are ready to do so, as long as the result is\r\nan equitable solution.\r\nThe financial crisis of the Organization should not lead\r\nus to take decisions that distort the spirit of reform we\r\nshare. Carried to the extreme, this logic would call for the\r\ndesignation of Ted Turner as a permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council, with the right of veto. By the way, we\r\nappreciate Mr. Turner’s generosity.\r\nWe view with concern some of the proposals made for\r\nmerging subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil — for example, the Commissions on Narcotic\r\nDrugs and Crime Prevention — which could in our view\r\ndevalue the treatment accorded to these subjects. The\r\nmerger of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human\r\nRights, on the other hand, would undoubtedly strengthen\r\ntreatment of the subject. Thus, while we consider that the\r\nnew tasks to be performed by the High Commissioner\r\nshould be in conformity with the provisions of the\r\ninternational instruments in force and the guidelines of the\r\ncompetent bodies in this field, we strongly support this\r\nproposal. We also welcome Mary Robinson as High\r\nCommissioner.\r\nIn relation to the reform of the Security Council, the\r\nMexican Government wishes to draw particular attention to\r\nthe following elements in the declaration adopted by the\r\nHeads of State and Government of the Rio Group on 24\r\nAugust 1997 in Asunción, Paraguay, marking the first\r\noccasion on which that forum has conducted an in-depth\r\nexchange of views on this important issue.\r\nReform of the Council is needed in order to correct\r\nthe imbalances in its current composition, improve its\r\ndecision-making mechanisms and make the conduct of its\r\nwork more transparent. A reform resulting in treatment that\r\ndiscriminates between developed and developing countries\r\nwould not be acceptable. The veto should be restricted, as\r\na first step, to Chapter VII of the Charter. The expansion,\r\nthe reform of working methods and the question of the veto\r\nform an integral part of the reform of the Security Council\r\nand should form parts of the same agreement; in other\r\nwords, we view them as an indivisible whole.\r\nLastly, the Heads of State and Government of the\r\nRio Group reiterated their readiness to continue\r\nparticipating actively in the Working Group dealing with\r\nthe subject, with a view to securing general agreement,\r\nand decided to give their Ministers for Foreign Affairs\r\n“responsibility for maintaining a broad dialogue on\r\nthe issue which takes the regional interest into\r\naccount and seeking understandings on the subject”.\r\nRepresentativeness, political legitimacy, the regional\r\napproach and consensus solutions are thus the elements\r\nthat should guide the work being undertaken.\r\nTo the extent that the above criteria are met, Mexico\r\nwants to make it clear that it is fully prepared to\r\nparticipate in an expanded, renewed and representative\r\nSecurity Council. Nevertheless, the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil must be a factor promoting cohesion and a\r\ncatalyst of cooperation among countries. At present, there\r\nare so many and such diverse formulas that we run the\r\nrisk of the issue causing divisions and tensions.\r\nClearly, the international community has not yet\r\nfound the formula for achieving consensus on this delicate\r\nmatter. The issue calls for additional consultations and\r\nbetter definitions of the very meaning of reform. States\r\ncannot conceive of Security Council reform as a source\r\nof national prestige or a way of consolidating regional\r\nhegemonies. Any reform that is adopted must be inclusive\r\nand strengthen regional equilibriums, which are\r\nsometimes very fragile and very vulnerable.\r\nToday, the States Members of the United Nations\r\nappear, for the most part, to feel threatened more than\r\nimbued with hope by the proposals that are circulating\r\nwith regard to the Security Council. A wave of lobbying\r\nand national and regional expectations has been unleashed\r\nin which the interests of the Organization itself are\r\nconspicuous by their absence. This is precisely the\r\nopposite of the spirit we want to achieve through reform.\r\nIt would be paradoxical and unacceptable if this\r\ncrucial challenge which the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil poses us were to result in a fragmenting of the\r\nUnited Nations at a time when unity of purpose and\r\ncommunity of efforts are more important than ever. The\r\nissue is too important to be dealt with hastily.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 9th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-second session 24 September 1997\r\nThe reform package proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is capable of making rapid progress, supported by\r\na broad consensus. The issue of the Security Council does\r\nnot appear to have secured the same level of agreement.\r\nLet us make progress on the first and continue to reflect\r\non the second.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
