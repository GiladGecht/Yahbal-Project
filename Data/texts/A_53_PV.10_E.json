(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 118\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/53/345/Add.2)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In a\r\nletter contained in document A/53/345/Add.2, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral informs the President of the General Assembly\r\nthat, since the issuance of his communications contained in\r\ndocuments A/53/345 and addendum 1, Togo has made the\r\nnecessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount\r\nspecified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAddress by Mr. Valdas Adamkus, President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania.\r\nMr. Valdas Adamkus, President of the Republic of\r\nLithuania, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Lithuania, His Excellency Mr. Valdas\r\nAdamkus, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Adamkus: First, let me congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of this important\r\nsession. I am certain that this session will provide us with\r\nthe opportunity to discuss the role that the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights has played during the last\r\n50 years and has yet to play.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to convey\r\nmy respects to the Secretary-General, who, by his\r\ndecisive steps in critical moments this year, has\r\nrepeatedly demonstrated the importance of the United\r\nNations in contemporary world affairs.\r\nThroughout the last 50 years the United Nations has\r\nchanged no less dynamically than the rest of the\r\nsurrounding world. Reviewing the successes and failures\r\nof the Organization, we have to acknowledge its complex\r\nand important role in building a more peaceful world. The\r\nUnited Nations at present is living through a complicated\r\nperiod of internal reform designed to reinforce the values\r\nand principles which half a century ago encouraged the\r\nStates of the world to sign the Charter establishing the\r\nUnited Nations, which guides us today into the twenty-\r\nfirst century. I speak of peace, democracy and the\r\nenvironment and of ensuring and promoting the\r\ndevelopment of freedom of the individual.\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nadoption by the General Assembly of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This crucial instrument\r\ndeclares the will of the people of the world to establish a\r\nuniversal understanding of individual freedom, equality and\r\ndignity, which are indivisible and must not be undermined.\r\nToday we should be particularly concerned to what extent\r\nthe principles declared by the United Nations throughout\r\nthe last 50 years have become the bedrock of our everyday\r\nlife. It would be most appropriate to ask whether the United\r\nNations has become an Organization of world nations rather\r\nthan States.\r\nIn the contemporary world of advanced\r\ncommunications, the exchange of values and ideas takes\r\nplace at a particularly high speed. It is therefore not\r\nsurprising that freedom, justice and well-being carry the\r\nsame meaning in Europe and Asia, Africa and America. I\r\nbelieve we are approaching a common denominator for\r\ndemocracy so that democracy will no longer be identified\r\nonly with the West and rapid economic development only\r\nwith certain regions of the world. Above all, we hope that\r\nthe realization of human rights throughout the world is\r\nconsistent with the spirit of the Declaration of Human\r\nRights signed 50 years ago.\r\nIn the cold-war world of divided ideologies, the\r\nUnited Nations was one of the very few forums embodying\r\nthe common human interest: the concern for peace. Today\r\nthe United Nations can contribute considerably to the\r\ncreation and education of free individuals and active\r\ncitizens of the world.\r\nHistory has proved that democratic and prosperous\r\nStates provide the most favourable environment for human\r\nactivities. The United Nations should therefore continue its\r\nefforts to promote democratization and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The ongoing institutional reform of the\r\nOrganization may serve this end. However, I should like\r\nalso to underscore the need to pay even greater attention to\r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights.\r\nWillingly and freely we have empowered the Security\r\nCouncil to make binding decisions to which we are then\r\ncommitted. We therefore want the decisions to be of high\r\nquality, effective and acceptable. Two highly qualified\r\nindustrialized countries could become permanent members\r\nof the Security Council; their membership would strengthen\r\nthe Council and ensure democratic decisions. A broader\r\nrepresentation of developing nations on the Council would\r\nalso reinforce its legitimacy and enhance respect for it.\r\nThese nations deserve additional seats, both permanent and\r\nnon-permanent. Equitable representation in the Council\r\nshould be expanded through a more just representation of\r\nregions, Central and Eastern Europe in particular.\r\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights, Mary Robinson, has noted that today’s human\r\nrights violations are the causes of tomorrow’s conflicts.\r\nWar-ravaged Bosnia and conflict-inflamed Kosovo today\r\nare painful illustrations of these words. Lithuania\r\nwelcomes the initiative of Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nto integrate human rights protection into the broad range\r\nof the Organization’s activities. We likewise welcome the\r\nongoing institutional reforms of human rights protection\r\nand propose to employ with greater effectiveness the\r\nexperience and intellectual potential of such regional\r\nbodies as the Council of Europe and the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nOne of the most laudable recent achievements of the\r\nworld’s nations is the adoption of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. By taking this decision, the\r\ninternational community demonstrated its readiness for a\r\nqualitative leap in international relations based on an\r\neffective system of international justice — an instrument\r\ndesigned to complement national legal systems and to\r\nencourage their continuous development.\r\nIt is gratifying that the Court has been granted the\r\nright to charge persons with criminal responsibility for the\r\ngravest crimes of all: genocide, war crimes and crimes\r\nagainst humanity. This step demonstrates our resolution\r\nto fight against the horrors for which there are no — and\r\ncannot be any — political or ideological boundaries.\r\n“Crime of aggression” in the Statute is a pending issue\r\nrequiring the political will of States and a more precise\r\nlegal definition. The bitter facts of modern history remind\r\nus that aggression too often leads to genocide, war crimes\r\nand crimes against humanity.\r\nI would like to note that Lithuania, which actively\r\nparticipated in the work of the Preparatory Committee and\r\nthe Rome Conference, will in the near future sign the\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court.\r\nToday we all face the challenges of our\r\ncontemporary world which have been caused by rapidly\r\ndeveloping technologies and negligent human activities.\r\nThese challenges, although not as evident as open military\r\nconflicts, are no less threatening. A devastated and\r\ndeteriorating environment may cause conflicts on a scale\r\nunknown before. The struggle for fresh water, rich soil\r\nand natural resources can turn man against man and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nnation against nation. Neither democratic political processes\r\nnor economic development will matter then.\r\nAs a man with a long-standing commitment to\r\nenvironmental protection, I invite you to make use of the\r\ninternational capabilities of the United Nations and to pay\r\nmore attention to ecological issues. If we are genuine in our\r\nattempt to place this institution at the vanguard of human\r\nrights protection, environmental issues should be given\r\npriority on our agenda. Lithuania will support every\r\ninitiative to preserve and conserve natural resources. As one\r\nsuch step, I yesterday signed the Kyoto Protocol,\r\nreaffirming our commitment to tackling global warming by\r\nreducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Now we look\r\nforward to decisive action on climate change in Buenos\r\nAires later this year.\r\nEvery individual has the incontestable right to live in\r\na healthy and clean environment. I am certain that the\r\nUnited Nations can play a significant role in promoting\r\nrespect for the environment among people and States of the\r\nworld. With its long experience in international cooperation\r\nand its prominent international standing, this Organization\r\ncan contribute notably to the environmental education of the\r\nglobal community. It can also serve as a promoter of inter-\r\nState cooperation through the timely exchange of\r\ninformation on disasters — past, present and future. The\r\nPrior Informed Consent (PIC) Convention on trade in\r\nhazardous chemicals and pesticides, which was signed in\r\nRotterdam a couple of days ago, is a remarkable example\r\nof prospective activities of the United Nations system.\r\nThe growing problems of international crime and\r\nterrorism affecting us are no less important than\r\nenvironmental issues. Terrorist bombings and illicit\r\ntrafficking in arms, narcotic substances and human beings,\r\nas well as money laundering, infringe the vital interests of\r\npeople and States to live in a secure and predictable world.\r\nThe solution to these problems demands collective efforts\r\nas well as resolute and immediate action. It is gratifying\r\nthat the heads of State and Government, as well as interior\r\nministers, confirmed their commitment to constructive\r\ncooperation at the twentieth special session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly, on drugs. The approved drug-\r\ndemand reduction and prevention programme, along with\r\nthe guidelines for international cooperation, should facilitate\r\nthe resolution of these problems.\r\nChildren and young people — our future — should be\r\nthe focus of the fight against drug-trafficking. Timely\r\nadoption and launching of preventive measures and\r\neducational programmes, as well as the building of a drug-\r\nfree environment, must be our immediate first steps. It is\r\ndelightful that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has shown\r\nparticular attention to this problem.\r\nControl of the arms trade, which is becoming\r\nincreasingly complex, is another painful reality facing us\r\nat the end of this century. Smugglers arm not only\r\nterrorists, but also nations or States at war. Without any\r\nfurther delay we should forestall illicit arms circulation\r\nby, first and foremost, restricting the sale of small arms\r\nand light weapons in conflict zones. We should persist in\r\nour efforts to find an effective solution to the issue of\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament.\r\nThe nuclear arms race, which emerged in South Asia\r\nthis year, has revealed the survival of the cold war\r\nideology of the balance of powers in the political thinking\r\nof certain States. Such reasoning is short on\r\nconstructiveness since it does not enhance international\r\nsecurity, and it diverts human resources and creative\r\npowers into erroneous directions, undermining the\r\naspirations of the individual to a safer and wealthier life.\r\nLithuania is neither a zone of potential conflict nor\r\na place for the manufacturing or circulation of\r\nconventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction.\r\nNevertheless, Lithuania endeavours to participate actively\r\nin different agreements on disarmament and arms control\r\nthrough which it helps itself and others. My country has\r\nratified the conventions prohibiting biological, chemical\r\nand certain conventional weapons. Ratification of the\r\nconvention prohibiting anti-personnel mines is our long-\r\nterm goal.\r\nIt is my belief that the right of the individual to a\r\nsecure life and future — a right still missing from the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights — fully\r\ncorresponds to the spirit of the Declaration and should be\r\nrealized through our political initiatives. The security of\r\nthe individual will be best ensured if the State he lives in\r\nis secure. Good neighbourly relations and close regional\r\ncooperation are prerequisites for the peaceful coexistence\r\nof nations, and all humankind aspires to this. Lithuania is\r\nguided by those principles and maintains friendly,\r\nconstructive relations with all its neighbours, Russia\r\namong them.\r\nThe United Nations today acts not only in a multi-\r\npolar but also multi-problem environment. By itself it is\r\nnot capable of addressing and resolving all the problems\r\nwhich we often tend to call “hot” issues and which\r\ndemand immediate solutions. Therefore, the Organization\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nshould interact with greater vigour in its endeavours with\r\nregional organizations that, in many cases, succeed in the\r\nareas where global forums fail. Europe has already provided\r\nus with an example of such productive interaction through\r\nconcrete cooperation of the United Nations with the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\r\nEurope, however, has other, smaller organizations\r\nwhich can also considerably contribute to the goals of the\r\nUnited Nations and to the implementation of their spirit.\r\nThe Council of the Baltic Sea States, of which Lithuania\r\nhas recently assumed the chairmanship, is one of them.\r\nThis Council unites geographical neighbours who also enjoy\r\nmany, more binding links: the promotion of mutual\r\nconfidence, trade, culture and environmental protection.\r\nDuring the term of its chairmanship, Lithuania will strive\r\nfor a more active and effective contribution of this regional\r\ncooperation body to the implementation of the goals of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights is a reminder of the indivisibility of the\r\nvalues of human life, dignity and welfare. Political activities\r\nat both the international and national levels should be\r\ndirected to promoting and protecting these values. More and\r\nmore threats to human rights and freedoms arise today from\r\nsources beyond the control of national Governments. Never\r\nbefore have the issues of coordination and enhanced\r\ncooperation been as crucial as they are today. The United\r\nNations possesses all the potential necessary to perform the\r\nrole of active international coordinator and peace promoter.\r\nBut the realization of this potential requires determination\r\nfrom us, the representatives of nations and members of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Valdas Adamkus, President of the Republic of\r\nLithuania, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Janet Jagan, President of the Republic\r\nof Guyana\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Guyana.\r\nMrs. Janet Jagan, President of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Guyana, Her Excellency Mrs. Janet Jagan,\r\nand to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Jagan: In just 15 months, our world will\r\nenter a new millennium, leaving behind it a chequered\r\npast to face the challenges of a yet uncharted future. It is\r\nnot too early to contemplate this historic conjuncture and\r\nto give some thought to how best we may deal with the\r\nuncertainties ahead.\r\nThis fifty-third session of the General Assembly\r\noffers, we believe, a timely opportunity for such\r\nreflection. Your leadership, Mr. President, will be\r\nessential to the success of our exploration. We are assured\r\nthat your diplomatic experience and skills, demonstrated\r\nin the service of your native Uruguay, will contribute\r\ngreatly to the success of our deliberations.\r\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of the\r\nUkraine, we offer our sincere appreciation and thanks for\r\nthe admirable guidance which he provided the Assembly\r\nover the past year.\r\nOur gratitude is extended to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the inspired direction which he has\r\ngiven to our Organization. From the report that he has\r\nbeen good enough to present us on the activities of the\r\nlast 12 months, we are able to see clearly those areas\r\nwhere our stated goals have been reached and, equally\r\nimportantly, those which require our further attention and\r\neffort.\r\nCertainly, among the developments that are most\r\nheartening is the spread of democracy within recent times.\r\nIt is a happy coincidence that this year we celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights,\r\nwhich embodies the principles of democracy. The\r\ndemocratic system has emerged as a popular form of\r\ngovernment for many States Members of the United\r\nNations. Guyana has rejoined this growing majority.\r\nUnfortunately, this had to come after hard struggles and\r\nour people experienced three decades of lost opportunities\r\nunder an undemocratic regime. Only last December, for\r\nthe second time this decade, elections were held under\r\ninternational scrutiny, leading to the re-election of my\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nGovernment to office. However, despite the fact that the\r\noutcome was adjudged by international observers to be free\r\nand fair, the minority opposition refuses to abide by the\r\nresult. Consequently, the will of the electorate has been\r\nquestioned. Unfortunately, this negation of elections\r\nconducted in a free and fair manner is not limited to\r\nGuyana and increasingly requires our attention. Naturally,\r\nmy Government cannot tolerate this state of affairs, nor\r\nshould the United Nations, which by its Charter is called\r\nupon to protect the gains of new and restored democracies.\r\nIt is vital that the international community and the\r\nUnited Nations rally in support of our efforts to achieve\r\nbetter governance and to guarantee the enjoyment of all\r\nhuman rights by our citizens. We need to go beyond the\r\nholding of periodic elections to ensuring the observance of\r\nthe rule of law and building the institutions upon which\r\ndemocracy must rest.\r\nRegrettably, many of our democracies are severely\r\nlimited, in terms of their own resources, in their ability to\r\nsatisfy these pressing needs. As a result, hard-won gains are\r\nunder constant threat of erosion. We firmly believe that it\r\nis in the interest of the international community as a whole\r\nto assist in the strengthening of the democratic system as a\r\nbulwark against encroachment by oppressive regimes. Only\r\nthrough such cooperation can the democratic ideal take root\r\nand flourish throughout the world. On our part, we will\r\nstaunchly defend the gains of our people and we are\r\nresolved not to allow ourselves to slide once again into the\r\ndarkness of dictatorship.\r\nNeedless to say, the spread of democracy within States\r\nmust be matched by democracy among States. The United\r\nNations was founded in 1945 on the premise of the\r\nsovereign equality of all States. This principle is the rock\r\nupon which international cooperation among peoples has\r\nbeen built. In their operation, therefore, all organs and\r\nagencies within the international system must be cognizant\r\nof the views and wishes of all States. Developing countries\r\nin particular need to be adequately represented in these\r\nbodies to ensure that their concerns are addressed.\r\nIn this scheme of things, we attach great importance\r\nto reaching general agreement on how the Security Council\r\nmust be transformed into an organ that enjoys the\r\nconfidence and support of all States. Clearly, the body\r\nwhich was created in the aftermath of the Second World\r\nWar is no longer appropriate to the circumstances of\r\ntoday’s world. Sorely needed now is a more representative\r\nand transparent Council that can adequately address new\r\nthreats to international peace and security. Accordingly, we\r\nencourage the Working Group that was created to reform\r\nthe Council to persist in its search for a suitably reformed\r\nCouncil.\r\nOur task is made especially urgent by the realization\r\nthat, despite our perseverance, the achievement of\r\ninternational peace and security remains a frustrating will-\r\no’-the-wisp. There are today more peacekeeping\r\noperations than the international community appears able\r\nor willing to sustain. Some have been reasonably\r\nsuccessful, and, others appear to promise eventual\r\nsettlement. Most, however, seem to be ending with little\r\nto show for the considerable investment of time and\r\nmoney.\r\nOne can only conclude from these varying results\r\nthat increasingly we will have to turn to preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-building to fully\r\naddress and treat the root causes of tension.\r\nWe are also constantly reminded that,\r\nnotwithstanding the abatement in East-West tensions, the\r\ndangers of a nuclear catastrophe are still very real and\r\npresent. It is impossible to guarantee, in an unstable world\r\nsuch as ours, that nuclear weapons will not be used, either\r\nintentionally or inadvertently. Only a complete prohibition\r\nof such weapons, binding upon all States, can reduce the\r\nrisk of nuclear disaster. My Government therefore urges\r\nthe international community to move swiftly to a total\r\nelimination of these weapons coupled with an undertaking\r\nto discontinue their production.\r\nAt the same time, we must redouble our efforts to\r\ncurb the flow of conventional weapons, which serves to\r\nfuel conflagrations in trouble spots throughout the world.\r\nWe must also intensify our search for a collective system\r\nof security upon which all States can rely for protection.\r\nPeace, as has been so aptly said, is not the mere\r\nabsence of war. True peace can only come if it is built on\r\na foundation of sound economic and social development.\r\nThe foremost obstacle to peace is poverty, which, when\r\nit can be borne no longer, explodes with a vengeance. It\r\nis imperative, therefore, that the problem of poverty be\r\nsquarely addressed by the United Nations with a view to\r\nhalving its incidence by the year 2015. Reaching this\r\ntarget will require concerted action by both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries. The developed countries have a\r\nvested interest in the economic prosperity of developing\r\ncountries, since they represent important markets for their\r\nexports. A renewal of the dialogue between the industrial\r\nand the developing nations is urgently needed to achieve\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nthe eradication of poverty. My Government intends to make\r\nthis a primary goal during this year’s session of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nNotwithstanding the onerous debt obligations and a\r\nphysical infrastructure which we are tackling as a priority,\r\nGuyana has come a long way in overcoming poverty and\r\nmaximizing its full growth potential. Thus, we continue to\r\nrely heavily on external assistance for our economic\r\ndevelopment. We are therefore particularly concerned by\r\nthe rapid diminution of resources made available for\r\nfinancing by both bilateral donors and multilateral agencies.\r\nWhile private investment flows have a role to play in the\r\ndevelopment process, they are still far too selective to be of\r\nbenefit to weak economies. We need to be assured of the\r\ncontinued provision of official development assistance,\r\nsufficient investment flows, technological transfer and trade\r\nopportunities that would allow for adequate development.\r\nAs we move into the next century, we have to\r\nrecognize the reality that developing countries are extremely\r\nvulnerable to changes in the world economy. The present\r\ncourse of globalization and liberalization has led to\r\nmarginalization of the poorer countries. Guyana is a case in\r\npoint. We have returned to the democratic fold and have\r\nachieved fairly high growth rates despite structural\r\nadjustment programmes. But after a few years, we are now\r\nfaced with a steep drop in prices of our main export\r\ncommodities, the drying up of developmental aid, adverse\r\nglobal weather conditions and so forth. At the end of the\r\nday, our people face tremendous hardships.\r\nWe are being told that growing investment is needed.\r\nWe open our economies to work with the private sector for\r\ndevelopment, and we see investment being directed away\r\nfrom the poorer countries, making them incapable of\r\nmodernizing their economies. There is a need for a global\r\nconsensus to assist developing countries to complete their\r\ntransition so that they can be equal players in the\r\nglobalization process.\r\nThe alternative is to continue to ignore the danger\r\nsignals which are becoming more and more evident. And,\r\nas usual, the rich countries will be able to solve their\r\nproblems, but will do so at the expense of the poorer\r\ncountries. The gap between the poor and rich will become\r\ngreater, and conflicts will continue. The narcotics trade,\r\nmass migration, international crime, poverty and other ills\r\nwill put severe strains on new and restored democracies.\r\nAs we have become painfully aware, threats to our\r\nenvironment also impinge on our peace and security. Global\r\nwarming and climate changes have increased the\r\nvulnerability of small States such as Guyana to a wave of\r\nnatural disasters. The El Niño phenomenon recently\r\ninflicted on our country a period of intense drought,\r\ntaking a heavy toll on our economy.\r\nIn our continuing efforts to develop our country and\r\nmeet the needs of our people, especially those living in\r\npoverty, my country remains dedicated to the preservation\r\nof the environment and the sustainable development of\r\nour resources. We are concerned, therefore, that when we\r\nseek to exploit our forest and other resources for the\r\nbenefit of our people, we face criticisms from those who\r\naccuse us of disregard for the environment.\r\nThese reproaches are entirely ill-informed, if not\r\nmischievous. A land of abundant and pristine forests,\r\nGuyana runs no risk of deforestation. We have in fact put\r\nin place firm legislative and administrative arrangements\r\nto ensure the conservation of our natural resources.\r\nMoreover, under the Iwokrama rain forest project, we\r\nhave set aside almost a million acres of these forests for\r\nresearch by the international community into the\r\npreservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of the\r\nforests.\r\nThe four pillars which I have listed — democracy,\r\neconomic and social development, human rights and the\r\nelimination of poverty — are indispensable to the\r\nconstruction of peace. Events in the post-war period have\r\nnot only confirmed this fact, but have also shown that the\r\nbuilding of peace and development must be the work of\r\nthe international community. Persuaded of the need for\r\nenhanced multilateralism, my Government is committed\r\nto the realization of the late President Cheddi Jagan’s\r\nvision of a new global human order. The thrust of his\r\nproposal sought to reduce the ever widening and\r\ndangerous gap which exists between countries in the\r\nNorth and those in the South.\r\nRecalling the Marshall Plan, which served to rebuild\r\nEurope from the ashes of the Second World War,\r\nMr. Jagan argued for a similar enterprise to eradicate\r\npoverty, promote good governance and bring development\r\nto all peoples. Only through such enlightened cooperation\r\ncan the world enjoy the blessings of peace. I wish,\r\ntherefore, to renew his plea and to call for early\r\nagreement on the establishment of a more just and\r\nequitable system of international relations. With the\r\nnecessary determination and effort, we can make the\r\ntwenty-first century a golden age for all humanity.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guyana for the statement she\r\nhas just made.\r\nMrs. Janet Jagan, President of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Raúl Cubas Grau, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Raúl Cubas Grau, President of the Republic of\r\nParaguay, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I have\r\nthe honour to welcome to the United Nations, the President\r\nof the Republic of Paraguay, His Excellency Mr. Raúl\r\nCubas Grau, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Cubas Grau (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIt is with great pleasure that I speak today, before this\r\nesteemed forum for international dialogue, on behalf of my\r\ncountry, the Republic of Paraguay. First of all, I would like\r\nto congratulate the President of the General Assembly and\r\nto extend to him my best wishes for success in the\r\nimportant task of guiding the work of the fifty-third session\r\nof the General Assembly of this Organization.\r\nI also have the pleasure to greet the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, and to extend to him, on behalf of the\r\npeople of Paraguay, our congratulations on his excellent\r\nfulfilment of his important mission.\r\nAs the century comes to an end, so does a decade that\r\nhas been for the world, and particularly for nations such as\r\nmine, a period of far-reaching and vertiginous\r\ntransformation.\r\nIn 1989, after almost four decades of authoritarian\r\nrule, Paraguay regained its democracy. Since that time, a\r\ngreat number of profound and dramatic changes have taken\r\nplace in the process of reaffirming our democracy, a\r\nprocess that today, I am pleased to announce, may now be\r\nconsidered definitively consolidated, since for the first time\r\nin 50 years a civilian President has transferred the\r\npresidency of the Republic to another democratically\r\nelected civilian. This is an essential milestone in the\r\nrecent history of our freedom and a striking testimony to\r\nthe Paraguayan people’s firm and irreversible commitment\r\nto this system of government.\r\nWe took over the administration of a country with\r\nmajor economic, social and moral problems, but, faithful\r\nto the people’s mandate, we will make the decisions that\r\nwe deem appropriate and fitting to reactivate our\r\neconomy, restore international confidence in Paraguay\r\nand, finally, ensure the sustainable and equitable\r\ndevelopment of its people.\r\nThis, today, is my commitment, and I will dedicate\r\nall my devotion and labour to it, though I am aware that\r\nthis effort would be in vain without the understanding,\r\nsolidarity and support of my people, as well as the\r\ninvolvement and cooperation of friendly countries.\r\nIn this regard, my Government has pledged to carry\r\nout a State agenda that is pragmatic and realistic. Its\r\npriorities will include restoration of the people’s faith in\r\ntheir leaders through transparent, coordinated actions\r\nwhose immediate effects will, in the short term, result in\r\ngreater well-being for the population. We will also carry\r\nout an all-out war against poverty by doing away with the\r\nprivileges that engender injustices and intolerable\r\ninequalities.\r\nAnother priority will be a rapid economic recovery\r\nthrough the implementation of social programmes and the\r\nconstruction of an infrastructure of all-weather roads,\r\nwhich will expedite and reduce the cost of the rapid\r\ntransport of goods produced in rural areas to trade\r\ncentres. We will also initiate programmes to provide\r\ninexpensive housing for a large sector of the population.\r\nWe will give priority to the fight against crime in all\r\nits forms, focusing on the elimination of the scourges of\r\ndrug-trafficking and the piracy and illegal appropriation\r\nof intellectual property. The concrete actions we have\r\ntaken during our first month in office have clearly shown\r\nour firmness, determination and commitment in this\r\nregard.\r\nAnother priority will be combating impunity, one of\r\nthe ills that eats away at our society. We will be\r\nassiduous in the rigorous application of the law, which is\r\nthe inevitable framework for ensuring confidence and\r\ndevelopment, particularly against those who profit from\r\nState resources, depriving the rest of the community of\r\ntheir legitimate chance to aspire to a better standard of\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nliving. Exemplary measures will be adopted to address\r\npremeditated crimes in the economic and financial sphere.\r\nWe trust that these measures, along with those for the\r\nprotection of private property and an adequate framework\r\nof incentives and security for foreign investment, will assist\r\nus in recovering Paraguay’s international credibility and\r\nwill bring in the flow of cooperation and investment\r\nnecessary for our desired development.\r\nThe reform of the principal organs of the United\r\nNations — the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil — is of the greatest importance to us.\r\nWe have participated in the work of the Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform, and once again I wish\r\nto emphasize the importance we attach to the expansion of\r\nthe Council in both of its categories; if the number of\r\npermanent members is increased, the number of non-\r\npermanent members must be increased as well.\r\nThis increase must include Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean and the other regional groups, without any\r\ndiscrimination.\r\nWe believe that the effort undertaken by the United\r\nNations with regard to item 155 on the Assembly’s\r\nagenda — “Measures to eliminate international\r\nterrorism” — is of the greatest relevance.\r\nParaguay vehemently condemns and rejects such acts\r\nof international terrorism as the attacks on the American\r\nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\r\nIn this respect, we wish to express our conviction that\r\nany international action to prevent and subdue terrorism\r\nmust be carried out in full and complete compliance with\r\ninternational law.\r\nAnother scourge, generally related to terrorism, is that\r\nof drug-trafficking, to which I have already referred. In this\r\ncontext, I must add that we are convinced that this is a\r\nproblem of shared responsibilities among all countries\r\ninvolved, producing, transit and consuming countries. Our\r\nposition on this point was clearly stated in the Declaration\r\nof the Twelfth Meeting of Heads of State and Government\r\nof the Rio Group, held in Panama City.\r\nWe welcome initiatives such as resolution 49/96, on\r\nhorizontal economic cooperation and other modalities for\r\ncooperation among developing countries. We must also\r\nmention last year’s Declaration and Plan of Action of San\r\nJosé, Costa Rica, which defines specific modalities for\r\ndealing with sectoral problems relating to cooperation in\r\nthe spheres of trade, investment, finance and business.\r\nHowever, we feel that the United Nations system\r\nshould identify mechanisms, such as economic and\r\ntechnical cooperation, that will enable it to strengthen\r\nintegration more effectively, and adopt decisions aimed at\r\nproviding increased assistance. In this regard, my country\r\nwill support such measures as will, in a more effective\r\nand coordinated manner, interest all participants —\r\nparticularly private-sector participants — in the\r\ndevelopment process.\r\nWe also endorse strengthening the United Nations to\r\nincrease efficiency within the institutions of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIf our Government programmes focus on supporting\r\ndevelopment with social justice we can give our peoples\r\ndemocracy, freedom and respect for human rights.\r\nHowever, we cannot ask our peoples to fight for\r\ndevelopment, to make greater sacrifices, if they do not see\r\nsimilar trends towards change and a unified commitment\r\non the part of the international community.\r\nComplying with our commitments made at the\r\nSummit for Social Development, Paraguay intends to\r\nachieve the goals set there. In this regard, I am pleased to\r\nstate that the priorities of our Administration include the\r\nsocial development of the country; reduction of the\r\nunemployment rate; the eradication of poverty;\r\npreservation of the environment — a commitment to our\r\nfuture generations; heeding the demands of our youth; and\r\nsupporting the advancement of women and of integrated\r\nsocieties.\r\nBased on the fundamental principle of universality,\r\nthe Republic of Paraguay feels that the United Nations\r\nsystem must welcome, without exception, all States that\r\nmeet the requirements of the San Francisco Charter.\r\nGiven this, and bearing in mind the elements that make\r\nup a State as well as other essential considerations,\r\nParaguay feels that the proposed participation of the\r\nRepublic of China in the United Nations and all its\r\nrelated bodies must be considered. This is what we would\r\ndo with any other State that met the requirements of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMr. Montealegre Rivas (Nicaragua), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nI would now like to refer to one of the most important\r\nstrategies for the socio-economic development of my\r\ncountry: its participation in the Southern Cone Common\r\nMarket (MERCOSUR), which is a fundamental objective of\r\nour foreign policy. The achievements of MERCOSUR,\r\nwhich was created in 1991 through the Treaty of Asunción,\r\nas part of the process of integration, are a matter of pride\r\nfor our four countries — Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and\r\nParaguay — as well as for Bolivia and Chile. These\r\nachievements have encouraged us to renew our efforts,\r\ncertain that the political will that has guided us so far will\r\nlead us to achieve the goals that we have set for ourselves:\r\nto strengthen and consolidate the Customs Union and to\r\nmove towards a greater level of integration.\r\nMoreover, it is encouraging to note that the path we\r\nchose in 1991 has attracted more and more interest from an\r\nincreasingly globalized world. In this regard, MERCOSUR\r\nhas shown its openness to dialogue, in particular with the\r\nsister countries of Latin America. We are not a closed\r\ncommunity, but, rather, are open to initiatives that will\r\npromote economic, political and social cooperation. In this\r\nspirit, we are giving particular attention to the negotiations\r\ninitiated to establish a free-trade zone for the hemisphere\r\nand to the negotiations we intend to hold in the near future\r\nwith the European Union.\r\nThe recent crisis in financial markets in South-East\r\nAsia and Eastern Europe, which have in turn threatened the\r\nstability of the financial markets of emerging economies,\r\nare a disturbing feature of today’s international scene. It\r\nwas mentioned in the Declaration of the Twelfth Summit of\r\nthe Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group, held\r\nin Panama City, in which the position of the signatory\r\ncountries is clearly expressed.\r\nA great deal of hope has been placed in the work\r\ncarried out by this Organization. We are on the threshold of\r\na new millennium; the twenty-first century looms on the\r\nhorizon, rich with opportunities and challenges. Our\r\nsocieties are suffering from the crisis of the birth of a new\r\nera, a new order, because we are not all yet adequately\r\nprepared to confront it.\r\nTherefore, our societies demand leadership from the\r\nUnited Nations. The conclusions, recommendations and\r\nactions that may come from this Assembly could be of\r\nfundamental importance for our immediate future.\r\nThe problems emerging from the increase in\r\nglobalization and interdependence, as well as the dizzying\r\nspeed with which changes are taking place in the world,\r\naffecting all aspects of the human condition, force us\r\ninexorably to confront the challenge of finding the most\r\nideal mechanisms for dialogue, understanding and\r\neffective and united international cooperation. We trust\r\nthat the United Nations will be capable of meeting this\r\nchallenge.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Raúl Cubas Grau, President of the Republic of\r\nParaguay, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Isack Mudenge,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Mudenge (Zimbabwe): At the outset I would\r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his unanimous\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. His election is a well-deserved tribute\r\nto his own admirable diplomatic skills and also a vote of\r\nconfidence in his country, Uruguay. My delegation\r\nintends to cooperate fully with him as he guides the work\r\nof this Assembly.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express our\r\nsincere appreciation to his predecessor, our friend\r\nHennadiy Udovenko, of the Republic of Ukraine, for the\r\nable and exemplary manner in which he presided over the\r\nwork of the fifty-second session.\r\nIn the same vein, we would like to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose style of work\r\nand vigorous response to the various crises that have\r\nbeset the international community we deeply appreciate.\r\nWe want to reiterate our confidence in his work and\r\ncontinued support for his leadership.\r\nFollowing the United Nations fiftieth anniversary\r\ncelebrations, we, the Member States, reaffirmed our\r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the\r\nOrganization as enshrined in the Charter and further took\r\non the responsibility of charting an institutional\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nframework and operational parameters that would enhance\r\nthe Organization’s relevance and effectiveness in the\r\ntwenty-first century. The reform proposals made by the\r\nSecretary-General in 1997 attempted to articulate a vision\r\nof the future for a United Nations Organization that is more\r\nfocused and coherent and one that better reflects the new\r\ngeopolitical realities of the post-cold-war era.\r\nWe are encouraged that the first phase of the reform\r\nof the United Nations system was launched when the\r\nSecretary-General began to implement those measures that\r\nfall within his sphere of competence as chief administrative\r\nofficer of our Organization. My Government has taken full\r\ncognizance of those measures, as well as of proposals for\r\nreform, and is carefully considering them in detail.\r\nThe proposal to convene a Millennium Assembly to\r\narticulate a vision for the United Nations in the new century\r\nhas our full support. All Member States must actively\r\nparticipate in the preparations for and holding of the\r\nMillennium Assembly in order to come up with a\r\nconsensus document to guide the Organization into the next\r\ncentury. However, we believe that the proposed sunset\r\nprovisions, which are to effect cut-off mechanisms for some\r\nissues on the United Nations agenda, need to be carefully\r\nconsidered. My Government will lend its support to any\r\ndevelopment dividend that channels savings generated by\r\nadministrative efficiency into a Development Account,\r\nespecially if it benefits developing countries. We must\r\ncontinue to search for a general agreement on the proper\r\nand efficient utilization of the Development Account.\r\nWhen the reform process was first initiated, my\r\nGovernment alluded to the need for us, the Member States,\r\nto formulate a mechanism to deal with the financial crisis,\r\nwhich, much to our chagrin, continues to worsen. I reiterate\r\nonce again that it is we, the Member States, who have to\r\npay our dues promptly, in full and unconditionally or risk\r\nbeing an ineffective Organization that is incapable of\r\nmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nStill on the process of reform, my Government is\r\ndisappointed by the excruciatingly slow progress being\r\nmade in the Open-ended Working Group on the Question\r\nof Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council. The key issue of the\r\nexpansion still preoccupies the Working Group and a\r\nsolution continues to elude that Group. Africa, for its part,\r\nremains steadfast in its just demand for two permanent\r\nseats — to be shared on a rotational basis — as well as for\r\nthree non-permanent seats. The system of rotation is an\r\ninnovation that Africa is proposing in the name of\r\ndemocracy and sovereign equality of Member States. It\r\nmay not suit other regions, and we have stated that we\r\nare preparing it for the Africa region alone. I take this\r\nopportunity once more to urge our friends outside the\r\nAfrica region to support our just demand, as it is intended\r\nto enhance the representative nature and authority of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIt has also become apparent that the impasse in the\r\ndeliberations of the Working Group is a result of the\r\nnonacceptance by a handful of powerful countries of the\r\nsacrosanct principles of equitable representation,\r\ndemocracy and transparency. We hold that the\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations system is integral\r\nto its continued legitimacy and efficacy. Conversely, the\r\nincreasing inefficiencies and lack of efficacy that we\r\nwitness today on the part of the Security Council are in\r\nlarge measure the consequence of its lack of moral\r\nauthority, itself the result of the unrepresentative and\r\nundemocratic nature of the Council as it is presently\r\nconstituted.\r\nIn the name of human rights, pressure has been\r\nbrought to bear especially on developing countries to\r\ndemocratize their national political systems and to become\r\nmore transparent, and most of them have done so. We\r\ntherefore insist that the same processes of democratization\r\nand transparency should characterize international\r\nrelations, particularly the reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nLet me recall that the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries has on several occasions spoken against the\r\nanachronistic and undemocratic nature of the power of the\r\nveto. The Movement has proposed the restriction of the\r\nscope of the veto to matters pertaining to Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter, with a view to its eventual abolition. But\r\nwhile the veto exists we insist that all new permanent\r\nmembers should, in accordance with the principle of\r\nsovereign equality of Member States, equally wield the\r\npower of the veto.\r\nAfrica has witnessed a dramatic broadening of\r\nrelative peace and stability with the return of democracy\r\nto Liberia and Sierra Leone. The return of the legitimate\r\nGovernment of Sierra Leone is of particular significance\r\nto the African continent, as it came about as a result of\r\nresolute action by the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States to reverse the military coup in that country.\r\nThis was in conformity with an Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) watershed resolution taken at the Harare\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nsummit in 1997 in response to the coup in Sierra Leone to\r\nthe effect that henceforth Africa will not accept the change\r\nof a legitimate Government on the continent by military\r\nmeans.\r\nAnother example of the positive political developments\r\nin Africa has been the various steps taken by the present\r\nGovernment of Nigeria to return that key country to\r\ndemocratic governance. It is only fair that those who have\r\nbeen critical of events in that country in the past should\r\nnow openly welcome the recent positive developments.\r\nBut the situation in Africa has not been without its\r\ndisappointments. The deteriorating situation in Angola\r\ndeserves our urgent attention. The achievement of peace\r\nand stability in that country continues to be obstructed by\r\nUNITA’s constant and deliberate non-compliance with the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol or with relevant\r\nresolutions of the United Nations Security Council. We\r\nurge the UNITA leadership to heed to the voice of reason\r\nand give peace a chance in Angola. We equally urge those\r\nmembers of the international community who have\r\ninfluence on the UNITA leader to persuade him. In the\r\nmeantime, we ask the international community to join\r\nAngola and the countries of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) in their decision to work\r\nwith those positive elements in UNITA who have\r\ncommitted themselves to continue with the peace process in\r\nAngola.\r\nSovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of\r\nStates are age-old principles of international law, and\r\nrespect for them is the bedrock of inter-State relations.\r\nThese fundamental principles are at the core of the United\r\nNations Charter, to which we all subscribe. They are held\r\nequally sacrosanct in the Non-Aligned Movement, the OAU\r\nand many other international organizations. Therefore any\r\nviolation of these principles cannot and must not be taken\r\nlightly, as it poses a serious threat to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nSadly, in our subregion, the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo has recently fallen victim to such flagrant\r\nviolations of international law. In August this year, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo found itself under siege\r\nby rebels supported by foreign troops. Realizing that the\r\nfall of Kinshasa was imminent, the legitimate Government\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in accordance\r\nwith Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, appealed for\r\nassistance from Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) member States to enable it to defend its\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nThe presence in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo of allied forces from the SADC States of Angola,\r\nNamibia and Zimbabwe is a response to this call and has\r\nthe objective of upholding the fundamental provisions of\r\nthe Charters of the United Nations and of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on the inviolability\r\nof the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence\r\nof member States. It is also in line with the OAU\r\nresolution approved at the Harare summit of 1997\r\ncondemning the change of legitimate Governments by\r\nmilitary means, as well as in compliance with a 1995\r\nresolution of the SADC Inter-State Defence and Security\r\nCommittee in which SADC member States agreed to take\r\ncollective action in cases of attempted coups to remove\r\nlegitimate Governments by military means in the\r\nsubregion. It is in conformity with that very decision\r\ntaken by SADC that, as I speak, troops from the Republic\r\nof South Africa and the Republic of Botswana, two\r\nSADC countries, are involved in upholding the authority\r\nof the legal Government of Lesotho against army\r\nmutineers.\r\nMy country remains committed to the search for a\r\nnegotiated settlement to the crisis in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo in accordance with the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Charters of the United Nations, the\r\nOAU and of SADC. It will be recalled that since the\r\noutbreak of the conflict, Zimbabwe has hosted two\r\nsummits with a view to finding durable peace and\r\nstability in the Great Lakes region. The second Victoria\r\nFalls summit, held from 7 to 8 September 1998, called\r\nfor a ceasefire in the conflict in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo. Zimbabwe remains committed to this\r\nprocess. We appeal to the international community to\r\nsupport Africa’s various initiatives aimed at establishing\r\ndurable peace in the Great Lakes region.\r\nMy country is concerned about the situation in the\r\nHorn of Africa, where fraternal forces of the Federal\r\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia and Eritrea are facing\r\neach other, ready to go to war. We appeal to these\r\nbrotherly countries to continue cooperating with the OAU\r\nin the search for a peaceful resolution to the border\r\nconflict. In Western Sahara, we urge the parties to\r\ncomplete the Houston accords peace process by holding\r\nthe proposed referendum.\r\nWe condemn the recent killings of innocent people\r\nin the bombings of the American embassies in Nairobi\r\nand Dar-es-Salaam. We are disappointed by the stalemate\r\nin the Middle East peace process. We urge the\r\nGovernment of Israel to show flexibility in carrying\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nforward the peace process. The killing of Iranian diplomats\r\nin Afghanistan is regrettable and unacceptable in inter-State\r\nrelations. We urge the parties to the Lockerbie affair to\r\nseize the present opportunity to resolve this sad, long-\r\nstanding issue. We ask for good faith on all sides in order\r\nto carry the process forward.\r\nThe African continent continues to face a multitude of\r\nproblems as it settles into the new world order. African\r\ncountries are implementing painful political, social and\r\neconomic adjustments to existing structures in order to\r\nrespond to the twin processes of liberalization and\r\nglobalization. We have embarked on structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes, often at the behest of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions. These programmes have had a severely adverse\r\nimpact on the social welfare of the African countries. The\r\ncurtailment of expenditure on social programmes,\r\nparticularly health and educational facilities, in the absence\r\nof the requisite safety nets, has worsened the living\r\nconditions of the majority of the African peoples and in\r\nsome cases this has heightened instability and insecurity in\r\nour countries.\r\nFor many developing countries, the issue of resource\r\nflows cannot be dissociated from that of the external debt\r\nproblem. Figures continue to indicate that the overall debt\r\nof developing countries is still on the increase. We believe\r\nthat new, comprehensive and coordinated approaches to the\r\ndebt and debt-servicing problem have to be adopted,\r\nincluding outright forgiveness.\r\nThe critical economic situation in Africa, the least\r\ndeveloped and most marginalized of all regions, has to be\r\naddressed if global economic growth and interdependence\r\nare to have any meaning at all. Apart from the excruciating\r\nand debilitating debt, there is need for an increased flow of\r\nresources in the form of both official development\r\nassistance and foreign direct investment.\r\nI wish to conclude my remarks on economic matters\r\nby mentioning an issue that is of vital importance to the\r\nquestion of sustainable development: the World Solar\r\nProgramme 1996-2005, which was adopted by the World\r\nSolar Commission. The promotion and popularization of\r\nsolar energy technologies can be a major contribution to\r\nsolving the world’s energy crisis and ensuring the\r\navailability of a clean and inexhaustible source of energy\r\nfor sustainable development. I urge all Member States to\r\nsupport the draft resolution on the World Solar Programme,\r\nwhich will be presented at this session.\r\nIn the field of disarmament, the much vaunted peace\r\ndividend did not materialize at the end of the cold war.\r\nOn the contrary, it appears that an arms race is still with\r\nus, and it is my Government’s strong conviction that the\r\ninternational community must continue to work\r\npurposefully for nuclear disarmament, as well as for the\r\ntotal removal from the face of our planet of other\r\nweapons of mass destruction and for stricter control over\r\nthe production, sale and movement of small arms. My\r\ndelegation was deeply disappointed that the United\r\nNations Disarmament Commission this year concluded its\r\nsubstantive session without reaching an agreement on the\r\nneed for, or the agenda of, the fourth special session of\r\nthe General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We owe\r\nit to posterity to lay the foundations of a third millennium\r\nfree from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nMy Government welcomes the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings,\r\nadopted at the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly, and the recently adopted Statute of the\r\nproposed International Criminal Court. The international\r\ncommunity has long witnessed how ill-equipped Member\r\nStates of the United Nations have been in dealing with\r\ninternational terrorism, and for us in Africa the recent\r\nterrorist bombings of the United States embassies in\r\nNairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, which together claimed about\r\n260 lives, brought home to us the vulnerability of\r\ndeveloping countries to the sophistication of modern\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe Statute of the International Criminal Court has\r\nforged the missing link in the international legal order and\r\nis a genuine step forward in the field of human rights\r\nlaw. It has created new inter-State relationships and\r\ncomplementarity between national and international law.\r\nAs we come to the close of the Decade of International\r\nLaw, in 1999, we hope that the United Nations, especially\r\nthe Security Council, will also take decisions that will\r\nresult in the advancement of the primacy of the rule of\r\nlaw in international relations in the next century.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to make a brief\r\ncomment on the contemporary realities of the\r\ninternational situation. Our balance sheet leaves much to\r\nbe desired. On the credit side, we have seen a modest\r\nmeasure of success. We have witnessed a return to\r\ndemocracy and peace in some countries where once there\r\nwas military despotism and armed conflict. We have\r\nsuccessfully paved the way for the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court and forged new partnerships\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nbetween our regional organizations and the United Nations.\r\nYet we still have a daunting debit side. Conflicts still rage\r\nin many parts of the world. Poverty, inequality and\r\nunderdevelopment still remain the order of the day for 90\r\nper cent of the world’s population. The AIDS pandemic\r\nthreatens to reverse the socio-economic gains made in most\r\nof our countries over the years. The ongoing financial crisis\r\nwhich engulfed South-East Asia and now threatens the\r\nentire world reminds us that current efforts at a new\r\narchitecture both for controlling the free flow of money and\r\nushering in a new discipline in the financial institutions\r\nshould be brought about without delay. We have to\r\nconfront and reduce world poverty with determination at a\r\ntime when some within the Organization itself are still\r\nresisting the democratic changes that are necessary for\r\nenhancing the image and authority of the Organization and\r\nmaking it effective in addressing these problems. Zimbabwe\r\nbelieves that the time for change is here and now and that\r\nMember States have a moral obligation to muster the\r\npolitical will to make those changes.\r\nLet the fifty-third session of the General Assembly be\r\none of qualitative and meaningful change for the people of\r\nthe world.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe next speaker is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic, His Excellency Mr. Somsavat Lengsavad, on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)\r\n(spoke in Laotian; interpretation from French text furnished\r\nby the delegation): First of all, I should like to extend my\r\nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his well-\r\ndeserved election to the presidency of the fifty-third session\r\nof the General Assembly. His recognized skills as a veteran\r\ndiplomat and his extensive knowledge of international\r\naffairs augur well for the success of our deliberations.\r\nAs we assure him of our complete cooperation, my\r\ndelegation would like to wish him every possible success.\r\nI should like also to avail myself of this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization, for the crucial role that he has played in the\r\npreservation of peace and the promotion of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment throughout the world. We are extremely\r\ngrateful to him for the laudable efforts he has made in the\r\nfirst two difficult years of his term.\r\nIn the past year, the world situation has continued to\r\nundergo changes that are more profound and complex than\r\nin the preceding years. World peace continues to be just\r\nas fragile. In various regions of the world, civil wars,\r\nconflicts among States, border disputes and ethnic, tribal\r\nand religious confrontations continue to take place. Some\r\nof these events offer no glimmer of abatement, while\r\nothers have been deliberately provoked against the\r\nsovereignty of other States. In the face of this situation,\r\nit is important for the international community, in its\r\nrespect for the Charter of the United Nations, to focus its\r\nenergies and do its utmost to reduce tensions and assist\r\nthe countries concerned in resolving their problems by\r\nmeans of negotiations, thus favouring the current general\r\ntrend towards international cooperation for development.\r\nOn the eve of the third millennium, States and peoples\r\nthroughout the world should together endeavour to lay the\r\nappropriate solid foundations to construct a new era of\r\nrelations based on peace, social justice and equality.\r\nIn certain regions of Europe, there has been a\r\nresurgence of deadly ethnic conflicts, resulting in\r\nenormous losses in human lives and material property.\r\nWhile coming out in favour of the inviolability of\r\ninternationally recognized borders, we should like\r\nsincerely to appeal to the countries involved to show\r\nrestraint and resolve their conflicts through dialogue.\r\nIn Africa, we are still witnessing ethnic\r\nconfrontation, civil war and border conflicts that continue\r\ngravely to threaten peace, stability and cooperation. In\r\nview of the great suffering that the victimized peoples of\r\ncertain countries of the region must ensure, the\r\ninternational community must render its support and\r\nassistance to the countries concerned in their efforts to\r\nresolve their problems by peaceful means and as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nIn the Caribbean, an atmosphere of peace and\r\ncooperation continues to prevail. In this context, we\r\nprofoundly regret that the 30-year-plus economic,\r\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed on the\r\nRepublic of Cuba by the United States of America has\r\nnot yet been lifted. In the interest of regional and world\r\npeace as well as in the interest of both the Cuban and\r\nAmerican people, it is our hope that the two countries\r\nconcerned will commit themselves to reasonable\r\nnegotiations so as to resolve their dispute as soon as\r\npossible in conformity with the general trend obtaining\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nIn the Middle East, the situation appears tense. The\r\npeace process begun following the signature by the\r\nPalestine Liberation Organization and Israel of the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nWashington Accords of 1993 has run up against grave\r\ndifficulties in the past two years in the wake of the\r\nestablishments of new settlements in Har Homa in East\r\nJerusalem and of other unilateral measures that have been\r\ntaken. In our view, it is imperative for the parties involved\r\nimmediately to put an end to unilateral measures and\r\nspeedily to restore a climate of mutual trust and continue\r\nseriously in their negotiations to achieve a general\r\nsettlement based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\r\nand 338 (1973) and other relevant General Assembly\r\nresolutions in order to contribute to the restoration of peace,\r\nsecurity and cooperation in this very delicate region of the\r\nworld.\r\nOn the Korean peninsula in general we are witnessing\r\na reduction in tension. Contacts and talks among the parties\r\nconcerned are continuing in a spirit of respect for mutual\r\ninterests. While welcoming the efforts deployed, the\r\nGovernment and people of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic would like to reiterate their sincere support for the\r\nprofound aspirations of the Korean people to live in peace\r\nand to achieve the peaceful reunification of their cherished\r\nhomeland.\r\nIn South-East Asia multifaceted beneficial cooperation\r\namong States is continuing under good conditions.\r\nNevertheless, in the wake of the financial crisis that\r\noccurred more than a year ago, the countries of the region\r\nare now going through unprecedented grave economic\r\ndifficulties. But thanks mainly to national efforts and\r\nregional and international cooperation, these countries are,\r\nthrough adjustment programmes, engaged in a process of\r\nprofound economic restructuring in order to get back on\r\ntrack. The international community as a whole has been\r\ncalled upon to support them actively, particularly those\r\nmost affected.\r\nAnother important event that has characterized our\r\nregion was the holding last July of general elections in\r\nCambodia, the results of which have been recognized and\r\napproved by the international community. As a nearby\r\nneighbour, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic would\r\nlike to express the hope that the Cambodian parties\r\nconcerned will speedily form a coalition Government\r\nwhich, in accordance with the Constitution, will be headed\r\nby a prime minister from the party that has been elected by\r\nmajority which would contribute to the establishment of\r\nnational concord in Cambodia and the promotion of peace\r\nand stability in the region.\r\nIn the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, socio-\r\npolitical stability continues to be securely guaranteed. In\r\naccordance with the Constitution, national legislative\r\nelections took place on 21 December 1997. The new\r\nNational Assembly — the Fourth Legislature — has been\r\nset up and is made up of 99 members, including 21\r\nwomen, representing the three major ethnic groups of the\r\ncountry.\r\nIn the economic sphere, the implementation of a\r\nrecovery policy based on market mechanisms has\r\nproduced generally satisfactory results. However, the\r\nmonetary crisis that has severely afflicted all of South-\r\nEast Asia and even beyond for more than a year has\r\nconsiderably affected our economy. But, resolutely basing\r\npolicies on the principle of self-reliance and enjoying\r\nexternal cooperation, the Lao Government has mobilized\r\nall of its capacity in human, intellectual, natural and\r\nmaterial resources to reduce to the minimum the adverse\r\neffects of this crisis on our society and to achieve\r\nnormalization.\r\nWhile some can gain in this era of globalization and\r\neconomic liberalization, the fact is that most developing\r\ncountries, particularly the least developed, have been\r\nlargely marginalized and exposed to enormous difficulties\r\nand risks. In this context, the developed countries must do\r\neverything possible to render the necessary assistance to\r\nthese countries so that they might catch up in their\r\nlagging development and have a share in the progress of\r\nthe times.\r\nDrug abuse continues to figure prominently on the\r\ninternational agenda. In this connection, the Government\r\nof the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has taken the\r\nnecessary measures with a view to reducing production\r\nand banning the illicit trafficking in drugs, opium in\r\nparticular. The results of these measures are satisfactory.\r\nHowever, the illegal introduction of synthetic drugs from\r\nabroad is still our main concern. In this connection, we\r\nwelcome the unanimous adoption by the General\r\nAssembly at its twentieth special session of the Political\r\nDeclaration and a programme of action, and we express\r\nthe hope that the international community as a whole will\r\nmobilize itself and marshall the necessary financial\r\nresources to implement this ambitious programme.\r\nThe question of human rights is no less important in\r\nmy country. Thus, on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, my Government has officially announced the\r\nestablishment of a national committee to commemorate\r\nthis day solemnly on a wide scale with the sole purpose\r\nof publicizing the contents of the Declaration among the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nmulti-ethnic Lao people and to promote harmony and\r\nmutual respect in our society.\r\nThe world today is confronted with numerous\r\nchallenges. World peace remains fragile. Under-\r\ndevelopment, poverty, hunger and disease are among the\r\npriority problems that must be resolved. With the purpose\r\nof consolidating peace and achieving development\r\nthroughout the world, the United Nations, our only\r\nuniversal multilateral forum, must make an important\r\ncontribution. To be able to fulfil its mission in this new era,\r\nour Organization needs to restructure itself or to reorganize\r\nitself to be more effective.\r\nIn this connection, we would like to express our great\r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\r\nreform initiatives he presented last year. Of course, these\r\nreforms which must, inter alia, stress the strengthening the\r\nrole of the Organization and the promotion of development,\r\nrepresent an ongoing and difficult process. But in order for\r\nthem to succeed, a solid financial basis must be assured. In\r\nthat vein, it is high time that, in conformity with the United\r\nNations Charter, all the Member States, particularly the\r\nmain contributors, fulfil their financial commitments in full\r\nand on time. In so doing, we are giving the incipient\r\nreforms a chance, and in the final analysis we would be\r\ninfusing energy into our Organization so that it could\r\ndischarge its lofty mission as it confronts the challenges of\r\nour times.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nDenmark, His Excellency Niels Helveg Petersen.\r\nMr. Petersen (Denmark): Let me first associate\r\nmyself with the statement by my colleague, the Austrian\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nWe embark upon this session of the General Assembly\r\nin the midst of challenges that affect all continents. We can\r\ndeal with those challenges only if we display resolve and a\r\ncommon vision.\r\nThat vision, clear and simple, is enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. We must strive to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security, respect for human rights\r\nand dignified living conditions for all. Every State joining\r\nthe United Nations has committed itself to that vision.\r\nTo realize our vision, the rule of law must prevail. We\r\nbase our national societies on the rule of law, and much is\r\nmade of the rule of law within our societies. The rule of\r\nlaw offers the strongest defense against arbitrary exercise\r\nof power, but we sometimes neglect its importance in the\r\ninternational context.\r\nMy call for greater commitment to the rule of law\r\ninternationally is not meant to belittle the progress made.\r\nThe Charter has inspired an impressive body of specific\r\ntreaty law governing the behaviour of States. Laws on\r\nhuman rights, disarmament, the environment and outer\r\nspace, and the law of the sea and international trade law\r\nare important examples.\r\nWe celebrate this year the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by\r\nthe General Assembly in December 1948. The\r\nDeclaration covers civil and political rights, as well as\r\neconomic, social, and cultural rights. It has had an\r\nimmense impact upon the standard-setting work of the\r\nUnited Nations and within each Member State.\r\nHuman rights are universal. They must be\r\nguaranteed to all persons without discrimination and\r\nobserved by all countries irrespective of their form of\r\ngovernment. That is the essence of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Indeed, it would be\r\ncontradictory to talk about human rights if they were not\r\naccorded to all human beings, wherever they live.\r\nTo deny the universality of human rights is to deny\r\nour common humanity. Freedom from torture, for\r\nexample, must be respected everywhere, regardless of\r\nlocal traditions or local problems. Obviously, situations\r\ndiffer, but the human rights foundation is the same\r\neverywhere.\r\nAll States in Vienna in 1993 reaffirmed that the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights constitutes a\r\ncommon standard of achievement for all peoples and all\r\nnations. All States further proclaimed that the promotion\r\nand protection of human rights is a legitimate concern of\r\nthe international community.\r\nA feature of present-day international law is that, by\r\nnow, we have almost all the standards against which to\r\nhold Governments accountable for their acts. What we are\r\nstill missing is an effective international machinery to\r\nensure the implementation of all the rules in practice —\r\nto move from declarations to deeds. I wish to pay special\r\ntribute to the many human rights defenders who struggle\r\nin the front line for the defence of our common human\r\nvalues, often at the greatest personal risk.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nIt is a most proper contribution by the United Nations\r\nto adopt this year a declaration for the protection of the\r\nwork of human rights defenders, those who strive to realize\r\nthe solemn pledges contained in the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights.\r\nWe also warmly welcome the progress made in firmly\r\nestablishing the rights of indigenous peoples.\r\nAnother landmark contribution was achieved this year\r\nthrough the historic adoption in Rome of a Statute for a\r\npermanent International Criminal Court. Time and again,\r\nwe have observed the failure of national criminal law\r\nsystems to punish the perpetrators of atrocities and those\r\nbehind them. The shocking events from Cambodia, the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and now Kosovo and\r\nelsewhere are fresh on our minds.\r\nThe prospects for reconciliation and lasting peace are\r\nundermined if the perpetrators remain at large. A key\r\nobjective of the International Criminal Court is exactly to\r\nrestore the rule of law and end impunity. This is a matter\r\nnot only of justice, but also of peace and security. The ad\r\nhoc Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia have\r\nbeen an important first step, but only a preliminary step.\r\nWe need a permanent institution.\r\nDenmark urges all States to ratify the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. It is an urgent task to set this\r\nhistoric building block in the construction of international\r\nsociety in place. In light of experiences gained, the door is\r\nopen for adjusting the functioning of the Court to the needs\r\nof the world community. The review clause in the\r\nStatute — a proposition strongly advocated by Denmark all\r\nalong in the negotiations — assures that.\r\nThe signature in December last year in Ottawa by 121\r\nStates of the Convention to ban the use and production of\r\nanti-personnel landmines has established a very important\r\nnorm in international humanitarian law. For too long has\r\nthis inhumane, indiscriminate weapon been allowed to\r\nclaim thousands of innocent civilian victims every year. We\r\nwelcome the entry into force of the Convention by 1 March\r\n1999. Let us now intensify our joint efforts to clear the\r\nmany mines already in the ground. Denmark offers its\r\ncontinued support.\r\nA most disturbing factor in the international legal\r\norder are the terrorist attacks taking innocent lives and\r\njeopardizing relations among States. The international\r\ncommunity must continue to condemn all acts, methods and\r\npractices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable under\r\nall circumstances, wherever and by whomsoever committed.\r\nNo ends justify such means, but, apparently,\r\ncondemnation is not enough. We need to further\r\nstrengthen international cooperation to prevent, combat\r\nand eliminate terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. There must be no safe haven for terrorists.\r\nThose responsible for terrorist acts must be brought to\r\njustice. If traditional extradition agreements cannot bring\r\nabout such a result, less traditional arrangements must be\r\ncontemplated, as envisaged in regard to the horrendous\r\nterrorist bombing over Lockerbie.\r\nIn May this year, India, regrettably, decided to\r\nresume nuclear testing after 24 years of self-imposed\r\nrestraint. Pakistan, regrettably, followed India’s lead and\r\nconducted its own tests for the first time. These tests not\r\nonly contradict the non-test norm that had developed over\r\nthe past two years. They also endanger peace and stability\r\nin the region and internationally. Therefore, the nuclear\r\ntesting by India and Pakistan is of legitimate concern to\r\nthe international community.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons enjoys almost universal support. A substantial\r\nnumber of countries have ratified the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and more are following every\r\nmonth. These two Treaties are the cornerstones of the\r\ninternational non-proliferation regime and the foundation\r\nfor the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. I urge those\r\ncountries — including India and Pakistan — that have not\r\nyet done so, to sign and move to ratify these Treaties\r\nwithout condition.\r\nThis year marks the first half-century of United\r\nNations peacekeeping. The first mission was established\r\n50 years ago, based on the goals of the United Nations\r\nCharter. Since then, United Nations peacekeeping has\r\ndeveloped norms and principles of its own: consent of the\r\nparties, impartiality and non-use of force. These principles\r\ncontinue to guide the international community’s efforts in\r\nsecuring peace and stability on all continents.\r\nPeacekeeping operations are an important illustration\r\nof the resolve of the international community, represented\r\nby the United Nations. Their successes are real. In the\r\nMiddle East and Cyprus, the United Nations has been a\r\nsource of stability for many years. In Mozambique,\r\nUnited Nations peacekeepers have demobilized thousands\r\nof combatants and made room for democratic elections.\r\nIn the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nUnited Nations preventive deployment remains an essential\r\nstabilizing factor. And in Bosnia and Herzegovina today,\r\nthe United Nations is responsible for the crucial task of\r\ntraining and restructuring local police forces.\r\nDenmark has a long tradition of contributing to United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. Danish forces took part\r\nfrom the very beginning and have served the United\r\nNations faithfully for the last five decades. In recent years,\r\nDanish forces have served all over the world, from the\r\nMiddle East to the Balkans, as well as in Asia and in\r\nAfrica.\r\nToday’s peacekeeping challenges differ from those of\r\nearlier decades and much work has been done to adjust the\r\nUnited Nations to the new challenges. Denmark has taken\r\nan active part in the process. Together with other countries,\r\nDenmark aims to improve the United Nations capacity for\r\nrapid reaction within the framework of the standby system.\r\nDenmark is also engaged in the creation of a new\r\npeacekeeping capacity of the Baltic States and of southern\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe demand for adjustment and reform continues.\r\nThere is still work to be done in areas such as preplanning\r\nand logistic support. But peacekeeping goes beyond military\r\noperations. A broader, integrated approach involving\r\ncomponents such as civilian police, preventive diplomacy\r\nand humanitarian assistance is called for. Such conceptual\r\nflexibility will add to the strength of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nWe, the United Nations Members, must be ready to\r\nmeet our obligations and equip the Organization with the\r\nnecessary tools for these future challenges. We must also,\r\nof course, ensure the safety of personnel working for the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe are witnessing an enhanced role for regional\r\norganizations. Their special expertise has proved valuable\r\nin addressing causes of conflict and establishing a basis for\r\nsettlement. The Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe is a good example.\r\nA division of labour between organizations is\r\nnecessary, but it must not lead to confusion in leadership\r\nand responsibility. The United Nations remains the core\r\ninstitution in the international legal order and must maintain\r\na central role in international efforts to ensure peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe are approaching the twenty-first century, a\r\ncentury in which international society also should be\r\ngoverned by the rule of law. The norms of international\r\nlaw are universal but, sadly, they are not always\r\nuniversally respected.\r\nRespect for national sovereignty cannot be invoked\r\nas an excuse to avoid the obligations of international\r\ncooperation and international law. International criticism\r\nof violations of human rights and of international\r\nhumanitarian law is fully legitimate.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in this respect\r\nremains crucial. Indeed, direct intervention by the\r\ninternational community through the United Nations can\r\nbe fully justified and legitimate, including in grave cases\r\nof humanitarian law being violated.\r\nRespect for the rule of law in international relations\r\ncan be ensured only if the international community and\r\nthe United Nations possess the instruments and the\r\nresolve to act. In this respect, regrettably, we must note\r\na certain paralysis in recent years in the face of grave\r\nhumanitarian conflicts and emergencies.\r\nDisagreement among Member States on how to deal\r\nwith a particular crisis weakens the resolve of the United\r\nNations to act. But we must, unfortunately, also note a\r\nlack of general support for the United Nations in certain\r\nquarters. The least we can expect from Members is for\r\nthem to make the necessary resources available for the\r\nOrganization, inter alia, by paying their contributions in\r\nfull, on time and without conditions.\r\nWe must find ways which enhance the ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to deal with violations of international\r\npeace and security and other serious breaches of\r\ninternational law. Failure to act on such challenges is\r\nmorally indefensible and betrays the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nViolations and breaches must be met convincingly,\r\nwith resolve and with the legitimacy of international law.\r\nLegitimacy will usually be provided by the Security\r\nCouncil. That is how it should be. Disagreement in the\r\nSecurity Council about a particular line of action must,\r\nhowever, never lead to the paralysis of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIf, for instance, members of the Security Council\r\ncannot agree on a mandate for a peace operation, they\r\nmust allow for other possibilities for effective action.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nWhen faced with an urgent agenda, the option should not\r\nbe action or no action, but what line of action.\r\nThere will usually be a broad range of actions\r\navailable for the international community. It is a question\r\nof choice and political will. It does not suffice to leave\r\neverything to the humanitarian agencies. Emergency relief,\r\nhowever necessary, is not a substitute for political action.\r\nA reform of the Security Council can serve to\r\nstrengthen the authority of the Council. But in the end we\r\ndepend on the readiness of the members of the Council to\r\nact and to apply the same yardstick to all cases.\r\nI should also like to emphasize the role and\r\nprerogatives of the Secretary-General in the field of peace\r\nand security. The Secretary-General has exercised these\r\nfunctions in a highly commendable way.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to refer to the normative\r\nrole of the United Nations as an important aspect of the\r\nrule of law. In particular, the United Nations conferences of\r\nthe past decade have set valuable norms for improving\r\nliving conditions for mankind. Common standards have\r\nbeen set in such important areas as eradication of poverty,\r\nenvironmentally sustainable development, gender equality\r\nand promotion and protection of human rights.\r\nAchievements have been made in meeting these\r\nstandards, but much remains to be done. The responsibility\r\nfalls both to Member States and to the international\r\ninstitutions. The United Nations system must ensure, on its\r\npart, an effective and coordinated follow-up to the global\r\nUnited Nations conferences.\r\nIt is our collective responsibility to ensure that the\r\nfinancial resources are provided to attain these common\r\nstandards. Denmark will continue to contribute development\r\nassistance in the amount of 1 per cent of our gross national\r\nproduct.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing my conviction that the\r\nbest way to promote the rule of law in international\r\nrelations is through respect for democratic norms in our\r\nown societies.\r\nThe norm-setting activities of the United Nations have\r\ngiven an indispensable impetus towards democratization and\r\ngood governance. Assistance to the establishment of\r\ndemocratic institutions in developing countries and\r\ncountries with economies in transition can also make an\r\nimportant contribution. This is an overriding objectives of\r\nDenmark’s considerable assistance to those countries.\r\nWhatever challenges we face to the international\r\nlegal order, we must never fail in our determination to\r\nfollow the words of the preamble of the Charter:\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the\r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\r\nand small”.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe next speaker on my list is the Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Panama, His Excellency Mr. Aquilino Boyd.\r\nMr. Boyd (Panama) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nAt the outset, we wish to express our heartfelt\r\ncondolences and solidarity to the peoples of the Caribbean\r\nbecause of the suffering being experienced today in places\r\nsuch as Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, St.\r\nMaarten, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic due to\r\nHurricane Georges, which has hit the region.\r\nThe delegation I am honoured to represent joins in\r\nthe congratulations extended to Mr. Opertti on his election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. This constitutes a recognition not only of his\r\noutstanding ability and merits, but also of the brotherly\r\ncountry of Uruguay, whose well-known international\r\ncalling makes it an outstanding Member and\r\nrepresentative of Latin America in this important\r\ninternational body.\r\nWe are also grateful to his illustrious predecessor,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his efforts to contribute to\r\nthe Organization’s modernization.\r\nAt the end of June, during the absence of the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Panama, as Vice-\r\nPresident, occupied the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly and had the honour of cooperating in the\r\nadoption of important measures on science, technology\r\nand computers.\r\nOur gratitude goes also to the seventh Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, with the long experience\r\nhe has gained over more than 30 years devoted to the\r\nOrganization, is promoting reforms that will be of great\r\nbenefit to the United Nations.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nOn Security Council reform, we endorse the\r\nrecommendation of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council that consideration of this\r\nitem should continue during the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the basis of the work carried out in\r\nprevious sessions.\r\nPanama recalls with gratitude that the holding of a\r\nSecurity Council meeting in Panama a quarter of a century\r\nago and the support of the international community were\r\nextremely valuable to the Panamanian people in the\r\nfulfilment of its aspirations regarding the Canal.\r\nPanama attaches great importance to discussions\r\nrelating to economic issues, particularly those addressing\r\nsustainable economic development in order to eradicate\r\npoverty. We feel that by improving our education, our\r\ncountries will better be able to focus on processes of\r\nreform, which must be undertaken gradually.\r\nWith regard to the globalization of the economy, the\r\nRepublic of Panama congratulates the Secretary-General for\r\nhaving held on the 17 and 18 September a high-level\r\ndialogue on the social and economic impact of globalization\r\nand the interdependence of its political consequences.\r\nPanama feels that the matters before the Fifth\r\nCommittee relating to the process of adopting the budget\r\nare of great importance to the Organization, and we hope\r\nthat Member States will faithfully comply with its\r\nsuggestions.\r\nMy delegation believes that we should give full\r\nsupport to measures that will persuade Member States to\r\npay on time and in full their obligations to the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn our judgment, the most important tasks to be\r\naccomplished in order to neutralize the present economic\r\ncrisis are the restoration of trust in the markets; the\r\nstabilization of the financial markets; the support of growth;\r\nallocation of the necessary means to the international\r\nfinancial institutions; and the immediate protection of the\r\nmost vulnerable.\r\nThe financial markets and their problems are of global\r\nscope, yet the governmental efforts to resolve those\r\nproblems have a strictly local range. This disparity is at the\r\nroot of many problems we are now facing.\r\nEconomic globalization makes it necessary to\r\nstrengthen the links of the United Nations with the World\r\nBank, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Inter-American\r\nDevelopment Bank (IADB).\r\nThe need to create an even playing field in the\r\ninternational system for economic cooperation is urgent\r\nand justifies the major efforts ongoing within the United\r\nNations to restructure what has been called the\r\n“architecture” of the system.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s repeated calls\r\nfor more vigorous action towards some way of alleviating\r\nthe enormous debts that are suffocating many countries\r\nand that they simply cannot carry. It seems to us that\r\neconomic, social and environmental policy dimensions\r\nmust be integrated in such a way that none of them is\r\nsacrificed for the sake of the others.\r\nWe were deeply impressed by the wise counsel on\r\npoverty given to us yesterday by President Mandela.\r\nWe urge the Secretary-General and the community\r\nof the United Nations to continue our efforts to ensure\r\nthat the obvious benefits of globalization and its resultant\r\ninterdependence do not serve to make the rich richer and\r\nthe poor poorer. This could be done by establishing\r\nmechanisms that redirect part of the wealth generated to\r\nthe praiseworthy goals of creating more hospitals, more\r\nmodern schools and a higher standard of living for all\r\npeople.\r\nPanama has contributed to the cause of sustainable\r\neconomic development by complying with Agenda 21 and\r\nthe mandates of the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development. The concrete result of\r\nthis was the adoption of Law 41 of July 1998, an overall\r\nenvironmental law for the Republic of Panama, which\r\nestablishes the basic principles and regulations for\r\nprotecting, preserving and restoring the environment.\r\nAnother result is the preparation of an environmental\r\nstrategy for the country within the framework of a process\r\nin which the whole of Panamanian society is\r\nparticipating; actions are concerted, and each sector is\r\ncommitted to holding up its end.\r\nWe must have a clear vision of the future where\r\nanything related to the environment is concerned, and we\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nare sure that the Secretary-General will also make this clear\r\nin his plans for the future.\r\nPanama has followed with great interest the events\r\nrelating to peace in the Middle East and the problems of\r\nthe war-torn former Yugoslavia. We support the\r\ncomprehensive policy that must be pursued in Africa in\r\norder to move beyond the causes of conflict and promote\r\nlasting peace and sustainable development in the region.\r\nSimilarly, we have followed with great interest the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to advance the negotiations\r\ntowards just and lasting peace in Cyprus so that the\r\nunification process can quickly be consolidated. We see\r\nserious dangers in the situation in Afghanistan.\r\nAt the Conference in Rome, my country agreed with\r\nall that was said in favour of the establishment of an\r\nInternational Criminal Court, and we are prepared, along\r\nwith other Member States in the General Assembly, to\r\nmake every effort necessary so that this court can bring to\r\njustice those who have committed serious crimes that are of\r\nconcern to the international community.\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, we recall with\r\nrespect and admiration the work carried out by the great\r\nPanamanian internationalist Mr. Ricardo J. Alfaro, who was\r\ninstrumental in the drafting of this document that is so\r\nimportant to humanity.\r\nWe will always be attentive to the need for United\r\nNations programmes and policies to express the concern we\r\nfeel over the violations of human rights that still occur in\r\ncertain places.\r\nWith the establishment of its Ministry for Youth,\r\nWomen, Children and the Family, the Republic of Panama\r\nhas taken a very active part in protecting the rights of\r\nchildren in the workplace and is vigorously combating all\r\naspects of prostitution and child pornography. We therefore\r\napplaud the work being carried out by the Committee on\r\nthe Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and we\r\nnote with great satisfaction the effective work being done\r\nin this area by the Office of the First Lady of Panama.\r\nWe noted with concern the nuclear tests conducted by\r\nIndia and Pakistan, and condemned them at the time, since\r\nthey run counter to the principles of non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons. At the same time, we would like to see\r\nimplemented all the agreements included in the chemical\r\nand biological weapons conventions.\r\nPanama continues to take an interest in the ban on\r\nanti-personnel landmines, and we are ever vigilant to\r\nensure that our territory is free of these extremely\r\ndangerous mines.\r\nThe recent acts of terrorism in Africa and Europe are\r\nserious and unjustifiable crimes. They show clearly the\r\nneed to further strengthen the legal and political\r\nframework to combat this scourge. We share the concerns\r\nexpressed here yesterday regarding the dangers of\r\nterrorism.\r\nAs we stated at the recent Summit of Heads of State\r\nand Government of the Rio Group, which was held in our\r\ncountry, we reaffirm the importance of strengthening\r\ncooperation to combat terrorism at both the bilateral and\r\nmultilateral levels, with full respect for the sovereignty\r\nand jurisdiction of each State.\r\nInternationally, we reiterate our commitment to and\r\nsupport for efforts by the international community to\r\ncombat terrorism, since terrorist activities, whatever their\r\npurpose and motivation, are, in addition to being a\r\nviolation of human rights, immoral criminal acts, extreme\r\nacts of fanaticism that attack freedom, human life and the\r\ndevelopment of peoples.\r\nRegarding drug-trafficking, we are convinced that\r\nthe most effective way to make progress in combating\r\ndrugs would be to see it as a multilateral problem, always\r\nbearing in mind respect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of each country. Panama therefore firmly\r\nsupports the tasks and commitments established at the\r\ntwentieth special session of the General Assembly, which\r\nwas devoted to the common struggle against the world\r\ndrug problem, as well as the principles and\r\nresponsibilities established by the Organization of\r\nAmerican States in this matter.\r\nFrom 4 to 6 September, just a few days ago, a\r\nmeeting of the heads of State and Government of the Rio\r\nGroup was held in Panama, this year’s Secretariat of the\r\nRio Group, a consultative body for political harmony\r\ncomprising 14 Latin American countries. The Latin\r\nAmerican community is increasingly convinced that with\r\nsolid cooperation resulting from political consensus of the\r\nRio Group member States we can make greater strides at\r\nboth the national and international levels.\r\nThrough the annual meetings of the heads of State\r\nand Government and the Foreign Ministers of the region\r\nwe have established common objectives and\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\ncommitments, which cover strengthening our democracies,\r\nquestions of international peace and security, drug-\r\ntrafficking, terrorism, human rights, combating poverty,\r\nsustainable development and international trade, as well as\r\nnew issues, such as the year 2000 computer problem and\r\nthe international financial crisis.\r\nAt the Rio Group meeting held in Quito in 1995, the\r\nRepublic of Panama offered its territory as the headquarters\r\nfor a forum where countries of the region could join in\r\nconsidering policies and measures aimed to eradicate\r\ntrafficking in narcotics and other illicit substances, as well\r\nas in coordinating anti-drug measures and training\r\nprogrammes, which effectively support our efforts to\r\ncombat drug-trafficking in the region.\r\nThe Universal Congress on the Panama Canal, meeting\r\nin our capital from 7 to 10 September 1997, clearly showed\r\nthe need for contact with the international maritime\r\ncommunity, the users and clients of the Canal, and\r\nconsidered creating an advisory board of the Canal\r\nAuthority, in order to make use of the experience and\r\nwisdom of men and women throughout the world.\r\nWe reiterate our pledge that the Panama Canal will\r\nalways be a public service, international in character and\r\nefficient and safe, without any form of discrimination. We\r\nare ready to assume full management of the Panama Canal\r\non 31 December 1999, thus consolidating our territory\r\nunder a single flag.\r\nThis is an appropriate occasion to reaffirm to the\r\ninternational community that after 31 December 1999\r\nPanama will never again renounce control of the Canal,\r\nwhich is in our territory; it will be a symbol of the\r\naspirations of many generations of Panamanians who have\r\nwanted this Canal to be an integral part of our territory in\r\na free, independent and sovereign nation.\r\nIn conclusion, I believe it is fitting to recall here the\r\nfollowing words of the President of Panama, Dr. Ernesto\r\nPérez Balladares, to our Legislative Assembly on 1\r\nSeptember:\r\n“I wish to reiterate once again my commitment\r\nto democracy and my commitment to prepare for the\r\ntransfer of the Canal without exclusions and without\r\npolitical sectarianism. The elections on 2 May 1999\r\nwill determine who will lead the country into the\r\ntwenty-first century and who will close once and for\r\nall this historic era for our territory. For my part, I am\r\ncertain that on 1 September 1999 there will be a\r\nPresident and a Legislative Assembly elected\r\nthrough transparent and democratic elections; that\r\nour nation is now prepared to assume full control of\r\nthe Canal and its adjacent areas; and that, above all,\r\nthe country will be reconciled, in peace and prepared\r\nto enter the next millennium without the presence of\r\nforeign military bases and with a modern,\r\nprosperous economy.”\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Erik Derycke, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Belgium.\r\nMr. Derycke (Belgium) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I would first like to congratulate our colleague,\r\nthe Uruguayan Minister Didier Opertti, on his election to\r\nthe presidency of our General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to associate myself with the\r\nstatement made by our colleague, Mr. Wolfgang Schüssel,\r\nwho spoke on behalf of the European Union. My country\r\nshares and supports entirely the concerns and objectives\r\nhe outlined.\r\nUnprecedented crises over the last few months have\r\nshaken our economies and the economies of the entire\r\nregion. To varying degrees, the economies of the world\r\nhave all sustained the social and political consequences of\r\ninterdependence and the information systems that link\r\nthem. It therefore seems to me that the time has come to\r\nrethink seriously the way in which international\r\ninstitutions and national Governments deal with the\r\ntensions and constraints which result from globalization.\r\nThis means specifically that we must reflect upon\r\nthe quality of life humankind will have in the next\r\ncentury. Despite worrisome forecasts, we seem unable to\r\ncome up with a list of priorities which reflects the global\r\npublic interest. We must establish a common frame of\r\nreference that ensures the peaceful coexistence of States\r\nand their citizens while at the same time respecting their\r\ndiversity. This task is the indispensable corollary of\r\nglobalization, which has numerous ramifications for\r\ncurrent problems. The international community’s\r\nresponses have therefore been flawed and partial and\r\nsubject to corporate logic and a narrow view of the\r\nissues.\r\nThe limitations of these responses are well known to\r\nus. Countless children died last year from diseases which\r\ncould have been eradicated. Tropical forests covering an\r\narea equivalent to three times the size of Belgium\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\ndisappeared. The developing world’s debt remains\r\nuntenably large, while expenditures for weapons continues\r\nto grow. Incalculable numbers of people have been\r\ndetained, tortured, killed or forced to flee their countries.\r\nHundreds of innocent victims have lost their lives in\r\nterrorist attacks.\r\nGlobal information networks and new technologies\r\nreduce distances. Thanks to television, more than one\r\nbillion people can today discover both man’s incredible\r\ninventions and the worst abuses he is capable of. This is a\r\nscenario which touches our conscience.\r\nToday’s crises affect the entire global system and call\r\nfor solutions on the same level. The only way to respond\r\neffectively is to give a greater role to international solidarity\r\nand social justice. Those are the two pillars of the new\r\ninternational ethic that I would like to call for today. This\r\nis not a simple task. No Government likes to limit its room\r\nto manoeuvre, even for just causes, if it is the only one\r\npaying the price for its commitments.\r\nI am nevertheless convinced that the United Nations\r\nis the best forum to have a debate on this matter of\r\ninternational public interest. It is here, and nowhere else,\r\nthat we can draw up universally accepted norms that have\r\nthe approval of the largest possible number of States. The\r\nOrganization can help us strengthen international consensus\r\nand the acceptance of codes of conduct designed to set the\r\nboundaries of human dignity and peaceful coexistence.\r\nEconomic and financial power dominates the world,\r\nbut the last few months have shown that it is not capable of\r\nrunning it. The globalization of political life and civil\r\nsociety leads us to attempt to reach beyond national\r\nlimitations to confront our problems. Liberalization has\r\ngenerated significant growth in trade and investments. It has\r\nalso led to increased transparency between our different\r\nsocial systems. This transparency obliges us more than in\r\nthe past to reflect upon our concepts of the rights of the\r\nindividual and the need to defend them.\r\nHowever, access to the global economic village has\r\nnot led to a concomitant strengthening of solidarity. The\r\ncapacity of men and women to adapt has been severely put\r\nto the test. The grip of the logic of the marketplace on the\r\nindividual seems to relegate him to a secondary role in the\r\ninternational system. Our societies should henceforth\r\nreconcile the often very divergent effects that globalization\r\nhas on the individual and on the State — namely,\r\nunemployment, competition and financial speculation. The\r\nbalance between the freedom of some and the rights of\r\nothers is all too often disturbed. Marginalization and\r\nabject poverty are reappearing, thereby threatening the\r\nexercise of the most fundamental of rights. After the\r\n1980s — a lost decade, from the point of view of\r\ndevelopment — the decade of structural adjustments has\r\nbeen unable to put economies back on the road to\r\nsustainable development. Differences in income, both at\r\nthe level of society and at the global level, have been\r\naccentuated. What can we do? What must we do?\r\nThe Internet and the financial markets by themselves\r\ncannot hold the international community together. We\r\nknow that Governments alone are incapable of dealing\r\nwith the problems with which they are confronted. This\r\nis why new forms of solidarity and new ways of dealing\r\nwith these issues are indispensable. Only a strong political\r\ninternational organization can counterbalance the forces of\r\nthe financial markets. The loss of power of nation-States\r\nover financial and economic decisions is glaring; the\r\nsocial consequences are even more so. This does not call\r\ninto question the existing consensus on the validity of\r\ncontrolled liberalization of trade, but it does put all\r\nGovernments up against the wall. Has the time not come\r\nfor some sort of regulation that benefits everyone?\r\nIndeed, liberalization cannot be an end in itself. It\r\nhas no purpose if it does not contribute to social progress\r\nfor the largest possible number of people. We should\r\ntherefore strive together to find concerted responses to the\r\nuncontrolled and painful effects of this evolution by\r\nstrengthening public control throughout the world. In this\r\nregard some have proposed an economic security council.\r\nThis is obviously an ambitious idea, but it does serve to\r\nshow how serious the threat of financial instability and\r\neconomic uncertainty is to our societies. In any case, an\r\nintensified dialogue between the United Nations and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions must be instituted as a first\r\nstep.\r\nOf course, regional strategies have been developed\r\nto strengthen economic convergence in certain regions\r\nand to integrate them into zones. Nevertheless, these\r\nregional strategies should respect the rules of\r\nmultilateralism. Efficient partnerships based on mutual\r\ntrade have to be developed with other regions without\r\nmarginalizing third States. Developing countries must be\r\nintegrated in commerce and enjoy the fruits of market\r\nliberalization. In this respect, my country supports the\r\nefforts placed on record by the European Union in the\r\nspirit referred to as “fair trade”.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nI would now like to say a few words about the United\r\nNations, which is at the centre of all these interactions. I\r\nsay to you, the representatives of the 185 nations committed\r\nto the pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations, that\r\nwe have all too often forgotten our obligations under the\r\nCharter. Now that we are free of the shackles of the cold\r\nwar and its ideological deadlocks, the obligation to\r\nstrengthen cohesion between States and to promote social\r\njustice is more than ever the real order of business.\r\nIn this respect, I support the proposal to devote the\r\nMillennium Assembly to the issue of the fight against\r\npoverty. The gaze of much of the world will be turned\r\ntowards the United Nations at that time. It would be a\r\nterrible failure if on that occasion we were only able to\r\nrefer poverty to various committees, soothing our\r\nconscience with meetings of fleeting significance. As the\r\nSecretary-General stresses in his report, the fight against\r\npoverty starts with good governance. Political\r\ndemocratization and mechanisms for revenue sharing are\r\nindispensable elements.\r\nThe question of Central Africa is currently of\r\nparticular importance for Africa. After hopes were raised\r\nfor what some wanted to call an African renaissance, the\r\ncontinent has again become prey to violence that is\r\nbecoming dangerously ethnic in character. Once again, the\r\nprincipal victims are among the most vulnerable people in\r\nthe world.\r\nThe crisis in the Great Lakes region is a moral\r\nchallenge for the United Nations. It imposes on us the duty\r\nof solidarity. We must help Africa to find solutions and to\r\nimplement them without interfering or trying to impose\r\nsolutions. The United Nations, together with the relevant\r\nregional and subregional organizations, should involve itself\r\nin an initiative to restore dialogue to the region and to put\r\nconfidence-building measures in place. I believe that a\r\nconference on regional security and cooperation in the\r\nGreat Lakes region — if it is viewed as a process rather\r\nthan as a single event — could serve as the vehicle for\r\nstabilizing the region. My country is willing to support such\r\nan initiative.\r\nPolitical instability, uninterrupted violence and\r\nchallenges to the nation State have led to large-scale\r\npopulation movements. In Central Africa, Kosovo and\r\nelsewhere, hundreds of thousands of families have been\r\nforced to flee their homes and their land. It is our shared\r\nduty to continue to assist humanitarian organizations in\r\ntheir efforts to come to the aid of these refugees and to\r\nenable them to return home. However, sometimes, when the\r\nroads or the family land are littered with landmines and\r\nchildren cannot go to school without being exposed to\r\nphysical danger, returning can be a problem. We must rid\r\nourselves of these landmines; their production must stop.\r\nThese devices of death must be for ever banished from\r\nthe Earth.\r\nI welcome the entry into force of the Convention on\r\nthe total prohibition of anti-personnel landmines and\r\nappeal to donor and victim countries to support the\r\nintegrated activities undertaken by the United Nations in\r\nthis field, including through voluntary financial\r\ncontributions.\r\nBut that is not enough. Conflict prevention should be\r\na priority, and within our Organization we must also pay\r\nattention to the less spectacular aspects of conflict\r\nprevention, such as early warning and the establishment\r\nof an appropriate United Nations presence on the ground.\r\nConflict prevention will make no sense if we do not\r\nat the same time put an end to the acquisition of arms by\r\nthose who attempt to resolve their problems through\r\nviolence. Belgium has responded positively to the\r\nEuropean Union initiative to formulate a code of conduct\r\nfor arms transactions. My country is also a strong\r\nadvocate of giving the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms effective universal application. It is\r\nalso behind several initiatives designed to block the illegal\r\ntransfer of small arms. The Brussels conference, which\r\nwill take place in October, and our participation on the\r\nPanel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms, provide\r\nfurther examples of our commitment, which extends to all\r\nsectors of disarmament. How could it be otherwise, when\r\nsome countries consider it useful to put on an alarming\r\nshow of their nuclear expertise?\r\nA significant contribution to ethical renewal in\r\ninternational relations was the adoption, after much work,\r\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court. It is\r\nindeed shocking that those responsible for the most\r\nreprehensible crimes, in particular genocide, can go\r\nunpunished. Belgium has recently signed the Statute of\r\nthe International Criminal Court and intends to work for\r\nits effective establishment. My country will also continue\r\nto support the two existing United Nations ad hoc\r\ncriminal tribunals. Some countries still harbour doubts\r\nabout that important undertaking. However, a balance has\r\nbeen found between international security and justice. The\r\nonly remaining question is whether we, so-called civilized\r\nnations, are prepared to adopt binding rules so as to\r\nensure respect for the most elementary and universally\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\naccepted principles of respect for the human being and\r\ninternational coexistence. Adopting voluntary restrictions to\r\nstrengthen an international ethical code can only benefit\r\nStates and their citizens. That is truly the role of the State:\r\nto ensure that its citizens are protected — if necessary,\r\nthrough international law.\r\nI do not consider it realistic to develop a global ethical\r\ncode without working for the protection and education of\r\nour children. Working together with other countries, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other\r\nUnited Nations organizations, Belgium has played an\r\nimportant role in a number of initiatives. I propose that the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session build upon its\r\nachievements with respect to the definition of standards for\r\nthe protection of children. Child labour is a waste of human\r\nbeings — for the girls and boys who are subjected to it and\r\nfor future generations. Market forces must yield in this\r\narea. Like the enlistment of child soldiers, child labour is a\r\nmoral scandal that must be remedied through the\r\ndevelopment of alternatives adapted to the sociocultural\r\ncontext at the local level.\r\nOne of my Government’s priorities is the fight against\r\nthe most repugnant forms of exploitation. We are alarmed\r\nby the use of the Internet by those who traffic in children\r\nand by networks of prostitutes and all the new forms of\r\ncrime that make a mockery of traditional methods of\r\ndefending the rule of law. Here, too, international\r\ncooperation is the only solution.\r\nI am also ready to take the initiative, on the occasion\r\nof the tenth anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of\r\nthe Child in 1999, to organize, together with UNICEF and\r\nall interested countries, a meeting in Belgium at which we\r\ncan all share our experiences with regard to our respective\r\nlegislation.\r\nThe ideas that I have outlined will be not bear fruit if\r\nMember States do not cooperate fully with the\r\nOrganization. Denying the Secretary-General the resources\r\nneeded to turn the United Nations into an efficient\r\ninstrument will only make matters worse. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral deserves our full support in his reform efforts.\r\nThe Security Council is crucial for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Its reform is of concern to\r\nus all. I hope that in the not-too-distant future, a balanced\r\nenlargement of the Council can be agreed upon. The work\r\nundertaken during the past year has sometimes been\r\ndisappointing because of the stubborn resistance of several\r\ncountries. Belgium belongs to the majority of Member\r\nStates arguing for a strengthening of the authority of the\r\nCouncil. My country clearly laid out its position: we\r\nwould like an equal increase in the number of permanent\r\nand non-permanent members, better representation of the\r\nvarious regions and self-imposed limits on the use of the\r\nright of veto under certain conditions provided for in\r\nadvance. The privilege of veto is excessive when it is\r\nused to the detriment of the interests of the international\r\ncommunity as whole.\r\nThe consensus proposal put forward by the group of\r\n10 has numerous advantages and offers material for\r\nfurther reflection. It is quite disturbing to see that a\r\nminority of Member States are ignoring the evolution of\r\ninternational relations over the last 50 years while at the\r\nsame time claiming for themselves a preponderant role in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nPostponing reform of the Security Council is tantamount\r\nto an assault on its credibility.\r\nThe financial health of the Organization has not\r\nimproved much over the course of the last year. Belgium\r\nbelieves that countries that accumulate arrears harm the\r\nentire international community. The damage goes beyond\r\nthe resulting debt, because the Organization is denied the\r\nmeans fully to discharge its mandate. Furthermore, the\r\nreform process is jeopardized. Nothing can make up for\r\nthe damage this does to international cooperation and\r\nsocial progress. The political and moral responsibility of\r\nthose Governments is at stake. None who speak from this\r\nrostrum can claim their attachment to United Nations\r\nideals without accepting the financial obligations involved\r\nin being a Member, that is, payment in full, on time and\r\nwithout conditions of their financial contributions.\r\nIn face of the excesses of the international system,\r\nthe international community must be on guard. Here as\r\nwell our Organization can be the world’s conscience. Its\r\nweighty role is to help Member States formulate adequate\r\nresponses to the globalization with which we are\r\nconfronted. It is therefore in a serious yet hopeful frame\r\nof mind that I look at the agenda of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and pledge my country’s full support\r\nfor the work ahead of us.\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nFinland, Her Excellency Ms. Tarja Halonen, on whom I\r\nnow call.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nMs. Halonen (Finland): This year we are\r\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation\r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I should like\r\ntherefore to congratulate Mr. Opertti very warmly upon his\r\nelection to the presidency of this session. Finland will give\r\nhim its full support in his demanding task.\r\nFinland aligns itself with the statement made by my\r\nAustrian colleague, Mr. Wolfgang Schüssel, on behalf of\r\nthe European Union.\r\nAs has been mentioned in other statements, one of the\r\ncatchwords of our time is globalization. We all should be\r\nready to contribute to a constructive international dialogue\r\naiming at improving the joint global responses to the\r\nvarious challenges emanating from this globalization.\r\nWe have also done a lot. The United Nations has in\r\nthe 1990s convened global conferences to enhance\r\ndevelopment in the fields of human rights, sustainable\r\nenvironmental development, population policies, social\r\ndevelopment, the advancement of women, food security,\r\nhuman settlements and the rights of the child.\r\nThese conferences have set an ambitious global agenda\r\nto which Governments are committed. These commitments\r\nform a road map which guides the Governments, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and individuals as well as the\r\nUnited Nations system. The question remains: can the\r\nUnited Nations deliver? Do we, the Member States, want\r\nour Organization to be able to deliver? And do we make it\r\nour own responsibility to realize our commitments? Then\r\nand only then can the United Nations deliver.\r\nAnd are we also able to see good partners?\r\nDemocratic Member States and free, capable citizens and\r\ntheir organizations form a good basis for an international\r\nnetwork of safety in the world of globalization.\r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been\r\nand is the basis for developing human rights. We should\r\ncommemorate the Declaration in the daily activities of our\r\nGovernments and common international institutions.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has emphasized that human\r\nrights are the basis for sustainable human development and\r\nfor the sustainability of any community. I subscribe to his\r\nwords and endorse his objective of knitting human rights\r\ninto all United Nations activities. Adequate resources\r\nshould be secured for this process.\r\nThe universal nature of human rights should be\r\nbeyond question and doubt. All women, men and children\r\nwho enjoy or are demanding those rights are equal\r\nregardless of their nationality or cultural identity.\r\nThis year, human rights are being made more widely\r\nand better known because there are still women, men and\r\nchildren who are not aware of their rights. Yet\r\nconsciousness of one’s rights is the basis for the rule of\r\nlaw, democracy, good governance and full enjoyment of\r\nhuman rights. Awareness-raising is the key to concrete\r\nresults in the field of human rights.\r\nThe Criminal Court will become an effective\r\nmechanism for the trial of war criminals, as well as a real\r\ndeterrent against genocide, crimes against humanity and\r\nwar crimes. It is particularly important that the Court\r\nmake sure also that those individuals who are responsible\r\nfor atrocities in connection with internal conflicts will be\r\nbrought to justice.\r\nIt is important that special provisions for the\r\nprotection of women and children were included in the\r\ndefinition of war crimes and crimes against humanity as\r\nwell as elsewhere in the Statute. The Criminal Court\r\nshould keep this in mind in its everyday work. As the\r\nexperience of the two ad hoc tribunals shows, special\r\nexpertise is needed for that purpose.\r\nIn this connection, let me emphasize that Finland\r\nalso strongly supports the finalization of an optional\r\nprotocol on children in armed conflicts based on an age\r\nlimit of 18 years. The suffering inflicted on children by\r\nconflicts is intolerable. It is high time to act.\r\nWe have once again been reminded that terrorism\r\nconstitutes a growing threat to human beings, internal and\r\ninternational security and the functioning of democratic\r\ninstitutions. Within the framework of the United Nations,\r\nimportant work has been done in the fight against\r\nterrorism. A sustainable response to terrorism can be\r\nfound only through intensified efforts within the United\r\nNations and improved operational cooperation between\r\nStates. In this regard, I want to stress that the fight\r\nagainst terrorism should be carried out in accordance with\r\nrelevant international instruments, including those related\r\nto human rights.\r\nFinland calls for ratification and full implementation\r\nof the international conventions on the suppression of\r\nterrorism and an early finalization and acceptance of the\r\nconvention on the suppression of acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nAnother way to secure our global neighbourhood is to\r\ncontinue disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. The\r\nongoing efforts of the international community were\r\nchallenged by the nuclear test explosions by India and\r\nPakistan. Finland deplored these actions. Now it is\r\nimportant to prevent a nuclear arms race in South Asia. We\r\ncall on India and Pakistan to confirm their promises not to\r\ntest again through adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The CTBT remains a strong and\r\ndynamic cornerstone of the global security system. It serves\r\nthe interests of all States.\r\nFinland welcomes the agreement to begin negotiations\r\nat the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty banning the\r\nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons. A cap on\r\nthe production of fissile material will serve both nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nConventional weapons are increasingly included in\r\ndisarmament efforts. Finland warmly welcomes this\r\ndevelopment. In several conflict areas, the accumulation of\r\nweapons is threatening the very existence of nations. We\r\nwelcome the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention on\r\nanti-personnel landmines following the fortieth ratification\r\nlast week.\r\nThe issue of small arms is acute. Readily available and\r\neasy to use, small arms are the main tools of violence in\r\ntoday’s conflicts. The world community needs to respond\r\nto the problem of small arms through both enhanced global\r\nand regional cooperation. Member States need to control\r\ntheir exports and other transfers of small arms. But that is\r\nnot enough. An integrated approach involving measures\r\naddressing both security and development of societies is\r\nrequired. Finland supports a lead role for the United\r\nNations on the issue of small arms. We look forward to the\r\nrecommendations next year by the United Nations panel on\r\nsmall arms.\r\nOn the opening day of this session due tribute was\r\npaid to the women and men who have served during the\r\npast 50 years in United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe Organization has a unique role in peacekeeping.\r\nFinland reiterates its firm support and commitment to this\r\nessential function of the United Nations in global collective\r\nsecurity. The world needs the peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding capability of the United Nations. We have to\r\nstrengthen the capacity of the Organization in these fields.\r\nFinland calls upon Member States to secure financing for\r\nthis purpose.\r\nAttacks against unarmed United Nations personnel\r\nand humanitarian workers are increasing. This trend has\r\nto be reversed. Parties to any conflict must respect\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nWe have the global agenda, and the commitments\r\nare there. For implementation we need a strong United\r\nNations. The Secretary-General’s reform package must be\r\nimplemented without delay. The proposals for reform in\r\nthe economic and social sector need to be realized. It is\r\nalso high time to enter into real negotiations on the\r\nreform of the Security Council. All we need is political\r\nwill. The reform process must lead to a strengthened and\r\nmore efficient United Nations.\r\nFinland values the reforms undertaken by the\r\nSecretary General, Kofi Annan. We highly appreciate his\r\nleadership as the head of this Organization, and we\r\ncontinue to support him in his endeavours. Member States\r\nmust provide the United Nations with sufficient means.\r\nThey must fulfil their financial obligations towards the\r\nUnited Nations, in full, on time and without conditions.\r\nWithout a sound financial basis even the efforts at\r\nreforming the United Nations are bound to fail.\r\nFinland also calls for better cooperation and\r\ncoordination of development activities both within the\r\nUnited Nations system and between the United Nations\r\nand the Bretton Woods institutions. An efficient\r\nimplementation of the global agenda requires more\r\ncoherent approaches from the different actors in the field\r\nof development.\r\nToday’s global, regional and local problems have\r\ntheir economic, environmental and social dimensions. A\r\nlarge-scale problem of a developmental, ecological or\r\nhumanitarian nature may even turn into an armed conflict.\r\nIntertwined problems call for integrated responses. We\r\nhave good examples of integrated approaches in southern\r\nAfrica, as well as in Guatemala and in El Salvador. Peace\r\nagreements and operational agendas include agreements\r\non human rights, identity and the rights of indigenous\r\npeople, social and economic aspects and strengthening of\r\ncivilian power, as well as defining the role of the armed\r\nforces. Constitutional reforms and electoral regimes are\r\nalso essential, as is monitoring of the functioning of the\r\ncourts as a prerequisite for the reform of judicial systems.\r\nWe also see the importance of good governance.\r\nWe must secure the future of the United Nations, in\r\nterms not only of finance but of political support as well.\r\nHere Governments and the Organization can benefit from\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\npublic interest in the United Nations. We attach high\r\nexpectations to the Millennium Assembly and to the role\r\nand participation of civil society in the Millennium Forum.\r\nThe Forum can give us guidance from all sectors of our\r\nsocieties on which way to continue.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Russian):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia,\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab.\r\nMr. Gurirab (Namibia): Before I deliver my\r\nstatement, let me express on behalf of my country our\r\nheartfelt sympathy to the Governments and peoples of the\r\nCaribbean that have fallen victim to the devastating\r\nonslaught of Hurricane Georges. I hope that we all in the\r\ninternational community will extend to them comfort and\r\nhumanitarian assistance with all deliberate speed.\r\nLet me add my voice to the other speakers in\r\nfelicitating Mr. Opertti upon his unanimous election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.\r\nNamibia will readily lend him our full support and\r\ncooperation during his tenure of office. Our two\r\ncountries — Uruguay and Namibia — have worked very\r\nclosely together and with other friendly countries in\r\nbringing about the African-Latin American initiative, a\r\nnecessary and timely innovation aimed at concretizing a\r\nmutually felt need for greater interaction between our two\r\nneighbouring continents. I wish him all the luck.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to congratulate his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, former Foreign\r\nMinister of Ukraine, who so ably presided over the work of\r\nthe General Assembly during a period in which the\r\nOrganization took bold steps towards institutional\r\ntransformation and in various social and technical fields.\r\nNot only did he prove his leadership qualities and\r\ndiplomatic skills, but he also, and more importantly, sought\r\nto promote the important role of the General Assembly\r\nitself in the larger context of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, and particularly the\r\npreservation of human security. For small and developing\r\ncountries like Namibia, the Assembly is where democracy\r\ncomes alive as the world’s biggest parliament.\r\nTo the Secretary-General of our Organization,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, my delegation pledges its fullest support\r\nfor his tireless efforts to provide effective leadership and\r\npractical ideas as we try to find workable solutions to the\r\nnew challenges facing the global community. His annual\r\nreport and the important statement he delivered yesterday\r\nprovided inspiration and reassurance. I congratulate him\r\nfor his vision and initiatives.\r\nLet me say a word or two about the United Nations\r\nreform process. We are two years away from the new\r\nmillennium and, for some time now, we have all being\r\naddressing some of those challenges that lie ahead and\r\nhow the United Nations can transform itself to more\r\neffectively respond to the needs and aspirations of its\r\nMembers in the twenty-first century. The initial work of\r\nrevitalization of the United Nations in the economic,\r\nsocial and development fields has been partially\r\ncompleted. Reform of the United Nations is an ongoing\r\nprocess and Namibia believes that an important lesson can\r\nbe learnt from what has been achieved so far: no quick\r\nfixes, but also no indefinite negotiations. The management\r\nof the global economy is a top priority. Economic\r\ndisparities and social backlogs in our societies must be\r\nmitigated.\r\nAfrica’s position on the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil is on the table. It includes two permanent seats\r\non the Council and additional non-permanent seats.\r\nNamibia also calls for the abolition of the veto power.\r\nWe have done so before and I am repeating that call once\r\nagain, for the veto negates the very idea of United\r\nNations reform and democratization.\r\nLet me also say here that, while we take into\r\naccount the purposes of the United Nations as stated in\r\nArticle 1 of the Charter, it is also important that we take\r\neffective and collective measures to finance the United\r\nNations. In this regard, Namibia urges all Member States\r\nto pay their contributions in full and on time and to clear\r\ntheir arrears in order to enable the Secretary-General to\r\nfully carry out the resolutions of the General Assembly\r\nand, indeed, also those of the Security Council.\r\nI wish to say a word or two about peace and\r\ndevelopment. In 1995, all the world leaders who\r\nconverged on New York for the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the United Nations reiterated, in their\r\ndifferent languages yet in unison, their common\r\ncommitment to the highest virtues of human dignity,\r\npeace and security, sustainable development and\r\nprosperity for all. Three years later, it looks everywhere\r\nas if it is a question of business as usual. Much more\r\nneeds to be done in the areas of poverty eradication,\r\nhuman resource development and gender equality, as well\r\nas transfer of technology and resources for development\r\nfrom the rich to the poor.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nWherever in this, our one world, economic disparity,\r\nsocial injustice, armed conflicts, political instability and\r\nindeed environmental degradation prevail, there can be no\r\nrewarding human existence, meaningful productivity to\r\nsustain life and civilization, nor lasting scientific and\r\ntechnological breakthroughs in the service of this and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nToday’s very topical questions of democracy, human\r\nrights, good governance and globalization now seem to end\r\nup on the back burner of the global agenda. Other priorities\r\nalways seem to enjoy more attention. Much needed\r\nresources are being driven more and more away towards\r\ngreater benefits for the military-industrial enterprises of the\r\nrich and the powerful nations. The result is further\r\nimpoverishment of the nations and peoples of the third\r\nworld.\r\nHappily, we have been joined by two illustrious\r\nchampions in a worthy human cause: Danny Glover,\r\nAfrican-American actor activist, and Nadine Gordimer,\r\nSouth African Nobel laureate, who will, jointly and\r\nindividually, articulate worldwide the plight of the forgotten\r\nmasses in the third world, as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme’s Goodwill Ambassadors. Both of\r\nthem are my personal friends, and I congratulate them and\r\nheartily welcome them aboard.\r\nIt has been said by a third world leader that:\r\n“We live in an international jungle. There is no law\r\nand order in international relations. There is very little\r\njustice. The high and the mighty rule everywhere. The\r\nweak and the poor just have to lump it.”\r\nIt is hardly possible to dispute this.\r\nWith regard to issues of multilateral trade that are of\r\nconcern to the developing countries, there is an imperative\r\nneed for us to articulate a specific and constructive South\r\nagenda. The developing countries must develop a common\r\nposition on, for example, whether there should be a new\r\nround of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations or\r\nwhether a sectoral approach is preferable. These are our\r\ncommon concerns that the Group of 77 should be\r\nspearheading in WTO negotiations, as well as in the South-\r\nNorth dialogue.\r\nGlobalization is here to stay. We welcome it. But it is\r\nnot in itself a panacea for ensuring the people’s economic\r\nrights at home or a just world order, based on cooperation\r\nand equity. Globalization must be our thing collectively as\r\nmembers of the human family. When one section of the\r\nfamily prospers, the rest should be allowed to share in\r\nthat bonanza. To condemn a section of the family to a\r\nperpetual state of marginalization would be inhuman and\r\nunkind.\r\nThe heavy burden of external debt is denuding the\r\nresources and capacity of poor nations, mainly those in\r\nAfrica. External debt cannot merely be reorganized. Debt\r\nwrite-off is the best and the most humane thing to do,\r\nunder the present circumstances. Some major Western\r\ncreditors have written off debt, others should follow.\r\nBretton Woods institutions should rethink their insistence\r\non bleeding conditionalities in terms of official capital\r\nflows and debt relief in favour of providing assistance\r\ntowards stimulating economic growth and productivity\r\nthat will help poverty eradication in the developing\r\ncountries. In this connection, it is to be hoped that the\r\nrecent meeting held in New York with the World Bank\r\nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be a\r\nharbinger of new and better things to come.\r\nThe Group of 77, which is the task force for the\r\nmember States of the Non-Aligned Movement, together\r\nwith our many friends, must continue to work hard in\r\norder to hasten implementation of the Agenda 21\r\nProgramme of Action in its entirety. For globalization and\r\nliberalization to be carried out successfully in pursuit of\r\nour shared ideals of democratization, economic justice\r\nand human security, South-North dialogue should be open\r\nand constructive in the spirit of “smart” partnership,\r\ndevoid of confrontation and blackmail.\r\nAt the 1998 Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) Summit of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment, held at Grand Bay, Mauritius, on 13 and 14\r\nSeptember, the regional African leaders endorsed policy\r\nguidelines that will facilitate the speedy completion of\r\nSADC’s transformation into a dynamic development\r\ncommunity. This exercise will be carried out on the basis\r\nof the review and rationalization of the SADC Programme\r\nof Action. The Summit reaffirmed the ongoing work on\r\nsectoral coordination by member States to ensure\r\nstreamlining of sectors and increase regional integration\r\nand productivity. The member States were urged to\r\nexpedite ratification of the trade protocol as a matter of\r\nthe utmost priority. This will open up greater\r\nopportunities for regional economic cooperation and trade\r\nbetween them.\r\nAdded to these actions that have already been taken\r\nor are being envisaged was the strong reiteration that all\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nSADC regional policies and activities must be carried out\r\npursuant to the objectives and goals of the African\r\nEconomic Community. The first significant step taken in\r\nthis direction was the signing on 25 February 1998, in\r\nAddis Ababa, of the Protocol on The Relationship between\r\nthe African Economic Community and the Regional\r\nEconomic Communities. For 1999, the Summit set a theme\r\nfor SADC:\r\n“SADC in the next Millennium: The Challenges and\r\nOpportunities of Information Technology.”\r\nThat is the vision that seeks to promote the socio-economic\r\nempowerment of the people. Political and economic reforms\r\nthat have started in Africa must stay on course and produce\r\nthe results that our people want.\r\nRegarding regional conflicts, as other speakers have\r\nnoted, the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nis constantly being threatened by ongoing as well as new\r\nregional conflicts. Lately, dastardly acts of terrorism and\r\nindiscriminate counter-attacks have become frequent\r\nhappenings. In Europe, bloody confrontation and human\r\nsuffering persist in Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo. In West\r\nand South Asia, a very explosive political, military and\r\nnuclear situation is fast developing into an undeclared state\r\nof war and a likely destabilization of that strategic region.\r\nWe welcome the high-level and face-to-face meetings now\r\ntaking place between some of the leaders from that region.\r\nSadly, there is a serious situation of stalemate,\r\nreversals and prevarication in the Middle East, and the\r\npeace process has by now, to all intents and purposes,\r\nreached a precipitous dead end. Israel cannot hope to live\r\nin security if the universally accepted principle of land for\r\npeace is not scrupulously adhered to and implemented\r\nwithout delay. The legitimate rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople, including the right to self-determination and the\r\nestablishment of an independent State of their own, cannot\r\nbe sacrificed because of a single-minded insistence on\r\nsecurity. An early agreement on a just, comprehensive and\r\ndurable peace for the whole of the Middle East is the only\r\nviable guarantee for peace, stability, security and\r\ncooperation in the best interests of one and all. Namibia\r\nsupports that approach and not the politics of confrontation\r\nand nullification.\r\nIn our own SADC subregion, some of the old conflicts\r\nhave gone from bad to worse and new ones have been\r\nignited. In Angola, renewed military attacks and defiance of\r\nthe demands of the United Nations and the rest of the\r\ninternational community by Mr. Savimbi and UNITA have\r\nderailed the peace process and delayed the finalization of\r\nthe implementation of the remaining aspects of the 1994\r\nLusaka Protocol. The Security Council has reacted\r\nforcefully to UNITA’s non-compliance by imposing\r\nstringent sanctions on it and, once again, has demanded\r\nspeedy and full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol.\r\nFurthermore, the last summit of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), held in Ouagadougou, was equally\r\nunsparing in its condemnation of Mr. Savimbi and\r\nUNITA for unceasing delaying tactics and political\r\nviolence against innocent Angolans and the unsuspecting\r\ncitizens of neighbouring States, including my own\r\ncountry, Namibia. The recently concluded SADC Summit\r\nresolved, among other things, that measures must be taken\r\nto ensure compliance by Mr. Savimbi and UNITA with\r\nthe decisions that member States have made through\r\nSADC, the OAU and United Nations resolutions.\r\nThe Summit further called on the international\r\ncommunity, particularly countries and leaders who have\r\nan influence on Mr. Savimbi, to persuade the rebel\r\nmovement to rededicate itself to the path of peace and\r\nreconstruction in Angola, as a matter of urgency.\r\nOn another front, the Kingdom of Lesotho is once\r\nagain teetering on the brink of serious destabilization and\r\nsocial disorder just because some politicians, who were\r\ndefeated in the last general elections, have taken the law\r\ninto their own hands. It has become an acute situation,\r\nwhich our regional leaders are urgently and jointly trying\r\nto resolve peacefully.\r\nMoreover, other misguided men, driven by a blind\r\nambition and appetite for needless confrontation, have\r\nplunged the Democratic Republic of the Congo into a\r\ndevastating war, which has resulted in inter-African\r\nfighting on the battlefield of that sister country. Namibia\r\nhas joined the other SADC member States, at the express\r\ninvitation of President Laurent Kabila and his legitimate\r\nGovernment, for the sole purpose of preventing the\r\ncollapse of the State machinery and the violation of the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of a fellow SADC\r\nmember State by the invading armies and their\r\ncollaborators. Namibia’s involvement is for peace,\r\ndemocracy, human rights and regional cooperation.\r\nThe recent SADC Summit expressed itself on the\r\nsituation, and it is important that I quote a few passages\r\nwhat it said, as follows:\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\n“The Summit expressed deep regret at the outbreak of\r\nwar in DRC, as a result of attempts by rebels and\r\ntheir allies to forcefully remove the Government of\r\nPresident Kabila from power.\r\n“The Summit welcomed the initiatives by SADC and\r\nits member States intended to assist in the restoration\r\nof peace, security and stability in the DRC, in\r\nparticular the Victoria Falls and Pretoria initiatives. In\r\nthat regard, the Summit reaffirmed its call for an\r\nimmediate cessation of hostilities and commended the\r\nGovernments of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe for\r\ntimeously providing troops to assist the Government\r\nand people of the DRC to defeat the illegal attempt by\r\nrebels and their allies to capture the capital city,\r\nKinshasa, and other strategic areas. The Summit\r\nemphasized the need for all political actor in the DRC\r\nto commit themselves to orderly and peaceful\r\ntransition to multi-party democracy, primarily through\r\nconstructive consultations and negotiations involving\r\nall stakeholders.”\r\nAs freedom fighters, we never relied on ethnicity to\r\nwin victory against the oppressor nor can we ever accept\r\ntoday any idea of regional hegemony based on ethnicity and\r\nHerrenvolk tendencies from any quarter. African unity and\r\ncooperation must be based on a genuine spirit of solidarity\r\nand sharing, and not on subversion and disunity.\r\nThere are some outstanding questions that I would like\r\nto deal with now briefly.\r\nOur agenda still has on it the unfinished business of,\r\nfor example, decolonization, conflict resolution and\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nThe legitimate cause of the Palestinian people, led by\r\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization, and their full\r\nenjoyment of the right to self-determination, independence\r\nand sovereignty, cannot end with the creation of an\r\nAuthority which is only an interim mechanism. The goal\r\nwhich the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement and\r\ncertainly we in Namibia support, is that of unfettered\r\nstatehood as envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand international law. I say this simply to restate our well-\r\nknown position on the question of Palestine.\r\nCyprus, a fellow Member State of the United Nations\r\nand of the Commonwealth, is being bullied by a bigger and\r\npowerful neighbour which is perpetuating by means of fiat\r\nthe unlawful division of that peaceful island State. Namibia\r\nis aware of the repeated initiatives of the Secretary-General\r\nto end the deadlock; so far his efforts have been\r\nunsuccessful. The United Nations and the world\r\ncommunity must not forget the nation of Cyprus and its\r\nheroic people.\r\nAt last, there is a light at the end of the tunnel\r\nconcerning the resolution of the question of Western\r\nSahara. Following the Houston accords brokered by\r\nMr. James Baker, former United States Secretary of State,\r\nthere is now an agreement between the parties concerned\r\nfor a free and fair referendum to be held in December\r\nthis year. With this in mind, Namibia urges the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the United\r\nNations to ensure that the deadline is kept and that the\r\npeople themselves are given a genuine choice regarding\r\ntheir future. In this way, Africa’s last colonial question\r\nwill be finally resolved and the Kingdom of Morocco will\r\nreturn to the fold of the OAU, of which it is a proud\r\nfounding member. It will be a happy day for all Africans.\r\nNow that the question of East Timor has been put\r\nback on the front burner, Namibia lends its full support to\r\nthe latest steps that the Secretary-General has taken to\r\nfind an amicable and lasting solution, in cooperation with\r\nIndonesia, Portugal and the inhabitants of East Timor.\r\nWe apparently welcomed too hastily what we\r\nthought was good news concerning a peaceful settlement\r\nof the Lockerbie affair by the application of law. The\r\ngood news has all of a sudden been eclipsed by bad news\r\nor misunderstandings that need to be carefully sorted out\r\nin the spirit of give and take among the principal parties.\r\nThere are clearly serious legal and technical matters that\r\nrequire further consultations and clarifications between\r\nLibya, on the one hand, and the United Kingdom and the\r\nUnited States, on the other. Africa’s well-reasoned and\r\nconstructive position on this issue was reinforced at the\r\nlast OAU summit, held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.\r\nIn this connection, the decisions taken there are being\r\nimplemented by African leaders. Among them is a\r\nrenewed call for the Security Council to lift the punitive\r\nand outdated sanctions imposed on Libya several years\r\nago. The suffering of innocent people should quickly be\r\nbrought to an end.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to share a few personal\r\nthoughts. In his valedictory address to the General\r\nAssembly, President Mandela of South Africa referred to\r\nthe connections between the United Nations and South\r\nAfrica and invoked some memories of the past, beginning\r\nin 1946. Those memories and connections also included\r\nmy own country, Namibia, a former colony of apartheid\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nSouth Africa and a territory for which the United Nations\r\nassumed direct legal responsibility for 24 years, from 1966\r\nuntil 1990. That special linkage ended on 21 March 1990,\r\nthe glorious day of our independence. But the long-\r\nestablished relationship between the United Nations family\r\nand the Namibian people continues unabated.\r\nDuring the past more than 26 years of my active\r\ninvolvement in politics and diplomacy, I have known the\r\nUnited Nations system as my home. In various incarnations,\r\nI have walked the heights, the depths and the corridors of\r\nthis magnificent edifice of human brotherhood, liberation,\r\nequality and justice. Many mentors and friends from across\r\nthe globe have held my hand in support, encouragement\r\nand solidarity. They have contributed enormously to my\r\nformation and maturity.\r\nI did my undergraduate and postgraduate studies in\r\nthis country under a United Nations fellowship. On 25\r\nSeptember — that is, next Friday — I am going to receive\r\nan award from the World Association of Former United\r\nNations Interns and Fellows for, they tell me, an\r\n“outstanding contribution to the promotion of human\r\nrights, peace and development, especially within the\r\ncontext of promoting Namibia’s nation-building and\r\nthe role that United Nations training and other\r\neconomic and technical cooperation activities can still\r\nplay”.\r\nI am deeply touched by this generous gesture, and I\r\nam immensely grateful. This is the result of my partnership\r\nwith the United Nations and its varied agencies as well as\r\nwith friends the world over.\r\nI, actively supported by my Government, have\r\nannounced my candidature for the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth regular session, in\r\n1999. In this connection, I am most delighted to announce\r\nfrom this mighty rostrum that in June this year, in\r\nOuagadougou, Burkina Faso, the OAU Assembly of Heads\r\nof State and Government endorsed me as the sole African\r\ncandidate for the position. I trust that I can count on all the\r\nMember States from other regions to cast their votes in\r\nsupport of my candidature when the time comes. By doing\r\nso, you will have made me extremely happy. But, more\r\nthan that, you will have endorsed unanimously the\r\ncollective wish of the African continent.\r\nLastly, and in this context, I endorse the sentiments\r\nexpressed by our Secretary-General in respect of making\r\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, which falls\r\nin the year 2000, the Millennium Assembly. But I believe\r\nthe preparations must be made during the fifty-fourth\r\nsession, and Africa is ready to lead the way into the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Russian):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Mozambique, His Excellency\r\nMr. Leonardo Santos Simão.\r\nMr. Simão (Mozambique): At the outset, allow me\r\nto join the previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Opertti\r\nmost sincerely, on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-third session. His election is indeed\r\na recognition of his excellent qualities as an experienced\r\nand seasoned diplomat committed to the ideals of peace.\r\nAs I congratulate him today, I am reminded of the\r\nexcellent role played by Uruguay in assisting\r\nMozambique to consolidate peace and stability. On behalf\r\nof my Government, and on my own behalf, I wish to\r\nseize this opportunity to express our heartfelt tribute to\r\nthose young men who lost their lives in the search for\r\npeace in my country.\r\nLet me also pay well-deserved tribute for the\r\nexcellent manner in which his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko, discharged his duties as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its last session.\r\nI also wish to commend the Secretary-General for\r\nhis continued devotion to peace and development\r\nworldwide. His recent initiatives in this regard deserve\r\nmy Government’s full support, and we look forward to\r\ncontinuing to work closely with him.\r\nIn my last address to this body, one year ago, I\r\nspoke of positive changes which had taken place in my\r\ncountry. I am pleased to reconfirm today that the people\r\nof Mozambique remain firm in their determination to\r\nundertake bold steps aimed at ensuring and further\r\nstrengthening democracy, good governance and the rule\r\nof law. Within this context, the first municipal elections\r\nwere held in June this year, thus consolidating the process\r\ninitiated with the holding of the general elections four\r\nyears ago. Preparations are currently under way for the\r\nforthcoming general elections, scheduled for 1999.\r\nThe implementation of structural and economic\r\nreforms under the most severe circumstances over the last\r\n11 years should be seen within this perspective.\r\nMozambique is emerging step by step from the scourges\r\nof war and is gradually proving that, with hard work and\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nadequate international assistance, the country can and will\r\nbe a valuable partner in the international market place.\r\nWe believe that by concentrating on economic\r\nfundamentals — including low inflation rates, a stable\r\ncurrency and a transparent exchange-rate policy, stimulating\r\nprivate-sector growth and increasing foreign and domestic\r\ninvestment flows — our economy can achieve the desired\r\nresults. These measures have enabled Mozambique to\r\nachieve a growth of 14 per cent in its gross domestic\r\nproduct last year, compared to a real average growth of\r\nabout 6.6 per cent from 1991 to 1996. In addition,\r\nincreased agricultural production, coupled with the\r\nprivatization of over 900 Government-owned companies\r\nand the rehabilitation and restructuring of the main elements\r\nof infrastructure — such as roads, ports and railways —\r\nhave significantly contributed to raising productivity and\r\nhave played a critical role in achieving these encouraging\r\neconomic results.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on assistance to\r\nMozambique, which I highly commend, provides a further\r\naccount of the state of the Mozambican economy today.\r\nMoreover, the Governments of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) region, in close\r\ncooperation with the private sector, are taking aggressive\r\nsteps towards regional integration. These include, inter alia,\r\nthe launching of mega-projects, such as the Maputo\r\nDevelopment Corridor, a joint initiative by the\r\nGovernments of Mozambique and of South Africa; the $1.3\r\nbillion MOZAL aluminum smelter, recently announced by\r\nthe London Metals Exchange, a multi-partnership\r\ninvestment; and the Libombo Spatial Development\r\nInitiative, involving Mozambique, Swaziland and South\r\nAfrica.\r\nNotwithstanding these positive developments, we are\r\nstill faced with acute problems whose solution is vital if the\r\ncountry is to maintain the needed stability. The most critical\r\nof these, without a doubt, is the debt burden, which\r\ncontinues to be the single most significant impediment to\r\nnational development.\r\nMy Government welcomes the decision taken in April\r\nthis year by the World Bank and the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF) with regard to the eligibility of Mozambique to\r\ndebt relief within the framework of Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. We regard this Initiative\r\nas a recognition by the international community of my\r\nGovernment’s continued commitment to undertake sound\r\npolitical and economic reforms, and also of the suffering\r\nendured by our people throughout these years of the\r\nimplementation of such measures.\r\nWhile representing a significant step in the right\r\ndirection, the Initiative in its present form is not yet a\r\ndefinite solution to the debt problem. Further assistance\r\nby the international community, and the creditor\r\ncommunity in particular, is required. We need to ensure\r\nthe irreversibility of the positive developments, especially\r\ntaking into account that even with current relief measures,\r\npoor countries, particularly the least developed countries,\r\nremain poor. We would therefore encourage the creditor\r\nand donor communities to continue to review and\r\nconsider new relief measures, including the cancellation\r\nof official bilateral debt, in order to ensure that the\r\naffected countries can redirect their meagre resources to\r\nsocial programmes.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the eleventh meeting of the\r\nConsultative Group for Mozambique is taking place\r\ntomorrow in Maputo. The holding of this meeting on\r\nMozambican soil for the first time symbolizes the\r\ngrowing relationship between Mozambique and its\r\npartners, and my Government will do its utmost to ensure\r\na successful outcome of the proceedings with the creditor\r\ncommunity.\r\nMoreover, we are still confronted with the issue of\r\nthe prevailing threat of anti-personnel landmines, which\r\ncontinue to disrupt the very existence of nations and\r\npeoples. For this reason, my Government has signed and\r\nratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction. We did so as a\r\nrecognition of the imperative need to find durable\r\nsolutions to this issue. We warmly welcome the fortieth\r\nratification, by Burkina Faso, which will enable the\r\nConvention to enter into force, and we hope other\r\ncountries will do the same as soon as possible.\r\nIn this regard, my Government offered to host in\r\nMaputo next year the first meeting of States parties to the\r\nOttawa Convention, in accordance with article 11 of the\r\nConvention. It is our hope that the meeting will result in\r\nthe adoption of meaningful recommendations to address\r\nin a comprehensive manner the issue of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, particularly international cooperation and\r\nassistance and other relevant issues envisaged by this\r\nimportant instrument of international humanitarian law.\r\nWe are eager to welcome all of you to Maputo.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nLet me take this opportunity to express my\r\nGovernment’s deep gratitude and appreciation to the\r\npioneering role of Canada on this issue. It is my hope that\r\nall interested parties will take an active part in the\r\ndeliberations within the framework of the draft resolution\r\nto be presented in the First Committee.\r\nLast April, the Secretary-General presented his report\r\nto the Security Council on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica. We wish to commend him for his vision in\r\npreparing that report. The Secretary-General’s report\r\nrepresents a valuable contribution for a better understanding\r\nof African problems and offers concrete recommendations\r\nfor durable solutions by the international community. All\r\nefforts should be deployed to ensure that that report does\r\nnot follow the negative examples of other similarly\r\nimportant reports prepared by the United Nations before.\r\nI am particularly thankful for the recommendation that\r\neconomic sanctions should be better targeted in order to\r\nprevent the unnecessary suffering of innocent people, as we\r\nhave been witnessing over the years.\r\nThe concept of peace-friendly structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes should be fully implemented in order to\r\nminimize the negative consequences of such programmes\r\nfor the well-being of peoples. As outlined in these\r\nrecommendations: conditionalities should not be antithetical\r\nto peace processes; donors should not cut off funds from\r\nweak governments which, in good faith, are making\r\npopularly supported efforts to implement peace agreements;\r\naid should be focused on high-impact areas to reduce\r\ndependence; donors should strive to ensure that at least 50\r\nper cent of their aid to Africa is spent in Africa; and the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative\r\nshould be expanded to benefit more African countries.\r\nThese recommendations deserve our full support, and what\r\nis now required of us is to find the best ways and means of\r\nputting them into practice.\r\nI would also agree with the Secretary-General when he\r\nstresses that, without political will, Africa will remain\r\nbehind, with nothing to offer to future generations. For\r\nthese reasons, I wish to endorse the proposed holding of\r\nSecurity Council meetings at ministerial level on a biennial\r\nbasis to assess efforts undertaken and actions needed in this\r\nregard. Moreover, the convening of the Security Council at\r\nsummit level within five years to discuss the situation in\r\nAfrica could not be more timely. Indeed, it is high time for\r\nthe Council to devote the necessary attention to African\r\nproblems if the international community is to ensure a\r\nbetter future for the African continent.\r\nToday as yesterday, globalization is a matter of fact.\r\nHowever, we cannot afford to leave vast segments of\r\nnations and peoples unattended and still confronting basic\r\nchallenges such as famine, epidemic diseases and\r\ninadequate water distribution, among other challenges. As\r\nan African, I am certain that Africa is prepared to\r\nshoulder its responsibilities in this regard, so that together\r\nwe will be able to work towards a common goal.\r\nThe crisis which initially begun as an isolated case\r\nin the Asian economies has rapidly spread to virtually all\r\ncontinents. Its consequences have demonstrated that no\r\ncountry in this globalized economy is immune to the\r\nsuffering of other nations. Adequate solutions lie in\r\nsustainable development based on partnership in\r\ndevelopment cooperation. The persistence of extreme\r\npoverty in developing countries, particularly in the least\r\ndeveloped ones, will continue to represent a threat to the\r\neconomies of developed countries. The new vision which\r\nappears to emerge from the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nbringing together the United Nations and other partners in\r\nthe solution of social problems, will contribute to\r\naddressing major challenges facing our countries today.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to praise the\r\ntwo-day high-level meetings of the General Assembly\r\nheld a few days ago on renewal of the dialogue on\r\nstrengthening international cooperation for development\r\nthrough partnership and on the social and economic\r\nimpact of globalization and interdependence and their\r\npolicy implications. The meetings demonstrated the need\r\nto bring together governments, the private sector and\r\nother relevant segments of civil society in the search for\r\nsolutions to global problems.\r\nWe therefore hope that the ongoing reform of the\r\nUnited Nations will open new windows for the\r\nOrganization to strengthen its role and functions in the\r\npromotion of international cooperation for the social and\r\neconomic development of developing countries. As has\r\nbeen emphasized, the United Nations, by virtue of its\r\nuniversal membership, is the most credible instrument for\r\nperforming development tasks.\r\nRegional conflicts continue to be a major concern on\r\nthe agenda of the United Nations. Despite the recent\r\nsigning of understandings at Victoria Falls, the hostilities\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo continue\r\nunabated. We are deeply concerned by the course of\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\nevents, which threatens not only the territorial integrity of\r\nthat country but also peace and stability in the Great Lakes\r\nregion as a whole. We believe that with good will there can\r\nbe a solution addressing the concerns of all parties involved\r\nin this conflict. Neither Africa nor the international\r\ncommunity can afford to add a new chapter of conflicts of\r\nregional proportions, especially taking into account that\r\nvirtually all other long-standing conflicts in that continent\r\ncontinue to defy our collective imagination.\r\nWith respect to Angola, we are equally concerned with\r\ncontinued procrastination by Mr. Savimbi in the\r\nimplementation of undertakings within the framework of the\r\nLusaka Protocol and of relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. It is, indeed, the failure of União Nacional para\r\na Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to live up to its\r\nobligations which is leading the peace process in Angola to\r\nthe brink of collapse. Both the international community and\r\nthe parties concerned have an obligation to rescue the\r\nsuffering people of Angola from the prospect of yet another\r\nconflict of major proportions. The attainment of peace in\r\nAngola would undoubtedly contribute to bringing about\r\nneeded stability in the region.\r\nWe are fully associated with the progress made by the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and by the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States in the search\r\nfor the peace which has eluded Guinea-Bissau since the\r\noutbreak of hostilities in that country. These positive\r\ndevelopments underline the importance of political will by\r\nthe parties concerned, which should prevail in conflict\r\nsituations. My Government is also encouraged by the\r\ndevelopments concerning Western Sahara, and looks\r\nforward to the holding of the referendum in that Territory.\r\nIt is our hope that wisdom and statesmanship will\r\nprevail, and that peace and stability will ultimately become\r\na reality in Somalia, the Horn of Africa, the Sudan and\r\nother troubled regions of the African continent and beyond.\r\nWe are encouraged by the recent developments\r\nconcerning East Timor, as illustrated by the outcome of the\r\nmost recent meeting, held in New York, between the\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and of Portugal\r\nunder the auspices of the Secretary-General. We wish to\r\nencourage them to pursue further these efforts with a view\r\nto finding a lasting and internationally acceptable solution\r\nto this issue.\r\nMy Government has been following with keen interest\r\nthe latest developments in the Middle East. We have good\r\nreason to be disappointed by the course of events since the\r\nlast session of the General Assembly. Without a\r\ncomprehensive and just solution to the question of\r\nPalestine, which is the core of the conflict in the Middle\r\nEast, as well as respect for the legitimate interests of all\r\npeoples of the region, the prospects for a lasting peace\r\nremain in danger.\r\nIn addition, the latest developments concerning\r\nnuclear proliferation in South Asia have added new\r\nelements of destabilization to the already volatile\r\ninternational security environment. The new arms race in\r\nthat region constitutes a major setback in the international\r\nefforts aimed at ensuring peace, security and stability in\r\nthat region and in the world at large. Rather than\r\nproviding security guarantees for the countries concerned,\r\nthe new reality has in fact exacerbated the tensions in the\r\nregion.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place at\r\nan auspicious time for all the peoples of the world: 1998\r\nwill be recorded as the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Through concrete\r\nactions the international community must honour those\r\nwho have lost their lives in defence of human dignity\r\nduring the 50 years of the existence of the Universal\r\nDeclaration. Through concrete actions we must ensure\r\nthat the horrors and uncertainties of the past and the\r\ncontinued violations of fundamental human rights are not\r\nrepeated in the new millennium. We must devise\r\nappropriate strategies and find ways and means which\r\nwill enable future generations to live in harmony, peace\r\nand development, and which will prevent the recurrence\r\nof the abuses of human dignity that have been witnessed\r\nthroughout human history.\r\nIt is only through such actions that we can ensure\r\nthat the motto of “all human rights for all” is fully\r\nrealized. As the Secretary-General once reminded us,\r\nhuman rights belong to no Government and are limited to\r\nno continent, for they are fundamental to humankind\r\nitself.\r\nWe in Mozambique look forward to the celebrations\r\nas a source of momentum in educating ourselves about\r\nthe scope and magnitude of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, taking into account that the\r\npromotion and protection of these rights is essentially\r\neveryone’s responsibility. However, we recognize the\r\nprimary responsibility of the State in ensuring the\r\nenjoyment of human rights by our citizens. My\r\nGovernment underscores the need to assert the integrated,\r\ninterdependent and indivisible nature of all categories of\r\nrights, in which both political and civil rights, and\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 September 1998\r\neconomic, social and cultural rights, including the right to\r\ndevelopment, are treated equally. The programme we have\r\nprepared, which will culminate in a major celebration on 10\r\nDecember, is in conformity with these principles.\r\nThe establishment in Rome last July of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court represents a remarkable\r\ncontribution by mankind to the protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights all over the world. In Rome we created an\r\nunprecedented comprehensive legal framework to\r\nsafeguard human rights and bring to justice those\r\nresponsible for the most heinous crimes ever witnessed by\r\nhumanity, such as those committed in the recent cases of\r\nRwanda and of the former Yugoslavia.\r\nAlthough we would have liked a Court with more\r\nfar-reaching powers, we understand that the present\r\nstatute adopted in Rome represents a very delicate and\r\ndifficult compromise achieved through very long and\r\npainful negotiations. Efforts must be made to make\r\npossible the early entry into force of the statute of the\r\nCourt. We must also explore all possible avenues offered\r\nby the statute to improve the functioning and competence\r\nof the Court. That course of action would undoubtedly\r\nprovide better acceptance of the statute of the Court and\r\nwould ultimately ensure its universality.\r\nOur success in tackling the human rights issue,\r\nsustainable development and conflict resolution as well as\r\nin finding consensus on the major issues within the\r\nframework of the ongoing process of reform of our\r\nOrganization will greatly depend on the manner in which\r\nwe can accommodate our individual and collective\r\ninterests. Let us work together to ensure the attainment of\r\nthese objectives, and to enable the United Nations to fulfil\r\nits obligations as we enter the new millennium.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.20 p.m.\r\n35\r\n"
