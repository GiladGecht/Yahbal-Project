(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nHurricane in the Dominican Republic\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I wish\r\nto inform representatives that owing to reasons of force\r\nmajeure, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Dominican\r\nRepublic will speak today at the end of this afternoon’s\r\nmeeting, as his country has just been struck by a strong\r\nhurricane that has caused tremendous human and material\r\nlosses. The hurricane has also affected other countries of\r\nthe region, such as Haiti and possibly even Cuba. The\r\nreason for this schedule change is of a humanitarian nature\r\nand explains the situation as well as the Minister’s need to\r\nreturn to his country as soon as possible.\r\nI appeal to members for understanding in this respect,\r\nand I trust that we can express our solidarity in this way.\r\nWe will also be conveying, through the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Dominican Republic, our sympathy\r\nand our wish to cooperate with that country.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andrés Pastrana Arango, President of\r\nthe Republic of Colombia\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia.\r\nMr. Andrés Pastrana Arango, President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, His Excellency Mr. Andrés\r\nPastrana Arango, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Pastrana Arango (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Mr. President, as I address the Assembly for the\r\nfirst time as President of Colombia, I should like to offer\r\nyou, on behalf of my Government, our warmest\r\ncongratulations on being elected to guide our debates\r\nduring this session.\r\nA few weeks ago, the most important democratic\r\nelections in Colombia’s recent history took place. Despite\r\nthe problems that have besieged our nation in the last few\r\nyears, our institutional structure has faced one of the\r\nsternest tests ever and has again shown that it is solid. In\r\nJune, more than 12 million people — one of the highest\r\nelectoral turnouts in the history of the Republic —\r\nexpressed their free, spontaneous and conscious choice.\r\nToday, Colombia is looking towards new horizons.\r\nWe have restored confidence in our country. We have\r\nstarted the changes which will enable us to face our\r\ninternal problems with determination and which will win\r\nus a more positive and dynamic place in the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nOur most urgent task will be to build for peace. That\r\nis the unshakable commitment of my Government and the\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nheartfelt desire of all of the Colombian people. We are\r\naware that any process designed to root out the causes of\r\nconflict for all time will be highly complex. But all our\r\nefforts will be dedicated to this noble goal, and we will\r\nstrive for it tirelessly.\r\nIt is for this reason that I have personally taken the\r\nlead in building peace. We are working hard on the\r\npreparation of an agenda for this purpose. We are\r\nconvinced that representatives of all sectors of society\r\nshould play a part, and that at the end of the road we will\r\nfind a guiding light that will lead our country again to\r\npeaceful coexistence. Peace in Colombia will also be\r\nfounded on a clear strategy for economic development and\r\na bold policy for social justice. Only in this way will it be\r\npossible to forge a fruitful and lasting peace.\r\nAs we travel the road to peace the support of the\r\ninternational community will complement our own efforts.\r\nWe will advocate respect for fundamental rights and\r\nfull application of international humanitarian law among all\r\nthose involved in conflict. We will learn from the valuable\r\nexperiences of other countries in the solution of internal\r\nconflicts, and we will adopt whatever is applicable and\r\nappropriate to our own situation.\r\nPeace in Colombia will demand very substantial\r\ninvestments in social sectors and infrastructure in the zones\r\nof conflict. For this, we will create a “Peace Fund”. A\r\nsignificant portion of the money required will come from\r\ninternal sources. We will also be looking for contributions\r\nfrom the international community, from which we have\r\nalready received expressions of encouragement, solidarity\r\nand interest.\r\nAll these actions will be part of what we have termed\r\n“diplomacy for peace”. It will be diplomacy with social and\r\neconomic content. It will be diplomacy expressed in\r\ninvestment and in the mobilization of human, technical and\r\nfinancial resources, so that our peace will have a firm and\r\nlasting foundation.\r\nThe achievement of peace in Colombia will be an\r\nimportant initial contribution to the liberation of mankind\r\nfrom one of the twentieth century’s greatest evils: the\r\nglobal problem of illicit drugs. To the extent that we can\r\nfind agricultural alternatives for our peasant farmers, with\r\nfair prices for their products at home and abroad, they will\r\nbecome less dependent on illicit crops. The support of the\r\ninternational community will be crucial in this. The\r\neradication of illicit crops will be one of the central\r\nelements of the peace talks that we intend to undertake\r\nwith the groups engaged in armed conflict.\r\nIt is true that the end of East-West confrontation\r\nbrought into being a system of international relations\r\nbased on détente and on a decline in the role that military\r\npower had played during the cold war. The spectre of a\r\nnuclear cataclysm seemed to have vanished, and all\r\nhumanity embraced new hopes for the future.\r\nIt was thought that the end of the cold war would be\r\nthe salvation of the many countries and the millions of\r\npeople who had been forgotten in the midst of tensions\r\nand feuds between the two superpowers. But now, almost\r\n10 years later, those initial expectations are far from\r\nbecoming a reality. Ethnic and religious rivalries, regional\r\nconfrontations and grave new threats to peace have\r\nemerged.\r\nI must say most clearly that my Government and the\r\npeople of Colombia absolutely reject all kinds and modes\r\nof terrorism, whatever their origin or motive. There can\r\nbe no truce with terrorism. All States must fight together\r\nto defeat it. This is surely one of our greatest challenges.\r\nCorruption is buffeting democracy in a growing\r\nnumber of countries and is becoming a cause of political\r\nand social breakdown. Illicit drugs continue to be one of\r\nthe worst scourges of today’s society, bringing irreparable\r\nharm to the new generations and, therefore, to the future\r\nof humanity.\r\nHuman rights are still not properly respected.\r\nWomen are still the target of abuse and discrimination.\r\nChildren are the victims of disgraceful practices. Fifty\r\nyears after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, the more vulnerable groups often have no\r\naccess to the protection that States are obliged to provide\r\nfor them.\r\nUnsustainable consumer and production practices\r\nstill continue. The planet’s natural resources are being\r\ndepleted, its biological wealth is being looted, and our\r\nrivers and oceans are being contaminated. Poverty\r\ncontinues to affect huge segments of society. Economic\r\ngrowth in some countries and the prosperity of some\r\nlevels of society contrast dramatically with the\r\nmarginalization suffered by the majority of the world’s\r\npopulation.\r\nThis situation is occurring in an international\r\nenvironment in which the right to development is\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nindissolubly linked to the existence of a favourable\r\ninternational climate. We are going through the most\r\nserious financial crisis since the end of the cold war, but\r\nthere does not yet seem to be sufficient clarity and political\r\nwill to face it and overcome it.\r\nAll Latin America has voiced its concern at the gravity\r\nof the crisis. Its origins are outside our region, in which\r\ncountries have made structural reforms to achieve healthy\r\neconomies that will enable them to meet the social\r\nexpectations of their peoples.\r\nWe are aware of the risk of a world recession, and we\r\nconsider it essential that the more developed countries, the\r\nGroup of Seven and the international financial organs adopt\r\nsuitable measures to prevent any new collapse. Such a\r\ndisaster would irreversibly affect the developing countries\r\nfirst. The measures should enable the financial markets to\r\nrecover their stability and provide a rapid solution to the\r\ncurrent crisis in the world economy that has caused so\r\nmuch concern.\r\nAmong the proposals which Colombia made at the San\r\nFrancisco Conference and which were included in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, there are two I would now like to\r\nmention, because they belong to the common heritage of\r\nour foreign policy: first, compliance in good faith with the\r\nobligations assumed by the Member States of the United\r\nNations, as an underlying assumption for the validity of its\r\nuniversal action; and secondly, recognition of the role\r\nplayed by regional arrangements and agencies in the\r\nmaintenance of peace, in international security as an\r\nintegrated concept and in the peaceful settlement of disputes\r\nbetween States.\r\nColombia believes that universalism and regionalism\r\nare complementary and should support each other\r\nharmoniously. Therefore, one of the aims of our diplomacy\r\nis to strengthen the regional agencies within the concept of\r\nuniversalism. It is thus essential that we join our efforts to\r\nregain the momentum achieved on the occasion of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations, so\r\nthat the Organization will be revitalized and ready for the\r\nbeginning of a new millennium.\r\nThe various levels of action required are all based on\r\nthe credibility of the multilateralism which the United\r\nNations embodies and the trust which our peoples have in\r\nit. Some support the approval of certain reforms that the\r\nexperience of this period of history and the changes on the\r\nworld scene have in themselves made imperative. The\r\nUnited Nations cannot be expected to possess magic\r\nformulas that we ourselves do not have for solving\r\nproblems and situations that concern us all, within the\r\ncontext of the interdependence and internationalization\r\ncharacteristic of our times. But we certainly need to adapt\r\nthem to this moment in history, when we face such wide\r\nhorizons and colossal challenges. We need something of\r\nthe idealism and pragmatic spirit which could be inspired\r\nby solidarity among the human race.\r\nThe reasons for the creation of the United Nations\r\nnot only remain intact, but also have rapidly even become\r\nmore relevant in the second half of the twentieth century.\r\nThe principles which inspired its creation have become so\r\nimportant that any action taken unilaterally or by a group\r\nof States turns out to be inadequate or limited in effect.\r\nTherefore, it will be useful to identify what we can do to\r\nmake the proposed reforms truly worthwhile. One must\r\nseek a genuine consensus for the agenda of priorities for\r\nthe new millennium.\r\nColombia is ready to help reconcile existing\r\ndisputes. This is not a question of a simple, formal\r\nagreement or of a quest for utopian reform, but of a\r\nmeeting of wills and a methodical and open-minded\r\nconsensus regarding proposals which are designed to\r\nbring us closer to an era of greater justice and balance.\r\nWe must eliminate the contradiction in which more\r\nresponsibilities, actions and programmes are demanded\r\nfrom the United Nations while at the same time some\r\nStates fail to meet their obligations or do not show any\r\nwillingness to increase their contribution in proportion to\r\ntheir capacity. Without doubt, the United Nations must be\r\nproperly funded. The adaptation of structures, regulations\r\nand modes of operation means that the Organization must\r\nhave the personnel and the funds it needs, through\r\nefficient and exemplary management.\r\nCooperation for development must receive a massive\r\ninjection to save it from decline, and this must be in\r\naccordance with the text and spirit of the Charter and of\r\ncountless commitments, within an overall concept that\r\nincludes encouragement of respect for human, individual,\r\nsocial, economic and cultural rights.\r\nMy Government has a policy of encouraging broader\r\nparticipation by the new actors on the international stage,\r\nsuch as non-governmental organizations and the private\r\nsector. New sources of funding for certain social,\r\ndevelopment and humanitarian programmes should be\r\nsought, which should extend the scope of action of the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nUnited Nations and ensure that it continues to steer the\r\ncommon course of international solidarity.\r\nWe need multilateralism with social content, in which\r\nthe human being is the central priority and in which\r\ndevelopment is the guiding principle in decisions. I stand\r\nbefore you to appeal to all nations to contribute to the\r\nburial of the post-cold-war period, to see it as no more than\r\nan interregnum, and to open the door wide to an era of\r\ncreative and more humane multilateralism.\r\nThe original principles of the Organization are of\r\ncourse still valid, but we need to make some adjustments.\r\nWe need to reconsider certain modes of international action\r\nand heed the voices of the peoples who desire development\r\nand fight for it in the midst of difficulty and conflict. We\r\nneed to strengthen communication and dialogue between\r\nNorth and South and to correct unreasonable imbalances.\r\nWe believe that the time has come to make an\r\nobjective review of the present state of negotiations for the\r\nreform of the Organization, in order to ensure that social\r\nand economic matters are properly related to the legitimate\r\naspirations of developing nations. There must be\r\ninstruments to encourage rapport between the organs\r\noriginating from the San Francisco Charter and those\r\ninstitutions born at Bretton Woods.\r\nWe know that the responses of individual nations or\r\ngroups of States are insufficient. Therefore, there is an even\r\nmore urgent need to coordinate global responses through\r\nvigorous multilateralism. There is an obvious dichotomy\r\nbetween de facto globalization, science and technology,\r\ninstantaneous communications and the world market, on the\r\none hand, and, on the hand, the absence of genuine social\r\norder and human advancement.\r\nWe must revive an authentic and productive North-\r\nSouth dialogue, based on a concept of solidarity which is\r\nmore substantial than declarations or good intentions and\r\nwhich is expressed in specific action. It must take account\r\nof the needs of the more vulnerable groups and of those\r\nexcluded from progress. It must replace the logic of\r\nconfrontation and of the division between poor and rich\r\ncountries with the logic of cooperation, shared\r\nresponsibility and solidarity inspired by justice as the\r\ngolden rule of multilateralism.\r\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II summed up this\r\nposition perfectly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the United Nations, when, addressing this same\r\nAssembly, he urged us to unite our efforts to build a\r\ncivilization of love, founded on the universal values of\r\npeace, solidarity, justice and liberty, to overcome the fear\r\nwhich darkens human existence at the end of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\nWe firmly believe that the Charter and all the\r\ninstitutions of the international system must promote\r\ndynamic cooperation, each enriching the shared universal\r\nheritage with its own particular character.\r\nThe United Nations must not be merely a forum for\r\nthe sovereign expression of States. It must be the place\r\nfor negotiation and synthesis in the political, cultural,\r\nsocial and economic life of the nations.\r\nIt is reassuring to see that the grand designs that\r\ninspired the Charter remain valid. It is now our task to\r\nmaintain them and to interpret the new situations that\r\narise in the course of history.\r\nWe know, for example, that conflicts within States\r\nare conceptually different from the old wars between\r\nStates. We have a greater understanding of the link\r\nbetween peace and development and of the way in which\r\npolitics and socioeconomic interests are related. We\r\nbelieve that it is appropriate to consolidate a minimum\r\ninternational order and to replace violence and terrorism\r\nwith peace and coexistence, which should then thrive\r\nnaturally through multilateralism.\r\nColombia encourages the efforts undertaken in arms\r\ncontrol, with the systematic quest for disarmament as the\r\nultimate goal, and supports the priority allocation of world\r\nand regional resources to development. We believe that it\r\nis therefore essential to make progress in the control and\r\ngradual elimination of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nto exercise effective control over the illegal arms trade, to\r\nwhich thousands of men, women and children fall victim\r\ndaily throughout the world, and especially in the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe need a realistic and methodical strategy to secure\r\npeace in our time and in the coming century. We need to\r\npromote monitoring mechanisms for treaty compliance,\r\nthe negotiated solution of conflicts and the creation of\r\nnuclear-free zones with effective verification systems. In\r\nthis respect, the United Nations will need to perfect early-\r\nwarning systems to evaluate events so that its actions will\r\nbe efficient and genuinely preventive.\r\nI have come here today to reaffirm Colombia’s\r\nunbroken tradition as a nation devoted to the great\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nprinciples that underpin the very existence of the United\r\nNations. We are prepared to offer, with thoughtful\r\noptimism, our support for the achievement of its purposes\r\nand its reforms. We believe it would be useful to review\r\nand appraise the results of the various summits held in\r\nrecent years, so that we may follow up their results and\r\nplans of action. This will serve both as a gauge of their\r\neffectiveness and as the central element of the analysis of\r\nthe coordination of the various institutions of the United\r\nNations system as a whole.\r\nOur people rightly demand more effective action and\r\nless empty rhetoric. We cannot betray billions of human\r\nbeings who yearn for a world at peace, with democracy and\r\nfreedom, and above all just, united and equitable.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Andrés Pastrana Arango, President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jules Wijdenbosch, President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname.\r\nMr. Jules Wijdenbosch, President of the Republic of\r\nSuriname, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Suriname, His Excellency Mr. Jules\r\nWijdenbosch, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Wijdenbosch: Before starting my\r\nstatement, I should like to express, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation, our sympathy to the victims and their families\r\nin the path of the destructive Hurricane Georges through the\r\ncountries of our region, including Caribbean sister nations.\r\nI call upon the United Nations and its humanitarian\r\nagencies to render all possible support to the countries and\r\nthe peoples afflicted.\r\nAllow me to extend my congratulations to you,\r\nMr. President, on your election to preside over our\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. I would also like to\r\nexpress my appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for\r\nhis important contribution during the last session.\r\nIn addition, may I also thank the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his continuous efforts to transform\r\nour United Nations into a more effective instrument for\r\npromoting peace and enhancing the well-being of the\r\npeople of the world as we move into a new millennium.\r\nMrs. Osode (Liberia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe restructuring of the Security Council with a\r\nview to properly reflecting the present international\r\neconomic and political reality and to meeting the new\r\nchallenges of the next millennium is of fundamental\r\nimportance. My delegation believes that the discussions\r\nshould not be limited to the mere expansion of the\r\nCouncil, but should rather address the improvement of its\r\neffectiveness and its adherence to the principle of our\r\nCharter that all States are equal. We would like to\r\nemphasize that my delegation fully underscores the\r\nposition taken by the Non-Aligned Movement, most\r\nrecently at its twelfth summit meeting in Durban, South\r\nAfrica.\r\nSuriname is pleased with the call by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for greater cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations in preventing conflicts.\r\nIn the western hemisphere, it is mainly the Organization\r\nof American States and the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) which have often demonstrated their\r\ncapabilities of overcoming seemingly insurmountable\r\nhurdles by preventing or ending conflicts between and\r\nwithin member States.\r\nAllow me to raise some matters of equally serious\r\ninternational concern that require urgent attention. A\r\ndisturbing and despicable phenomenon, which we all must\r\ncondemn in the strongest terms, is the senseless attacks\r\non and even killing of international civil servants,\r\nincluding United Nations field officers. Since these heroic\r\nmen and women are contributing to the cause of\r\nhumanity, crimes committed against them must be treated\r\nas crimes against humanity and punished accordingly.\r\nRecent terrorist attacks in Africa, Europe and elsewhere\r\nhave once more shocked the international community and\r\nhave left us in a state of dismay.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nThe Republic of Suriname condemns international\r\nterrorism and welcomes the conclusion of regional\r\nagreements and mutually agreed declarations to combat and\r\neliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nMy Government deeply deplores the fact that the\r\nprocess for durable peace and reconciliation in the Middle\r\nEast has again been stalled and the current situation\r\ncontinues the great suffering of the Palestinian people and\r\nuncertainty for the people of Israel. We call upon all sides\r\nto re-establish mutual confidence and call on the\r\ninternational community to exert every influence on the\r\nparties concerned to save the peace process.\r\nIt is recognized that the phenomenon of globalization\r\npresents a challenge for the Caribbean region, and requires\r\nfundamental changes in our economies and in the\r\ndevelopmental process of the region, while increasing the\r\nrisk of marginalization for all vulnerable economies.\r\nIn this regard, we share the view that the small\r\nCaribbean States should be granted a reasonable period for\r\nadjustment to the changing international environment, in\r\norder to enable us to improve our competitiveness, and a\r\nnon-reciprocal preferential system must be maintained\r\nduring that transition period. This will allow for a more\r\nrealistic transition, which will eventually facilitate better\r\nadaptation of our economies.\r\nMore than ever, the interdependence of States has\r\nbecome clear, now that the negative consequences of\r\nglobalization have recently manifested themselves in a\r\ndramatic manner for many of our member States. I\r\ntherefore make an urgent appeal to all responsible actors\r\ninvolved in the world economy, including the international\r\nfinancial institutions and monetary authorities, to adjust\r\ntheir relevant policies so as to redress the structural,\r\nfinancial and economic imbalances and adverse effects that\r\nhave risen.\r\nWe call upon all nuclear-weapon States to accede to\r\nand fully implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty. We are convinced that the new Department for\r\nDisarmament and Arms Regulation will bolster the capacity\r\nof the United Nations to pursue these objectives, bearing in\r\nmind the ruling by the International Court of Justice in July\r\n1996 that the use of, or the threat to use, nuclear weapons\r\nis contrary to international humanitarian law.\r\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, Suriname wishes\r\nto reiterate its commitment to these rights. At the same\r\ntime, my Government holds the view that it is equally\r\nimportant not to focus our attention solely on the\r\nfulfilment of civil and political rights; we should also\r\nfocus on the fulfilment of the social and economic rights\r\nof our peoples.\r\nIt is in this respect that Suriname believes that the\r\nimplementation of the “Right of Development”, in\r\nparticular for peoples in the developing world, must be\r\ngiven equal attention by the international community.\r\nWhat should be stressed in this context is that human\r\nrights and sustainable human development are\r\ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing. The promotion\r\nof human rights is, indeed, of particular relevance in a\r\nglobalized world, with its potential to marginalize the\r\nweak and small States, particularly those with limited\r\nresources.\r\nSuriname takes part in the General Assembly debate\r\nwith a sense of pride, since it has demonstrated to the\r\nworld its acceptance of responsibility for the protection of\r\nthe environment by preserving one of the most pristine\r\nforests on this globe for conservation purposes. My\r\ncountry has recently created the Central Suriname Nature\r\nReserve, comprising 1.6 million hectares and 12 per cent\r\nof the territory of the Republic of Suriname. This nature\r\nreserve, one of the largest nature reserves in South\r\nAmerica and possibly the single most pristine tropical\r\narea on Earth, is our gift to humankind for eternity. I\r\nconsider this gift a special contribution to, among other\r\nthings, the safeguarding of one of the fundamental human\r\nrights of the world population, namely, the right to life.\r\nWe hope that other nations will follow this example and\r\ncommit themselves to the protection of the forests of our\r\nworld.\r\nThe information superhighway facilitates the\r\nexchange of information and can also contribute to the\r\ndevelopment and the promotion of public awareness\r\nworldwide. However, I must also express my sincere\r\nconcern about the possible negative consequences of the\r\nmisuse of this form of technology, which could have\r\nadverse effects on all strata of our communities, including\r\nour youth. It deserves serious consideration to develop\r\nand implement legislative measures to prevent any form\r\nof misuse of this form of technology, without in any\r\nrespect jeopardizing the fundamental right of free\r\nexpression.\r\nAs a result of the twentieth special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, devoted to the world drug problem,\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nSuriname is now in the final stage of organizing a\r\nsubregional conference on the drug problem, the aim of\r\nwhich is to establish a plan of action in cooperation with\r\nGuyana, Venezuela, Brazil and France, in order to\r\neffectively combat this form of organized crime.\r\nFinally, I am pleased to conclude that since our last\r\nAssembly reform of our Organization has been well on its\r\nway, with a renewed emphasis on economic, social and\r\ndevelopment activities, and the need to implement its\r\nmission of peace, development and human rights in a more\r\neffective manner.\r\nWe must continue to revitalize the United Nations,\r\nsince it is our universal instrument for concerted action in\r\nthe pursuit of our noble aim of the betterment of\r\nhumankind. It bears repeating, again and again, that the\r\nmajority of the key conflicts in the world, and the threats\r\nto the world community, can only be solved or averted\r\nthrough the strengthening of our multilateral mechanism.\r\nThe United Nations must be that mechanism. Our\r\ncombined political will should be its new life; a new life\r\nfor the challenges of the new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Suriname for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jules Wijdenbosch, President of the Republic of\r\nSuriname, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Mr. Navinchandra\r\nRamgoolam, Prime Minster of the Republic of\r\nMauritius\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\na statement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius.\r\nThe Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Mauritius, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius,\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Navinchandra\r\nRamgoolam, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Ramgoolam (Mauritius): Our presence here\r\ntoday is, for my delegation and my country, cause for\r\nsome celebration. This is the thirtieth anniversary of our\r\nfirst participation in the General Assembly. Upon the\r\nattainment of our independence in 1968, the father of the\r\nnation, the then Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagur\r\nRamgoolam, addressed the United Nations.\r\nI join the speakers before me in congratulating\r\nMr. Opertti on his assumption of the office of President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.\r\nI would also like to thank his predecessor,\r\nMr. Udovenko, for the manner in which he conducted the\r\nwork of the previous session.\r\nI wish to commend our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his wise leadership and vision, which have\r\nbeen a source of renewed confidence in the future of this\r\nOrganization. We welcome his efforts to lead a reformed\r\nand more effective United Nations into the twenty-first\r\ncentury to better carry out our mission of peace,\r\ndevelopment and human rights. We wish to assure him of\r\nour total support in the continuation of the reform\r\nprocess.\r\nWe are alive to the intense debate on the reform of\r\nthe Security Council. We reiterate our position that the\r\nSecurity Council should be enlarged and made more\r\ndemocratic and representative. In this respect, we reaffirm\r\nour commitment to the stand taken by the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement at the recent Summit in Durban.\r\nIn recent years the world has been profoundly\r\ntransformed by the powerful forces of globalization and\r\nliberalization.\r\nAll countries are now inextricably linked as\r\ndistances between them become increasingly immaterial\r\nthrough great leaps in information technology and\r\ncommunications.\r\nThe tremors triggered by the crises of the South-East\r\nAsian economies and, more recently, the turmoil in the\r\nworld financial markets have shown in a dramatic way\r\nthe dangers of the contagion effect. Even those countries\r\nwhich are trying to be efficient and competitive face the\r\npossibility of external shocks because of the volatility of\r\ncapital markets.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nI believe that the world community should devise\r\ncreative and effective mechanisms to prevent emerging\r\neconomies which have put in hard work from losing the\r\nfruits of liberalization.\r\nWe must not go back to the inward-looking strategies\r\nof the 1960s. We must continue to open our economies, but\r\nwith greater caution.\r\nThis is a great challenge for a large majority of\r\nnations, particularly the least developed ones. We know\r\nonly too well that a number of developing countries are\r\namong the most vulnerable and are not yet ready to\r\nintegrate into the global economy.\r\nWhen I last addressed this Assembly, I dwelled at\r\nsome length on the generally grim situation in Africa,\r\nwhich remains one of the most intractable challenges to the\r\nworld community. It is a continent rich in natural resources\r\nand yet afflicted by widespread poverty.\r\nPeace and development in Africa have been, for more\r\nthan a decade, the subject of endless debates and\r\nresolutions at the United Nations. But we know that\r\nsustainable development in Africa is conditional upon the\r\nachievement of a strife-free continent. It is sad indeed that\r\nyear after year the number of potential flashpoints seems to\r\ngrow more numerous. The situation in many regions of\r\nAfrica remains a cause for great concern.\r\nThe peoples of the continent can ill afford the\r\npointless strife and violence visited upon them at a time\r\nwhen the priorities should be economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe in Africa naturally have to bear the primary\r\nresponsibility for assuring lasting peace for our peoples.\r\nThis is precisely what the leaders of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) are striving to achieve.\r\nIn his statement to this Assembly, on Monday,\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela, current Chairman of SADC,\r\nmentioned the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo. This difficult problem figured prominently on\r\nthe agenda of the summit which Mauritius hosted a few\r\ndays ago, after it was addressed earlier by the Victoria Falls\r\nmeeting and the Pretoria special SADC summit.\r\nI wish to renew here our appeal to all parties involved\r\nin this conflict to solve their differences peacefully through\r\npolitical dialogue and diplomacy. In the Indian Ocean\r\nregion to our immediate southwest, Mauritius is\r\nparticipating fully in the efforts of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and of the countries of that region\r\nto seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis facing the\r\nComoros on account of separatist activities by a group on\r\nthe island of Anjouan. Mauritius fully supports the unity\r\nand territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros.\r\nFortunately, however, all is not gloom when we\r\nsurvey Africa. We note with satisfaction the continuous\r\npositive economic growth that most sub-Saharan countries\r\nhave enjoyed lately.\r\nI had the privilege to participate in a round table\r\ntogether with the Deputy President of South Africa earlier\r\nthis year, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, on the\r\nnew competitive Africa. The consensus was that Africa\r\nstands at the threshold of a new era — an era of\r\nopportunity and dynamism. We are at the dawn of an\r\nAfrican renaissance.\r\nGovernments in Africa are becoming increasingly\r\ndemocratic and responsive, putting more emphasis on\r\neconomic development, greater openness, market-oriented\r\npolicies and greater economic reform.\r\nRegional cooperation is another positive feature of\r\nthe new Africa, working through groupings such as\r\nSADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern\r\nAfrica (COMESA) and the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) to facilitate cross-border\r\ntrade leading to the ultimate establishment of an African\r\nEconomic Community.\r\nBut for Africa to realize its full potential, several\r\nserious constraints will have to be overcome.\r\nThe international economic environment should be\r\nmade less hostile to Africa. Africa’s shares of world trade\r\nand foreign direct investment still remain at a paltry level.\r\nThe debt burden has become in itself a crippling\r\nfactor and needs urgently to be alleviated.\r\nWe also cannot sufficiently emphasize the\r\nimportance of official development assistance in this\r\nregard. We therefore deeply deplore the decline in the\r\nlevels of official development assistance among the major\r\ndonor countries. Today, they stand at a historical low. We\r\nare now, more than ever, far off the target of 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross national product recommended by this Assembly.\r\nThis trend must be reversed.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nMauritius took the initiative recently of highlighting\r\nthe specificities of small island economies in the context of\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) and the negotiations\r\nof a successor agreement to the Lomé IV Convention. As\r\na result, recent ministerial declarations adopted by both the\r\nWTO and the OAU now contain explicit references to small\r\neconomies and their high vulnerability. This reality is now\r\ngaining recognition within the Bretton Woods institution.\r\nFor the reasons I have just mentioned, small\r\neconomies require time and space to adjust to the new\r\nworld trade order. We therefore reiterate the need for the\r\nmaintenance of non-reciprocal trade regimes until such a\r\ntime as we are adequately prepared.\r\nThe Lomé Convention is a model of North-South\r\ncooperation. The proposed United States African Growth\r\nand Opportunity Act could become another. Together with\r\nthe other members of the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern\r\nand Southern Africa (COMESA), we would like to reaffirm\r\nour total support for its passage.\r\nMauritius has always accorded the highest priority to\r\nregionalization to break out of its insularity and enlarge its\r\neconomic base. Mauritius was a major player in launching,\r\n15 years ago, the Indian Ocean Commission and, more\r\nrecently, the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional\r\nCooperation.\r\nThe Assembly will appreciate that an island State like\r\nMauritius would be interested in the protection of the\r\nmarine environment. We recommend for the particular\r\nattention of the General Assembly the report of the\r\nIndependent World Commission on the Oceans, according\r\nto which the very survival of the human race over the long\r\nterm is jeopardized by the abuses to which the world’s\r\noceans are subjected.\r\nWe have to address as a matter of priority the three\r\nmost immediate dangers identified by the Commission: the\r\noverexploitation of marine biological resources, the\r\ndumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global\r\nwarming. While much has been achieved since the Rio\r\nEarth Summit, we deplore the fact that the initial\r\nmomentum and urgency appear to have been lost in sterile\r\nand fractious debate. I urge that we address these questions,\r\non which our very survival depends, with renewed\r\nearnestness and a greater sense of shared responsibility.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn December we will celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the adoption and proclamation by this\r\nAssembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nFor us, that will also provide an opportunity to recall\r\nanother milestone in the history of human rights: the\r\nadoption by the French Constituent Assembly of the\r\ndeclaration of the rights of man and of the citizen more\r\nthan two centuries ago.\r\nAt this historic moment, we wish to recall the\r\npreamble of the Charter of our Organization, which\r\nproclaims our\r\n“faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity\r\nand worth of the human person, in the equal rights\r\nof men and women and of nations large and small”.\r\nWe also reaffirm our profound belief in the equality\r\nof all rights — social, economic and cultural, as well as\r\ncivil and political. Today, Governments can no longer\r\nflout the rights of their citizens without being subjected to\r\nthe censure of the international community. Yet millions\r\nof inhabitants of many parts of the world remain deprived\r\nof their fundamental rights by oppressors and tyrants who\r\ngovern by force. We have observed with horror the\r\natrocious crimes against the dignity and worth of the\r\nhuman being committed during recent conflicts. My\r\nGovernment therefore welcomes the recent adoption in\r\nRome of the Statute of the International Criminal Court.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nMy Government believes that respect for human\r\nrights is but one facet of the indispensable foundation of\r\nthe harmonious development of a country. Democracy\r\nand transparent and accountable government, as well as\r\neffective participation by civil society, are the other\r\nessential ingredients for successful development.\r\nConsidering the complex sociocultural and ethnic mix of\r\nour population, we have taken great care to ensure that all\r\nour citizens, regardless of their origins or gender, have\r\nequal access to education, adequate health care, proper\r\nhousing and employment opportunities. We will soon\r\nintroduce in our own National Assembly a protection of\r\nhuman rights bill, which will provide for the\r\nestablishment of a National Human Rights Commission.\r\nAt the continental African level, participants at the\r\nThird Conference of African Women Parliamentarians,\r\nwhich Mauritius was privileged to host, adopted the Port\r\nLouis Declaration, calling for increased political\r\ncommitment at all levels for the promotion of gender\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nequality and the empowerment of women. We in Mauritius\r\nare taking legislative measures to translate our commitment\r\ninto practical reality.\r\nWe have now become even more aware of the need to\r\nseek global solutions to our common problems. Climate\r\nchange, illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism are problems\r\nwhich require a coordinated international approach. No\r\nnation can live under a dome, with its climate isolated from\r\nthe rest of the world. No country can on its own fight\r\ninternational drug traffickers or terrorism. We therefore\r\ncondemn unequivocally all forms of terrorism and call for\r\nenhanced international cooperation to combat and prevent\r\nits occurrence.\r\nWhile social, economic and trade matters are\r\nincreasingly — and with good reason — occupying centre\r\nstage in international forums, crucial problems of security\r\nand disarmament continue to retain their capacity to derail\r\nour efforts for development.\r\nEarlier this year we were reminded of the dangers for\r\nhumanity of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the\r\nattendant risks of a new arms race. No country can feel\r\ngenuinely secure as long as the threat of nuclear weapons\r\nexists from any quarter. In this respect, we welcome the\r\nstand taken by both India and Pakistan in exercising self-\r\nrestraint. We reiterate our position that any international\r\ninstrument for the elimination of nuclear arsenals should be\r\nnon-discriminatory in nature. Security for all will be\r\nachieved only when that threat is completely eliminated.\r\nGlobal nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of all\r\nweapons of mass destruction must remain our ultimate goal.\r\nFinally, as on past occasions, we would like to bring\r\nup once more before this Assembly our lasting claim on the\r\nsovereignty of two territories which were taken from our\r\npatrimony: the island of Tromelin and the Chagos\r\narchipelago. We reiterate our call to the former colonial\r\nPowers to enter into constructive bilateral dialogue with my\r\nGovernment for the early restoration of those territories to\r\nthe sovereignty of Mauritius.\r\nRegarding the Chagos archipelago, this Assembly\r\nshould also be reminded that some 1,500 inhabitants — the\r\nso-called “Illois” — were coerced to leave their homeland\r\nto clear the way for a military base. Most of the families,\r\nwho had lived for generations on these islands, were moved\r\nto the main island of Mauritius, victims of the then\r\nprevailing cold war. Today, after more than 30 years, they\r\nstill experience tremendous difficulties adapting to their\r\npresent conditions. Many yearn to be resettled on these\r\nislands. As we are about to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of this century’s seminal document on human\r\nrights, we consider that we owe it to these Illois to fully\r\nre-establish their rights, including the right of return.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius for the statements he has just\r\nmade.\r\nThe Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Mauritius, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of China, His Excellency\r\nMr. Tang Jiaxuan, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Tang Jiaxuan (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): I wish to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits current session. I believe that his wisdom and\r\nexperience will enable him to accomplish his important\r\nmission with distinction.\r\nI would also like to express my appreciation for the\r\ncontribution made by Mr. Udovenko as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly during the previous session.\r\nAt present, the international situation is undergoing\r\nprofound changes. The accelerated trend towards\r\nmultipolarity has injected new vitality into international\r\nrelations. Economic globalization is developing very\r\nquickly, and countries are becoming increasingly\r\ninterdependent. The development of multipolarity and\r\nglobalization has provided a stimulus to the readjustment\r\nof international relations.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nBilateral partnerships, mainly characterized by non-\r\nconfrontation, non-alignment and non-targeting against\r\nthird countries, have been established one after another.\r\nVarious regional and intercontinental organizations of\r\ncooperation have become more active than ever before.\r\nSuch endeavours to seek the establishment of stable,\r\npragmatic and balanced international relations contribute\r\nto peace and development as well as to the establishment\r\nof a fair and equitable new international political and\r\neconomic order.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nHowever, we cannot lose sight of the many\r\nuncertainties still existing in the world.\r\nThe nuclear arms race is a product of the cold war. In\r\nthe post-cold-war period of today, the people of all\r\ncountries call fervently for the prevention of nuclear\r\nproliferation and endeavours for nuclear disarmament.\r\nIt is to be regretted that last May India conducted\r\nnuclear tests, going against the tide of the times, thus\r\nadversely affecting peace and stability in South Asia.\r\nSoon afterwards, Pakistan, too, conducted nuclear\r\ntests. Their nuclear tests not only led to an escalation of the\r\ntension between the two countries, but also dealt a heavy\r\nblow to international nuclear disarmament and the\r\nmechanism for the prevention of nuclear proliferation. This\r\nhas aroused the great concern of the international\r\ncommunity. We hope that India and Pakistan will fully\r\nimplement the Joint Communiqué of the five permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, as well as the provisions\r\nof Security Council resolution 1172 (1998), give up their\r\nplans to develop nuclear weapons and immediately and\r\nunconditionally accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We appeal to India and\r\nPakistan to resolve the dispute over the issue of Kashmir\r\nthrough peaceful means.\r\nIn our view, following the nuclear tests in South Asia,\r\nthe international community faces the pressing task of\r\nconsolidating and strengthening the international non-\r\nproliferation mechanism to prevent further proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons and enhance the universality and authority\r\nof the NPT.\r\nChina has all along stood for the complete prohibition\r\nand thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Back in 1994,\r\nthe Chinese Government proposed to the General Assembly\r\nthat a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons\r\nshould be concluded through negotiations. Furthermore, the\r\nChinese Government has on many occasions called on all\r\nthe other nuclear States to undertake not to use or threaten\r\nto use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States and\r\nnuclear-free zones, has proposed the conclusion of a\r\nconvention on no first use of nuclear weapons through\r\nnegotiations and has called for the early negotiation of a\r\nfissile material cut-off treaty. China was active in the\r\nnegotiations on the CTBT and was among the first to sign\r\nthe Treaty. Today, I would like to reiterate on behalf of the\r\nChinese Government that China will abide by the\r\nprovisions of the Treaty and has no intention of resuming\r\nnuclear testing. China will continue to pursue the policies\r\nof unconditional no first use of nuclear weapons and\r\nunconditional no use or threat of use of nuclear weapons\r\nagainst non-nuclear States and nuclear-free zones and will\r\ncontinue to support the Conference on Disarmament in\r\nGeneva to negotiate and conclude a non-discriminatory\r\nand verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty on the basis\r\nof the agreed mandate. China urges the countries with the\r\nlargest nuclear arsenals to accelerate their nuclear\r\ndisarmament process. As to the question of the ultimate\r\ncomplete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear\r\nweapons, China, as a nuclear State, will never shirk its\r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe East Asian financial crisis that broke out in July\r\n1997 has caused a sharp decline in the economies of\r\nmany countries of the region. Its negative impact is still\r\nspreading. The drastic devaluation of the Japanese yen\r\nsince last June has added to the difficulty of economic\r\nrecovery in the region.\r\nThe crisis occurred in the overall context of\r\neconomic globalization, and its impact is being felt across\r\nthe world. Stepping up international cooperation and\r\nputting an early end to this crisis is not only in the\r\nimmediate interests of the East Asian countries, but also\r\nin the interests of the international community as a whole,\r\nand especially of the developed countries. We hope that\r\nthose developed countries with important influence on the\r\nregion’s economy will shoulder their responsibilities and\r\ntake active, resolute and effective measures to make their\r\ndue contributions to safeguarding the stability of the\r\nfinancial order and promoting the recovery and\r\ndevelopment of the region’s economy.\r\nFollowing the eruption of the East Asian financial\r\ncrisis, the Chinese Government has taken a highly\r\nresponsible attitude. China has rendered assistance to the\r\ncountries concerned within the framework arranged by\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and, at the same time,\r\nthrough bilateral channels. Proceeding from the overall\r\ninterests of maintaining the stability and development of\r\nthe region, China has made the decision not to devalue\r\nthe yuan renminbi, for which we have endured great\r\npressure and paid a heavy price. Now, despite the\r\ngrowing pressure and risk facing us, our decision to\r\nmaintain the stability of the yuan renminbi will remain\r\nunchanged.\r\nFighting with one heart and one mind, we won the\r\nbattle against the disastrous floods. We have taken a\r\nseries of measures to deepen our reform and expand\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\ndomestic demand so as to ensure the sustained growth of\r\nour economy and achieve the objective of an 8 per cent rise\r\nin this year’s gross domestic product. We firmly believe\r\nthat with the common efforts of the countries in the region\r\nand of the rest of the international community, the East\r\nAsian economy will be able to gradually get out of its\r\npredicament and return to the road of sound development.\r\nThe Middle East peace process has been in a stalemate\r\nfor some time, which has aroused widespread concern in\r\nthe international community. We are of the view that the\r\nArab nations and Israel should hold earnest and pragmatic\r\nnegotiations so as to achieve a comprehensive, just and\r\nlasting peace, which will be not only in the fundamental\r\ninterests of the Arab and Israeli peoples, but also conducive\r\nto world peace and stability. We hope that all the parties\r\nconcerned in the Arab-Israeli disputes will take a flexible\r\nand pragmatic position to promote steady progress in the\r\npeace negotiations under the principle of land for peace and\r\non the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and\r\nthe agreements already reached. The Chinese Government\r\nwill, as always, support the Middle East peace process and\r\nthe efforts made by the United Nations and the relevant\r\nparties to this end.\r\nWe are following the developments in the Kosovo\r\nregion of Yugoslavia with concern. It is our hope that the\r\nparties involved will solve the problem through political\r\ndialogue. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nYugoslavia should be respected. Peace and stability in the\r\nBalkans have been hard won and should be cherished all\r\nthe more by the relevant parties and by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe border conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea and\r\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are\r\nanother source of concern for us. It is hoped that they will\r\nbe appropriately resolved by the parties involved through\r\npeaceful means.\r\nThe twenty-first century is greeting us. On the\r\nthreshold of the new century, the United Nations bears\r\nheavy responsibilities with regard to maintaining world\r\npeace, promoting human progress and establishing a just\r\nand rational new international political and economic order.\r\nIt has an irreplaceable role to play. Above all, after the end\r\nof the cold war, the United Nations, with fewer constraints\r\nand more vitality, is confronted with unprecedented\r\nopportunities. In this context, the United Nations should and\r\ncan use its own advantages to play a unique and\r\nconstructive role in building a peaceful, secure and stable\r\nworld, in establishing a new type of international\r\nrelationship based on friendship and cooperation and in\r\ntaking up the common challenges facing mankind.\r\nChina has consistently held that it is necessary to\r\ncarry out appropriate reform in the United Nations so that\r\nthe Organization can better keep abreast of the changing\r\nsituation and serve its numerous Member States. We have\r\ntaken note of the initial progress of United Nations reform\r\nin a number of fields promoted by all Member States.\r\nSome reform measures and recommendations proposed by\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, have been\r\napproved by the General Assembly and are now being put\r\ninto practice. Intense discussions on reform of the\r\nSecurity Council are also in orderly progress. At present,\r\nthere are still differences among Member States on quite\r\na few issues involved in the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We hope that all parties will adopt a constructive\r\napproach and play an active part in the relevant\r\nconsultations with a view to reaching a proper settlement\r\nof relevant issues.\r\nHere, I wish to reiterate the basic position of the\r\nChinese Government on these issues. First, the reform of\r\nthe Security Council bears on the interests of all countries\r\nand so requires a democratic style of work and extensive\r\nand full consultations. All Member States should have an\r\nequal right to speak on the question of the reform, and\r\ntheir reasonable proposals should be fully reflected.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council is not a club of rich\r\ncountries. The purpose of its reform is not just to meet\r\nthe concerns of a few big countries. Rather, more\r\nattention should be given to the interests and aspirations\r\nof the vast number of developing countries.\r\nRepresentation should be balanced between the developed\r\nand the developing countries.\r\nThirdly, the reform measures are of major\r\nsignificance, as they bear on enhancing the role of the\r\nSecurity Council in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. They should be worked out on the basis of the\r\nrealities and in the light of history. It is a matter of course\r\nthat the objective of the reform of the Security Council is\r\nto solve problems rather than to create new sources of\r\ndiscord. In order to ensure that the reformed Security\r\nCouncil gains extensive support from Member States, it\r\nis essential to adhere to the principle of consensus.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nIn the past 50 years, the Declaration has vigorously\r\npromoted the advancement and development of the cause\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nof human rights in the world. Vast numbers of people in\r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America freed themselves from\r\ncolonial rule. The South African people rooted out the dark\r\nsystem of apartheid, won basic political rights and became\r\nan equal member of the international community. The\r\nUnited Nations, for its part, adopted a series of international\r\ninstruments on human rights such as the Declaration on the\r\nRight to Development, further enriching the content of\r\nhuman rights. The right to development has been\r\nuniversally recognized in the international community as an\r\ninseparable part of basic human rights.\r\nIn the meantime, earth-shaking changes have taken\r\nplace in China. Especially in the past two decades, since the\r\nintroduction of reform and opening up, China has witnessed\r\nan ever-improved practice of democracy, an ever-improved\r\nlegal system and ever-enhanced legal protection of the\r\nrights of its people. It is perfectly obvious that the Chinese\r\npeople now enjoy a higher degree of freedom and equality\r\nthan ever before and a much fuller and more settled life\r\nthan in the past. The Chinese Government will continue to\r\nmake unremitting efforts to advance democracy and to\r\nstrengthen the legal system, while developing the economy\r\nso as to better ensure that its people enjoy human rights to\r\nthe full.\r\nThe Chinese Government is active in supporting and\r\nparticipating in the activities of the United Nations in the\r\nfield of human rights. China has all along stood for\r\ninternational cooperation in the field of human rights on the\r\nbasis of equality and mutual respect, so as to enhance\r\nunderstanding, narrow differences, expand common ground\r\nand strengthen cooperation through dialogue. The Chinese\r\nGovernment is ready to engage in dialogue, exchanges and\r\ncooperation, on the basis of equality and mutual respect,\r\nwith human rights organizations at the national and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nLast October, the Chinese Government signed the\r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural\r\nRights. As to the International Covenant on Civil and\r\nPolitical Rights, I earnestly declare here that the Chinese\r\nGovernment has decided to sign it early next month. This\r\nonce again testifies to the resolve of the Chinese\r\nGovernment with respect to promoting and protecting\r\nhuman rights. China is ready to continue to work with other\r\ncountries to maintain and increase the current positive\r\nmomentum of dialogue and cooperation so as to promote\r\nthe furtherance of the world cause of human rights.\r\nThis year is the twentieth anniversary of the\r\nintroduction of the policy of reform and opening up in\r\nChina. In these two decades, China has scored\r\ntremendous achievements in its reform, opening up and\r\nmodernization drive. Particularly in recent years, our\r\nnational economy has gained a favourable momentum of\r\nhigh growth and low inflation, thanks to deepened\r\nreforms and strengthened macroeconomic regulation. Last\r\nSeptember, the Communist Party of China, at its fifteenth\r\nNational Congress, formulated a blueprint for China’s\r\ncross-century development based on the new\r\ndevelopments both on the domestic and international\r\nscene. In March this year, our new State institutions and\r\nnew Government were formed through elections at the\r\nfirst session of the ninth National People’s Congress of\r\nChina. We will build energetically on our political and\r\neconomic restructuring and carry forward the cause of\r\nbuilding socialism with Chinese characteristics into the\r\ntwenty-first century in a comprehensive way.\r\nChina’s modernization drive requires a stable\r\ninternational environment of peace. China will continue to\r\npursue its independent foreign policy of peace. This\r\npolicy is sustained by three pillars: to persist in\r\nindependence and maintain the initiative, to safeguard\r\nworld peace, and to seek common development.\r\nTo persist in independence and maintain the\r\ninitiative, we always put our State sovereignty and\r\nnational security first and never develop relations with\r\nother countries at the expense of our own sovereignty.\r\nTaiwan is an inalienable part of China’s sacred\r\nterritory. The successful return of Hong Kong and the\r\nupcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly provide\r\nuseful inspiration and create favourable conditions for the\r\nsettlement of the Taiwan question. We will, as always,\r\nadhere to the basic policy of peaceful reunification and\r\none country/two systems; adhere to President Jiang\r\nZemin’s eight-point proposal on developing cross-Strait\r\nrelations and promoting the process of peaceful\r\nreunification of the motherland; expand cross-Strait\r\nexchanges and cooperation in various fields; and\r\nresolutely oppose the creation of the “independence of\r\nTaiwan”, “two Chinas” and “one China/one, Taiwan” and\r\nTaiwan’s attempt to re-enter the United Nations.\r\nWe respect the sovereignty of other countries and\r\nvigorously support the efforts of all countries in the\r\nworld, and of developing countries in particular, to defend\r\ntheir State sovereignty, while firmly safeguarding our\r\nown. In handling international relations, we adhere to\r\nnon-alignment, non-confrontation and the non-targeting of\r\nThird States. We do not go in for military blocs and the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\narms race, nor do we engage in military expansion. China’s\r\ndevelopment will not pose a threat to any other country.\r\nThe so-called “China threat” is entirely unfounded and\r\nfabricated with ulterior motives.\r\nTo safeguard world peace, China is a staunch force for\r\nthe maintenance of world peace and regional stability. It is\r\nour consistent view that State-to-State relations should be\r\nhandled in a spirit of mutual respect and peaceful\r\ncoexistence, transcending differences in social systems and\r\nideologies. Countries should safeguard their own interests\r\nand, at the same time, respect those of others and\r\ncontinuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation by\r\nseeking the convergent points of common interests. With\r\nregard to existing differences and disputes, it is necessary\r\nto persist in dialogue, not engage in confrontation, and\r\nstrive to settle them by peaceful means rather than by\r\nresorting to force or the threat of force.\r\nIt is essential to completely reject the mentality of the\r\ncold war, advocate a new security concept and resolve\r\ninternational and regional security issues through consensus\r\nand participation on an equal footing. We in China stand\r\nfor the equality of all countries, big or small, and for\r\naccelerated democratization of international relations. World\r\naffairs should be handled through consultation by all\r\ncountries, and no country should impose its own will on\r\nothers.\r\nTo seek common development, peace is the\r\nprerequisite of development and development is the basis of\r\npeace. In today’s world, where the economy is increasingly\r\nglobalized, countries must pursue an open policy in order\r\nto achieve economic growth. Opening up to the outside\r\nworld is China’s long-standing basic State policy. As a\r\nhuge emerging market, China will strive to keep abreast of\r\nthe trend of economic globalization and be even more\r\nactive in opening up to the world. It is ready to develop\r\ntrade and expand scientific and technological exchanges\r\nwith all countries on the basis of equality and mutual\r\nbenefit and in the interest of common progress. It attaches\r\nimportance to and actively participates in the activities of\r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)\r\nand the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and sets store by the\r\nestablishment and development of friendly exchanges and\r\ncooperation with other global and intercontinental or\r\nregional organizations for economic cooperation.\r\nChina continues to take a positive attitude towards\r\njoining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Thanks to\r\nunremitting efforts over a decade, China is already qualified\r\nfor entry. Regrettably, however, the relevant negotiations\r\nhave dragged on and on with no decision having been\r\nmade. China is a developing country, and we can\r\nnegotiate China’s entry into the WTO only on this basis,\r\nin accordance with the principle of balancing rights and\r\nobligations. It is our hope that the countries concerned\r\nwill take a practical, fair and flexible attitude, give up\r\nexcessive demands and work for an early conclusion of\r\nthe relevant negotiations. China’s joining the WTO will\r\nbenefit all its members and make the multilateral trade\r\nmechanism complete and more balanced.\r\nBefore I conclude my speech, please allow me to\r\nuse the forum of the United Nations to brief you on\r\nChina’s flood-fighting and disaster-relief efforts. Owing\r\nto such factors as abnormal climate changes this year,\r\ncatastrophic floods swept along the Yangtze, Nenjiang,\r\nSonghua and other rivers of China. The sheer size of the\r\nsubmerged regions, the duration of the floods and the\r\nseriousness of the disaster they caused were something\r\nrarely seen before. Giving top priority to the protection of\r\npeople’s lives and their safety, the Chinese Government\r\nmobilized forces from all sectors across the country and\r\norganized millions of soldiers and civilians for an all-out\r\nbattle against the floods and for disaster relief. Thus, the\r\nassaults of flood crests were repelled again and again; the\r\nsafety of the main dykes, the main transport arteries and\r\nmajor cities along the rivers was ensured; and the loss of\r\nlife and property was kept to a minimum.\r\nAt present, the Chinese Government is sparing no\r\neffort to resettle the people affected by the flood and has\r\nstarted reconstruction projects in the disaster areas. We\r\nare taking every measure possible, with full confidence,\r\nto ensure that there will be no famine and no widespread\r\nepidemic diseases in the wake of the natural disaster and\r\nthat none of the pupils or students in the flood-hit areas\r\nwill drop out from school or be deprived of education. In\r\nthe course of reconstruction, we will carry forward the\r\ngreat flood-fighting spirit in an all-round endeavour to\r\npush forward our reform and opening up and the socialist\r\nmodernization drive.\r\nSince China was hit by the disastrous floods, a\r\nnumber of countries and international organizations and\r\ncommunities have sent messages to express sympathy and\r\nsolicitude, and rendered support and assistance to China.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the\r\nChinese Government and people, our most sincere\r\ngratitude to them.\r\nThe world of today is a world of interdependence.\r\nThe promotion of peace, cooperation and development has\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nbecome the main trend of the times. Let us join hands and\r\nwork together to bring into the twenty-first century a world\r\nof peace, security and stability in the interest of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Hubert Védrine, to whom I give the floor.\r\nMr. Védrine (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President,\r\non your election, which attests to the high regard in which\r\nthe international community holds you and your country,\r\nand which France, as an old and true friend of Uruguay,\r\nwelcomes. We hope that the work of the fifty-third session\r\nof the General Assembly will, under your presidency, lead\r\nto the strengthening of the Organization.\r\nIt was 53 years ago in San Francisco that we, “the\r\npeoples of the United Nations”, decided to join our efforts\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person...to\r\nestablish conditions under which justice...can be\r\nmaintained, and to promote social progress”.\r\nThat immense ambition was justified by the recent\r\nhorrors, which at all costs were to be prevented from\r\nhappening again — a necessary utopia, perhaps, or a\r\nsuperhuman task. But as the great French writer Albert\r\nCamus put it:\r\n”Superhuman tasks are the ones man takes a long time\r\nto accomplish, that’s all.”\r\nA long time has elapsed, and we are still working on\r\nthat, still toiling. We have no reason to be ashamed of what\r\nwe have done as the United Nations throughout these 53\r\nyears, of what the Security Council and successive General\r\nAssemblies have done, as well as seven Secretaries-\r\nGeneral — in particular the current one over the last two\r\nyears, whose work has been so outstanding.\r\nOver the decades, the Security Council, except when\r\nparalysed by abuse of the veto, has almost always managed\r\nto shoulder its primary responsibility for international\r\nsecurity. When it failed to do so, no other institution was\r\nable to in its stead. Since its first peacekeeping operation 50\r\nyears ago, the Security Council has launched 49 operations\r\nof this kind.\r\nThe institutional framework established by the\r\nCharter has, in the most varied situations, ranging from\r\ncold war confrontation to the cooperation of recent years,\r\nproved its irreplaceable usefulness. This again was borne\r\nout in the spring of this year during the Iraqi crisis, when\r\nthe Secretary-General was deservedly commended; in\r\nAfrica, during the creation of the United Nations Mission\r\nin the Central African Republic, which was the first\r\nentirely new peacekeeping operation in four years; and\r\neven in the Balkans, where the difficult mission entrusted\r\nto the United Nations in Eastern Slavonia achieved its\r\nobjective.\r\nAnd yet, as the Secretary-General himself\r\nemphasized recently,\r\n“Unpredictability and surprise have become almost\r\ncommonplace” (A/53/1, para. 1),\r\nand the illusions of the end of the cold war have not\r\nstood the test of reality. Our world, let us acknowledge\r\nthis fact, is not moving towards greater harmony.\r\nSometimes our interventions are not appropriate; some\r\nStates take advantage of circumstances and deliberately\r\ncarry out archaic policies of force that contravene the\r\nprinciples of the Charter. On other occasions, the\r\nabdication or implosion of States has released among\r\nvarious groups ancestral forms of hatred that are still very\r\nmuch alive, thus facilitating organized crime. All these\r\nare destabilizing factors which, while very different, all\r\nhelp to disorganize and imperil international relations.\r\nSeveral major crises have proved this recently. The\r\nAsian financial crisis reminded us that strong growth,\r\nwhen badly regulated, is vulnerable in a globalized world\r\nthat is all too often dependent on the ultra-sensitive\r\nreactions of the trading floors and the increasingly rapid\r\nspread of contagious effects. Each day $1,600 billion is\r\nexchanged on the financial markets — huge sums of\r\nmoney that are greater than the means of intervention of\r\nall the financial institutions of the world. In 1970 those\r\namounts were equal to the world’s gross national product.\r\nToday, they are 15 times greater.\r\nThe nuclear tests in South Asia were a dramatic\r\nreminder that a very serious regional territorial dispute\r\ncombined with a feeling, justified or not, of insecurity\r\ncould open the way to nuclear and ballistic proliferation.\r\nIn East Africa, a typical armed conflict was born of\r\na border dispute. In the Great Lakes region, six or seven\r\nStates are in the grip of regional conflict on the territory\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Destabilization\r\nis threatening Central Asia, starting with Afghanistan. I\r\ncannot list them all, but currently more than 30 conflicts,\r\ncivil wars or State break-ups are under way that involve\r\nmore than 40 countries in their aftermath of suffering.\r\nTwenty-two million civilians — displaced persons and\r\nreturnees — have been affected by these conflicts and\r\nrequire assistance from the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, which is currently active\r\nin 118 countries. Nor can I fail to mention child soldiers;\r\nslavery, which still goes on in a scarcely veiled form;\r\ndisappeared persons; and so many other tragedies.\r\nBut I do not wish my statement to be a long litany of\r\nwoe that is only too familiar to the United Nations, which\r\nis the first to learn of these situations. Is it not at this very\r\nmoment trying to maintain peace on four continents with\r\napproximately 15,000 personnel engaged in about 17\r\noperations? To cite just one example, no fewer than 20\r\nagencies are trying to rebuild Bosnia.\r\nNor do I intend to neglect the progress achieved in\r\n1998, which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement.\r\nI wish simply to explain that the United Nations and the\r\nmultilateral system do not today have the necessary means\r\nto meet all these challenges. But we cannot and must not\r\ngive up. How can we restore the necessary vigour to our\r\naction?\r\nAllow me to make some suggestions in this area. First,\r\nwe can preserve the powers that the Charter has given our\r\ninstitutions. The first priority is to reserve for the Security\r\nCouncil a monopoly on legitimate enforcement action in the\r\ncase of “threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and\r\nacts of aggression”.\r\nNothing can justify the use of force by a State, a\r\ngroup of States or an organization, however powerful, if\r\nprior authorization was not received from the Security\r\nCouncil — except in cases of self-defence.\r\nMy country shares the impatience of those who\r\ndeplore the fact that it should take so long to find a solution\r\nto various cruel conflicts — for example, in Kosovo, where\r\nthe humanitarian situation is so critical. Since November\r\n1997 France has warned of the risks of explosion; it has put\r\nforward many proposals in liaison with Germany and its\r\nother partners in the Contact Group to prepare the ground\r\nfor a realistic political solution. It has just begun action for\r\nthe return of refugees. It has never ruled out the possible\r\nuse of force. On this latter point, I hear voices urging us to\r\nforgo the authorization of the Security Council. But after\r\nthis case there would be another exception, and then\r\nanother. Little by little, any country would declare itself\r\nentitled to intervene wherever its interests, security or\r\nambitions so required, and we would have to begin all\r\nover again. We must remain firm on this principle.\r\nSecond, we must make sure that the authority of the\r\nSecurity Council is respected and its resolutions are\r\ncomplied with. This goes for all its resolutions. But today\r\nthe question arises particularly in connection with Iraq.\r\nThe lifting of the oil embargo has, by the Council’s\r\nresolutions, been made subject to the controlled\r\ndismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must\r\ntherefore meet these conditions — completely meet them,\r\nbut only them. Once that objective is achieved, our aim\r\nmust be to reintegrate Iraq into the international\r\ncommunity, starting with the region.\r\nThe only way to achieve that end is by Iraq’s\r\ncomplete compliance with the relevant resolutions — all\r\nthe resolutions, nothing but the resolutions — which\r\nmeans Iraq’s unreserved cooperation with the United\r\nNations and the bodies empowered to monitor Iraq’s\r\ndisarmament.\r\nThe third need is to increase the representativeness\r\nof the Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy.\r\nThis is why my country has come out in favour of\r\nenlarging the Security Council, with, on the one hand,\r\nnew permanent members — two seats for the North, to\r\nwhich Germany and Japan have every claim, and three\r\nfor the South; on the other hand, there should be new\r\nnon-permanent members for the North and South. This\r\nenlargement must at the same time preserve the Council’s\r\neffectiveness and not prevent it from carrying out its\r\nresponsibilities under the Charter. I hope this fifty-third\r\nsession of the Assembly will see progress on this reform.\r\nFourth, we must increase the capacity of our\r\nOrganization to prevent or settle regional crises. There is\r\nmuch to be done. Now that the international community\r\nhas just commemorated on a melancholy note the fifth\r\nanniversary of the Oslo accords, what remains of the\r\npeace process in the Middle East and the hopes born in\r\nMadrid? There is no longer a light shining in the night,\r\nand the fires of hatred are gaining ground. France\r\ncontinues to support the persevering efforts of the United\r\nStates Secretary of State, but we do not wish to be left\r\nwithout any prospects at all should those efforts\r\nunfortunately not succeed. That is why President Chirac\r\nand President Mubarak have proposed in that event\r\nconvening a conference of countries resolved to save the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\npeace. This concern for the future has been very well\r\nreceived. In liaison with Mr. Amre Moussa, we are working\r\nto further our proposal. We must not abandon the goal of\r\nmeeting the aspirations of the peoples of this region for a\r\njust and lasting peace which respects the resolutions and\r\nagreements that have been reached.\r\nAnother region in crisis calls for our attention. As I\r\nmentioned earlier on the territory of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo six or seven African States of the\r\nGreat Lakes region are engaged in confrontation in a tangle\r\nof problems involving border issues, guerrilla activities,\r\nethnic strife, refugees, the quest for arable land and so\r\nforth. It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each\r\nof these States. A regional crisis such as this calls for a\r\nregional solution. That is why my country has raised again\r\nthe idea of a conference for peace in the Great Lakes\r\nregion, which we suggested as early as 1995. The\r\nconference would be placed under the aegis of the United\r\nNations or the Organization of African Unity, with the\r\nactive participation of the States of the region. Several\r\nAfrican diplomatic initiatives have the same goal. We\r\nsupport those efforts.\r\nAfrica is currently the theatre of other crises. Let us\r\npay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General’s\r\nrepresentatives. Here I salute in particular the memory of\r\nMaître Blondin Beye, who died while on a peace mission.\r\nFifth, there is a need to reinforce the multilateral\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation system. Following the\r\nnuclear tests in South Asia, whose risks everyone\r\nrecognizes, we must strengthen the anti-proliferation regime\r\nand pursue the disarmament process in all areas — nuclear,\r\nconventional, chemical and biological.\r\nOur primary objective here should be the entry into\r\nforce as speedily as possible of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. France, together with the United\r\nKingdom, was the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify the\r\nTreaty and is the only one to have completed the\r\ndismantlement of its testing centre. I call on all States that\r\nhave not yet done so to accede to this Treaty — including\r\nIndia and Pakistan, which have announced their intention\r\nnot to carry out any more nuclear tests.\r\nAnother objective here would be a treaty banning the\r\nproduction of fissile material for military purposes. I\r\nproposed at the meeting of the five permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council held in Geneva on 4 June last that we\r\nshould launch such a negotiation. A universal, non-\r\ndiscriminatory and verifiable cut-off treaty would give\r\nnew impetus to disarmament.\r\nWe should also pursue relentlessly the prohibition of\r\nchemical and biological weapons. Let us see to it that the\r\nConvention banning chemical weapons becomes universal\r\nand that the Convention banning biological weapons is\r\nmade truly effective through a verification mechanism.\r\nCombating the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction also means preventing the spread of vehicles\r\ncapable of delivering such weapons, while preserving\r\nuseful civilian applications.\r\nIn order to make progress in conventional\r\ndisarmament, let us ensure that the Ottawa Convention\r\nproviding for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel\r\nmines comes into force as soon as possible.\r\nSixth, we should continue to combat\r\nunderdevelopment, whose link with crises needs no\r\nfurther demonstration. France remains heavily committed;\r\nit is the second largest provider of official development\r\nassistance. In order to modernize its aid and make it more\r\neffective, France has decided to reform its cooperation\r\narrangements and increase coordination with other donors\r\n— in the first place with the European Union. More than\r\n60 per cent of aid to Africa comes from the European\r\nUnion. Europe is also the largest source of aid to Latin\r\nAmerica and the second largest to Asia.\r\nFrance would like development resources to be more\r\npredictable. The Secretary-General has made proposals\r\nthat we welcome in a constructive spirit, in particular the\r\nidea of a development account. We encourage the United\r\nNations to continue its discussions in this area.\r\nSeventh, we need to work with the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. They are capable of sounding\r\nthe alarm, making proposals and cooperating in very\r\npractical terms to help build States governed by the rule\r\nof law. Parallel to these actions, we expect much from the\r\nactivities of Mrs. Robinson, United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, both in the Commission\r\non Human Rights and in the various United Nations\r\nagencies, which must also — all of them — integrate the\r\nhuman rights dimension into their activities.\r\nAfter more than 10 years of negotiations, 1998 will\r\nsee the adoption of the declaration on the defenders of\r\nhuman rights. This is a crucial text because these are the\r\nrights that dictatorships try to stifle and threaten.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nHowever, even if we reinforce the Security Council,\r\nstrengthen the hand of the Secretary-General and better\r\nhandle future crises and other aspects of existing ones, this\r\nwill still not be enough. We must regain the initiative, and\r\nfor that we must extend our efforts to bring worldwide\r\nregulation to other fields. This brings me to my final points.\r\nThe eighth requirement is to extend the rule of law in\r\nall its aspects. The Statute of a permanent International\r\nCriminal Court was adopted in Rome after intensive\r\nnegotiations. It is a major step forward in the fight against\r\nthe impunity of the foremost criminals. France was one of\r\nthe first to sign it. The Statute achieves an essential\r\nsynthesis of the various legal traditions in the world and\r\nstrikes a balance between the Court’s competences and the\r\npowers of the Security Council that is in keeping with the\r\nspirit and calling of the United Nations. We hope that those\r\ncountries that still have reservations will be able to join us.\r\nIn another field of law, the International Labour\r\nOrganization has taken a historic step towards universal\r\ncompliance with basic labour standards through the\r\ndeclaration adopted at its eighty-sixth conference, which is\r\na commitment on the part of the 174 member States of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nOn 11 November 1997 the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization adopted\r\nthe Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and\r\nHuman Rights. This is the first normative framework to\r\nguide the international community in an area of scientific\r\nresearch where advances are already shaking our traditional\r\nconcepts of life and social organization. France is\r\nsubmitting a draft resolution calling on the General\r\nAssembly to endorse this Universal Declaration.\r\nNinth, we must contain and reduce the scourge of\r\norganized crime, beginning with drugs. The volume of\r\nillegal drug trafficking now approaches $500 billion — 8\r\nper cent to 10 per cent of world trade. According to the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, money-laundering operations\r\nrepresent from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global gross\r\ndomestic product.\r\nAt the special session in New York in June we\r\ndecided to put more emphasis on reducing the demand for\r\ndrugs, in addition to what we have done about supply. Let\r\nus do so.\r\nTenth, we must combat terrorism in all its forms,\r\nwhoever the perpetrators and whatever their motivation.\r\nThe recent International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings is an important step\r\nforward, but that is not enough. We must also acquire the\r\nmeans to hunt down those who finance and instigate these\r\nattacks. France is proposing the negotiation of a universal\r\nconvention against the financing of terrorism.\r\nWe need to define concrete mechanisms for legal\r\nmeasures and mutual judicial assistance against those who\r\nfinance terrorism. Effective sanctions, such as the seizure\r\nor the freezing of the assets of organizations or\r\nindividuals that have participated in terrorist acts must be\r\nprovided for. Innovative measures, such as making it\r\nimpossible to invoke banking secrecy in judicial bodies\r\ninvestigating a terrorist attack, should be introduced. If we\r\nhave the will to do this, we can launch this negotiation at\r\nthe end of the present session of the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Clinton spoke here on Monday of this\r\ncommon struggle as a shared obligation. This is correct.\r\nIn addition, we need to attack the multiple causes that\r\nbreed terrorism.\r\nThe eleventh point I would like to make concerns\r\nthe remedy for not only the current financial crises, but\r\nalso the malfunctioning of the international financial\r\nsystem as such. That is the issue here, as is shown by the\r\nincreasing calls for a “new Bretton Woods”. Financial\r\nglobalization is running wild now. New means urgently\r\nneed to be found. It is the responsibility of each State to\r\nmake its contribution. We need also to define new rules\r\nadapted to today’s financial realities. My country is today\r\npresenting to its European partners some proposals to\r\ncounter international financial instability.\r\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) must\r\nnaturally remain the pivot here. But the IMF must be\r\nmore legitimate and more effective, working on the basis\r\nof clear, realistic, political and strategic guidelines,\r\ncooperating with other competent bodies, organizing\r\ndialogue between industrialized countries and emerging\r\ncountries, ensuring the transparency of the financial\r\nsystem and reflecting the economic, social and political\r\nrealities of partner countries — an IMF that can detect\r\nearly warning signs to prevent crises from happening.\r\nWithin this transformation, to which the Director-\r\nGeneral of the IMF is making an important contribution,\r\nand also in order better to stabilize the international\r\neconomic and monetary situation and to support world\r\ngrowth, Europe will play an increasingly important role\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nsince it is finalizing the introduction of its single currency,\r\nthe euro, and we are anticipating the benefits.\r\nFrom this period we are living through, which is so\r\nfull of contrasts, consisting of unprecedented progress and\r\nof crises threatening to wipe out our efforts, in particular\r\nthose made under the aegis of the United Nations,\r\nadditional progress must be forthcoming in building a more\r\njust and more peaceful world, because this is what we all\r\nwant.\r\nToday’s world needs rules. The United Nations must\r\nremain the unifying framework, and the Charter must\r\nremain the reference point. Preserving what has proved its\r\nworth, adapting when necessary, inventing new forms of\r\nregulation — these are three main areas for our work.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Lamberto Dini, to whom I give the floor.\r\nMr. Dini (Italy): I congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly, a sure\r\nguarantee of the success of the fifty-third session. At the\r\nsame time, I wish to thank your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko, for his fine job in handling the difficult issues\r\nthat arose last year.\r\nOn the broader issues facing the General Assembly in\r\nthe year to come, Italy associates itself with and supports\r\nthe statement made on Tuesday by the Foreign Minister of\r\nAustria on behalf of the European Union.\r\nFewer than 10 years have gone by since the euphoric\r\ndays that surrounded the fall of the Berlin Wall. As our\r\ndecade began, “a new world order” was on everyone’s lips.\r\nMany believed that we were at the threshold of a new age\r\nof stability, freedom and prosperity. In the ensuing years,\r\nwe have indeed witnessed rapid growth in the world\r\neconomy, but we have also seen an outbreak of new forms\r\nof nationalism, ethnic hostilities and acts of aggression.\r\nOur peoples have grown apprehensive about the future\r\nas they watch the performance of the stock market, internal\r\ninstability in various regions of the world, the failure of\r\nfinancial institutions, the rise and unpredictability of\r\nterrorism, unchecked waves of immigration, the constant\r\nflow of refugees and the resurgence of misplaced nuclear\r\nambitions. In some countries, a few short months of crisis\r\nwas all it took to wipe out the gains of an entire generation.\r\nSuch crises shed light on an improper balance\r\nbetween the power of the market and the power of\r\ninstitutions. Globalization and liberalization certainly have\r\ngreat merits. They have forced the national political\r\nclasses to set public finances in order and to promote\r\neconomic efficiency. But a global market requires some\r\nmeasure of global government built on the knowledge that\r\nthe wealth of single States cannot be separated from the\r\nwelfare of the international community, a government\r\nwhose strength rests on the democracy of institutions. As\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan underlined in his speech,\r\nglobalization requires good government.\r\nThis is why we urgently need to strengthen\r\ninternational leadership. The institutions are still not\r\nstrong enough to provide such leadership, restore\r\nconfidence, introduce change, stabilize the global\r\neconomy, guarantee growth and protect the most\r\nvulnerable of us in the race towards development.\r\nTechnology, communications and the market are\r\nprogressing at a much faster pace than politics and\r\ninstitutions, thus creating a widening gap.\r\nIn the final years of this century, our challenge is to\r\nstrengthen institutions and their capacity to coordinate the\r\naction of Governments. Globalization has impacts on\r\nideologies and behaviour, societies and institutions. The\r\nopening of markets to competition must be accompanied\r\nby reaffirmed cooperation among the largest possible\r\nnumber of States. The burden of responsibility falls on\r\nthe shoulders of the stronger nations, particularly those of\r\nthe G-7. They have a duty to show solidarity,\r\ntransforming their privileges into benefits for all\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe system of international institutions has the\r\nUnited Nations as its paramount and most authoritative\r\nbenchmark. The United Nations must be the driving force\r\nbehind a review of the network of interdependence. Like\r\nindustrialization in its early days, globalization produces\r\nboth great progress and dangerous imbalances. Thus, it\r\nrequires governance. No one country can govern it,\r\nhowever great its political, economic and military power.\r\nOur century is drawing to a close with a revitalization of\r\ninstitutions upon which we can build the three pillars of\r\nstability: prosperity, security and respect for fundamental\r\nfreedoms.\r\nThe first pillar of stability is governance of the\r\neconomy to prevent crises from degenerating into\r\ncatastrophes. The time has come to perfect the rules of\r\nconduct that guide the development of the global market.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nWhile these rules are imperfect and not always respected,\r\nwe must assert the conviction that it is important and\r\nappropriate to observe them. This is the secret of their\r\nsuccess. It is up to the economically stronger countries to\r\nguarantee continuity in the development of the market.\r\nThey must be buyers, lenders and the final guarantors if we\r\nare to instil confidence and forestall the threat of a global\r\nrecession. The forces that drive the global economy are the\r\nsame as those that uphold the fundamental freedoms: the\r\ncirculation of information and ideas; open borders and\r\nsocieties; the rule of law and individual rights. The\r\nchallenges facing the economy are the same as those facing\r\nfreedom.\r\nAt times, the markets are driven by a short-term logic\r\nthat privileges the earnings of today over the growth of\r\ntomorrow. They conduct constant but instant referendums.\r\nThe stock market does not always move at the same pace\r\nas the economy and society. Relentless technological\r\nprogress can lead to the exclusion of many from the world\r\nof employment. Recent major economic and financial crises\r\nshow that the market does not always grow when the State\r\nshrinks. Rather than enhancing freedom, sometimes it only\r\nincreases the power of the strongest. It is a dangerous\r\nillusion to think the economic sphere can be unhinged from\r\nthe political system, the social context and the history of\r\nnations. There can be no healthy economy without a strong\r\nState, without the rule of law, without social cohesiveness\r\nand protections — in other words, without respect for\r\npeoples or awareness of their history.\r\nThe market’s supporters should not turn into the\r\nstandard bearers for a new fundamentalism. The\r\ninternational financial institutions must know how to couple\r\ntheory and practice, how to avoid strategies that damage\r\nsociety and destabilize the political system for the sake of\r\ndefending the market. They must initiate policies and\r\nreforms that minimize moral hazards in their rescue\r\noperations. They must look at society as a whole and not\r\njust at its financial dimensions. Otherwise, some will rebel\r\nagainst or flee the market.\r\nThe United Nations and the international community\r\ncan rely on the new cohesiveness of the European Union.\r\nThe European currency, the Euro, demands new\r\nresponsibilities at the international level as a repository of\r\nvalue and as an investment and reserve currency. It will\r\nallow the Union to project abroad standards that it would\r\nnot otherwise be able to preserve, such as stability,\r\ncompetition and social solidarity. The European Union has\r\nno intention of hiding behind the shield of its currency. It\r\nhas no illusions of being an oasis of prosperity sheltered\r\nfrom the tempests of the world.\r\nThe politicians of Europe are the first to have\r\nrethought the limits of national sovereignty. Today, the\r\nEuropean Union, in the wake of the single currency, is\r\nabout to become a political subject, and to participate as\r\nsuch in world leadership, to correct the fragility of the\r\ncomplex systems that govern the world. It is not enough\r\nto have strong national powers. For the European Union,\r\ntoo, the time has come to be a “leading nation”. The time\r\nhas come to further enhance the rules that have allowed\r\nus to unite the continent, banishing war within our\r\nborders.\r\nTo the South, Europe is facing massive waves of\r\nimmigration. Europe is well aware of the needs that drive\r\nto its shores so many people trying to escape from\r\nsuffocating demographic trends. Europe knows that the\r\nonly solution is an ambitious policy of solidarity and\r\ndevelopment. Otherwise, like King Canute, it would be\r\ntrying to hold back the sea with a wave of its hand.\r\nOur cooperation policies must be revitalized to help\r\nclose the gap between North and South. The Economic\r\nand Social Council, whose presidency will be assumed by\r\nItaly at the start of the coming year, can be instrumental\r\nin eradicating poverty and harmonizing the differences\r\nbetween and the needs of the two hemispheres.\r\nRenewed institutions will also have to manage the\r\nsecond pillar of stability: security. Here, too, the United\r\nNations must play a central role. I refer not only to its\r\ntraditional role of direct involvement in peacekeeping\r\noperations. Italy, I would underline, continues to provide\r\na strong logistic base, as well as men and resources, for\r\nsuch missions and has long proposed ways to make these\r\noperations more efficient and effective.\r\nI refer also to the novelty of the future: growing\r\nrelations with other institutions, including the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to which the\r\ntransatlantic community entrusts its defence. The Atlantic\r\nAlliance is redefining its strategies, missions and\r\nmembership, but it is also rethinking its relations with the\r\nUnited Nations in a new spirit. It is looking to the United\r\nNations for additional legitimacy to broaden the scope of\r\nits mission. This is another crucial aspect of the system of\r\ninstitutions that can guarantee peace and stability and on\r\nwhich we must build our future.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nPeace is also jeopardized by resurgent temptations to\r\nbrandish nuclear weapons in an effort to restore regional\r\nbalances, enhance national prestige and consolidate national\r\nunity. While such goals can be in themselves legitimate,\r\nthey become totally illusory if entrusted to the proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, instruments that threaten\r\nthe very right to life. In the framework of institutional\r\nstrengthening, we must, as a matter of priority, root out\r\nsenseless ambitions that rely on lethal weapons. We must\r\naim instead to complete the non-proliferation regime and\r\nmake it more effective and more universal.\r\nSecurity is jeopardized by a breed of terrorism that has\r\nbecome more and more irrational, threatening fragile peace\r\nprocesses, privatizing terror and directing its hatred mostly,\r\nbut not exclusively, against the Western world and the\r\nvalues it represents. We must therefore redouble our\r\ncommon efforts to fight this scourge.\r\nIndividual rights are the third component of\r\ninstitutional strengthening, along with prosperity and\r\nsecurity. The market and fundamental freedoms, as we\r\nincreasingly discover, are two sides of the same coin. But\r\nhuman rights are likely to remain abstract or illusory if the\r\nUnited Nations cannot enforce them to the benefit of all\r\nindividuals and, if necessary, also against their\r\nGovernments.\r\nThe international community, and all of us\r\nindividually, must deepen our commitment to safeguard\r\nthese rights. The measure of our civilization is the\r\nprotection we afford to the weakest and most vulnerable\r\nsocial groups. I am thinking first of children who are\r\nvictims of atrocities whose true dimensions the media is\r\nonly now beginning to expose.\r\nThe Rome Statute to establish the International\r\nCriminal Court represents what is probably the greatest\r\ninstitutional advancement since the San Francisco Charter.\r\nIn this field, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration\r\nof Human Rights, it confers certainty and universality on\r\nthe Charter’s system of values. But here, too, we must\r\ncomplete our journey. Therefore, I urge those countries that\r\nhave not yet done so — and they are the majority — to\r\nsign the Statute and to start to move towards prompt\r\nratification.\r\nThe core of every reform touches on the Security\r\nCouncil. It is not enough to strengthen institutions: we must\r\nmake them more democratic and representative. And it is\r\non the concepts of democracy and representation that the\r\ndebate over the future of the Security Council pivots.\r\nSignificant progress has been made in recent months\r\nin identifying measures aimed at improving the\r\ntransparency and the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil: greater openness of informal consultations; more\r\ninvolvement of countries that contribute troops to\r\npeacekeeping operations and multilateral forces; more\r\nprompt and detailed briefings on the Council’s activities\r\nby the President-in-office; and ready availability of texts\r\nand documents being examined by the Council.\r\nBut the stalemate continues on the issue of enlarging\r\nthe Council. The Italian Government will be willing to\r\nsupport any reasonable formula, provided that it does not\r\nprejudice the eventual establishment of a common\r\nEuropean seat on the Council, distance Italy from the\r\nother principal industrial countries or increase the number\r\nof countries that are “more equal” than others,\r\ntransforming the majority of Member States from\r\nprotagonists into mere spectators.\r\nThe essential problem is one of principles and\r\ncriteria. Italy has made and will continue to make an\r\nactive contribution to this question that is of fundamental\r\nimportance to international peace and stability. It will\r\ncontinue to fight for a more democratic, efficient and\r\ngeographically representative Security Council. No one\r\nshould feel excluded. Every country, no matter how large\r\nor small, has a contribution to make, an experience to\r\nshare.\r\nGiven the current stalemate over increasing the\r\nnumber of permanent members, we wonder whether it\r\nwould not make more sense to concentrate for the time\r\nbeing only on an increase in non-permanent seats. The\r\nsolution of increasing the number of elective seats for\r\nevery regional group would make it easier for all Member\r\nStates to have access to the Security Council. After all,\r\nthis is the same solution that was adopted in 1963, when\r\nthe only previous enlargement of the Council took place.\r\nAs to the method we should follow to get there, we\r\nbelieve that on a matter of such crucial importance it is\r\nessential that any decision with Charter amendment\r\nimplications should be adopted by a majority of two\r\nthirds of all Member States, as prescribed by Article 108\r\nof the Charter.\r\nThese are some of our suggestions for the “quiet\r\nrevolution” of the United Nations, to which Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan has dedicated such passion. We are\r\ngrateful to him for his efforts.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nThe century that is about to end has taught that there\r\nare no definitive and total solutions. Although the\r\ninstitutions are imperfect, they are flexible instruments. It\r\nis our high duty to improve them so that they can become\r\nthe visible hand of stability, together with the invisible hand\r\nof the market. Institutions are the only truly indispensable\r\npower.\r\nMr. Ba-Jammal (Yemen), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nnow call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United\r\nArab Emirates, His Excellency The Honourable Rashid\r\nAbdullah Al-Noaimi.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates): I have the\r\nhonour to extend to the President the congratulations of the\r\ndelegation of the United Arab Emirates on his election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. We are confident that his wise leadership and vast\r\ndiplomatic experience in international affairs will contribute\r\nto strengthening the role of the Organization in the world\r\ntoday.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nUkraine, for the distinguished manner in which he directed\r\nthe work of the previous session. We also wish to express\r\nour deep appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his endeavours to maintain peace, security and\r\nstability in the world.\r\nAs we stand at the threshold of a new millennium, the\r\ninternational community is witnessing radical changes in\r\ninternational relations, the implications of which are\r\nreflected in the lives of peoples. The various aspects of\r\nopenness and globalization embodied in some of those\r\nchanges have not been comprehensive in their positive\r\naspects, but have resulted in widely divergent levels of\r\neconomic and social development among States and have\r\npromoted the emergence of new patterns of problems that\r\nrequire radical joint international solutions to contain and\r\ndeal with them.\r\nThere is now an increased awareness in the world of\r\nthe inevitability of renewing and developing the United\r\nNations as the essential international tool for dealing with\r\ncurrent world problems and achieving balance, transparency\r\nand justice in international relations.\r\nConsequently, we support the positions of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement and the Group of 77 regarding these\r\nvital issues, particularly the questions within the purview\r\nof the General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, and the reform of the Security Council and\r\nenlargement of its membership. We also call for\r\nstrengthening coordination, cooperation and dialogue\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations in\r\norder to mobilize and complement joint international\r\nefforts to deal with many issues on the agenda.\r\nThe world has seen positive efforts in the area of\r\ninternational law, the most important of which were\r\nreflected in the conclusion of a number of international\r\nconventions. The latest of these efforts was the\r\nestablishment in Rome of an International Criminal Court,\r\nwhich we regard as an important step that will contribute\r\nto supporting the principles of human rights worldwide.\r\nWe also call for reactivating the role of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, which is the essential legal instrument\r\nfor settling disputes between States.\r\nPolitical events in the world, and particularly in the\r\nArab Gulf region, have proved that radical solutions to\r\nregional disputes can only be achieved through peaceful\r\nmeans and methods based on the principles of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and international law. Proceeding\r\nfrom this belief, and true to those principles, the United\r\nArab Emirates has adopted a wise policy in its quest for\r\na peaceful solution to the question of the occupation by\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran of its three islands —\r\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — which form\r\nan integral part of our national sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity.\r\nThe continued consolidation by Iran of its illegal\r\noccupation of those islands and the imposition of a policy\r\nof fait accompli through numerous military and civilian\r\nmeasures designed to change their historical, demographic\r\nand legal characteristics are a source of grave tension and\r\nconcern in the region. This runs counter to good-\r\nneighbourly relations, peaceful coexistence and\r\nconfidence-building, as well as to the Charters of both the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference. Such actions are also incompatible with the\r\napproaches taken by the members of the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil, which call for the settlement of existing disputes\r\nby peaceful means in order to achieve permanent security\r\nand stability in the region and strengthen relations and\r\ncommon interests between the States members of the Gulf\r\nCooperation Council and Iran.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nAccordingly, once again from this rostrum we appeal\r\nto the Government of friendly Iran to demonstrate a serious\r\npolitical will and accept our genuinely peaceful initiative,\r\nsupported by all fraternal and friendly States, either to\r\nengage with us in dialogue and enter into bilateral\r\nnegotiations that would address the legal and historical\r\nbackground of this question, not just its formalities, or\r\naccept resort to the International Court of Justice with a\r\nview to reaching a just and permanent settlement conducive\r\nto terminating the Iranian occupation of our three islands.\r\nOnce again we reaffirm that our call for solving this dispute\r\npeacefully emanates from the nature of our historical\r\nrelations with Iran and proceeds from our commitment to\r\nthe essential principles governing international relations.\r\nThis is also in the interest of preserving peace, security and\r\nstability in our region and throughout the world.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates renews its support for all\r\npeaceful efforts and endeavours by the Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations towards resumption of the activities of\r\nthe Special Commission in Iraq. But we consider it\r\nnecessary, in order to avoid any further escalation or\r\nrenewed tensions in the region, and in the light of the\r\nimportance of preserving the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq and non-interference in its international\r\naffairs, to continue upgrading the food-for-oil programme\r\nand improving its operation in order to meet the\r\nhumanitarian needs of the fraternal Iraqi people and to\r\nalleviate its ceaseless suffering. At the same time, we urge\r\nthe Iraqi Government to fully implement all the relevant\r\nresolutions of international legitimacy particularly those\r\nrelating to the release of the prisoners of war and detainees,\r\ncitizens of sisterly Kuwait and other States, and to complete\r\nthe restitution of Kuwaiti property so as to ensure the lifting\r\nof the sanctions imposed on Iraq and to enable it to resume\r\nits natural role at the regional and international levels.\r\nThe Middle East peace process is at a dangerous\r\nstalemate on all its tracks as a result of the adoption by the\r\nIsraeli Government of a policy of gradual recanting on all\r\nthe obligations and undertakings it has assumed under this\r\nprocess. The most dangerous aspect of that policy is that\r\nGovernment’s resolve to proceed with implementing its\r\nplans for building more Jewish settlements in the occupied\r\nPalestinian and other Arab territories, particularly in the city\r\nof Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan. It daily perpetrates\r\natrocious and inhuman crimes against the Palestinian and\r\nother Arab peoples, which constitutes a flagrant violation of\r\nthe basic principles on which that process and the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention of 1949 are based.\r\nAware of the danger inherent in the continuation of\r\nthese illegal Israeli acts, we believe there is a need for\r\neffective action by the international community — in\r\nparticular, the co-sponsors of the peace process and the\r\nEuropean Union — to bring additional pressure to bear on\r\nIsrael to force it to comply with its legal obligations and\r\nto demand that it resume the negotiations, without\r\npreconditions, on the different tracks of the peace process,\r\non the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\r\nand 338 (1973) and the principle of land for peace. We\r\nalso express our unceasing support for the Palestinian\r\npeople in their quest for self-determination and their\r\nlegitimate aspiration to establish their independent State\r\non their national soil, with Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nSimilarly, we support the position of the Government of\r\nLebanon, demanding that Israel implement fully Security\r\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978), which calls on Israel to\r\nend unconditionally its military occupation of the south of\r\nLebanon and its western Bekaa valley without condition.\r\nThe establishment of a zone free of all kinds of\r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and Arab\r\nGulf regions is a requirement that complements the peace\r\nprocess and represents an essential factor in the security\r\nand stability of those regions. Accordingly, the\r\ninternational community should demand that the\r\nGovernment of Israel accede to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and subject its\r\nnuclear installations to the control and safeguards regime\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency. International\r\nmeasures which so far have been achieved in the area of\r\nworld disarmament have not been global in their\r\ncoverage, especially since we are witnessing an arms race\r\nand testing of nuclear and other proscribed weapons. Such\r\ndevelopments will not lead to the settlement of existing\r\ndisputes between States, but, rather, to an imbalance in\r\nregional security, as is the case between India and\r\nPakistan and in other regions.\r\nWe therefore urge both friendly countries to exercise\r\nself-restraint, renounce the use of force and resume\r\ndialogue and negotiations with a view to reducing\r\ntensions and solving their current disputes peacefully in\r\na manner that will serve the interests of security and\r\nstability in that region. We also call upon the nuclear-\r\nweapon States, and those in possession of such dangerous\r\nweapons, to reconsider their policies, to refrain from\r\napplying double standards and to promote the adoption of\r\nequal measures for confidence-building among States.\r\nSerious steps must be taken by the United Nations to deal\r\nwith this shortcoming in a way that contributes to the\r\ncreation of a peaceful and stable world free from tension\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nand from the threat or use of such prohibited weapons and\r\ntheir damaging effects on humanity.\r\nWhile we appreciate the efforts of the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping forces, in cooperation with the regional\r\norganizations, to deal with and contain conflicts and civil\r\nand regional wars in certain parts of the world, we are still\r\nconcerned about the failure to contain several crises in\r\nother parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, the\r\nGreat Lakes region, Angola and other hotbeds of tension.\r\nRecent examples are the situations between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea and between Iran and Afghanistan, as well as that\r\nin Kosovo, where the human rights of Muslims are being\r\nflagrantly violated by the Yugoslav Serb forces, whose\r\nactions we strongly condemn as contradicting legally\r\nbinding international norms and principles. The United\r\nNations, and the Security Council in particular, must\r\nassume their responsibilities in putting an end to such\r\nconflicts and violations and should promote the\r\nparticipation of regional organizations in finding adequate\r\npeaceful solutions to those problems. We also call upon the\r\nparties concerned to cooperate in such efforts by\r\ndemonstrating the political will necessary to settle their\r\ndisputes by peaceful means.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates strongly condemns the\r\nterrorist acts that were carried out recently in some African\r\nStates, resulting in heavy losses of lives and property. On\r\nthe basis of ethical and humanitarian responsibility, the\r\ninternational community should intensify its efforts to\r\nprotect civilians and their rights and to confront the\r\nphenomenon of terrorism, regardless of its origin or form.\r\nHowever, combating this dangerous phenomenon should not\r\nbe carried out on a unilateral basis or through\r\nindiscriminate military revenge, which destroys lives and\r\nproperty, but through joint international action within the\r\nframework of the United Nations in order to ensure the\r\nelimination of all the root causes and manifestations of\r\nterrorism and thereby preserve the security and stability of\r\nsocieties and the territorial integrity of States.\r\nThe world economic and financial environment\r\ncontinues to undergo numerous challenges which have\r\nvarying implications for development. Despite the\r\nliberalization of trade, the open markets and the\r\nglobalization of the economy that have characterized\r\ninternational relations, developing countries, representing a\r\nmajority of the population of this planet, are still facing a\r\nmultitude of problems especially together with the\r\nexacerbation of unemployment, illiteracy and poverty, in\r\naddition to debts and the cost of servicing them, declining\r\nhumanitarian and development assistance which have\r\nbecome a heavy burden on many of those States,\r\nparticularly the least developed countries. As a result,\r\ntheir development problems have increased, and that in\r\nturn has led to the creation of a state of instability and\r\nsocial disintegration.\r\nRecent economic and financial crises in South-East\r\nAsia and other regions not only pose challenges to\r\nsustainable development, but also demonstrate that there\r\nare clear imbalances in the world monetary, economic and\r\ntrade systems. Therefore, we call for the development of\r\nglobal economic and financial strategies to remedy the\r\nreal causes of this phenomenon in order to achieve\r\nstability in the world financial, economic and trade\r\nsystems. This will also require the reform of international\r\ndevelopment and financial institutions to enable them to\r\nadapt to the changing economic situation in the world and\r\neffectively contribute to addressing many of those\r\nproblems. That in turn will require the initiation of\r\ncomprehensive and objective North-South dialogue, which\r\nshould lead to the fulfilment of the goals shared by both\r\nthe developing and developed countries.\r\nIn conclusion, I hope that the deliberations of the\r\nAssembly at this session will succeed in reaching positive\r\nresolutions that address our concerns as they are reflected\r\non the agenda for this session for the benefit, prosperity,\r\nsecurity and stability of our States and peoples.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, His Excellency\r\nMr. Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe.\r\nMr. Okoto Lolakombe (Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo) (interpretation from French): I should like first of\r\nall to carry out the noble duty of adding my voice to\r\nthose who have spoken before me from this rostrum in\r\ncongratulating Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nregular session. I am convinced that with the effective\r\ncooperation of the elected members of his Bureau, he will\r\nspare no effort to ensure the success of our work.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for the skill with\r\nwhich he so honourably discharged his weighty\r\nresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-second session.\r\nThe fifty-third session of the General Assembly is\r\ntaking place at a time when my country, the Democratic\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nRepublic of the Congo, is the victim of armed aggression\r\nby its neighbours, Rwanda and Uganda, that has been\r\ntaking place since 2 August. The seriousness of the actions\r\nof these two invading countries, which are States parties to\r\nthe noble ideals of the charters of the United Nations and\r\nof the Organization of African Unity (OUA), obliges me to\r\ndwell at length on this dispute in the hope of helping the\r\nAssembly understand better the drama that is currently\r\ntaking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, my\r\ndear homeland.\r\nIn order to enable the Assembly better to understand\r\nthis war and all of its consequences, a brief reminder of the\r\nfacts is necessary.\r\nOn 27 July 1998, the President of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Mzee Laurent-Désiré Kabila, after\r\nconsultations with his Rwandan and Ugandan counterparts\r\ntook the sovereign decision to terminate Rwanda’s military\r\nand technical cooperation and to put an end to the presence\r\nof foreign troops throughout the national territory.\r\nWhen Rwanda’s troops left Congolese territory, it was\r\nnoticed that certain Tutsis of Rwandan origin, called\r\nBanyamulenge, followed suit.\r\nA week later, Congolese towns bordering on\r\nRwanda — Goma, Bukavu and Uvira — were seized by\r\narmed elements that came from that neighbouring country.\r\nOn 6 August, aircraft started shuttling between Goma\r\nand Kitona, in the west of the country, via Kigali, over a\r\ndistance of more than 2000 kilometres. After one of the\r\ncivilian pilots was killed for refusing to carry out orders,\r\nthese aircraft were diverted from Goma airport to transport\r\ntroops and matériel the west, under the direction of Mr.\r\nJames Kabarehe, the ex-Chief of Staff of the Congo.\r\nAt the same time, columns of armoured vehicles and\r\nother military equipment crossed the border from Uganda\r\nunder the pretext of defending Ugandan interests in the\r\nCongo.\r\nDespite the protests of the Congolese Government,\r\nwhich demanded their immediate withdrawal, Ugandan\r\ntroops surrounded the town of Bunia in the eastern part of\r\nthe country on 13 August 1998.\r\nOn the same day, the Inga hydroelectric dam was\r\noccupied by the Rwandan-Ugandan coalition forces. They\r\nsabotaged the installations in order to deprive the capital,\r\nKinshasa, of electricity and drinking water.\r\nOn 23 August 1998, Ugandan troops attacked\r\nKisangani, in the north-eastern part of the country, and\r\nlater occupied it.\r\nThese facts, and these acts of violence — confirmed\r\nby independent sources — provide ample proof of the\r\naggressive involvement of Kigali and Kampala in the\r\nhuge plot to Balkanize the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, all in defiance of international law and the\r\nprinciple of the inviolability of borders inherited from the\r\ncolonial period, pursuant to the Charter of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity.\r\nIndeed, one of the two aggressor countries, Uganda,\r\nmade no bones about admitting publicly that its troops\r\noccupied certain positions in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo.\r\nAs can be seen, what some media sources wrongly\r\ndescribed as a rebellion from the east was simply a\r\nshameful plot to destabilize my country politically and\r\neconomically, and the covetous intentions of Rwanda and\r\nUganda regarding my country’s many natural resources\r\nwere barely concealed.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is once again\r\npaying a high price for this war imposed on it from the\r\noutside. Among the countless examples are the massacres\r\nof thousands of innocent Congolese, including members\r\nof religious orders, women, children and elderly people in\r\nthe east and in the west. These sordid crimes remind us\r\nof the killing of Hutu refugees by elements of the same\r\nRwandan Patriotic Army. Further examples include the\r\nmassive deportations from Kivu towards Rwanda of\r\npeople whose fate remains unknown; the summary\r\nexecutions of prisoners of war; the dismantling, sabotage\r\nand destruction of the industrial, shipping and economic\r\ninfrastructure of the country, damage which, to date, has\r\nbeen estimated at about $3 billion for Matadi alone; the\r\nmore than three-week cut in the provision of electric\r\npower and water to the capital, Kinshasa, a city of more\r\nthan 6 million people, which was a real humanitarian\r\ntragedy, as is illustrated by the fact that large stocks of\r\nfresh foodstuffs were declared unfit for consumption;\r\nreports of countless deaths in the hospitals because\r\ndoctors were unable to work in the conditions required by\r\ntheir noble profession; and the postponement, sine die, of\r\nthe polio vaccination campaign mandated by the World\r\nHealth Organization, with untold consequences on the\r\nlives of our children, which gravely compromises the\r\nfuture of our country.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nDespite the situation of aggression, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, which is a peace-loving nation that\r\nrespects international conventions reaffirms its commitment\r\nto the principles of the Charter and its unshakeable faith in\r\nthe promotion of a culture of peace in the Great Lakes\r\nregion.\r\nThe first manifestation of this ideal was demonstrated\r\nby the Government when it appealed to the Security\r\nCouncil and the Secretary-General to obtain the immediate\r\nand unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces.\r\nUnfortunately, the reaction of the international\r\ncommunity did not match the gravity of the situation in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Even one of the most\r\nimportant bodies in the United Nations system — the\r\nSecurity Council — after much procrastination, merely\r\nissued a few ambiguous statements calling for a ceasefire\r\nand the withdrawal of foreign troops without, unfortunately,\r\nspecifying them by name. On the other hand, in similar\r\ncases — in Kosovo, in Bosnia and in Kuwait — the\r\nSecurity Council dealt with the situation promptly and\r\npractically to restore peace. Why was there this silence\r\nfrom the international community, particularly from\r\nSecurity Council? The Council’s policy of double standards\r\non this issue could set an unfortunate precedent that could\r\nseriously undermine the credibility of the United Nations\r\nand wipe out the reform efforts under way.\r\nGiven this situation that does no credit to our\r\ncommunity, the Government of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, mindful of its heavy responsibilities to\r\nguarantee the territorial integrity of the country, was\r\nobliged to resort to an armed response to put an end to the\r\ninvasion. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo appealed to its allies to\r\ndeal with Ugandan-Rwandan aggression.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank member\r\ncountries of the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC), in particular, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe,\r\nwhich responded to our appeal. I would also like to pay\r\ntribute to the valiant Congolese people, who undertook to\r\ndefend their homeland when it was under attack. I am also\r\ngrateful to Belgium, which had the courage to publicly\r\ncondemn a country in the Great Lakes region that was\r\ninvolved in this act of aggression, and to Ms. Colette\r\nBraeckman, who had the courage to denounce the plot\r\nagainst my country, as well as Chad, Gabon and many\r\nother African countries that publicly demonstrated their\r\nsupport and denounced this aggression.\r\nThe Assembly will agree with me that no honourable\r\nnation can allow its sovereignty and territorial integrity to\r\nbe called into question. The Congolese people will never\r\naccept subjugation, oppression or the imposition of\r\nperverse values such as a cultural genocide, which is so\r\nblithely tolerated by certain States.\r\nThe International Criminal Court whose Statute was\r\nsigned recently in Rome should get down to work and\r\nimmediately prosecute those who seek the destruction of\r\nhuman beings but who cover up their actions by making\r\ninnocent people take the blame.\r\nThe failure of the various appeals for a ceasefire\r\ncannot be blamed on the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. It is rather the result of the obstinacy, bad faith\r\nand cynicism of Rwanda and Uganda during the\r\nnegotiations held in Victoria Falls and in Addis Ababa.\r\nSince the first summit, held at Victoria Falls last\r\nAugust, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has\r\nindicated that implementation of the ceasefire was\r\ncontingent on the immediate, unconditional withdrawal\r\nfrom our national territory of foreign troops not invited by\r\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. I believe that the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council are obligated properly to implement the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Charter, in particular those of\r\nChapter VII, which envision action by the world\r\nOrganization with respect to threats to the peace, breaches\r\nof the peace, and acts of aggression.\r\nDespite the situation in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, our Government continues to abide by the\r\ntimetable leading to the democratization of our political\r\nlife. In that connection, I wish to inform the Assembly\r\nthat on 22 September 1998 our head of State signed Law\r\n122, relating to the organization and exercise of power in\r\nmy country. The new law grants the Constitutional\r\nCommission prerogatives allocated to the Constituent\r\nAssembly, finalizing the draft constitution to be the\r\nsubject of a referendum that will be organized early in\r\n1999.\r\nI reassure the international community that my\r\ncountry has noble aspirations and to date has granted no\r\nmaterial or military support whatsoever to the former\r\nRwandese Armed Forces, to the Interahamwe extremists,\r\nor much less to the Front pour la défense de la\r\ndémocratie, contrary to the campaign of slander and\r\nincitement waged by aggressors wishing to absolve\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 23 September 1998\r\nthemselves of the massacre of more than a thousand people\r\nin and around Kasika.\r\nI cannot conclude without speaking of the rebuilding\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo in particular and\r\nof the need for socio-economic development in Africa in\r\ngeneral; the continent continues to face crises of all kinds\r\nand is trying in vain to meet the challenge of recovery. In\r\nthis context, the role of the United Nations should not be\r\nlimited to accompanying Africa in implementing measures\r\nthat have been or will be adopted. Through capacity-\r\nbuilding, the United Nations system must translate into\r\nfact the organic partnership between itself and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity.\r\nIn the case of my country, the war imposed upon it\r\nby its neighbours has destroyed what remained of its\r\neconomic fabric, which had long suffered from the\r\neconomic mismanagement of the former dictatorship. That\r\nis why I appeal urgently to the United Nations and more\r\nspecifically to the “Friends of the Congo” — which at the\r\nBrussels conference decided to provide the assistance\r\nneeded to rebuild the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n— to contribute to the trust fund established for that\r\npurpose, with a view to helping in the economic recovery\r\nand the rebuilding of my country.\r\nI wish in conclusion to say that my country would\r\nappreciate enormously any action that the United Nations\r\nmight consider to prevail upon the Rwandese Republic to\r\nsign the non-aggression pact among the members of the\r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions in\r\nCentral Africa, and to establish democracy in Rwanda and\r\nUganda. For all my country’s problems are repercussions\r\nof the policy of non-democratization in Rwanda and in\r\nUganda. The international community would thus be\r\nperforming a useful task.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
