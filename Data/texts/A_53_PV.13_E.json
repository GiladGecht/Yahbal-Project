(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nNatural disasters in the Caribbean\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the members of the General Assembly and on my\r\nown behalf, I wish to express and convey to the\r\nGovernments and peoples of the countries of the Caribbean\r\nregion, which were recently struck by a devastating\r\nhurricane, incurring loss of lives and significant material\r\ndestruction, our most profound condolences on the tragic\r\ndeaths and damage. I also express the hope that the\r\ninternational community will display its solidarity by\r\nresponding rapidly, generously and effectively to the\r\nrequests for assistance from those countries in the current\r\ncrisis.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jacob Nena, President of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia.\r\nMr. Jacob Nena, President of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia, His Excellency Mr. Jacob\r\nNena, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nena: It is my high honour to address the\r\nAssembly today, both as the Chairman of the South\r\nPacific Forum and as the President of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia.\r\nFirst of all, Mr. President, for the South Pacific\r\nForum and for my country, I wish to express sincere\r\ncongratulations on your election to the highest position\r\none can hold in this body. We are confident that your\r\nstrong experience and leadership will provide the rudder\r\nthat is needed here to steer us safely through the many\r\nchallenges that lie ahead.\r\nI also thank the President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of\r\nUkraine, for his skilful guidance throughout the past year\r\nduring most difficult and troubling times.\r\nRecognition also must be given to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose tireless and effective\r\nwork in both leadership and coordinating roles is well\r\nknown to all of us.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia was honoured to\r\nhost the twenty-ninth summit of leaders of the South\r\nPacific Forum in Pohnpei on 24 and 25 August. As a\r\nresult, I have the privilege and heavy responsibility of\r\nreporting to this organ the consensus achieved by all 16\r\nmember countries of the Forum at that summit.\r\nThe South Pacific Forum is a unique institution\r\ninvolving independent and self-governing States which\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nshare a very special part of the world. Forum member\r\ncountries differ greatly in land area, ocean area, population,\r\nresource endowment, economic development and\r\nindustrialization, social structures, cultures and living\r\nstandards. However, we all share a common bond as Forum\r\nmembers and have established agreed positions on a wide\r\nrange of issues which transcend our diversity. We have also\r\nagreed to work together to pursue cohesion, stability and\r\nwell-being in our countries.\r\nAt the recent summit, the heads of Government and\r\nrepresentatives of the 16 member countries reviewed\r\nprogress and took decisions on a number of issues\r\nconsidered important to the region, which were generally of\r\na political, economic or environmental nature. I will\r\nmention briefly some of the subjects that were discussed\r\nand refer for further details to the Forum communiqué,\r\nwhich is to be issued as a document of this General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe overall theme of the Forum’s summit this year\r\nwas “From Reform to Growth: The Private Sector and\r\nInvestment as Keys to Prosperity”. In this regard, the\r\nForum agreed that efforts should be made to ensure\r\nmacroeconomic stability by improving fiscal discipline,\r\nfurther promoting public sector reforms and broadening the\r\ntax base. It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide\r\nrange of policy, legal, regulatory and institutional reforms\r\nwhich provide the private sector with a more favourable\r\nand competitive business environment.\r\nLeaders noted that good overall progress has been\r\nmade in the implementation of the Forum Economic Action\r\nPlan, which aims at strengthening the economies of the\r\nisland countries. This progress was made despite such\r\ndifficulties as capacity constraints facing some members,\r\nthe backdrop of region-specific difficulties, notably drought\r\nand other disasters, and the problems faced by member\r\ncountries on account of the Asian economic crisis. Specific\r\nrecommendations were endorsed concerning the region’s\r\nresponse to undesirable economic activities, the promotion\r\nof competitive telecommunications markets, the\r\ndevelopment of information infrastructure and work related\r\nto the Forum Free Trade Area.\r\nOn a related matter, the Forum revisited the objective\r\nof having the United Nations adopt a vulnerability index,\r\nwith the aim of having such an index included among the\r\ncriteria for determining least developed country status and\r\ndeciding eligibility for concessional aid and trade treatment.\r\nIt was noted with pleasure that the United Nations\r\nEconomic and Social Council had agreed to defer\r\nconsideration of Vanuatu’s graduation from least\r\ndeveloped country status for one year, pending further\r\nconsideration of the vulnerability index issue, and that the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\r\nhave created a task force on the subject. While these steps\r\nhave been important, much work remains ahead to gain\r\nfull international recognition of vulnerability in its various\r\nmanifestations as obstacles to the sustainable development\r\nof small island developing States.\r\nThe Forum solidly reaffirmed its previous\r\nendorsement of the Barbados Programme of Action for\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates as a comprehensive framework with great potential\r\nfor the region, and noted the efforts under way for its\r\nimplementation, but that much remains unaddressed. It is\r\nbelieved that the special session of the General Assembly\r\nin 1999 to review the Plan of Action will represent an\r\nimportant opportunity for the region. Support was\r\nexpressed for national, regional and transregional\r\nactivities in the run-up to the special session, both to\r\nbetter position ourselves for effective participation and to\r\nraise pre-sessional awareness of the situation of small\r\nisland developing States.\r\nOne issue that received a great deal of attention at\r\nthis year’s Forum summit was that of global climate\r\nchange, and in particular the risk of sea level rise brought\r\non or hastened by human activities affecting the\r\natmosphere. The Forum’s membership includes two annex\r\nI parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change. All the rest, including several which are\r\nnot United Nations Members, are small island developing\r\ncountries and committed members of the Alliance of\r\nSmall Island States (AOSIS). We are driven in that regard\r\nby deep concerns about our very survival.\r\nIt was encouraging and perhaps indicative to others\r\nthat despite a wide diversity of interests on this issue the\r\nForum succeeded in reaching a comprehensive position.\r\nThe Forum recognized the legally binding commitments\r\nagreed to in the Kyoto Protocol as a significant first step\r\nforward on the path of ensuring effective global action to\r\ncombat climate change. The Forum encouraged all\r\ncountries to sign the Kyoto Protocol and to work towards\r\nits earliest possible ratification. In particular, noting that\r\nthe Framework Convention obliges developed country\r\nparties to take the lead in combating climate change and\r\nthe adverse effects thereof, the Forum stressed the\r\nimportance of implementing measures to ensure early\r\nprogress towards meeting the commitments in the Kyoto\r\nProtocol. This applies particularly to the United States,\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation, Japan, Canada\r\nand other annex I emitters.\r\nThe Forum called for substantial progress at the\r\nupcoming fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Framework Convention in Buenos Aires in establishing\r\nthe rules for international implementation mechanisms —\r\nparticularly emissions trading, the clean development\r\nmechanism and joint implementation — to ensure that these\r\nmechanisms assist the effectiveness of greenhouse-gas\r\nreduction efforts.\r\nIt was also noted that an effective global response to\r\nthe problem of climate change will require ongoing active\r\ncooperation and strengthened action by all parties, taking\r\naccount of their common but differentiated responsibilities\r\nand their respective capabilities. The Forum stressed the\r\nurgent need to initiate a process to develop procedures and\r\nfuture time-frames for wider global participation in\r\nemissions limitation and reduction in which significant\r\ndeveloping country emitters would enter into commitments\r\nwhich reflect their individual national circumstances and\r\ndevelopment needs. But remember, developed countries\r\nmust take the lead.\r\nThe Forum noted with relief and gratitude the\r\nrecognition in the Kyoto Protocol of the importance of the\r\nadaption needs of small island States. The leaders called for\r\nadequate resources to be generated through the\r\nimplementation mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol and the\r\nGlobal Environment Facility for the full range of adaption\r\nmeasures. The Forum countries anticipate maximizing the\r\nbenefits to them from such implementation measures and\r\nmechanisms through the work of another regional\r\norganization, the South Pacific Regional Environment\r\nProgramme.\r\nRespectful of the wide range of reactions and emotions\r\nsurrounding the outcome of Kyoto, and recognizing also the\r\ndifficult challenges that will face the delegates at Buenos\r\nAires, it is suggested that the Forum consensus should be\r\ntaken as a harbinger of the possibilities for finding common\r\nground on a larger playing field — one on which the\r\nultimate fate of all of us may be decided.\r\nBefore I leave the subject of climate change, I would\r\nlike to express gratitude to the donor nations that responded\r\nrecently to the suffering visited upon Pacific island peoples\r\nby the climatic phenomenon of El Niño. Whether or not\r\nscientists can decide conclusively that the recent intensity\r\nof the El Niño effect is a symptom of global climate\r\nchange, it is a fact that entire island populations found\r\nthemselves in a situation where their very survival\r\ndepended on the willingness of other countries to provide\r\nemergency assistance. We will always be thankful that\r\nsuch assistance was forthcoming.\r\nWhile we express our appreciation, we are also\r\nmindful of the situation of the devastation that has been\r\ncreated by Hurricane Georges in the southern United\r\nStates, and we are hoping and praying that this\r\nphenomenon will pass, giving relief to the people.\r\nAnother issue of immediate and continuing\r\nenvironmental concern to our Forum region is the\r\nongoing practice by industrialized Powers of shipping\r\nradioactive wastes back and forth through our economic\r\nzones in the advancement of their own national interests\r\nand priorities, irrespective of our strenuous and continuing\r\nprotests. The Forum noted that some strides have been\r\nmade in exchanging information on these shipments, but\r\nthe risks remain. At the very minimum, we continue to\r\nseek a strong regime of prior notification to and\r\nconsultation with coastal States on planned shipments of\r\nhazardous wastes, and the development of a regime to\r\ncompensate the region for actual economic losses caused\r\nto tourism, fisheries and other affected industries in the\r\narea.\r\nThe Forum leaders could not help but note with\r\nalarm the recent tests of nuclear devices by India and\r\nPakistan. They expressed grave concern that the recent\r\nnuclear tests constitute a threat to the international process\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty. It will be recalled that the region encompassed by\r\nthe Forum members has perhaps greater standing than any\r\nother region in the world to express alarm over the\r\ncontinued testing of nuclear devices. The Forum members\r\nhave endured and continue to endure the human suffering\r\nthat has resulted from the curse of nuclear proliferation\r\nand testing. The Pacific island countries are taking action\r\nwithin the region to counter the presence of nuclear\r\nweapons and the testing of nuclear devices through the\r\nSouth Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. We call upon the\r\nUnited States to ratify that Treaty.\r\nFinally, as regards the South Pacific Forum — and\r\nI stress that I do not mention here every issue that was\r\ndiscussed or covered in the communiqué — I want to\r\nrelate the Forum’s pleasure in drawing attention to the\r\nsigning of the Noumea Accord between the Government\r\nof France and the concerned parties in New Caledonia.\r\nThis Accord represents a tremendous accomplishment by\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nall involved in moving forward the process of self-\r\ndetermination for New Caledonia, whatever the ultimate\r\noutcome of that process might be.\r\nI have already consumed much of my time in\r\ncommenting on issues that concern the South Pacific Forum\r\nas a group. Briefly now, I ask that you focus your attention\r\non the situation of my small island developing country.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is approaching the\r\nend of the millennium with a sense of unsettlement. We\r\nwill be among the first to celebrate the beginning of the\r\nnew epoch, but, in an immediate sense, what does this\r\ncelebration promise for us? Our developmental process\r\nbegan only a few years ago, and the barriers we face in\r\nterms of need for technology and manpower development,\r\nscarcity of resources, our remote location and small\r\npopulation — to name only a few — are beyond our\r\ncapability to overcome alone.\r\nWe are indeed fortunate to be receiving substantial\r\nassistance from the United States and other bilateral\r\npartners, but our long-term future cannot and should not\r\ndepend upon bilateral assistance. Perhaps it is not realistic\r\nfor us to plan for complete self-sufficiency, but we do want\r\nto become, and we must become, more self-reliant.\r\nWe in the Federated States of Micronesia have some\r\nconcerns that the emphasis of effort in the United Nations\r\nis being somewhat drawn away from the balance between\r\naddressing the overall interests of all countries and at the\r\nsame time particularly assisting developing countries to\r\nmove towards their rightful condition. In other words, we\r\nfear that the traditional role of the Organization in assisting\r\nless advanced countries with their development could be\r\nmarginalized. I use the phrase “drawn away” because the\r\nshift to which I refer would not be something that leaders\r\nsat down and purposefully decided on. In large part, given\r\nthe breadth of the Charter, the United Nations is simply in\r\ndanger of becoming overwhelmed by its responsibilities. As\r\nregional and national conflicts proliferate, drug trafficking\r\nflourishes, terrorism looms as an ever more dangerous part\r\nof our daily lives, and as the global environment becomes\r\nincreasingly threatened, the demands on the time and\r\nresources of this body and its Members to confront\r\nimmediate problems are compelling.\r\nBut while the need to move towards a closer parity\r\nbetween the living standards of the North and the South\r\nnecessitates long-term solutions, it cannot be forgotten that\r\nin the long term the accomplishment of that goal will do\r\nmuch to address the problems to which I have just\r\nreferred, which seem beyond the reach of immediate solutions.\r\nMeanwhile, as developing countries, we too must do\r\nour part. We must create the flexible, though outward-\r\noriented, economies that can maximize the benefits of the\r\nglobal economy in which we also exist. At the same time,\r\nwe must not forget that our national identities and unique\r\nnational and subnational social, political and economic\r\nsituations demand a proactive approach that avoids\r\nblindly jumping on the bandwagon of the latest\r\ndevelopment initiatives in order to reap the perceived\r\nbenefits of donor assistance. In realizing that mistakes\r\ninevitably are made and opportunities lost, we must not\r\nlose our sense of self-confidence or permit ourselves to\r\nbecome overly prone to accepting the dictates of well-\r\nmeaning donor partners whose understanding of our\r\nsituation may not be complete.\r\nBut we must also remain very alert to the need for\r\ncourse correction and we must endure periods of\r\nstructural, institutional and even behavioural change. The\r\nprocess is now ongoing in my country. With the\r\nassistance of the Asian Development Bank and donor\r\npartners, we are well along in implementing a two-\r\npronged programme that involves Government and public\r\nenterprise reforms, on the one hand, and private sector\r\nreforms, on the other. On the Government side, we are\r\nreorganizing and downsizing our institutions and\r\nimproving our tax structure in order to move along the\r\nadjustment path to sustainable finances and rational\r\nservice levels. On the private sector side, our reforms are\r\ndesigned to improve the economic environment for\r\nprivate sector growth, especially in those productive\r\nactivities that earn dollars from abroad. This means,\r\namong other things, reducing the role of Government in\r\nproductive activities and restructuring our legal and\r\nregulatory environment to encourage private sector\r\nactivity and investment, especially foreign investment.\r\nDespite our determination to carry through this\r\neffort, we know that it alone will not produce\r\ndevelopment. It will facilitate development and make our\r\napplication of development assistance far more effective.\r\nBut now, perhaps more than ever, we will require the\r\npatience, understanding and continued support of donor\r\npartners and international institutions, which have been so\r\ninstrumental in helping us to reach this point.\r\nThis is to be a session during which two very\r\nimportant anniversaries are celebrated: 50 years of United\r\nNations peacekeeping and 50 years of the Universal\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. As to the first, I wish to\r\nhonour those who served in the peacekeeping operations of\r\nthe past 50 years, especially those who lost their lives in\r\nthe service of the United Nations. As to the second, the\r\nvital role played by the Declaration hardly needs my\r\nendorsement; but I would refer to my statement at the 1993\r\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights, when, in\r\nspeaking with respect to those who have given their lives\r\nin the cause of human rights, I said:\r\n“Those very heroes would be among the first to say,\r\n\u0027Let’s look into the past only for what we can learn\r\nfrom it. The job is not yet done, and our enemy grows\r\nstronger.\u0027”\r\nIt only remains for me to refer to the activities of the\r\ninternational community and this body having to do with\r\nmy country’s predominant resource — the ocean. This is\r\nthe International Year of the Ocean. The world can little\r\nafford to miss the opportunities presented by this occasion\r\nto focus on our planet’s most prevalent yet least understood\r\nphysical mechanism. The single best example of that\r\ndangerously incomplete understanding surely is the ocean-\r\ngenerated, worldwide disaster of El Niño, which occurred,\r\nironically, this year.\r\nFor obvious reasons, the peoples of Micronesia\r\nsecured involvement in the long negotiations that led to the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea even\r\nbefore we emerged from Trusteeship status. We have\r\ncontinued that involvement as a party to the Convention\r\nand now call on all States to ratify the Convention and\r\nparticipate fully in the process. We support the Tribunal for\r\nthe Law of the Sea, as well as resolutions aimed at\r\neradicating the practice of driftnet fishing and unauthorized\r\nfishing in areas of national jurisdiction. We urge action to\r\nreduce by-catches, fish discards and post-harvest losses.\r\nLooking towards the Assembly’s special session on the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action, and also towards next\r\nyear’s consideration of oceans by the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development, we encourage the recognition of\r\nlinkages between the various related issues and the need for\r\nmore integrated treatment. By necessity, I speak of linkages\r\nand integration, which are familiar terms of usage within\r\nthe United Nations system but there is nothing routine\r\nabout the devastations of El Niño that were visited upon my\r\ncountry’s people earlier this year and upon other peoples\r\naround the world. I can think of no better example of the\r\nneed for the recognition of linkages in terms of ocean and\r\nclimatic issues and the necessity for the application of\r\nintegrated response measures.\r\nIn closing, I should like to refer to the fact that, in\r\nrecent years, as the problems of our increasingly complex\r\nand globalized society appear to have escalated, it has\r\nbecome fashionable in some quarters to question whether\r\nthe United Nations Organization is worth maintaining. It\r\nis as though the world’s peoples expect that the worth of\r\nthis Organization is to be tested by its efficiency in\r\n“fixing” a set of global problems, after which,\r\npresumably, we would all live happily ever after. That\r\nmistaken notion is grounded in the assumption that\r\ninternational cooperation exists only for immediate\r\nproblem-solving.\r\nSpeaking for a relatively new Member country of the\r\nUnited Nations, allow me to suggest humbly that the\r\nrepetition of mistakes of whatever scale and the creation\r\nof new crises along with every step forward is elemental\r\nto the human condition. The Charter of this Organization,\r\nmonumental as it may be, is still a document designed by\r\nand for human beings on this planet and must be judged\r\nand applied in light of the human experience. The United\r\nNations should not be expected to work itself out of a\r\njob.\r\nThe people and the Government of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia deeply respect the past\r\naccomplishments of the United Nations and look forward\r\nto continuing to meet our commitments to it, even though\r\nour contributions may appear small.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Federated States of Micronesia for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jacob Nena, President of the Federated States\r\nof Micronesia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Roberto Flores Facusée,\r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Honduras\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras.\r\nMr. Carlos Roberto Flores Facusée, Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras, was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the Constitutional President\r\nof the Republic of Honduras, His Excellency Mr. Carlos\r\nRoberto Flores Facusée, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Flores Facusée (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I am pleased and honoured to convey a cordial\r\nand respectful greeting from the people and Government of\r\nthe Republic of Honduras and from the other countries that\r\nare members of the Central American Integration System,\r\nof which I am proud to be the current Chairman.\r\nMr. President, Central America wishes to express its\r\nsatisfaction at your well-deserved election to preside over\r\nthis fifty-third regular session of the General Assembly.\r\nYour outstanding professional and public career is a\r\nguarantee that this session of the Assembly will yield\r\nfruitful and significant results.\r\nOur delegation wishes also to express its gratitude to\r\nthe representative of the Ukraine, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\r\nfor the commendable work he did during the last General\r\nAssembly. We also express our sincerest gratitude to Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, who, in discharging his mandate as Secretary-\r\nGeneral of our Organization, has displayed a spirit of hard\r\nwork and dedication in a particularly difficult period for the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThroughout its history, Honduras has fought for the\r\nsystem of democratic government to take root on its soil. It\r\nhas fought to take its place in the world community as a\r\nfully fledged State, to imbue its independent, republican\r\ncharacter with respect for basic human rights, and to ensure\r\npublic freedoms for all of its inhabitants. However, many\r\nof those efforts were frustrated at certain regrettable times\r\nin our past, a past that was closely interlinked with that of\r\nthe other States of the Central American region.\r\nFortunately, in recent decades Honduras has safeguarded\r\nand strengthened its democracy and its internal institutions,\r\nin spite of the deplorable and difficult circumstances\r\nexperienced by the Central American region as the\r\ninvoluntary theatre of the cold war, which was imposed on\r\nus from outside, and in spite of the undesirable\r\nconsequences of armed conflicts.\r\nThe Governments of Central America are currently\r\nworking hard to consolidate peace and a spirit of internal\r\nreconciliation in our societies. Our resolve is strong in this\r\nprocess, and the progress achieved is truly encouraging and\r\na just reward for these efforts. We are determined to turn\r\naway forever from the fratricidal battles that have caused us\r\nso much suffering and diverted our energy from the\r\nconstruction of the prosperous, democratic, free and\r\nhappy region that our peoples yearn for and that their\r\ndemocratic Governments strive to offer.\r\nIt must be said that although Honduras was not the\r\ndirect scene of Central American armed conflicts, it did\r\nsuffer the grave consequences of the instability,\r\nuncertainty and violence of the region, which caused\r\nthousands of Hondurans to emigrate to other countries,\r\nmainly to the United States. Unfortunately, justice has not\r\nbeen done to our compatriots, as they have not been given\r\nthe same opportunities and immigration status enjoyed by\r\nother Central Americans. We trust that the sacrifice of\r\nHonduras in the Central American conflicts of the past\r\nwill be fully understood and that our emigrants will be\r\ngiven the consideration that they justly deserve.\r\nFurthermore, the Presidents of Central America, in\r\nongoing consultations and regular meetings, are giving\r\nstrong impetus to regional integration in all fields:\r\neconomic, political, social and cultural. These dynamics\r\nof integration include the States of Belize, Panama and\r\nthe Dominican Republic, through broad participation\r\nmechanisms and the signing of economic treaties and of\r\nbilateral and multinational exchanges. We are hoping also\r\nfor a joint venture with the Mexican Republic, and we\r\nmaintain that the region as a whole must enjoy the same\r\nbenefits that the three principal North American countries\r\nhave already agreed upon for themselves.\r\nThe Government of Honduras commends the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and fully\r\nsupports his efforts to reform the Organization. There is\r\nconsensus in Central America on the fact that United\r\nNations reform, including broader membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, is a necessity for the international\r\nsystem. But this expansion must be based upon equitable\r\ngeographic representation and the consensus of the\r\nregional groups and the existing subregional mechanisms.\r\nThe restructuring must also include a procedural review\r\nin order to ensure greater representation, transparency and\r\nefficiency.\r\nThe Government of Honduras supports the initiative\r\nof the President of the United States to establish a\r\nworldwide organization to fight against terrorism. We\r\nstrongly condemn all types of terrorism without exception\r\nbecause we believe it is a form of human cruelty that no\r\npolitical, ideological, religious or cultural cause can\r\njustify at this stage of our civilization.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nOn the subject of controlling illegal drug trafficking,\r\nour Government reiterates its support for the special session\r\nof the General Assembly on the world drug problem.\r\nBecause of its strategic geographic position, Central\r\nAmerica is in danger of becoming a production and trade\r\narea for narcotic drugs and must therefore receive the\r\ngreatest possible international support to fight this scourge.\r\nWe are pleased also at the advances achieved by the\r\nDiplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the\r\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court, held in\r\nRome, whose goal was to create a legal forum with global\r\njurisdiction in order to bring to trial and convict individuals\r\nfor war crimes and crimes against humanity.\r\nThe Honduran people themselves have suffered from\r\nthe use of anti-personnel mines, which have taken a high\r\ntoll in human lives. Consequently, we are prepared to\r\nsupport the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction. The Government of\r\nHonduras is proud to announce that today it has deposited\r\nwith the Secretary-General its instrument of ratification of\r\nthe landmines Convention.\r\nThe countries of the Central American Region view\r\nwith concern and deplore the recent nuclear tests conducted\r\nin other geographical regions, and we advocate the\r\nintroduction and full implementation of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as an important step towards the\r\ntotal elimination of these devastating weapons.\r\nHonduras supports the efforts of the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan for full membership in the United Nations and\r\nin the international agencies of the United Nations system.\r\nWe are convinced that conditions have changed\r\nsignificantly and that at this time in our history there can be\r\nno justification for the international isolation to which more\r\nthan 21 million people are subjected.\r\nAmong other noteworthy issues is the advancement of\r\nwomen in society. We welcome this advancement not only\r\nbecause women have the right to equality, but also because\r\nwith their help we can envision a fairer and more humane\r\nworld. We invite States to support the Platform for Action\r\nin the effective implementation of the Fourth World\r\nConference on Women.\r\nLikewise, because children and adolescents are the\r\nmost vulnerable members of society, we are prepared to\r\nlend our vigorous support to the convening of a world\r\nconference of ministers responsible for youth, with a view\r\nto the implementation of national programmes and of the\r\nWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000\r\nand Beyond, and in order to support the institutions and\r\nprogrammes designed to safeguard our children and\r\nyoung people as the generational and spiritual reserve of\r\nour homeland.\r\nGlobalization is a subject of particular concern that\r\nmust be tackled in this unique forum — so vital to\r\nhumankind — because it gives rise to challenges of an\r\nunprecedented magnitude.\r\nIt is true that humankind has always faced singular\r\nchallenges throughout the millennium that is now drawing\r\nto a close. Major worldwide events have occurred that\r\nhave drastically changed the way of life of millions of\r\npeople: the Christian revolution, in the spiritual realm; the\r\nliberal revolutions of France and the United States, in the\r\npolitical realm; the Industrial Revolution, in the economic\r\nrealm; and the Russian Revolution, in the social realm.\r\nEach of these historic events affected in a different way\r\nhumankind’s self-image and the role of States in\r\ngoverning society.\r\nThus, the twentieth century — which saw great\r\nachievements, serious errors, titanic efforts, enormous\r\nupheavals and profuse bloodshed — is now drawing to a\r\nclose. We are about to open a new chapter for\r\nhumankind, one that is replete with uncertainty,\r\nexpectations, fears and hopes — the first century of the\r\napproaching third millennium.\r\nThe twentieth century will bequeath to future\r\ngenerations a legacy without parallel or comparison in the\r\nhistory of human development. This is the century that\r\ntook us to the very depth of the microcosmos through the\r\nsplitting of the atom and the deciphering of the genetic\r\ncode, allowing us to unravel the components of matter\r\nand discover and use an impressive number of new and\r\neven-made elements with the help of innovative formulas\r\nfor nuclear energy, light, heat and sound. It has been a\r\ncentury of great discoveries in all the sciences —\r\nmathematics, physics, medicine, chemistry, optics,\r\ngenetics, psychology and electronics.\r\nThis is the century of the outer space and man’s\r\ndaring probes and adventures of man beyond his planet.\r\nThis is the century of vertiginous speeds that broke the\r\nsound barrier and of communications and transport that\r\nhave, indeed, transformed the earth into a global village.\r\nIt is the century of universal cybernetic information,\r\nwhich has connected man with his neighbour in the other\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nhemisphere, just as two friends used to talk in their back\r\nyards, separated only by a garden fence. Today, the\r\ncomputer performs tasks that would have taken the most\r\ncultivated and talented man centuries of work, or that he\r\nwould have never been able to perform. Races and cultures\r\nhave been mixed, influencing each other in an unceasing\r\nexchange of creations. There has been a massive spreading\r\nof ideas, news, customs and new developments such as man\r\nnever dreamed of accomplishing in the course of his long\r\nand trying existence on earth. This is the century of\r\ngeopolitical changes, as sudden as they are unimaginable,\r\nso huge that their very force left their own protagonists\r\nbehind.\r\nUnfortunately, it is also a century that will be\r\nremembered with sadness, as the century of the two great\r\nworldwide slaughters and many dreadful, apparently local\r\nand centralized, wars. It is the century of thermonuclear,\r\ntoxic and chemical weapons and other means of mass\r\ndestruction. It is the century of merciless, senseless\r\nterrorism, and also the century of the terrible AIDS\r\npandemic. It is the century, finally, of man’s greatest\r\ndestruction of the ecology and of the purity of his\r\nenvironment, seriously threatening the very existence of his\r\nplanet. We are concerned, and we are surely ashamed, that\r\nthis century will also be remembered as the century of the\r\ndirest poverty in an alarming majority of countries. We are\r\ngrieved that when there is prosperity, it is concentrated\r\namong the richest, but when there is a crisis, on the other\r\nhand, its devastation is brought down on the poorest.\r\nBut if there is one issue that characterizes this century\r\nand for ever marks it in the annals of the human race, it is\r\nthe desire for, the necessity of and the value of freedom.\r\nNever have we fought so hard and paid such a high price\r\nfor freedom, or for the lack thereof, as we have done in this\r\ncentury. Never have there been so many attempts to destroy\r\nfreedom through systems, ideologies, regimes and wars, and\r\nnever has man carried out such monumental exploits, such\r\nbeautiful and heroic deeds, in the defence or pursuit of\r\nliberty, as in the last 10 decades of this millennium. The\r\ngreat figures that left their mark on contemporary history\r\nare those who denied freedom to their nations or achieved\r\nit gloriously, sometimes at the cost of their own lives.\r\nThank God that we can say at this time, and in this\r\nworld forum, that freedom has triumphed and will continue\r\nto establish itself in every corner of the world where it is\r\nstill denied or crushed, whenever conditions show our\r\npeoples that freedom, an essential human value, is worth\r\nthe trouble and that to fight for it and to keep it are\r\nimportant for man’s physical and spiritual well-being.\r\nAlong with freedom, democracy is triumphing\r\naround the globe, but for this progress to continue to be\r\neffective and to last, so that we do not lose what we have\r\ngained and do not return to the tyrannies we defeated\r\nwith so much effort and suffering, certain conditions must\r\nbe fulfilled. This is the huge challenge of the next\r\nmillennium: how to keep this freedom, how to extend it\r\nto the farthest corner of the planet and — the final test —\r\nhow to manage it for the benefit of all humankind.\r\nIt is true that, just as there are hopeful and\r\nencouraging expectations on which we must capitalize,\r\nthere is also a lot of worry, and even fear, in our nations\r\nconcerning these swift, radical and dizzying universal\r\nchanges. The world economy has progressed and\r\ndeveloped dramatically in the last 25 years. Economic\r\nglobalization has opened up opportunities and risks for all\r\nthe countries of the world. However, at this time it is\r\nquite clear that the benefits of globalization are not shared\r\nby all countries and that, in many cases, there is an\r\nincreasing disparity between developed and developing\r\ncountries, an inequality that produces social and political\r\ntensions in our countries and severely threatens the\r\ndemocratic advances for which we have paid so dearly.\r\nIn the beginning of the process of global\r\nliberalization, it was maintained that the reduction in the\r\nflows of assistance for development would be far\r\noutweighed by the commercial benefits and private capital\r\nflows to our regions. The truth is that, even though we\r\nsupport commercial liberalization with concrete measures,\r\nour products have often been faced with various kinds of\r\nbarriers that are hard to overcome.\r\nIn combination, factors such as the reduction in\r\ndevelopment assistance, barriers to the export of our\r\nproducts, the scanty movement of private capital or its\r\nexcessive concentration in certain areas, and the burden\r\nof foreign debt become formidable obstacles to the\r\neconomic growth and social development of our peoples.\r\nI believe the time is ripe to evaluate what is happening at\r\nthe global level in order to take measures that will\r\nprevent further deterioration of the living conditions of\r\nour population and promote a more just economic and\r\nsocial order.\r\nThis concern is especially legitimate in the light of\r\nfinancial developments in recent days in certain countries\r\nof South-East Asia and Japan. Those economies and\r\nsystems were held up to us as an example to follow and\r\nas a standard for what can be achieved with full economic\r\nliberalization. Russia followed that path that led to the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\ncrisis affecting us today, which we all hope is temporary.\r\nAll of this means that the economy is not everything, and\r\nthat a setback in maintaining the welfare level of a people’s\r\nwell-being because of economic and financial mechanisms\r\ncan rapidly deteriorate its political and social conditions,\r\npresenting the imminent danger of moving backwards in the\r\ndevelopment of democracy and imperilling once again the\r\nprecious gift of freedom, for which millions of men and\r\nwomen have given their lives in this century. Creating great\r\nexpectations and exaggerated hopes of well-being and\r\ndevelopment is dangerous, as are the disappointments that\r\ncan be felt by our peoples when the democratic system and\r\nthe new economic order are incapable of giving concrete\r\nanswers to the basic needs of our nations. This is the risk\r\nof backlash, the reversal of conquests and the return to\r\ninstability, rivalry, mistrust and the loss of internal, and\r\neven international, peace.\r\nUnder the pressure of globalization, modernization and\r\neconomic adjustments, we have surely put at stake millions\r\nof the planet’s inhabitants’ right to better life especially in\r\nLatin America. At stake is the national identity of countries\r\nand the identity of regions faced with an increasingly rapid\r\nprocess of universalization and assimilation, which is not\r\nalways laudable. At stake is the vulnerability or resistance\r\nof our societies before the avalanche of influences,\r\nrequirements and models imposed from the outside, behind\r\nthe mask of structural adjustments and modernization. At\r\nstake is stability: we are faced with the massive\r\ndevelopment of violent, or simply rebellious, acts of the\r\npoor, the marginalized and the excluded, because they feel\r\npowerless before the walls that prevent their access to\r\nsurvival, work, education, health and safety, which are\r\nessential, basic rights, amply consecrated by the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary we\r\nHondurans have celebrated with the greatest pleasure and\r\nwith renewed hope that such principles can actually lead us\r\nto fairer, happier societies.\r\nWe cannot hide the fear, shared by many of the\r\nGovernments represented here, that a new economic order\r\nthat is unfair, oversized and all-encompassing, and that does\r\nnot take into consideration the political and social realities\r\nof each country and the processes that led us to these\r\nvertiginous changes, would destroy any possibility for the\r\nequitable development of each person and each people, to\r\nthe extent that globalization generates excessive\r\nconcentrations of power in large and monstrous\r\nconsortiums, instead of solidarity in the enjoyment of the\r\ngoods and opportunities afforded by a new, universal\r\nsociety.\r\nWhether we are moving towards an ideal, globalized,\r\nfraternal and peaceful world of solidarity, or towards\r\nother forms of tyranny, submission and cruelty — this is\r\nthe question we must ask, all of us who have public\r\nresponsibilities in Honduras and in every corner of the\r\nplanet. In a world where the borders no longer divide\r\ncountries, but rather swell to embrace the geographic\r\ncontours of the planet, in a world in which the scope of\r\ninternational relations is limited only by human ambition\r\nand imagination, the question is whether we are heading\r\nfor the globalization of ethics or an ethics of\r\nglobalization. This question must be answered if we are\r\nto avoid the death, in the vortex of capital and market\r\ngrowth, of humankind’s ethical and moral values, which\r\nhave been the pillars that prevent the crumbling of what\r\nwe all call civilization.\r\nAt issue, in short, is the ability to govern societies,\r\nbut without losing the freedoms that gave birth to States,\r\nand without losing the ethical values that have kept them\r\nalive, sheltered by eternal concepts such as national\r\nsovereignty, basic human rights, the survival of the planet\r\nand the self-determination of peoples.\r\nAfter all, in the hierarchy of the values that define\r\nour highest aspirations, the supreme goal of society and\r\nState continues to be the human person, and the supreme\r\ngood we are trying to achieve is not growth, not\r\ndevelopment, not globalization, but happiness and well-\r\nbeing.\r\nThis is the right time, then, to seek alternatives such\r\nas the needed reinforcement of multilateral institutions\r\nwith funds on preferential terms to support development;\r\nincreased cooperation in order to foster better\r\nopportunities for those most in need and to reduce\r\nimbalances and close the distance between the richest and\r\nthe poorest; the governing of globalization so that it does\r\nnot demand sacrifices from most nations while\r\nconcentrating its benefits in a few; and the search for\r\nadditional, expeditious mechanisms to reduce the foreign\r\ndebt that is choking most of humankind. The United\r\nNations must become the appropriate forum to foster\r\nthese and other initiatives required to guarantee better\r\nconditions for developing countries, intelligent measures\r\nto ensure universal peace and harmony.\r\nHonduras, its people and its Government, declare\r\ntheir faith in the superior qualities of man and his\r\ncapacity for hope and faith in a better destiny for all\r\nhumankind. We are sure that the unity of all the peoples\r\nof the earth around the essential topics of peace, survival\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nof the planet, a worldwide economic system that is more\r\nbalanced and really open to all and the construction of\r\nsocieties that are fairer, freer, and safer will remain the\r\nraison d’être of the United Nations and its most important\r\ntask. In this effort, the Organization can count on the\r\nsupport and solidarity of Honduras and other Central\r\nAmerican States.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Honduras for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Carlos Roberto Flores Facusée, Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Rafael Caldera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Venezuela\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Venezuela.\r\nMr. Rafael Caldera, President of the Republic of\r\nVenezuela, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Venezuela, His Excellency Mr. Rafael Caldera,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Caldera (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nPlease accept my sincere congratulations, Sir, on your\r\nelection. I am convinced that your solid academic\r\nbackground and valuable experience as a statesman will\r\nserve your country, Uruguay, well, and will strengthen\r\nLatin America’s image.\r\nI also congratulate the Secretary-General on the\r\nexcellent report he submitted to the General Assembly at\r\nthis fifty-third session. It is a document rich in profound\r\nanalysis and noteworthy proposals for these new times.\r\nI am speaking on behalf of Venezuela before the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations at a time when my\r\nGovernment’s term is drawing to a close, in just a few\r\nmonths. Venezuela’s words are candid and sincere, for we\r\nare ever at the ready to make our modest but solid\r\ncontribution to the establishment of stable friendship and an\r\neffective and durable peace among all the peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe century that is drawing to a close has left a deep\r\nimprint on human history. Two gigantic wars nearly put\r\nan end to our civilization’s impressive progress and,\r\nabove all, to the respect for human rights that is\r\nfundamental to all progress. An unparalleled revolution\r\nseemed destined to change decisively the face and destiny\r\nof the world, and the end of that revolution was the most\r\nstriking and fortunate surprise the world has ever seen.\r\nThe world war that started in 1914 revealed to the\r\nhorror-stricken eyes of the world the human capacity for\r\nevil and destruction. But it was followed by two decades\r\nof lavishness and squandering that made people forget the\r\nroot causes of the conflagration. The attempt to create a\r\nLeague of Nations awakened ideals and showed the way,\r\nbut it disintegrated when the thunder of cannons\r\nannounced the outbreak of the Second World War. The\r\nsubsequent post-war era, enriched by the bitter lessons of\r\nexperience, encouraged by suffering and inspired by the\r\nideals of peace and liberty, lived for five decades under\r\nthe threat of nuclear war. The terrible catastrophe\r\npredicted as the inevitable result of the so-called cold war\r\nremained at the forefront of the world’s concerns until the\r\nmemorable fall of the Berlin Wall, which opened the new\r\nera in which humanity now finds itself.\r\nFor half a century peacekeeping has been a difficult\r\nand sometimes agonizing task. Faith in ideals was not\r\nenough to resolve the problems; what was needed was the\r\nwill and firm purpose, illuminated by experience.\r\nThe United Nations has undoubtedly played a very\r\nimportant role in this peacekeeping task, despite all the\r\ndeficiencies and errors it could be accused of. It has been\r\nthe irreplaceable forum where all countries could talk to\r\neach other, where all ideologies, all ethnic groups, all\r\npolitical systems, could meet, without losing sight of the\r\ngoal of encouraging and fostering freedom everywhere\r\nand of practising and promoting, by all legal means\r\npossible, the democratic system, the only system that is\r\ntruly compatible with respect for human rights and the\r\nfree competition of all to govern. The Organization has\r\nmanaged to keep its respected position, and today we\r\nhope to be able to strengthen it further so as to work\r\nfirmly together to confront the new problems and\r\nrealities, something that will require ever greater efforts.\r\nThe century that is coming to an end has also been\r\na time of incredible transformations. Air travel, which had\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nbeen the dream of a few visionaries, has become an\r\neveryday reality, and each hour thousands of people fly in\r\nand out of airports around the globe. The great adventure\r\nof space exploration has now left progress in air travel\r\nbehind, starting with man’s travels to the moon.\r\nThe very nature of the planet we live on has been the\r\nobject of comparisons that take us across infinite distances\r\nin our thoughts about the basic nature of the universe. The\r\nposition of our solar system and the global unity we live in,\r\nin relation to the whole cosmos, is a subject we are trying\r\nmore and more to define and penetrate.\r\nFurthermore, in just a few short years, compared with\r\nthe span of history, the communications revolution has\r\nmade the world more unified, more interdependent, more in\r\nneed of standards and systems that cannot be imposed by\r\nthe most powerful, but must be the result of consensus,\r\nwith respect for each individual’s identity and right to life.\r\nIn today’s society we are fully conscious of the\r\ninfinite presence of what is large, but we also have a\r\nprecise idea of the importance of what is infinitely small.\r\nThe technological revolution has not left an iota of\r\nknowledge untouched by its transforming impact. And those\r\nwho cultivate thought, pure science and art laboriously\r\nsearch for new avenues, driven by a zeal that arises from\r\nthe progress already achieved in changing mankind’s way\r\nof life.\r\nWe strongly favour the Secretary-General’s plans for\r\nreform of the Organization. We are convinced that the\r\nSecurity Council must be enlarged. The establishment of\r\nthe International Criminal Court represents an important\r\nstep in the juridical life of the international community. The\r\nfight against drug trafficking and terrorism increasingly\r\nrequires that the international community become its centre\r\nof coordination. These are delicate and demanding problems\r\nthat cannot be left to the individual actions of States,\r\nhowever powerful. The international community therefore\r\nfaces an arduous task.\r\nThe fight against poverty has been one of the most\r\nimportant aspects of international action in the last few\r\nyears. The World Summit for Social Development reflected\r\none of the priority concerns of the United Nations. The\r\nongoing activities of specialized agencies and the projects\r\nof the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nmark out a clear path in the search for a solution to this\r\nproblem, a path that must be extended over the whole\r\nsurface of the Earth. We know full well that peace, true\r\npeace, stable and permanent peace, requires justice, and that\r\njustice is most truly expressed in social justice. This was\r\nrecognized by the victorious countries in the Treaty of\r\nVersailles at the end of the First World War, and it was\r\nalso expressed in the Declaration of Philadelphia of 1944\r\nby the belligerents about to triumph in the Second World\r\nWar. The fight against poverty is ever more necessary\r\nand urgent, for the market economy and the current\r\nglobalization process cannot on their own respond to the\r\ndemands that social problems make on world leaders.\r\nIn addition to its positive aspects and the progress it\r\nundeniably entails, the complex phenomenon we have\r\ncome to call globalization can also have progressively\r\nnegative effects on the emerging developing countries.\r\nFaced with the world’s present imbalance, we must\r\ntherefore make a special point of emphasizing the harmful\r\neffects of international financial speculation. The balance\r\nof terror imposed by the cold war has been replaced by\r\na lack of financial discipline, by ruthless speculation that\r\nis alien to the values of solidarity and ethics that should\r\nprevail even in technology’s most sophisticated advances.\r\nThe poorest countries are the traumatized victims of this\r\nreality, but the whole world community may be\r\nthreatened by this situation that will affect even the\r\nadvanced countries. No one can escape the consequences\r\nof this situation. I therefore believe that today’s\r\ninternational agenda must concentrate on this critical\r\npoint, giving it priority over other objectives that, though\r\nalso important, must give way to this indispensable\r\nmatter.\r\nMy country’s delegation to the United Nations has\r\nset forth, first to the Group of 77 and then to the General\r\nAssembly, the need to call a special meeting to study the\r\nfinancing of developing countries. If financial assistance\r\nto the developing countries is not addressed on a priority\r\nbasis, if the necessary resources are not forthcoming from\r\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as\r\nwell as other agencies dealing with the basic aims of\r\ndevelopment, globalization will not be as successful as we\r\ncould hope it to be.\r\nThe effects of the Asian crisis on Latin America\r\nhave resulted in the weakening of some currencies, a\r\nsignificant downturn in the capital markets, rising internal\r\ninterest rates, restrictions to the obtention of external\r\ncredits and a rapid increase in the risk factors for many\r\nemerging countries.\r\nThe visible effects of the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization have demonstrated the imperfections of the\r\ninternational financial and monetary system, which has\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nrecently been characterized by, inter alia, the sharp impact\r\nof the participation of powerful financial groups and the\r\ndecisive actions of certain parties, such as the agencies that\r\nassess risk, certain of which have become a worse threat\r\nthan the terrible forces of other times. The time is ripe to\r\nencourage a better understanding between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, all equally affected by financial\r\ninstability. Venezuela believes that financial and monetary\r\nissues must have a permanent place on the agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations system. To that end, the exchange of ideas\r\nbetween the Organization and the international financial\r\ninstitutions that make up the Bretton Woods system must be\r\nencouraged and strengthened.\r\nFundamentally, globalization will depend on the\r\nbalance between rich and poor, between the more advanced,\r\nthe intermediately advanced and the least developed\r\nnations, and on the application of equitable formulas to\r\nalleviate the external debt burden referred to by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report.\r\nAt the end of the twentieth century, there is no more\r\nimportant objective than to steer the concern of the\r\ninternational community in this direction. If measures are\r\nnot taken to put an end to the abuses of what His Holiness\r\nJohn Paul II called savage capitalism, which gives rise,\r\nwith its excessive desire for profit, to unstable situations\r\nthat are transmitted with vertiginous speed to all the world’s\r\neconomic centres, we will have replaced the fear of nuclear\r\nwar with the threat of an economic and social catastrophe.\r\nIt is my view that in today’s globalized world, one of\r\nthe primary commitments of the community of nations,\r\nworking through and coordinated by the United Nations, is\r\nto strengthen its resolve to prevent and correct unacceptable\r\nimbalances, and to ensure the awareness and capacity of the\r\ninternational financial mechanisms for facing contingencies.\r\nIn a few weeks, the people of Venezuela will go to the\r\npolls to elect their new leaders. For 40 consecutive years,\r\nat each constitutionally determined interval, the transfer of\r\npower stipulated by the Constitution of the Republic has\r\nbeen carried out. In shifting circumstances, the institution\r\nof democracy has remained stable in an atmosphere of full\r\nand absolute freedom. A difficult economic situation and\r\nthe winds of change that are blowing throughout the world\r\nand are becoming stronger on the eve of a new millennium\r\nhave focused Venezuela’s political debate on the idea of\r\nchange. I am nevertheless convinced that, despite the\r\nchange Venezuela envisages, its people’s love for liberty\r\nand democracy as the best system of government and its\r\ncommitment to fight for peace and understanding among\r\nall nations will remain unaltered.\r\nMay I remind the Assembly that, although our fight\r\nfor political independence was perhaps the bloodiest of\r\nthe nineteenth century, we have not had a single violent\r\nconflict with any other country since the birth of our\r\nRepublic. In international forums, Venezuela has\r\ndistinguished itself by its constant support for universal\r\npeace and has always made its modest contribution to any\r\ninitiative in favour of justice and peace. That is why I can\r\nassure the Assembly that the next Government of\r\nVenezuela, whatever the electorate may decide, will\r\ncontinue to follow the same path within the United\r\nNations. The Organization can rely on Venezuela for\r\nanything relating to service to any and all human beings,\r\nor to friendship, cooperation and peace among nations,\r\nand anything required by the fight against crime, poverty,\r\ndrug-trafficking, terrorism, hatred, discrimination — all\r\nthe evils that have beset humanity. We trust that the\r\nUnited Nations will always stand against those evils as a\r\nshield against adversity and a beacon of hope.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Venezuela for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Rafael Caldera, President of the Republic of\r\nVenezuela, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister of Housing, Construction\r\nand Religious Affairs of the State of Israel\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister of Housing, Construction and Religious\r\nAffairs of the State of Israel.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister of Housing, Construction and Religious\r\nAffairs of the State of Israel, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister of Housing, Construction and Religious Affairs of\r\nthe State of Israel, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Netanyahu (Israel): As the Prime Minister of\r\nIsrael, I represent a State whose creation was envisioned,\r\nencouraged and advocated by the League of Nations 80\r\nyears ago and by the United Nations 50 years ago. That\r\nextraordinary recognition by the international community\r\nconfirmed what the Jewish people have known and felt for\r\ntwo millennia: the bond between the people of Israel and\r\nthe land of Israel is eternal, and the rebirth of the Jewish\r\nState in the land of Israel is a historic imperative.\r\nReligious and non-religious people alike have viewed\r\nthis rebirth as a modern miracle, the realization of the\r\nvision of the Hebrew prophets. Yet ever since that miracle\r\noccurred, we have all been hoping that it would be\r\naccompanied by the fulfilment of another biblical prophesy:\r\n“nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither\r\nshall they learn war any more.” (The Holy Bible,\r\nIsaiah 2:4)\r\nIt was in fact in that spirit that the founders of Israel\r\nstretched out the hand of peace to our neighbours in our\r\nDeclaration of Independence some 50 years ago. Now, half\r\na century later, as we view with pride our nation’s\r\nextraordinary accomplishments and achievements, we are\r\ndetermined to complete the circle of peace around us. No\r\npeople have suffered more from war and violence than the\r\nJewish people and no one wants peace more than we do. I\r\nknow that that is not a common perception of us. I,\r\npersonally, am often accused of not wanting peace. Nothing\r\ncould be further from the truth. I have been on the fields of\r\nbattle. I have seen my comrades fall. I have two small\r\nchildren at home. I want a future free of war — a future of\r\npeace, for them and for Palestinian children like them.\r\nWe want peace for us and for the Palestinian people,\r\nwhose prolonged suffering has been one of the cruel\r\nconsequences of the wars waged against us. We are willing\r\nto make painful compromises for peace. We hope that the\r\nPalestinians are ready to make those necessary\r\ncompromises as well. What is at stake is our life together\r\nin a very small land, and there is no reason that we should\r\nnot be able to live together. All of us are, after all, the sons\r\nand daughters of Abraham.\r\nAs we search for peace, we naturally encounter\r\ncrises and stalemates, frustrations and obstacles — that is\r\ninevitable in any negotiating process. But only\r\nnegotiations can solve our problems. An outcome which\r\nis not the result of negotiations is an invitation to\r\ncontinued conflict. Negotiations accompanied by violence\r\nand threats of violence are an invitation to failure. T h e\r\noption of violence must therefore be totally discarded and\r\npermanently disavowed.\r\nPeace will be achieved only by heeding the call\r\nmade by two great leaders, the late Egyptian President\r\nAnwar Sadat and Israel’s former Prime Minister\r\nMenachem Begin. Twenty-one years ago they declared in\r\nJerusalem, “No more war. No more bloodshed”.\r\nThe Treaty they hammered out at Camp David was\r\na historic turning point which changed the face of our\r\nregion. It has benefited both countries and brought hope\r\nto all of us, as has the peace with Jordan, which is a\r\nmodel peace for all our neighbours. King Hussein’s\r\ncontribution to this peace, his devotion to the\r\nadvancement of our relationship and his efforts to help\r\nthe peace process with the Palestinians have been\r\ninvaluable. In the name of the people of Israel and, I am\r\nsure, on behalf of all the peoples and Governments\r\nrepresented in the Assembly, I want to send King Hussein\r\nour most heartfelt wishes for a quick and complete\r\nrecovery.\r\nI believe we can achieve a successful peace\r\nagreement with the Palestinians as well. But for that\r\npeace to endure, it must be based on two principles. The\r\nfirst is security. A peace that cannot be defended will not\r\nlast. That is the central lesson of the twentieth century.\r\nNone of us can afford to forget this lesson, least of all the\r\nJewish people. As the Prime Minister of the one Jewish\r\nState, I must ensure Israel’s ability to defend itself,\r\nregardless of criticism and misunderstanding by those\r\nwho do not share this responsibility.\r\nThe second principle of a durable peace is\r\nreciprocity. Only agreements honoured by both sides can\r\nbe successful. The agreement between Israel and the\r\nPalestinians is at bottom based on a simple equation: the\r\nPalestinians receive jurisdiction in the territory in which\r\nthey live, and in return they prevent terrorist attacks\r\nagainst Israel from those territories. Israel has been\r\nfulfilling its part of this agreement: 100 per cent of the\r\nPalestinians in the Gaza district and 98 per cent of the\r\nPalestinians in Judean Samaria, known as the West Bank,\r\nare now living under Palestinian rule. They enjoy the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nattributes of self-government: they have their own flag,\r\ntheir own executive, legislative and judiciary bodies and\r\ntheir own police force.\r\nIt can no longer be claimed by anyone that Israel is\r\noccupying the Palestinians. We do not govern their lives.\r\nBut we cannot accept a situation in which they will threaten\r\nour lives, and that is of paramount concern to us as we\r\napproach further redeployment.\r\nThe territory we are negotiating about is virtually\r\nuninhabited by Palestinians — there are only a few\r\nthousand Bedouins there who roam about. Yet this land is\r\nthe canvas on which thousands of years of Jewish history\r\nhave been etched. And it has powerful implications for our\r\nsecurity. We should remember that at its widest point Israel\r\nis all of 50 miles wide, and should it cede all of the West\r\nBank, as some so cavalierly tell us to do, that distance\r\nwould be reduced to the distance between this building and\r\nLa Guardia airport. How many Governments and leaders\r\nwould put their nations at such risk? None. Yet we are\r\nprepared to undertake careful, controlled and calculated\r\nrisks for peace. Nevertheless, to part with one square inch\r\nof this land is agonizing for us, and for me personally.\r\nEvery stone and every hill and valley that I have walked —\r\nI know them intimately, as do my people — resonates with\r\nour forefathers’ footsteps, from the cradle of Jewish\r\ncivilization through the biblical kings and prophets and the\r\nsages, scholars and poets of Israel, down to our own time.\r\nYet in the spirit of compromise and reconciliation we\r\nhave agreed to transfer to Palestinian jurisdiction some of\r\nthis hallowed land, provided that the principles of security\r\nand reciprocity are kept. This means that Israel would retain\r\nthe ability to defend itself, and that the Palestinians would\r\nfulfil their commitments, first and foremost to shun\r\nviolence and fight terrorism.\r\nUnder the Oslo and Hebron agreements, which I\r\nsigned, the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat\r\nagreed to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure and arrest\r\nand prosecute terrorist operatives. They agreed to collect\r\nand dispose of illegal weapons, imprison and hand over\r\nwanted murderers and reduce the Palestinian police to the\r\nnumbers prescribed in the Oslo agreements. That has not\r\nbeen done to date. They also agreed to cease the vicious\r\ndaily propaganda on official Palestinian television; there are\r\nSesame Street programmes which exhort five-year olds to\r\nbecome suicide warriors. This, I am afraid, is education for\r\nwar, not for peace. And they agreed that they must\r\ncomplete the annulment of the Palestinian Charter, which\r\ncan only be done by the Palestinian National Council. That\r\nCharter is still on the books and still on the Internet — if\r\nrepresentatives turn it on they can find it. It still calls for\r\nIsrael’s destruction thorough armed struggle, which is a\r\neuphemism for terrorism. So I say today to our\r\nPalestinian partners “Choose peace. Fight for peace. You\r\ncannot talk peace and tolerate terrorism”.\r\nOf course, terrorism endangers our peace, but it is\r\nalso a global cancer. Many leaders today understand this,\r\nas President Clinton made abundantly clear from this very\r\npodium a few days ago. But what makes the terrorism\r\nrooted in the Middle East so pernicious and so dangerous\r\nis that the terrorists invoke a distorted, twisted and fanatic\r\ninterpretation of Islam, which is very distant from\r\nenlightened Islam. We have no quarrel with Islam. It is\r\none of the world’s great religions, and we have\r\nadmiration and respect for its institutions and its\r\nteachings. But fanatic Islamist terrorism is religion\r\nbetrayed, and it not only threatens us but undermines\r\nArab Governments and societies. It endangers the peace\r\nof the world.\r\nFor terrorism to be defeated, terrorists must be\r\npunished and deterred, and the climate of support they\r\nenjoy in various lands must disappear. That is the only\r\nway that terrorism will decline and its growth be arrested\r\nand that it will ultimately be rooted out from our lives.\r\nThe elimination of terrorism will undoubtedly lead\r\nto prosperity in our region. We envision a market-based\r\nregional economy between Israel, Jordan and the\r\nPalestinian Authority. As I speak we are lifting the\r\nbarriers to trade, eliminating red tape and promoting joint\r\nbusiness ventures between the parties. Trade between\r\nIsrael and the Palestinians has shot up enormously in the\r\nlast two years because our policy is a liberal policy. If\r\nthings are better for them economically, things are better\r\nfor us. I should like to give an example relating to the\r\ntransfer of value added tax (VAT) from Palestinian\r\nworkers working in Israel, whose numbers have grown\r\nenormously in the last two years. Three years ago we\r\ntransferred about 700 million shekels to the Palestinian\r\nAuthority from the work of Palestinian workers in Israel.\r\nThis year that figure will reach 2 billion shekels. That is\r\nalmost a threefold increase in three years. Representatives\r\ndo not know that; none of them knows that we have\r\ndramatically improved the Palestinian economy because\r\nwe believe that life better for them is life better for us.\r\nThe absence of violence will enable all of us,\r\nPalestinians, Jordanians, Egyptians and Israelis, and, I\r\nmay add, Syrians and Lebanese — this is not a far-\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nfetched dream; it is certainly one that I have — to reach a\r\nstandard of living and quality of life now considered\r\nunimaginable. Once we complete the current talks we will\r\nbegin negotiations for the final settlement — a final\r\nsettlement of peace with the Palestinian Authority.\r\nI urged starting these negotiations a year ago, but I\r\nregret to say that my offer was turned down. This phase is\r\nlong overdue. But as the late Yitzhak Rabin noted, no dates\r\nin the Oslo accords are sacrosanct. No target date in them\r\nwas met on schedule. This failure to meet deadlines did not\r\nput an end to the agreement. The Oslo accords are not\r\nabout meeting deadlines. Their essential purpose is to reach\r\na peace agreement through negotiations.\r\nAn arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian\r\nState, in disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo, would\r\nconstitute a fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It\r\nwould cause the complete collapse of the process. I strongly\r\nurge the Palestinian Authority not to take this course. Such\r\nactions will inevitably prompt unilateral responses on our\r\npart, and that development would not be good for the\r\nPalestinians, not good for Israel, and not good for peace.\r\nWe must continue to negotiate, earnestly, continuously\r\nand tirelessly until a final peace agreement is reached. No\r\nother way will do.\r\nWhat would such a peace look like? I envision its\r\nsuccess would lie in ensuring the following balance: the\r\nPalestinians should have all the powers to govern their lives\r\nand none of the powers to threaten our lives. They will\r\nhave control of all aspects of their society, such as law,\r\nreligion and education; industry, commerce and agriculture;\r\ntourism, health and welfare. They can prosper and flourish.\r\nWhat they cannot do is endanger our existence. We have a\r\nright to ensure that the Palestinian entity does not become\r\nthe base for hostile forces, including foreign forces. We\r\nhave a right to ensure that it does not become a base and\r\nhaven for terrorists. In some cases we are talking about a\r\nbase — in New York city terms — five blocks away, and\r\nwithout the East River. We are talking about something that\r\nis not hypothetical.\r\nAs I prepared this speech, I was informed of a\r\nterrorist attack — another one — in Jerusalem, in a bus\r\nstation. Happily, no one was killed today. But can we be\r\nsure? We are seeking a peace that is peaceful, that is not\r\nviolent — a peace without terror, which is the only peace\r\nthat means anything.\r\nNor can we accept the mortal threat of weapons such\r\nas anti-aircraft missiles on the hills above our cities and\r\nairfields. If any representatives were to land at Tel Aviv\r\nairport — as many have in the past — their planes could\r\nbe endangered by the inability of Israel, in a permanent\r\npeace settlement, to control the importation of these lethal\r\nweapons. This is the great challenge of the permanent\r\nstatus negotiations: to achieve a durable peace that will\r\nstrike a balance between Palestinian self-rule and Israeli\r\nsecurity. This peace can be achieved by negotiation, and\r\nnegotiation alone. There is no other way.\r\nNegotiation for peace is what we want with Lebanon\r\nand Syria as well. As representatives know, over six\r\nmonths ago our Government announced an initiative to\r\nimplement Security Council resolution 425 (1978). In our\r\ndecision, we said that Israel was prepared to withdraw\r\nfrom south Lebanon provided that one condition was met:\r\nthat there would be security arrangements to ensure the\r\nsafety of the civilian population on both sides of the\r\nLebanese-Israeli border.\r\nI can report that I find myself now in the bizarre\r\nposition of offering to withdraw from an Arab country\r\nand meeting with Arab refusal to negotiate such a\r\nwithdrawal. But I can also report that we remain hopeful.\r\nWe have not abandoned this initiative.\r\nPeace with Syria and Lebanon will complete the\r\ncircle of peace with our immediate neighbours. But the\r\nachievement of a lasting peace in our region requires\r\naddressing the ominous existential dangers which still\r\nthreaten Israel beyond the immediate horizon. Both Iran\r\nand Iraq continue their efforts to acquire non-conventional\r\nweapons and ballistic missiles with strategic reach. Iran\r\nhas just successfully tested an intermediate-range missile.\r\nIraq has declared that it will no longer accept\r\ninternational inspections of its non-conventional\r\nprogrammes, inspections mandated by Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nThese developments threaten not only Israel, but all\r\nthe nations represented in this Hall. In the hands of the\r\nrogue regimes of the Middle East, weapons of mass\r\ndestruction may pose a greater threat to the world, and to\r\nworld peace, than anything we have known in the past. I\r\nwant to caution members about something else: to let\r\nsweet talk by leaders of these regimes lull us into inaction\r\nis to repeat the worst mistakes of this century. What is\r\nrequired instead is concerted international action to\r\nprevent disaster.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nThat, after all, is what this body was established to do.\r\nAnd if it is to live up to its founders’ expectations, it will\r\nhave to be far more adept at distinguishing between\r\nfanatical aggressors and their intended victims. I believe\r\nthat the United Nations can help foster a climate of peace\r\nand stability in our region by encouraging the reactivation\r\nof the multilateral committees conceived at the Madrid\r\nConference. By addressing such issues as regional\r\neconomic development, arms control, the resolution of\r\nrefugee problems, water and the environment, these\r\ncommittees can produce the important building blocks of\r\npeace.\r\nBut ultimately, as in every conflict, the crucial\r\ndecisions must be made by the peoples of the Middle East\r\nthemselves. They must decide whether the region will\r\ncontinue to be an arena for terrorism and war or become a\r\nfull participant in a peaceful, prosperous global economy.\r\nCooperation and peace can give the Middle East a leading\r\nposition in the world of the next millennium. Violence,\r\nterrorism and war will assure stagnation and misery.\r\nDeep in our hearts, we know which choice we want\r\nfor our children. My wife and I hope that when our two\r\nlittle boys grow up, the only competition they will engage\r\nin with Palestinian boys, and Egyptian boys, and Jordanian\r\nand Syrian and Lebanese boys, will be on football fields\r\nand in debating societies.\r\nIt is characteristic of the Jewish people to live in hope.\r\nIt is the name of our national anthem. It is what has made\r\nit possible for us, despite unparalleled persecution, despite\r\nthe most horrific calamities to befall any people or any\r\nnation, clinging to hope, to contribute as much as we have\r\nto human progress in the past 4,000 years. And this hope is\r\nreflected in the prayer we utter this week as we celebrate\r\nthe Jewish new year. It is a wish we extend from our\r\neternal capital Jerusalem, the city of peace, to all our\r\nneighbours and to all present here today: “May the year and\r\nits maledictions end, and a new year and its blessings\r\nbegin”. Shana tova — may you have a good year.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I thank the Prime Minister,\r\nand Minister of Housing and Construction and Religious\r\nAffairs of the State of Israel for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nof Housing, Construction and Religious Affairs of the\r\nState of Israel, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nIndia\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of India.\r\nMr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of India,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): It is\r\nmy pleasure to welcome His Excellency Mr. Atal Behari\r\nVajpayee, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of India, and to invite him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Vajpayee (India) (spoke in Hindi; interpretation\r\nfurnished by the delegation): I congratulate you, Sir, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-third session. We wish you well in our shared\r\nendeavours in the United Nations and offer you our full\r\ncooperation. We would like to thank your predecessor for\r\nhis commitment and contribution, and to commend him\r\nfor his work throughout the last year.\r\nI first addressed the Assembly as Foreign Minister\r\nin 1977. Since then I have for many years had the\r\nprivilege to attend General Assembly sessions, but\r\nwithout ministerial responsibility. I acknowledge with\r\ngratitude the confidence of successive Prime Ministers.\r\nTo me, this also signifies the consensus on the national\r\ninterests and the foreign policy of India. When I\r\naddressed the General Assembly in 1977, it was in many\r\nways a turning point in the history of India. The Janata\r\nGovernment was a coalition of many factions, which\r\nunited in the restoration of our people’s faith in\r\ndemocracy. Since then we have had many changes of\r\nGovernment, but the people’s political awareness and\r\ntheir faith in the institutions which uphold our\r\nconstitutional system has been unwavering. Today, when\r\nI come to this rostrum as Prime Minister, I come on\r\nbehalf of another coalition. India has demonstrated that\r\ndemocracy can take root in a developing country. I am\r\nconfident that the Indian experience will prove that\r\ndemocracy can also provide the basis for stable, long-term\r\neconomic growth in developing societies. That is the path\r\nthat the people of India have chosen, and I stand before\r\nthe Assembly today as the symbol of this new resurgent\r\nIndia.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nMr. Chkheidze (Georgia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe world of the 1970s has receded into history. The\r\nshackling constraints of the cold war are gone. The\r\ndistinguishing feature of the last two decades has been the\r\nspread of democracy worldwide. By force of example, we\r\nhave been one of the authors of the triumph of democracy.\r\nFrom this flows our desire to see the democratization of the\r\nUnited Nations itself. An international body that does not\r\nreflect, and change with, changing international realities\r\nwill inevitably face a credibility deficit. We therefore\r\nsupport a revitalized and more effective United Nations,\r\none that is more responsive to the concerns of the vast\r\nmajority of its Member States and is better equipped to\r\nmeet the challenges that are ahead of us in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe Security Council does not represent contemporary\r\nreality; it does not represent democracy in international\r\nrelations. Following the end of the cold war, it acquired the\r\nfreedom to act, but experience shows that the Council has\r\nacted only when it was convenient for its permanent\r\nmembers. The experience of Somalia does not do credit to\r\nthe Security Council — and there are other examples too.\r\nPeacekeeping operations cannot be a reflection of ulterior\r\npolitical priorities and perceptions.\r\nThere is only one cure: to bring in new blood. The\r\nSecurity Council must be made representative of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations. Developing countries\r\nmust be made permanent members. This is a right to which\r\nthe developing world is entitled. The presence of some\r\ndeveloping countries as permanent members is inescapable\r\nif the responsibilities of the Security Council are to be\r\neffectively discharged, particularly when we see that the\r\nCouncil acts almost exclusively in the developing world. It\r\nis only natural that on decisions affecting the developing\r\nworld, these countries should have a say, on equal terms.\r\nAlong with other measures, the Security Council too must\r\nbe reformed, expanding its non-permanent membership so\r\nthat more developing countries can serve on it. But that\r\nalone is not enough, because as long as effective power in\r\nthe Council rests with the permanent membership, the\r\ninterests of the developing world will not be promoted or\r\nprotected unless developing countries are made permanent\r\nmembers on a par with the present permanent members.\r\nOnly this will make the Council an effective instrument for\r\nthe international community in dealing with current and\r\nfuture challenges.\r\nThe new permanent members must of course have\r\nthe ability to discharge the responsibilities that come with\r\npermanent membership. India believes it has that ability,\r\nand, as we have said before from this rostrum, we are\r\nprepared to accept the responsibilities of permanent\r\nmembership, and believe we are qualified for it.\r\nIt will be a great day when democracy becomes the\r\nuniversal norm, and when the United Nations reflects that\r\ndemocracy in its institutions and functioning. However,\r\nopen democratic societies have one scourge to contend\r\nwith: terrorism. The challenge before countries like mine\r\nand other democracies is to maintain our openness,\r\nsafeguard individual rights, and at the same time give no\r\nquarter to terrorists. Several speakers before me have\r\nrecounted the terrible toll that terrorists have exacted\r\nworldwide, taking advantage of the trust that characterizes\r\nopen societies. I recall that the Group of Seven summit\r\nalmost two decades back identified terrorism as one of the\r\nmost serious threats to civilized societies. Events since\r\nthen, including the blowing up of the Air India Kanishka\r\naircraft and the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, and the\r\nrecent bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, have only\r\nestablished the correctness of that judgement.\r\nTerrorism is one threat that affects us all equally.\r\nTerrorism takes a daily toll around the world. It is the\r\nmost vicious among international crimes, and the most\r\npervasive, pernicious and ruthless threat to the lives of\r\nmen and women in open societies, and to international\r\npeace and security. In India, we have had to cope with\r\nterrorism aided and abetted by a neighbouring country for\r\nnearly two decades. We have borne this with patience, but\r\nnone should doubt the strength of our resolve to crush\r\nthis challenge. Its tentacles have spread around the world.\r\nToday, it has links with illicit trade in drugs and arms and\r\nwith money-laundering. In short, terrorism has gone\r\nglobal and it can only be defeated by organized\r\ninternational action.\r\nLet us make up our minds once and for all: terrorism\r\nis a crime against humanity. Unilateral steps can hardly\r\nstand scrutiny in an open society, let alone in the eyes of\r\nthe international community. It should be the primary task\r\nof all open and pluralist societies to develop collective\r\nmeans for tackling this menace. At its summit meeting in\r\nDurban, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries called\r\nfor an international conference in 1999 to develop such a\r\ncollective response. We earnestly recommend that the\r\n1999 conference launch the process of negotiations on an\r\ninternational convention to provide for collective action\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nagainst States and organizations which initiate or aid and\r\nabet terrorism.\r\nNow, at the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, there is a growing realization\r\nthat economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights\r\nform a seamless web. Analyses carried out in recent years\r\nby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees amply reflect the vicious cycle of how violations\r\nof economic, social and cultural rights inevitably lead to\r\nviolations of civil and political rights. In defining its index,\r\nthe Human Development Report gives a higher weighting\r\nto economic criteria for developing countries; this weighting\r\nis reduced for developed countries, highlighting the\r\nimportance of the right to development for developing\r\nsocieties. It is therefore a matter of concern that the\r\nabsolutism that some are seeking to advocate in the\r\npromotion of human rights is often at the cost of the right\r\nto development.\r\nIndia has ratified both the International Covenant on\r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International\r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. Other institutions in\r\nour country — the National Human Rights Commission, a\r\nfree media and an independent judiciary — all serve to\r\nensure that the rights set out in international human rights\r\nstatutes are enjoyed by all citizens. We also remain\r\nconvinced that unless progress is made on economic, social\r\nand cultural rights, including the right to development, the\r\nworld will continue to witness international conflict leading\r\nto migrations, displacement of people and human rights\r\nabuses.\r\nIn the closing years of the twentieth century, the\r\nchallenge of nuclear disarmament is another of the priorities\r\nfacing the international community. We have successfully\r\nprohibited chemical and biological weapons in recent\r\ndecades. The present century has witnessed the\r\ndevelopment and the tragic use of nuclear weapons. We\r\nmust ensure that the legacy of this weapon of mass\r\ndestruction is not carried into the next century.\r\nFor the last half-century, India has consistently\r\npursued the objectives of international peace, along with\r\nequal and legitimate security for all through global\r\ndisarmament. These concepts are among the basic tenets of\r\nour national security. India has, over the years, sought to\r\nenhance its national security by promoting global nuclear\r\ndisarmament, convinced that a world free of nuclear\r\nweapons would enhance both global security and India’s\r\nnational security.\r\nThe negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) began in 1993 with a mandate that\r\nsuch a treaty would contribute effectively to the non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons in all aspects, to the\r\nprocess of nuclear disarmament and, therefore, to the\r\nenhancement of international peace and security. India\r\nparticipated actively and constructively in the\r\nnegotiations, and sought to place the Treaty in a\r\ndisarmament framework by proposing its linkage with a\r\ntime-bound programme for the universal elimination of all\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nIt is a matter of history that India’s proposals were\r\nnot accepted. The Treaty, as it emerged, was not accepted\r\nby India on grounds of national security. We made\r\nexplicit our objection that, despite our stand having been\r\nmade clear, the Treaty text made India’s signature and\r\nratification a precondition for its entry into force. Mindful\r\nof its deteriorating security environment, which obliged us\r\nto stand apart from the CTBT in 1996, India undertook a\r\nlimited series of five underground tests, conducted on 11\r\nand 13 May 1998. These tests were essential for ensuring\r\na credible nuclear deterrent for India’s national security in\r\nthe foreseeable future.\r\nThese tests do not signal a dilution of India’s\r\ncommitment to the pursuit of global nuclear disarmament.\r\nAccordingly, after concluding this limited testing\r\nprogramme, India announced a voluntary moratorium on\r\nfurther underground nuclear test explosions. We conveyed\r\nour willingness to move towards a de jure formalization\r\nof that obligation. In announcing a moratorium, India has\r\nalready accepted the basic obligation of the CTBT. In\r\n1996, India could not have accepted the obligation, as\r\nsuch a restraint would have eroded our capability and\r\ncompromised our national security.\r\nIndia, having harmonized its national imperatives\r\nand security obligations and desirous of continuing to\r\ncooperate with the international community, is now\r\nengaged in discussions with key interlocutors on a range\r\nof issues, including the CTBT. We are prepared to bring\r\nthese discussions to a successful conclusion, so that the\r\nentry into force of the CTBT is not delayed beyond\r\nSeptember 1999. We expect that other countries, as\r\nindicated in article XIV of the Treaty, will adhere to it\r\nwithout conditions.\r\nAfter protracted discussions, the Conference on\r\nDisarmament in Geneva is now in a position to begin\r\nnegotiations on a treaty that will prohibit the production\r\nof fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nexplosive devices. Once again, we are conscious that this is\r\na partial step. Such a treaty, as and when it is concluded\r\nand enters into force, will not eliminate existing nuclear\r\narsenals. Yet we will participate in these negotiations in\r\ngood faith in order to ensure a treaty that is non-\r\ndiscriminatory and meets India’s security imperatives. India\r\nwill pay serious attention to any other multilateralinitiatives\r\nin this area during the course of the negotiations in the\r\nConference on Disarmament.\r\nAs a responsible State committed to non-proliferation,\r\nIndia has undertaken that it shall not transfer these weapons\r\nor related know-how to other countries. We have an\r\neffective system of export controls and shall make it more\r\nstringent where necessary, including by expanding control\r\nlists of equipment and technology to make them more\r\ncontemporary and effective in the context of a nuclear\r\nIndia. At the same time, as a developing country, we are\r\nconscious that nuclear technology has a number of peaceful\r\napplications, and we shall continue to cooperate actively\r\nwith other countries in this regard, in keeping with our\r\ninternational responsibilities.\r\nA few weeks ago, at the Non-Aligned Summit in\r\nDurban, India proposed, and the Movement agreed, that an\r\ninternational conference be held, preferably in 1999, with\r\nthe objective of arriving at an agreement before the end of\r\nthis millennium on a phased programme for the complete\r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. I call upon all members\r\nof the international community, and particularly the other\r\nnuclear-weapon States, to join in this endeavour. Let us\r\npledge that when we assemble here in the new millennium\r\nit will be to welcome the commitment that mankind shall\r\nnever again be subjected to the use or threat of use of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nThe decade of the 1990s has fallen far short of\r\nexpectations. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the\r\nglobal economic scene. The sense of triumphalism that\r\nheralded the wave of global capitalism is now giving way\r\nto caution and realism. What was initially seen as an Asian\r\nflu is now spreading to other continents.\r\nThe hypothesis that unfettered capital flows would\r\nfoster economic development, with the global financial\r\nmarkets adjusting the exchange rates, stands falsified. What\r\nwe have seen is the growth of a large volume of “virtual\r\nmoney” that has not been generated by productive\r\neconomic activity. But the power of the “virtual money” is\r\nreal, evident in the fact that national regulatory mechanisms\r\nare unable to cope with the impact of its rapid movement\r\nin and out of currencies. Its volatility in the short run\r\nfollows not economic logic but rumour and sentiment,\r\nwith results that are self-reinforcing. In developing\r\ncountries and in western financial capitals, there is now\r\na growing acceptance that premature liberalization of\r\ncapital markets has been a primary cause of the current\r\ncrisis.\r\nDoes it mean that the world should turn back from\r\nglobalization? Our answer is an emphatic “No”. Rising\r\neconomic interdependence is a phenomenon driven by the\r\ntechnological imperative, but we must learn how to\r\nmanage the change. India has not been affected as\r\nseverely as some other countries, largely because we\r\nadopted policies that were more prudent. But a drop in\r\ncommodity prices by 30 per cent in a year and a\r\nreduction in net capital flows to the emerging markets by\r\n50 per cent will have a negative impact on growth\r\neverywhere, including in the developed world.\r\nI must emphasize that democratically elected\r\nleadership in an open developing society such as India\r\nalso faces another challenge. We cannot let an unbridled\r\nfree market system aggravate existing economic and\r\nsocial disparities. In fact, we need policy instruments to\r\nreduce disparities, thus creating a more stable\r\nenvironment in the long term. Such policies are necessary\r\nin accountable democracies and are in no way\r\ninconsistent with managed liberalization.\r\nIt is high time that we begin a new international\r\ndialogue on the future of a global and interdependent\r\neconomy. This is a task for the sovereign States\r\nrepresented here and cannot be left solely to the dynamics\r\nof an unregulated market place.\r\nI think I speak for all of us when I say that we are\r\non the threshold of a new age. This is an overused phrase,\r\nbut we are all aware that an exciting new universe is\r\nwithin our reach. Several centuries ago, Isaac Newton\r\ndescribed his scientific discoveries as pebbles on the\r\nbeach, while the ocean of truth lay undiscovered. It was\r\nmodest of that great scientist to so describe his work, but\r\nI believe that we are now actually sailing\r\nin the ocean of truth. We have made exciting discoveries\r\nand will make many more which will move humankind\r\nforward.\r\nAnd yet there is also an uneasy feeling that all is not\r\nwell. The world is not at ease with itself. In almost all\r\nparts of the world forces are bubbling under the surface\r\ntranquillity that threaten the gains of the last century and\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nseek to lead the world towards bigotry, violence and\r\nunhealthy exclusivism.\r\nIndia has a message — not a new one, for almost all\r\nreligions have expressed the thought before. But we have\r\npreserved the tenets of freedom, equality and tolerance in\r\nour daily lives. If the world of the twenty-first century is to\r\nbe a better place than the world we have seen so far, these\r\nvalues must prevail. History also shows that these are easier\r\nto prescribe than to observe. And yet, as we move towards\r\never closer interdependence, there is no alternative. The\r\nworld and its leaders must summon the will to rise to the\r\noccasion and enter the new age with a new outlook. This is\r\nthe task before us, and I declare India’s readiness to make\r\nits full contribution in the testing times ahead.\r\nI close with an ancient “sloka” from the Rig Ved as\r\ncomposed thousands of years ago in Sanskrit, the oldest\r\nlanguage in the world:\r\n“Svastir manushebhyaha\r\nOordhvam Jugatu beshajam\r\nSam no astu dvipathe\r\nSam Chathusthpate\r\nOm Shanti, Shanti, Shanti”\r\nThis means: Let all human beings be blessed with\r\nprosperity. Let all flora and fauna which are life line of all\r\ncreatures grow abundantly. Let there be harmony with all\r\ntwo-legged creations. Let there be harmony with all four-\r\nlegged creations. Let there be peace, peace, peace.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of India for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of India,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Bronislaw Geremek, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nPoland.\r\nMr. Geremek (Poland): Allow me first to congratulate\r\nthe President and wish him every success in carrying out\r\nhis responsible task. The delegation of Poland will do its\r\nbest to assist him in his important functions.\r\nI also pay tribute to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, an eminent statesman from\r\nUkraine, a country with which we have developed good-\r\nneighbourly ties of friendship and cooperation, for his\r\nexcellent guidance of the work of the Assembly during its\r\nfifty-second session.\r\nI would also like to assure the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, not only of our respect and admiration,\r\nbut also of our continued support for his tireless efforts to\r\nmake the United Nations live up to the expectations of\r\nthe twenty-first century and to the ideals set out in the\r\nCharter.\r\nWe have a saying in Poland that is variously\r\nattributed to the Chinese or to the Jews — two nations\r\nwell steeped in suffering and in wisdom:\r\n“Unfortunate one, you shall live to see your dreams\r\nsatisfied.”\r\nAnd I, indeed, have come to experience the full measure\r\nof that truth. Ten years ago a dissident, I could barely\r\neven dream that I would be at the helm of my free\r\nnation’s foreign affairs, and in that role preside over the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), an organization which spans three continents in\r\nits attempt to promote security and cooperation in a\r\nconflict-torn world.\r\nAnd yet those 10 years ago, had I imagined that\r\nsuch a future were possible I would probably have\r\nbelieved that a man in my position could indeed help\r\nchange the world, make it a better, safer place. Like so\r\nmany of us present here in this Hall, I had to learn the\r\nbitter lessons of the limitations of power. These lessons\r\nshould indeed teach us humility, but not serve as an alibi\r\nfor not assuming our obligations.\r\nThe world today is a better and safer place than it\r\nwas 10 years ago, before the fall of the Berlin Wall. For\r\nall the needless suffering, the agony of hunger, the\r\nscourge of ethnic hatred and war, the shame of\r\nunderdevelopment, the evil of oppression that human\r\nbeings had to endure in so many places on the face of the\r\nplanet — these are less than a decade ago. And even now\r\nthe perpetrators attempt to conceal their doings, to show\r\nit is not so, and more, that suffering is contentment, war\r\nis peace, and oppression is liberty. Hypocrisy, as we all\r\nknow, is a compliment sin pays to virtue.\r\nThe world is a better place because time and time\r\nagain evil has been avoided, circumscribed or reduced\r\nthanks to preventive action taken by concerned States.\r\nThis action could be something as simple as sending food\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nwhere there is none, or as complicated as over a dozen\r\nnations pooling their military resources to prevent a new\r\noutbreak of ethnic hatred in Bosnia, and helping to rebuild\r\nthat devastated nation.\r\nThe world will never be the same. The world economy\r\nis currently confronted with the biggest financial challenge\r\nin a half century. We note the increasing interest on the\r\npart of politicians as well as economists in market\r\nintervention and capital controls. Obviously, a serious\r\nsituation may indeed call for desperate remedies, but the\r\nreally serious risk to the world economy seems to lie in a\r\nretreat from free market ideals and principles.\r\nActions to limit the spread of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction are an evident reflection of efforts made to\r\nconsolidate peace and international security. Systematic\r\nprogress in the field of nuclear disarmament, apart from\r\nimportant American-Russian and American-Chinese\r\nagreements, could become even more notable if the\r\nParliament of the Russian Federation, heeding the appeals\r\nby the international community, ratified the START II\r\nagreements. We expect and hope that the indispensable\r\ndecision will be taken in Moscow with no further delay.\r\nWe welcome the decision of the Geneva Conference\r\non Disarmament to enter negotiations on a treaty banning\r\nthe production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and\r\nother nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices.\r\nThis is a significant and indispensable step for the further\r\nconsolidation of the global regime of non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nAt the same time, we witness with concern and regret\r\nthe developments in South Asia that are so dangerous to\r\npeace and international security. Although we do not\r\nquestion the right of any nation to sovereign decisions on\r\nissues concerning its national security interests, nothing, in\r\nour opinion, justifies acceptance of the nuclear option. The\r\nchoice of the road of nuclear armaments by India and\r\nPakistan comes as a blow to the ideals personified by\r\nMahatma Gandhi.\r\nTogether with the entire international community, we\r\naddress to the leaders of India and Pakistan an appeal to\r\nrefrain from any actions that could make the situation\r\nworse in the Indian subcontinent and to join, immediately\r\nand unconditionally, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT).\r\nThe sixteenth-century Polish humanist Jakub Przyluski\r\nwrote:\r\n“Since man is ... more inclined to live in society\r\nthan bees, ants or cranes, an isolated life is a thing\r\nmost contrary to human nature. Man could then\r\nneither suffice to himself, nor come to the rescue of\r\nothers... And since nature has established some kind\r\nof affinity between us, and the same definition\r\nencompasses all humankind, we are to consider it\r\nvile if man threatens man.”\r\nWe, indeed, consider it vile if man threatens man.\r\nBut it is in our nature, or at least in our better nature, to\r\ncome to the rescue of others, the more so if by making\r\nothers more secure, our own security is enhanced.\r\nFurthermore, neighbours usually know best the nature of\r\nthe problems affecting the neighbourhood; they are\r\ntherefore best placed to try to resolve them. That is why\r\nthe concept of collective security is becoming so\r\nincreasingly important and popular. But we must all learn\r\nthis if this Organization is to successfully negotiate the\r\ntransition into the twenty-first century. The United\r\nNations has grown beyond the hopes and expectations —\r\nindeed, beyond control.\r\nMany of its specialized agencies accomplish their\r\nimportant jobs quietly and efficiently. We have perfect\r\nrelations with many of them, especially with the United\r\nNations Development Programme office in Warsaw.\r\nThe Secretary-General is to be praised for his efforts\r\nto make the United Nations a better example of how the\r\nworld’s institutions could function, rather than a cartoon\r\nof the way they actually do. But he can do this only with\r\nour support. Also, we can no longer delay the reform of\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly. I am sure\r\nall of us look towards these changes with some dread,\r\nbecause knowing how wrong things could have turned\r\nout, we cannot believe that they have been going right\r\nuntil now. The United Nations is ripe for change.\r\nOne of the most pressing issues on the United\r\nNations reform agenda is the financial crisis. It is true this\r\ncrisis is due in great part to the mismanagement of\r\nresources and, at times, excessive spending. But at least\r\nas much can be attributed to the deficit brought about by\r\nsome Members’ refusal to pay their dues on time. True,\r\nit is in large part because that pressure that a favourable\r\nclimate for change emerged within the institution itself.\r\nIt has become a truism to say that peacekeeping is\r\nineffective when there is no peace to keep, and that\r\npeacemaking is impossible if there is no will to sustain\r\nthe unavoidable costs. But this does not mean that\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\npeacekeeping is ineffective. A wide spectrum of examples,\r\nfrom Cyprus to Moldova, shows that the contrary is true.\r\nBut even in a successful peacekeeping operation we run the\r\nrisk that we will not only keep the peace but also preserve\r\nthe hatreds, envies and jealousies which were the root\r\ncauses of the conflict in the first place. In this sense, each\r\npeacekeeping operation must also be one of peacemaking.\r\nArmed conflicts between States are giving way to\r\ninternal conflicts, as in Rwanda and in the former\r\nYugoslavia. Consequently, the United Nations peacekeeping\r\nforces are being faced, in many cases, with the dilemma of\r\nhaving to depart from the principle of non-interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of the State that is being torn apart by\r\na civil war. We remain convinced that when a direct threat\r\nis posed to peace and security, the United Nations must be\r\nproperly equipped to discharge its role and should not\r\nremain indifferent and ignore human suffering.\r\nPoland is proud of its continuous participation in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts, following our old\r\ntradition of struggle “for freedom, ours and yours”. We are\r\ncurrently providing the largest contingent of troops involved\r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are\r\nconvinced that the Organization should not allow the\r\nhighest price to be paid in terms of the lives of women and\r\nmen serving in the field under the United Nations banner.\r\nThe security of people in United Nations peacekeeping and\r\nhumanitarian operations must be ensured.\r\nMy country finds itself at the centre of European\r\ntransformation. Our aspirations to join European and trans-\r\nAtlantic political and military structures are in the process\r\nof being satisfied, fulfilling the dreams of a nation long\r\nsubject to the cataclysms of European history. But far from\r\nturning our back on our neighbours who as yet remain\r\noutside these structures, we indeed wish to intensify our\r\ncooperation with them. We believe this would be conducive\r\nto a better climate on the continent, and in the best interests\r\nof both our neighbours and our allies.\r\nThis is especially true of our cooperation with other\r\nCentral European nations. Poland, solidly anchored in\r\ncollective security and regional cooperation structures, can\r\ndevelop in peace and security and substantially contribute\r\nto the development of others. If there ever was a win-win\r\nscenario, this is it.\r\nIt would be arrogant and unhelpful if we believed we\r\ncould give lessons to others. But we do believe deeply that\r\nour experience of the last decade shows that nations can\r\nmove away from authoritarianism, through negotiations —\r\nwhat we called round-table negotiations — to then\r\nsuccessfully build a democratic system based on the rule\r\nof law, individual freedoms, freedom of economic\r\nenterprise and political democracy. To those, near or far,\r\nwho proclaim that theirs will be a different course, based\r\non the presumed specificity of their culture, history,\r\ncustoms and circumstance, we say, “Please reconsider. Do\r\nnot waste the creative energy of your nations in futile\r\nexperiments and grotesque performances.” This will not\r\nwork. And time is a resource none can afford to waste.\r\nBut at the same time, to those who would say,\r\n“Follow us, for history has proved that we are right”, —\r\nwe would like to say that even among friends we can\r\ndiffer. We do not believe too much in the efficacy of\r\npunishment and sanction. Rather, we expect that nations\r\nneed to develop apace. We can but help them on their\r\nway.\r\nThis is best seen in the functioning of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), which my country has the honour of chairing\r\nthis year. It would be hard to imagine a collection of\r\nnations more geographically, historically, economically,\r\nculturally and politically diverse. Assuming the\r\nchairmanship of this organization for 1998, we have faced\r\nimportant questions and challenges. Can the organization\r\nthat is the heritage of the past successfully cope with the\r\nchallenges of the future? Is it needed during a period of\r\nboth globalization and regionalization, a period of multi-\r\npolarity, when we are striving for the universalization of\r\nthe Earth’s civilization? Will it be able to prevent\r\nconflicts and regulate inter-State relations?\r\nThe Polish chairmanship started at the moment of\r\nsignificant changes in the so-called European security\r\nenvironment: when the Atlantic Alliance decided on its\r\nenlargement; when a conflict erupted in Kosovo,\r\nthreatening South-Eastern Europe with destabilization;\r\nwhen the countries of Central Asia, born from the\r\nterritory of the former Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics, signalled their more intensive interest in\r\njoining the current of values that are the foundation of the\r\nOSCE; and when signs of another crisis appeared in\r\nRussia. There arose the question of how to include OSCE\r\nactivity in United Nations efforts for peace and security.\r\nWe have found constructive and positive answers to\r\nmany of those questions. The organization of an all-\r\ninclusive membership of the States of the region, from\r\nVancouver to Vladivostok, turned out to be necessary to\r\nrespond to threats left by the cold war. Two priorities\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\ncame to the fore: to prevent conflicts by reaching the roots\r\nat their early stage of appearance and to strengthen human\r\nrights and democracy, which the OSCE calls the “human\r\ndimension”. We have also taken up the ambitious challenge\r\nof preparing a European security charter, which would help\r\nto facilitate the functioning of cooperation in security within\r\nthe OSCE, and would make it possible for all States,\r\nregardless of their membership in alliances or other\r\ngroupings, to participate in the common effort of building\r\na safe, democratic and united Europe.\r\nWe want the OSCE community to have neither centre\r\nnor peripheries, neither more equal nor less equal. In many\r\ncases, as in the conflicts in Kosovo or Tajikistan, the lesson\r\nwas bitter. One of the conclusions is that in the\r\ncontemporary world, no organization can act alone. The\r\nconsolidation of standards of civilizational cooperation\r\nwithin the OSCE must be coherent with the activity of\r\nother organizations, in this case the United Nations, the\r\nEuropean Union, the North Atlantic Alliance, the Council\r\nof Europe and subregional organizations such as the\r\nCouncil of the Baltic States.\r\nWe need this solidarity. There I wish to comment on\r\nthe resolution adopted by the Security Council yesterday\r\nconcerning Kosovo. It was an example of unity and\r\nsolidarity, and I hope it will send a message to stop the\r\nbloodshed in that region and stop the activities of all those\r\nwho are trying to introduce violence, repression and\r\nterrorism there.\r\nThe OSCE has been able to engage in preventive\r\ndiplomacy. We have done so together; we have\r\nstrengthened our collective security together; we have\r\nfielded a host of projects in almost every imaginable sphere\r\nof human collective activity. In all fairness, one has to take\r\ninto consideration the conflicts avoided elsewhere in the\r\nBalkans, as well as in Central Asia and in the Caucasus.\r\nWe do not proclaim to be a model for others. The\r\norganization itself developed almost by chance, as a\r\nfortuitous assembly of the members of the two cold-war\r\nblocs. But we have been able to manage the transition and\r\nto set standards that we all try to maintain. Maybe other\r\nregions of conflicting interests could use some of our\r\nexperience, both the successes and the mistakes.\r\nIn the Middle East, we are facing a challenging and\r\ndifficult time. Poland is committed to a just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive peace in that region. Therefore, we are\r\ndeeply concerned by the stalemate in the peace process, and\r\nwe strongly support all efforts to revitalize it, on the basis\r\nof Security Council resolutions, the principles of the\r\nMadrid Conference and the Oslo accords.\r\nIn many aspects the world is now a safer and better\r\nplace to live in than it was a decade ago. But there are\r\nnew threats and dangers. We must deter and defeat\r\nterrorist acts. Poland continues to promote the idea of the\r\nelaboration of the comprehensive convention against\r\norganized crime, which should generate wide and efficient\r\ncooperation between States, since organized transnational\r\ncrime cannot be successfully suppressed by any State\r\nalone.\r\nBorderlines are blurred. Ordinary crime blends with\r\nthe organized underworld, which in turn intermingles with\r\nthe terrorist community, and that in turn finds support and\r\nrelief in more than one of the world’s capitals. Drugs and\r\nguns are replacing more conventional currencies as the\r\nuniversal currency of evil, profits from one serving to\r\npromote the dissemination of the other, in a concerted\r\nassault on human life itself. It is indeed a culture of death\r\nwhich seems to unite those who put guns and drugs into\r\nthe hands of the young and teach them to hate others\r\nbecause they are of the wrong faith, race or nation. We\r\ncannot counter that evil with the same decisiveness, haste\r\nand cunning. We can, however, continue to support the\r\nalternative: a culture of life, founded on respect for the\r\nindividual, his inalienable rights, dignity and freedom. In\r\nterms of everyday reality, this means that the determined\r\neffort of all States is required to implement the basic\r\nconventions guaranteeing these values — to implement\r\nthem at home and to refuse to tolerate their violations\r\nabroad.\r\nOf these conventions, perhaps none is more\r\nimportant than the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, whose fiftieth anniversary we have been solemnly\r\ncelebrating. And yet, among States whose representatives\r\nhave expressed their attachment to that document, not a\r\nfew deny their citizens the basic rights the Declaration\r\nguarantees. Obviously, the powerful political interests\r\nwhich lie behind such behaviour will not bow to simple\r\ndeclarations, nor will the international democratic\r\ncommunity use force to implement its values.\r\nIt is our deep conviction that we should continuously\r\nadapt United Nations human rights machinery to present\r\nand future developments in this area. The biggest\r\nchallenge we have been facing over recent years is the\r\nviolation of human rights in the context of armed\r\nconflicts and tensions of a domestic or civil character. For\r\nyears the international community has not been able to\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\ncope with this problem, although in the meantime the\r\nUnited Nations has developed a significant peacekeeping\r\ncapacity. It is only after the traumatic experience in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and in the Great Lakes region that the\r\napproach has changed.\r\n“No man is an island”; no State is an island.\r\nConnected, as the Polish writer whom I quoted said, by a\r\ncommon definition of our humanity, we cannot help but try\r\nto implement the noblest goal, incarnate in the name of this\r\nOrganization: the Nations United, in our common humanity,\r\nour planet and our future.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mesut Yilmaz, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Turkey\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\nan address by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nTurkey.\r\nMr. Mesut Yilmaz, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nTurkey, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mesut Yilmaz, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Yilmaz (Turkey): This is my first General\r\nAssembly as Prime Minister. I was here as Foreign\r\nMinister, when the waves of change were sweeping away\r\nthe cold-war era. I recall the optimism shared by many\r\nabout a more humane and harmonious international system.\r\nI remember the sounds of joy as freedom, democracy and\r\nthe market economy rang victorious on a global scale.\r\nIndeed, significant changes have taken place since\r\nthen. New States have joined the family of nations. A\r\nbroader and deeper commitment to contemporary values has\r\ntaken root. The international climate long dictated by\r\nideological divisions has withered away. At no time in\r\nrecent history have nations become so close to each other\r\naround shared values.\r\nYet this is not the full story. The late twentieth\r\ncentury is full of paradoxes and competing currents. For the\r\nfortunate among us, the world has never offered more —\r\nbetter education, better health care, greater prosperity. But\r\nthese fruits are denied to the vast majority of the planet’s\r\npopulation. The number of people who live in dire poverty\r\nis growing.\r\nAdmittedly, our overall security environment has\r\nimproved. But the resurgence of aggression, extreme\r\nethnic nationalism, tribalism, religious fundamentalism,\r\nracism, xenophobia and cultural discrimination pose new\r\nthreats to international peace and stability. Cultural and\r\nreligious intolerance is breeding more conflicts than ever\r\nbefore. International terrorism, openly sponsored by some\r\nStates, has become a formidable threat to civilized\r\nsocieties. The interconnected groups that engage in\r\nterrorism, organized crime and drug-smuggling challenge\r\nour security and well-being.\r\nThe threat of nuclear confrontation between the\r\nsuper-Powers has been eliminated; the danger of the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction still looms\r\non the horizon.\r\nThe two contradictory trends in the world — one\r\ntowards fragmentation and conflict, the other towards\r\nglobalization and cooperation — require a careful and\r\nsober analysis. This new dialectic defines the framework\r\nin which we have to operate. The integrity of the nation\r\nState, and the demands of an even more interdependent\r\nworld must be harmonized and balanced.\r\nThe United Nations was our collective response to\r\nthe challenges of the past. It was built on the ashes of the\r\nSecond World War. The bitter experiences of that war left\r\ntheir imprint on the Charter, the rules that govern its work\r\nand its structure. To its credit, this Organization has\r\nhelped bring peace, prosperity and hope to millions of\r\npeople around the globe. Indeed, over a span of 53 years\r\nthe United Nations has managed very complex\r\nhumanitarian emergencies, from civil wars to the mass\r\nmovement of refugees and health epidemics. For millions\r\nof people around the world, the United Nations is not a\r\nfaceless institution. It is the difference between peace and\r\nwar. It is food for those on the borderline of starvation\r\nand medicine to those on the brink of death. But, above\r\nall, the United Nations remains our hope for a better,\r\npeaceful and secure future.\r\nIn this time of challenge and change, the United\r\nNations is more important than ever. It is here at the\r\nUnited Nations that we must fight together against the\r\nforces of destruction. It is here that we must strive to\r\nstrengthen democratic institutions, to further promote and\r\nprotect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and\r\nto punish those responsible for crimes against humanity.\r\nIt is here that we must open the door to development\r\nfor many nations trapped in poverty. Their misery is a\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nchallenge to all of us. But, above all, the United Nations\r\nmust promote justice so that peace may endure.\r\nAs we stand at the threshold of a new millennium, it\r\nis our duty to chart a new course for the United Nations\r\nand set a common standard for the behaviour of nations.\r\nI suggest that we should focus greater effort on the\r\nfollowing areas.\r\nThe first is preventing conflicts in potential crisis\r\nareas. I believe there is no shortage of information on a\r\nbrewing crisis. By the time a crisis is addressed at the\r\nUnited Nations, it has already taken on critical proportions\r\nand often reached a point of no return. Bosnia is the most\r\ntragic example. Regional organizations should play a more\r\neffective role in defusing tensions from their onset.\r\nRegional organizations and the United Nations should\r\nestablish an effective mechanism for coordination and\r\nconsultation.\r\nThe second area is peace-building. We must devise a\r\nnew approach to peace-building to provide lasting security.\r\nEven when a ceasefire is holding or elections have taken\r\nplace, the social and institutional grounds appear to be very\r\nshaky. The United Nations must have both a programme\r\nand experts to help countries emerge from conflicts.\r\nThe third area is sustainable development. If the\r\nUnited Nations is to maintain its credibility for its\r\nMembers, it must enable people to lift themselves out of\r\npoverty. There must be more effective coordination between\r\nUnited Nations aid, international efforts and contributions\r\nfrom donor countries. Obviously, funding is a major\r\nconcern, but a coordinated and streamlined strategy is\r\nequally important.\r\nThe emphasis recently placed by the United Nations\r\non the problems of Africa is an encouraging starting point.\r\nIt should give direction to our efforts to eliminate poverty\r\nin all regions where we witness human misery.\r\nThe fourth area is one standard for all. Despite all\r\nsolemn declarations, international conventions and the legal\r\nframework, there seems to be no end in sight to\r\ndiscriminatory practices and double standards. The division\r\nof the world along religious, ethnic and cultural fault lines\r\nis an invitation to disaster. We must all ensure that no\r\nnation in the world feels discriminated against on the\r\ngrounds of its cultural or religious identity.\r\nMy final point pertains to the fight against terrorism.\r\nWe have to eliminate this major threat to our citizens and\r\nnations. I share the views expressed by President Clinton.\r\nWe have to place the combat against terrorism at the top\r\nof our agenda. There must be no excuses, no false\r\njustifications.\r\nThe demands on the United Nations have grown\r\nenormously. We all agree that reform is vital. We support\r\nthe Secretary-General in his substantive reforms. We\r\nbelieve that reform must be comprehensive. It must also\r\ninclude the reform of the Security Council. Piecemeal\r\nefforts and inadequate measures do not offer a solution.\r\nThe representative character of the Security Council must\r\nbe enhanced to meet the expectations of the largest\r\nsegment of the United Nations membership. The Council\r\nmust become more responsive and transparent. Reform\r\nmust render this organ more accountable, effective and\r\ndemocratic, so that it can exercise authority and offer\r\nmoral guidance.\r\nTurkish foreign policy is defined by a blend of our\r\nhistory, culture and geostrategic location at the crossroads\r\nof Asia and Europe. It corresponds to the aspirations of\r\nour people for peace, stability and prosperity. As a secular\r\ndemocratic country with a predominantly Muslim\r\npopulation, we combine our national heritage with a\r\nstrong commitment to modernism.\r\nOn all the issues and disputes that figure on the\r\nagenda of the international community, our policies are\r\nclear and consistent. We oppose aggression and believe\r\nthat any breach of international law and legitimacy must\r\nnot be condoned. We have always advocated the\r\nresolution of disputes through peaceful means and\r\ndialogue. Turkey has been an active actor in the efforts to\r\ncontribute to the peaceful settlement of outstanding\r\ndisputes. We participate extensively in peacekeeping and\r\npeace enforcement operations.\r\nWe live in a region where there are major currents\r\nof instability and conflict. Indeed, almost every major\r\nissue that consumes the international community — from\r\nthe Balkans to the Caucasus, from the Middle East to the\r\nGulf — affects our security and well-being. Conscious of\r\nthese challenges, we have assumed an important role in\r\ncontributing to the efforts aimed at peacefully resolving\r\nconflicts and preserving security and stability. We are\r\nactively promoting regional peace through regional\r\ncooperation initiatives. Both the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization\r\nare cases in point.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nThe Balkan region is a test case with regard to the\r\nchallenges we face in the post-cold-war era. It is here that\r\nwe must prove that multicultural and multi-ethnic societies\r\nhave a chance to live in peace and harmony. We thought\r\nthat we had all drawn our bitter lessons from the tragedy of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We must never allow it to happen\r\nagain.\r\nHowever, the recent violence in Kosovo is similar to\r\nwhat transpired in Bosnia and Herzegovina; it is of the\r\nsame making, the result of the same mentality. Within the\r\nterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\r\nKosovo must regain its autonomous status in a manner that\r\nsatisfies all the ethnic groups.\r\nRegional stability is a prerequisite for international\r\npeace. That is why we have taken a number of initiatives\r\nto resolve outstanding problems with some of our\r\nneighbours. A problem that has preoccupied Turkish-\r\nBulgarian relations for almost half a century has recently\r\nbeen resolved successfully in good faith by the two\r\ncountries. This achievement demonstrates vividly that even\r\nthe most complex issues can be resolved if there is political\r\nwill and courage on both sides.\r\nSeveral interrelated problems, mostly pertaining to the\r\nAegean and inherited from the past, continue to mar\r\nTurkish-Greek relations. It is our ardent hope that these\r\nquestions will be addressed between the two countries\r\nthrough a meaningful dialogue, without excluding any\r\nUnited Nations-agreed method of peaceful settlement. We\r\ncall upon the Government of Greece to dedicate itself to a\r\ndialogue with Turkey.\r\nThe question of Cyprus is at a critical juncture. The\r\ncourse pursued by Greece and the Greek Cypriots poses a\r\nserious threat to the security of the Turkish Republic of\r\nNorthern Cyprus and of Turkey. It is also detrimental to\r\npeace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean.\r\nOn the military front, the policies of the Greek/Greek\r\nCypriot camp have heightened tensions on the island. The\r\nclock is ticking for the deployment of the S-300 missile\r\nsystem.\r\nOn the political front, the decision of the European\r\nUnion to start accession negotiations with the Greek\r\nCypriot side has altered all the parameters and the\r\nestablished framework for a settlement. Regrettably, this\r\nprocess serves only to perpetuate the division of the island.\r\nTurkey fully supports the initiative tabled at this\r\ncritical time by President Denktaş on 31 August 1998.\r\nThis proposal of historic importance foresees the\r\nestablishment of a Cyprus confederation. We believe this\r\nproposal provides a perspective for a just and lasting\r\nsettlement. It corresponds to the realities of the island. It\r\nprotects the vital and legitimate interests of all the parties\r\nconcerned. It aims at preserving the integrity of the\r\nisland. It is in line with the United Nations approach to\r\nreaching a freely negotiated and mutually acceptable\r\nsettlement to the Cyprus issue.\r\nWe believe that the proposed confederation can\r\nfinally open an avenue for peace and reconciliation based\r\non a common destiny for the two peoples in Cyprus.\r\nThe impasse in the Middle East peace process and\r\nthe continuing plight of the Palestinian people are a\r\nsource of great concern for Turkey. An incomplete peace\r\nexposes the Middle East to the risks of further instability.\r\nIt also dims the prospects for the people of the region to\r\nenjoy an economically and socially sound future.\r\nTurkey is a friend of the Arab nations. We share a\r\ncommon history and a rich cultural heritage. We value\r\nthese strong bonds. Turkey is also a friend of Israel. We\r\nare, therefore, all the more concerned by the lack of\r\nprogress in bringing a permanent state of peace and\r\nstability to the Middle East.\r\nIn the same vein, we look forward to the\r\nreintegration into the international community of Iraq,\r\nwith its territorial integrity intact, through the full\r\nimplementation of the Security Council resolutions and\r\nthe lifting of the sanctions.\r\nThe crisis in Afghanistan also threatens peace and\r\nstability within the wider context of the region. The\r\nAfghan conflict can only be overcome through inter-\r\nAfghan dialogue and the establishment of a broad-based\r\nGovernment. The United Nations should have a central\r\nrole in this regard.\r\nThe overall situation in the Caucasus is a major\r\ndestabilizing factor. It has a direct bearing on our security\r\nand well-being. We call for the urgent settlement of the\r\nNagorny Karabakh dispute and the termination of the\r\nArmenian occupation of Azeri territory. The Armenian\r\nleadership must commit itself to the efforts of the Minsk\r\nGroup of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe. It is our sincere conviction that the interests of\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nthe Armenian people will be better served by focusing on\r\na peaceful future, rather than militancy.\r\nPeace and stability in the Caucasus also require the\r\nresolution of the Georgian/Abkhaz conflict, with full respect\r\nfor the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.\r\nAzerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia are our neighbours,\r\nwith which we wish to work together for our common\r\nprosperity and security.\r\nAt the threshold of a new millennium, our agenda for\r\nthe twenty-first century must be inspired by the vision of\r\nthe founding fathers. We must rededicate ourselves to the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter. We must fulfil our\r\npledge to succeeding generations. To this end, we must join\r\nour forces to maintain international peace and security.\r\nTurkey, for its part, is prepared to assume its share as\r\nan actor in the preservation of international peace, security\r\nand prosperity. In fact, I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto state from this rostrum that we are a serious contender\r\nfor the Security Council in the year 2000. Turkey is eager\r\nto place its assets at the service of regional and global\r\npeace and stability as a member of the Council.\r\nThe Charter is a contract among nations to combine\r\nour efforts to realize the aspirations and goals of the\r\npeoples of the world. It is high time that we fulfilled its\r\nterms. It is also time to build on the progress we have made\r\nfor the cause of peace, security and prosperity of the global\r\ncommunity. We must now give a new direction to our\r\nefforts. As the world turns a new leaf, let us rise to the\r\noccasion.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Turkey for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mesut Yilmaz, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nTurkey, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Nadezhda Mihailova, Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Bulgaria, to whom I give the\r\nfloor.\r\nMrs. Mihailova (Bulgaria): Allow me, on behalf of\r\nthe Bulgarian delegation, to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and to wish him every success in\r\nguiding this important session to tangible results.\r\nI would like also to express our appreciation to\r\nMr. Udovenko for the proficiency and insight with which\r\nhe presided over the fifty-second session.\r\nThe Republic of Bulgaria, as an associated country,\r\nhas aligned itself with the statement on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, delivered by Mr. Wolfgang Schüssel,\r\nVice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nAustria.\r\nWhile the search for new approaches and responses\r\nto the processes of globalization confronts humanity with\r\nnew challenges, existing cases of conflict, unrest and\r\nunderdevelopment bear the mark of the divisions and\r\nconfrontations of past decades. The question we have to\r\naddress now is whether the next millennium will be one\r\nof continued unrest and confrontation or one of peace and\r\nprosperity for all United Nations Member States, big or\r\nsmall.\r\nGlobalization and interdependence are bringing\r\nprofound changes to the world we live in. An increasing\r\nnumber of issues, such as the economic and financial\r\ncrisis, organized crime, terrorism and regional conflicts,\r\ncannot be effectively resolved by individual countries.\r\nTherefore, international cooperation is more necessary\r\nthan ever.\r\nToday we are combining our efforts against the new\r\nglobal threat, terrorism. But we must not forget that\r\nterrorism appears mainly in unstable regions or weak\r\ncountries, and from there spreads to the rest of the world.\r\nThat is why the problems of such unstable countries can\r\nneither remain their own responsibility, nor even\r\nproblems of their regions. The problems seem to be much\r\nmore global. The question today is how to combat the\r\ncriminal world, how to manage crisis and regional\r\nconflicts, how to feed and shelter refugees. Tomorrow the\r\nquestion will be how to guarantee democratic stability\r\nthrough long-term engagements. The other approach is\r\nonly to react to the consequences, thus adding new\r\nproblems. Such an approach does not solve the problem,\r\nbut becomes part of it; moreover the problem is\r\nmultiplied through its negative influence on neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\nWe also believe that economic security is an\r\nessential part of the framework in which our efforts to\r\nmake a better world are made. We are convinced that\r\nsecurity can be guaranteed not by “hot money”, but only\r\nthrough real, long-term investments, which are crucial for\r\na successful economic restructuring.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nBulgaria has managed to gain some knowledge and\r\nexperience in handling the problems of the reform process.\r\nIn the past year and a half the Government has managed to\r\nachieve: first, economic stability as a basis for moving\r\nforward with structural reform and sustainable economic\r\ngrowth; secondly, modernization of the public\r\nadministration; and, thirdly, efficient enforcement of the\r\nrule of law in civil society.\r\nResolute steps have been taken, in compliance with\r\nthe Government programme “Bulgaria — 2001”, to\r\ntranslate into practice the new foreign policy priorities. At\r\nits core are the integration of Bulgaria into the European\r\nand transatlantic political, economic and defence structures,\r\nand the creation of a climate of confidence, stability and\r\ncooperation in South-Eastern Europe.\r\nWe are now engaged in active diplomatic efforts\r\naimed at promoting the principles of democracy and\r\nstability in the region of South-Eastern Europe in order to\r\ncontribute to the peaceful settlement of conflicts. I would\r\nalso like to stress that my country has already achieved\r\nsignificant progress in another important area, combating\r\norganized crime and corruption and promoting regional\r\ncooperation in this field.\r\nLet me now address the complex situation in the\r\nBalkans. I would like to note the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the Dayton Agreement. We consider that\r\nthe extended presence of the Stabilization Force (SFOR)\r\nwould contribute to the consolidation of peace and stability\r\nin this region.\r\nBulgaria is particularly concerned about the continuing\r\ntension in Kosovo. The crisis has reached a point where\r\nthere is no more room for general statements and palliative\r\nsolutions. The conflict in Kosovo has resulted in\r\nthousands of civilian casualties. There is a serious threat of\r\ndeepening the crisis and a substantial risk of spillover to\r\nother parts of South-Eastern Europe. We are convinced that\r\nthe only credible instrument for solving the problem is\r\nnegotiations between the parties involved, which have to\r\nexamine in a responsible manner all proposals for a\r\npeaceful settlement. We support Security Council resolution\r\n1199 (1998) adopted yesterday.\r\nIt is worth pointing out that as early as last February\r\nBulgaria proposed that the countries generating stability in\r\nthe region should unite their efforts in search of a peaceful\r\nsolution to this problem. The joint declarations of the\r\nForeign Ministers of countries of South-Eastern Europe,\r\nadopted on the initiative of Bulgaria, reflect the will of\r\nthese countries to make their contribution to the efforts of\r\nthe Contact Group. They also illustrate the new spirit in\r\nrelations between the States in the region and their\r\nresponsible approach to security and stability. For the first\r\ntime in many years our countries managed to put aside\r\ntheir differences so as to elaborate and express a common\r\nposition on a problem of immediate concern. This\r\napproach sets the groundwork for the establishment of a\r\npolitico-diplomatic mechanism for crisis management and\r\nprevention.\r\nIn our view, those States which would like to\r\ncontribute to stability and security in the region have to\r\ntake into consideration the interests and positions of the\r\ncountries situated there. A common understanding has\r\nbeen expressed that any measures aimed at settling the\r\nproblems of the region, sanctions included, should take\r\ninto account the political and economic stability of South-\r\nEastern Europe. They should not infringe upon the\r\ninterests of the countries involved. Therefore, we believe\r\nthat efficient measures should be of a political, and not of\r\nan economic, character.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nAn issue of special relevance for Bulgaria and also, I\r\nbelieve, for other countries of the region, is the negative\r\nimpact on the national economy of the strict implementation\r\nof the economic sanctions imposed until recently by the\r\nSecurity Council on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As\r\nis well known, Bulgaria strictly abided by the Council’s\r\ndecisions, suffering as a result economic losses which have\r\nalmost been equal to Bulgaria’s foreign debt for three years.\r\nGiven the continued relevance of that issue internationally,\r\nBulgaria supports the view that since all provisions of the\r\nCharter are of equal importance, assistance to third States\r\naffected by sanctions has to be taken into consideration\r\ntogether with the imposition of sanctions. The elaboration\r\nof a concrete United Nations mechanism for this purpose is\r\ntherefore of the utmost importance.\r\nIt is incumbent upon the United Nations to find ways\r\nand means of alleviating the negative consequences of\r\nsanctions with regard to third States. It is our view that\r\ncloser and more direct participation in the whole process by\r\nall third States which could be adversely affected by the\r\nimposition of sanctions is necessary. We are confident that\r\ndiscussion of this issue at the present session will yield\r\nmore concrete results in accordance with the decisions\r\nalready adopted and the report of the Secretary-General to\r\nbe submitted under resolution 52/162.\r\nWe are convinced that lasting stability in South-\r\nEastern Europe is possible only through multilateral security\r\ncooperation coupled with effective economic,\r\ninfrastructural, cultural, information and other integrated\r\nlinks to other parts of Europe. In this regard, the expansion\r\nof the European and transatlantic organizations to South-\r\nEastern Europe will create a belt of security in the area and\r\nprevent possible regional crises in the future.\r\nAs an integral part of Europe, Bulgaria regards our\r\naccelerated accession to the European Union and full\r\nmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) as an expression of our political choice based on\r\nbroad public support. These priorities are embedded in the\r\nnational security concept approved by the Bulgarian\r\nparliament last April. Since Bulgaria is determined to\r\npromote and enhance the values of democracy, we are\r\ncertainly interested in ensuring that these values become\r\nwidely accepted throughout South-Eastern Europe.\r\nThe Republic of Bulgaria welcomes its inclusion in the\r\nprocess of enlargement of the European Union, together\r\nwith other associated countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope and Cyprus. The Bulgarian Government is fully\r\naware that our accession aspirations are contingent on the\r\nsuccess of the domestic, economic and legislative reforms.\r\nIt is against this background that a national strategy for\r\naccession to the European Union, outlining the main\r\nactivities of the country from a long-term perspective,\r\nwas adopted last March.\r\nThe Bulgarian Government has developed a clear-cut\r\nnational strategy to meet the criteria for NATO\r\nmembership, based on a comprehensive national\r\nprogramme of preparation which is being constantly\r\nupdated and optimized. Bulgaria has the political will and\r\nis undertaking concrete steps to fulfil in regional terms\r\nthe objectives of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council\r\nand the enhanced Partnership for Peace. Our positive\r\nattitude is reflected in the ongoing regional political\r\ndialogue and the practical follow-up measures to enhance\r\nregional security and defence cooperation in South-\r\nEastern Europe.\r\nWe consider multilateral confidence and security-\r\nbuilding measures to be an important aspect of political\r\ncooperation in the region. An important example of this\r\ncooperation is the initiative to create a multinational peace\r\nforce in South-Eastern Europe. In the course of the\r\nnegotiations on this project, Bulgaria proposed hosting the\r\njoint headquarters of the force in the Bulgarian city of\r\nPlovdiv. The establishment of the force will strengthen\r\nthe spirit of confidence and cooperation in the region.\r\nAnother key aspect of regional cooperation is the\r\nprocess of good-neighbourly relations, stability, security\r\nand cooperation in South-Eastern Europe initiated at the\r\nMeeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nCountries of South-Eastern Europe in Sofia in 1996.\r\nAnnual ministerial meetings have been held since then, as\r\nwell as a number of specialized expert meetings devoted\r\nto issues of common interest in various fields, including\r\ntransport, energy, transborder cooperation, combating\r\norganized crime and drug-trafficking.\r\nClosely linked to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security is the fight against terrorism and\r\ninternational crime. We condemn all terrorist acts and\r\nlament the loss of life and the destruction inflicted by\r\nthem. The most recent deplorable examples of such acts\r\nwere the horrible bomb attacks in some African countries.\r\nWe share the view that the threat of terrorism requires a\r\ndecisive and joint response by the whole international\r\ncommunity. Bulgaria supports the activities of the United\r\nNations aimed at setting norms and standards for the fight\r\nagainst terrorism and international crime through\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nnegotiating various legal instruments and creating the\r\nappropriate institutions for this purpose.\r\nWe consider that successfully combating terrorism and\r\norganized crime in some countries cannot be achieved\r\nthrough the efforts of their Governments alone. It requires\r\nthe effective involvement of other States, which have the\r\nmeans and the experience in this field. Bulgaria fully\r\nsupports the recent initiative by France and Great Britain to\r\nconvene a high-level conference in London this autumn\r\naimed at depriving terrorists of their support. We note with\r\nappreciation that on 18 July this year, the Diplomatic\r\nConference in Rome adopted the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court. I would like to reiterate my country’s\r\nconfidence that the establishment in the foreseeable future\r\nof the International Criminal Court will be an efficient step\r\ntowards deterring possible perpetrators from committing\r\nterrorist acts.\r\nThe broadening of the human aspect of development\r\nthrough democracy and participation has been widely\r\naccepted and has become one of the priorities of United\r\nNations activities. This year we celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nand the fifth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action. The principle of the indivisibility of\r\nuniversally recognized civil, political, economic, social and\r\ncultural rights continues to be a key element of today’s\r\nsystem for the promotion and protection of human rights\r\nand freedoms. The designation of 1998 as the International\r\nYear for Human Rights could stimulate a further\r\nrestructuring of United Nations human rights activities,\r\nstrengthening the staff of and securing adequate financial\r\nresources for the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. In this respect we would\r\nlike to commend the relevant measures taken by the High\r\nCommissioner, Mrs. Mary Robinson, and to reiterate our\r\nsupport for her efforts to this end.\r\nBetter implementation of international standards could\r\nbe achieved by improving the existing mechanisms and by\r\nopen dialogue on most sensitive issues, including those\r\nrelated to human rights in individual States. Accordingly,\r\nthe Bulgarian Government attaches great importance to the\r\nenjoyment of all human rights by Bulgarians living abroad\r\nand considers respect for their rights to be an essential\r\nelement for the enhancement of bilateral relations.\r\nBulgaria supports the ongoing process of reform\r\npursued consistently by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\r\nand aimed at the streamlining and strengthening of the\r\nOrganization and at making it more efficient and responsive\r\nto the new realities. One of the substantial issues of\r\noverall United Nations reform is the question of\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council. Bulgaria reiterates its willingness to\r\nsupport such an enlargement of the Council, which could\r\nguarantee its effectiveness and enhance its capacity to\r\nmaintain international peace and security. In our view the\r\nenlargement should envisage the preservation of the\r\nbalance between the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers, as well as among regional groups. As the\r\nmembership of the Group of Eastern European States has\r\ndoubled in the last decade, an additional non-permanent\r\nseat for this group should be secured. A decision on the\r\nenlargement of the Council and on its working methods\r\nshould be supported by the broadest possible consensus,\r\nincluding all the Council’s permanent members.\r\nBulgaria attaches great importance to the activities\r\nof the United Nations in the field of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and is closely following the United Nations\r\ndialogue and the activities of United Nations bodies and\r\nagencies on the issues of demography, social\r\ndevelopment, women and narcotic drugs. The special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on narcotic drugs, held\r\nin June of this year, merits particular mention in this\r\nregard. That session reflected the determination of\r\nMember States to combine their efforts in the fight\r\nagainst drugs, and its results contributed to the common\r\neffort to achieve sustainable development.\r\nAs a country with an economy in transition, Bulgaria\r\ncooperates actively with the United Nations system of\r\nspecialized agencies and programmes. Our interest is to\r\ndevelop this cooperation further. We are looking forward\r\nto more streamlined activities thanks to the potential of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for\r\ncapacity-building and assistance in the development and\r\nexecution of joint projects. At the same time, the basic\r\nprinciples of universality and primary responsibility of\r\nGovernments for the process should be preserved. In this\r\nregard the system of resident coordinators and the effort\r\nto make this more operational will play an important role.\r\nHere I would like to express our satisfaction with the\r\nperformance of the UNDP office in Sofia.\r\nFor Bulgaria, development and economic growth will\r\nbe impossible without full participation in world\r\neconomic and financial exchanges. In our opinion, the\r\nUnited Nations and its institutions could be more strongly\r\ninvolved in the solution of the specific problems of\r\neconomic transition and reforms.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 24 September 1998\r\nDisarmament issues continue to have an important\r\nplace in overall efforts to secure a better world for future\r\ngenerations. We agree with the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, that disarmament is at the centre of our mission of\r\npeace and development, and we welcome his decision to re-\r\nestablish the Department for Disarmament Affairs. The\r\nBulgarian Government attaches high priority to international\r\nefforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nWe call for an early entry into force of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) as an important step in\r\nthat direction, and support the decision of the Conference\r\non Disarmament to establish an ad hoc committee to\r\nconduct negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. In\r\nthis context, we were deeply concerned by the nuclear tests\r\nconducted by India and by Pakistan earlier this year.\r\nBulgaria has associated itself with statements by the\r\npresidency of the European Union calling on India and\r\nPakistan to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and to sign the CTBT, as well as\r\nto participate in negotiations on a fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty with the aim of maintaining a strong global non-\r\nproliferation regime.\r\nWe favour the strengthening of the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling\r\nof Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\r\nTheir Destruction, and believe that further acceleration of\r\nthe negotiations and an early conclusion of the protocol to\r\nthe Convention is required.\r\nAs a State party to the Convention on the Prohibition\r\nof the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, Bulgaria\r\nwould like to contribute to enlarging the number of\r\naccessions to the Convention in order to achieve recognition\r\nof the prohibition of chemical weapons as a universal norm\r\nof international law. As a concrete effort to this end,\r\nBulgaria will host a regional seminar on the issue later this\r\nmonth.\r\nWith regard to conventional arms, anti-personnel\r\nlandmines are widely recognized as a pernicious weapon\r\nwhich indiscriminately kills and maims hundreds of\r\nthousands of people worldwide. Convinced of the need\r\nfor a total prohibition of anti-personnel mines, on 29 July\r\nthis year the Bulgarian Parliament ratified the Convention\r\non the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, thus contributing to its early entry into force.\r\nWe are also ready to contribute to the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to reduce conventional weapons,\r\nincluding small arms, and especially their excessive and\r\ndestabilizing accumulation in areas of conflict. We regard\r\nuniversal participation in the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms as an important step towards effective\r\ntransparency, both on a regional and a global scale.\r\nIn the context of the new challenges in the field of\r\ninternational peace and security, United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations continue to be an essential\r\nelement in the Organization’s activities. My country\r\nappreciates the efforts of the Secretary-General to ensure\r\nwide support for these and to put in place the necessary\r\narrangements that will enable the United Nations to\r\ndeploy peacekeeping forces rapidly and effectively in\r\nareas of conflict. We are convinced that the new\r\ngeneration of peacekeeping operations should include in\r\ntheir mandates a proportional combination of political,\r\nmilitary, humanitarian, reconstruction and other relevant\r\nactivities. In this regard, we believe that there are still\r\nunused opportunities to strengthen United Nations\r\ncooperation with regional organizations in the field of\r\npreventive diplomacy, crisis management and\r\npeacekeeping.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to declare my\r\ncountry’s readiness to cooperate actively with all other\r\nMember States in the successful implementation of the\r\nlofty goals of the present session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are confident that our discussions on the\r\nimportant agenda items before us will be translated into\r\npractical measures.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.45 p.m.\r\n31\r\n"
