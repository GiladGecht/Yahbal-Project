(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Kocharian, President of the\r\nRepublic of Armenia\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Armenia.\r\nMr. Robert Kocharian, President of the Republic of\r\nArmenia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Armenia, His Excellency Mr. Robert\r\nKocharian, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kocharian (interpretation from Russian):\r\nMay I begin, Sir, by congratulating you on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nI am confident that the skills and vast experience you have\r\nacquired throughout your distinguished diplomatic career\r\nwill provide the guidance we need to guarantee the\r\nsuccessful outcome of the session. I must also recall the\r\nvaluable contribution of your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko, to the work of the last session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThis year, 1998, has been a year of warning signals\r\nand signs of hope. We have witnessed both setbacks and\r\nstrides forward in the quest for peace and international\r\nsecurity. In particular, we have witnessed great progress\r\ntowards the settlement of one of the longest and most\r\nintractable conflicts — that of Northern Ireland. The Irish\r\npeace agreement has proved to the world that it is never\r\ntoo late to find answers to seemingly impossible\r\nproblems.\r\nUnfortunately, wars, armed conflicts, acts of\r\nterrorism and other forms of violence have shaken the\r\nworld during this last year and have had a negative\r\nimpact on international stability and security.\r\nA party to all international treaties in the sphere of\r\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nArmenia is deeply concerned about the possible\r\nconsequences of nuclear tests conducted by India and\r\nPakistan this year. We believe that as the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) comes into force, it will\r\ncontribute substantially to the strengthening of\r\ninternational security. Also, within the framework of the\r\nConference on Disarmament, Armenia supports drafting\r\nagreements on the prohibition of the production of fissile\r\nmaterials for nuclear weapons and other explosive\r\ndevices.\r\nThe United Nations plays a great role in different\r\naspects of international life, ranging from tackling global\r\nenvironmental problems to combating organized crime\r\nand illicit drug trafficking. In support of United Nations\r\nactivities in these spheres, Armenia actively participated\r\nin the twentieth special session of the General Assembly.\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nWe strongly believe that the illicit traffic in drugs and\r\npsychotropic substances seriously jeopardizes the economic\r\nprosperity and political stability of many countries and\r\nregions of the world.\r\nArmenia also actively participated in activities leading\r\nto the establishment of the International Criminal Court,\r\nsince we attach great importance to the battle against\r\ninternational crime, including the crime of genocide, crimes\r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. Believing that the United\r\nNations should play the leading role in the formation of an\r\ninternational anti-criminal strategy, Armenia supports the\r\nidea of holding, in Vienna, in the year 2000, the tenth\r\nUnited Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and\r\nTreatment of Offenders.\r\nArmenia unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism\r\nas acts that have no justification on political, ideological,\r\nethnic, religious or any other grounds. The recent terrorist\r\nattacks in Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania once\r\nagain show us the necessity for cooperation among all\r\ncountries to combat that evil. We call for the accession of\r\nthe maximum number of countries to universal conventions\r\nagainst terrorism, and support the Russian proposal on a\r\nUnited Nations convention for combating acts of nuclear\r\nterrorism. Armenia likewise supports including on the\r\nagenda of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly\r\nissues dealing with the declaration by the United Nations of\r\na decade of international law, as well as events to be\r\norganized in 1999 devoted to the hundredth anniversary of\r\nthe first International Peace Conference.\r\nFor the international community, this year marks the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. The semi-centennial anniversary of the Declaration\r\nenables the States Members of the United Nations to\r\nconduct a review of human rights conditions in their own\r\ncountries and to identify ways further to develop the\r\nfoundations of democracy and to promote human and\r\nnational rights.\r\nThis year also marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nadoption of the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is well known that\r\nthe international community did not, at the time, duly\r\ncondemn the genocide of Armenians in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire in 1915, and that failure encouraged certain regimes\r\nto commit new crimes of genocide. After the Holocaust, the\r\nUnited Nations addressed the problem of genocide, defining\r\nit as a crime against humanity, and adopted, on 9 December\r\n1948, the aforementioned Convention. Despite that fact,\r\nover the past five decades, crimes of genocide have been\r\ncommitted in various parts of the world on more than one\r\noccasion. The recent recognition and condemnation by\r\nseveral parliaments of the genocide of Armenians\r\ncommitted early in this century is evidence of an\r\nincreased understanding of the necessity to combat that\r\nevil.\r\nThe General Assembly, upon the submission of\r\nArmenia and five other Member States, included on the\r\nagenda of this session an item on the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the genocide Convention. We hope that, by combining\r\nits efforts in the struggle against the crime of genocide,\r\nhumanity will take a decisive step towards the elimination\r\nof that crime in the next century.\r\nEquality and mutually beneficial cooperation among\r\ncountries in the political and commercial-economic\r\nspheres, based on free market principles, should become\r\nan important factor for political stability in the third\r\nmillennium. We have no other choice. Armenia adheres\r\nto this policy in all its dealings, from its approach to\r\ncooperation with international organizations to the process\r\nof becoming a member of the World Trade Organization.\r\nWe attach special significance to regional\r\ncooperation, be it in the framework of the Commonwealth\r\nof Independent States, the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation organization or the TRASECA project.\r\nArmenia is sincerely open to such cooperation, although\r\nwe have to state with regret that the blockade imposed on\r\nArmenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan is a serious obstacle\r\nto such cooperation. It is obvious that the region’s vast\r\npotential cannot be fully exploited if attempts are made to\r\nisolate one of its constituents. Such attempts are doomed\r\nto failure.\r\nAnother factor of concern for political-military\r\nstability in the region is the gross violation by Azerbaijan\r\nof the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.\r\nIn three categories of ground equipment identified in the\r\nTreaty, our neighbour significantly surpasses the national\r\nlimits set by the Treaty.\r\nDespite the potential threat to our security, since the\r\nearliest days of our independence we have clearly and\r\nunambiguously forsworn the development of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and adhere to the principles of non-\r\nproliferation of such weapons and of control over the\r\ndestabilizing accumulation of conventional arms.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of regional conflicts is one\r\nof the most important safeguards of stability and peace in\r\nour region, the Transcaucasus. Armenia is committed to\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nthe ceasefire established in the Karabakh zone of conflict in\r\nMay 1994 and will assist in its rigorous maintenance. We\r\nemphasize the contribution of the Minsk Group and of its\r\nindividual member States, both to the maintenance of the\r\nceasefire and to mediation.\r\nUnfortunately, at present, the negotiation process is at\r\nan impasse. We believe that the main reasons for this\r\nimpasse are the unclear definition of Nagorny Karabakh’s\r\nstatus as a party to the negotiations; Azerbaijan’s refusal to\r\nnegotiate directly with the leaders of Nagorny Karabakh;\r\nand its insistence on preconditions regarding the future\r\nstatus of Nagorny Karabakh, which we believe must be\r\nnegotiated. The international community must make every\r\neffort to overcome these obstacles.\r\nIn our opinion, given the intensity and specifics of the\r\nNagorny Karabakh conflict, its resolution demands\r\nunconventional approaches based on the principle of equal\r\nlegal rights for the parties to the conflict, an end to the\r\nenclave status of Nagorny Karabakh and the provision of\r\ninternational security guarantees for its population. Armenia\r\nis ready to move forward and calls on Azerbaijan to resume\r\nnegotiations without preconditions in order to reach a\r\ncomprehensive settlement for the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nconflict.\r\nThe challenges that the international community faces\r\ntoday are diverse and complicated. We are convinced that\r\nonly a reformed United Nations can cope successfully and\r\neffectively with the increasing number of problems. This\r\nholds true especially for the reform of the Security Council,\r\nsince the maintenance of peace and security throughout the\r\nworld depends on a Security Council that functions\r\neffectively. We also call for deeper institutional reform of\r\nthe United Nations, including in the administrative-\r\nbudgetary sphere. We believe that the fulfilment by all\r\nMember States of their financial obligations under the\r\nUnited Nations Charter is indispensable if the\r\nOrganization’s acute financial crisis is to be overcome.\r\nDespite serious economic hardships, Armenia will fulfil its\r\nduties in this sphere. We need only recognize that a\r\nstronger and reformed United Nations serves our common\r\ninterests.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Armenia for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Robert Kocharian, President of the Republic of\r\nArmenia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus, His Excellency Mr. Glafcos Clerides,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Clerides: I would like to extend my\r\nwarmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of this body. I have no doubt that your\r\ndiplomatic experience and proven leadership will guide us\r\nsuccessfully in our work.\r\nAllow me also to thank your predecessor,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the determined\r\nleadership with which he steered the work of the fifty-\r\nsecond session.\r\nThe United Nations, being the primary vehicle for\r\nthe pursuit of world peace, has striven throughout its\r\nexistence to make the world a better place to live in.\r\nDespite adversities of all kinds, caused particularly by\r\nopposing national interests, violent conflicts, natural\r\ndisasters and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the United Nations has pursued consistently\r\nthe noble goals enshrined in its Charter, first and foremost\r\nthe elimination of the scourge of war and the achievement\r\nof economic development.\r\nTo be realistic, however, the hopes of mankind for\r\na new and genuinely just international legal and political\r\norder, generated by the demise of the bipolar world, are\r\nyet to be realized.\r\nCyprus reaffirms its commitment to work closely\r\nwith the other members of the Organization for the\r\nattainment of our common goals. We support, therefore,\r\nthe reform efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nAnnan, to streamline the operations of the Organization in\r\na way that assures its ability to pursue its goals, meet new\r\nchallenges and safeguard its financial position. We stress\r\nonce more the importance of restructuring the Security\r\nCouncil to make it more representative and transparent.\r\nCyprus welcomes the adoption of the Statute of a\r\npermanent International Criminal Court, empowering it to\r\nbring to justice the perpetrators of most serious crimes and\r\nviolations of humanitarian law. In this respect, we consider\r\nthe first-ever judgement by the international criminal court\r\nfor Rwanda on the crime of genocide a very important step.\r\nOf special concern is the rising number of refugees\r\nand internally displaced persons. Their plight calls not only\r\nfor international cooperation in providing protection and\r\nhumanitarian assistance, but also for addressing the root\r\ncauses of displacement. We continue to believe that the best\r\nsolution is the return of refugees to their homes in\r\nconditions of safety, with full protection of their human\r\nrights.\r\nCyprus condemns terrorism, which it considers a\r\nmenace to humanity, requiring effective international action\r\nand solutions on the basis of international law and the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be\r\ncharacterized by lack of progress and obstacles to the\r\nimplementation of the peace accords. The current stalemate\r\nposes a threat to the stability of the region. Cyprus, a\r\nneighbouring State with close relations to the parties\r\ninvolved, reiterates its support for the achievement of a just,\r\nlasting and comprehensive settlement based on the relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions.\r\nI would like to reiterate my country’s support for the\r\ndocuments adopted at the General Assembly special session\r\non the world drug problem and for the relevant efforts of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nCyprus welcomes the recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the situation in Africa. His recommendations\r\nmerit serious consideration and support by the international\r\ncommunity. We believe that the international community\r\nshould redouble its efforts towards assisting African\r\ncountries, with special attention given to debt relief, so that\r\nthey can avoid further instability and the danger of\r\nmarginalization.\r\nCyprus joined in the worldwide rejoicing over the\r\nagreement of last April concerning Northern Ireland. It is\r\nimportant for the sides to honour their responsibilities and\r\nmeet their commitments. We condemn acts of violence,\r\nwhich should not be allowed to block the road to peace,\r\nreconciliation and prosperity.\r\nCyprus supports strongly the efforts in the area of\r\narms control and disarmament. Since my last appearance\r\nbefore this body, we have ratified the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention; we have also signed, and will soon ratify, the\r\nConvention on anti-personnel mines. I should emphasize\r\nin this respect that, in spite of the difficult situation we\r\nface because of the presence of an occupation army force\r\nof 36,000 troops, Cyprus has decided to sign the\r\nConvention as an expression of our determination to join\r\nthe forces struggling to eliminate this utterly cruel method\r\nof war. We are grateful to Canada for promising to\r\nfinance the undertaking to clear the minefields along the\r\nceasefire line in our country.\r\nThe United Nations has a special role to play in the\r\npromotion of the well-being of small States. Small States\r\nare often exposed to a much greater degree than larger\r\nStates to threats because of increased vulnerability of their\r\nenvironment and security.\r\nIn this connection, Cyprus has suffered for more\r\nthan 24 years the grave consequences of the Turkish\r\ninvasion and the continuing occupation of more than one\r\nthird of its territory. Despite the pronounced will of the\r\ninternational community through numerous resolutions\r\nand the willingness of the Greek Cypriot side to negotiate\r\nin good faith, no solution of the Cyprus problem has\r\nresulted. It is, therefore, reasonable to ask why. The\r\nanswer is: It is because of the non-implementation and\r\nflagrant violation of Security Council and General\r\nAssembly resolutions by Turkey.\r\nI feel that it is necessary to give some examples of\r\nthese flagrant violations which prevented solution of the\r\nCyprus problem. Security Council and General Assembly\r\nresolutions calling for respect for the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and non-\r\nrecognition of the Turkish Cypriot breakaway entity were\r\nviolated by Turkey, which is the only State which\r\nrecognized the Turkish Cypriot secessionist entity, and\r\nwhich sustains it financially and militarily.\r\nAs regards Security Council and General Assembly\r\nresolutions, calling for the speedy withdrawal of all\r\nforeign armed forces and personnel from the Republic of\r\nCyprus, not only have the Turkish armed forces and\r\npersonnel not been withdrawn, but they have been\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nincreased and upgraded, to such an extent that the previous\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, described in\r\nhis report to the Security Council the occupied area of\r\nCyprus as one of the most militarized areas in the world.\r\nUnited Nations resolutions for the return of the\r\nrefugees to their homes under conditions of safety were not\r\nimplemented, not only because Turkish forces prevented the\r\nrefugees from returning, but also because Turkey, violating\r\nother provisions of United Nations resolutions calling on all\r\nparties concerned to avoid any action to change the\r\ndemographic composition of the population of Cyprus,\r\nimported to Cyprus thousands of illegal settlers from\r\nTurkey, usurped the properties of the refugees and installed\r\nsettlers in them. I could go on giving examples of gross\r\nviolations of United Nations resolutions by Turkey, but in\r\norder to confine myself to the time limits allowed, I will\r\nrefer only to the latest violation.\r\nThe recent demand of the Turkish Cypriot leader,\r\nMr. Denktaş, in the presence of the Turkish Foreign\r\nMinister, violates all United Nations resolutions, which call\r\nfor a bizonal-bicommunal federation, with a single\r\nsovereignty, international personality and citizenship, and is\r\naimed at derailing the negotiating process from the base of\r\nthe United Nations resolutions on Cyprus, and also at\r\nextinguishing the independence of the Republic of Cyprus\r\nand creating, under the guise of a Turkish Cypriot\r\nRepublic, a Turkish colony in Cyprus or, to say the least,\r\na Turkish protectorate.\r\nThe non-implementation of United Nations resolutions\r\non Cyprus tarnishes the image of the United Nations and its\r\nmain bodies. The former Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, in one of his reports to the Security Council,\r\nidentified as a cause of the absence of progress in Cyprus\r\nthe lack of political will on the part of the Turkish side.\r\nWith that report the diagnosis of the causes of the\r\nfailure to make progress towards a solution is completed. Is\r\nit too much for the people of Cyprus to ask what the next\r\nstep will be? Will the United Nations finally take the\r\nnecessary action to apply the required remedy in order to\r\nput an end to the tragedy that has befallen our small State\r\nand that has continued for 24 years?\r\nThe international community should not allow one\r\nState to violate for so long its expressed will. The Security\r\nCouncil, the main organ for international peace and\r\nsecurity, should proceed to examine how to implement its\r\nresolutions as soon as possible.\r\nI now want to address the problem of Cyprus, not by\r\nlooking at the past, but by outlining my goals for the\r\nfuture. The Cyprus problem has been with us for over 40\r\nyears. Today, the two communities of Cyprus are led by\r\nthe generation that was involved in the earliest stages of\r\nthe Cyprus problem. This generation knows both the joys\r\nof friendships that crossed communal lines and the\r\ntragedies and suffering that also crossed communal lines.\r\nRauf Denktaş and I are both members of this\r\ngeneration, which has seen the best and the worst of the\r\nrecent history of Cyprus. Our communities have entrusted\r\nus with their respective leaderships. The people of\r\nCyprus, both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, look\r\nto us, their leaders, to help shape a future that is better\r\nthan the present and that will not allow for a repetition of\r\nthe past.\r\nLet me offer my vision for the future. I want all\r\nCypriots to have security in their homes and their\r\ncommunities; I want all Cypriots to pursue their\r\nlivelihoods free of economic restrictions and the fear of\r\ninstability; I want all Cypriot children to know their\r\ndistinct cultural and religious heritage and to be able to\r\ncarry their identity and political rights into the future\r\nwithout fear of domination from any quarter.\r\nThe solution to any constitutional problem on the\r\nbasis of communal or ethnic criteria and federalism\r\ncontains elements of partnership and political equality of\r\nthe constituent parts.\r\nThe solution to the Cyprus problem on the basis of\r\na bicommunal-bizonal federation requires such a\r\npartnership of the two communities as would\r\nconstitutionally provide for a maximum degree of internal\r\nself-administration for the two constituent cantons,\r\nprovinces or States, and, adhering to the principle of the\r\nequal political status of the constituent parts, it must\r\nprovide them with the same rights, powers and functions\r\nregarding their respective separate, internal self-\r\nadministration. The constitution must also provide for\r\neffective participation of the constituent parts in the\r\nfederal government. It must also secure all fundamental\r\nhuman rights and freedoms for all the citizens of the\r\nfederation. Above all, it must safeguard the single\r\nsovereignty, the indivisibility and the unity of the\r\nbicommunal-bizonal federation. Such a federation,\r\nbecoming a member of the European Union, will thrive\r\nat home and abroad.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nOne of the questions we should ask when looking at\r\nvarious ideas for a solution is: Do they reasonably meet the\r\nneeds of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, and\r\nwill they promote stability and encourage cooperation and\r\npartnership among the people of Cyprus?\r\nIt is obvious that a bicommunal solution must be\r\nnegotiated, not only because all United Nations resolutions\r\nso demand, but also because only in negotiations can we\r\nwork out the practical steps needed to realize a functioning\r\nsolution.\r\nSecurity for both communities is a fundamental part of\r\nany settlement; this will require arrangements special to\r\nCyprus. To be effective, an agreement to this end must\r\nproduce a settlement that can meet the real life challenges\r\ninherent to a small island State.\r\nI believe that the gap between what ordinary Turkish\r\nCypriots and Greek Cypriots want and need in a settlement\r\nis not so great as it might appear. Both want the same\r\nthings: peace, prosperity, stability and physical, political,\r\neconomic and cultural security, including respect for and\r\nenjoyment of their homes and properties.\r\nI am confident that, working together under the\r\numbrella of the United Nations and with the help of the\r\ninternational community, Greek Cypriots and Turkish\r\nCypriots can construct a settlement that meets these needs\r\nand removes the fears and insecurities that have plagued\r\nCyprus since the middle part of this century. To do this, we\r\nmust begin serious negotiations.\r\nI believe that we, the current generation of leadership,\r\nmust negotiate a settlement to our decades-old problem that\r\nwill give all the people of Cyprus a future that will ensure\r\nthat the bitter experiences of the past cannot and shall not\r\nbe repeated. We, the older generation of both communities,\r\nmust close this sad chapter of Cyprus’s history with an\r\nagreement between us which will allow generations to come\r\nto build and realize the fruits of true partnership, based on\r\nmutual respect and political understanding.\r\nWhile we cannot reconcile ourselves with the Turkish\r\ninvasion and occupation, we are genuinely determined to\r\nrenew and invigorate bicommunal confidence and trust,\r\ncooperation and interaction with our Turkish Cypriot\r\ncompatriots. In my investiture speech last February, I\r\nextended a hand of friendship and urged the Turkish\r\nCypriot leader, Mr. Denktaş, to join me in working together\r\ntowards finding a solution to the tragic problem of Cyprus\r\nfor the benefit of all the citizens of the island. Similarly, I\r\ninvited the Turkish Cypriots to participate as full\r\nmembers in the Cypriot delegation negotiating the\r\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union, thus shaping\r\ntogether our positions and common destiny.\r\nToday, before the representatives of the international\r\ncommunity and from the podium of this Assembly,\r\nadhering to the will of the international community for an\r\nagreed solution to the Cyprus problem within the\r\nparameters set forth in United Nations resolutions, as\r\nleader of the Greek Cypriot community, I renew my\r\ninvitation to the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community,\r\nMr. Rauf Denktaş, to work together for the solution of the\r\nCyprus problem in order to build a happy and prosperous\r\nisland for our children and future generations. The\r\ninterests of Cyprus lie in the unity and interaction of the\r\ntwo communities. The continuing tension prevents Cyprus\r\nand its people from assuming their rightful role and\r\nmaking their contribution to regional stability and the\r\nimprovement of Greco-Turkish relations.\r\nThe Government of Cyprus is committed to a\r\npeaceful solution, on the basis of the United Nations\r\nresolutions, which will safeguard the interests and the\r\nhuman rights of all its citizens.\r\nWe have consistently put forward proposals for the\r\nreduction of tension on the island.\r\nTension in Cyprus escalates because of the massive\r\npresence of the Turkish occupation forces in the north,\r\ntheir continuous strengthening and upgrading, and the\r\ncorresponding need the Government of the Republic feels\r\nto strengthen its defences.\r\nThe Security Council, recognizing that the increase\r\nin tension is due to the build-up of military forces, has\r\ncalled in a number of its resolutions for the reduction of\r\nforces and armaments.\r\nWhile the Government of the Republic of Cyprus\r\nwill continue to exercise its sovereign right to strengthen\r\nits defences with whatever means it considers necessary\r\nfor as long as Turkish occupation forces remain in\r\nCyprus, I have not failed, in response to Security Council\r\nresolutions, to suggest concrete ways and measures to\r\nwork for a specific programme of reduction of foreign\r\nand local forces and equipment as a necessary preparatory\r\nstep for the programmed and final withdrawal of all\r\nforeign forces and other elements and for the\r\ndemilitarization of Cyprus. These proposals and\r\nsuggestions, on our part, are still valid and timely, and as\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nsuch they remain on the negotiating table. We remain\r\ncommitted to a solution to the problem by peaceful means,\r\nand for this a lessening of tension is a necessary ingredient.\r\nIn the face of continuous threats against Cyprus by the\r\nvastly superior military might of Turkey, whose ultimate\r\naim is to keep the island a perpetual hostage, to destroy its\r\nsovereignty and to reduce it to a Turkish protectorate, the\r\nstrong, principled support of United Nations Members is of\r\nparamount importance.\r\nAt this point, I wish to thank the Foreign Ministers of\r\nthe five permanent members of the Security Council and\r\nthe Secretary-General for discussing the Cyprus problem on\r\n24 September 1998 and for issuing a statement calling for\r\nan early resumption of a sustained process of direct\r\nnegotiations between the two communities, reminding them\r\nat the same time of the need to achieve a comprehensive\r\npolitical settlement in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolutions and to avoid any actions which might increase\r\ntension.\r\nI reply “Yes” to the resumption of a sustained process\r\nof direct negotiations on the basis of Security Council\r\nresolutions; I reply “Yes” to avoiding any action that might\r\nincrease tension and thus jeopardize progress in the\r\nnegotiating process.\r\nWe trust that we can rely once again on the active\r\nsolidarity of Members at this crucial juncture, as the most\r\nsacred principles of the United Nations Charter and the\r\ncredibility of the world public order itself come into focus\r\nin this respect.\r\nAs we approach the new millennium, the leaders of\r\nthe world must decide what kind of world we want our\r\nchildren and grandchildren to live in. Is it a world of sheer\r\ninterests and lack of principles, where cold calculations of\r\neconomic and strategic interests are pre-eminent, or a world\r\ngoverned by justice and respect for human rights, which is\r\nthe only solution for permanent peace and stability in the\r\nworld?\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nMr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister of Foreign Affairs and\r\nTrade of New Zealand, His Excellency the Right\r\nHonourable Donald Charles McKinnon, on whom I now\r\ncall.\r\nMr. McKinnon (New Zealand): May I start, Sir, by\r\ncongratulating Mr. Opertti on his election as President of\r\nthis great Assembly, and wishing him well as he guides\r\nits deliberations. I was privileged to visit his country,\r\nUruguay, earlier this year, and appreciated the warmth\r\nand hospitality on that occasion.\r\nI would also like to express our thanks to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who, with\r\nconsiderable commitment, presided over the introduction\r\nof many important reform measures during the past\r\nsession.\r\nEach year this debate provides an opportunity to take\r\na longer perspective on the United Nations — to look\r\nback and, of course, to look ahead. We have\r\nachievements to acknowledge and challenges for the\r\nfuture to consider. In doing so, our view is informed by\r\npresent-day conditions. We are living in very difficult\r\ntimes. The economic events that have unfolded over the\r\nlast year, initially in Asia, now show signs of having a\r\nglobal impact. They will affect developed and developing\r\ncountries alike across most regions of the world. The\r\nproblems that face us demand a calm and steady response\r\nif financial troubles are not to spill over into wider\r\ninstability. This presents a direct challenge to us all, and\r\na test of the component parts of the multilateral system.\r\nThis year we mark 50-year milestones in two major\r\nareas of United Nations work, two areas that distinguish\r\nthis half-century from earlier times: international\r\npeacekeeping and the development of international human\r\nrights law. Both have a part to play in responding to the\r\nchallenges of the present day. Both typify the unique\r\ncontribution of the United Nations system. It is in this\r\nglobal setting that universal international norms can be\r\nestablished. The international rule of law gives us a\r\nframework with which to deal confidently with the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nproblems that confront us. And it is through collective\r\nsecurity that the countries of the world can work together\r\nto promote and reinforce peace and stability.\r\nNew Zealand, as a small country, has from the outset\r\nvalued the opportunities for global debate and collective\r\naction provided by the United Nations. We are committed\r\nto the strengthening of that system. We believe its effective\r\noperation is essential to the well-being of our world.\r\nWe are, of course, as many are, conscious of the\r\ncriticisms that have been levelled at the United Nations in\r\nrecent years. Ten years ago the United Nations stock was\r\nvery high. The end of the cold war was seen as heralding\r\na new age. In 1988 the United Nations peacekeeping forces\r\nwere awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At the turn of the\r\ndecade there was talk of a new world order.\r\nBut the world community’s expectations of what could\r\nbe achieved sometimes exceeded Member States’ own\r\npolitical will to deliver. And the United Nations machinery,\r\nwhich had grown and expanded to meet world expectations,\r\nproved too cumbersome — and often very costly — to\r\nrespond effectively.\r\nEuphoria about the United Nations began to give way\r\nto cynicism. One editorial writer this year referred to the\r\nUnited Nations as “a busted flush”. But when we take a\r\nlonger view it is clear that neither euphoria nor cynicism is\r\nthe appropriate reaction.\r\nSince the end of the cold war the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping machinery has been used as never before.\r\nThere have been some marked successes and, regrettably,\r\nsome failures. Much has been learned. Future peacekeeping\r\nmandates must reflect the lessons learned.\r\nThe need for the United Nations to be able to carry\r\nout its peacekeeping role remains. Its successes point to\r\nwhat it can achieve. But today fewer troops are wearing the\r\nblue beret, and troop-contributing countries do not receive\r\ntimely reimbursement.\r\nThe largest contributor’s arrears in peacekeeping and\r\nthe regular budget cast a long shadow over the\r\nOrganization. Dues outstanding at present have reached\r\nalarming proportions. This affects all — large nations and\r\nsmall nations.\r\nWe cannot afford to have the capacity of the United\r\nNations restricted by this constant budget uncertainty.\r\nIn my own area of the South Pacific we developed\r\na regional response to a regional problem. I am referring\r\nto the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, an\r\nisland which was ravaged by civil war for nine years but\r\nhas enjoyed peace for the last 12 months. It was the\r\nGovernments of the region that set out to help the\r\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea and representatives of\r\nthe Bougainville people to bring this horror to an end.\r\nThe contributions of Australia, Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon\r\nIslands and my own country have played a valuable and\r\nsignificant role, and there is now growing hope and\r\nconfidence on Bougainville — rare commodities for\r\nalmost a decade. The Lincoln Agreement, signed in\r\nChristchurch, New Zealand, in January, while formalizing\r\nthe ceasefire, paved the way also for United Nations\r\nparticipation. We welcomed the United Nations decision\r\nto set up a small political office on the island. This\r\ncommitment by the United Nations will help strengthen\r\nthe peace process there.\r\nToday the world faces uncertainty caused by the\r\nfinancial turmoil which began in Asia. It is affecting the\r\nRussian Federation, is putting many countries in Latin\r\nAmerica under pressure and is now touching just about\r\neverybody. The sudden plunge in investor confidence and\r\nthe reversal of developing markets’ short capital flows has\r\ndramatically changed economic and social prospects.\r\nWorld economic growth this year will be significantly\r\nreduced.\r\nThis most serious economic situation in many years\r\nhas the potential to intrude upon all of our lives. We must\r\ncooperate to turn this crisis around. And at the national\r\nlevel we must take the actions required, not just for our\r\nown sakes but in the interests of the broader international\r\ncommunity. This includes refraining from protectionist\r\nreactions, which could only exacerbate it, and pushing\r\nahead with liberalization of markets wherever possible.\r\nA serious challenge is to ensure that economic\r\ninsecurity does not threaten political and social stability.\r\nWe must resist pressures to take political actions that we\r\nwould normally avoid. The best way to achieve this is\r\nthrough a collective approach to the problems that\r\nconfront us; to strengthen our multilateral institutions in\r\nthe United Nations system and elsewhere and build\r\nconfidence in our joint ability to work through difficult\r\ntimes.\r\nI was particularly struck by the comments of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on these matters in\r\nhis statement on Monday. His characterization of the\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\ncrisis — that it is not just financial or economic or social\r\nor political, but all of these things at once — is exactly\r\nright. I thoroughly endorse the Secretary-General’s\r\nconclusion that we must address the crisis on all these\r\nfronts.\r\nAs a forum for debate, and as a body capable of\r\ntaking global action, the United Nations, together with its\r\nspecialized agencies, has an important role to play in\r\nbuilding capacity and providing social support where it is\r\nneeded. Much of what the United Nations has achieved\r\nprovides the norms and mechanisms to help us through\r\ndifficult times of the sort we are facing right now. The\r\nchallenge for the Organization is to act decisively to tackle\r\nthe problems that have the potential to undermine our\r\nsecurity, problems that have their greatest impact on\r\nordinary people in developing countries. Now is not the\r\ntime to go backwards.\r\nRecent tragic events in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam\r\nhave underlined that the fight against terrorism is far from\r\nover. The response to terrorism must be decisive and\r\nunequivocal. The international community has a duty to\r\nensure that there are no safe havens for terrorist groups.\r\nUniversal commitment to the network of anti-terrorist\r\ninstruments must be a fundamental objective of all\r\nMembers of this Organization.\r\nWar crimes and crimes against humanity have seen a\r\nresurgence in this last part of the twentieth century. New\r\nZealand supports the work of the ad hoc war crimes\r\nTribunals in bringing criminals to justice. But this is not\r\nenough. New Zealand has long called for an international\r\ncriminal court that would have jurisdiction over such\r\ncrimes. We commend the effort of those who, through\r\nmuch hard work, dedication and compromise, enabled the\r\nStatute for the International Criminal Court to be adopted.\r\nIt is our expectation that, with the support of the\r\ninternational community, the Court will prove an effective\r\ntool in the fight against those who carry out appalling\r\natrocities.\r\nNowhere is the need for multilateral action more\r\nclearly obvious than in our efforts to halt environmental\r\ndegradation and promote sustainable development.\r\nNew Zealand is honoured to have our own\r\nEnvironment Minister, the Honourable Simon Upton, chair\r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development for its seventh\r\nsession. It is our strong hope that this session will see us\r\nadvance Agenda 21, and take further steps towards\r\nachieving the goals set at the Rio Earth Summit six years\r\nago. It is appropriate that in the United Nations Year of\r\nthe Ocean the session’s themes will include oceans and\r\nseas and the review of the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States in preparation for next year’s special\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change adopted last\r\nDecember was a positive first step in dealing with this\r\nquintessentially global problem. There remain some\r\nimportant implementation issues to be resolved. The\r\nFourth Congress of the parties in Buenos Aires will\r\nprovide an opportunity to make further progress.\r\nThanks to the commitment of the Secretary-General,\r\nwe now have an Organization that is efficient and\r\neffective. There is more to be done if this great\r\nOrganization is to meet the challenges of the present day:\r\nchanges that make it possible to redirect efforts from the\r\nadministration of the Organization to its front-line work\r\nin development and confronting global problems.\r\nNew Zealand looks forward to continuing the\r\ndialogue on financing for development. Through our\r\ncurrent membership of the Economic and Social Council\r\nwe have followed closely the evolving debate on this very\r\nimportant issue. We very much welcome the initiatives\r\ntaken by the Organization towards closer linkages with\r\nthe Bretton Woods Institutions. Those institutions are\r\nthemselves at the forefront of the effort to tackle the\r\npresent economic crisis, probably the greatest challenge\r\nthey have ever had. However, we must decide whether in\r\ntheir present form they are appropriate for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThis Organization, too, like any other, needs to\r\nrespond to changing circumstances, and be flexible\r\nenough to meet new challenges. It must reflect the world\r\nof today, not stay fixed in the patterns of earlier times.\r\nThe East-West conflict is well behind us. We now need\r\nto address anew the divide between North and South. The\r\nUnited Nations development role is crucial. Once again I\r\nbelieve the Secretary-General hit the nail on the head\r\nwhen he described in his statement on Monday the need\r\nto restore development to its proper place in global\r\neconomic strategy. Also essential are measures to free up\r\ntrade and investment flows, and promote access to\r\ninformation and technology. All of these are tools with\r\nwhich to fight the economic downturn which is\r\nconfronting us.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nThe United Nations clearly has the leading role to play\r\nin development. Other international institutions play a\r\ncomplementary part. I am personally conscious of the\r\nparticular contribution made by the Commonwealth through\r\nthe recent Commonwealth Small States Mission. That\r\nMission highlighted the special vulnerability of small\r\nStates, which has led to the establishment of the\r\nCommonwealth/World Bank task force on the issue which\r\nwill have relevance to the work of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) on the question of vulnerability.\r\nWithin the United Nations we need to correct the\r\nNorth-South imbalance to which I referred through reform\r\nof the Security Council. More equitable representation on\r\nthe Council would better reflect the world as it is and\r\ntoday’s United Nations. Expansion is proving a complex\r\nissue, but there has been some good progress this year in\r\nthe equally important area of reforming the Council’s\r\nworking methods. Altogether, these are matters which\r\nrequire careful consideration and negotiation. Setting\r\nartificial deadlines ahead of general agreement on a reform\r\npackage would not be helpful and could in fact prove\r\ndamaging to the Organization. Any reforms must enjoy the\r\nsupport of the greatest possible number of Member States.\r\nI should add that regional groups in the United\r\nNations still reflect an earlier era. New Zealand is certainly\r\nopen to new ideas on how groupings can be reorganized to\r\ncreate a more equitable distribution of electoral\r\nopportunities and to recognize modern-day political and\r\neconomic linkages.\r\nIn the field of disarmament and arms control, it is\r\ntimely to consider how far we have come and what we\r\nhave achieved. The adoption of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 certainly promised the end\r\nof nuclear testing. But the global non-proliferation norm\r\nwas shattered by the nuclear testing in South Asia, raising\r\ngrave fears of a potential arms race. New Zealand has taken\r\nsome encouragement from statements made in this Hall in\r\nrecent days, and hopes that 1999 will be the year in which\r\nall countries that have not yet done so will sign up\r\nunconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty.\r\nThe Conference on Disarmament has now agreed to\r\nproceed with negotiations on a fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty. New Zealand wants to see those negotiations\r\nconcluded as soon as possible. There must be no stepping\r\nback from the objective of complete disarmament, including\r\nthe elimination of nuclear weapons. New Zealand’s\r\ncommitment to this objective was reiterated in the\r\ndeclaration which I, together with the Foreign Ministers\r\nof seven other countries, issued on 9 June. New Zealand\r\nis now working with those countries on a draft resolution\r\nbased on the concerns outlined in the declaration.\r\nOne achievement which I personally see as a top\r\npriority for 1999 is the conclusion of a verification\r\nprotocol to the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nDevelopment, Production and Stockpiling of\r\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\r\nTheir Destruction. Following a very successful initiative\r\nfrom Australia, I was pleased to chair a group of\r\nministers who this week issued a statement urging\r\nGovernments to commit themselves to completing this\r\ntask.\r\nNew Zealand supports the actions of the United\r\nNations to ensure the elimination of Iraq’s stockpiles of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and the threat they pose to\r\nthe security of the region. We urge the Government of\r\nIraq to resume cooperation with the United Nations\r\nSpecial Commission so that the elimination of these\r\ndreadful weapons can be confirmed. Then the Security\r\nCouncil can once more address the question of lifting\r\nsanctions.\r\nIn the 50 years since Member States adopted the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the significance\r\nof the Declaration has been demonstrated time and time\r\nagain. Yet there remains much to be done before the\r\nvision in the Charter and in the Declaration can be\r\nrealized for all. We are confident that, under the\r\nleadership of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,\r\nwe will continue to make good progress towards the\r\nrealization of that vision.\r\nThe United Nations can add value in promoting and\r\nprotecting fundamental human rights standards,\r\nemphasizing practical capacity-building efforts. We have\r\nbeen supporting the High Commissioner’s efforts in this\r\narea, and we will continue to do so.\r\nWe see countries in all regions of the world seeking\r\nthe international community’s support as they build\r\nstructures to provide good governance and deliver hope\r\nand greater well-being to their people. In particular, I am\r\nencouraged by developments in Nigeria and in Sierra\r\nLeone in this regard.\r\nAs the last 50 years have demonstrated, this\r\nOrganization has added a whole new dimension to\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\ncooperation among nations. No lesser body could have\r\nachieved so much. In the longer perspective of history it\r\nwill be the dramatic development of the international rule\r\nof law and the evolution of collective approaches to\r\nsecurity, both political and economic, which will\r\ncharacterize our era. In other words, that really is the work\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nNow, with the challenge of the economic problems\r\nthat face us, we nations of the world are more dependent\r\nthan ever on solving our shared problems together. New\r\nZealand therefore rededicates itself to the United Nations\r\nand to the ideals that this Organization stands for.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister of Foreign Affairs and\r\nTrade of the Republic of Korea, His Excellency Mr. Hong\r\nSoon-young.\r\nMr. Hong (Republic of Korea): On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Korea, I sincerely\r\ncongratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the\r\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nfully confident that the Assembly will reap fruitful results\r\nunder his distinguished leadership. I would also like to pay\r\ntribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y.\r\nUdovenko, and to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan.\r\nI would like to discuss today our common future and\r\nthe various efforts that we will need to consider to ensure\r\nits betterment. With the new millennium just around the\r\ncorner, we must contemplate the possibilities for our future\r\nworld. With confidence and pride, we can look back over\r\nthe past five decades and note with appreciation the\r\ntremendous contributions the United Nations has made\r\ntowards international peace and prosperity. We must also\r\nnote that today the United Nations is confronted with\r\nenormous challenges and opportunities. The identification\r\nof these challenges, both within the United Nations itself\r\nand in the world with which the United Nations must\r\nengage, is where our discussion must begin.\r\nAs a world community, we face trends and challenges\r\nthat test our wisdom and courage. Before I discuss our\r\ncommon efforts, I would like to begin by addressing how\r\nwe are now handling our own concerns in Korea. Last\r\nFebruary, the Republic of Korea inaugurated the\r\nGovernment of President Kim Dae-jung. This Government\r\ncarries special significance for the Korean people because\r\nit marks the first time an opposition party has acceded to\r\npower in the 50-year constitutional history of Korea.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is one of the countries that\r\ngained independence during the last half-century; it has\r\nsubsequently developed into a liberal democracy within a\r\nrelatively short period of time. Poverty-stricken and war-\r\ntorn only 50 years ago, the Republic of Korea has now\r\ngrown to be a middle-power State.\r\nMy country is currently endeavouring to overcome\r\nenormous economic difficulties and to ensure the parallel\r\nand harmonious development of democracy and free\r\nmarket economy. We are well aware that the world is\r\nwatching to see if and how we can accomplish such a\r\ndifficult task. On 15 August 1998, on the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Government of the Republic of Korea,\r\nPresident Kim Dae Jung proclaimed the launching of our\r\n“Second Nation Building” to define the nation’s efforts to\r\novercome the current crisis and to foster Korea’s\r\ndemocracy and market economy to greater maturity.\r\nOur immediate concerns, however, are not only\r\neconomic. The new Government of the Republic of Korea\r\nformulated the “Sunshine Policy”, a policy of constructive\r\nengagement, as the cornerstone of its stance towards\r\nNorth Korea. Division, war and confrontation have more\r\noften than not characterized inter-Korean relations.\r\nChanging the nature of this relationship requires the\r\nrestoration and cultivation of mutual trust between the\r\ntwo parties. To achieve these goals, President Kim\r\nannounced the following three principles immediately\r\nafter his inauguration: no tolerance of any military\r\nprovocation by North Korea; no attempts on our part to\r\nabsorb the North; and the active promotion of inter-\r\nKorean reconciliation, exchange and cooperation.\r\nIn line with these principles, my Government is\r\nencouraging private sector initiatives to pursue exchanges\r\nand cooperation with the North at their own discretion,\r\nwhile maintaining the principle of reciprocity at the\r\ngovernmental level. The Republic of Korea will remain\r\ncommitted to actively responding to the appeals of the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations to\r\nassist North Korea to overcome its food shortages and\r\neconomic difficulties. We believe that inter-Korean\r\nconsultations are indispensable for North Korea’s\r\neconomic recovery. In this regard, we also look forward\r\nto the role of the United Nations system as a facilitator of\r\nthis process.\r\nIn his August speech, President Kim Dae Jung\r\nfurther proposed the establishment of a permanent inter-\r\nKorean dialogue arrangement headed by ministerial or\r\nvice-ministerial officials, in the hope of opening a new\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nera of reconciliation and cooperation between the two\r\nKoreas. He also made it clear that the Republic of Korea is\r\nwilling to send an envoy to Pyongyang to discuss this\r\nproposal. The main thrust of President Kim’s engagement\r\npolicy is to establish a workable system of peaceful\r\ncoexistence based on reconciliation and mutual trust.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea reacted\r\npassively or even negatively to these proposals. It provoked\r\nthe Republic of Korea by infiltrating a submarine into\r\nSouth Korean territorial waters in June, and again in late\r\nAugust by launching a rocket into the western Pacific\r\nOcean without any prior warning. My Government deplores\r\nthese acts of provocation. They pose a serious threat to our\r\nsecurity. But despite these acts of provocation, my\r\nGovernment continues to uphold the keynote of its\r\nengagement policy so that the two Koreas might come to\r\nenjoy the benefits of peaceful coexistence.\r\nMy Government hopes that the leadership of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will put aside its\r\ndefiance and respond positively to our calls for dialogue\r\nand collaboration. We would like to revitalize and\r\nimplement the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement of 1992\r\nthrough South-North dialogue. My Government will try to\r\nease tension and create a peaceful environment on the\r\nKorean Peninsula through the four-party talks process. I\r\nwish to reiterate that our immediate objective is, first and\r\nforemost, peaceful coexistence. We hope that the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will respond with\r\nan equal display of sincerity and good faith to our policies\r\nof accommodation.\r\nI would now like to share some thoughts with you on\r\nthe current global economic situation. In the past decade,\r\nwe have witnessed deepening interdependence among\r\ncountries in the accelerated, market-driven process of\r\nglobalization. However, contrary to earlier expectations that\r\nthe globalization process would stimulate world economic\r\ngrowth and reduce the gap between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, the international community is now\r\nbaffled by the negative repercussions of rapid globalization.\r\nAsian countries, which have long been a model of\r\neconomic development, are now struggling with serious\r\nfinancial crises. Other countries are also suffering economic\r\nunrest, and together these may lead to global economic\r\nturmoil.\r\nThe international community, amid sudden and\r\nunexpected economic turbulences, would be well advised to\r\ndevelop a common strategy to maximize potential economic\r\nbenefits of market liberalization and globalization. Towards\r\nthis end, my Government welcomes the United Nations\r\ninitiative to strengthen its dialogue and cooperation with\r\nthe Bretton Woods system. The United Nations is\r\nexpected to play a more active role in addressing diverse\r\nproblems arising from the globalization process.\r\nAmong the various factors that triggered our own\r\ndomestic economic difficulties was a loose application of\r\nthe rule of accountability in the corporate and financial\r\nsector. My Government is trying to turn the current\r\nfinancial crisis into an opportunity to reform and\r\nrevitalize its economy. We are taking bold and decisive\r\nsteps towards a comprehensive structural reform based on\r\ndemocracy and market principles. This structural reform\r\nis intended to ensure deregulation of economic activities,\r\ntransparency and accountability in the financial and\r\ncorporate sector, and mobility in the labour market. When\r\nthe ongoing structural reform is successfully completed,\r\nthe Republic of Korea will be a more free and more open\r\nsociety, contributing to the resurgence of economic\r\ndynamism in the Asian region. This is the goal of our\r\nstructural reform.\r\nIn spite of overall growth in the world economy, the\r\nleast developed countries continue to be marginalized and\r\nstill do not receive their fair share of the benefits of that\r\ngeneral trend. As a community, we should pay more\r\nattention to the deteriorating situation in these\r\nmarginalized countries and should strengthen economic\r\nand development cooperation for their sustainable growth.\r\nFor this purpose, my Government supports the\r\ndevelopment of the least developed countries through the\r\nKorea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and\r\ncooperates with United Nations regional economic\r\ncommissions, such as the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the\r\nEconomic Commission for Africa (ECA). Even with the\r\ncurrent financial crisis, the Republic of Korea continues\r\nto play its due role in development cooperation, with\r\nKOICA as its focal point.\r\nWhile contributing to the strengthening of\r\nmultilateral cooperation, we are also participating in\r\nregional cooperation efforts aimed at stimulating and\r\nsustaining steady regional growth and balanced\r\ndevelopment for the Asia-Pacific region. We are\r\ncontributing to regional liberalization of trade and\r\ninvestment through active involvement in the Asia-Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC). In addition, my\r\nGovernment is scheduled to host the third summit of the\r\nAsia-Europe Meeting in the year 2000. We will do our\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nbest to make the summit a milestone in building a\r\ncomprehensive partnership between Asia and Europe.\r\nBeyond these immediate concerns for economic\r\nrevitalization in Korea and the world community in general,\r\nwe are faced with another long-term challenge, that of\r\nenvironmental protection. Climate changes, for instance,\r\ndemand urgent attention and concrete actions by all\r\ncountries. Last year, we made historic progress in\r\ncombating global warming by adopting the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nI am pleased to say that my Government will accede to the\r\nKyoto Protocol this afternoon.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to say a few\r\nwords about the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). My\r\nGovernment has hosted IVI as a part of its commitment to\r\ninternational efforts to prevent childhood diseases,\r\nespecially those in developing countries. Thirty-two\r\nGovernments and the World Health Organization (WHO)\r\nhave signed the Establishment Agreement of IVI, aimed at\r\ndeveloping and distributing non-commercial vaccines.\r\nYesterday in New York, the Government of the Republic\r\nof Korea and IVI signed the Headquarters Agreement. I\r\nlook forward to more active support and to the substantial\r\nparticipation of Member States in this worthy project.\r\nFifty years after the adoption of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and despite strenuous efforts\r\nby the United Nations and human rights defenders, we are\r\nstill witnessing, to our dismay, serious human rights\r\nviolations and blatant challenges to United Nations human\r\nrights mechanisms throughout the world. Notwithstanding\r\nthese grim realities, I am convinced that history is moving\r\ntowards universal respect for human rights and dignity. In\r\nthis context, my Government fully supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative to mainstream human rights in all of the\r\nUnited Nations activities and programmes. As an initiative\r\nto bolster national human rights safeguard mechanisms, my\r\nGovernment has begun preparations for enacting a\r\ncomprehensive human rights act and establishing a national\r\nhuman rights institution.\r\nMy Government welcomes the adoption of the Statute\r\nof the International Criminal Court in Rome last July. We\r\nare confident that the establishment of the Court will be a\r\nlandmark in strengthening the international legal system.\r\nWe earnestly hope that the Court will be launched as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nIn the rapidly changing international security\r\nenvironment of the post-cold-war era, the United Nations is\r\nnow faced with new challenges arising from the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their\r\nmeans of delivery. We deeply regret the recent nuclear\r\ntests carried out by India and then Pakistan. These tests\r\nseriously undermine the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nWe call upon the States concerned to desist from further\r\nnuclear testing and weaponization, and to accede to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) without delay. We also urge the international\r\ncommunity to maintain vigilance to prevent the transfer\r\nof their nuclear weapons-related materials, equipment and\r\ntechnology to third countries.\r\nIn this context, we believe that the early entry into\r\nforce and the securing of the universality of the CTBT\r\nshould be a high priority of the disarmament agenda. My\r\nGovernment is proceeding with its domestic procedures\r\nfor the ratification of the CTBT next year. At the same\r\ntime, we welcome the decision made at the Conference\r\non Disarmament in Geneva last month to establish an ad\r\nhoc committee on the Fissile Material Cut-off\r\nConvention. We also call upon all nuclear-weapon States\r\nfaithfully to comply with their obligations to undertake\r\nnuclear disarmament pursuant to article VI of the NPT.\r\nWe stress once again that the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, as a State party to the NPT, should\r\nfully comply with the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) safeguards agreement. It should also\r\ncarry out its obligations to freeze its nuclear activities and\r\neventually dismantle the related facilities in accordance\r\nwith the Geneva Agreed Framework. In particular, it\r\nshould cooperate closely with the IAEA in preserving\r\nnecessary information related to its past nuclear activities.\r\nFurthermore, we urge the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea to demonstrate its sincerity in upholding the\r\nAgreed Framework by guaranteeing full transparency with\r\nregard to the recently discovered underground facilities\r\nnear Yongbyon.\r\nFor its part, my Government will make continued\r\nefforts, together with the United States, Japan and other\r\nparties concerned, for smooth progress in the Korean\r\nPeninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO)\r\nproject, pursuant to the Agreed Framework. As the KEDO\r\nproject contributes to the peace and security of the region,\r\nwe look forward to continued political and financial\r\nsupport from the international community. We also\r\nbelieve that both Koreas should renew their efforts to\r\nimplement the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization\r\nof the Korean Peninsula of 1992.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nMy Government shares the grave concern of the\r\ninternational community over the launching of the rocket-\r\npropelled object by the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea on 31 August. The Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea’s ability to develop delivery means of weapons of\r\nmass destruction poses a serious threat to peace and\r\nsecurity on the Korean Peninsula and in North-East Asia.\r\nThe international community should make concerted efforts\r\nto induce the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to\r\nrefrain from conducting further missile development, testing\r\nand exporting.\r\nChemical and biological weapons are another category\r\nof weapons of mass destruction that requires our serious\r\nattention. We commend the valuable achievements of the\r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons over\r\nthe last year and a half. Regrettably, a number of countries\r\npresumed to possess chemical weapons, including the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, have not yet\r\nacceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. We urge\r\nthose States to do so without delay. My delegation also\r\nhopes for an early adoption of the Verification Protocol to\r\nthe Biological Weapons Convention.\r\nIn recent years, we have seen the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations expand their activities to such\r\nareas as repatriation of refugees, demilitarization and\r\ndisbanding of armies, and the policing and monitoring of\r\nelections. While this trend can be viewed positively, my\r\ndelegation is deeply concerned about the increasing number\r\nof victims among civilian volunteers and United Nations\r\npersonnel. The Republic of Korea, while serving as a\r\nmember of the Security Council last year, initiated a\r\nCouncil open debate on protection for humanitarian\r\nassistance to refugees in conflict situations, which led to the\r\nadoption of a presidential statement. We hope that the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on this topic, released this week,\r\nwill renew the international community’s awareness of this\r\nissue and lead to concrete follow-up measures.\r\nMy delegation is deeply disturbed by the recent\r\nincrease in brutal international terrorist activities. The\r\nRepublic of Korea will not tolerate any acts of terrorism,\r\nand urges all Member States to cooperate in devising\r\neffective international measures to combat terrorism.\r\nOn the threshold of the new millennium, the\r\ninternational community is encountering an increasingly\r\ncomplex set of challenges to peace and security. At this\r\ncritical juncture, the Security Council needs to reform itself\r\nto adapt to the drastically changed international\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe Republic of Korea fully supports an expanded,\r\nmore representative and democratic Security Council.\r\nHowever, no Security Council reform package will be\r\nfeasible without universal support among Member States.\r\nIn this regard, we hope that the Council reform package\r\nwill be worked out on the broadest consensus possible,\r\nfar exceeding the mandatory endorsement by two thirds\r\nof the members of the General Assembly. In this context,\r\nwe note with appreciation the efforts of the Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform to seek a realistic and\r\npractical solution which should enjoy general agreement\r\namong Member States.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the reform efforts that\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has made since taking\r\noffice. The Republic of Korea has consistently supported\r\nthe Secretary-General’s reform initiatives and will\r\ncontinue to do so in our common efforts to revitalize the\r\nOrganization in the years ahead. We hope that the\r\nMillennium Assembly, to be held in the year 2000, will\r\nserve as an opportunity to crystallize the visions and\r\nstrategies needed to meet the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nWe look forward to the twenty-first century with\r\ngreat expectations. The time ahead of us will undoubtedly\r\npose daunting challenges. Of this, I am certain. But it also\r\npromises a bright future if we, together, can successfully\r\nrise to the occasion. The United Nations is a tool and a\r\nforum; it is a symbol — the best that we have — of our\r\njoint commitment to making the next century more\r\nsecure, more humane and more hopeful than the last one.\r\nThe Republic of Korea, together with other Member\r\nStates, stands ready to make its due contributions towards\r\nthese lofty goals.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Arab\r\nRepublic of Egypt, His Excellency Mr. Amre Moussa.\r\nMr. Moussa (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me at the outset to convey my sincere\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Opertti upon his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at this session and to\r\nexpress my full confidence that he will lead its work\r\nwisely and ably.\r\nIt gives me pleasure as well to pay tribute to the\r\nwise leadership of the former Foreign Minister of\r\nUkraine, President of the Assembly at its last session,\r\nparticularly in promoting the efforts for reform and\r\nrenewal in the United Nations.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nI would like also to salute the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who displayed his wisdom and expertise\r\nin dealing with world crises and for his outstanding\r\ncontribution to increasing the efficiency of the Organization\r\nin order for it to keep pace with the changing times,\r\ncontribute to the building of the new international order and\r\navoid the pitfalls.\r\nThis is the next-to-last session of the General\r\nAssembly in this century. Let it be a session for reflection\r\nand preparation for the last session of the twentieth century,\r\nnext year. Let us take stock of the international work of a\r\nwhole century, its positive and negative aspects alike. Let\r\nus evaluate the achievements and innovations of mankind,\r\nwhere it failed and why. Let us list and analyse the work\r\ndone and the progress made by the United Nations to create\r\nconstructive international cooperation and establish peace.\r\nLet us also talk about what remains on the international\r\nagenda and what will be left for succeeding generations to\r\nfinish and accomplish.\r\nIn the Charter of the United Nations, we determined\r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\r\nHave we done so? Where did we succeed, where did we\r\nfail, and why? We also reaffirmed our faith in fundamental\r\nhuman rights and in the dignity of nations and human\r\nbeings. How far have we gone in translating this solemn\r\nreaffirmation into a reality? We committed ourselves to\r\npromoting social progress and better standards of life, and\r\nto using the United Nations for the promotion of the social\r\nand economic advancement of all peoples. Have we\r\nhonoured that commitment? We determined to practise\r\ntolerance and live together in peace and neighbourliness.\r\nHave we achieved that? We determined to unite our\r\nstrength to maintain international peace and security and not\r\nto use armed force except for common interest. Has this\r\ndetermination come true? Have we achieved what we\r\ndetermined to do?\r\nImmediately after the end of the cold war in the late\r\n1980s, some spoke of “the clash of civilizations”. This is a\r\ndangerous theory that concerns humanity and the course it\r\nwill chart for itself — whether conflict and conflagration or\r\ncoexistence and peace. We, the representatives of the\r\ninternational community, cannot, at this historical juncture,\r\nignore such a dangerous argument and a destructive theory\r\nthat runs counter to the common work and collective\r\nobligations we agreed upon for international life. We, the\r\nchildren of the twentieth century, must deal with this theory\r\nand respond to it clearly. We cannot let such a negative call\r\ngo without a response or correction. What President Clinton\r\nsaid in his address before the Assembly, rejecting this\r\ntheory and expressing respect for Islamic civilization, is\r\nreally worthy of consideration and appreciation.\r\nIn our opinion, we must offer the next century our\r\nconfident view that we are one community based on\r\npluralism — intellectual, religious and cultural pluralism\r\nand diversity. We must reaffirm that this diversity does\r\nnot prejudice the unity of the international community.\r\nRather, it strengthens that unity, making the international\r\ncommunity a dynamic whole based on healthy\r\ncompetition, positive coexistence and a common\r\nappreciation for the achievements of the many societies\r\nthat constitute the international community. Our\r\ncommunity cannot be dependent on the achievements of\r\none single society or tend to follow one single culture.\r\nThe true path lies in positive interaction, complementarity\r\nand coexistence among civilizations. It does not lie in the\r\ncreation of causes for conflict or in fanning the flames of\r\nconfrontation and of clash between civilizations. If this is\r\nallowed to happen, it will create a dangerous hotbed of\r\nworld tension and will ultimately result in a grave loss for\r\none and all.\r\nOnce again we are at a historic juncture where a\r\nstrong message from this generation is indeed necessary.\r\nWe want to see the rights of people and nations upheld\r\nwithout differences as to priorities and definitions. We\r\nwant rational disarmament and an end to the arms race\r\nwithout distinction or discrimination. We want genuine\r\ndevelopment that does not entrench poverty or ignore its\r\ncauses. We want a clean environment, a science that\r\nbenefits all and a technology whose achievements and\r\napplications are beneficial to all. We want a common\r\nposition in the face of international terrorism. We want\r\nfreedom and liberation for all peoples and a firm stand in\r\nthe face of the forces of oppression, racism and\r\noccupation. We want a commitment to the rule of law\r\nand respect for established norms and for the purposes\r\nand principles we consensually consecrated in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn order to evaluate the experiences of the past and\r\nto chart our future course, I propose that this session\r\ncreate a committee to commence drafting a clear\r\nstatement to history to be issued at the close of the next\r\nsession. This statement should include our assessment of\r\nthe past and our vision of the future. It should be issued\r\na few days before the end of the century and the\r\nbeginning of the new millennium.\r\nThe world today is passing through a stage of chaos,\r\nand there is a general feeling of discontent. Wars,\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nterrorism, backwardness, racism, religious intolerance: are\r\nthese the remnants of past eras? Or are they the result of\r\npractices that continue to plague our societies? Or are they\r\nan integral part of the fabric of human life? Or are they the\r\nresult of globalization and the factors of tension and\r\ninstability contained in the new world order?\r\nI believe we all sense the instability in international\r\nlife. We have witnessed and continue to witness widespread\r\nacts of terrorism throughout all continents of the world. We\r\nhave witnessed widespread extremism in various faiths and\r\nwidespread injustice in various societies. All this points to\r\nthe fact that richness and poverty, despite their undisputed\r\nimportance as two of the facts of life, do not constitute the\r\nonly causes of world instability. There are other causes,\r\nforemost among which is the policy of double standards,\r\nthe lack of democracy in international relations, the brazen\r\ncall for a clash of civilizations and the varying\r\ninterpretations of the principles of legality. All these\r\nelements lead to the feeling of discontent, indeed, to the\r\ngeneral feeling of insecurity.\r\nI believe it is incumbent upon us to consider this\r\nmatter. These questions call for a clear answer because the\r\nchallenge is enormous, and the results could therefore be\r\ngrave. We are all in the same boat. This responsibility is\r\nnot the responsibility of any one society. If globalization\r\nand universality are much talked about, this should mean\r\nthat they call for a sharing of responsibility.\r\nI would like to deal briefly with some of the central\r\nissues that occupy our minds at this stage.\r\nI shall start with terrorism. Some note, and rightly so,\r\nthat this international crime against all societies is\r\nperpetrated using tight organizations, facilitated sometimes\r\nby circumstances in which some have misguidedly\r\nsupported certain groups by encouraging and dealing with\r\nthem until those groups turned against them. This is a\r\nlesson we must learn in order to avoid its repetition.\r\nFurthermore, some have noted, and rightly so, that the hand\r\nof terrorism has struck more than one place at the same\r\ntime: Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam and Omagh in Ireland. Before\r\nthen, that hand of terrorism struck many places in the\r\nworld, for different motives, certainly. But the phenomenon\r\nis one and the same, and it is intolerable. We must reflect\r\nupon this matter together.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to underline the importance\r\nof the legislation enacted by the British House of Commons\r\non dealing with the acts of conspiracy committed on British\r\nterritory, of the proposal of President Jacques Chirac of\r\nFrance on controlling the financing of terrorist groups,\r\nand of what was said by President Clinton in his\r\nstatement before the Assembly in this regard. I find it\r\nimportant also in this connection to put before the\r\nAssembly the call of President Hosni Mubarak to convene\r\nan international summit under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. The summit should direct the international\r\ncommunity to deal with terrorism legally, politically,\r\neconomically and technologically. This call was supported\r\nin the final communiqué of the recent summit of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement. I suggest that the General Assembly\r\nconsider the Egyptian call for the proposed summit. I also\r\ncall upon the Secretary-General to start working towards\r\nits convening.\r\nTurning to disarmament, allow me to say that recent\r\ndevelopments have proved the shortcomings of the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime in its current form,\r\nwhich lacks universality. This reaffirms the need for\r\nurgent and serious steps to remedy that shortcoming, and\r\nto strengthen the efficiency of the regime through\r\nachieving its universality and avoiding the policy of\r\ndouble standards; otherwise, we will end up with a state\r\nof deep mistrust and an arms race that would in turn lead\r\nto the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nespecially nuclear weapons.\r\nFor the last three decades, Egypt has consistently\r\ncalled for making the Middle East free from nuclear\r\nweapons. This call was further reinforced by its 1990\r\ninitiative to make the region free from weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Today, we reiterate this call with a view to\r\nmaintaining peace and security in the region.\r\nStarting from this same premise, Egypt, together\r\nwith seven other States, recently proposed a new agenda\r\nto strengthen the international commitment towards a\r\nworld free of weapons of mass destruction, an initiative\r\nwe invite the Assembly to support. In this connection,\r\nallow me to place on record the call of President Hosni\r\nMubarak to convene an international conference to\r\nconsider the elimination of those weapons from the whole\r\nworld within an agreed time-frame. I invite members of\r\nthe Assembly to work together in order to translate that\r\ncall into a reality.\r\nI now move to the question of the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. Here, the premise of the Egyptian policy\r\nis the same as that adopted by the summit of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement in Durban: we call for commitment to\r\nthe principles of the Charter and international law as a\r\ncommon position on the agenda for reform.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nHere, I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his ideas and initiatives in this regard. I would\r\nalso like to reaffirm what the summit of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement adopted concerning the importance of taking\r\ninto account the views of the Member States of the United\r\nNations in the implementation of the reform policies and\r\nthe reaffirmation of the pivotal role of the General\r\nAssembly in the decision-making process, as the main\r\ndemocratic framework of the United Nations.\r\nConcerning the Security Council, the position of Egypt\r\nis based on the same elements adopted by the non-aligned\r\nStates as follows: first, the need to deal with the questions\r\nof the reform of the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil and the expansion of its membership within an\r\nintegrated framework; secondly, increasing the membership\r\nof the Security Council by no fewer than 11 members and\r\nthe allocation of a number of permanent seats for\r\ndeveloping countries, with strict observance of the\r\nprinciples of equitable geographical distribution and\r\nequality of States; thirdly, the unacceptability of any\r\nattempt at a partial or selective expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Security Council; fourthly, the\r\ninadmissibility of any predetermined time-frame to\r\ncomplete the process of restructuring the Security Council;\r\nand lastly, the need for any resolution that would result in\r\namending the Charter, the so-called framework resolution,\r\nto be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations, in accordance with Article\r\n108 of the Charter.\r\nIn addition, Egypt is committed to the decision of the\r\nsummit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in\r\nHarare in 1997 on the allocation of five non-permanent\r\nseats and two permanent seats for the African continent, to\r\nbe rotated in accordance with agreed criteria of the Group\r\nof African States.\r\nOn the subject of the reform of the United Nations, I\r\nwould like to refer to a matter that was the subject of\r\nextensive deliberations in the United Nations and in the\r\nrecent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement — namely,\r\nthe sanctions imposed by the Security Council. As the\r\nultimate objective of such sanctions is to influence certain\r\npolitical regimes to bring them into compliance with the\r\nrules of international legality, it is therefore necessary that\r\nall means under Chapter VI of the Charter be exhausted\r\nbefore resorting to Chapter VII and its applications. The\r\nclarity of the objective of imposing sanctions and a\r\nthorough consideration of their consequences in the short\r\nand long terms, including human suffering, are of\r\nparamount importance.\r\nAn excessive imposition of sanctions, or their\r\nperpetuation without acceptable reason or a clear time-\r\nframe, will erode their credibility and the commitments\r\nmade to applying them. Therefore, there is a need for\r\npatience, prudence and a determination of the time-frame\r\nof sanctions.\r\nI now turn to the Middle East, which is suffering\r\nfrom numerous problems, some chronic and others fairly\r\nrecent, which we hope will not also become chronic ones.\r\nI am referring here to the situation of Iraq, which must\r\nreach its natural conclusion: the lifting of the sanctions\r\nthrough implementation of the Security Council’s\r\nresolutions and in accordance with their provisions. This\r\nrequires goodwill, proper conduct and the establishment\r\nof constructive and stable cooperation between Iraq and\r\nthe mechanisms of the Security Council. This is a shared\r\nresponsibility, not the responsibility of one party alone.\r\nNeedless to say, the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction in Iraq is an integral part of their elimination\r\nin the region as a whole, as was indeed reflected in\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991).\r\nI would also like to refer to the Lockerbie issue and\r\nexpress our satisfaction at the recent positive development\r\nof the situation by the consent of the parties to that yet-\r\nto-be settled dispute. This represents significant progress\r\ntowards the trial of the two suspects and establishing the\r\ntruth. We all hope that progress will be made, in good\r\nfaith, as soon as possible within the framework of the\r\ncontacts made by the Secretary-General and that an\r\nagreement will be reached on the required procedures and\r\nguarantees. Thus, the whole matter will be put behind us,\r\nthe sanctions imposed on Libya will be lifted and a long\r\noverdue end to a period of tension will come to pass.\r\nAt another level, we believe that the region must\r\navoid anything that could add to its tensions: declarations\r\nof strategic alliances that create discord and lead to\r\ncounter-alliances; sneaking into the nuclear club, which\r\nwill lead to an arms race in the region, unless Israel, like\r\nall other States of the region, accedes to the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty; the lack of a solution to the problems\r\nand disputes of sovereignty, foremost among which is the\r\nquestion of the three islands of the United Arab Emirates\r\nin the Gulf; and attempts at partitioning and jeopardizing\r\nthe unity and territorial integrity of States, as is the case\r\nwith Iraq and Sudan.\r\nAs for the peace process, which is about to collapse,\r\nthe situation is indeed grave, not only because of the\r\ndeadlock it has reached, but also because the roots of the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nproblem go much deeper than that. The deadlock is related\r\nto the negative change in the policy of Israel, which\r\nbelieves that the current international situation enables it to\r\nimpose its exaggerated demands on the Arab parties and to\r\nimpose an Israeli peace on the Middle East. This is\r\nprobably due to the belief which it has evolved, namely that\r\nno person, no Government and no State would be able to\r\nstand in its way, pressure it or refuse its demands.\r\nWe reject this policy, which uses security\r\nconsiderations to justify occupation, thus stripping security\r\nrequirements, which could be legitimate, of any meaning.\r\nSuch requirements could have been negotiated and\r\nreasonable ones accepted on a reciprocal basis. Yet the\r\nvalidity, true weight and credibility of those Israeli security\r\nrequirements have become dubious. Egypt, the first Arab\r\nState to establish peace with Israel and the largest one with\r\na role in the Middle East and the Arab and Islamic worlds,\r\ncannot accept such negative policies, which will drive the\r\nregion once more towards the flames of tension, conflict\r\nand instability.\r\nWe have made peace with Israel. The Arab States\r\nhave moved towards the same objective on the basis of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967), which is based on\r\nthe principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of\r\nterritory by force and on Israel’s right to live in peace\r\nwithin its borders — which are, of course, the borders and\r\nthe lines of June 1967 — as well as on the basis of the\r\nMadrid framework, namely, the principle of land for peace.\r\nWith respect to the Palestinians, the Oslo accord provides\r\nfor significant Israeli withdrawals before the final status\r\nnegotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides can\r\nbegin.\r\nAt their summit meeting in Cairo in 1996, Arab\r\nleaders at the highest level expressed the commitment of\r\nArab States to the peace process, since Arab-Israeli peace\r\nis a strategic objective to be achieved under international\r\nlegality. But it requires a corresponding commitment from\r\nIsrael to follow the road to peace in a manner that restores\r\nthe rights and the occupied territories of the Palestinians\r\nand ensures balanced and equal security to all the States of\r\nthe region, in accordance with the principle of land for\r\npeace.\r\nThe Arab summit decided that any disruption by Israel\r\nof these principles and bases of the peace process; that any\r\nreneging on the commitments it has made and agreements\r\nreached on the same path; and that any procrastination in\r\ntheir implementation will only set back the peace process.\r\nThe attendant dangers and repercussions of such actions\r\nwould relaunch the region into the spiral of tension and\r\ncompel the Arab States to reconsider the steps they have\r\ntaken towards Israel within the framework of the peace\r\nprocess. The Israeli Government alone would bear the full\r\nresponsibility for such a development.\r\nRegrettably, it has become evident that the Israeli\r\nGovernment is reneging on the commitments it has\r\nundertaken in the context of the Security Council’s\r\nresolutions, the Madrid framework and the Oslo accord.\r\nThis attitude logically compels us to take a forthright and\r\ndetermined opposition to Israel’s negative position, which\r\nruns counter to the objective requirements for peace. If\r\nwe do not, the effective international action necessary to\r\ndeal with this grave situation will not be forthcoming.\r\nWe wonder what the Israeli Government really\r\nwants. The Arabs have given it acceptance, coexistence,\r\npeace and recognition. But it would seem that what the\r\nIsraeli Government really wants is all of the above, plus\r\nmost of the land and the privilege to disregard the rights\r\nof the Palestinians. This is simply unacceptable. Peoples\r\nhave their dignity and the rights to their own land and to\r\nself-determination. No generation is entitled to cede such\r\nrights. They are the rights of all generations — past,\r\npresent and future — throughout history.\r\nWe reiterate that Israel must reconsider its position\r\nand its policy. The international situation is ever\r\nchanging. What may be imposed today without justice or\r\nbalance will disintegrate tomorrow. We want a stable,\r\nenduring agreement. This can be achieved only once we\r\nagree on a comprehensive package that includes Israel’s\r\ncomplete withdrawal from the territories of Syria,\r\nLebanon, the West Bank and Gaza in Palestine; the\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State; an agreement on the\r\nfinal status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian\r\nrefugees; an agreement on security requirements, without\r\nundue exaggeration; the recognition of Israel as a State;\r\nand coexistence with it as a member of the family of the\r\nMiddle East, within the framework of normal relations. I\r\nrepeat that all this must constitute a package deal that\r\ncannot be divided to serve the interests of one party at the\r\nexpense of the others.\r\nDoes the Israeli Government recognize the\r\nimportance of justice and legitimacy? Does it realize the\r\ngrave and present danger of spurning this opportunity to\r\nachieve peace? Letting this historic opportunity slip away\r\nand entering the next century with the file of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict still open will lead to tension and\r\ninstability not only in the Middle East, but in the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\ninternational community as a whole. Historical experience\r\nhas proven that tension knows no boundaries, that\r\ninstability cannot be confined to one specific region and\r\nthat international peace and security are indivisible.\r\nThe international community must therefore raise its\r\nvoice against the setback of the peace process and play its\r\nrole in salvaging it. We are not calling for an international\r\ntrial. Rather, we ask the international community to play its\r\nrole in safeguarding the bases of peace agreed upon\r\nunanimously in the Security Council and at the Madrid\r\nConference, and in the consideration of the measures\r\nnecessary to restore the process to its correct track and to\r\navert the eruption of further crises in the future.\r\nIt was in this spirit that Presidents Hosni Mubarak and\r\nJacques Chirac announced their initiative to convene a\r\nconference of States determined to save the peace. We must\r\nemphasize that this Franco-Egyptian initiative does not aim\r\nat replacing or hampering any current positive efforts. It\r\naims, rather, at reinforcing these efforts and ensuring their\r\nsuccess, particularly those of the United States, which we\r\nsupport as long as they seek balanced agreements.\r\nEgypt accords equal attention to issues of the African\r\ncontinent. Today, we are faced with two urgent and serious\r\nmatters. The first pertains to the Horn of Africa, namely,\r\nthe conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We strongly\r\nsupport the mediation efforts, led by the Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, to arrive at a peaceful\r\nsolution and the continued cessation of military hostilities.\r\nIn this way will normalcy be restored and peace\r\nestablished.\r\nThe second question is the situation in and around the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Here, the efforts made\r\nby the leaders of Africa and the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral continue to be important. Such efforts preserve the\r\nunity and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and establish positive relations between it and its\r\nneighbours in the larger context of a cessation of military\r\noperations and of interference in its internal affairs. They\r\nalso require the maintenance of its national unity within\r\nrational democracy.\r\nThe situation in Africa is being dangerously\r\naggravated by these problems and by the continent’s grave\r\nsocio-economic situation. This requires special attention,\r\nwhich we call on the international community and the\r\nUnited Nations to give.\r\nIn conclusion, I must refer to the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization. We must face its challenges and address its\r\nnegative aspects, while maximizing its benefits. A number\r\nof developing countries have successfully dealt with\r\nglobalization and achieved their necessary integration into\r\nthe world economy. At the same time, many developed\r\ncountries have adopted covert protectionist measures and\r\nnew conditionalities, such as environmental and labour\r\nstandards, and continue to maintain tariff barriers against\r\nthe primary exports of the developing countries. These\r\nmeasures run counter to the equitable bases of the world\r\ntrading system. This is an important issue which we must\r\naddress in the context of evaluating past achievements\r\nand challenges, and of shaping a new international order.\r\nThese are the questions which Egypt wished to put\r\nbefore this session as a modest contribution to shaping a\r\ncommon vision that would inspire the march of humanity\r\nin the coming decades, during which we hope that justice,\r\nequality, progress and prosperity will prevail.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now give the floor to the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and\r\nCooperation of Luxembourg, His Excellency Mr. Jacques\r\nF. Poos.\r\nMr. Poos (Luxembourg) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): As previous speakers have done, I would like to\r\nconvey to the President my sincerest congratulations on\r\nhis election to the presidency at the fifty-third session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I am convinced that our Assembly\r\nwill benefit greatly from his sense of authority and\r\nleadership. I also wish to express my gratitude to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his\r\ncommitment and perseverance in conducting our work\r\nduring the fifty-second session.\r\nThe Secretary-General of our Organization is\r\ndevoting tireless energy to opening up new avenues for\r\nour common efforts. He has emphasized the crucial\r\nimportance of good communications to ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations will be a catalyst both for those directly\r\ninvolved in international life and for our peoples. We\r\nshare that belief with him and encourage him in that\r\nrespect.\r\nLast Tuesday, members heard the statement of\r\nMr. Schüssel, President of the Council of the European\r\nUnion. He spoke on behalf of all of the countries of the\r\nEuropean Union, and Luxembourg fully supports the\r\nviews expressed.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nThe presence of representatives of 185 States in this\r\nHall reflects our common concern to ensure balance and\r\nsecurity among nations, but also within our societies. Our\r\nconcern is to ensure the permanence of values to which we\r\nare all committed in an ever-evolving world. In the context\r\nof its mandate to preserve international peace and security,\r\nour Organization regularly asks whether it has the means to\r\nensure that the general interest, as perceived by our\r\ncitizens, prevails. Surely, we must not be overly ambitious.\r\nWe are aware of the complexity and the magnitude of the\r\nsituations we face, and that these impose limits on our\r\naction. Therefore we must focus our operations and provide\r\nan appropriate framework for them. It is also our duty to\r\nacquire the means to act effectively whenever our\r\nineffectiveness or slow response would seem to negatively\r\naffect the weakest among us.\r\nLuxembourg supports the efforts under way to provide\r\nour Organization with permanent structures and to make\r\navailable to it forces prepared for rapid and effective\r\nintervention whenever the Security Council, guarantor of\r\nthe preservation of peace and security, deems it necessary.\r\nOur common efforts to make our world safer suffered\r\na serious setback following the nuclear tests recently carried\r\nout by two major countries in South Asia. We noted with\r\nsatisfaction that the representatives of India and Pakistan\r\nhave just announced from this rostrum that their countries\r\nare prepared to join the international community by\r\nacceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nWe invite them to proceed in that direction as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\nWill these efforts appear absurd, given the endless\r\npursuit of the tragic discussion about the disarmament of\r\nIraq? This spring the Security Council endorsed the\r\nmemorandum of understanding submitted to it following the\r\nSecretary-General’s visit to Baghdad. Since then, such\r\ncooperation has been called into question. Such abrupt\r\nchanges generate concern and discouragement and call into\r\nquestion the credibility of our Organization. It is the\r\nSecurity Council’s responsibility to take the necessary steps\r\nto ensure that its decisions in this area are fully respected.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nOur Organization is pursuing conflict prevention and\r\npeacekeeping. At the recent meeting between the United\r\nNations and the representatives of regional organizations,\r\nthe proposal for development of a culture of prevention was\r\nput forward. Progress has been made in the concept of\r\nmutually supportive institutions and on support for the\r\ninitiatives taken at the regional and subregional level.\r\nWhile it is desirable to support such initiatives and\r\nefforts, we must remember that the Charter confers\r\nprinciple responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security on the Security Council\r\nand that the Council must fully play its role. We welcome\r\nthe fact that in 1998 the Council once again authorized\r\ntwo peacekeeping operations, one in Sierra Leone and the\r\nother in the Central African Republic.\r\nThe Ottowa conference on the prohibition of anti-\r\npersonnel mines was undeniably an invigorating success\r\nin an area which constantly creates innocent victims. This\r\ntreaty, which has just entered into force, will make it\r\npossible to save many human lives. The news that anti-\r\npersonnel mines are again being sown in Angola and\r\nalong the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nis terrifying. Such action, if confirmed, must be\r\ncondemned vigorously.\r\nIn Kosovo, the violence directed against the civilian\r\npopulation must end. It proves that the Federal Republic\r\nof Yugoslavia continues to follow paths which cannot but\r\ncompromise progress in its integration into international\r\nand European structures. Armed action conducted by\r\nAlbanian groups in Kosovo must also end. The scorn for\r\nhuman suffering displayed by the Serbian leaders and the\r\nextremists in Kosovo is incomprehensible.\r\nA new status for Kosovo must emerge. It is\r\ninconceivable that such a status can emerge under the\r\nsway of threat or, even worse, cold-hearted implacable\r\nviolence, which would merely drive the wedge deeper to\r\nthe point where the very idea of understanding would be\r\nabsurd. As Security Council resolution 1199 (1998)\r\nrequires, a political solution must be negotiated between\r\nthe parties under the aegis of the international community.\r\nFirm cohesion between Europe, the United States and the\r\nRussian Federation should enable those in the region, as\r\nwas the case previously, to address their future in a more\r\nrational and orderly way.\r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the extremist tendencies\r\nare on the decline. This political progress was rapidly\r\nreflected in concrete results achieved in the field, and\r\ntoday this war-torn country is engaged in reconstruction.\r\nIt is comforting to note that a growing number of\r\nindividuals charged with war crimes have been sent to the\r\nTribunal at The Hague. The establishment and the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nfunctioning of the structures decided on in the context of\r\nthe peace process are today becoming a reality.\r\nThe recent elections have confirmed this new realism.\r\nIt is up to the international community to consolidate this\r\ntrend, as it still appears to be fragile, and to ensure, in\r\nparticular, the return of refugees and displaced persons.\r\nThis latter question is particularly acute in Croatia and\r\nAlbania.\r\nAnother key element for opening the way to a brighter\r\nfuture is a firm, unequivocal commitment by the regional\r\nparties and the international community. I refer to the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East. Five years after the Oslo\r\nagreements, we must note the stagnation of the peace\r\nprocess, whose logic — the principle of land for peace —\r\nthe current Israeli Government never really accepted.\r\nThe archaic and paralysing philosophy of refusal has\r\nunfortunately returned to the foreground; it is reflected in\r\nmany initiatives which only increase tension, thus nullifying\r\nthe efforts of those who advocate peace. The political\r\nleaders involved must reverse this trend so as to return to\r\nthe good faith implementation of all the provisions of the\r\nOslo agreements.\r\nOur action, in that region and in others, must focus on\r\nconvincing the parties involved that there is no alternative\r\nto peace.\r\nIt is regrettable that this central concept is also being\r\ncalled into question in a number of African regions. Tribal\r\nrivalries and resentments continue to supplant\r\nclearsightedness and the desire for good governance. In no\r\ncase should the political leaders involved in the different\r\nflashpoints feel that their only choice is between submitting\r\nto events and shirking their responsibilities.\r\nThe struggles for influence and the war in and around\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo are on the verge of\r\ndegenerating into a regional conflict and bringing about a\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe there too.\r\nThe causes of conflicts and the promotion of peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa call for a united\r\nresponse. The debate at ministerial level that the Security\r\nCouncil has just held on these topics was very helpful. The\r\nGeneral Assembly will have occasion to consider this\r\nquestion over the course of its fifty-third session, with a\r\nview to a discussion on possible measures. While the future\r\nof Africa depends first of all on the efforts of Africans\r\nthemselves, the international community must be actively\r\ninvolved in order to ensure respect for international law,\r\nand in order to carry out its duty of solidarity.\r\nRecent events, with the terrible bombings perpetrated\r\nin Africa and Northern Ireland, remind us once again of\r\nthe intolerable nature of terrorism. It is up to the\r\ninternational community to acquire an effective means of\r\ncombating this scourge on an international level, and to\r\nensure that the perpetrators of such acts answer for their\r\ncrimes before the competent courts. We owe it to\r\nourselves to put a definitive end to the culture of\r\nimpunity in connection with terrorism.\r\nAnother priority for our General Assembly is reform\r\nof the Organization. We welcome the fact that some\r\nprogress was made during the fifty-second session. But\r\nreform cannot be an isolated event; it must become a\r\nprocess that underlies all of our action. We pledge to\r\ncontinue actively supporting the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and to add our efforts to his, with a view to\r\ngiving the United Nations the capacity to respond in a\r\nflexible and evolving way to the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nAny in-depth reform of the system will remain\r\nfragile so long as the Organization lacks sound and\r\nreliable financial resources. The grave financial crisis\r\nwhich the Organization has experienced for a number of\r\nyears must be considered as a threat to the effectiveness\r\nof the whole. Our proposed reforms will be consolidated\r\nonly when all Member States have agreed fully to meet\r\ntheir obligations under the Charter by paying their arrears\r\nto the United Nations, and by paying on time and\r\nunconditionally the full amount of their obligatory\r\ncontributions, both to the Organization’s regular budget\r\nand to the peacekeeping budget.\r\nThe maintenance of security and peace in the world\r\ncannot be dissociated from the international community’s\r\nefforts on behalf of development.\r\nWhen we see entire regions, even subcontinents,\r\nexperiencing poverty and malnutrition, there is a shocking\r\nimbalance which will soon pose a threat to the security of\r\nthe States concerned and to respect for the fundamental\r\nrights of the human individual.\r\nWhen we see that generations of young people can\r\nhope for no future but unemployment or a frustrating\r\ninactivity, there exists a flagrant and unjust imbalance\r\nwhich will be a source of conflict.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nWhen we see social categories permanently deprived\r\nof education and health care, that, too, is an imbalance to\r\nwhich we cannot be indifferent.\r\nThe economic, financial and social crisis currently\r\nbesetting South-East Asia, Latin America and Russia has\r\nexacerbated this trend. Rationally, the international\r\ncommunity must acknowledge that the means of\r\nintervention traditionally, and almost mechanically,\r\nemployed to overcome economic crises have proved\r\nineffective this time.\r\nIn his work Civilisation matérielle, économie et\r\ncapitalisme, Fernand Braudel pointed out the profound\r\nsource of this crisis:\r\n“the emergence of a savage capitalism, as distinct\r\nfrom what we consider to be a market economy”.\r\nA market economy, and particularly a social market\r\neconomy, cannot do without a stable State capable of\r\nregulating competition and protecting the weak.\r\nThe strengthening or restoration of a democratic,\r\nworking State in the countries in crisis seems to me to be\r\nan absolute priority.\r\nThe international community cannot shirk the\r\nobligation to shoulder its responsibilities and lend a strong\r\nhand. It will do this not only because of its duty of\r\nsolidarity, but because the interests of one and all are\r\nlinked.\r\nAnother area in which the interdependence of our\r\nobjectives is particularly visible and tangible is that of the\r\nmanagement of the world’s natural resources. It is clear that\r\nwe need to be ambitious when it comes to the long-term\r\nmanagement of our environment.\r\nLast year we met here in special session to undertake\r\nan initial evaluation of the implementation of the\r\ncommitments undertaken at the Conference on Environment\r\nand Development a little over six years ago. At Rio de\r\nJaneiro and during last year’s evaluation session we defined\r\nthe concept of a world partnership for sustainable\r\ndevelopment, a partnership respecting the fact that the\r\nprotection of the environment cannot be dissociated from\r\nthe economic and social development process.\r\nUndeniable progress has been made in recent years:\r\nthe entry into force of the Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity\r\nand the Convention to Combat Desertification. But it must\r\nbe acknowledged that the world environment has\r\ncontinued to deteriorate.\r\nAccordingly, it is essential to accelerate the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, the programme of action\r\nadopted in Rio de Janeiro.\r\nLuxembourg intends to shoulder its share of this\r\nresponsibility. Accordingly, we have undertaken, in the\r\ncontext of the commitments made by the European Union\r\nat the Kyoto Conference, to reduce our emissions of six\r\ngreenhouse gases to 28 per cent below 1990 levels by the\r\nyear 2012.\r\nIn the context of the Biodiversity Convention, we\r\nalso plan to establish a national network of protected\r\nareas covering 10 per cent of our national territory.\r\nThe goal of managing the world’s material resources\r\nas a good parent would reflect an atavistic concern, that\r\nof guaranteeing security through careful preparation for\r\nthe future, in particular through suitable education.\r\nThe recent Lisbon Conference devoted to the\r\nproblems faced by young people rightly emphasized the\r\nneed to provide training that is suited to the job market so\r\nas to prevent unemployment and marginalization. Such\r\ntraining must include education about responsibility. We\r\ntherefore welcome the fact that the Lisbon Declaration\r\ncommits Governments to ensuring the participation of\r\nyoung people in programmes that concern them. In that\r\nway we can come closer to democratic civic education\r\nbased on the rights and responsibilities of citizens and on\r\nthe participation of young people in civil society.\r\nLuxembourg has undertaken a long-term effort to\r\nmake its own contribution to providing funds for\r\ndevelopment. Our efforts are aimed at attaining the target\r\nset by the United Nations of 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct for official development assistance before the end\r\nof the millennium. Our efforts occupy an important place\r\nin the struggle against poverty, which is one of the main\r\nobstacles to development. At present our contribution is\r\n0.56 per cent of gross national product and is equivalent\r\nto official development assistance of $195 per capita.\r\nAccording to those criteria, Luxembourg is fifth among\r\ndonor countries in the Development Assistance\r\nCommittee.\r\nFifty years ago our Organization adopted the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. For the first\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\ntime, a universal organization declared its determination to\r\nplace respect for human rights at the heart of international\r\nrelations. Since then, we have made considerable progress\r\ntowards ensuring recognition for the universal value of such\r\nrights and their effective enjoyment.\r\nSeveral international instruments have been added to\r\nthe Universal Declaration so as to focus more precisely on\r\nwhat human rights represent and to ensure that the citizens\r\nof all countries of the world effectively enjoy these rights.\r\nOur Organization has established the post of High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, and concern for human\r\nrights now underlies all of its activities. This progress leads\r\nus to believe that human rights will find the central and\r\npermanent home at the heart of international life that they\r\ndeserve.\r\nWe also note that the Criminal Tribunals established\r\nby the United Nations to bring to trial those accused of\r\ncrimes committed during recent wars in the former\r\nYugoslavia and Rwanda have recently been able to\r\nstrengthen their authority and the scope of their action. This\r\naffirmation of their importance played a considerable role\r\nin the preparation of the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court. I sincerely welcome the positive conclusion\r\nof the work of the recent Rome Conference. At the same\r\ntime, I should like to emphasize the fact that the entire\r\ninternational community has given that new institution\r\nstrong and constant support.\r\nThe end of the culture of impunity represents a\r\ndecisive turning point in international relations at the end of\r\nthis century. But this turning point will be convincing only\r\nif the Members of our Organization display a commitment\r\nto provide the new Court with the necessary credibility.\r\nIn this commemorative year, we must ensure that our\r\nachievements are assessed in depth and that we avoid\r\ncomplacency in the field of human rights. Only in this way\r\nwill it be possible to expand the base on which we can\r\nbuild the values that the international community has so\r\noften said it is prepared to ensure for humankind as a\r\nwhole.\r\nI am confident that the United Nations will remain\r\ncapable of steadfastly pursuing the attainment of the great\r\nobjectives it has set itself: to serve men and women, ensure\r\nrespect for their rights, preserve them from the scourge of\r\nwar and lead them towards development and fulfilment.\r\nLuxembourg’s support will certainly not be lacking.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nCanada, His Excellency The Honourable Lloyd Axworthy,\r\non whom I now call.\r\nMr. Axworthy (Canada): Allow me to congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. With your experience and dedication to the\r\ngoals of this Organization, you will guide us wisely and\r\neffectively in our work this year.\r\nAnd important work it is, for as the century draws\r\nto a close, our security is more precarious than ever. The\r\nspectrum of threats is wide and growing. Traditional\r\ndangers persist, including the proliferation of weapons.\r\nBut new threats — terrorism, crime and drugs — arise\r\nfrom a world in which the face of conflict has changed.\r\nEconomic and social insecurity for the majority of our\r\nglobal population is on the rise. Increasingly, it is the\r\nwell-being of individuals that is directly at stake.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThere is an urgent need for solutions. The\r\ninterdependence of all of our lives is unprecedented. It is\r\nessential for us to work together to confront these\r\nchallenges. This means working through a vibrant United\r\nNations. For Canada, the universal values set out in the\r\nCharter have acted as our moral compass in setting our\r\nglobal agenda. The United Nations system serves as the\r\ninstrument in achieving our goals.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAt the same time we recognize that the United\r\nNations faces its own worries, and it, too, must change.\r\nBut a strong, reinvigorated United Nations is still the best\r\nfoundation for the future. As the contours of that future\r\nemerge, there is reason for hope. While old realities of\r\npower persist, a new system based on humanitarian\r\nstandards, practices and law based upon needs and human\r\nsecurity is beginning to show through.\r\nPerhaps this new reality can best be seen in the\r\ncommon effort to eliminate anti-personnel landmines. The\r\nSecretary-General has hailed the adoption of the Ottawa\r\nConvention as an unprecedented achievement — one\r\naccomplished through a unique partnership of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, Member States and\r\ninternational groups working together to eliminate a\r\nweapons system that victimizes the innocent.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nLast week, Burkina Faso deposited the fortieth\r\nratification of the treaty, thereby crossing the threshold\r\nneeded to bring the treaty into force. This treaty, which has\r\nalready attracted 130 signatories and 41 ratifications, will\r\nbecome part of the international legal framework as of 1\r\nMarch next year. We welcome the offer by Mozambique to\r\nhost the first meeting of the States parties to the\r\nConvention. We continue to urge those who have not done\r\nso to sign and ratify the Convention and join in this\r\ninternational endeavour.\r\nBut entry into force is just the first important step in\r\nbringing the treaty to life. Now we have to meet the\r\ntreaty’s goals. An effective coalition for action must work\r\ntogether in this next phase to take the mines out of the\r\nground and to help the victims. The United Nations,\r\nthrough its mine action service, will mobilize and\r\ncoordinate the efforts of the international community.\r\nAt the signing of the treaty on landmines in Ottawa\r\nlast December, countries pledged $0.5 billion for mine\r\naction. My own Government has allocated $100 million as\r\nCanada’s contribution to rid the world of these very cruel\r\nweapons. We have already put the money to work in some\r\nof the most severely affected States, with projects in\r\nMozambique, Cambodia, Bosnia and Central America. Now\r\nwe must put everyone’s resources to work.\r\nLandmines are not the only weapons that take a tragic,\r\ndisproportionate toll on civilian populations. Small arms\r\nand light military weapons — cheap and easy to transport,\r\nsmuggle or hide — have become the tools of choice for\r\nsmugglers, terrorists and criminals.\r\nThe challenges arising from the proliferation and\r\nwidespread abuse of small arms and light weapons are\r\ncomplex. But the impact on all of us, especially the most\r\nvulnerable, is direct and devastating. Eighty per cent of the\r\nvictims are women and children. There are no easy\r\nsolutions and no shortcuts. We cannot, however, afford to\r\nshrink from facing such a pervasive threat to our security.\r\nIn Canada we pursue a three-pronged approach, dealing\r\nwith the legal trade, illicit trafficking and peace-building\r\nchallenges of small-arms proliferation. We hope, by\r\nworking with others in the United Nations, to see the use\r\nof this terrible weapon come to an end.\r\nIllegal drug-trafficking also threatens our peoples’\r\nsecurity. The drug trade affects governance, undermines\r\nhuman rights and promotes cross-border conflicts. That is\r\nwhy Canada has proposed a Foreign Ministers’ dialogue\r\ngroup in the Americas. We hope that this will be a forum\r\nwhich can provide guidance and generate ideas to help us\r\ncurtail the collateral impact of the drug trade on\r\nGovernments and on society. These and other emerging\r\nthreats to our security, including terrorism, crime and\r\nenvironmental degradation, affect every one of us but are\r\nbeyond the reach of any of us alone. They demand global,\r\nintegrated solutions, which the United Nations is best\r\nsuited to provide. The International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, concluded last year,\r\nongoing work in developing a convention on transnational\r\norganized crime and the Kyoto Protocol to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change — all\r\nshow that we are capable of working together to enhance\r\nour human security.\r\nMoving the human security agenda forward also\r\nrequires that we redouble efforts to address the root\r\ncauses of conflict and risk. Peace and stability are\r\nindispensable to security, but they are not, regrettably,\r\nhumanity’s birthright. They must be built. Two years ago,\r\nwe launched the Canadian Peace-building Initiative. Its\r\nobjective is to address the unique challenges of societies\r\nrecovering from conflict. Through this initiative, projects\r\nhave been undertaken in Guatemala to assist civil society\r\nto implement the peace agreements, in Bosnia to promote\r\nawareness of the peace accords, in Mozambique to\r\nsupport a programme to exchange weapons for farming\r\ntools, and in West Africa to support the initiative led by\r\nMali to promote a West African arms moratorium. These\r\nare small steps, certainly, but constructive ones in\r\nworking locally to build peace.\r\nToday, I am pleased to release a report entitled\r\n“Peace in Progress”, which documents the results\r\nobtained to date and the wide range of partners with\r\nwhom we have worked. As the title suggests, Canada\r\nintends to carry on with its partners in empowering those\r\nworking to build peaceful and stable societies in their\r\nown countries.\r\nIt has been a half-century since a distinguished\r\nCanadian international civil servant, John Humphrey,\r\nwrote the first draft of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. Since then over 60 international human\r\nrights instruments have been adopted. Countries have\r\nshown a new and welcome willingness to cooperate with\r\nthe international human rights system.\r\nBut we must build on that progress, and one of the\r\nmost important ways that the Assembly can make its\r\ncontribution this year is to support a strong United\r\nNations declaration on human rights defenders to protect\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nthose who are protecting those whose human rights are\r\nbeing abused.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe growing integration of human rights, including\r\nwomen’s rights, into all other aspects of United Nations\r\nactivity is a recent and important breakthrough. On the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, the conditions exist to achieve progress in attaining\r\nthe goals set out by its drafters. This is good news.\r\nHowever, a review of the human rights situation around the\r\nglobe makes it painfully clear that we remain far short of\r\nthese goals.\r\nWe need to take advantage of the momentum that this\r\nanniversary presents. The United Nations human rights\r\nsystem must be assured of both the political support of the\r\nmembership and increased regular budget financing if it is\r\nto do the job we have entrusted to it.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe growth of intra-State conflicts caused by\r\ndifferences of religion, language, race or ethnicity has\r\nreinforced the need to protect marginalized groups. To do\r\nso, both Governments and civil society must have ready\r\naccess to information about human rights situations around\r\nthe world. To this end, Canada has launched for the record\r\nan annual report drawn from United Nations sources, which\r\nwe are making available on the Internet to provide constant\r\nupdated information concerning human rights around the\r\nglobe.\r\nCertainly, of those at risk from conflict, none are more\r\nat risk than children. The targeting of children in\r\nwarfare — both as fighters and as victims — is intolerable.\r\nThe ground-breaking efforts of Graça Machel and the work\r\nof the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for\r\nChildren and Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, merit special\r\nand ongoing support.\r\nEnhancing human security also requires establishing\r\nlegal instruments. The agreement in Rome to establish the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is a major fundamental step\r\ntowards that goal. This Court will help to deter some of the\r\nmost serious violations of international humanitarian law.\r\nIt will help give new meaning and global reach to\r\nprotecting the vulnerable and the innocent. By isolating and\r\nstigmatizing those who commit war crimes or genocide and\r\nremoving them from the community, it will help end cycles\r\nof impunity and retribution. Without justice there is no\r\nreconciliation, and without reconciliation there can be no\r\npeace.\r\nWe need to move forward urgently in making the\r\nCourt a reality. We should begin during this session of\r\nthe General Assembly to bring the Court into operation.\r\nWe who have supported the Court should ratify the\r\nStatute as soon as possible. We must also work to\r\nunderstand and address the concerns of those States that\r\nremain hesitant about the Court — without diluting its\r\neffectiveness. Ultimately, we must ensure that we have an\r\ninstitution that will be credible, responsible and effective.\r\nRespect for civil and political rights is necessary, but\r\nin itself is not sufficient to create the conditions for stable\r\nsocieties. Stability also requires economic and social well-\r\nbeing.\r\nRegrettably, statistics show that countries with the\r\nlowest income are much more likely to fall victim to\r\nviolent conflict than others. The number of people whose\r\nbasic human needs are not being met remains\r\nunacceptably and dangerously high. A quarter of the\r\nworld’s people live in severe poverty; more than 800\r\nmillion face malnutrition; 180 million children under the\r\nage of 14 work as child labourers. As the United Nations\r\nhuman development index makes clear this year, the gap\r\nbetween the haves and the have-nots continues to grow.\r\nCountries overburdened by debt are less likely to be\r\ndeveloped and more likely to succumb to conflict.\r\nReducing the debt of the least developed nations allows\r\nthem to devote more resources to basic human needs.\r\nThat is why at the summit of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) in Ouagadougou I announced a $20 million\r\ncontribution to the African Development Bank to support\r\nthe most heavily indebted African countries. That is also\r\nwhy Canada has forgiven virtually all development-related\r\ndebt owed to us by the least developed countries —\r\nalmost $1 billion — and why we encourage others who\r\nhave not already done so to do likewise.\r\nI think we all recognize that globalization presents\r\nopportunities, but it also exposes all of us, especially the\r\nmost vulnerable, to greater economic and social\r\ninsecurity. The international financial turmoil of the past\r\nmonths vividly demonstrates the impact these crises can\r\nhave on the daily lives of the least fortunate. It means\r\nthat we need to be sensitive to the social consequences of\r\nfinancial volatility. And when crisis strikes, the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies have a special\r\nresponsibility to assist those most severely affected.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nThere is no greater threat to our security than nuclear\r\nproliferation. In 1945, Canada, despite the experience of the\r\nmost destructive war in history, decided to forgo the\r\nnuclear option even though, as a participant in the\r\nManhattan Project, we had the technical capability and\r\nmaterial capacity to build our own nuclear weapons. In\r\n1968, the Government of Canada confirmed that decision\r\nand joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT). Every subsequent Canadian Government\r\nhas reaffirmed that commitment, and we have spent much\r\ndiplomatic effort to persuade others that nuclear weapons\r\nare the problem, not the solution.\r\nThe non-proliferation regime has enhanced everyone’s\r\nsecurity. The credibility of that regime has been severely\r\ntested over the years, but particularly over the past six\r\nmonths. India’s and Pakistan’s nuclear tests put the entire\r\nnon-proliferation regime in jeopardy. Nuclear testing\r\nundermines the basic goals and objectives of the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty. Testing puts all of us, not least the people of\r\nthe testing countries themselves, at greater risk. Therefore,\r\nthere can be no condoning these actions.\r\nAnd there must be no rewards. We must not legitimize\r\nthe claims of would-be nuclear Powers, or confer any new\r\nstatus on proliferators. We listened carefully to the\r\npresentations of the Presidents of India and of Pakistan this\r\nweek and we welcome the indications they gave that they\r\nwould sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nBut it is important to reiterate that Security Council\r\nresolution 1172 (1998) calls upon India and Pakistan to sign\r\nthe Treaty without conditions, to participate purposefully in\r\nthe negotiations on a cut-off treaty on fissile materials, to\r\nstop the weaponization of their nuclear programmes, to\r\nimpose strict export controls on nuclear technology and to\r\nembrace fully the non-proliferation regime. We urge them\r\nto do so.\r\nIn that spirit, we welcome India’s and Pakistan’s\r\ndecision to relaunch their dialogue on Kashmir. We also\r\nrecognize that preventing horizontal proliferation, while\r\ncrucial, is no more important than preventing vertical\r\nproliferation. Nuclear disarmament is the other half of the\r\nnuclear bargain. That bargain is a balance of responsibilities\r\nand obligations undertaken by nuclear-weapon and non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States alike. Not all nuclear-weapon States\r\nhave begun to fulfil their obligations under Article VI of\r\nthe Non-proliferation Treaty, and we call upon them to\r\nfulfil their responsibilities.\r\nAs we all recognize, this period of globalization\r\nmultiplies the challenges. It is Canada’s conviction that a\r\ndynamic, responsive and flexible United Nations system\r\nis the best way, perhaps the only way, to meet these\r\nchallenges.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nTo fulfil its leadership responsibilities, the United\r\nNations must be assured of reliable and adequate funding.\r\nWe cannot revitalize the United Nations so long as\r\nMember States, particularly the most wealthy and\r\nfortunate among them, contribute less to a system from\r\nwhich they demand more. Renewal can be achieved only\r\nif Member States pay their assessed dues, present and\r\npast due, on time and without conditions.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet me now speak of the Security Council. The\r\nSecurity Council remains at the centre of what the United\r\nNations is all about: protecting against conflict and human\r\nrisk. However, the Council’s legitimacy is increasingly\r\nbeing questioned. To remain credible, the Council must\r\nre-examine traditional interpretations of its mandate. The\r\nCouncil needs to broaden its horizons in addressing\r\nemerging threats which impact on our security. Thematic\r\ndebates on these issues, in which all Member States can\r\nparticipate, are a good step. The addition of peace-\r\nbuilding to the Council’s range of responses to threats to\r\npeace and security is also welcome.\r\nBut the Council must also be more willing and more\r\nconsistent in both how and when it becomes involved.\r\nThe Council belongs to all Member States. It cannot be\r\nallowed to focus on solving the problems of one region\r\nand be indifferent to those of others.\r\nThe way the Council does its work must be more\r\nopen and more transparent. For example, Member States\r\ninvolved in and affected by matters before the Council\r\nmust be allowed to exercise their Charter rights. Far from\r\nconstraining the Council’s efficiency, this will improve\r\nthe decisions it takes and render its actions more\r\neffective. The trend for permanent members increasingly\r\nto assume more control over the agenda, thereby\r\nmarginalizing elected members, runs counter to the\r\ndemocratic principles which so inform our political\r\ninstitutions at the close of the twentieth century. The\r\ndistinctions between permanent and elected members need\r\nto be narrowed rather than widened.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nIn sum, the Council we need for the next century must\r\nbe more responsible, more accountable and less\r\nimpenetrable. We hope that members will support Canada\r\nin advancing these aspirations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Viet Nam, His Excellency Mr. Nguyen\r\nManh Cam.\r\nMr. Nguyen Manh Cam (Viet Nam) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist\r\nRepublic of Viet Nam, I would like to extend our warmest\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, upon your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am\r\nconvinced that under your wise guidance the work of this\r\nsession will be crowned with success.\r\nI wish also to express our high appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, for his major\r\ncontribution during the fifty-second session, which\r\nbenefited from his effectiveness as President. I warmly\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his active contribution over the past\r\nyear to the activities of the United Nations and to the\r\nreform process.\r\nAn eventful year has elapsed since the fifty-second\r\nsession. While undergoing the intense and unpredictable\r\nimpact generated by the unprecedented financial and\r\nmonetary crisis, the world community has had to face\r\ntremendous challenges emerging out of tensions and\r\nconflicts in many corners of the world, out of policies of\r\nhegemony and imposition, and out of social injustice and\r\nthe growing gap between rich and poor countries. However,\r\npeace, stability and cooperation for development continue\r\nto mark the prevailing international trend; that trend derives\r\nfrom the age-old aspirations of humankind and, above all,\r\nfrom the pressing demand of all peoples in the face of\r\ntoday’s swiftly changing and complex world. That\r\nprevailing trend is becoming all the more established in a\r\nworld context of growing interdependence and of the\r\nspeedier pace of globalization and regionalization. This\r\nsituation also presents the international community with as\r\nmany challenges as opportunities. It must therefore be\r\nemphasized that least developed and developing countries\r\nare also confronted with considerable challenges, and that\r\nthe world’s development takes place in a context of various\r\nclosely linked factors that have reciprocal impacts.\r\nIn the light of the many important advances that have\r\nbeen made in science and technology, no one can deny the\r\nrole played by developed countries. But the overall\r\ndevelopment of the integrated global economy cannot\r\noccur without the active participation of developing\r\ncountries, which account for the majority of the members\r\nof the international community.\r\nGlobalization is characterized principally by the\r\nrapid expansion of trade and economic relations and the\r\nswift movement of capital at the international level. We\r\nmust nevertheless acknowledge that despite the twelve-\r\nfold growth in the global volume of trade since the end of\r\nthe Second World War, the share of developing countries\r\nregistered just a modest increase while that of least\r\ndeveloped countries has been halved in the last two\r\ndecades and currently stands at 0.4 per cent of the total\r\nvalue of international trade. Since the world’s capital\r\nmoves faster than trade grows, developed countries are\r\nthe principal beneficiaries of these resources, with the rest\r\ngoing to a limited number of developing countries.\r\nIn an environment of economic opening up,\r\ncharacterized by the growing liberalization of trade and\r\ninvestment, developing countries — having\r\nundercapitalized industries, less efficient management and\r\ndilapidated equipment — have to confront unequal and\r\nrelentless competition in which absolute superiority is\r\nenjoyed by countries that have advanced technologies at\r\ntheir disposal and to multinational corporations whose\r\nrevenues are sometimes even higher than the gross\r\nnational product of some countries. Undoubtedly, this\r\ncannot but cause concern to the developing and least\r\ndeveloped countries that are beginning their global and\r\nregional economic integration.\r\nAdditionally, although the current financial and\r\nmonetary crisis began in East Asia, it is no longer an East\r\nAsian phenomenon, but has spread like an oil slick to the\r\nrest of the world and now resembles a dangerous storm\r\ncausing unpredictable losses across many countries in\r\ndifferent continents. This illustrates the negative side\r\neffects of globalization and provides additional proof of\r\nthe fact that the greater the rate of globalization, the more\r\ninterrelated both developed and developing economies\r\nbecome and the more they influence one another.\r\nThis situation calls for the international community’s\r\nprogramme of action to include mutual cooperation\r\nbetween the developed countries and developing and least\r\ndeveloped countries; and among countries that have\r\nstrong economies, international institutions and the\r\ncountries in crisis. It is only through this basic approach\r\nof mutual assistance that developing countries and\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\ncountries in crisis will have an opportunity to join in the\r\nefforts of the developed countries to overcome the problems\r\nand make the global economy’s growth more stable, which\r\nin the long run will benefit everyone. Obviously, such\r\ncooperation and mutual assistance must be based on mutual\r\ninterest and respect. It can certainly be said that in a\r\nsituation of generalized crisis, going to someone else’s aid\r\nmeans saving oneself.\r\nWe believe that in adopting this approach, developing\r\ncountries and countries in crisis should fully exploit their\r\nown domestic strengths and mobilize their existing potential\r\nto speed up and take advantage of international aid and\r\ncooperation. As far as external aid is concerned, we believe\r\nthat the individual conditions of each recipient country\r\nshould be taken into account in order to avoid the\r\nimposition of any remedy that might worsen its situation\r\nand cause unforeseen effects to social stability.\r\nFurthermore, we are convinced that in implementing these\r\nmeasures to stimulate liberalization, attention should be\r\npaid to the diversity of the global economy, as well as to\r\nthe heterogeneous nature of national and regional\r\neconomies. This is the only approach capable of ensuring\r\nthe efficiency of our cooperation, the beneficial quality of\r\nour ties and our common prosperity.\r\nIn this light, we would like to express the following\r\nhopes.\r\nMore than ever, developed countries should facilitate\r\naccess to their markets, accord most-favoured-nation status\r\nto developing countries — especially those countries which\r\nhave been ravaged by the crisis or are suffering from its\r\nconsequences — and include them in the Generalized\r\nSystem of Preferences. They should also support developing\r\nand least developed countries.\r\nIt is more necessary than ever to maintain the level of\r\nofficial development assistance. This is not only necessary\r\nto halt the downward trend, but also for donor countries to\r\nseek to reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ngross national product devoted to development by donor\r\ncountries. Moreover, this assistance is considered important\r\nfor developing countries because it allows them to\r\nstrengthen their energy resources and contributes to building\r\nboth their economic and social infrastructures, elements\r\nwhich are essential for development and in order to attract\r\nforeign investments.\r\nThe role of multilateral institutions — particularly that\r\nof the United Nations — is very important in resolving the\r\nlong- and short-term problems of developing nations.\r\nHowever, it is regrettable that United Nations assistance\r\nto developing countries is continuing to decline. We\r\ntherefore welcome the adoption of measures by the\r\nUnited Nations to improve the quality of its development\r\ncooperation, as well as the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to create a Development Account using the\r\nsavings realized from reductions in administrative costs.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), along with other international organizations and\r\nbilateral and multilateral donors, is currently working to\r\nfind solutions to the urgent problems of developing and\r\nleast developed countries. Viet Nam has in recent years\r\nbenefited from their considerable assistance, which ranged\r\nfrom restructuring the economy into a market economy to\r\nspecific activities in different areas of society, particularly\r\nin the battle to eliminate famine and reduce poverty.\r\nMore recently, the effective support provided by the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n(FAO) through the implementation of a tripartite\r\nagricultural cooperation mechanism agreed among FAO\r\nitself, Viet Nam and certain African countries has yielded\r\nencouraging results. We hope that on the basis of that\r\nexperience, the United Nations will focus more on\r\ndevelopment issues and create conditions that are more\r\nfavourable for providing assistance to the developing and\r\nless developed countries.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed the formation and\r\nexpansion of linkages among countries at the regional,\r\ninterregional, intercontinental and global levels. These\r\nmulti-level linkages among States also give rise to\r\nfavourable conditions for all nations to exploit their\r\ncomparative advantages, and they give impetus to\r\nincreased mutual assistance among various partners,\r\nwhich leads to more equitable and sustainable growth\r\nwithin each region as well as among regions.\r\nPeace, stability and development are closely\r\ninterrelated, like companions on the road to prosperity.\r\nOur own experience has taught us that a peaceful\r\nenvironment and political and social stability are\r\nindispensable for a nation to devote itself to achieving\r\neconomic development. In turn, a more developed\r\neconomy and improved living standards help strengthen\r\npolitical and social stability and thus preserve peace.\r\nTwo opposing tendencies have characterized the\r\nworld security situation since the fifty-second session. On\r\nthe one hand, numerous events have shown a continuing\r\ntrend of peace and improved relations among countries,\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nas evidenced by fact that the peaceful settlement of certain\r\ndecades-long conflicts is under way and that relations\r\namong nations, including major Powers, continue to\r\nimprove. On the other hand, we are witnessing on a daily\r\nbasis bloodshed and confrontation in many regions, from\r\nthe Middle East to Africa, from the Balkans to South Asia,\r\nand so on.\r\nThe arms race continues unabated. One terrorist act\r\nfollows on the heels of another. The list of countries to be\r\n“punished” is not getting any shorter, and the direct victims\r\ncontinue to be the elderly and women and children. Our\r\nplanet is thus not yet out of the reach of the Damocles\r\nsword of insecurity.\r\nThe painful lessons of the twentieth century — a\r\ncentury replete with conflicts and wars, including the two\r\nWorld Wars, which claimed tens of millions of lives — and\r\nthe burning desire of humankind for a better life on the eve\r\nof the new century require that we all redouble our efforts\r\nto achieve a solid and lasting peace.\r\nIn today’s world, such a peace will be achieved only\r\nif every people and every State — large or small, rich or\r\npoor, wherever its location — make every effort in jointly\r\nworking towards it. Such a peace can be achieved only if\r\nit is based on a strict observance in international relations\r\nof the principle of respect for independence, sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity; non-intervention in one another’s\r\ninternal affairs; the non-use or threat of use of force; and\r\nsanctions.\r\nSuch a peace will be established only when the goal\r\nof total disarmament is achieved, first and foremost through\r\nthe elimination of weapons of mass destruction. In this\r\nspirit, all States must put an end to the production, testing,\r\nstockpiling, proliferation, use or threat of use of these\r\nweapons.\r\nSouth-East Asia, as an integral part of the planet, is\r\naffected by current global developments. In these last 50\r\nyears, it has been a hotbed of conflicts and disputes and the\r\nscene of numerous bloody wars and crises. But today\r\nSouth-East Asia’s luck is changing, and an atmosphere of\r\npeace, stability and cooperation for development prevails.\r\nThe membership of the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) has increased, bringing it closer to\r\nits goal of 10 member countries and helping to put an end\r\nto the region’s historical divisions. The South-East Asia\r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty has been signed.\r\nNevertheless, problems remain, including sovereignty\r\ndisputes in the South China Sea, that must be resolved in\r\norder to ensure peace and stability for all countries in the\r\nregion. We believe, however, that tensions can be avoided\r\nif all parties concerned practise self-restraint; refrain from\r\naggravating the situation; ensure freedom of international\r\nmaritime transportation; settle their disputes through\r\nnegotiation on the basis of respect for international law,\r\nparticularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea; and, in the immediate future, seek to\r\nidentify patterns of cooperation acceptable to all sides.\r\nThis is in line with the all-out efforts by the countries of\r\nthe region to build neighbourly relationships of friendship\r\nand cooperation based on the principle of mutual respect.\r\nIn this spirit, as Cambodia’s immediate neighbour,\r\nwe welcome the success beyond expectations of the\r\nCambodian elections last July, which were recognized to\r\nbe free and fair by the entire international community.\r\nWe sincerely hope that this will lead to the early\r\nformation of a new government in Cambodia that will set\r\nthe Cambodian people on the road to building and\r\ndeveloping their country in conditions of peace and\r\nstability.\r\nRegrettably, East Asia in general and South-East\r\nAsia in particular, reputed in past decades to be the\r\nworld’s most dynamic economic growth area, are\r\nsuffering an unprecedentedly serious crisis. This has led\r\ncertain people hastily to declare the demise of the miracle\r\nof the East Asian development model and even go so far\r\nas to reject “Asian values”. I would humbly suggest that\r\nsuch views are groundless. Indeed, the current crisis in\r\nEast Asia is neither the first nor the last in the history of\r\nthe market economy. Although some errors were made,\r\nthe East Asia and South-East Asia development model\r\nhas already provided quite a few valuable experiences and\r\nuseful lessons.\r\nAre not the virtues of studiousness, industriousness,\r\nthrift, intelligence, creativity and caring for one another\r\neternal and universal values? Moreover, there remain\r\nsubstantial economic foundations, unique cultures and the\r\nachievements of the people of the region realized thanks\r\nto their hard work and creativity — not to mention other\r\npositive factors, such as the region’s abundant natural\r\nresources, large internal market and major role in world\r\npolitics and economics.\r\nThe existence and growth of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been another\r\npositive factor in the development of South-East Asia.\r\nDespite difficulties and challenges, ASEAN continues to\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nbecome more unified, promote cooperation and play an\r\nactive role in Asia and the Pacific and the world, not only\r\nthrough intensive interactions with dialogue partners and\r\nother international and regional organizations, but also by\r\nmeans of its vigorous work in different multilateral forums:\r\nthe ASEAN Regional Forum, the Asia/Europe Meeting, the\r\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and the United Nations itself.\r\nAfter successfully hosting the seventh summit of the\r\nFrench-speaking community in November 1997, Viet Nam\r\nhas the great honour to again play host — this time to the\r\nsixth ASEAN Summit, which will be held in Hanoi this\r\nDecember. The Summit, whose theme will be strengthening\r\nunity and broadening cooperation for a South-East Asia of\r\npeace, stability and balanced development, will adopt the\r\nHanoi declaration and plan of action, which will guide\r\nSouth-East Asia as it enters the next century.\r\nAs a result of the factors I have outlined, we are\r\nfirmly convinced that South-East Asia will soon overcome\r\nits difficulties and regain its previous pace of growth, and\r\nthat the international community will continue to regard the\r\nregion as a promising and reliable partner.\r\nTo build peace and promote development, it is\r\nurgently important to reform the United Nations, to make\r\nit more democratic and better adapted to confront the\r\nprofound changes that have taken place in the world in the\r\n50 years since the Organization was founded. We all agree\r\nthat it is essential to reform the Security Council so that it\r\nwill be more democratic, more transparent and more\r\naccountable to the General Assembly, the biggest and most\r\nrepresentative forum of the community of nations. Viet\r\nNam and its Non-Aligned Movement partners are\r\ncommitted to the position that the developing countries\r\nshould be represented in the Security Council through\r\npermanent membership. In view of the legitimate interests\r\nof potential candidates, Viet Nam will support the rotation\r\nformula if a majority of countries accept it. Our country\r\nalso supports the proposed limiting of the right of the\r\nveto — prior to abolishing it — to decisions relating to\r\nissues provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nThis year the international community will celebrate\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. We have always regarded the Declaration\r\nas a great achievement of the world’s peoples in their long\r\nstruggle for fundamental rights, the most important of\r\nwhich are the right to live in peace, independence,\r\nprosperity and happiness, and with social justice, and the\r\nright to self-determination. It is unfortunate that the issue of\r\nhuman rights has sometimes been twisted to serve as a\r\npretext for intervening and interfering in other countries’\r\naffairs. In this regard, Viet Nam greatly appreciates the\r\nposition the Non-Aligned Movement expressed in the\r\nDurban Declaration, during its recent twelfth summit\r\nmeeting, that human rights should not\r\n“be used as a political instrument for interference in\r\ninternal affairs. ... They require an environment of\r\npeace and development, respect for sovereignty,\r\nterritorial integrity and non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States. Socio-economic rights,\r\nincluding the right to development, are inextricably\r\npart of real human rights.”\r\nHaving suffered humiliation under foreign domination,\r\nhaving been ridiculed and having sacrificed innumerable\r\nlives in order to regain their human rights and dignity,\r\nour people will spare no effort to hold on to the\r\nfundamental rights they have regained.\r\nTo achieve the objective of becoming a prosperous\r\npeople, a strong State and a just and developed society,\r\nthe Vietnamese people are, and will remain, resolved to\r\npursue their policy of renewal and to industrialize and\r\nmodernize the country. To do this and promote peace,\r\ncooperation and development, Viet Nam will continue to\r\npursue its foreign policy in support of independence,\r\nsovereignty, openness, multilateralism, diversification of\r\nforeign relations, and gradual global and regional\r\nintegration. Thus Viet Nam will always be an active\r\nmember of international and regional organizations. It will\r\ncontinue to contribute to the United Nations efforts for\r\npeace and development, particularly in its capacity as a\r\nnewly elected member of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\nHumanity enters the new millennium with earnest\r\nhopes for a better and more prosperous life. At this\r\nhistoric turning point, we expect the United Nations to\r\nmake greater efforts to achieve lasting peace and a\r\nclimate of international cooperation supportive of the\r\ndevelopment of every nation. Viet Nam will spare no\r\neffort to contribute fully to the achievement of that lofty\r\ngoal.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Indrek Tarand, Permanent\r\nUnder-Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of\r\nEstonia.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nMr. Tarand (Estonia): Please allow me to extend to\r\nyou, Sir, my delegation’s sincere congratulations on your\r\nelection to preside over the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I wish you all the best in carrying out\r\nyour duties. Let me also express my appreciation for his\r\nexcellent work to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-second session.\r\nAs of today 462 days remain until the end of this\r\ncentury — a century which has recorded many phases in\r\nthe development of the world. There have been times of\r\nconfrontation and times of partnership, times of\r\nprotectiveness and times of openness.\r\nSeven years ago the walls of separation between the\r\nnations of East and West were torn down, creating\r\nopportunities for closer cooperation and economic\r\nintegration. This also opened doors for nations to promote\r\ngeneral welfare, mutual understanding and respect and the\r\nbuilding of trust and confidence in one another.\r\nAs has been said about this moment in history, it is\r\nnot so much that the borders between States are now open\r\nand can be freely crossed, but that they can be transcended.\r\nDistances and borders now have limited significance; the\r\nglobe has become a universal village in its own right.\r\nToday, the world economy appears to be sliding into\r\na deep crisis. The countries that are suffering the most are\r\nthe poorest. While I realize that globalization entails risks\r\nand challenges for economies and societies, I am convinced\r\nthat there is no alternative. The only credible formula for a\r\nviable global economy is the promotion of freer trade\r\nthrough the abolition of trade barriers and the pursuit of\r\nsustained economic and democratic reform. Once starting\r\non this path of reform, as difficult as it may be, there can\r\nbe no stepping aside for shortsighted political consideration.\r\nEstonia’s success is living proof of this.\r\nAlong with many other States, Estonia began its\r\ntransition from a Communist regime to democracy and\r\nfrom a State-controlled economy to a free market in 1991.\r\nBy 1997, Estonia had the highest economic growth rate in\r\nEurope, and preliminary figures for 1998 indicate that\r\ngrowth continues to be strong. Estonia’s inclusion among\r\nthe six countries to begin accession negotiations with the\r\nEuropean Union is a recognition of its achievements in\r\nbuilding a civil society and a well-functioning market\r\neconomy.\r\nIn my country, we are proud of the European Union\r\ninvitation. We regard the European integration process as\r\namong the most challenging yet most rewarding\r\nendeavours for our continent, today and in the distant\r\nfuture. European integration is not simply an effort to\r\nprovide our citizens with the tools for success in a\r\nglobalizing world; it is also a catalyst for greater openness\r\nthroughout the continent. We are convinced that pursuing\r\nmembership is in itself a strong guarantee for stable\r\ndevelopment, as it provides all applicants with a viable\r\nroad map to reform.\r\nEstonia greatly appreciates the help provided by the\r\nUnited Nations, other international organizations and a\r\nnumber of bilateral donors during the difficult early years\r\nof transition. Now that Estonia has entered into the post-\r\ntransitional stage of its development, we believe it is time\r\nto start paying back. During the last eight years our\r\nGovernment and people have accumulated a wealth of\r\nexperience and know-how on transition to a market\r\ndemocracy. We want to share this knowledge with\r\ncountries at an early stage of their reforms, starting from\r\nbuilding up a well-functioning border guard and finishing\r\nwith successful monetary reform. Learning how to teach\r\nand provide support is the final lesson before graduation,\r\nand this should be the goal of every reform country.\r\nAt any one time, there are 15 or 16 armed conflicts\r\nfrom around the world on the Security Council’s agenda.\r\nConflicts between and within States spread from Europe\r\nto Africa, from the Middle East to Asia. These conflicts\r\nare often driven by poor socio-economic conditions or\r\nethnic nationalism. Estonia, recognizing the primary role\r\nof the United Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, supports efforts to maintain and\r\nstrengthen the Organization’s capacity to organize and\r\neffectively conduct its peacekeeping operations. In\r\naddition, we trust that the phasing out of gratis personnel,\r\nas mandated by the General Assembly, if handled\r\nproperly, will not adversely affect the functioning of the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations.\r\nAs a contributor of personnel, Estonia is committed\r\nto continuous participation in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. We are preparing to dispatch the\r\njoint Estonian- Latvian-Lithuanian battalion known as\r\nBALTBAT for its inaugural tour of duty in the near\r\nfuture. I would like to extend our thanks to all nations\r\nwhich have supported the establishment and formation of\r\nBALTBAT.\r\nEstonia also intends to continue its involvement in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina within the United Nations\r\nInternational Police Task Force (IPTF). As a conflict\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 25 September 1998\r\nprevention measure, it welcomes and supports the enhanced\r\ncooperation of the United Nations with regional\r\norganizations or arrangements. In particular, deeper\r\ncooperation with the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) has great potential.\r\nThis year has already provided the international\r\ncommunity with a number of landmark events. Among\r\nnotable achievements were the twentieth special session,\r\non the reduction and prevention of the illicit production,\r\nsale and demand of narcotic substances, and the adoption\r\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Estonia\r\ntrusts that this fifty-third session of the General Assembly\r\nwill reinforce the momentum captured in June and July in\r\nboth New York and Rome, respectively.\r\nOn the other hand, the world community has\r\nwitnessed a number of vicious terrorist attacks. It is time\r\nfor everybody to understand a basic fact: terrorism is not\r\npolitics; it is not religion — it is murder. Estonia deplores\r\nall terrorist activities wherever they occur, whatever the\r\nform or manifestation. We sympathize with all nations\r\nthat have suffered these acts and call for even stronger\r\nsolidarity to fight against such attacks.\r\nWe also must acknowledge that even on the eve of\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, one of the major\r\naccomplishments of our Organization, the world is still\r\nhome to gross violations of human rights on all six\r\ncontinents. We therefore call for a sustained effort of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in close cooperation with regional\r\norganizations, to address this issue and to find the most\r\neffective mechanisms for early warning to identify and\r\nstop these violations.\r\nFinally, a few words concerning the United Nations\r\nreform. We support reform based on the proposals by the\r\nSecretary-General. Estonia strongly believes that the aim\r\nof this reform must be to come to grips with a changing\r\nworld as well as the principle of cost-effectiveness.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\n32\r\n"
