(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Guido de Marco, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Malta, and former President\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nMr. de Marco (Malta): I join other delegations in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are confident that your ability and\r\nexperience will successfully guide our work during this\r\nsession. I also wish to express our gratitude to your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\r\nwhose presidency was characterized by energy and drive.\r\nFreedom first and foremost. That rallying cry has\r\ninspired peoples and nations throughout this century. It\r\ngave birth to brave acts of courage during two world\r\nconflicts. It gave sustenance in the struggle for\r\ndecolonization. It gave stamina and resilience during and\r\nafter the dark days of the cold war.\r\nFreedom first and foremost. That was the solid\r\nplatform on which citizens worldwide stood their ground\r\nwhenever authoritarian regimes sought to erode democracy,\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law.\r\nFreedom first and foremost. That ideal buttressed\r\nPresident Roosevelt in his effort to give birth to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAs we strive to build a better world and struggle to\r\nconquer the uncertainties of our times, we the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations continue to cherish those four essential\r\nhuman freedoms identified by President Roosevelt in his\r\nspeech to Congress on 6 January 1941: freedom of speech\r\nand expression — everywhere in the world; freedom of\r\nevery person to worship God in his own way —\r\neverywhere in the world; freedom from want to secure for\r\nevery nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants —\r\neverywhere in the world; freedom from fear through a\r\nworldwide reduction of armaments so that no nation will\r\nbe in a position to commit an act of physical aggression\r\nagainst any neighbour — anywhere in the world.\r\nUnderlining these four freedoms, President Roosevelt\r\nstressed that they were “a definite basis for a kind of\r\nworld attainable in our own time and generation”, not a\r\n“vision of a distant millennium”.\r\nFor the past 53 sessions world leaders have gathered\r\nhere in this General Assembly to take stock of\r\nhumankind’s progress in achieving those noble aims for\r\nwhich the United Nations was founded. Each year brings\r\nwith it new unknowns, new challenges, new tragedies.\r\nYet each year we also see movement, in small steps or in\r\nstrides, towards a more secure world.\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nBuilding a world where peace, justice and freedom\r\nreign supreme is a duty for all of us who serve in public\r\noffice. This responsibility becomes more onerous as we\r\nadvance towards the dawning of the new millennium.\r\nEight years ago I was privileged to serve this\r\nAssembly as its President. The future then beckoned. In\r\n1989 the world had witnessed the collapse of the Soviet\r\nbloc. Millions had reacquired their freedom. In 1990 the\r\nidyllic aftermath of the Bush-Gorbachev Malta summit was\r\nshattered by the invasion of Kuwait. In those times of\r\neuphoric uncertainty I called on Member States to revitalize\r\nthis General Assembly and ensure a symbiotic relationship\r\nbetween the Organization’s principal organs. The call for\r\nreform prevailed. It bore fruit and continues to give results.\r\nReform is essential for the Organization’s well-being.\r\nIt is even more essential for the future of humankind.\r\nEight years ago I signalled the danger of a curtain of\r\npoverty dividing the world, with the same dire\r\nconsequences as the Iron Curtain had on world peace and\r\nsecurity. That danger remains and has become more\r\npronounced.\r\nLast week the President of the United States reminded\r\nthis Assembly that “the gulf is widening between the\r\nworld’s haves and have-nots”. (A/53/PV.7, p. 11)\r\nNarrowing that gulf is essential if we desire a secure global\r\nsociety bereft of rage. That rage often transforms itself into\r\nacts of violence.\r\nThe ill winds that blow at present, devastating the\r\neconomies of many States and crippling progress built\r\nthrough the hard work of so any families around the world,\r\nfurther aggravate this situation.\r\nThe United Nations is the unique instrument to\r\npromote and protect the universal enjoyment of human\r\ndignity. Significantly, one of the first tasks that this\r\nOrganization set itself was the drafting of a Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. In commemorating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of its adoption by this Assembly, we\r\nrenew our commitment to its content. That document is not\r\noutdated, nor can it be easily replaced. It proclaims human\r\nrights that by their very nature are universal, inherent and\r\nindivisible.\r\nThe Declaration is comprehensive and demands an\r\nobservance that is equally comprehensive. A selective\r\napproach damages the Declaration and the wider concepts\r\nthat it represents. It undermines a vision of society in\r\nwhich respect for human rights is paramount and universal.\r\nThere is, however, a significant lack in this\r\nDeclaration. It is an instrument with no judicial\r\nmechanisms or sanctions. Has the time arrived to learn\r\nfrom the experience of the regional human rights\r\nconventions, in particular the European Convention,\r\nwhich through its mechanisms instituted the European\r\nCourt of Human Rights and through the right of\r\nindividual petition further guarantees a judicial process\r\naimed at ensuring effective enforcement?\r\nThere can be no freedom without democracy.\r\nEqually, there can be no democracy without the exercise\r\nof individual freedoms. We underscore this reaffirmation\r\nas we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nWe the peoples look up to United Nations for\r\nleadership in resolving the ills of our times. Yet we the\r\npeoples are the United Nations. The United Nations is us.\r\nAttempts to project or depict the United Nations as\r\nan entity alien to the rest of the international community\r\nor as an Organization that can determine or predetermine\r\nthe fate of peoples and society are both erroneous and\r\ndangerous. This Organization depends on a continuation\r\nof that balance of principles and institutions intrinsic in\r\nthe Charter. This balance is best conserved by\r\nconsolidating the process of consensus-building that has\r\nrendered so many positive results in the past half-century.\r\nImposition of the will of some over the will of the others\r\nis rarely conducive to harmony in any circumstance. It is\r\neven less so in a forum of sovereign nation States.\r\nThere are instances when the will of the majority\r\ntraces important paths for future cooperation between\r\nStates. Yet the effort to ensure the widest a priori\r\nadherence to the principles being negotiated is always\r\nessential, particularly if we desire such agreements to be\r\nuniversal in their application. This demands a diplomatic\r\nand political effort that may appear exasperating. Still, it\r\nis the path that best conserves the delicate balance\r\nbetween the sovereign rights of States and the emergence\r\nof a new world order.\r\nWe have partaken of the sorrow sown by violence\r\nand war. We have survived the tensions of bloc\r\nantagonism and nuclear proliferation. We have grappled\r\nwith the anguish of division and mutual suspicion. The\r\nimminence of a new millennium naturally generates hopes\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nand expectations. Foremost is the longing for the fulfilment\r\nof the promise garnered at the end of the cold war.\r\nThroughout this decade we committed ourselves, devising\r\ntools to deal with uncertainties as they emerged. Yet\r\nsuffering and strife continue to plague the planet.\r\nShocking violations imposed upon us the duty to\r\nprovide future generations with an international judicial\r\nmechanism to fairly establish the guilt of the perpetrators of\r\nwar crimes and provide for their punishment. We acted\r\nwith the swiftness demanded by the might of right. We set\r\nthe framework to deal with crimes that are an affront to\r\nhumanity’s sense of justice and compassion.\r\nIn Rome last July we adopted the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. We thus lay the foundation\r\nfor an effective and credible institution that in itself is a\r\ndeterrent against the commission of heinous crimes falling\r\nunder its jurisdiction. We hope that the momentum gathered\r\nin institution-building is retained to enable the Court to start\r\nfunctioning and effectively deal with crimes against\r\nhumanity whenever they occur.\r\nVigilance remains the order of the day. With good\r\nreason, the world proclaimed victory at the indefinite\r\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT). The ratification of the latter by two of the\r\nnuclear-weapon States is a welcome and positive step. Yet\r\npitted against these positive developments were recent\r\nnuclear tests carried out by two non-signatories. We have\r\nseen the partial dismantling of nuclear arsenals, but also\r\nwitnessed the dangers of proliferation. Such actions fuel\r\ninsecurity and mistrust. We join others in strongly urging\r\nthese two countries, and indeed all countries, to exercise\r\nrestraint. Nuclear testing is a stark reminder of the dangers\r\never present in nuclear weaponry.\r\nMalta welcomes the statements of intent made by the\r\nPrime Ministers of India and Pakistan in this Assembly last\r\nweek. They augur well for the universality of the NPT\r\nregime. No effort must be spared to ensure universal\r\nadherence to and compliance with the relevant treaties\r\ncovering not only nuclear weapons but also all weapons of\r\nmass destruction. The nuclear disarmament agenda must be\r\nkept on track. The dangers that loom are not limited to the\r\npossession and use of such armaments by nuclear-weapon\r\nStates. The spectre of nuclear terrorism haunts us as we\r\ncombat illegal trafficking related to the possession,\r\nproduction and use of such weapons.\r\nThe dangers remain multiple. Chemical and\r\nbiological weapons pose destabilizing threats. By\r\ndisturbing contrast, technologies for their acquisition and\r\nuse are relatively easy to develop. Conventional arms-\r\ntrafficking also remains a major menace.\r\nThe establishment of the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) sets out a\r\nregime of control and verification that strikes a balance,\r\ncurbing proliferation of chemicals for weapons use while\r\nsanctioning beneficial use of chemicals by a wide range\r\nof industries. Malta is proud to have served on the\r\nExecutive Council in its initial stage.\r\nIt is our hope that the verification protocol on\r\nbiological weapons may likewise hamper, discourage and\r\ndisallow the use of biological components for war,\r\nconflict or conquest. Images of the maimed victims of\r\nlandmines buttress our commitment to outlaw these\r\nweapons. Malta was among the first to sign the Ottawa\r\nConvention, and ratification is being processed. We join\r\nothers in saluting its entry into force early next year. This\r\nbrings closer the prohibition on the use, stockpiling,\r\nproduction and transfer of anti-personnel mines and their\r\ndestruction.\r\nEqually threatening, intrusive and destabilizing are\r\ninternational crime, drug-trafficking and terrorism. These\r\ncontinue to poison the very roots of our societies,\r\nspreading corruption, fear and suffering. No Government\r\ncan ignore or shield itself from such phenomena.\r\nComplacency is both dangerous and unreal. United\r\nNations efforts to further international cooperation to\r\ncombat and curb these afflictions, particularly those of the\r\nVienna Centre for International Crime Prevention, deserve\r\nour full and unwavering support.\r\nFreedom, democracy and social justice have\r\nfortunately become oft-used terms within this\r\nOrganization. They are indeed the basic elements of all\r\nour efforts. They reflect the will to give substance to the\r\nCharter’s reaffirmation of fundamental human rights, the\r\ndignity and worth of the human person, and the equal\r\nrights of men and women and of nations large and small.\r\nCommitment to human rights must be matched by\r\naction to promote social justice and better living standards\r\nin larger freedom. The human rights that we promote and\r\nprotect must be complemented by the provision of a\r\nsocial safety net that preserves the dignity of all. This is\r\na principle that the Maltese people hold dear.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nMy Government was again returned to office less than\r\nthree weeks ago. The cornerstone of our agenda is the\r\nrestoration of confidence and direction and the generation\r\nof wealth, to the benefit of all our people: our only and\r\nmost precious resource. This demands the resumption of a\r\nstrategy that invests in improving health and education\r\nservices with the same vigour with which we revolutionized\r\nthe social and economic infrastructures of our country. We\r\nare committed to social justice and thus to the well-being\r\nof those most vulnerable to suffering if left to their own\r\ndevices in times of economic transition. The true measure\r\nof progress remains social justice that buttresses equity and\r\npersonal dignity and ensures the universal enjoyment of\r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms.\r\nThe change in Administration has also brought about\r\nthe resumption of the march towards Europe which was\r\nbriefly frozen during the previous 22 months by the\r\nprevious Administration. Malta’s application for\r\nmembership of the European Union has been reactivated.\r\nAn overwhelming electoral mandate reconfirms the\r\nEuropean vocation of our people, repeatedly expressed in\r\nfree and fair elections during the past two decades. The\r\nchoice of our people is clear, and the path we shall follow\r\nis equally clear. Our immediate objective is to rejoin those\r\ncountries earmarked for the next enlargement of the Union.\r\nThough much remains to be done, the commitment of the\r\npeople and the Government is deep-seated.\r\nWe do not choose to be European. We are European:\r\nEuropean in history and culture, in economic structures and\r\npolitical organization, in security concerns and ethical\r\nvalues. Anchorage in the European Union is the natural\r\nculmination of our development process, our traditions and\r\nour culture. As in any other member of the Union, debate\r\non the benefits of membership and the consequent rights\r\nand responsibilities continues. This is an intrinsic aspect of\r\nthe democratic process. Nowhere in Europe have choices\r\nbeen easy or straightforward, but everywhere in Europe, the\r\nfreely expressed will of the people has prevailed. This is a\r\nfundamental characteristic of Europe, a political union built\r\non respect for the individual and the democratic will of its\r\npeoples.\r\nEnlargement of the European Union to gather peoples\r\nand nations within its fold in a spirit of pluralism, solidarity\r\nand cooperation is more than just a process. It cannot be\r\nseen as just an exercise in augmenting the membership. It\r\nis much more than that. It is a political demand for the\r\nrealization of the Union and its credibility in global politics.\r\nCharacterized by reciprocity, it is a quest in peace-building,\r\na venture that in less than half a century has continued to\r\ntransform the founding fathers’ ideal into a tangible\r\nreality.\r\nLike all other Mediterranean States, Malta views the\r\nproblems of its region with particular concern. At the\r\ncrossroads of cultures and civilizations, the Mediterranean\r\nis disproportionately burdened with turmoil, tension and\r\nconflict. Resolution of each crisis demands positive action\r\nby the protagonists directly responsible. Yet the world\r\ncommunity can contribute, through its efforts and good\r\noffices, to constructing an environment conducive to\r\nnegotiated settlement. The bitter heritage of the past\r\nsometimes impedes that contact which is an essential first\r\nstep in the setting up of negotiating structures. In this\r\neffort to overcome obstacles, the international community\r\nand individual statesmen have given their fair share.\r\nThe open wounds that still afflict the region demand\r\nrenewed engagement lest they continue to fester and\r\ndegenerate into volatility that would risk spilling over to\r\nbroader areas.\r\nThe Cyprus question has long been one of these\r\nopen wounds, having political and stability repercussions\r\nthat go beyond the geographic dimensions of the island\r\nitself. A solution in conformity with the resolutions of the\r\nUnited Nations can have enduring positive effects for all\r\nthe parties concerned in the dispute.\r\nThe ever pervasive problems encountered by the\r\nMiddle East process are of particular concern. In spite of\r\nvarious efforts, this process has come to a virtual\r\nstandstill. We believe in the importance of revitalizing\r\nand respecting the commitments undertaken through and\r\nafter the Oslo peace accords. We urge all sides to respond\r\npositively to current initiatives aimed at restoring dialogue\r\nand hope.\r\nThe new millennium is the commemoration of the\r\nbirth of Jesus Christ, when the message that was brought\r\nto us was “peace on Earth”. This is precisely the message\r\nthat is central to the initiative that will be debated during\r\nthis session, Bethlehem 2000. How sad it will be if the\r\nland of the nativity is still at war 2,000 years after that\r\nmessage.\r\nThe Euro-Mediterranean process was a significant\r\nstep in bringing together European and Mediterranean\r\ncountries comprehensively to address issues that still\r\nbeleaguer the region. The impasse in the Middle East has\r\ndealt a blow to the Euro-Mediterranean process. One\r\nhopes that this is but a temporary setback. Stability in the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nMediterranean must rest on multiple initiatives that nurture\r\ncooperation through gradual confidence- and security-\r\nbuilding measures. This is the crux of our insistence on the\r\nneed to establish a stability pact for the region. Initiatives\r\nsuch as the addition of a parliamentary dimension to this\r\nprocess of dialogue, promoted by the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion, the setting up of a council or forum of\r\nMediterranean States and the eventual creation of a\r\nconference on security and cooperation in the\r\nMediterranean deserve serious consideration.\r\nRegional approaches complement and reinforce efforts\r\nat the international level. In 1992, at the Helsinki follow-up\r\nmeeting of the then Conference on Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), Malta proposed that the\r\nCSCE should declare itself a regional arrangement by the\r\nterms of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. We\r\nnote with satisfaction that relations between what is now\r\nknown as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) and the United Nations continue to be\r\nstrengthened. Apart from institutional benefits reaped\r\nthrough regular contact between the two organizations, what\r\nis more relevant is the increased cooperation on the ground\r\nin the various parts of the OSCE area.\r\nEver since Dipoli, the site of the first preparatory\r\nphase, Malta has contributed to the evolution of the OSCE\r\nprocess. It has promoted the Mediterranean dimension of\r\nthis process. Mediterranean and European security remain\r\nintimately and reciprocally linked. Strengthening of security\r\nand cooperation in the Mediterranean is an important\r\nelement for stability in the OSCE region. Consistent\r\nengagement by successive Malta Governments has\r\ncontributed towards the greater involvement of the\r\nMediterranean Partners for Cooperation in the work of the\r\nOSCE. We will continue to work to further this\r\nrelationship.\r\nThe regional approach has reinforced cooperation\r\nthrough the interlocking of different and distinct European\r\nand international organizations. In this respect. Malta pays\r\nhomage to the role of the Council of Europe in protecting\r\nand promoting dignity, human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms and in nurturing the principles of human\r\nsolidarity.\r\nWe are particularly heartened by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s stated intention to consolidate the partnership\r\nbetween regional organizations and the United Nations\r\nthrough a more structured, rational and cost-effective\r\ndivision of labour.\r\nDistinct from other organizations, the\r\nCommonwealth also continues to advance avenues of\r\ncooperation. Cross-regional projects among countries\r\nsteeped in a common tradition continue to unfold. Malta\r\nupholds this international effort through its participation\r\nin various programmes that promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nDifferent scenarios face this Organization. We have\r\nlearnt that negotiating agreements is not enough.\r\nUniversality remains a priority as we develop the tools to\r\ndeal with emerging problems. Reform of this\r\nOrganization is another priority. Many of its structures\r\nmust better their effectiveness. Reform is not an end in\r\nitself — it is an ongoing process that necessarily requires\r\nperiodic review. We must remain open to the challenge of\r\nchange by being innovative and adaptive, seeking to\r\nreorient structures established in a different time, without\r\nbetraying the core principles that remain ever valid.\r\nMalta has steadfastly fostered awareness of the need\r\nto revitalize the General Assembly. With its universal,\r\ndemocratic character, this Assembly is the ultimate\r\nexpression of the principle of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates. Yet, conditioned by the past, the Assembly has not\r\nfully realized its potential. As the international consensus-\r\nbuilding forum, its role can be further strengthened, thus\r\nenhancing its authority.\r\nProgress has been registered in deliberations on\r\nSecurity Council reform, but consensus still evades us.\r\nThe question of which categories of membership to\r\nexpand dominates the discussion and attracts attention.\r\nHowever, other important issues, such as the transparency\r\nand openness of the Council, continue to develop. Malta\r\nattaches great importance to this aspect, which benefits\r\nthe widest majority of States.\r\nSecurity Council decisions legally bind all Member\r\nStates. Thus, procedures enhancing consultations between\r\nCouncil and Assembly members are of immense value.\r\nImproved methods introduced in recent years, while\r\nnurturing the symbiotic relationship that should bond\r\nCouncil and Assembly, prove that conferring does not\r\nhinder the Council’s ability to intervene with the required\r\nswiftness.\r\nIn seeking solutions, even on what type of expansion\r\nthe Security Council should undergo, the need for general\r\nagreement must be underscored. General agreement is not\r\nto be seen in quantitative terms; rather, it should be\r\nviewed as a guarantee that solutions have the political\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nsupport to come to fruition. Agreement on this sensitive\r\nissue must be comprehensive if it is to stand the test of\r\ntime. Lack of consensus on expanding the permanent\r\nmember category should not impede further progress.\r\nWe support the fallback position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement to limit enlargement to the non-permanent\r\ncategory for the time being. This will allow the process to\r\nmove forward without prejudice to an eventual continuation\r\nof deliberations on permanent category expansion.\r\nThe environment has been the focus of uninterrupted\r\nattention since the end of the cold war. The ushering in of\r\na new era of cooperation has enabled the international\r\ncommunity to address different areas requiring concerted\r\naction. An unprecedented number of treaties and\r\nconventions have been negotiated. Treaty bodies and\r\ninstitutions now function effectively, addressing distinct but\r\nrelated areas of concern.\r\nIn this new international milieu, the Charter’s broader\r\nnotion of trusteeship assumes renewed relevance. During\r\nmy presidency of this Assembly, the Trusteeship Council\r\nwas about to discharge its responsibility for the last of the\r\nterritories placed under its custody. Some suggested\r\nfreezing or dismantling the Council. I proposed that the\r\nTrusteeship Council be given additional responsibility in\r\ncoordinating international endeavours that safeguard\r\ndifferent areas of the common heritage of humankind.\r\nSince then, many others have proclaimed themselves\r\nfavourable to this type of reform. The identification of new\r\nadditional responsibilities for the Trusteeship Council forms\r\npart of the reform package proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral last year.\r\nWe have also taken note of the recommendations of\r\nthe United Nations Task Force on Environment and Human\r\nSettlements in its report to the Secretary-General earlier this\r\nyear. The positive openness to this proposal is encouraging.\r\nMalta intends to participate actively in the recommended\r\nconsultations to be undertaken by the Executive Director of\r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in\r\npreparing for the next regular session of the Governing\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe application of the principles of trust and common\r\nresponsibility in a number of international conventions\r\nmakes their coordination the natural task of the Trusteeship\r\nCouncil. The principle of trust should retain its rightful\r\nplace in the institutional framework of this Organization.\r\nThe International Year of the Ocean is in its final\r\nquarter. Many feel that a forum is needed to consider the\r\nclosely interrelated problems of ocean space as a whole.\r\nThe Independent World Commission for the Oceans, on\r\nwhich I have the honour to serve, has vigorously\r\naddressed this vital issue. Malta suggests positive\r\nconsideration of the suggestion that this Assembly\r\ninstitute a biennial committee of the whole to review\r\nocean-related questions in an integrated manner.\r\nNotwithstanding our collective endeavours, peace\r\nremains daily threatened in different parts of the world.\r\nUnited Nations deliberations in response to such threats\r\nrightfully enjoy a high profile with the public and in the\r\nmedia. In most instances, the success of these\r\ndeliberations rests on the sheer dedication of the United\r\nNations officials in conflict zones and particularly on the\r\ncourageous sacrifice of troops forming part of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations.\r\nThis year, we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof United Nations peacekeeping operations. Peacekeepers\r\nhave faced risks, humiliation, threat and death. This\r\nnotwithstanding, they have never faltered in their duty or\r\ndetermination to bring hope where despair often prevails.\r\nDespite increasing risks, the United Nations has not\r\nshirked its responsibilities. Indeed, it has broadened its\r\npeacekeeping mandates. I had the opportunity to\r\npersonally bring this Assembly’s message of solidarity\r\nand support to peacekeepers serving in different parts of\r\nthe world. During the past five decades, the number of\r\npeacekeepers who have paid the supreme sacrifice has\r\ncontinued to grow. We salute and pay tribute to their\r\nmemory.\r\nLike others who have addressed this Assembly\r\nbefore me, I have outlined some challenges facing our\r\nOrganization. New problems continue to emerge,\r\npresenting us with daunting and confounding scenarios.\r\nYet, despite all the odds against it, the United Nations has\r\nwithstood the test of time. It has survived because it\r\ninvested faith in humankind and dispensed hope where\r\nmisery prevailed. It has gradually built the required tools\r\nto foster international cooperation.\r\nObstacles may continue to loom large, yet at no time\r\nin human history has the potential been so great. We must\r\nseize the opportunity provided us to act in concert. Our\r\ncommitment to the United Nations is unwavering. Our\r\ncommitment to sparing humankind from untold suffering\r\nis strong. Together, we can head into the new millennium\r\nimbued with the founding fathers’ determination to save\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. We owe\r\nthis to ourselves. We will strive to bequeath it to our\r\nchildren.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\r\nTogo, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kokou Koffigoh.\r\nMr. Koffigoh (Togo) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me first of all, on behalf of the people of Togo and\r\nPresident Eyadema and his Government, to join in the\r\ncongratulations extended to you, Sir, since the beginning of\r\nour work on your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-third session.\r\nWe would also like to congratulate his your illustrious\r\npredecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on the effective\r\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-second\r\nsession.\r\nI would furthermore like to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his colleagues for\r\ntheir continuous efforts to champion the noble ideals of\r\npeace, justice, progress and solidarity embodied by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nBy way of analysing the situation in Africa, I would\r\nlike to present Togo’s perspective of the world’s problems\r\nin the context of improved international cooperation.\r\nAfrica is democratizing, but it needs peace and\r\nsecurity if it is to succeed. Africa is the continent most\r\naffected by the great scourges of the planet, but its\r\ndevelopment is also part of a dynamic of progress. The\r\nscourges hampering its development are well known:\r\nendemic disease, drought, poverty, political instability,\r\nethnic conflicts, civil wars and regional conflicts. These\r\nscourges have a tendency to eclipse the successes.\r\nSince the signing of the Abuja Treaty in 1991, Africa\r\nhas set itself a timetable for integration in the framework of\r\nthe African Economic Community, on the basis of\r\nstrengthening regional groupings of western, northern,\r\ncentral, eastern and southern Africa. These groups are\r\nthemselves actively engaged in seeking joint solutions to\r\nthe challenges confronting its member States.\r\nThe rate of economic growth of certain African States\r\ncontinues to make progress thanks to good management\r\npolicies.\r\nA vast democratic movement has begun throughout\r\nour continent to build States based on the rule of law.\r\nThis movement is being followed up by the adoption of\r\nnew constitutions and the establishment of independent\r\nbodies to implement them. Numerous heads of State and\r\nof Government have had their mandates challenged in\r\nperiodic elections. The majority and the opposition\r\nrepresentatives of the people have seats in the new\r\nrepresentative bodies — parliaments and national\r\nassemblies. The success of the functioning of these new\r\nconstitutional bodies is ensured by independent legal\r\nbodies. The press is now free, as are labour unions in\r\nmost of our States.\r\nI am emphasizing these institutional aspects of\r\nbuilding a new Africa because the respect and support of\r\nthe international community for these institutions is a\r\nfactor in favour of peace within the particular States, and\r\ntherefore for peace in our regions.\r\nExperience has shown us that a domestic conflict, by\r\ngiving rise to an exodus of people to neighbouring\r\ncountries, also has a rapid and serious effect on the latter.\r\nI repeat, as the current situation in the Great Lakes region\r\ndemonstrates, such domestic conflicts can lead to regional\r\ncrises.\r\nTogo is among the States that voluntarily established\r\ninstitutions that safeguard the rule of law and that can\r\narbitrate disputes that may arise in the new context of\r\ndemocratization. It is in this framework that the\r\nConstitutional Court of Togo declared the results of the\r\npresidential election of 21 June 1998 after having\r\narbitrated the disputes that resulted from the election.\r\nTogo’s respect for institutions is the very foundation\r\nof democracy and peace. On behalf of my Government,\r\nI would like to invite all of our partners at the United\r\nNations to support without distinction the efforts of all the\r\ncountries of Africa that commit themselves to the difficult\r\nbut rewarding path of building a State of law. This is the\r\nprice of peace in Africa.\r\nWhile we can be gratified at the end of certain\r\nconflicts — particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone —\r\nand while solutions are in sight to relieve the tensions in\r\nGuinea-Bissau, we cannot fail to express our concern over\r\nthe crisis in the Great Lakes region, the resumption of\r\nhostilities in Angola, the continuation of the crisis in\r\nSomalia and, finally, the armed confrontation between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nWe cannot stress enough the advantages of dialogue\r\nand negotiation as the best paths to follow for settling\r\ndisputes between States on the basis of respect for their\r\nterritorial integrity.\r\nIn that connection, the international community must\r\nput an end to the embargo imposed on Libya by\r\nimplementing the jurisdictional solution accepted by that\r\ncountry and by ensuring a fair trial for the suspects in the\r\nLockerbie bombing. Togo firmly supports the efforts of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to settle this dispute\r\nand end the suffering of the Libyan people.\r\nMy country takes this opportunity to repeat its\r\nsteadfast condemnation of terrorism in all of its forms and\r\nto emphasize the need for urgent and concerted action to\r\ncombat this scourge effectively.\r\nAs we are aware, the proliferation of conflict\r\nsituations in Africa remains a real cause of concern for the\r\ninternational community. I would like to note in this regard\r\nthe important report (A/52/871) presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral last February at the request of the Security Council\r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa. That report\r\ncontains specific recommendations on means of preventing\r\nsuch conflicts and putting an end to them, as well as on\r\nmeasures to be taken to create conditions for lasting peace\r\nand economic growth. We hope that the implementation of\r\nhis recommendations by the Security Council, by the\r\nrelevant bodies of the United Nations system and by the\r\nBretton Woods institutions will result in the effective\r\nprevention of conflicts and put Africa on the road to\r\nprogress, stability and sustainable development.\r\nElsewhere in the world, we were relieved to see the\r\nsigning of an agreement between the Government of Iraq\r\nand the United Nations, which made it possible at the last\r\nmoment to avoid a new confrontation in the Gulf.\r\nIn the same region, my Government deplores the\r\npresent deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\r\nWe remain convinced that only the resumption of direct\r\nnegotiations between the principals will make it possible to\r\nusher in an era of peace, security and prosperity in that\r\nregion. We were relieved to see the contacts that have taken\r\nplace between Mr. Yasser Arafat and Mr. Benjamin\r\nNetanyahu through the mediation of the American\r\nGovernment. Togo strongly supports this initiative.\r\nWith regard to the other crises that assail the world\r\nand jeopardize the lives of so many millions of people —\r\nparticularly in Afghanistan and Kosovo — my country\r\nhopes that through firm political will backed by candid\r\nand sincere negotiations, the parties to the conflicts will\r\nfind appropriate solutions that are acceptable to all.\r\nThe world’s concerns at the dawn of the third\r\nmillennium are not linked solely to the effects of the\r\nphenomenon of globalization. The preservation of peace,\r\nsecurity and stability for States and peoples continues to\r\nbe an important priority. In that context, Togo is gratified\r\nto note that the United Nations is continuing to discharge\r\nits mission of peacemaking and peacekeeping. In this\r\nregard, I welcome the upcoming commemoration on 6\r\nOctober of 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations, and I would like to pay tribute to the memory\r\nof all the men and women who have given their lives in\r\nthe service of the Organization.\r\nMy country, which firmly supports the ongoing quest\r\nfor peace and security for all, would like to emphasize the\r\nneed to strengthen cooperation in this area, in a spirit of\r\ncomplementarity, between the United Nations and\r\nsubregional and regional organizations, in accordance with\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. The\r\nappropriate regional machinery necessary to give concrete\r\nform to this shared desire for collective maintenance of\r\npeace and security should be established.\r\nIt is in that spirit that Togo — together with other\r\ncountries of the West African subregion and in the\r\nframework of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) — is working to establish a viable and\r\npermanent mechanism for the prevention, management\r\nand settlement of conflicts and the maintenance of peace.\r\nIt is also within this framework that we welcome the\r\nfourth extraordinary summit of ECOWAS, held in Lomé\r\nfrom 16 to 17 December 1997, and the holding of the\r\njoint military manoeuvres named “Cohesion Kompienga\r\n’98”, held from 16 to 21 April 1998, in which the armed\r\nforces of Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, the\r\nNiger, Nigeria, Chad and Togo participated.\r\nAmong the goals of the United Nations are vigilance\r\nover the maintenance of peace and security, the\r\nestablishment of conditions for harmonious economic\r\ndevelopment to ensure the well-being of our populations\r\nand working for a just world in which the rights of\r\nindividuals and peoples are not only recognized and\r\nconsecrated, but above all respected.\r\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to\r\nhail the holding of the United Nation Diplomatic\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nConference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an\r\nInternational Criminal Court, which led to the adoption of\r\nthe Statute of the court which was held in Rome from\r\n15 June to 17 July.\r\nTogo believes that peace is impossible without justice.\r\nThe struggle for peace and the struggle for greater justice\r\nmust be viewed as two complementary aspects of one and\r\nthe same struggle for the realization of the deepest\r\naspirations of all the peoples of the world. The positive\r\noutcome of the negotiations at the Conference resulted in\r\nthe adoption of the Statute of the court, illustrating anew\r\nthe vigour and ability of our Organization in dealing with\r\nthe present and preparing States to face the issues of\r\ntomorrow.\r\nIt is for that reason that my delegation favours all\r\nefforts to reform the Organization that aim to make it more\r\neffective, more concerned with the problems of mankind\r\nand more democratic, so that the views of all are better\r\nreflected and taken into account in all of its bodies.\r\nTogo would therefore like to see the rapid conclusion\r\nof discussions to allow for the permanent representation of\r\nAfrica in the Security Council, in accordance with the\r\nresolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nThe democracy we are advocating at the national level must\r\nalso be reflected in international organizations.\r\nThe United Nations has always played an important\r\nrole in the advancement of economic and social\r\ndevelopment and, when necessary, in providing the men,\r\nwomen and children of the entire world with the assistance\r\non which their survival often depends. We are nevertheless\r\nobliged to recognize that despite the efforts made, the\r\nimprovement of standards of living, full employment and\r\nthe conditions for progress and economic and social\r\ndevelopment have not been realized. This is particularly the\r\ncase in Africa, where continued inequality and poverty,\r\namong other things, dangerously imperil the stability of\r\nStates.\r\nIt is true that African economies have performed\r\nremarkably well in the last three years; but it is also true\r\nthat the consolidation of these gains still depends on the\r\ninternational economic environment. Global economic\r\nstructural constraints — including the continuing burden of\r\ndebt, the reduction in the flow of official development\r\nassistance, currency fluctuations, the inequality of\r\ninvestment flows, weak commodity prices and market\r\nprotectionism practised by developed countries — still\r\nremain the major obstacles to the economic development\r\nof African countries.\r\nWith regard to the debt burden in particular, my\r\ncountry highly values the declaration of the eighth\r\nconsultative meeting of the Organization of African Unity,\r\nthe African Development Bank and the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa, which was held in Abidjan in\r\nJanuary 1998. We believe that the efforts to alleviate the\r\ndebt burden must be continued in conjunction with\r\nAfrica’s partners in order to find appropriate solutions to\r\nthis thorny problem.\r\nIn this context, Togo would like to reaffirm the\r\nimperative need to hold an international conference on\r\nAfrica’s foreign debt, and it requests the support of the\r\ninternational community to translate that proposal into\r\nreality.\r\nRegrettably, at this time of economic globalization,\r\nthe marginalization of Africa in terms of international\r\ntrade is accelerating, even though today the development\r\nof trade appears to be the most effective means of\r\nmanaging the resources necessary for self-sufficiency.\r\nIndeed, the development and economic growth of African\r\nStates requires as a basic condition sufficient currency\r\ninflows from the export of their commodities. Thus, in the\r\nview of my delegation, an open world system operating\r\nunder just and equitable regulations should be established\r\nin order to ensure the active participation of African\r\nStates in international trade. To that end, more liberal\r\nmeasures will be required in order to promote the\r\ntransformation and diversification of their products as\r\nwell as to attract and channel investments towards them.\r\nThe industrialized countries are attempting to join\r\nforces. This shows clearly that today no country,\r\nregardless of how powerful it is, can alone provide for its\r\nown economic growth and cope with increasingly\r\naggressive international competition. Given this state of\r\naffairs, the African countries have in recent years\r\nreaffirmed their will to pool their potential by establishing\r\nand strengthening subregional units. It is clear that the\r\ndevelopment policy of our countries must be considered\r\nwithin this framework, for this is the only way that Africa\r\ncan become a fully fledged and reliable partner in the\r\nworld of the twenty-first century.\r\nIn this respect, the entry into force of the Treaty\r\nestablishing the African Economic Community serves as\r\na good illustration of the will of African States to unite\r\ntheir efforts to ensure their own progress.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nTogo, which is firmly committed to the policy of\r\neconomic integration of the continent, wishes to take this\r\nopportunity to once again urge the international community\r\nto support the efforts of the African countries to achieve the\r\ngoals of sustainable development which alone can promote\r\nprosperity and the well-being of their peoples.\r\nI should like here to underscore an emerging trend in\r\nAfrica: inter-African parliamentary control of the activities\r\nof our regional and subregional organizations. It is in this\r\nframework that an inter-parliamentary committee of the\r\nWest African Economic and Monetary Union was created\r\nrecently in Bamako; its work is already under way. Also in\r\nthis framework, a parliamentary assembly was established\r\nin the countries of the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC), in southern Africa. This shows that\r\nwhile, generally speaking, people tend to despair of the\r\nfuture of Africa, we young Africans have faith that Africa\r\nis on the right path as long as we have the unswerving\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nHere I should like once again to welcome the\r\ncommitment of the Japanese Government to Africa through\r\nthe Tokyo Conference on the Development of Africa\r\n(TICAD), aimed at seeking solutions to the continent’s\r\ndevelopment problems. My delegation would like here once\r\nagain to thank the Japanese Government for all of its\r\nefforts to strengthen cooperation between Africa and Asia,\r\nand congratulates it on the convening of TICAD II next\r\nOctober in Tokyo.\r\nMoreover, Togo believes that the combination of\r\nTICAD with other initiatives — in particular that of the\r\nUnited States on equitable partnership, known as 20/20\r\nVision; that of the European Union, within the framework\r\nof the Lomé Convention; and that of the francophone\r\nworld, within the framework of the Hanoi Plan of\r\nAction — will help safeguard and consolidate the spirit of\r\nsolidarity, which Africa wishes to see ever more active and\r\never more purposeful.\r\nMy country is convinced of the need for solidarity\r\namong the Members of our Organization and is deeply\r\ncommitted to the noble ideals of peace, freedom and justice\r\nand of economic, social and cultural progress, which the\r\nUnited Nations has contributed to advancing. During this\r\nyear of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights, Togo fervently hopes to witness the\r\nrealization, for the benefit of all humankind, of the\r\nprofound aspirations of peoples to greater freedom and to\r\na world of peace in which the struggle against poverty,\r\nfamine and illness grows is daily strengthened.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Mr. Farouk Al-Shara, on whom I\r\nnow call.\r\nMr. Al-Shara (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): I have the pleasure of congratulating you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that\r\nyour wide-ranging expertise in international affairs will\r\nfacilitate your task and lead the deliberations of this\r\nsession to a successful conclusion. I should like also to\r\nthank your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his\r\nwise leadership and invaluable contributions during the\r\npreceding session of the Assembly. Nor can I fail to\r\nexpress our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\r\nefforts he is exerting to enhance the role of the United\r\nNations in international affairs.\r\nFollowing the end of the cold war a decade ago,\r\nmany, especially in the countries of the North, believed\r\nthat this planet, which is home to approximately 6 billion\r\npeople, was going to become a more stable, secure and\r\nprosperous world. That conviction proceeded from the\r\nnotion that the bi-polar system was unable to achieve\r\ninternational security except in the framework of a\r\nbalance of terror. Nor was the old system able to resolve\r\nregional conflicts due to competition for areas of\r\ninfluence.\r\nThe question now before the international\r\ncommunity is the following: were these convictions\r\njustified? Or did wishful thinking leapfrog reality,\r\nignoring the following salient facts?\r\nFirst, nuclear weapons, which are unparalleled in\r\ntheir destructive capability, have proliferated since the end\r\nof the cold war and have now reached India and Pakistan.\r\nThis proliferation has also gained a sort of legitimacy\r\nbased on the fact that Israel’s possession of nuclear\r\nweapons was not spoken of during the 1995 Review and\r\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. My country,\r\nSyria, Arab countries and most countries in the Non-\r\nAligned Movement appealed to the five nuclear-weapon\r\nStates during the review and extension conferences for\r\nthis Treaty not to exempt any country from adhering to\r\nthis Treaty, so that the world will not face a new nuclear\r\narms race. Unfortunately that urgent call fell on deaf ears.\r\nThose who now assume that nuclear-arms proliferation\r\nwill be limited to a few countries are mistaken. Syria and\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nall Arab countries call for turning the Middle East into a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone, as a serious contribution to\r\nhalting the nuclear-arms race.\r\nSecondly, in the post-cold-war era regional conflicts\r\nhave multiplied, becoming more fierce, and with varying\r\nforms and motives. This has happened to such an extent\r\nthat the United States, which is now the only super-Power\r\nin a unipolar world, and the Security Council, the body\r\nresponsible for maintaining international peace and security,\r\nare no longer able to contain these conflicts, let alone find\r\njust solutions to them. Anyone who reads the statement\r\nissued by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, issued at the\r\nbeginning of this session of the General Assembly, will\r\nhave a headache and will be severely frustrated at seeing\r\nthis world face so many regional conflicts and so many\r\ncomplicated crises without any light at the end of the\r\ntunnel.\r\nThirdly, we have the recent economic and financial\r\ncrises in the world, particularly following the collapse of\r\nfinancial markets in South-East Asia and the accompanying\r\nsharp decline in the prices of raw materials, especially oil.\r\nAll of this has proven that economic globalization is a two-\r\nedged sword and has repercussions which cannot be\r\nconfined to those countries tantalized by rapid prosperity\r\ngenerated by an inflow of capital and foreign investments.\r\nRather, such effects go beyond those countries to the\r\ncountries exporting capital and investments, which were\r\nalso tempted by quick profits without paying much heed to\r\nthe consequences.\r\nWhat is going on in the world now under the banner\r\nof globalization is a cause for concern, because it gives\r\npriority to profit over other development factors: economic,\r\nsocial, cultural and environmental. It also strives to confine\r\nthe role of the State to providing guarantees and protection\r\nto major market forces, ignoring the responsibility for the\r\nachievement of social justice for the peoples. Furthermore,\r\nthe continuing marginalization of developing countries in\r\ninternational economic decision-making and the continuing\r\nsevere restrictions on access by such countries to\r\ninternational markets and financial and technological\r\nresources render these countries unable to benefit from the\r\npromised opportunities of globalization.\r\nStrengthening development indicators and increasing\r\nlevels of productivity are the more durable means of\r\nlimiting the effects of economic crises and reducing the\r\neffects of financial upheavals, especially in developing\r\ncountries. At any rate, we believe that such crises and\r\nshake-ups may happen from time to time and may touch\r\nevery country, no matter how immune it may seem, so\r\nlong as the most powerful and prevalent monetary unit in\r\nthe world — the United States dollar — is not stable.\r\nHowever, the imminent issuance of a European monetary\r\nunit may contribute to establishing a more stable\r\ninternational financial and economic system.\r\nIn any case, we believe there is no alternative to\r\nopening a serious dialogue within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations between developing and developed\r\ncountries and international monetary institutions in order\r\nto lay a solid foundation for international cooperation\r\nwhich might save the world from economic surprises and\r\nsocial upheavals and also contribute positively to the\r\ninterests of all countries in the world, in the South as well\r\nas the North.\r\nSince its beginning, the Arab-Israeli conflict has\r\nbeen given high priority on the agenda of the international\r\ncommunity. International efforts to contain this conflict\r\nhave been unrelenting every time it has exploded, because\r\nthe Middle East, with its singular strategic position, its\r\ntremendous material and spiritual wealth and its renowned\r\ncultural heritage can be considered the most sensitive\r\nparameter for measuring the state of world peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe peace process that was launched in Madrid was\r\nseen as a new beginning to settle this conflict with the\r\nend of the cold war. The Madrid terms of reference, the\r\nAmerican assurances and the results reached constituted\r\na firm basis which cannot be ignored under any\r\ncircumstance.\r\nThe insistence of the Israeli Prime Minister on\r\npursuing a policy hostile to peace and his rejection of the\r\nrights of the Arabs to regain the occupied territories under\r\nthe pretext of security for Israel alone — at a time when\r\nIsrael’s military arsenal is considered one of the mightiest\r\nand most modern in the world — constitute a challenge\r\nnot only to the Arabs, but also to the will of the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nIt seems clear that Israel does not limit its\r\nconception of security to the Arab territories it occupies;\r\nrather it is working to establish a military alliance in the\r\nregion which will undermine the peace process and put\r\nthe region on a path fraught with dangers, tension and the\r\npotential for explosion.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nWhat the region and its peoples need is not the\r\nestablishment of alliances and axes but the establishment of\r\na just and comprehensive peace, based on the full\r\nwithdrawal of Israel from the occupied Syrian Golan to the\r\nline of 4 June 1967 and from the south of Lebanon and its\r\nwestern Bekaa, in implementation of the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. In\r\naddition, the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople must be safeguarded, including their right to self-\r\ndetermination and the establishment of their independent\r\nState on their national territory.\r\nThe peace process faces a real crisis. It has been in a\r\nstalemate on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks for over two\r\nyears. It faces erosion on the Palestinian track, as well, due\r\nto Israeli intransigence. The entire peace process is on the\r\nwane and will be so long as the Israeli Government rejects\r\nthe principle of land for peace and attempts to impose on\r\nthe Arabs a peace based on occupation and settlerism.\r\nHowever, Syria has been and continues to be committed to\r\npeace; we consider it a strategic option that requires the\r\nresumption of negotiations from the point at which they\r\nstopped on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks and that\r\ncontinues to build on the commitments and undertakings\r\nreached until a just and comprehensive peace is established\r\nin the region.\r\nSyria stresses its concern for the unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq and calls for alleviating the suffering of\r\nour brotherly Iraqi people and lifting the sanctions imposed\r\non them according to a specific timetable. In the meantime,\r\nIraq is called upon to implement the remaining Security\r\nCouncil resolutions in a way that guarantees a just\r\nresolution to the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners of war.\r\nSyria also calls for an end to the sanctions imposed on\r\nLibya, for it is our belief that it is possible to address this\r\ncrisis in an appropriate legal framework, separate from any\r\npolitical motivation. We fully support the Libyan demand\r\nfor a solution to this problem on a just basis.\r\nSyria stands against terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations; we condemn it on all fronts. We\r\ndifferentiate between terrorism and the legitimate struggle\r\nof peoples against foreign occupation and for self-\r\ndetermination and national liberation, which cannot be\r\nconsidered terrorism. We also condemn killing innocent\r\ncivilians everywhere, just as we condemn the State\r\nterrorism exercised by Israel against the Arabs.\r\nWe believe that resorting to force and violence in\r\ninternational relations, in contravention of the United\r\nNations Charter and the principles of international law,\r\ndoes not promote international legitimacy but leaves the\r\ndoor wide open to the law of the jungle. In this regard,\r\nSyria finds the United States attack on the Al-Shifa\r\npharmaceutical facility in Sudan to be unjustified. We\r\nbelieve that this attack constitutes a violation of the\r\nprinciples of international law and the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. From this perspective, Syria supports the\r\nrequest of the Sudanese Government to the Security\r\nCouncil to send a fact-finding mission to investigate the\r\nAmerican allegations relating to that installation.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nSyria follows with great concern the sharp conflicts\r\nsweeping some African countries. While expressing its\r\nsolidarity and support to the peoples of Africa, Syria calls\r\non the international community to make the necessary\r\nefforts in close cooperation with the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity to find solutions to these conflicts in a\r\nmanner that consolidates peace, stability and security on\r\nthe African continent. The international community is also\r\ncalled upon to give all types of support to enable African\r\nStates to eliminate the scourge of poverty and free\r\nthemselves of the burden of debt in order to achieve\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe are also following with great concern the\r\nsituation in the Republic of Somalia. We urge all the\r\nSomali parties to respect their undertakings and\r\nimplement the agreements reached among them. We call\r\non them to put the national interests of Somalia above all\r\nother considerations and to cooperate with Arab, African\r\nand international efforts towards the realization of\r\nnational reconciliation so as to guarantee the return of\r\nsecurity and stability for the Somali people.\r\nSyria supports the measures taken to ensure the\r\nachievement of peace and security in the Korean\r\npeninsula, and we also support the Korean people’s\r\naspirations to achieve unity.\r\nSyria stresses anew the urgent need to take all\r\nnecessary steps, as promptly as possible, to end the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial sanctions imposed by\r\nthe United States against Cuba for more than three\r\ndecades now. We second Cuba’s call for the resolution of\r\ndifferences between the two countries through dialogue,\r\non the basis of equality, mutual respect and good-\r\nneighbourly relations.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nSyria is extremely concerned about the general\r\nsituation in Afghanistan and the continuing bloodshed.\r\nSyria strongly condemns the killing of the Iranian diplomats\r\nin Mazar-i-Sharif. This was a violation of the principles of\r\ninternational law and of the tolerant values of Islam. We\r\ncall upon all parties to exercise self-restraint and to work\r\ntowards reaching a peaceful solution and national\r\nreconciliation.\r\nSyria supports the stand of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement which considers the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, its democratization and the expansion of its\r\nmembership as part and parcel of a package deal that is not\r\nsubject to a specific timetable. We emphasize the principles\r\nof equal sovereignty among States and equitable\r\ngeographical representation according to the provisions of\r\nthe Charter. Syria also believes that the exercise of the right\r\nof veto should be reduced and that its scope should be\r\nlimited.\r\nWe support the position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement concerning the concept of general agreement,\r\nspecifically that such agreement should, in conformity with\r\nthe provisions of Article 108 of the Charter, require a\r\nmajority of two thirds of Member States.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposed plan for reform was\r\na positive step to improve the Organization’s efficiency and\r\nenable it to cope with the changes required in the next\r\nstage. The Syrian delegation participated in the discussions\r\nrelevant to reforming the United Nations in the spirit of\r\ncollective responsibility of Member States to enhance the\r\nrole of this international Organization. We believe that\r\nMember States do have a major role to play in\r\nconsultations concerning the reforms and in the resulting\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights is an important occasion for re-\r\nemphasizing the fact that all human rights are universal and\r\ninterrelated and that the international community should\r\naddress human rights in a just and comprehensive manner,\r\nfree of double standards and manipulations for political\r\npurposes or to interfere in the internal affairs of States, and\r\ntaking into account the national characteristics and the\r\nhistorical, cultural and religious elements of each people\r\nand nation.\r\nHumankind continues to aspire to a world free of\r\nwars, poverty, ignorance and injustice, a world in which\r\njustice, security, stability and sustainable development\r\nprevail. Peoples of the world have pinned their hopes on\r\nthe United Nations Charter, which specifies among its\r\npurposes the importance of maintaining world peace and\r\nsecurity, developing relations among nations based on\r\nrespect for equality and self-determination of peoples,\r\nachieving international cooperation in the economic,\r\nsocial and cultural fields and enhancing basic freedoms\r\nfor mankind everywhere.\r\nLet us work together seriously and confidently on\r\nthe basis of these principles and objectives. Let us not\r\ndisappoint future generations. This is not an easy task, but\r\nit is certainly a noble one, which deserves our efforts,\r\nsacrifice, patience and wisdom.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Azerbaijan, His Excellency Mr. Tofik\r\nZulfugarov.\r\nMr. Zulfugarov (Azerbaijan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me first of all to sincerely congratulate\r\nthe President on his unanimous election to the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, and to\r\nexpress confidence that under his efficient leadership the\r\nAssembly will cope successfully with the complex issues\r\nbefore it.\r\nI would like to express our special gratitude to\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, whose vast experience and great\r\nprofessionalism greatly contributed to the success of the\r\nprevious session, and whose work as President during the\r\nfifty-second session epitomized the United Nations\r\ncommitment to the process of transformation aimed at\r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the Organization.\r\nAll aspects of life in Azerbaijan are covered by the\r\nprocess of radical reform directed at creating a\r\ndemocratic, secular society governed by the rule of law\r\nand based on a market economy. In spite of the current\r\nobjective difficulties caused by the consequences of\r\narmed conflict and the problems inherent in the\r\ntransitional period, Azerbaijan does not see any alternative\r\nto the course of democratic transformation it has taken,\r\nand considers the strengthening of its democratic\r\ninstitutions a priority of its State policy.\r\nRespect for fundamental political and civil rights and\r\nfreedoms, the functioning of the multi-party system, the\r\nprotection of the interests of each citizen in our society\r\nirrespective of ethnic origin, independence of the\r\njudiciary, as well as the advancement of other elements of\r\ndemocratic society, are guaranteed by the Constitution of\r\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan, which was adopted on 12\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nNovember 1995 in a national referendum. A great deal has\r\nbeen done to bring the legislative system of the country in\r\nline with relevant international standards.\r\nPresidential elections that are to take place in\r\nAzerbaijan on 11 October this year will constitute a\r\nmilestone in the process of further strengthening the\r\ndemocratic foundation of the society. Actions already\r\nundertaken by the leadership of the country have laid the\r\nfoundation for genuinely free and just elections. A new law\r\non presidential elections in the Republic of Azerbaijan was\r\nthoroughly examined by the Office for Democratic\r\nInstitutions and Human Rights of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the\r\nCouncil of Europe and meets the most rigorous\r\ninternational standards in this field.\r\nThe election process will be observed by 300\r\ninternational monitors from the OSCE, the Council of\r\nEurope and other international organizations, as well as\r\nfrom institutions of individual countries, such as the\r\nNational Democratic Institute for International Affairs in\r\nthe United States. The widest possible participation of\r\nnational monitors has been provided for. The leadership of\r\nthe country has declared its commitment to conducting free\r\nand just elections, considering it a significant event in the\r\nhistory of the Azerbaijan State.\r\nPositive developments resulting from current reforms\r\ncan also be observed in the country’s economy. At the\r\ninitial stage of its formation the young Azerbaijan State\r\nfaced internal instability, lack of a progressive legislative\r\nbasis for the market economy, disintegration of traditional\r\neconomic and trade relations, economic recession and a\r\nhuge budget deficit. These elements have created serious\r\nobstacles to economic development. Armed aggression by\r\nneighbouring Armenia has had the most negative impact on\r\nthe situation in Azerbaijan. It has resulted in the occupation\r\nof one fifth of its territory, the emergence of about 1\r\nmillion refugees and internally displaced persons and the\r\ncontinuance of the 10-year-old blockade of the Nakhichevan\r\nregion of Azerbaijan by Armenia.\r\nThe course of building a democratic society based on\r\na market economy, taken by the leadership of the country,\r\nhas created the prerequisites for drastic economic reforms.\r\nSince 1995, the Government of Azerbaijan has been\r\nimplementing a comprehensive programme of economic\r\nstabilization. Fiscal, monetary and credit policies have been\r\nstreamlined and structural reforms to liberalize the economy\r\nhave been completed. We have achieved macroeconomic\r\nstability, as well as stability of the national currency. In\r\nfact, inflation rates have practically been reduced to zero,\r\nand since 1996 steady growth in the gross domestic\r\nproduct has been restored. Internal stability achieved as a\r\nresult of the leadership’s consistent policy, as well as\r\nreforms implemented, have provided a favourable climate\r\nfor investments in the country.\r\nToday, Azerbaijan continues with the reform of its\r\nbanking system and privatization of State-owned\r\nenterprises. I would like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for\r\ntheir support to the stabilization programme in Azerbaijan\r\nand for financing the structural transformations in its\r\neconomy. I would like to offer our assurances of the\r\nirreversibility of the course of economic reforms taken by\r\nour Government and to express the hope that these\r\nimportant financial institutions will increase their\r\nassistance to Azerbaijan.\r\nIn its economic policy, our country attaches the\r\nhighest priority to its integration into the world economy.\r\nSituated at the junction of Eastern and Western\r\ncivilization, and having been for centuries a link between\r\nEurope and Asia, Azerbaijan is implementing a systematic\r\nprogramme aimed at its smooth integration into the world\r\neconomy, and attaches great importance to the\r\ndevelopment of fruitful and mutually beneficial regional\r\ncooperation based on mutual respect for the sovereignty\r\nand interests of all States, as well as on the principle of\r\nnon-interference in internal affairs of other countries.\r\nIn this connection, the country’s leadership regards\r\nas strategically important the concept of creating an East-\r\nWest corridor, and in particular the development of the\r\nEurope-Caucasus-Asia transportation link. The Transport\r\nCorridor: Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA)\r\nprogramme, established by the Commission of the\r\nEuropean Union in 1993, is designed to promote the\r\ndevelopment of interconnected national and regional\r\ntransportation infrastructures to enhance cooperation\r\nbetween countries in Europe, the Black Sea region, the\r\nCaucasus, the Caspian Sea region and Asia.\r\nImplementation of this programme will provide reliable\r\naccess to the trans-European and trans-Asian\r\ntransportation systems for the landlocked countries of the\r\nCaucasus and Central Asia. During the last five years\r\nclose interaction between the States involved in the\r\nprogramme and active support by the Commission of the\r\nEuropean Union have contributed to substantial progress\r\nin modernization and construction of communications, the\r\ndevelopment of relevant laws and codes and the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nimprovement of the customs and tariff policies of\r\nparticipant States.\r\nThe results of five years of work were reviewed at the\r\nInternational Conference on the Restoration of the Historic\r\nSilk Route, held at the capital of Azerbaijan, the city of\r\nBaku, on 7-8 September this year. That Conference brought\r\ntogether delegations from 32 countries, including nine heads\r\nof State, and representatives of 13 international\r\norganizations. The major outcome of the Conference was\r\nthe signing of the Principal multilateral agreement on\r\ninternational transport for development of the corridor\r\nEurope-Caucasus-Asia, which is an important institutional\r\nmechanism for promoting the development and regulation\r\nof international transportation, as well as for coordinating\r\nand harmonizing transportation policies and legal\r\nframeworks in this field of transportation. The Baku\r\nConference has become a major cornerstone in terms of\r\nstrengthening and enhancing cooperation aimed at the\r\nfurther development of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia\r\ntransportation corridor in the interests of the economic\r\nprogress of all the participating States.\r\nThe delegation of Azerbaijan is counting on the\r\nsupport of the other Member States for this programme. We\r\nare convinced that the restoration of the historic silk route\r\nand the involvement of other countries and regions in this\r\nproject would provide a strong impetus to the process of\r\nrapprochement and reciprocal enrichment of our peoples, a\r\nstrengthening of their independence and sovereignty, as\r\nwell as the successful implementation in those States of\r\ndemocratic and market-oriented reforms.\r\nCarrying out plans to deliver carbohydrate resources\r\nproduced by Azerbaijan and other countries of the Caspian\r\nbasin to world markets by means of multiple pipelines is an\r\nintegral part of the East-West concept, which is of\r\ninestimable importance for strengthening the independence\r\nand security of sovereign States, as well as for their\r\neconomic and other development. We expect international\r\nfinancial institutions and other investors to show due\r\ninterest in these projects, which can rightly be called a\r\nbridge to the third millennium.\r\nUnfortunately, however, we are obliged to admit that\r\nthe model of the progressive development of sovereign\r\nStates of the region proposed by Azerbaijan is not accepted\r\nby all. The position taken by Armenia in the region still\r\nremains a serious obstacle to this process.\r\nThe question of a settlement of the conflict between\r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan, which has lasted for more than 10\r\nyears now, is a key issue in Azerbaijan’s foreign policy.\r\nRelevant resolutions of the Security Council and the\r\ndecisions of the OSCE have made it possible to create a\r\nnecessary normative legal basis for the settlement of this\r\nconflict. In this context, it is necessary in particular to\r\nstress the codifying role and universality of the principles\r\ncontained in the Lisbon statement made by the Chairman-\r\nin-Office of the OSCE. These principles, namely,\r\nrecognition of the territorial integrity of Armenia and\r\nAzerbaijan, a high level of autonomy for Nagorny\r\nKarabakh within the Azerbaijan State and the provision of\r\nsecurity and safety for the entire population of Nagorny\r\nKarabakh, are fully in keeping with the principles\r\nenshrined in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 and are\r\ncomprehensive in nature, which makes possible their\r\napplication with an equal degree of effectiveness not only\r\nto the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, but to all\r\nother regional conflicts as well.\r\nA positive balance has recently been achieved. An\r\ninstitute of mediation has been created, comprising the\r\nMinsk Group of the OSCE and its Co-Chairmen. The\r\nparameters for the settlement process have been\r\nestablished, providing for the elimination of the\r\nconsequences of the armed conflict and, on this basis, a\r\nresolution of the political problems. As a result of\r\nAzerbaijan’s persistence, it was possible in October 1997\r\nto find points of contiguity with Armenia’s position, and\r\nreal opportunities for progress have emerged. The\r\nsubsequent internal political events in Armenia, however,\r\nand the resulting drastic revision of its attitudes led to a\r\ndecline in the dynamism of the Minsk process.\r\nA just and lasting settlement cannot be achieved by\r\nArmenia’s military pressure on Azerbaijan, by its\r\ncontinuing occupation of parts of the territory of the\r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan and by increasing its military\r\npotential there, by putting forward preconditions for the\r\nresumption of negotiations on the basis of the results of\r\nArmenia’s aggression, or by imposing new procedural\r\nframeworks on the negotiations process, in order to\r\nperpetuate the situation resulting from the conflict.\r\nIllegal transfers of arms from Russia to Armenia,\r\nworth more than $1 billion, and regular joint military\r\nexercises of those countries designed to increase the\r\noffensive potential of the Armenia’s armed forces not\r\nonly prevent a facilitation of the settlement, but also have\r\na direct destabilizing impact on the situation in the region.\r\nAzerbaijan once again states its commitment to a\r\npeaceful resolution of the conflict and the strict\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nimplementation of the ceasefire regime, until an agreement\r\non the settlement of the armed conflict is reached, in the\r\nhopes that the same approach will be taken by the\r\nArmenian side. Azerbaijan calls on Armenia to accept the\r\nproposals of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference as\r\na basis for negotiations within the format of the Minsk\r\nGroup. Today, as never before, it is important for the\r\ninternational community to preserve its consistency,\r\ndetermination and persistence in upholding its declared\r\nposition on the settlement of the conflict between Armenia\r\nand Azerbaijan.\r\nNobody should be in any doubt that progressive\r\ndevelopment of the States of the region can only be\r\nachieved through the establishment of just and lasting peace\r\nand stability in the southern Caucasian region on the basis\r\nof respect for sovereignty and the territorial integrity of its\r\nStates. Azerbaijan believes that international organizations,\r\nas well as the entire international community, should more\r\nactively utilize their potential to further promote the\r\npeaceful negotiation process and the achievement of a\r\npolitical settlement to the conflict.\r\nDuring its last session, in response to the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General, the General\r\nAssembly adopted important decisions aimed at reforming\r\nthe Organization. Azerbaijan regards the work already done\r\nto this end as a solid basis for further adaptation of the\r\nOrganization to the quickly changing needs and imperatives\r\nof today’s world. We stand ready to further contribute to\r\nthe implementation of these decisions intended to prepare\r\nthe world Organization better to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nUndoubtedly, in this regard, the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is of special importance. In our view, it is\r\nexpedient to adopt relevant decisions on this extremely\r\nsensitive issue on the basis of the broadest support of\r\nMember States and in accordance Article 108 of the\r\nCharter. Asia, Africa and Latin America should be\r\nrepresented in both categories of membership of the\r\nSecurity Council in a manner appropriate to current political\r\nrealities. Given the fact that the number of countries in the\r\nEastern European Group has doubled, we once again point\r\nout the need to allocate to that Group an additional non-\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council.\r\nAddressing the question of the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil and the enhancement of the efficiency of its work,\r\nwe cannot fail to draw attention to the fact that the four\r\nSecurity Council resolutions on the conflict between\r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan have still not been implemented.\r\nWe have repeatedly stressed that a review of the\r\npersonnel policy of the United Nations should be an\r\nintegral part of the Organization’s reform. We remain\r\nextremely concerned by the fact that the Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan is still not represented in the Secretariat.\r\nIt is unfortunate that emergencies arising from\r\nmilitary conflicts and acts of military aggression are still\r\na pressing issue today. Millions of people continue to lose\r\ntheir homes, health and property, and are becoming\r\ninternally displaced persons.\r\nThe people of my country have experienced the pain\r\nand misfortune of such a loss, having fallen victim to the\r\nArmenian aggression of which I have spoken. Every\r\nseventh citizen of Azerbaijan bears the burdens of the\r\nrefugee’s life, deprived of his home in his native land,\r\nsuffering from heat in summer and cold in winter in\r\ntemporary tent camps. In occupied Azerbaijani territory,\r\nhundreds of towns and villages have been destroyed,\r\npractically all of the houses, schools, hospitals and\r\nindustrial facilities have been burned down or plundered\r\nand ancient cultural monuments have been razed. Coping\r\nwith the refugee emergency and the restoration of what\r\nhas been lost are two of the main concerns of the\r\nAzerbaijan State. These problems cannot be resolved until\r\nthe occupying forces are withdrawn from Azerbaijani\r\nterritory and all the refugees and displaced persons have\r\nbeen returned to the places from which they were\r\nexpelled by force.\r\nThe Azerbaijan Government is doing a great deal to\r\nalleviate the situation. The role of the United Nations and\r\nits agencies in this process can scarcely be overestimated.\r\nIn addition to providing direct humanitarian assistance to\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, at the present\r\ntime a project is under way to restore a part of the Fisuli\r\ndistrict, which was freed from the occupying Armenian\r\nunits. This project is being carried out by the Government\r\nof Azerbaijan, the World Bank, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and\r\nother agencies and organizations. However, the emerging\r\ntrend of reduction in the volume of humanitarian\r\nassistance to Azerbaijan cannot fail to disturb us. While\r\nexpressing our most sincere gratitude to the United\r\nNations, its specialized agencies and donor countries for\r\ntheir support and concrete assistance, we call on them not\r\nto decrease in the future the volume of their humanitarian\r\naid to the people in Azerbaijan who are suffering from\r\naggression and who live in the most unbearable\r\nconditions.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nI should like to advantage of this opportunity to briefly\r\nrefer to our cooperation with UNDP, which is playing a\r\nvery positive role in the social, political and economic\r\ndevelopment of our country. Assistance from UNDP, the\r\nmajor source of subsidies necessary for carrying out\r\ndevelopment activities, is vital to resolve a number of\r\nserious problems in Azerbaijan that were mentioned earlier.\r\nWe welcome the system of Resident Coordinators and\r\nhighly commend the activity of the Resident Coordinator in\r\nAzerbaijan, designated by the Secretary-General, who is\r\nacting as the leader of the United Nations team in the\r\ncountry. At the same time, given the difficult financial\r\nconstraints facing UNDP, I should like to call upon all\r\nMember States to increase their voluntary contributions to\r\nthe budget of the Programme so that the recipient countries,\r\nincluding Azerbaijan, can more effectively use its potential\r\nto their advantage.\r\nThe consolidation of efforts of Member States with a\r\nview to launching a decisive attack against crime, drugs and\r\nterrorism continues to be a priority. Combating these\r\nphenomena can be successful only if all countries truly join\r\nforces. Azerbaijan, which has had to confront these real\r\nthreats to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, in\r\nparticular from Armenian terrorism, considers itself an\r\nactive participant in the fight against these evils.\r\nAzerbaijan welcomes the results of the Rome\r\nDiplomatic Conference to establish an International\r\nCriminal Court. We are convinced that an efficient, capable,\r\nindependent and authoritative court will contribute to\r\nstrengthening international cooperation for the effective\r\nprosecution and suppression of aggression, genocide and\r\nmilitary crimes, which are the most heinous crimes\r\nconstituting a threat to international peace and security. As\r\na State that is experiencing all the sufferings and tragedy of\r\naggression by Armenia, Azerbaijan is deeply interested in\r\nthe establishment and effective functioning of international\r\nlegal mechanisms for the prosecution of those responsible\r\nfor the aforementioned crimes.\r\nThere are fewer than 500 days remaining until the end\r\nof this century, and we have no time to relax, no right to\r\nrest on our laurels. Approaching the end of the historic\r\nnineties, the United Nations, bringing together both the\r\nprosperous States and those who have overcome numerous\r\ncalamities but have gained their independence and stability,\r\nmust take all necessary measures to justify the efforts\r\nalready made and to achieve the objectives that have been\r\nset. Fulfilment of the tasks at hand and finding solutions to\r\nthe problems we face constitute the baggage that this\r\nrespected Organization and its Member States will take\r\nwith them into the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the head of\r\ndelegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, His Excellency\r\nMr. Abuzed Omar Dorda.\r\nMr. Dorda (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): Allow me at the outset to congratulate\r\nMr. Opertti on his accession to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. His election is a tribute\r\nto his friendly country and an expression of confidence in\r\nhis ability to shoulder this great responsibility.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express our deep\r\nappreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his skilful\r\nguidance of the deliberations of the previous session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Furthermore, I would also like to\r\nexpress my country’s high appreciation to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for his initiatives, which have helped\r\nease tensions in a number of regions, and for his efforts\r\nin making a series of serious proposals for the reform of\r\nthe United Nations and to reactivate its role, thereby\r\nallowing it to perform the functions entrusted to it by the\r\nCharter.\r\nThe United Nations is the only Organization which\r\nenjoys universal membership. That is why it is the sole\r\nforum qualified to deal with urgent international, political,\r\neconomic and social problems. To address these questions\r\neffectively, it is essential, first and foremost, to observe\r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which\r\nmust govern both the work of the Organization and the\r\nconduct of its Members. Our commitment to the\r\nprinciples of sovereign equality, non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States and abstention from the threat or\r\nuse of force requires us to oppose the ambitions and\r\npractices of certain countries that seek to impose their\r\nhegemony and influence and to monopolize privileges.\r\nThe mandated powers of the General Assembly, in\r\nparticular, should be expanded to allow it to play its\r\nrightful role, which is based on equality among all its\r\nmembers and on the fact that they all deliberate on an\r\nequal footing, including in their consideration of questions\r\nof international peace and security. It would be helpful in\r\nthis respect to establish a mechanism to enable the\r\nAssembly to oversee the work of other organs, including\r\nthe Security Council, and to hold them accountable to it.\r\nAny wealthy country in arrears that cares about the\r\nUnited Nations should pay those arrears immediately and\r\nunconditionally, because they are to blame for the\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nfinancial deterioration affecting the activities of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations will remain\r\nincomplete without reforming the Security Council to\r\neliminate the privilege of the veto power. Historically and\r\nin terms of justice, equality and democracy, there is no\r\nlonger any justification for that power. My country was the\r\nfirst to call for the abrogation of the veto power in the\r\nsecond half of this century. Moreover, it is essential to\r\nremove the current imbalance in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council, not by granting certain countries\r\npermanent membership, but through an increase in the\r\nnumber of its members, based on the principle of full\r\nsovereign equality among States and the application of the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution in both\r\ncategories of Council membership: permanent and non-\r\npermanent. The reform of the Council should, first and\r\nforemost, respond to the needs of the developing countries,\r\nwhich constitute the majority of the United Nations\r\nmembership, and to the need to avoid selectivity.\r\nDespite the efforts of African countries and their\r\nOrganization, conflict is on the rise and economic\r\nconditions are further deteriorating on that continent.\r\nWhatever development or increase in income they achieve\r\ngoes to servicing debts that weigh heavily on them all. In\r\nhis report on the situation in Africa, the Secretary-General\r\nexplains that this situation is the result of the policies\r\nadopted by the colonial Powers at the 1885 Congress of\r\nBerlin to partition the continent. These policies remain the\r\nroot cause of conflict in Africa. The report further indicates\r\nthat Africa’s problems, including political instability in\r\nsome parts and economic underdevelopment in most of the\r\ncontinent, were caused by those who drew the political\r\nborders of African countries. We call for the cancellation of\r\nAfrica’s debts and for the continent to be dealt with on new\r\nand fair bases, not just as a source of raw materials and a\r\nmarket for the consumption of manufactured goods.\r\nThe responsibility for all that has happened and is still\r\ntaking place on the African continent falls to those who\r\ncaused it in the first place. Therefore, it is high time for the\r\nStates that colonized Africa, exploited its resources and\r\nenslaved its peoples to apologize to the continent and to\r\npay full compensation for all the losses it has incurred as\r\na result of colonialism.\r\nThe imposition of restrictions on international trade\r\nand the legislation of extraterritorial laws require serious\r\naction on our part to confront and put an end to them.\r\nMember States are called upon to support and vote in\r\nfavour of the relevant draft resolution to be submitted to\r\nthe General Assembly at this session and not to recognize\r\nsuch unilateral laws, which undermine the lofty principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter, flagrantly violate the rules\r\nof international law, encroach on the sovereignty of\r\nMember States and blatantly interfere in their internal\r\naffairs.\r\nThe question of Palestine is still awaiting a solution.\r\nAll developments, past and present, serve only to confirm\r\nwhat my country has repeatedly stated: Occupation by\r\nforce and the dictation and imposition of surrender can\r\nnever lead to peace. No support for the occupation and\r\nthe settlement policy or undermining of the balance of\r\npower will help to establish peace. The displaced\r\nPalestinians living outside their land are far more\r\nnumerous than those who live on Palestinian territory.\r\nWhat kind of peace is it that prevents a people from\r\nreturning to their territory, their homeland?\r\nThe continued occupation of the Syrian Golan since\r\n1967, the occupation of southern Lebanon, and the way\r\nin which the Security Council has been prevented from\r\nimplementing its resolution 425 (1978) are further proof\r\nof the weakening of the United Nations as a result of the\r\nintervention of the major Powers. In this respect, we\r\nwould ask: Why does the Security Council insist on the\r\nimplementation of some and not all of its resolutions? So\r\nlong as the United Nations remains paralysed by the\r\nblatant interference of the powerful, who exploit it only\r\nto serve their own interests and prevent it from acting\r\nwhen there is a question of deterring or repulsing\r\naggression by their allies, this glaring injustice will\r\ncontinue to push the Middle East towards the abyss.\r\nThe achievement of the universality of the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\r\nexpansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones are facing major\r\nobstacles. In the Arab East, the rulers of Tel Aviv still\r\nrefuse to adhere to the NPT. They refuse to place their\r\nnuclear facilities under the control regime of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. They continue to\r\ndevelop their nuclear capabilities with the financial and\r\ntechnical support of the United States, the very country\r\nthat, under the pretext of saving the world from chemical\r\nweapons, threatens to attack any Arab country, including\r\nmy own, merely for building a pharmaceutical plant. The\r\nrecent destruction of the Sudanese pharmaceutical factory\r\nunder such flimsy pretexts, later proven false, is still fresh\r\nin our minds.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nNobody should be deceived by the utterings of the\r\nrulers of Tel Aviv to the effect that the Arabs and their\r\nweapons are a source of danger. Neither Libya nor any\r\nother Arab State constitutes a threat to the peace of the\r\nregion, let alone the whole world. These are countries that\r\nneither produce nor export weapons. Washington has\r\ndestroyed the weapons that Iraq once had and has imposed\r\nembargoes on other countries to prevent Iraq from\r\nimporting arms. The real danger to security in the region\r\nand the entire world comes from the Israelis, who possess\r\nhundreds of nuclear warheads. So long as nuclear weapons\r\nand other weapons of mass destruction are not destroyed in\r\nall the countries that possess them, any lesser effort will\r\nrepresent a great attempt to deceive the whole world.\r\nSince the dawn of time, humanity has been afflicted\r\nby a phenomenon that has been exacerbated in modern\r\ntimes: national and international terrorism. The annals of\r\nhistory record terrorist acts, their victims and their\r\nperpetrators. If we peruse these records, much is revealed.\r\nThey show that those self-styled fighters against terrorism\r\nwere the first to perpetrate terrorism. By posing as fighters\r\nof terrorism, they are trying to cover the terrorist crimes\r\nthey have committed and still commit against other\r\ncountries and peoples. Their history is no more than a\r\nseries of terrorist acts against other peoples, which have\r\nreached the stage of total annihilation of entire peoples.\r\nThese self-styled fighters of terrorism have attempted\r\nto brand movements of liberation and the struggle for\r\nfreedom and against occupation as terrorist. They still\r\ndescribe all fighters for freedom and independence as\r\nterrorists. But they fail miserably when most fighters for the\r\nfreedom and independence of their countries eventually\r\ntriumph. Suddenly, those who fought against these freedom\r\nfighters and backed those who enslaved them are ready to\r\nroll out the red carpet for them, organize the greatest\r\nreceptions and award them the highest medals. This General\r\nAssembly embraces a number of such leaders every year\r\nand, only a few days ago, gave the fighter and leader\r\nNelson Mandela an outstanding reception.\r\nLibya is proud to have been among the countries that\r\nsupported these leaders during their struggle. Libya takes\r\npride in their victories. Libya took that position at a time\r\nwhen those who now claim to fight terrorism used to\r\ndescribe those leaders as terrorists. Libya knows that the\r\nchange in these countries’ attitudes following the triumph\r\nof revolutionaries and freedom fighters neither reflects\r\nprincipled morality, nor aims at atoning for past mistakes.\r\nIt is due to a desire to preserve their interests and to gain\r\ngreater political and economic advantages.\r\nWhen we talk of terrorism, we should know our\r\nsubject. Our talk must be objective and we need to agree\r\non a single definition of terrorism. We should apply the\r\nsame criteria and the same rules and laws. We must also\r\nimplement the same measures and procedures. We cannot\r\ncondemn terrorism and fight it when it hits a certain\r\ncountry, then turn a blind eye when it hits other countries\r\nor other peoples. The occupation of Lebanon, the\r\nsurrounding of its capital and the attack on Qana were\r\nacts of terrorism. The aggression against Libya in 1986\r\nand earlier was terrorism. The invasion of Grenada was\r\nterrorism. The kidnapping of a head of State is terrorism.\r\nMaintaining military bases on other peoples’ territory is\r\nterrorism. Navies’ threats and attacks against peoples and\r\nviolation of their territorial waters — this is terrorism.\r\nAttempts on the lives of national leaders are terrorism.\r\nThe downing of a Libyan civilian airplane over Sinai was\r\nterrorism. The downing of the Iranian airplane in the Gulf\r\nwas terrorism. Forcing the Security Council to react to a\r\nmissile that fell in the sea and preventing it from reacting\r\nto missiles that were intentionally launched against a\r\npharmaceutical plant in a peaceful city, Khartoum, and\r\nfrom sending a mere fact-finding mission — this is\r\nterrorism. In this respect, we forcefully support Sudanese\r\ndemands for investigation and compensation and condemn\r\nthis terrorist aggression.\r\nAre we supposed to condemn terrorism only when\r\nit touches a certain country or countries? Should we turn\r\na blind eye and a deaf ear to what is being committed by\r\nthat country or those countries against humanity as a\r\nwhole? This, too, is terrorism. Terrorism will be\r\neradicated only when its causes, not just its results, are\r\naddressed; not by committing similar terrorist acts. We\r\ncannot fight terrorism with terrorism. As one Arab poet\r\nsays:\r\n“Practise what you preach. Great shame on you if\r\nyou do not.”\r\nWe in Libya condemn terrorist acts, their\r\nperpetrators, their sponsors and those who finance them.\r\nWe are ready to cooperate with all countries that truly\r\nwant to put an end to terrorism. Libya, in a letter to the\r\nSecretary-General dated 9 January 1992 (document\r\nA/46/840), was the first to call on the United Nations to\r\nconvene a special session of the General Assembly to be\r\ndevoted to international terrorism.\r\nIn this respect, we wish to note that some people\r\ninsist, in and out of context, on linking Islam and\r\nMuslims to terrorism. This in itself is another kind of\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nterrorism. The very name of Islam is derived from the word\r\nsalaam, which means “peace”. A person is considered a\r\nMuslim when others are safe from his words and his deeds.\r\nThe greeting of Muslims, when coming or going, is\r\nassalamu alaikum, meaning “peace be upon you”, and the\r\nanswer is “and the same to you”.\r\nIt seems believable that, as has been demonstrated in\r\nsome works and studies, certain people can determine their\r\nown identity only by identifying their enemy. Now that the\r\nideological enemy, embodied for several decades in the\r\ncommunist ideology, has disappeared, they have chosen\r\nIslam as their new alternative adversary. Upon the\r\ndisappearance of the international opponent, the former\r\nSoviet Union, they chose the Muslims to be the new\r\nenemy.\r\nAt this juncture, let us ask the following questions,\r\nthough we know in advance that they will go unanswered.\r\nFirst, who recruited, transported, financed, trained and\r\narmed those who fought in Afghanistan during the presence\r\nof Soviet troops there? Secondly, who called these people\r\nmujahidin when they fought against the Soviets in\r\nAfghanistan? And who now calls them terrorists? How and\r\nwhy did yesterday’s mujahid become today’s terrorist?\r\nThirdly, where do the leaders of the organizations which\r\nplan and supervise the implementation of terrorist actions\r\nin their homelands live? Sisterly Algeria is not the only\r\nexample. Fourthly, who protects these people? Who\r\nfinances them? Who arms them? Who trains them? Where?\r\nAnd Why?\r\nThese and other, similar questions will not be publicly\r\nacknowledged by the parties concerned, but that does not\r\nmean that there is no answer. Islam is the victim. Muslims\r\nare the targets and victims of terrorism, alongside the rest\r\nof third world peoples. God Almighty addresses his Prophet\r\nand Messenger in the Koran by saying:\r\n“We sent thee not, but as a mercy for all creatures.”\r\n(The Holy Koran, XXI:107)\r\nVerily spoke God. The Prophet of mercy preached the\r\nreligion of mercy, not terrorism.\r\nMy country has always sought to make the\r\nMediterranean a region of security, cooperation and peace.\r\nIt is a source of satisfaction that in July this year we issued\r\na joint statement with Italy which eliminated many aspects\r\nof the legacy of the past and laid down a solid basis for\r\ncooperation to serve the interests of both countries and\r\npeoples and contribute to the strengthening of peace and\r\nstability in that strategic part of the world. We believe\r\nthat this is a model that should be emulated in other\r\narrangements, including European and Mediterranean\r\npartnerships. Among the issues on which the peoples of\r\nthe Mediterranean should cooperate and act in solidarity\r\nis the foreign military presence in the region. We in\r\nLibya would again like to express our concern about this\r\npresence. We again call on foreign States to dismantle\r\ntheir military bases around the Mediterranean and\r\nwithdraw their fleets from its waters. Their presence\r\nposes a danger to the peoples of the region.\r\nThe world is still witnessing a continuation of old\r\ndisputes and conflicts such as those in Cyprus,\r\nAfghanistan, Angola and Somalia. These conflicts have\r\npersisted for too long, despite all the efforts made to\r\nresolve them peacefully. The international community\r\nshould increase its efforts to settle these disputes and end\r\nthe suffering of their peoples.\r\nThe people of Iraq are suffering from international\r\nsanctions which are unprecedented in their severity and\r\ncruelty. These sanctions have resulted in human tragedies\r\nwhich could never be accepted by principled human\r\nbeings. Other countries have exploited these sanctions in\r\norder to achieve their own selfish political purpose of\r\ndestroying Iraq, violating its territorial integrity and\r\nbreaking up its unity. This will have disastrous\r\nconsequences sooner or later. Furthermore, it is a\r\nviolation of the Charter, the principles of international law\r\nand all international norms.\r\nIn the Horn of Africa the situation in Somalia is still\r\na source of great concern. My country has consistently\r\nmade efforts to assist the competing Somali factions solve\r\ntheir differences. We will continue those efforts with a\r\nview to reaching a solution to ensure Somali national\r\nreconciliation that is satisfactory to all Somalis. The\r\nJamahiriya, which has the honour of presiding over the\r\ngroup of Sahel and desert countries, has submitted a\r\nserious initiative for the settlement of the dispute between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea. This initiative, which enjoys full\r\nrecognition, remains the best framework for the solution\r\nof the border dispute between the two countries and the\r\nnormalization of relations between their two peoples.\r\nI should now like to provide an account of the latest\r\ndevelopments in the dispute between my country and the\r\nUnited States and the United Kingdom over the Lockerbie\r\nquestion. In this regard, I shall deal with the latest, not\r\nthe oldest, of these developments. On 21 July the media\r\nannounced that the United States and the United Kingdom\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nwere considering the possibility of accepting the two\r\nsuspects for trial in a third country, which may be the\r\nNetherlands.\r\nLibya contacted the President of the Security Council\r\nand most of its members, as well as the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, to welcome this development in the event\r\nthat it became an official position. To prove and confirm its\r\nseriousness, Libya suggested to them that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should look into the matter once it became an\r\nofficial position and contact all the parties to seek to reach\r\na practical and serious formula that would respond to the\r\ninterests of all the parties and could gain their approval.\r\nOur intention was that if such a formula were submitted to\r\nthe Security Council, its approval would be assured and its\r\nimplementation would thereby be a foregone conclusion.\r\nAt the time, Libya expressed a number of fears and\r\nconcerns to which it drew attention and warned against the\r\nSecurity Council approving any formula that did not\r\naddress such fears and concerns in its enthusiasm of feeling\r\nthat there was a positive development on the issue.\r\nAt that time — the last week of July — we drew\r\nattention to the fact that Libya was concerned that the other\r\nparty might have taken its approach for certain short-term\r\nreasons: first, to circumvent the two Judgments of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice; secondly, to pre-empt the\r\ndecision taken at the Ouagadougou summit; thirdly, to\r\nforestall a potential resolution at the Durban summit;\r\nfourthly, to continue the sanctions imposed on Libya;\r\nfifthly, to distance between the international community and\r\nsupport for Libya by misleading it into believing that the\r\nother party had already accepted the proposals of regional\r\nand international organizations; and sixthly, to take the\r\nwhole question back to its starting point.\r\nAt that time, before the official position of the two\r\ncountries was made public and as a test of the seriousness\r\nof the other party, Libya stressed the need for certain\r\nconsiderations. First, we requested a guarantee that the two\r\nsuspects would not be handed over or moved to either the\r\nUnited States or the United Kingdom. Secondly, we asked\r\nfor a guarantee of their legal, religious, social, personal and\r\nhealth rights throughout the various phases of the trial.\r\nThirdly, we requested that the Libyan judicial authorities\r\nand the defence of the two suspects should handle all\r\ntechnical, legal questions relevant to the legal aspect of the\r\ntrial. We were now talking about a legal and not a political\r\nmatter. The legal and judicial authorities of the countries\r\nconcerned had done so with regard to their side of the\r\nquestion.\r\nOur intuition proved right and our suspicions were\r\nconfirmed. On Monday, 24 August 1998, the United\r\nStates and the United Kingdom addressed a joint letter to\r\nthe Secretary-General to which they attached the text of\r\na draft agreement between the Government of the\r\nKingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, together with the text of a bill which\r\nthe United Kingdom intended to enact as law to enable\r\nthe Scottish Court to conduct the trial in the Netherlands.\r\nOn Tuesday, 25 August, the two countries submitted\r\na draft resolution to the Security Council. On Wednesday,\r\n26 August, the draft resolution was formally submitted to\r\nthe Council. On Thursday, 27 August, as we expected, the\r\nSecurity Council approved the draft resolution, motivated\r\nby a feeling that it was a positive development, without\r\npausing to discover the poison that was slipped\r\nsurreptitiously into the honey.\r\nThe letter sent to the Secretary-General, together\r\nwith its detailed and complicated legal attachments, was\r\napproved without giving even the members of the\r\nSecurity Council a chance to study them. Libya then\r\nrequested the Council to postpone acting on the resolution\r\nbecause it and its attachments required consideration by\r\nthe competent Libyan judicial authorities. These\r\ndocuments had not at that time reached Libya and had not\r\neven been translated into Arabic.\r\nThe adversary and the arbiter in the Council\r\nprevented the Council from responding to Libya’s request.\r\nDuring the review session last March, the same adversary\r\nand the same arbiter prevented the Council from studying\r\nthe Judgments of the International Court of Justice,\r\nofficially referred to it by Libya, under the pretext that\r\nthese Judgments needed to be studied by legal experts in\r\ntheir two countries. This stark contradiction in positions\r\nand criteria we leave to the judgement of the Assembly,\r\nand we have no doubt that it will reach the right\r\nconclusions.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1192 (1998), adopted on\r\n27 August 1998, suggests that the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya has not implemented the requirements of\r\nCouncil resolutions, as in paragraph 1 it\r\n“Demands once again that the Libyan\r\nGovernment immediately comply with the above-\r\nmentioned resolutions.”\r\nThis refers to resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), 883\r\n(1993). It also suggests that Libya has done nothing in\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nthat connection, whereas Libya has responded fully to all of\r\nthese resolutions.\r\nParagraph 4 of resolution 1192 (1998) states that\r\n“the Libyan Government shall ensure that any\r\nevidence or witnesses in Libya are, upon the request\r\nof the court, promptly made available at the court in\r\nthe Netherlands for the purpose of the trial”.\r\nTo ask Libya to provide evidence and witnesses\r\ncontradicts logic and law. It is not Libya that has accused\r\nthe two suspects. It is the United States and the United\r\nKingdom that claim to possess evidence which justifies\r\ntheir suspicions. They alone have the responsibility to\r\nprovide the evidence and the witnesses for the prosecution\r\nin order to prove their case. This demand in itself proves\r\nthat those two countries have no evidence to support the\r\naccusation of our two citizens. On what, then, is this\r\nsuspicion based? It is a suspicion still in search of evidence\r\nand witnesses. The best quotation we can cite in this\r\nrespect is the statement made by the freedom fighter and\r\nleader, President Nelson Mandela, last week in Washington:\r\n“I know of no system of jurisprudence anywhere in the\r\nworld where the accused is required to produce witnesses\r\nfor the prosecution.”\r\nOn the whole, in the text to which I have been\r\nreferring, Libya sees interference in the work and\r\nprocedures of the court, a limitation on the rights of the\r\naccused to defend themselves, and an abrogation of Libya’s\r\nlegal rights guaranteed under international law and custom\r\ngoverning procedures and the provision of proof.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1192 (1998) referred to the\r\njoint letter dated 24 August 1998 from the Governments of\r\nthe United Kingdom and of the United States, contained in\r\ndocument S/1998/795, to which is annexed the text of the\r\nintended agreement between the Governments of the\r\nKingdom of the Netherlands and of the United Kingdom.\r\nIn its article 16 (2), that agreement refers to the\r\n“transfer [of] the accused from the premises of the\r\nScottish Court [in the Netherlands] to the territory of\r\nthe United Kingdom ...,\r\n“(a) ... for the purpose of trial by jury in\r\nScotland”. (S/1998/795, annex II)\r\nHowever, the initiative adopted by the Security Council,\r\nwhich in essence is a political initiative, is based on what\r\nwas adopted by the regional and international organizations\r\nwhose letters were cited in the preambular part of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1192 (1998). Here we would\r\nlike to refer in particular to the content of the joint letter\r\nfrom the Secretaries-General of the League of Arab States\r\nand of the Organization of African Unity, annexed to\r\ndocument S/1997/497. Any text that would make it\r\npossible to transfer the two suspects to any place other\r\nthan the Netherlands, under any circumstances, runs\r\ncounter to the regional initiatives accepted by the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya. That is only some of the poison in the\r\nhoney: the world has heard that the United Kingdom and\r\nthe United States have agreed to have a trial in the\r\nNetherlands. Now they talk about Scotland, the United\r\nKingdom and the United States. We shall clarify this\r\npresently.\r\nThe letter then states, in paragraph 4, that, “If found\r\nguilty, the two accused will serve their sentence in the\r\nUnited Kingdom”. Moreover, the intended agreement\r\nstates in article 16 (2) (b) that the accused would be\r\ntransferred to the United Kingdom “for the purpose of\r\nserving a custodial sentence imposed by the Scottish\r\nCourt following the conviction of the accused”.\r\nThat contradicts the initiative; I cannot believe that\r\nanyone understood the initiative to mean anything other\r\nthan that the trial would take place in a third country.\r\nThis provision runs counter to the general understanding\r\nof the initiative, that the purpose of the trial of the two\r\nsuspects is to reveal the truth in the tragic incident of Pan\r\nAm flight 103, and not to exact revenge on two Libyan\r\ncitizens who are merely suspected, without evidence. It is\r\nthe understanding also that the ultimate venue of all the\r\ntrial procedures would be in a third country: in the\r\nNetherlands, and not anywhere else. The agreement by\r\nthe various parties to the holding of the trial in the\r\nNetherlands is a political solution that came about as a\r\nresult of political action. The place where the sentence\r\nshould be served, if, God forbid, they are convicted,\r\nshould be the same place as the trial. This is part of the\r\npolitical solution.\r\nThey claim that Scottish law stipulates that sentences\r\nshould be served in Scotland, because Scottish courts sit\r\nin Scotland. But this court will sit outside Scotland, so\r\nany sentence should also be carried out outside Scotland.\r\nThe court is, exceptionally, sitting in another country, so\r\nthe sentence must be served in the country where the trial\r\ntakes place, not in Scotland.\r\nParagraph 8 of Security Council resolution 1192\r\n(1998) reads in part that the Council\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\n“decides that the aforementioned measures shall be\r\nsuspended immediately if the Secretary-General\r\nreports to the Council that the two accused have\r\narrived in the Netherlands for the purpose of trial\r\nbefore the court described in paragraph 2 or” — and\r\nhere pay attention to this new poison in the honey —\r\n“have appeared for trial before an appropriate court in\r\nthe United Kingdom or the United States”.\r\nIn a dispute that has lasted for more than seven years, this\r\nis the first time that the Security Council has adopted a\r\nresolution asserting that the trial can take place before a\r\ncourt in the United Kingdom or the United States. I have\r\naddressed a letter to the Secretary-General indicating that\r\nthe proposal of the League of Arab States and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity regarding a trial under\r\nScottish law, before a Scottish court, at the International\r\nCourt of Justice in The Hague defines an “appropriate\r\ncourt”. But the resolution says\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“an appropriate court in the United Kingdom or the United\r\nStates”, not an appropriate British or United States court.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nFor the first time, the resolution refers to such a venue.\r\nThere is no need for the addition of a reference to an\r\n“appropriate court in the United Kingdom or the United\r\nStates” — unless the purpose is to transfer the two suspects\r\nto the Netherlands as a transit station before transferring\r\nthem to one of the two countries mentioned in that\r\nparagraph. If that is the case, it can be qualified only as\r\ninstitutional piracy condoned by Security Council\r\nresolution. The world is unaware of this situation. I know\r\nthat members are busy with their own concerns, but I\r\nremind them that I am citing the text of the new Security\r\nCouncil resolution.\r\nAlong with the rest of the international community, we\r\nhave agreed to a trial before a Scottish court sitting in a\r\nthird country, which could be the Netherlands. We have\r\nagreed to a Scottish court, to Scottish law and to Scottish\r\njudges, in the Netherlands. Those are the terms described\r\nin the decisions of the regional organizations. But what\r\ndoes that paragraph mean?\r\nBut Libya never subscribed to these new terms, and\r\nthe regional organizations never agreed that a trial should\r\ntake place in the United States or in the United Kingdom.\r\nTo suggest that this is the “appropriate court” referred to in\r\nparagraph 16 of resolution 883 (1993) is to attempt to\r\ndeceive the international community, and is yet another\r\nexample of the poison in the honey. The Council was\r\nmisled into accepting this because of the existence of a\r\nfeeling that there was a change in the position of the two\r\ncountries.\r\nAnother meaningless reference came in paragraph 8\r\non the relations between the Libyan Government and the\r\nFrench judicial authorities, relevant to the explosion of\r\nUnion de Transports Aériens flight 772. This question has\r\nnothing to do with the subject of the initiative upon which\r\nresolution 1192 (1998) is based. Moreover, it is well\r\nestablished in the Security Council that Libya has done all\r\nthat has been required of it by the French judge in this\r\nrespect and that the French authorities have expressed\r\ntheir total satisfaction, and this was endorsed by the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nLibya believes that the optimal, pragmatic and\r\nprompt solution lies in conducting negotiations among all\r\nparties with a view to reaching an agreement on the\r\npractical procedures for the application of the option of\r\ntrying the two suspects before a Scottish court in a neutral\r\ncountry — the Netherlands — as called for by the summit\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement held in South Africa at the\r\nbeginning of September 1998.\r\nShould direct negotiations prove impossible due to\r\nthe opposition of the United States and the United\r\nKingdom, these negotiations can be conducted through the\r\nSecretary-General. The proposed agreement should\r\ndetermine all practical measures, the commitments of\r\neach party and the rights and guarantees to be accorded\r\nthe two suspects and their defence team. It should also\r\nprecisely state what all the parties are required to do so\r\nthat the trial of the two suspects will be the final phase of\r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions, not\r\nthe first phase. This should lead to the lifting of the\r\nsanctions imposed on Libya and put an end to any\r\nattempts to change positions or otherwise circumvent the\r\nsituation under the pretext that Libya has not fully\r\ncomplied with Security Council resolutions — because\r\nLibya has fully done what it has been required to do.\r\nEven the exchange of goods is governed by\r\nagreements and contracts that regulate and explain the\r\nresponsibilities of various parties, suppliers and exporters.\r\nGoods are insured and reinsured against all risks. These\r\nare people, human beings we are talking about here. They\r\nare not going to the Netherlands for tourism; we’re not\r\ngoing to bid them farewell, have a nice trip. Having said\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nthat, we wonder what is meant by electing to hold the trial\r\nin a military base used by the Americans in the\r\nNetherlands? Is the base that the Americans use as\r\nmembers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the only\r\nplace in the Netherlands where the trial can take place?\r\nWhat is this?\r\nFollowing are some of the questions that the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya deems it necessary to resolve and reach an\r\nagreement on. First, there is a need to agree on listing,\r\nclarifying and determining, in advance, the witnesses\r\nneeded — not only from Libya, but from all parties. The\r\ndefence team should have the right to receive and peruse all\r\nevidence and cross-examine all witnesses. Secondly, there\r\nneeds to be agreement on the place where the suspects\r\nwould spend the time of their sentence in case of\r\nconviction, either in the Netherlands or in Libya. Thirdly,\r\nwe need guarantees that the two suspects will not be\r\nextradited or transferred to either the United States or the\r\nUnited Kingdom for any reason whatsoever at any phase of\r\nthe trial. Fourthly, there needs to be an agreement on the\r\nsecurity, legal, personal, social, health and religious rights\r\nof the two suspects during the various phases of the trial.\r\nWe need to conclude an agreement between the\r\nKingdom of the Netherlands and the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya specifying how the two suspects will be\r\ntransferred to the Netherlands and guaranteeing their\r\nsecurity and safety, during their transfer, stay and their\r\nreturn at the end of the trial. Such an agreement should be\r\nendorsed by the Security Council and implemented under\r\nthe supervision of the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya has accepted a trial of the two suspects\r\nbefore a Scottish court in accordance with Scottish law,\r\npresided over by Scottish judges, that would sit in the\r\nNetherlands, but we will not accept the setting of any\r\nconditions in relation to the implementation of that\r\nproposal. Libya is ready to take this exceptional road in\r\norder to reach a solution to the dispute that would satisfy\r\nthe interests of all parties and in order to settle the\r\noutstanding legal issues through direct negotiations or\r\nthrough the Secretary-General.\r\nLibya has not interfered in the agreements concluded\r\nby the other parties for the purposes of the trial. Also, it\r\nhas not authorized anyone to decide on her behalf matters\r\nrelating to her citizens, because this is its constitutional\r\nright and duty. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands\r\ncan conclude an agreement; this has to do with the\r\nNetherlands court and because the Netherlands is the seat\r\nof the court, but as far as the Libyan citizens are\r\nconcerned, we never authorized anyone to conclude any\r\nagreements on our behalf. We are responsible for our\r\ncitizens, the suspects included. They have a team of\r\nlawyers to defend them. We do not interfere in other\r\nStates’ affairs, nor do we want anyone to interfere with\r\nour affairs either.\r\nWe would like to confirm our seriousness, our desire\r\nand our willingness to close the file of this case and other\r\nfiles as well, and open a new chapter in our relations with\r\nthe countries concerned based on mutual respect and non-\r\ninterference in internal affairs.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her\r\nExcellency The Honourable Taufa Vakatale, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Education and\r\nTechnology of the Republic of Fiji.\r\nMs. Vakatale (Fiji): My country and my delegation\r\nwish to take this opportunity to extend to Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti our warmest congratulations on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. His election to the high office is a tribute to both\r\nhim and his great country. My delegation also wishes to\r\nconvey our deep gratitude and appreciation to the\r\noutgoing President at the fifty-second session of the\r\nAssembly, His Excellency Hennadiy Udovenko of\r\nUkraine, who presided with boundless energy, vision and\r\ncompetence.\r\nChange is a fact of life in our world. Change covers\r\nnew paradigms, new systems, new technologies, new\r\npatterns in international relations and new initiatives\r\naimed at lasting peace and international security.\r\nThus we welcomed the wind of change in the area\r\nof nuclear disarmament when we adopted the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) two\r\nyears ago. My country was the first to ratify the Treaty.\r\nBut the more things change, the more they remain the\r\nsame. Some months ago, India and Pakistan conducted\r\nnuclear tests. My delegation calls on India and Pakistan\r\nto reconsider their nuclear pretensions and to become\r\nparties to the CTBT. We call on all countries to become\r\nparties to this Treaty and to fully implement the\r\nprovisions of the Treaty.\r\nMy delegation would like to see the CTBT improved\r\nto set a clear time-frame for the elimination of all nuclear\r\nweapons. As an imperative for meaningful change, my\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\ndelegation urges all nuclear-weapon States to destroy all\r\nstockpiles and arsenals of nuclear weapons, and in so doing\r\nrid our world, once and for all, of nuclear weapons.\r\nMy delegation also calls for meaningful change\r\nregarding the elimination of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Let us rid our world of chemical weapons and\r\nbiological weapons. We call on all nations to become\r\nparties to the landmines Convention so that we can all act\r\ncollaboratively and meaningfully to rid our world of\r\nlandmines as well.\r\nOver the past three decades, the developing countries\r\nof the world have waged a desperate struggle for\r\nfundamental change in international economic relations in\r\norder to attain economic justice and facilitate economic\r\ndevelopment and sustained economic growth — thereby\r\nlaying the foundation for eradicating the problems of high\r\nunemployment, hunger, disease and poverty, which ravage\r\nthe least developed and developing countries. The\r\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization was\r\nsupposed to have laid the foundation for a new system of\r\ninternational trade relations which would contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of developing and least developed countries.\r\nAs a developing island State, we seek Members’\r\nsupport and indulgence in understanding the special needs\r\nand the vulnerability of small island States. They should be\r\ndifferentiated further, as a separate group of disadvantaged\r\nStates. The work has already started on the determination\r\nof criteria for such differentiation based on a vulnerability\r\nindex.\r\nAmong the members of the United Nations\r\norganizations, development is measured through the human\r\ndevelopment index, which takes into account the expansion\r\nof gross domestic product, real gross domestic product per\r\ncapita, life expectancy of the population and other\r\nyardsticks. However, the hurricane that recently struck a\r\nnumber of islands in the Caribbean, the devastating tidal\r\nwave in northern Papua New Guinea and extreme drought\r\nconditions in many countries, including mine, demonstrate\r\nthe vulnerability of small island States to natural disasters.\r\nWe also sympathize with China and Bangladesh, which\r\nhave suffered from extensive and prolonged flooding.\r\nIn Fiji, the Government right now is providing special\r\nfood and water relief assistance to more than 54,000\r\nhouseholds, or more than a quarter of Fiji’s total\r\npopulation.\r\nBecause of the drought, we are expecting this year\r\na 50 per cent reduction in our production of sugar, which\r\nis our main export, and there is no guarantee for an\r\nimprovement for next year. Also, because of the drought,\r\nwe do not have seeds of sufficient quality to allow for a\r\nquick recovery in the foreseeable future. Such is our\r\nvulnerability, and no part of the aforementioned index has\r\nany real relevance to our calamity. Things may have\r\nchanged, with new names and new systems, but, alas, it\r\nis the same old story.\r\nMr. Filippi Balestra (San Marino), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nI appeal to the United Nations development support\r\nsystem to consider special schemes of assistance covering\r\nnatural disaster situations. There are already examples of\r\nsuch schemes in the Lomé Convention between the\r\nEuropean Union member countries and the African,\r\nCaribbean and Pacific (ACP) States.\r\nThe creation of the World Trade Organization was\r\nintended to lay the foundation for changes in international\r\ntrade by ensuring an open, secure, equitable, transparent\r\nand predictable multilateral trading system. Yet\r\ndeveloping countries continue to be paid paltry prices for\r\ntheir primary products; they continue to be denied access,\r\nunder one pretext or another, to the markets of the\r\ndeveloped countries; and even the little export trade we\r\nhave is being taken away, as in the case of Saint Lucia\r\nand its banana exports to the European Union. Export\r\ntrade is vital to economic development and sustained\r\neconomic growth in developing countries. My delegation\r\ncalls for remedial change in international trade —\r\nfacilitating better prices for primary products, greater\r\naccess to the markets of developed countries and the\r\nretention of special trade arrangements for the essential\r\nexports of developing countries.\r\nWe in the developing countries require substantial\r\nforeign investment capital flows to promote economic\r\ndevelopment, sustained economic growth and social and\r\nhuman development. Regrettably, there has been little\r\nchange in the volume of international capital flows, the\r\npace of such flows and the direction of such flows.\r\nWhere flows have taken place, they have been directed to\r\na handful of developing countries. My delegation calls for\r\nstrategic change in the area of foreign investment through\r\nsubstantial, increased and continuous capital flows to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nWe in the developing countries require new,\r\nenvironmentally sound technologies to facilitate and sustain\r\neconomic development and social and human development.\r\nThere is a dire need for us to participate in and benefit\r\nfrom appropriate, environmentally sound technologies. Yet\r\ndespite our pleas for the cooperation and assistance of the\r\nindustrialized countries for reciprocal change — by the\r\ntransfer of appropriate technologies at an affordable price,\r\nby assisting us in institutional development and capacity-\r\nbuilding to accommodate the transfer of such technologies\r\nand by assisting us with funding, education and training\r\nprogrammes to facilitate the transfer and stimulate increased\r\ncooperation at a business-to-business level — the situation\r\nhas remained virtually the same.\r\nSustainable development is critical to small island\r\ndeveloping States such as mine, for which the paramount\r\nchallenge is to balance economic and social development\r\nwith environmental protection. Six years have passed since\r\nthe first Earth Summit in Rio, and the second summit has\r\ncome and gone. Little progress has been made in securing\r\nnew sources of financing for making the transition to\r\nsustainable development. My delegation calls for\r\nstimulating change on the issue of sustainable development\r\nthrough the prompt and full implementation of the\r\ncommitments and recommendations of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations to make it more\r\nrelevant to today’s world and more responsive to the needs,\r\naspirations and hopes of the international community in all\r\naspects of international relations has engaged our attention\r\nover the years, and more so last year with the presentation\r\nof the Secretary-General’s reform programme. If the reform\r\nof the United Nations is to bring about purposeful change,\r\nthen the Charter of the United Nations should be revised to\r\nremove the anachronisms contained in it and to make it\r\nmore relevant to our world today and tomorrow. A\r\ngeographical reconstruction of regional groups adapted to\r\nthe geopolitical dimensions of today’s world ought to be\r\nimplemented. We submit that the current set of regional\r\ngroups should be increased numerically and reconfigured.\r\nMy delegation further submits that the membership of all\r\nUnited Nations organs and organizations should be\r\ngoverned by the principle of geographic rotation, so that\r\neach country can enjoy its right as a Member to serve on\r\nall United Nations bodies. The current system of rotation\r\nhas resulted in some countries becoming de facto\r\npermanent members of the United Nations organs and\r\norganizations.\r\nThe Security Council is a classic example of things\r\nremaining the same. Membership on the Council,\r\npermanent and non-permanent, continues to be\r\ngeographically inequitable. The system of rotation does\r\nnot provide all Member countries the opportunity to serve\r\non the Council, and the system is further aggravated by\r\nthe number of regional groups and their geographical\r\nconfiguration. My delegation continues to call for a\r\nreview of the membership and operations of the Council.\r\nInternational peace and security has been one of the\r\nmain pillars of the United Nations. This year marks 50\r\nyears of United Nations peacekeeping as an instrument\r\nfor maintaining international peace and security. Yet we\r\nall are still beset by conflicts of one kind or another, and\r\nlasting peace and security in our world continues to elude\r\nus. My country is fully committed to the international\r\npeacekeeping missions of the United Nations.\r\nIn fact, this year also marks 20 years of participation\r\nby my country in United Nations peacekeeping. I should\r\nlike to take this opportunity to pay homage to our brave\r\nsons who have made the supreme sacrifice in the service\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nBecause of the eminent contribution of international\r\npeacekeeping to permanent and lasting peace and security\r\nin our world, we call on all Member countries to settle\r\ntheir assessments for peacekeeping operations promptly\r\nand fully. My delegation would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express to the Secretary-General our\r\nsincere and deep appreciation for citing Fiji, among other\r\ncountries, as consistently among the stalwart nations ready\r\nto contribute troops, police and observers and to take\r\nother steps to improve overall readiness.\r\nMy delegation deeply appreciates the meaningful\r\nchange that has taken place in the scale of assessments of\r\nMember countries. My country welcomes the new\r\nassessment rates. But while such a beneficial measure has\r\ntaken place, the arrears in the annual contributions of\r\nsome Member countries continue to plague our coffers\r\nand to place the finances of our organizations and our\r\nmany and varied international programmes in jeopardy.\r\nMy delegation calls on all Member countries which are in\r\narrears in payment to pay those arrears promptly, fully\r\nand without conditions.\r\nAt a time when so many changes have taken place\r\nin our world in the areas of human development and\r\nhuman rights, the bleak future of the world’s indigenous\r\npeople has remained the same. My delegation calls on the\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\ninternational community to be more responsive to the need\r\nfor a better future for our indigenous people. In the interest\r\nof meaningful change, my delegation calls for the speedy\r\nadoption of the draft Declaration on the Rights of\r\nIndigenous Peoples, the setting up in our Organization of a\r\nunit for indigenous peoples’ affairs, the granting to the\r\nindigenous people of the right of self-determination, and the\r\nestablishment of an international fund to promote and\r\nfacilitate their survival, development and progress.\r\nMy delegation is aware that the most pervasive\r\nviolation of human rights is violence against women, which\r\ncuts across all boundaries of culture, economic status and\r\ngeography. In this connection, the Government of the\r\nRepublic of the Fiji Islands has maintained the\r\ncommitments entered into at Beijing through the\r\nimplementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and met\r\nits obligations under the United Nations Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.\r\nIn promoting greater participation by women in\r\neconomic and social development, a major initiative by the\r\nGovernment will be the launch by our Prime Minister, in\r\nthe next few days, of its National Plan of Action.\r\nAddressed in the Plan will be areas such as the\r\ndevelopment and strengthening of women’s enterprises,\r\ngender parity at decision-making levels, training, promotion\r\nand appointments, domestic violence, sexual abuse and\r\nchild abuse, and review of laws which disadvantage\r\nwomen.\r\nOne area of meaningful change in our world has been\r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea. It enjoys universal\r\nsupport and almost universal participation, and all States\r\nbenefit from the stability and certainty that has been\r\nachieved by the Convention. The work being done with\r\nrespect to the oceans requires the support of the\r\ninternational community if the achievements of the\r\nConvention are to be consolidated and its promise of\r\nbenefits to the peoples of the world realized.\r\nSadly, the more things have changed in the Middle\r\nEast, the more they seem to have remained the same. Peace\r\nin the Middle East remains as elusive and perpetually\r\nshifting as the Negev desert. The international community\r\nmust play a stronger and more decisive role in getting the\r\npeace process on track, keeping it there and ensuring that\r\nit moves at a faster rate. We call on all the parties to the\r\ncrisis to pursue positive and genuine negotiations to effect\r\nmeaningful change through compromise and achieve a just\r\nand lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nMy delegation calls for conciliatory change in\r\nLebanon with the full implementation of resolution 425\r\n(1978) in order that Lebanon may fully enjoy its\r\nterritorial integrity, sovereignty and political\r\nindependence.\r\nSimilarly, my delegation believes that a concessional\r\nchange is necessary to find a solution to the situation in\r\nKosovo. My delegation calls on the parties to the\r\ninternecine conflict to enter into constructive dialogue on\r\na political solution that should include a substantially\r\ngreater degree of autonomy and meaningful self-\r\nadministration in the territory.\r\nThe issue of Taiwan has remained unchanged. China\r\nand Taiwan contribute significantly to the development of\r\nthe South Pacific region. My country is committed to a\r\none-China policy and enjoys very good relations with\r\nboth China and Taiwan. We therefore warmly welcome\r\nthe renewed talks between China and Taiwan and hope\r\nthat they will lead to profitable change on the Taiwan\r\nissue.\r\nLikewise, on the Korean peninsula, we urge South\r\nKorea and North Korea to continue their dialogue to\r\namicably resolve their common future.\r\nThe removal of tension and the resolution of\r\nremaining international disputes in East Asia are vitally\r\nimportant to the maintenance of peace and security in the\r\nentire Asia and Pacific region. For the Fiji Islands and\r\nother small island countries in the South Pacific,\r\npermanent peace in the wider Asia-Pacific region has a\r\ndirect bearing on our economic future.\r\nGiven my country’s commitment to global peace, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of the Fiji Islands strongly\r\ncondemns international terrorism in all its violent forms.\r\nIt is a scourge, and all States should treat it as such. My\r\ndelegation urges universal condemnation of such\r\nindiscriminate acts of violence, and we pledge to\r\ncooperate with all other members of the General\r\nAssembly in preventing such acts and in bringing those\r\nresponsible to justice.\r\nWe welcome the recent adoption at Rome of the\r\nstatute of the International Criminal Court, and we\r\nexpress our gratitude to the Italian Government for\r\nhosting the conference at which this took place.\r\nLast but not least, my delegation wishes to inform\r\nthe Assembly that a new Constitution of Fiji was\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\npromulgated on 27 July 1998. Pursuant to the coming into\r\nforce of the new Constitution, the name of our country has\r\nbeen changed to the Republic of the Fiji Islands. An\r\ninnovative feature of the new Constitution is that it makes\r\nprovision for the formation of a multi-party system of\r\nGovernment through representation in the Cabinet of all\r\npolitical parties that secure a certain number of seats in\r\nParliament.\r\nThe new Constitution also makes provision for the\r\nappointment of a Human Rights Commission and a\r\nConstitutional Offices Commission. The Government of the\r\nRepublic of the Fiji Islands considers the promulgation of\r\nthe new Constitution as laying the foundation for\r\nmeaningful change in our multiracial country. General\r\nelections under the new Constitution are due to be held next\r\nyear.\r\nChange is a paradox in international relations. If we\r\nare to fashion a new and better international community in\r\nwhich international democracy is to prevail and in which\r\nthe development and progress of all nations is to be\r\nengendered, we, collectively and in collaboration, have to\r\ninculcate change in the many issues which my delegation\r\nhas enumerated. We must make meaningful change in our\r\nworld an international imperative.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is His\r\nExcellency Mr. Boris Shikhmuradov, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan.\r\nMr. Shikhmuradov (Turkmenistan): First of all,\r\npermit me to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Uruguay, on his election to the post of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly. I would also like to\r\naddress words of gratitude to Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko\r\nfor the dynamic and competent manner in which he carried\r\nout his duties as President of the previous session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe have very attentively studied the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization and\r\nhave a very positive opinion of it. The quiet revolution\r\nbegun by the Secretary-General one year ago — the\r\ninstitutional reform of the United Nations — has become an\r\nirreversible process tied to the rapidly changing conditions\r\nof our new era. One of the major problems confronting the\r\ncommunity of nations is how to better understand emerging\r\nsocio-economic forces and the modalities of globalization,\r\nand how to channel them towards the fulfilment of our\r\nrequirements.\r\nActing within the framework of the United Nations,\r\nTurkmenistan is expanding the scope of its responsibilities\r\nwithin the world community of nations. I have the honour\r\nto inform the Assembly that yesterday, here at United\r\nNations Headquarters, Turkmenistan signed the Kyoto\r\nProtocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change. Furthermore, today, during my meeting\r\nwith the Secretary-General, I handed him the instrument\r\nof Turkmenistan’s accession to the Convention on the\r\nSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel,\r\nsigned by the President of Turkmenistan. Although we\r\nknow that accession by several countries more is still\r\nlacking for the Convention’s entry into force,\r\nTurkmenistan by its example would like to call on other\r\nStates Members of the Organization to join the\r\nConvention, adding their voices in its support — or rather\r\nin support of their citizens working for the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposal concerning real\r\npartnerships between the United Nations and multilateral\r\nregional organizations seems to be highly relevant,\r\nbecause regional organizations are especially effective in\r\nearly warning and preventive diplomacy, as well as in\r\nfinding optimal ways to carry out globalization.\r\nThe proposal on the establishment of a special unit\r\nto combat crime, terrorism, drug and weapons trafficking\r\nand money-laundering is very timely. A recent wave of\r\nterrorist acts around the world, including the bombings in\r\nTanzania and Kenya and the killing of Iranian diplomats\r\nin Afghanistan, requires consolidation of efforts by the\r\nworld community and decisive action. Turkmenistan\r\nresolutely fights against those negative phenomena and is\r\nprepared to contribute to the implementation of special\r\nUnited Nations programmes aimed at eradicating these\r\nevils.\r\nTurkmenistan welcomes the strengthening of the\r\nframework mechanism for interaction among all\r\norganizations of the United Nations system. I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to express on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Turkmenistan our gratitude to the\r\nmissions of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) and other United Nations agencies,\r\nthe positive results of whose work in Turkmenistan\r\ncannot be overestimated. Turkmenistan also expresses its\r\ngratitude to the donor countries supporting those\r\nprogrammes in our country.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nWe are gravely concerned about the continuing armed\r\nconflict in Afghanistan because it has a negative impact on\r\nthe stability of the region and on its economic development.\r\nIts impact also bears on Turkmenistan, which has one of\r\nthe longest borders with Afghanistan, stretching for nearly\r\n1,000 kilometres. Turkmenistan shares the opinion that\r\nthere is no alternative to a peaceful, negotiated settlement\r\nin that country and that violence gives birth to violence and\r\nwill only lead the process to a dead end. That is why we in\r\nTurkmenistan believe that the road to peace in that long-\r\nsuffering nation lies through political negotiations among all\r\nparties to the conflict under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. Turkmenistan fully supports the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, its Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and\r\nhis Special Envoy, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and joint steps\r\nundertaken within the framework of the 6 + 2 mechanism.\r\nTurkmenistan’s President, Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov,\r\nmaintains constant contacts regarding this matter with the\r\nSecretary-General and with the leaders of neighbouring\r\nStates. Turkmenistan will continue to cooperate closely with\r\nthe United Nations in this regard. Interaction among\r\nAfghanistan’s neighbouring countries, the United Nations,\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and all the\r\nparties concerned should lead to the termination of one of\r\nthe most protracted and violent conflicts of this century.\r\nIn view of the global changes that are taking place in\r\nthe sphere of international relations, Turkmenistan believes\r\nthat development of the Central Asian region objectively\r\ndeserves the attention of the world. The States of that\r\nregion have opened to the world a huge geopolitical and\r\ngeoeconomic potential, enormous natural wealth, and\r\ngeographical and transport opportunities. Turkmenistan is\r\nvigorously seeking alternative routes for delivery of its\r\nenergy resources to international markets. In developing a\r\nstrategy for the implementation of pipeline construction\r\nprojects, we have proceeded and continue to proceed on the\r\nbasis of various options. Pipeline infrastructure based on a\r\nvariety of options will ensure an increased volume and\r\ngreater diversification of energy deliveries, and will enable\r\nus to stabilize and guarantee their international distribution.\r\nThere is one more issue that I would like to dwell\r\nupon in this context. It concerns inter-State pipeline routes.\r\nThe problem of international pipeline routes can well be\r\ncompared to that of international sea straits, which was one\r\nof the most complex political and diplomatic challenges at\r\nthe turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Today\r\nsuch straits ensure freedom of navigation, including for\r\nlandlocked States. Their international legal recognition is\r\ncalled for by the economic and political interests of the\r\nworld community in developing mutual relations. The\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\r\nadopted in 1982, reaffirmed the importance of\r\nmaintaining freedom of navigation through straits and\r\npassages in archipelago waters and the need to do so.\r\nFreedom of navigation, which existed in the past as an\r\ninternational custom, was legally codified as one of the\r\nmost important principles of international law.\r\nIn this context, of great interest are modern problems\r\nrelating to the transportation of energy resources to\r\ninternational markets. It so happens that these enormous\r\nresources are located far away from the world markets.\r\nUsually it is landlocked nations that possess such\r\nresources, and the choice of delivery routes and the\r\nlocation of transnational pipelines has turned into a major\r\nproblem of our times. The resolution of this problem lies\r\nat the centre of the geopolitical and geoeconomic interests\r\nof the States that own the resources, the transit States and\r\nthe consumer countries.\r\nIn this respect, Turkmenistan promotes the initiative\r\nof security guarantees and unimpeded transit of energy\r\nresources along international pipelines. This initiative has\r\nalready been discussed with a number of State leaders, as\r\nwell as with the United Nations Secretary-General. We\r\nadvocate the establishment of an international legal\r\nmechanism designed to protect the interests of the\r\nproducers, transit countries and the consumers. It is\r\nnecessary to fully preclude the possibility of pipelines\r\nbeing used as a means of political pressure and economic\r\ndomination. The process of globalization in international\r\neconomic relations calls for the elaboration of an\r\ninternational convention that will govern the regime of\r\ninter-State pipelines and guarantee their functioning.\r\nTurkmenistan regards this matter as one of the most\r\nimportant challenges of the coming twenty-first century\r\nand is prepared to sponsor a document on this matter in\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nA change in the geopolitical situation has brought\r\nabout a new correlation of interests in the Caspian Sea\r\nregion, thus making it necessary to elaborate new\r\napproaches for the determination of the status of the\r\nCaspian Sea. The uncertainty that exists today with\r\nrespect to this issue hampers rational use of the enormous\r\npotential of the Sea by the littoral States. A majority of\r\nthe Caspian Sea States today favour the option of dividing\r\nthe Caspian Sea into different sectors. Turkmenistan also\r\nsupports this approach, just as it had previously supported\r\nthe concept of condominium.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nWhat is most important to us under either of the two\r\napproaches is that the interests of all littoral States should\r\nbe fully taken into consideration and that cooperation in the\r\nCaspian Sea region should be built on the basis of mutual\r\nrespect, equality and mutual benefit. The Caspian Sea\r\nshould be a sea of accord, and its wealth should be a\r\ncommon heritage of all littoral States, with each of them\r\nhaving a right to a corresponding national share of the sea.\r\nTurkmenistan believes that the search for a new legal status\r\nof the Caspian Sea, which would require all littoral States\r\nto look for reasonable compromises and display readiness\r\nto have an appropriate perception of new realities, should\r\nbe ensured by means of monitoring by the United Nations.\r\nToday the process of establishing a new international\r\nlegal status of the Caspian Sea confronts a number of\r\ndifficulties fraught with very negative consequences for\r\nregional stability. Under these conditions we consider that\r\nUnited Nations involvement would be highly appropriate.\r\nWe are happy to see that today there is a growing\r\ntendency towards restraint with respect to the attempts\r\naimed at associating extremism and other negative\r\nphenomena with the world of Islam. The Muslim world is\r\nmultifaceted and diverse. It faces a great range of universal\r\nand global problems of development. In this context, there\r\nemerges an objective need for mutual understanding and\r\ndialogue among various religious trends, a need for restraint\r\nand tolerance. The President of the United States, the\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Prime\r\nMinister of Turkey and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of\r\nGermany and Russia have expressed very wise and\r\npolitically promising ideas and statements during the current\r\nsession. In this respect, we find of great interest the idea\r\nvoiced by the President of Iran, Mr. Khatami, on declaring\r\nthe year 2001 the year of dialogue between civilizations.\r\nThe point is that the resolution of today’s global challenges\r\nis inconceivable without a meaningful dialogue, an\r\nexchange of opinions and a search for ways to resolve the\r\nmost pressing problems.\r\nIt is already three years since Turkmenistan began\r\npursuing its policy as a State of permanent neutrality.\r\nTurkmenistan’s neutrality is not a shell that protects it from\r\ndangers and tribulations of the outside world. On the\r\ncontrary, it is a position of strength that allows us to\r\nactively influence the situation in our region and the world\r\nas a whole and to develop effective international\r\ncooperation. We seek to maintain equal and equitable\r\nrelations with all nations, and our national interests are\r\npursued through economic openness and political\r\nimpartiality. Proceeding from this position, Turkmenistan\r\nattaches great importance to the United Nations role as a\r\nunique international institution in which all countries of\r\nour planet have equal access to international debate and\r\nthe resolution of problems that concern them.\r\nTurkmenistan believes that on the eve of the twenty-\r\nfirst century the United Nations should acquire additional\r\npowers and responsibilities, and strengthen its current\r\nones, by becoming a major factor in establishing a\r\nclimate of mutual respect and trust both in separate\r\nregions and the world as a whole.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall a proposal made\r\nby the Secretary-General regarding the holding of the\r\nGeneral Assembly session in the year 2000 in the form of\r\nthe Millennium Assembly. That Assembly would give all\r\nthe Member States of the United Nations a unique\r\nopportunity to take a look into the future, to ponder how\r\nthey perceive the United Nations of today and to\r\nspeculate on what kind of United Nations they will\r\nsupport in the next century.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is\r\nMr. Mustafa Osman Ismaiel, Minister for External\r\nRelations of the Sudan, to whom I give the floor.\r\nMr. Ismaiel (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at this\r\nsession. We are confident that his vast experience and\r\ncapabilities will lead this session to success. I would like\r\nto assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation.\r\nAllow me also to express our gratitude to his predecessor,\r\nthe former Foreign Minister of Ukraine, for his\r\ncommendable efforts and to express similar\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nand his able assistants for their efforts to ensure an\r\nimproved performance by the Organization, to bolster its\r\nstatus and to achieve its lofty objectives.\r\nThere are many questions in my country, in our\r\nArab and African region, and in the rest of the world.\r\nThere is a war raging between our neighbours on the\r\neastern and southern borders. All of these questions need\r\nto be debated.\r\nThe considerable improvement in the economic\r\nsituation in the Sudan is reflected in the latest\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) reports, which\r\nindicate an increase in the growth rate and a reduction in\r\nthe inflation rate. We expect the Sudan to become an oil-\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nexporting State in the next few months. This is an issue\r\nwhich we are very happy to brief you on.\r\nThere is also the constitutional evolution and political\r\nopenness in the Sudan, culminating in the approval by the\r\nSudanese people in a referendum of a new constitution\r\nearlier this year. This will enhance the institutions of civil\r\ngovernance and the peaceful transfer of power based on a\r\nsystem of political pluralism. These developments are\r\nimportant to political stability in Africa’s largest country,\r\nthe Sudan, a land of vast untapped resources.\r\nI also wish to talk about the humanitarian situation in\r\nthe Sudan and the improvements in that situation. Sudan\r\nappreciates the efforts of the international community and\r\nexpresses its full commitment to cooperate in the\r\nfacilitation of these efforts. This is a matter which deserves\r\nfurther elaboration.\r\nThere are also the peace efforts in southern Sudan and\r\nthe positive response of the Sudanese Government to the\r\ncalls for a ceasefire by the international community,\r\nincluding the Security Council, the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) and the European\r\nUnion. This ceasefire was rejected by the rebel movement,\r\nresulting in the continuation of war and more suffering for\r\nthe citizens. This also is a matter which requires further\r\nelaboration.\r\nAll these questions require more details, but I will\r\nleave that to other committees and forums, as I shall\r\nconcentrate today on one single issue: the American\r\naggression committed against my country on 20 August\r\n1998. This American act, if not properly addressed, could\r\nundermine all the achievements made by our people\r\nthrough years of struggle and suffering.\r\nIt would be appropriate to recall the events which\r\nbegan on 7 August. On that day the explosions took place\r\nin Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. That same evening the\r\nSudan condemned those heinous terrorist acts. We\r\nconveyed our condolences to the Presidents and the\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of the United States, Kenya\r\nand the United Republic of Tanzania. I also made telephone\r\ncalls to my Kenyan and Tanzanian colleagues expressing\r\nSudan’s fullest readiness to cooperate to the maximum\r\npossible extent in the efforts to search for, apprehend and\r\npunish the culprits.\r\nThe American Administration requested fly-over\r\npermission for their military aircraft in order to evacuate\r\nthe wounded and the dead from Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam,\r\nand their request was granted. That was followed by\r\nanother request for open fly-over permission for their\r\nmilitary aircraft, to which we responded promptly and in\r\ngood faith, as it was, in our view, a humanitarian request\r\nwhich deserved a response. Subsequently, contacts in this\r\nregard between the Sudanese and American security\r\nauthorities were begun. We welcomed these contacts and\r\ngave assurances of our full cooperation.\r\nBut, all of a sudden, within minutes and without\r\nwarning, the Sudanese people were shocked on the\r\nevening of Thursday, 20 August, by a grave act of\r\nterrorism, as heinous and cowardly as those of Dar-es-\r\nSalaam and Nairobi. The “Al-Shifa” pharmaceutical plant,\r\nwhich only a few hours before that event was producing\r\nlife-saving medicines for children, women and the elderly\r\nin the Sudan and which was a model of the economic\r\ndevelopment of my country, was completely destroyed.\r\nSome of the innocent Sudanese citizens, employees\r\nof the factory, lost their lives under the rubble, while\r\nothers lost their sight, or some of their limbs, or were left\r\nswimming in blood. Families of the victims and the rest\r\nof the employees were suddenly bereft of the sources of\r\ntheir livelihood.\r\nA few minutes later, we watched the message of the\r\nAmerican President on television, where he stated that the\r\nUnited States armed forces had launched air strikes\r\nagainst the Sudan and Afghanistan. He said that they had\r\ndestroyed a plant in the Sudan linked to Osama Bin\r\nLaden which produced chemical weapons.\r\nThis is the American perspective, which I have\r\nconveyed to you clearly. What then is the Sudanese\r\nperspective?\r\nI would like to state clearly and confidently that the\r\nfactory produced medicine — and nothing but medicine.\r\nThe plant belonged to the private sector. It was owned by\r\na Sudanese businessman, and it had no link whatsoever\r\nwith Osama Bin Laden. The factory was financed by the\r\nPTA Bank of the Common Market for Eastern and\r\nSouthern Africa (COMESA). It was one of the largest of\r\nits kind in the Middle East and Africa.\r\nIn his speech at the inaugural meeting of this session\r\nof the Assembly, President Clinton spoke about the\r\ntolerance and greatness of Islam. We appreciate what he\r\nsaid and would like to add that Islam calls for mutual\r\nrespect between civilizations, cultures and religions. Islam\r\ncalls for dialogue — indeed, all the revealed religions call\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nfor dialogue — and all of these religions abhor and\r\nrenounce violence and injustice, because injustice begets\r\nhatred.\r\nAll faiths call for justice. The principal rule of law\r\nstipulates that the accused is innocent until proven guilty.\r\nHowever, here we are faced with a situation in which the\r\nSudan was accused by the United States, the Sudan was\r\ncondemned by the United States and the Sudan was\r\npunished by the United States. Thus, the United States has\r\nacted as the adversary, the jury and the judge — the\r\nopponent and the arbiter. The whole world rejected the\r\nAmerican aggression and its justification.\r\nAllow me to mention here some of those who\r\nsupported our position in the Sudan: the Arab League, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement (NAM), the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), the Group of 77 and China, and large\r\nsectors of the American community, including former\r\nPresident Jimmy Carter, former Attorney-General Ramsey\r\nClark, a number of Congressmen and the American mass\r\nmedia. Our position was also supported by high-ranking\r\nofficials of Western countries, including presidents and\r\nforeign ministers, as well as by the British, Jordanian and\r\nAmerican engineers who took part in the construction and\r\noperation of the factory and who continued their technical\r\nassociation with it until it was destroyed. A number of legal\r\nexperts and lawyers from Western countries, as well as\r\ninternational trade unions and non-governmental\r\norganizations also voiced their support.\r\nIn spite of this, the United States continues to oppose\r\nthe dispatch of a fact-finding mission by the Security\r\nCouncil. The American officials claim that they analysed a\r\nsample of the soil near the factory and found that it\r\ncontained chemical precursors used in the production of\r\nVX — a nerve gas.\r\nIf they are so sure of what they found, we wonder\r\nwhy they object to the dispatch of a fact-finding mission by\r\nthe Security Council so that the Council can be the judge.\r\nThe factory has been destroyed, true; but the soil is still\r\nthere and the remnants and the rubble of the factory are\r\nthere. The fact-finding mission can easily collect soil\r\nsamples and examine the machines, look into the\r\ndocuments and establish the facts about the output and\r\nownership of the factory. This is the sole demand of the\r\nSudan now.\r\nLast week the Group of Arab States presented a draft\r\nresolution to the Security Council. The draft does not seek\r\nto condemn the United States for its violation of the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State. It\r\nonly requests the dispatch of a fact-finding mission to\r\nverify the allegations that were the basis of the decision\r\nby the United States to launch a strike against a medicine\r\nfactory in the Sudan.\r\nIt is the responsibility, indeed the obligation of the\r\nSecurity Council to do so. This is only a procedural\r\nmeasure to ascertain the facts — a procedure which the\r\nCouncil has always followed in similar situations.\r\nTherefore the Sudan and the entire international\r\ncommunity call on the Security Council to send an urgent\r\nfact-finding mission to the Sudan so that the international\r\ncommunity can verify the allegations upon which the\r\nUnited States based its decision to strike the medicine\r\nfactory.\r\nThe Sudan recognizes that sending a fact-finding\r\nmission is a legitimate request by a developing country\r\nthat holds dear the principles of international legitimacy\r\nand believes strongly that the fight against terrorism,\r\nwhich we condemn in all its forms, whether committed\r\nby individuals, groups or States, must be based on the\r\nprinciples and channels of international legitimacy and\r\ncooperation and the renunciation of force as a means for\r\nhegemony and domination.\r\nWe in the Sudan recognize that the United States is\r\na super-Power, and we do not seek to involve ourselves\r\nin a confrontation or altercation with that super-Power.\r\nOn the contrary, we are keen on establishing correct\r\nrelations with the United States on the basis of mutual\r\nrespect, common interest and constructive criticism. We\r\nare ready to engage in a dialogue with the United States\r\nand to cooperate with it on all issues of common concern.\r\nThe people of the Sudan respect the American\r\npeople and are eager to maintain good relations with\r\nthem. It is incumbent upon the two Governments to work\r\non reflecting this desire and to strengthen these historic\r\nrelations.\r\nWe have paid tribute to the countries that provided\r\nhumanitarian assistance to those affected by the war in\r\nsouthern Sudan, including the United States. However, we\r\nare perplexed by the provocative statement recently made\r\nby the spokesman of the American Administration when\r\nhe announced the donation of $25,000 to the victims of\r\nfloods in the Sudan. The statement claimed that despite\r\nits differences with the Government of the Sudan, the\r\nAmerican Administration is concerned about the welfare\r\nof the Sudanese people.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nThe American Administration launched 17 cruise\r\nmissiles to destroy the pharmaceutical factory. Each of\r\nthose missiles costs $1 million, for a total of $17 million to\r\ndestroy our factory. Now the United States announces its\r\ncontribution of $25,000 to the Sudanese victims of the\r\nfloods, while the damage caused by the floods is estimated\r\nto exceed $40 million. Had the American Administration\r\ngenuinely been concerned with the welfare and well-being\r\nof the Sudanese people, it would not have attacked and\r\ndestroyed one of our main economic entities, which\r\nproduced over 50 per cent of the essential and life-saving\r\nmedicines which the Sudan requires.\r\nTherefore, on behalf of the Sudanese people, we say\r\nto the American Administration, that we want our factory\r\nback, the factory we built with our toil and sweat and\r\nwhich cost us millions of dollars. We need the medicine of\r\nwhich our people were deprived as a result of the\r\ndestruction of the factory, particularly in this time of the\r\nflooding crisis which caused rampant diseases and\r\nepidemics, according to United Nations reports.\r\nAllow me now to briefly reflect on some of the\r\nconflicts that are taking place in our area, in view of their\r\ndirect impact on peace and security in the region.\r\nI start with our eastern borders, where the conflict\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea will undoubtedly lead to a\r\ndeterioration of the situation in the region. The Sudan,\r\nwhich still hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees from\r\nthe two neighbouring countries, is strongly affected by this\r\nconflict. Hence, from this rostrum we urge the two\r\nneighbouring countries to exercise self-restraint and to\r\nresort to peaceful means to settle their differences. We also\r\nhope that the efforts of the OAU will succeed in reaching\r\na peaceful settlement to this dispute.\r\nOn the other hand, we are following with great\r\nconcern the developments in our southern neighbour, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which is suffering from\r\nexternal interference in its internal affairs. We hope that the\r\nefforts of the African countries will be successful in\r\nassisting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo in maintaining peace and stability on its territory.\r\nAs regards the peace process in the Middle East,\r\nhopes for a final settlement have evaporated as a result of\r\nthe Israeli intransigence, which placed hurdles on the road\r\nto peace.\r\nThe Sudan welcomes the General Assembly resolution\r\nupgrading the Palestinian participation and supports the\r\nsteps taken by the Palestinian leadership to declare the state\r\nof Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital. The Sudan also\r\ndenounces the Israeli attempts to Judaize Jerusalem and\r\nchange its demographic composition and legal status.\r\nFurthermore, the Sudan supports the rights of Syria\r\nand Lebanon to regain their occupied territories in the\r\nGolan and in southern Lebanon, and it calls upon the\r\ninternational community and the Security Council to exert\r\npressure on Israel to implement the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and to heed the call for a just peace\r\nin order for the region to enjoy peace and security.\r\nThe embargo imposed on Iraq has lasted for too\r\nlong, and the suffering of the Iraqi people has deepened.\r\nThousands of women, children and elderly people have\r\nlost their lives because of the lack of food and medicine,\r\nand the world is wondering when the blockade will come\r\nto an end. The latest impasse between the United Nations\r\nSpecial Commission and Iraq could result in catastrophic\r\nconsequences in the area. This should prompt the Security\r\nCouncil to intervene by carrying out a comprehensive\r\nreview of Iraqi compliance with Security Council\r\nresolutions with a view to lifting the embargo. The Sudan\r\ncommends the efforts of the Secretary-General and\r\nexpresses the hope that these efforts will lead to a\r\nbreakthrough in the current impasse.\r\nThe Sudan also wishes to stress the importance of\r\nresolving the issue of the detainees and the missing\r\nKuwaitis as a humanitarian question, and it calls for\r\nredoubling regional and international efforts to settle this\r\nproblem so that the women and children who have waited\r\nso long can be reunited with their husbands and parents.\r\nThis would also eliminate the causes of tension and\r\nrestore solidarity and reconciliation between Arab nations\r\nand States.\r\nAs regards the issue of Lockerbie, we are very much\r\nconcerned with the embargo imposed on the sisterly\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, our neighbour. The damaging\r\nconsequences of this embargo have spilled over from\r\nLibya to the neighbouring countries, including the Sudan,\r\nwhich has hundreds of thousands of citizens living in the\r\nJamahiriya. It is a cause for sadness that scores of those\r\ncitizens have lost their lives while trying to cross the vast\r\ndesert between the two countries as a result of the air\r\nblockade imposed on the Jamahiriya. While welcoming\r\nthe recent positive developments in this issue, we stress\r\nthe need to provide the guarantees requested by the\r\nJamahiriya, as referred to by the President of Burkina\r\nFaso, the current Chairman of the OAU, in his statement\r\nbefore the Security Council last week.\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 September 1998\r\nConflicts in Africa have caused numerous difficulties,\r\nincluding the problems of refugees and displaced persons.\r\nAs a result, Africa has become host to the largest number\r\nof refugees in the world. Their number is estimated at more\r\nthan 8 million, and they live in the harshest conditions.\r\nIn its efforts to put an end to the suffering of\r\nrefugees and to find durable solutions to this problem, the\r\nOAU decided to convene the first ministerial meeting of\r\nthe Committee on Refugees and Disappeared Persons in\r\nKhartoum in December 1998 at the level of foreign\r\nminister. We in the Sudan look forward to the\r\ninternational community’s effective participation in and\r\nsupport for this conference in order to ensure its success.\r\nThe countries of the continent are hopeful that the\r\nconference will produce results which would assist in\r\ndealing with this long-standing problem.\r\nI should like to conclude with a verse from the Holy\r\nKoran:\r\n“God commands justice, the doing of good, and\r\nliberality to kith and kin. He forbids all shameful\r\ndeeds, and injustice and rebellion. He instructs you\r\nthat ye may receive admonition.” (The Holy Koran,\r\nXVI:90)\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.05 p.m.\r\n34\r\n"
