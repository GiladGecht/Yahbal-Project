(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Edison James, Prime\r\nMinister, Minister for External Affairs, Legal\r\nAffairs and Labour of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the Prime Minister,\r\nMinister for External Affairs, Legal Affairs and Labour of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Dominica.\r\nThe Honourable Edison James, Prime Minister,\r\nMinister for External Affairs, Legal Affairs and\r\nLabour of the Commonwealth of Dominica was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister, Minister\r\nfor External Affairs, Legal Affairs and Labour of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Edison C. James, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. James (Dominica): It is my distinct honour and\r\nprivilege to address this body once again. In doing so, may\r\nI take the opportunity to offer, on behalf of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, sincere congratulations to\r\nyou, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. My thanks are\r\nalso extended to Ambassador Udovenko, who so ably\r\nguided the fifty-second session.\r\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has been\r\nindefatigable in his efforts to bring about peace in various\r\ncountries and regions. To him we express our thanks and\r\ncongratulations. Last year, I extended an invitation to him\r\nto visit the Caribbean. He has not yet done so. The\r\ninvitation remains open.\r\nThe Caribbean region continues to demonstrate its\r\ncommitment to the democratic process. Since we last met\r\nin this forum the people of several of our States, within\r\nthe provisions of the existing rules, freely expressed their\r\nwill as to who should lead them into the new millennium.\r\nOur assertion that democracy is alive and well is not\r\na reflection that all is well in the region. The Charter of\r\nthis Organization imposes an obligation on all its\r\nMembers to work for the peace, security and economic\r\nand social development of all peoples of the world. As\r\nwe seek to discharge that obligation, it behoves us to be\r\nconstantly cognizant of those factors and events which\r\nwould militate against our success. Some of these are\r\nnatural and unavoidable; others are man-made and\r\nregrettable.\r\nThe Caribbean was only a few days ago severely\r\nimpacted upon by one such natural disaster, Hurricane\r\nGeorges. The damage inflicted was extensive, particularly\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nin St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Haiti and the\r\nDominican Republic. On their behalf, I urge this body to\r\ngenerously respond to their expressed need for assistance in\r\nthe reconstruction work. But the Charter obligations of the\r\nUnited Nations call for more than an ad hoc response\r\narrangement. We must first recognize the acute\r\nvulnerability of small States to natural disasters such as\r\nhurricanes, floods, volcanoes, earthquakes and so on, and\r\ntheir intrinsic limitations in mitigating and responding to\r\nthem.\r\nWhat is being proposed, therefore, is the establishment\r\nof a disaster reconstruction fund under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, the resources of which would be available\r\nfor quick and effective response to the needs of small\r\nStates post disaster. And there is still more that must be\r\ndone. Global warming and the greenhouse effect must be\r\nhalted.\r\nThere are on the agenda of this fifty-third session of\r\nthe General Assembly many matters of profound\r\nimportance to the Commonwealth of Dominica and the\r\nCaribbean Community as a whole. These include\r\nmacroeconomic policy questions on trade and development;\r\nthe revitalization of the economic growth and development\r\nof developing countries; the United Nations Decade for the\r\nEradication of Poverty; the protection of the global climate\r\nfor present and future generations of mankind; and\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity.\r\nThat cooperation is nowhere more necessary than in\r\nour fight to maintain the integrity of the market for our\r\nbananas. Our fight is against some very powerful members\r\nof this very United Nations, which seem determined to\r\nderail our democracy, upset our efforts to eradicate poverty\r\nand undermine the peace and security of our region.\r\nThe people of the Commonwealth of Dominica and\r\nthe people of the Caribbean Community look to the United\r\nNations to intervene on their behalf. The people of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica and the Caribbean Community\r\nare firm in their conviction that globalization and trade\r\nliberalization cannot be allowed to result in the\r\nmarginalization and economic disintegration of small\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nWe seek a level playing field on which our people can\r\nengage meaningfully in trade and development, rather than\r\nbe for ever subjected to the aid-and-dependency syndrome.\r\nOur expressed desire to hold on to our banana industry,\r\nwhich has served us well, in no way reflects any\r\nmisunderstanding of the reality of the current trade and\r\neconomic environment.\r\nWe in the Commonwealth of Dominica are actively\r\nengaged in the diversification of our economy, involving\r\nthe agricultural, tourism and service sectors. We have\r\nmade progress towards improving air access to our\r\ncountry and are providing increased opportunities for our\r\nchildren to receive secondary and tertiary education.\r\nWe consider the recent naming of one of our\r\nnational parks, Morne Trois Pitons, as a World Heritage\r\nsite to be a resounding statement of our commitment to\r\nthe preservation and effective utilization of our\r\nenvironment.\r\nIt is a source of comfort to us that all this has been\r\nachieved in an environment of social and political\r\nstability. We must, however, sound the warning bells, as\r\nwe note with great foreboding the practice by some of\r\ndeporting to our countries hardened criminals who have\r\nlearned and practised their trade in their adopted\r\nhomelands for several decades. In like manner, the\r\nunwarranted disruption and dismantling of families\r\nthrough inhumane immigration laws requires the attention\r\nof this Organization.\r\nI respectfully submit that in all our deliberations and\r\nactions, as indeed in every aspect of human endeavour,\r\nthe aspirations and legitimate expectations of the people\r\nmust be central. The 21.5 million people of the Republic\r\nof China on Taiwan aspire to be represented in this body.\r\nThey have a legitimate expectation that their country, a\r\nfounding Member of the United Nations, should have its\r\nmembership restored. We cannot but lend them our\r\nsupport. Ours must be a policy of inclusion.\r\nA cursory look at our agenda reveals 21 items\r\ndealing with the financing of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping or observer missions, all associated with\r\nwar, threats of war, “ethnic cleansing”, terrorism and the\r\nlike. This suggests that although much has been achieved,\r\nmuch more must be done. We must focus our attention on\r\nthe preservation of peace and security, thereby reducing\r\nthe need for the restoration of peace and security.\r\nThere should be no compromise in the fight against\r\nterrorism, whether it be in Kenya, Tanzania or Northern\r\nIreland. We note and are glad for the encouraging signs\r\nemanating from the Middle East. We should take our cue\r\nfrom the famous British politician who said “To jaw-jaw\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nis better than war-war”, and seek to settle our disputes\r\npeacefully in the spirit of our Charter.\r\nBy the time this fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly comes to a close, many speeches will have been\r\ndelivered from this podium, articulate, substantive speeches,\r\ndelivered by men and women who together hold and wield\r\nenormous power.\r\nThe peoples of the world have heard us talk. But is\r\nthat all they want from us? I submit that the answer is a\r\nresounding no. They want action. An agenda that includes\r\n165 items suggests that much work lies ahead of us. Yet I\r\npropose one additional task: that the Secretary-General and\r\nhis able team of professionals subject all of our speeches to\r\ndetailed scrutiny and analysis and, in keeping with the\r\ndirective of the Summit of the Americas, let us “put words\r\ninto deeds”.\r\nIn this way, we will give the lie to those critics who\r\nclaim this place is only a talk shop, and demonstrate to\r\nthem that it is indeed an action station.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity hold dearly to the principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. We are firmly committed to\r\nworking with all Members and nations to bring about an\r\nimproved quality of life for all the peoples of this world.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for External Affairs, Legal Affairs\r\nand Labour of the Commonwealth of Dominica for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Edison James, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for External Affairs, Legal Affairs and\r\nLabour of the Commonwealth of Dominica, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Foreign Trade of Jamaica, The Honourable\r\nSeymour Mullings.\r\nMr. Mullings (Jamaica): Let me begin by joining\r\nprevious speakers in extending my personal congratulations\r\nand those of my delegation to you, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. You assume the leadership of this Assembly at a\r\ntime when the global agenda demands much of us all. I\r\nassure you of the full support and cooperation of the\r\nJamaican delegation as you guide the work of this\r\nAssembly to what I am confident will be a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI wish also to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of\r\nUkraine for the effective manner in which he discharged\r\nhis responsibilities as President of the Assembly during\r\nhis tenure.\r\nThe Secretary-General deserves our praise for his\r\noutstanding leadership of the Organization during the past\r\nyear. I congratulate him in particular on the successes\r\nachieved through the quiet methods of preventive\r\ndiplomacy which he employed on sensitive issues\r\naffecting international peace and security.\r\nWe welcome his report, which contains a thoughtful\r\noverview of the complex challenges facing the\r\ninternational community, and we applaud the institutional\r\nreforms thus far introduced, which have sought to bring\r\ngreater coherence and efficiency to the work of the\r\nUnited Nations. We also endorse the reorganization of the\r\nwork programme, which brings renewed focus to the\r\ninitiatives of central importance to the United Nations:\r\nthose in the areas of peace and security, development\r\ncooperation, social development and humanitarian affairs.\r\nWe consider it essential that the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations support the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the implementation of this programme of\r\nwork. Such support should be extended not only by\r\nendorsement of the range of activities being undertaken in\r\nfulfilment of our mandates, but also through the regular\r\ncommitment of resources for their execution.\r\nOur presence here is an acknowledgement of the\r\nuniversality of many of the problems we face, and our\r\nmembership in this Organization is a demonstration of our\r\nconviction that these problems are best solved through\r\ncollective action. This should lead us to reaffirm our\r\nsupport for multilateralism and our respect for its\r\nprocesses through the timely payment, without\r\npreconditions, of our assessed contributions to the\r\nrespective United Nations bodies.\r\nIn recent years, the international community has\r\nwitnessed a disturbing increase in the number of conflicts\r\nwithin and between States. The stable peace anticipated\r\nat the end of the cold war has been elusive. Instead, we\r\nhave watched as efforts to resolve ongoing regional\r\ndisputes unravel because of obduracy, mistrust and\r\nhostility. We have watched as intolerance and hatred have\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\ndivided communities and fuelled conflicts across the\r\ncontinents. We are concerned that despite the intervention\r\nof the Secretary-General, his envoys and the membership of\r\nthe United Nations, there is still no real progress towards\r\npeace in a number of long-standing disputes.\r\nWe share the international community’s concern that\r\nthe peace process in the Middle East has been stalled, and\r\nwe are disappointed that there is still no substantial progress\r\non the long-standing problem in Cyprus. Hostilities in\r\nAfghanistan continue unabated, civil wars still rage in the\r\nSudan and Angola and violence in Kosovo has escalated.\r\nNew complications have arisen to increase instability and\r\nconflict in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.\r\nThese unresolved conflicts undermine the political,\r\neconomic and social fabric of the States concerned,\r\nbringing destruction and untold human suffering to the\r\nvictims of war. We cannot afford to drift into complacency\r\nwhile increasing numbers of the world’s people are\r\ndestroyed, dispossessed and despoiled by war. In the face\r\nof this, we should strengthen our resolve to stand against\r\naggression and the use of force, and to support the\r\nresolution of disputes and conflicts through negotiated\r\nsettlements.\r\nWe encourage Member States to support the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiative for strengthening the\r\ncapability of the United Nations to deal with conflict\r\nresolution, prevention and early warning. I also wish to use\r\nthis opportunity to commend the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping forces for the great contribution which they\r\ncontinue to make to the maintenance of peace,\r\nnotwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which they\r\nwork.\r\nWe are deeply distressed at the increasing acts of\r\nviolence directed against international peacekeeping\r\npersonnel. I wish to pay special tribute to these volunteers,\r\nsome of whom have given their lives, for their sacrifice in\r\nthe cause of peace.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations invests in the\r\nSecurity Council the principal authority for multilateral\r\ndecision-making in matters affecting international peace and\r\nsecurity. We are therefore concerned at the tendency of\r\nStates to take unilateral action which they deem to be in\r\ntheir national interest in situations of conflict with other\r\nnations. Jamaica reaffirms its confidence in the principle of\r\ncollective security, on which the role of the Security\r\nCouncil is predicated.\r\nIt is also important that the actions of the Council\r\ninspire confidence and that there be greater openness and\r\ntransparency in its working methods. We believe that, like\r\nany other international body, the Security Council should\r\nundergo a process of democratic reform if it is effectively\r\nto meet the new challenges of an ever changing world.\r\nWe are committed to working as equal partners with\r\nthe rest of the international community to strengthen the\r\ncapacity of the Security Council to respond to the needs\r\nof Member States in matters of peace and security. To\r\nthat end, my Government has presented its candidature\r\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Council for the period\r\n2000-2001.\r\nMy Government attaches importance to the fact that\r\nthe long awaited International Criminal Court, which the\r\nSecretary-General described as the missing link in the\r\ninternational legal system, has now been constituted by an\r\ninternationally agreed Statute. We commend the\r\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago for taking the\r\ninitiative in calling for its establishment. That institution\r\nwill provide a framework for the legal expression of\r\ninternational opposition to the terrible crimes being\r\nperpetrated against humanity which the United Nations\r\nhad not been able to address effectively.\r\nThis year the international community celebrates the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. As we commemorate this important\r\nmilestone, we should affirm our commitment to the ideals\r\nof tolerance, peace and understanding for all peoples. Let\r\nus also demonstrate mutual respect for each other’s right\r\nto self-determination, including the right to choose one’s\r\nown path for achieving national goals, and the right to\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThere can be no doubt that peace and security are\r\nprerequisites for the attainment of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It is equally true, however, that where there\r\nis economic and social deprivation, there can be no real\r\npeace.\r\nJamaica therefore strongly endorses the right to\r\ndevelopment as an integral part of fundamental human\r\nrights and underscores the important contribution which\r\nrealization of this right would make to the fuller\r\nenjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In\r\nthis regard, we welcome the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on progress being made in the elaboration of a\r\nstrategy for the implementation and promotion of the right\r\nto development.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nWe continue to look to the United Nations system for\r\nsupport of our development agenda, which goes beyond our\r\neffort to gain fair access to international markets and to\r\nsecure a just and equitable share of global prosperity.\r\nCentral to improving the welfare of our people must\r\nbe measures to alleviate and ultimately eradicate poverty\r\nand to promote environmental protection and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We need to strengthen our institutional\r\nframework for capacity-building and we need to invest in\r\ndevelopment of our human resources.\r\nThis is our people-centred vision for development, and\r\nwe recognize the need, if we are to make a reality of this\r\nvision, to continue to devise and implement public policies\r\nwhich ensure that the gains from economic growth and\r\ndevelopment are equitably distributed throughout society.\r\nThis challenge of good governance demands an\r\ninstitutional infrastructure that promotes transparency and\r\naccountability in public administration, ensures the effective\r\nmanagement of fiscal and monetary policies and protects\r\nthe integrity of judicial and law enforcement systems.\r\nA crucial component of our economic and social\r\ntransformation is the development of our human resources.\r\nJamaica supports the view that sustainable development\r\ncannot be achieved without sustained human development.\r\nIndeed, the pivotal importance of our human resources to\r\nthe development process was reaffirmed by the Caribbean\r\nCommunity member States in the Montego Bay Declaration\r\nadopted in 1997.\r\nWe in the Caribbean region stand firmly committed to,\r\nfirst, nurturingthe development of each person’s potential\r\nwithout regard to gender; secondly, developing a culture of\r\nentrepreneurship; thirdly, research and development as a\r\nway of life and a means of improving production; and\r\nfinally, improving the competitiveness of those industries\r\non which our economies are based. We look to the\r\ninternational community to support these aspirations.\r\nIn this regard, Jamaica welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposed initiatives to strengthen the international\r\nframework for human development. We agree that it would\r\nbe useful to convene global and regional seminars exploring\r\nways to advance human resource development and\r\ninstitution-building in preparation for the Millennium\r\nAssembly to be held in the year 2000.\r\nThe issue of sustainable development for small island\r\ndeveloping States is of particular importance to Jamaica. It\r\nspeaks to the very survival of a group of island States\r\nwhose economic viability and developmental aspirations\r\nare inextricably linked to the carrying capacity of the\r\nfragile ecosystems in which these nations make their\r\nhome. I speak of the ecologically vulnerable islands and\r\nlow-lying coastal States of the Caribbean, which are\r\ncontinually subject to the pressures of urbanization and\r\nresource exploitation, to the pollution of their coastal\r\nwaters and to the threat of natural disasters. We are\r\nendangered by the threat of sea-level rise and face the\r\ndestruction of our coral reefs.\r\nThe danger posed by natural disasters was most\r\nrecently demonstrated by hurricane Georges, which\r\nwreaked destruction through the Caribbean, causing\r\nwidespread loss of life and property in Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti\r\nand Saint Kitts and Nevis. We take this opportunity to\r\nappeal to the international community to provide urgent\r\nand generous humanitarian assistance and support for the\r\nreconstruction of our sister Caribbean States. Jamaica\r\nwelcomes the ongoing effort of the United Nations to\r\ndevelop economic and ecological vulnerability indices for\r\nsmall island developing States and will be monitoring\r\nclosely the outcome of this work.\r\nThe success of the small island developing States\r\ninitiative will depend on the negotiation of favourable\r\nagreements among national stakeholders and on the\r\nforging of effective partnerships with donor countries.\r\nJamaica therefore looks forward to the convening of the\r\nspecial session for the review of the Global Conference\r\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States in 1999, which provides an opportunity\r\nfor real progress to be made through the commitment of\r\nfinancial resources. What we need now is an action-\r\noriented follow-up programme to take our economies into\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nJamaica is a strong advocate of multilateralism and\r\nbelieves that measures available within the multilateral\r\nframework should be employed to assist developing\r\ncountries to benefit meaningfully from the process of\r\nglobalization. We note that while this process holds much\r\npromise for growth and prosperity, it also poses serious\r\nchallenges for developing countries, many of which are\r\nbeing increasingly marginalized. The reality is that the\r\nglobalization process is heightening patterns of uneven\r\ndevelopment among developed and developing countries,\r\nand it is already very clear that there is no globalization\r\nof benefits.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nThe plight of developing countries in the wake of the\r\nfinancial crisis currently affecting the global economy is\r\nmade even grimmer when we take into account the decline\r\nin concessionary financial flows from the donor community\r\nwhich we have witnessed in recent years. Official\r\ndevelopment assistance represents today only an average of\r\n0.22 per cent of the gross national product of developed\r\ncountries, a far cry from the target of 0.7 per cent set in\r\n1972. The share of official development assistance in net\r\nresource flows to developing countries fell from 64 per cent\r\nin 1994 to 22 per cent in 1996.\r\nTaken with the heavy burden of the debt-service\r\npayments which must be met, we are faced with the\r\nunhappy circumstance of net reverse flows from the South\r\nto the North at a time when additional resources are needed\r\nto address the challenges which attend the globalization\r\nprocess.\r\nThese trends must be reversed if developing countries\r\nare to have a fair opportunity to achieve meaningful\r\ndevelopment; for the success of the development process is\r\ndependent on the availability of external financing, and\r\nconcessionary resource flows play a significant role in the\r\nmaintenance of economic stability, the development of\r\ninfrastructure and capacity-building, which are prerequisites\r\nfor effective participation in the globalization process.\r\nJamaica considers that the time has come for us to\r\naddress these issues in serious dialogue. There is an urgent\r\nneed to identify ways in which development financing from\r\nindustrialized to developing and transition economies for\r\nboth public and private sector enterprise may be increased.\r\nWe must explore measures to relieve the external debt of\r\nthe developing countries, including the cancellation of debt.\r\nWe should seek to have dialogues between creditor and\r\ndebtor countries to ensure an increase in the flow of\r\nconcessionary financing in support of economic reforms,\r\npoverty eradication and the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe therefore join the call for the urgent convening of\r\na conference on financing for development at an early date.\r\nCrucial issues which we would wish to see discussed at\r\nsuch a meeting are strategies for mobilizing domestic\r\nresources for development; mobilization of international\r\nprivate financial flows; international financial cooperation\r\nfor development; debt relief; and trade facilitation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBeyond this proposed conference, my Government\r\nrecognizes that there is a need for ongoing exchange\r\nbetween the North and the South. While the days of the\r\nideological divide and political polarization are behind us,\r\nwe are still faced with the challenge of North-South\r\ndisparity in development and opportunity. We need to\r\nfoster increased collaboration between the developed and\r\nthe developing world to identify ways in which wider\r\ncooperation on issues concerning trade and investment,\r\ndebt and development may be pursued.\r\nWe consider that a process of dialogue on these\r\nissues could be initiated by a representative group of\r\ndeveloping and transition economies in consultation with\r\nthe major industrialized countries. We believe that such\r\na process of dialogue would pave the way for a broader\r\nframework of functional cooperation in areas of interest\r\nto both North and South.\r\nIt is with much satisfaction that Jamaica assumes the\r\nchairmanship of the Group of 15 developing States, and\r\nwe look forward to hosting the ninth ministerial meeting\r\nin Jamaica in February next year. Jamaica, during its\r\ntenure, will seek to ensure that developing countries play\r\na more active role in shaping the international economy\r\nso as to promote greater balance and equity.\r\nMy Government remains deeply concerned at the\r\never expanding illicit drug trade, which is not only a\r\nmenace to civil society, but also undermines the economic\r\nviability of our countries. The extraordinary demand for\r\nand supply of illicit drugs for this lucrative trade has\r\nresulted in the formation of transnational networks,\r\nincluding highly sophisticated money-laundering\r\noperations. Of even greater concern is the now well-\r\nestablished link between the drug trade and the\r\nproliferation of small arms. The ready availability of\r\nsmall arms has intensified the cycle of crime and violence\r\nin our societies.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly on the\r\nworld drug problem, held earlier this year, underscored\r\nthe need to strengthen the process of bilateral, regional\r\nand international cooperation in the fight against illicit\r\ndrug activities. These initiatives should also deal\r\nsimultaneously with the related problem of small arms.\r\nJamaica calls on the international community to fully\r\nsupport these efforts.\r\nJamaica joins in condemning the acts of terrorism\r\ncommitted in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi during August.\r\nWe support the adoption of a multilateral approach as the\r\nmost effective means of removing this threat to the\r\nsecurity of the international community.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nCaribbean States recognize the ocean as a symbol of\r\nthe common heritage of mankind, a vital resource which\r\nshould be managed in a responsible manner so as to ensure\r\nits continued use for present and future generations.\r\nCaribbean Governments are committed to the protection of\r\nthe Caribbean Sea, our shared patrimony. We have recently\r\ntaken a decision to develop and implement a comprehensive\r\ncoastal zone management programme by the year 2000. We\r\ncontinue to be concerned at the threat tothe fragile marine\r\nenvironment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and\r\nother hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea.\r\nJamaica commends the Government of Portugal for its\r\ninitiative in establishing the Independent World\r\nCommission on the Oceans, on which an eminent Jamaican\r\nserves. As part of its recognition of the International Year\r\nof the Ocean, the Government of Jamaica has established\r\na National Council on Ocean and Coastal Zone\r\nManagement to promote the sustainable development and\r\nuse of our marine resources.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority, which has its\r\nheadquarters in Kingston, continues to make progress on\r\nthe negotiation of a mining code. It is hoped that these\r\nnegotiations will be finalized at an early date, so that a\r\nregulatory regime for the resources of the seabed may be\r\nfirmly established. We call on Member States to participate\r\nmore actively in these negotiations in order to ensure that\r\nthe code which is developed will protect the interests of all\r\ncountries. We also urge Member States to support the\r\noperation of the Authority through the commitment of\r\nresources.\r\nIt has not escaped our attention that many of the\r\npreceding speakers have made reference to the need for the\r\npromotion of international peace, human security and\r\nsustainable development. As we move forward towards the\r\nend of an era, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that\r\nwe do not face the dawn of the new millennium burdened\r\nby the weight of unresolved issues which impede the\r\ndevelopment of our community of nations and which\r\nundermine the well-being of our peoples.\r\nClearly, it is in our individual and collective interest\r\nto participate fully in the process for development and\r\npeace, for, after all, the character of the global village of\r\nthe future will ultimately be determined by the quality of\r\nthe input that each of us invests today.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bhutan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jigmi Yoser Thinley, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Thinley (Bhutan): It is with great pleasure that\r\nI congratulate you, Mr. President, on your unanimous\r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at this\r\nsession. This session is particularly significant because we\r\nare celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. It is also important for a\r\nless uplifting reason: during this session the international\r\ncommunity is confronted with serious challenges and is\r\nhard pressed to find collective wisdom to deal with\r\ndisturbing developments and trends. As you guide us in\r\nour deliberations on these issues, I wish you well and\r\nwould like to extend to you the full support of my\r\ndelegation. I also wish to join the preceding speakers, all\r\nof whom have justly praised the excellent work done by\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko.\r\nOur Secretary-General stated in his address to the\r\nrecent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement that\r\n“human rights are not simply a matter of civil and\r\npolitical freedom. Genuine freedom of choice\r\nrequires economic, social and cultural emancipation\r\ntoo.”\r\nFrom the very beginning of our development process and\r\nto ensure such emancipation, Bhutan has been guided by\r\na philosophy of maintaining a harmonious balance\r\nbetween material and spiritual prosperity. This we believe\r\nis the way forward to attaining our goal of gross national\r\nhappiness.\r\nI have the pleasure to inform the Assembly that the\r\nthrone of the Kingdom of Bhutan has always been the\r\nfountainhead of the many changes in our country which\r\nhave led to greater empowerment of the people. Just three\r\nmonths ago our King introduced, through the National\r\nAssembly, some profound changes in the governance of\r\nour country. These changes are in addition to the earlier\r\ninstitutionalization of participatory decision making\r\nprocesses at the district and grass-roots levels. Upon\r\ndissolution of the appointed Cabinet, a new Council of\r\nMinisters has been elected for a specific term by the\r\nNational Assembly. His Majesty the King has voluntarily\r\nrelinquished his role as the head of Government and was\r\nfurther successful in convincing the National Assembly to\r\nintroduce a mechanism for the removal of a reigning\r\nmonarch through a periodic vote of confidence. Such\r\nongoing changes have further strengthened the rule of law\r\nand have enhanced even further the direct participation of\r\nthe people in development and governance.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nAs we stand at the threshold of another millennium of\r\nhuman civilization, our generation of leaders and policy\r\nmakers must not fail to grasp the unprecedented\r\nopportunities. Ours is the past and ours, too, is the future.\r\nEven as we are engaged in the last defining moments of the\r\ntwentieth century, we have a decisive role in shaping the\r\nbeginning of the next thousand years. We cannot undermine\r\nour own role. Narrow interests and differences must not be\r\nallowed to deter us from the greater legacy we owe to\r\nposterity.\r\nI believe that we should look upon all the challenges\r\nthat have spiralled in recent years as a last reminder of the\r\ngrowing vulnerabilities of human society. There is the\r\nAsian crisis, which now threatens to cause global economic\r\ncontraction and is already undermining the social and\r\npolitical stability of some nations. The environment is\r\nwreaking havoc in many quarters of the world, causing loss\r\nof life and property in both the richest and the poorest\r\ncountries. And just as trade, technology and the reality of\r\ninterdependence force us to abide with each other in a\r\nworld that is shrinking in space and natural resources, we\r\nfind ourselves torn apart by bigotry, intolerance and hate.\r\nTerrorism is on the rise, our children are lured by drugs\r\nand crime, and even the richest nations among us can ill\r\nafford the rising cost of growing prison populations. Then,\r\nthere is the spectre of a nuclear holocaust, which continues\r\nto haunt us. Unless we look at our future and manage the\r\ncompelling forces of globalization with a greater sense of\r\nspirituality and social concern, I fear that the global village\r\nwill fail to provide much of that elusive state of joy and\r\ncontentment to which we all aspire.\r\nTerrorism in all its manifestations is unjustifiable,\r\nregardless of the cause it seeks to espouse. It must be\r\ncondemned in the strongest of terms. Those who use terror\r\nor the threat of terror target innocent people. Their\r\nobjectives are clear: to foster an environment of fear if their\r\ngoals are not met. Such heinous crimes against humanity\r\nmust not go unpunished. The voices of those who live in\r\nconstant fear of having the most fundamental of human\r\nrights — the right to live without fear and the right to life\r\nitself — abused and violated can no longer be ignored. The\r\nconclusion and effective implementation of a\r\ncomprehensive international convention on terrorism\r\ntherefore assumes great significance.\r\nThe recent nuclear tests in South Asia have aroused\r\nmuch concern. However, we are heartened by the positive\r\nsteps being taken by the concerned parties to calm the fears\r\nof the international community. As a small, peace-loving\r\ncountry, Bhutan has always condemned nuclear armament\r\nand advocated full and comprehensive elimination of all\r\nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Our\r\ndelegation urges all participants in the disarmament\r\nprocesses to undertake a more realistic assessment of the\r\nprevailing global security arrangement, which, we believe,\r\nhas the inherent weakness of enticing States to join an\r\nexclusive club. Unless there is an accelerated process\r\ntowards complete and comprehensive denuclearization\r\nbeyond the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) and beyond the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the world must be prepared to\r\nface the eventuality of a nuclear club that will lose its\r\nexclusivity.\r\nMr. Kastrup (Germany), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nActive and not passive interdependence is the\r\nprimary condition for all human progress in the future. It\r\nis clear that prosperity in one part of the global village\r\ncannot be sustained when poverty prevails in the other.\r\nYet unconscionable levels of disparity continue to grow\r\nbetween the rich and the poor countries. While one\r\nsection of human society is burying itself in the waste of\r\nconspicuous and excessive consumption, the other is\r\nplagued by hunger and exposure. Against this backdrop,\r\nit is sad to note that shrinkage of official development\r\nassistance remains a serious concern. Political will must\r\nbe generated to reverse this trend and to inject new\r\nvitality into international cooperation for development in\r\nthe interest of shared and sustainable prosperity.\r\nRevitalization and reform of our Organization has\r\nbeen the singular underlying theme of recent sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly. We are all agreed on the need for\r\nmajor changes if the United Nations is to effectively meet\r\nthe current and emerging challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. As we continue to assess the long-term\r\nimplications of the Secretary-General’s proposal contained\r\nin his report, we should bear in mind the needs and\r\naspirations of small and developing countries, which\r\ncomprise the overwhelming majority of the United\r\nNations membership.\r\nEfforts should also focus on further strengthening of\r\nthe role and capacity of the Organization in the promotion\r\nof development. In this regard, we welcome the inter-\r\nagency collaborative arrangements, which we feel have\r\nalready led to improved coordination and cost-\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations development agencies.\r\nIn so saying, I should like to place on record the deep\r\ngratitude of the people of Bhutan for the vital role and\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\ncontributions of the various United Nations agencies in our\r\ncountry’s development efforts. These agencies often play a\r\nlead and coordinating role in such sectors of our national\r\ndevelopment programmes as health, education and\r\ninfrastructure. Indeed, it is the face of the United Nations\r\nas a prime mover of development that the masses in many\r\nof our countries most appreciate and cherish.\r\nDifferences in perspective have prevented us from\r\narriving at a meaningful agreement on substantive issues\r\nconcerning the reform of the Security Council. Sixty-five\r\nlengthy meetings held by the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the question of Security Council expansion and reform\r\nhave yielded few results, and tangible proposals remain\r\nelusive.\r\nMy country firmly supports the position of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement on this matter, as reiterated in the Final\r\nDocument of its twelfth Summit meeting, which was\r\nconvened in South Africa earlier this month. Bhutan is of\r\nthe view that the current permanent members have an\r\nobligation to be more responsive to calls for multifaceted\r\nreforms of the Council. It must be rendered more effective\r\nand transparent through democratization and the\r\nenlargement of its membership, both in the permanent and\r\nnon-permanent categories. New permanent members must\r\ninclude countries that have the capacity to share greater\r\ninternational responsibilities and reflect equitable\r\ngeographical representation. We believe that Japan, whose\r\napportionment of the United Nations regular budget will\r\nexceed 20 per cent by the year 2000, and India as a\r\ndeveloping country which represents one sixth of humanity,\r\nare two countries that deserve permanent membership in the\r\nSecurity Council. We remain convinced that the presence\r\nof developing countries is all the more essential for the\r\nreason that they form the object of most actions of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nBefore I conclude, my delegation wishes to express its\r\ndeep sadness over the loss of human life and destruction of\r\nproperty and infrastructure in the aftermath of the worst\r\never floods in Bangladesh. While the people of Bangladesh\r\nbattle against this cruel act of nature, the people of Bhutan\r\nare one with them and have extended to them some\r\nassistance. As a least developed country, Bangladesh does\r\nnot have the resources to alleviate the suffering of its\r\npeople and to put itself on the road to recovery and\r\nnormalization. We are hopeful that the international\r\ncommunity will respond promptly and generously to the\r\nappeal of the Prime Minister and the Government of\r\nBangladesh.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs of Cameroon, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, on whom\r\nI now call.\r\nMr. Kontchou Kouomegni (Cameroon)\r\n(interpretation from French): Allow me first of all, Sir, to\r\nconvey, on behalf of my delegation, my warmest and\r\nmost heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-third session. His election is a tribute to his country,\r\nUruguay, a country with which Cameroon shares many\r\ncommon ideals. It is also a mark of our confidence in his\r\nqualities as a diplomat and lawyer of renown. He can rest\r\nassured of the full cooperation of the delegation of\r\nCameroon in successfully discharging his important duty.\r\nI also pay a warm tribute to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the former Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ukraine, who discharged with effectiveness and\r\nauthority the delicate and high-profile mission with which\r\nhe was entrusted.\r\nFinally, I renew the firm support of my country,\r\nCameroon, for the work undertaken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, at the head of\r\nthe Secretariat of our Organization since his election. He\r\nhas resolutely and effectively tackled the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations with discretion, tact and realism, so as to\r\nmake it capable of meeting the challenges facing it.\r\nAt a time of globalization and information\r\nsuperhighways, it is more urgent and necessary than ever\r\nto place the development and dignity of humankind at the\r\ncentre of our concerns. We must also acknowledge that\r\nthe tremendous technological advances at the end of this\r\ncentury justify high hopes of a better tomorrow.\r\nBy working for the right to development for both\r\npresent and future generations, by charting new and more\r\nsecure paths in the quest for peace, by watching over\r\ninternational security more effectively than in the past,\r\nour Organization is, at this delicate period in history,\r\nhelping to ease the anguish of humankind in an\r\ninternational environment that is increasingly complex,\r\nunequal and disquieting.\r\nIn this context, the current session of the General\r\nAssembly gains greater prominence and importance\r\nbecause it coincides with two fiftieth anniversaries: that\r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that of\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nthe start of peacekeeping operations. Those two events will\r\nform the basis of my remarks.\r\nWith regard to the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, the first words of the preamble retain, 50 years\r\nlater, striking relevance. It states:\r\n“recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal\r\nand inalienable rights of all members of the human\r\nfamily is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace\r\nin the world”.\r\nHuman rights are, first and foremost, a question of\r\ndignity: dignity for every human being; dignity for all of\r\nhumankind. We believe that this search for dignity, which\r\nis a condition for peace, justice and freedom in the world,\r\nis the common ideal towards which all human rights actions\r\nand activities should be aimed.\r\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary is a\r\ntrue rallying call to us and should provide the international\r\ncommunity with an opportunity to refocus its approach to\r\nhuman rights questions, which remains very simplistic.\r\nIndeed, too often we forget that civil and political rights,\r\nwhich exercise the international community so much, can\r\nbe fully developed only if economic, social and cultural\r\nrights are also guaranteed. Recent experiences of\r\ndemocratization processes in Africa remind us, by their\r\nvery fragility, of the incontrovertible indivisibility,\r\nuniversality and interdependence of human rights.\r\nTo paraphrase the words the head of State of\r\nCameroon, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, spoke at the\r\nWorld Food Summit in Rome, what dignity can there be for\r\nthe hungry? The international community must therefore\r\ngive equal priority to the promotion of the right to a\r\nminimum standard of living.\r\nIn a world in which the globalization of trade, instead\r\nof placing human beings at the centre of its concerns,\r\nmerely means speculation, market manipulation and deals\r\nthat generate the greatest profits, making the rich richer and\r\nreducing the poorest to destitution, the social environment\r\nitself is the cause of tension and conflict. That is why we\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his report (A/52/871),\r\nsubmitted to the Security Council as document S/1998/318\r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa.\r\nIn this context, it is apt that, in seeking to establish a\r\ntrue culture of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the\r\ninternational community has chosen the central theme of the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary to be “human\r\nrights for all”.\r\nPoverty is today the most serious threat to human\r\ndignity. This is particularly true in Africa, which is the\r\nleast advanced region and the one most seriously affected\r\nby the economic crisis. Despite the reforms that have\r\ntaken place, at enormous social cost, to promote good\r\ngovernance, democracy and the liberalization of\r\neconomies, meeting basic needs remains for many a\r\nluxury in that continent. Whether we are talking about\r\naccess to drinking water, primary health care, or\r\neducation or about transport or other communication\r\ninfrastructures, international cooperation has not yet borne\r\nfruit in a reliable, continuing, predictable and effective\r\nway.\r\nOfficial development assistance, which elsewhere has\r\nhelped to give rise to decent standards of living, is\r\ndwindling drastically. Despite the increasingly favourable\r\njuridical environment offered by Africa, investors seem to\r\nbe losing interest in the region. The debt burden is getting\r\nworse. Our products do not have easy access to\r\ninternational markets, nor are they priced according to\r\ntheir true value.\r\nIt is clear that the marginalization of Africa seems\r\ninevitable unless a true spirit of solidarity quickly\r\nprovides real long-term solutions. It is time for the\r\nvarious initiatives, plans of action and other programmes\r\nadopted to benefit Africa to be translated into reality.\r\nBasing itself on the efforts made by the peoples of Africa,\r\nthe international community must increase its assistance\r\nto that continent so as to enable Africans themselves to\r\nmake the progress that is indispensable for developing\r\ntheir potential. In that way African countries will be able\r\nsuccessfully to integrate themselves into world economic\r\nnetworks and achieve the development to which they\r\nlegitimately aspire, despite the well-known geographical\r\nand historical handicaps. Such a development would\r\ninevitably benefit all of humankind.\r\nThis solidarity should take the specific form of\r\nreconsideration — indeed, the cancelling — of the debts\r\nof African countries. We should recall that decisions to\r\ncancel debt in the past have enabled countries in difficult\r\nand precarious situations to rediscover the road to\r\neconomic prosperity, democracy and greater political\r\nstability.\r\nThe path thus seems clearly laid out for the rich\r\ncountries that are working to promote freedom and human\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nrights. They should reflect, at the dawn of the third\r\nmillennium, on their relations with developing countries\r\nthat are becoming poorer because of their deep\r\nindebtedness.\r\nNorth-South solidarity should also be reflected in a\r\nnew concept of official development assistance. Such\r\nassistance is indispensable for establishing development\r\ninfrastructure within the context of poverty eradication.\r\nPrivate flows, channelled through non-governmental\r\norganizations, cannot alone take on that role. Furthermore,\r\nstructural adjustment should aim to strengthen and improve\r\nthe autonomous management capacity of countries in\r\ndifficulty. Otherwise, globalization will mean that certain\r\ncountries become richer while others become poorer. That\r\nwould render meaningless the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights and put in grave danger the requirement of\r\ndignity for every human being, for all people and for peace\r\nin the world.\r\nIndeed, what freedom or self-determination — and\r\nespecially, what sovereignty — can there be for a starving\r\npeople? What democracy can there be for a people\r\nsuffering from malnutrition, with no access to basic health\r\ncare, drinking water or elementary education. We thus need\r\nto return the human being to the centre of development.\r\nCameroon has constantly contributed to this lofty\r\nendeavour.\r\nThe salient activities we have undertaken to mark the\r\nfiftieth anniversary in my country include informing people\r\nabout human rights and making all of society aware of\r\nhuman rights issues through media campaigns, seminars,\r\nconferences and poster campaigns throughout our land,\r\neven in villages; the introduction of human rights teaching\r\nin schools and universities; issuing special postage stamps;\r\npromoting in particular the rights of women, children and\r\ndisabled or infirm people, establishing a prize for the best\r\nresearch in the human rights area; and the opening by the\r\nhead of State of a public square dedicated to human rights.\r\nBut above and beyond commemorating the\r\nanniversary, Cameroon has for a decade been making\r\nimportant progress in promoting human rights. It did so\r\nfirst through a series of legislative and regulatory measures\r\nthat, inter alia, abolished legal exemptions, restored\r\nindividual and collective freedoms, put an end to censorship\r\nand ensured better protection for the interests of workers\r\nand vulnerable social sectors.\r\nThrough constitutional revision and a progressive\r\nelectoral system, we have established total adherence to the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and ensured the\r\nfull participation of our people in making political\r\nchoices. Furthermore, a national committee for human\r\nrights and freedoms was established in 1990, which is\r\nfreely carrying out its activities throughout the country, as\r\nare the many non-governmental organizations and human\r\nrights groups that have come into being.\r\nWith regard to progress made in the world since the\r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nand the efforts that remain to be made in this area, there\r\nis no doubt that the promotion of and respect for human\r\nrights are a difficult, ongoing endeavour. Vigilance must\r\ntherefore be our watchword, and the struggle for human\r\nrights should not flag in any region of the world.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to ensure that\r\nhuman rights are fully enjoyed by all the peoples of the\r\nworld. To that end, the letter and spirit of the Universal\r\nDeclaration should gradually be adapted to changing\r\nmores and to science and technology. Bodies that are\r\nabove the fray of ideologies and interests should ensure\r\nthat it is observed, including through a system of regional\r\nand international human rights courts.\r\nWith regard to the fiftieth anniversary of\r\npeacekeeping operations, we wish to pay tribute to the\r\nwork done by the United Nations, which has always made\r\nits presence felt wherever peace has been threatened.\r\nThanks to the Blue Helmets, the United Nations is present\r\nin all the world’s trouble spots, keeping the peace.\r\nIt is true that some voices have been heard here and\r\nthere deploring their sluggishness, hesitation and, in some\r\ncases the inaction. Sometimes the presence of a United\r\nNations force or mission has not been able to prevent\r\nlarge-scale massacres or crimes against humanity,\r\nperpetrated in violation of the most elementary rules of\r\nhumanitarian law. Such limits to the actions of our\r\nOrganization remind us in a very timely manner that the\r\nUnited Nations can act only within the limits of the\r\nmeans made available to it by the Member States. It is up\r\nto Member States, therefore, to provide it with the\r\nnecessary resources to enable it to respond fully to the\r\nmission entrusted to it by the peoples of the United\r\nNations.\r\nDespite these limits, we must acknowledge in a\r\npositive spirit that over the years many peacekeeping\r\noperations and other actions taken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral have made it possible to prevent the emergence,\r\naggravation or continuation of many conflicts.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nThanks to the Blue Helmets, millions of human lives\r\nhave been saved, and sometimes the United Nations has\r\npaid a heavy price for this total commitment to the cause of\r\npeace. The recent tragic death of Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye\r\nand his team, to whose memory I wish to reaffirm the\r\nfraternal homage of the people of Cameroon, is one more\r\nparticularly unhappy example of this point.\r\nBy ensuring the safety of peoples, the delivery of\r\nhumanitarian aid and respect for ceasefire agreements and\r\nby performing an increasing number of administrative tasks,\r\nthe Blue Helmets are helping restore confidence and\r\nprevent loss of life and the disintegration of certain States.\r\nSuch commitments and sacrifices deserve all our\r\nencouragement.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of peacekeeping operations\r\nshould provide us with an opportunity to think about\r\nquestions relating to their continuation: problems of\r\nfinancing, the safety of personnel involved in the\r\noperations, the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations and\r\nethical issues.\r\nWith regard to the ethical issues, Cameroon believes\r\nthat it is time to formulate a code of conduct so that people\r\nparticipating in peacekeeping operations can remain, above\r\nall, protectors of human rights as well as true beneficiaries\r\nof them. Given the many tasks expected of these\r\noperations, it would be appropriate to review their range,\r\ntheir scope and the modalities governing them.\r\nEven now, as we congratulate the United Nations on\r\nits work for peace, conflicts are still destroying lives,\r\ntearing apart families and communities and placing at risk\r\nthe future of young generations throughout the world. The\r\nreports of the Security Council and of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, which we receive on a regular basis, are\r\nparticularly important in this respect.\r\nThe resurgence of terrorism is another element of the\r\npicture, as we were recently reminded by the deadly attacks\r\nagainst the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-\r\nSalaam and the attack in Omagh. Cameroon, a peaceful,\r\njustice-loving country, strongly condemns these unfortunate\r\nevents that show that we need to redouble our efforts to put\r\nan end to mindless violence.\r\nThis means that we must silence weapons, prevent\r\ndisputes and above all create the conditions for true peace.\r\nThat does not mean merely the absence of armed\r\nconflict, but living together in harmony, with the entire\r\ninternational community and all nations building together\r\na society that respects individual and collective freedoms.\r\nWe need to begin by recognizing and accepting\r\ndifferences as a source of richness and dynamism. We\r\nneed to practise tolerance and dialogue, the latter not just\r\nbetween the citizens of one nation but also between\r\nStates, in order to build a more fraternal and democratic\r\nsociety.\r\nThis means in particular that we must opt to settle\r\ndisputes through peaceful means and that States must turn\r\nwhenever necessary to the International Court of Justice\r\nas the judicial organ of the United Nations and the\r\nessential cog not only in the machinery for peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, but also within the general system\r\nof peacekeeping and international security established by\r\nthe Charter.\r\nAt the end of the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law, the call has become urgent for States\r\nto demonstrate themselves psychologically prepared to\r\nseek recourse naturally to the International Court of\r\nJustice and the political bodies of the United Nations and\r\nthose of regional organizations. This is Cameroon’s\r\nconviction, as well as that of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich in resolution 3232 (XXIX), paragraph 6, reaffirmed\r\nthat,\r\n“recourse to judicial settlement of legal disputes,\r\nparticularly referral to the International Court of\r\nJustice, should not be considered an unfriendly act\r\nbetween States.”\r\nThat is why Cameroon went to the International\r\nCourt of Justice at The Hague with regard to its dispute\r\nwith Nigeria over territorial and maritime boundaries. In\r\nthis context, I should like to take this opportunity to make\r\nan urgent appeal to the international community, and\r\nespecially to the United Nations, to help keep the peace\r\nbetween our two countries before, during and after the\r\nCourt’s verdict.\r\nSilencing weapons is a good thing; eliminating their\r\nuse through prevention and — why not? — through\r\ndisarmament is even better. That is why we must not rest\r\nuntil all weapons of mass destruction are eradicated, be\r\nthey of a nuclear, chemical, biological or other nature.\r\nIt must be pointed out here that another danger has\r\nappeared in certain subregions of Africa — namely, the\r\nproliferation of small arms and their illicit circulation.\r\nThis phenomenon is already a threat to peace and should\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nbe quickly contained because it can sow the seeds of\r\nconflict.\r\nThe conclusions of the recent seminar organized by\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat in Yaoundé from 27 to 31\r\nJuly 1998 within the framework of the Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa are\r\nparticularly illustrative in that regard. I would like to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General and donor countries for their support\r\nof the activities of that Committee. We know that we can\r\ncontinue to count on their support in implementing the\r\nrecommendations of that seminar, especially in continuing\r\nthe Committee’s activities. That institution is called on to\r\nplay a crucial role in mobilizing the countries of central\r\nAfrica to take responsibility for the security of their\r\nsubregion under the aegis of the United Nations.\r\nAlso with regard to prevention, the recent creation in\r\nRome of the International Criminal Court is a timely\r\naddition to the mechanisms that protect human rights and\r\nmaintain peace. The International Criminal Court will in\r\neffect be responsible for prosecuting and punishing persons\r\nguilty of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity\r\nand the crime of aggression. Cameroon is pleased to have\r\nbeen one of the first signatories to its Statute and hopes that\r\nall States will become parties to it. To this end, it is urgent\r\nthat the crime of aggression be rapidly and clearly defined.\r\nThis would abolish the impunity of aggressors and prove to\r\nthe peoples of the world our real determination to put an\r\nend to war once and for all.\r\nIn the context of this general debate, I have\r\ndeliberately chosen, as the Assembly has seen, not to touch\r\non most current problems, particularly ongoing crises. I\r\nwanted to concentrate on certain permanent essential values\r\nthat lie at the basis of the two observances I mentioned,\r\nwhose violation causes most of the misfortune in our world\r\ntoday. I refer to the human persons’s right to dignity and\r\nfulfilment, the right to development and the right to\r\npeace — in short, the right to life. The United Nations is\r\nthe guarantor of their observance and promotion.\r\nFor Africa, the recent report of the Secretary-General,\r\nwhich should act as a kind of compass for all of us, lays\r\ndown the foundations for all those committed to working\r\nfor the prosperity of our peoples. In reality, all regions of\r\nthe world need this kind of wake-up call and this kind of\r\nreport. We are accountable to future generations for making\r\nthese values a reality.\r\nLet us not disappoint. Let us not allow people to be\r\nleft along the side of the road. It is up to us to do\r\neverything possible so that these humane values remain a\r\nconstant concern of the United Nations and of its\r\nspecialized agencies.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq, His Excellency\r\nMr. Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf.\r\nMr. Al-Sahaf (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-third session. I am fully confident that his experience\r\nand skill will ensure the success of the work of this\r\nsession.\r\nThe world continues to labour under events that attest\r\nto the inability of the international community to avert the\r\neffects of international transformations which carry within\r\nthem the elements of tension and conflict, given the\r\nimbalance at the international level caused by a unipolar\r\nsystem wherein a sole dominant player in the international\r\narena seeks to impose its hegemony on the international\r\ncommunity. That sole player is not concerned except with\r\nits selfish and narrow interests, and with imposing its\r\ndominance over international institutions and\r\norganizations. As a result, the United Nations faces a\r\nserious challenge represented by the degree of its ability\r\nto regain the balance required of it in order to accomplish\r\nits objectives as set forth in the Charter.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations witnesses\r\nattempts to reform its structures and work mechanism to\r\nmake it compatible with the current political and\r\neconomic realities. Most important is the effort to reform\r\nthe working methods of the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council in order to bring the work of these two\r\norgans into full harmony with the evolution of\r\ninternational relations and with the increased membership\r\nof the international Organization. This evolution requires\r\nequitable representation of States from the various\r\ncontinents on the Security Council, whether through\r\npermanent or non-permanent membership. The success of\r\nthese efforts depends largely on the serious political will\r\nof Member States of our Organization. The reform of the\r\nwork of the Security Council is urgently needed, if we are\r\nto end control over it by a few States and transform it\r\ninto an institution which truly represents international\r\nrealities. Without these reforms, it is impossible to\r\nachieve the purposes and the principles of the Charter\r\nwith regard to the maintenance of peace and security,\r\npromoting economic and social development and\r\nstrengthening cooperation among people.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nInternational peace and security are affected by the\r\nirrational and biased character of the way issues of\r\ndisarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, are\r\naddressed. There are States which maintain huge arsenals\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear,\r\nchemical, biological or long-range missiles, while other\r\nStates are being disarmed or called upon to disarm\r\nthemselves under all sorts of pretexts. The proper approach\r\nin this regard is in the comprehensive implementation of\r\nthe relevant international treaties and comprehensive\r\nagreements, free of selectivity and discrimination. Then,\r\nand only then, can the goal of general and complete\r\ndisarmament be put to the service of the cause of peace and\r\nsecurity in the world and of ensuring the legitimate rights\r\nof States to defend their security and independence in a just\r\nand equitable manner.\r\nThe Middle East region is witnessing today a grave\r\nsituation and serious impairment of the balance of powers.\r\nThe Zionist entity possesses a huge arsenal of weapons of\r\nmass destruction of all types — nuclear in particular,\r\nchemical, biological or long-range missiles — in disregard\r\nof the General Assembly’s efforts to render the Middle East\r\na zone free of weapons from mass destruction; of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 487 (1981), which demands that the\r\nZionist entity place its installations under the\r\ncomprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency; and of paragraph 14 of Security Council\r\nresolution 687 (1991), which states that the actions to be\r\ntaken towards Iraq represent steps towards the goal of\r\nestablishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons of\r\nmass destruction. This situation, resulting from the Zionist\r\nentity’s failure to comply with these resolutions, threatens\r\nsecurity and peace in the region and in the entire world,\r\nand encourages an arms race in the region.\r\nIraq strongly affirms its support for the struggle of the\r\nPalestinian people against Zionist settler colonialism in\r\nPalestine. It supports the struggle of the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization for the realization of its legitimate objectives,\r\nendorsed by the international community, which affirms the\r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinians in Palestine, including\r\nits capital, Al-Quds al-Sharif.\r\nThe comprehensive, inhumane blockade imposed on\r\nIraq has entered its ninth year. This blockade has caused\r\nand continues to cause the death of thousands of Iraqi\r\ncitizens every month due to the lack of medicine and food\r\nand a grave deterioration in the infrastructures of the\r\nindustrial, agricultural, health, education, service sectors and\r\nother areas. This situation calls for the strong condemnation\r\nof those who insist, for ulterior political motives, on\r\ncontinuing to inflict on the Iraqi people this destructive\r\nblockade, the tragic consequences of which are\r\ntantamount to internationally proscribed acts of genocide.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991) contains two\r\nsets of obligations: those which must be fulfilled by Iraq,\r\nand those that require the Security Council to lift the\r\nblockade on Iraq when Iraq has met its obligations.\r\nThe obligations imposed on Iraq concern\r\ndisarmament. Briefly, they require the destruction,\r\nremoval or rendering harmless, under the supervision of\r\nthe United Nations Special Commission and the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, of all weapons of\r\nmass destruction which were in Iraq’s possession. They\r\nenjoin Iraq to refrain from the production, possession,\r\nstockpiling, use or development of such weapons in the\r\nareas prohibited by resolution 687 (1991), which are the\r\nballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres\r\nand chemical and biological weapons, together with the\r\nnuclear programme. These obligations imposed on Iraq\r\nalso provide for the establishment of a system of ongoing\r\nmonitoring, verification and registration of compliance.\r\nIn return for the achievement of the above, with\r\nregard to the elimination of the prohibited weapons,\r\nparagraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991) provides that the\r\nprohibition against the import of basic commodities and\r\nproducts originating in Iraq and the prohibition against\r\nfinancial transactions related thereto contained in Council\r\nresolution 661 (1990) shall cease to remain in effect.\r\nThroughout the past seven and one-half years, Iraq\r\nhas fully cooperated with the Security Council, the\r\nSpecial Commission and the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency. Iraq has met all the conditions and obligations\r\nimposed on it as an expression of its good will and in\r\norder to have the blockade imposed on its people lifted.\r\nAll prohibited weapons have been destroyed over the\r\npast seven and one-half years, together with hundreds of\r\nplants, installations and equipment related to those\r\nweapons. The operations were carried out with so much\r\nvengefulness that they even included cooling and lighting\r\nequipment, as well furnishings and other items that had\r\nnothing to do with the prohibited weapons or with their\r\nproduction. Since 1994, the Special Commission and the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency have established a\r\ncomprehensive system of strict monitoring.\r\nHowever, although Iraq has fully implemented all\r\nthe requirements of resolution 687 (1991) concerning\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\ndisarmament, the Security Council has not taken any action\r\nto implement its own obligations towards Iraq, as\r\nprescribed by paragraph 22 of that same resolution.\r\nQuestions which must be legitimately addressed to the\r\nSecurity Council are: why should Iraq bear all these\r\nburdens and losses while the blockade continues and no one\r\nknows when it is going to be lifted? Why has the Security\r\nCouncil been unable so far to discharge its obligations\r\ntowards Iraq?\r\nIraq has cooperated throughout the past seven and one\r\nhalf years with the Security Council, the Special\r\nCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nand has met all the requirements of the Security Council’s\r\nresolutions in the hope that its cooperation would lead to\r\nlifting the blockade imposed on the people of Iraq.\r\nHowever, the blockade has not yet been lifted, thus\r\nrendering the continuation of cooperation both meaningless\r\nand useless.\r\nThe Special Commission entrusted with pursuing the\r\nimplementation of Iraq’s obligations under the provisions of\r\nresolution 687 (1991), which concerns disarmament and\r\ndirects the monitoring system established since 1994,\r\nrefrains — I repeat, refrains — from reporting the facts\r\nabout Iraq’s compliance with its obligations under Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. The reason for its failure to do so is\r\npolitical. The Special Commission and its Chairman operate\r\nunder the influence of an arrogant, powerful State that is\r\npursuing ulterior political aims against Iraq that have no\r\nrelevance whatsoever to Security Council resolutions on\r\nIraq.\r\nFor political reasons, the Special Commission and its\r\nChairman refrain from reporting to the Council that Iraq is\r\ntotally free of all weapons prohibited under resolution 687\r\n(1991) in the three areas of missiles and chemical and\r\nbiological weapons, even though the Special Commission\r\nhas no concrete evidence to prove the opposite. The Special\r\nCommission and its Chairman both refrain from reporting\r\nto the Council that all the plants, equipment and\r\ninstallations which the Commission itself determined had\r\nanything to do with those weapons have been destroyed and\r\nthat the remaining plants, equipment and installations\r\ncapable of so-called dual-use are totally under a\r\ncomprehensive and strict monitoring system. Accordingly,\r\nIraq is incapable of resuming the production of such\r\nweapons. Finally, the Special Commission and its Chairman\r\nrefrain, also for political reasons, from reporting to the\r\nCouncil that since the establishment of the monitoring\r\nsystem in 1994 the Commission has not noted any violation\r\non the part of Iraq with regard to resuming the production\r\nof the prohibited weapons.\r\nThis prejudiced position on the part of the Special\r\nCommission and its Chairman has brought action to a\r\ndead end and into an unacceptable vicious circle. Iraq was\r\ntherefore obliged to suspend cooperation with the Special\r\nCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nbecause insisting on dead-end paths and vicious circles\r\ncan only lead to the continuation of the blockade on the\r\npeople of Iraq, which is unacceptable and even contrary\r\nto resolution 687 (1991).\r\nIn order to seek a way out of this deadlock and\r\nbreak out of the vicious circle created by the Special\r\nCommission and its Chairman, Iraq has welcomed the\r\nproposal for a comprehensive review submitted by the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to the Security\r\nCouncil last 6 August. Iraq has emphasized that such a\r\ncomprehensive review is a legal and moral obligation\r\nwhich the Council is duty-bound to discharge. By the\r\nterms of resolution 687 (1991), the Council is required to\r\nimplement paragraph 22, relating to lifting the\r\nprohibitions against the import of basic commodities and\r\nproducts originating in Iraq, based upon the completion\r\nby Iraq of all actions contemplated in part C of the\r\nresolution. The Council is also required to undertake a\r\nreview every 60 days aimed at either reducing or lifting\r\nthe embargo in the light of the implementation by Iraq of\r\nall its obligations under the relevant Council resolutions.\r\nHowever, the 40 reviews carried out so far have been a\r\nmere formality, arbitrary and far from comprehensive.\r\nThus, embarking upon a real comprehensive review\r\nin accordance with the Secretary-General’s proposal is not\r\na reward given to Iraq, but a duty that the Security\r\nCouncil has to undertake under its own resolutions. Iraq\r\nhas expressed its willingness to participate effectively in\r\nsuch a comprehensive review — it is one of its\r\ninalienable rights. Iraq has also expressed its hope that\r\nsuch a comprehensive review of what it has accomplished\r\nin terms of disarmament under part C of resolution 687\r\n(1991) will be made as soon as possible and without\r\nfurther delay. It is our hope that it will be indeed\r\ncomprehensive, fair and honest and that Iraq will be given\r\nevery possible opportunity to submit its point of view on\r\nall relevant questions that might be posed by the Special\r\nCommission, the IAEA or members of the Security\r\nCouncil. Iraq also hopes that the review will be conducted\r\nunder the personal supervision of the Secretary-General\r\nand that Mr. Annan will see to it that such a\r\ncomprehensive review is bound by a clearly defined\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\ntimetable and not allow it to be an aimless process without\r\nforeseeable end.\r\nWhile we support carrying out such a comprehensive\r\nreview in an objective, fair and impartial manner, we affirm\r\nIraq’s right to expect the Security Council to proceed to\r\ntake action to lift the inhumane sanctions that have been\r\nimposed on the people of Iraq for eight years now. The\r\npeople and leadership of Iraq will accept no less.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Worship of Bolivia,\r\nMr. Javier Murillo, to whom I give the floor.\r\nMr. Murillo de la Rocha (Bolivia) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): The election of the Foreign Minister of\r\nUruguay as President of this session of the General\r\nAssembly is a source of great pride to Latin America. It is\r\nalso a fitting tribute to Mr. Opertti, whose diplomatic\r\nexperience and skills augur well for the success of this\r\nfifty-third session.\r\nJust when it seemed that we had secured stability,\r\nsigns of a severe crisis reappeared in the horizon. Indeed,\r\ncommodity prices have declined on average by 30 per cent,\r\nreaching their lowest levels in the last three decades in real\r\nterms. Consequently, exports from Latin America to\r\ndeveloped countries, consisting primarily of raw materials,\r\nhave begun to shrink, and trade balance deficits in the\r\nregion have increased proportionately.\r\nThere has been a decline in growth of output in Latin\r\nAmerica. Businesses are reducing production volume,\r\npaying less tax and going further into debt with the banks.\r\nThere is a proportionate decline in domestic savings and\r\ninvestment in infrastructure, in the training of human\r\nresources and in the production of goods and services.\r\nVisible unemployment is on the rise, and shadow economic\r\nactivities are gaining ground.\r\nThis brief account — no less grim for its brevity —\r\nof the current situation points to a dangerous recession in\r\nAsia and Latin America.\r\nOf course, the fact that this turbulence began about a\r\nyear ago in Asia, halfway round the world, before reaching\r\nthe Andes, reveals the extent to which the world economic\r\nsystem has become interdependent. Both the scale and the\r\nconsequences of this interdependence would have been\r\ninconceivable until recently. The planet has indeed become\r\nthe global village which was to be the sign of the future, as\r\nwe had all heard.\r\nBut there is an ugly and unfair side to globalization\r\nthat I wish to stress. Countries — and when I use the\r\nword, I do not just mean abstract entities, but actual\r\npeople with spiritual and material needs — are not paying\r\nonly for their own mistakes but also for the economic\r\npolicy errors and negligence of others.\r\nLet me take my own country as an example. A small\r\ncountry, with enormous structural limitations, it made a\r\ngigantic effort, at enormous cost and at the price of\r\nenormous sacrifices, to put its accounts and institutional\r\nstructure in order. Bolivia overcame hyper-inflation,\r\nrestored its macroeconomic balance and made progress in\r\nfirst- and second-generation structural reforms. We\r\nestablished a democratic system which, while not perfect,\r\nis being studied in our region as a model of political\r\ncooperation and social dialogue. We are prepared to\r\ncommit all our energies to casting off the historic chains\r\nof corruption and poverty.\r\nThis entire effort, just now beginning to be\r\nproductive, may be thwarted by causes that are beyond\r\nour control and for which we bear no responsibility. It is\r\ntrue that our progress may not have been sufficiently\r\nrapid and that our economic and social structures are still\r\nweak, but the crisis we face today does not stem from\r\nthese deficiencies.\r\nBolivia and other countries will have to foot the bill\r\nfor the mistakes of others, for far distant trivialities. We\r\nare suffering, the analysts tell us, from the contagion of\r\nthe Asian crisis, and we would do well to pray harder to\r\nprevent anything happening in our own country or\r\nanywhere in the broad region surrounding us.\r\nMy country did what it had to do and did it well. No\r\none wants to go back to the past. No right-thinking\r\nBolivian wants for a moment to return to the days of\r\nauthoritarianism, hyper-inflation or the bureaucratic state.\r\nNo, this is not what it is all about. But nor is it about\r\nacting as if nothing had happened — as if all that was\r\nnecessary to overcome this crisis was to take a stronger\r\ndose of the same medicine. That would be an\r\nunforgivable mistake.\r\nThe current situation has revealed such shortcomings\r\nin the international system, particularly with regard to\r\ninternational financial flows, that it would not make sense\r\nto keep things as they are. Next month there will be a\r\nmeeting of the Ministers of Finance of the Group of\r\nSeven — the nexus of world economic power — to\r\ndecide our fate. I do not know if our voice will be heard,\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nbut I do believe that this Assembly of the peoples of the\r\nworld is itself a message that can at least remind them of\r\na few things.\r\nThere is a need for prompt and concerted action on\r\nthe part of the advanced and developing countries to\r\ndiminish the volatility of financial markets and to provide\r\nsome discipline and procedures for incentives and penalties\r\naimed at remedying the major shortcomings in these\r\nmarkets. There must be an increase in the availability of\r\npublic financial resources in the International Monetary\r\nFund and other institutions to compensate promptly and\r\nefficiently for damage caused by unduly heightened risk in\r\nany given country or by the wanton recklessness of\r\nspeculators on the world’s stock markets.\r\nThere must be a discussion very soon about the nature\r\nand the new role of the International Monetary Fund and\r\nthe World Bank and of the necessary adjustments thereto,\r\nbecause these bodies were created in a context quite\r\ndifferent from that of today and clearly have been\r\noverwhelmed by the events of recent years, which could not\r\nbe prevented. Their structure, their resources, their\r\nphilosophy and their modus operandi were severely\r\ncriticized since the 1980s in Latin America and in the\r\nAssembly, and today they have shown themselves to be\r\nunable to contain the impact of the current crisis. We have\r\nglobalized the crises of poverty and unemployment. Let us\r\nalso globalize the commitment to solve them.\r\nBy virtue of the universal nature of this body, by\r\nvirtue of the terms of the Charter of San Francisco and\r\nbecause it is here that the concerns and problems of the\r\nStates Members of this supreme world Organization should\r\nbe set forth, I must once again raise what is well known as\r\nBolivia’s maritime problem.\r\nAlmost 120 years ago, in a military confrontation not\r\nof its own making, Bolivia lost a long strip of coastline on\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. Our country thus lost, temporarily, its\r\nmaritime status, its sovereign access to the sea — an\r\nessential condition of its existence — as well as its\r\ngeopolitical role and status as a bridge between the great\r\nbasins of South America.\r\nThe economic damage wrought by this loss was\r\nimmense. I will not take time here today to mention the\r\nvalue of the minerals and fishing resources of this territory,\r\nas it is incalculable. Suffice it to recall that recent studies\r\nhave shown that the cost of the landlocked condition of my\r\ncountry is estimated at $4 billion every 10 years, an amount\r\nequal to that of our foreign debt.\r\nHowever, perhaps the most serious consequence of\r\nthis ill-fated event was that my country was condemned\r\nto be penned in behind the Andes, far removed from the\r\nmainstream of the passage of goods, peoples and cultures,\r\nwhich are the very lifelines of the development of\r\nnations. Therefore, ever mindful of the magnitude of the\r\ndamage, my country never accepted this status of\r\nisolation imposed upon us. We have unceasingly called\r\nfor this injustice to be redressed, but in doing so we have\r\nabided by our tradition as peaceful people that rejects\r\nconflicts. However, our voices never fell silent.\r\nWe sought bilateral negotiations with Chile and\r\nbrought our case to international forums.\r\nOn various occasions, the bilateral negotiations\r\nconcluded with agreements or concrete proposals for a\r\nsolution whose main objective was the return to Bolivia\r\nof its sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean, with a\r\ncoastline, a port of its own and an overland link. For\r\nreasons that I shall not go into now, these dealings were\r\nnever concluded and were added to the long list of lost\r\nopportunities on the record of relations between our\r\ncountries.\r\nBolivia’s cause has always been met with the\r\nsympathy and understanding of the international\r\ncommunity. There have been numerous expressions of\r\nsuch solidarity. I would just like to refer to two, one in\r\nthe framework of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nother in that of the Organization of American States\r\n(OAS). I will state only the relevant portion of the\r\nresolution adopted by the ninth General Assembly of the\r\nOrganization of American States, which was held in La\r\nPaz in 1979. That resolution states, in its operative part\r\nthat,\r\n“it is in the inherent interest of our hemisphere to\r\nfind an equitable solution whereby Bolivia can\r\nobtain sovereign and effective access to the Pacific\r\nOcean”\r\nas part of a proposal aimed at,\r\n“securing, in a spirit of fraternity and integration of\r\nthe Americas, the objective referred to in the\r\nprevious paragraph and to consolidate a stable peace\r\nwhich would stimulate economic and social progress\r\nin the region of the Americas directly affected by\r\nthe consequences of Bolivia’s landlocked condition.”\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nIn spite of everything, the problem still awaits a\r\nsolution. It is a kind of throwback to another time, another\r\nlogic, another way of seeing relations between neighbouring\r\nnations. This has left an indelible mark on the memory of\r\nmy country. I must therefore state emphatically before the\r\nAssembly that Bolivia will never back down from its\r\ndemand and that it will not be discouraged by how long its\r\nefforts may take. Bolivia has the staying power and\r\nlimitless patience of an ancient people and knows that the\r\ntime is sure to come when this long-standing issue will be\r\ndefinitively resolved. Our hope becomes conviction when\r\nwe see how other nations find ways of unravelling the\r\nGordian knot of conflicts at least as complex as our own.\r\nThe case made by President Hugo Banzer last year in\r\nthe Assembly is still valid. He recently put it again to the\r\ntwelfth presidential summit of the Rio Group in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n“There is no subject which cannot be discussed, if it\r\nis approached in good faith, without preconceptions or\r\nprejudices. The subjects of peace, security and\r\ndemocracy are not items reserved for diplomats and\r\nspecialists. All the institutions of society have an\r\nopinion to voice and ideas to contribute. These are\r\nvoices which must be heard and heeded. I would\r\ntherefore like to propose that wherever there is open\r\nconflict between our nations or where the embers of\r\nancient conflicts still smoulder, let us call upon our\r\ncitizens to help us find the path to solutions. Let us\r\nthrow open the windows of Latin American diplomacy\r\nand let in the fresh air of new opinions and the sound\r\nof new voices. Only recently I made the same point\r\nby suggesting that Bolivians and Chileans meet\r\ntogether and talk about the vast potential of our\r\nrelationship and find a way of removing the obstacles\r\nwhich block its path. I am repeating this here today,\r\nbecause I am convinced that we must find a way of\r\nbreaking with the status quo. We cannot bind\r\nourselves to the inheritance of other times and other\r\nproblems.”\r\nIt could not be clearer that now is the time for\r\neconomic integration and a political solution for access to\r\nthe ocean, not for confrontations. The nature of the global\r\nsystem requires the formation of large-scale spaces in\r\nwhich ideas and goods can move freely, where common\r\ninstitutions can be built and where new cultures can be\r\nnurtured, the fruit of the mingling of diverse peoples. If this\r\nis true anywhere, it is true in Latin America.\r\nIn order to clear the path along these major\r\nhighways, we must remove the obstacles that are blocking\r\nor hindering the march towards integration. In the case of\r\nrelations between Bolivia and Chile, this means resolving\r\nthe age-old disputes which led to the breaking off of\r\ndiplomatic relations at the end of the 1970s. The\r\nliberalization of trade, agreements on economic\r\ncomplementarity and arrangements for free transit are all\r\nessential parts of this picture, but not the whole picture.\r\nFor this to happen, what is needed is vision and\r\ncourage on both sides. If we want to find new, different\r\nsolutions in keeping with the times, we can no longer\r\nremain mired in the juridical, diplomatic and military\r\nlogic of the past. If we want to find answers, we may\r\nhave to move outside those circles that have traditionally\r\nhandled these matters up to now. This is the sense of the\r\nproposal of President Banzer: to bring businessmen,\r\nworkers, churches, professionals and the peoples of\r\nBolivia and Chile into the dialogue.\r\nOf course, the international community has a crucial\r\nrole to play in the search for agreement. The counsel,\r\nguidance and help of friendly countries within the\r\nframework of the subregional integration processes in\r\nwhich they are engaged may just be the missing factor\r\nneeded to get dialogue going, to bring diplomats to the\r\nnegotiating table, to make leaders shoulder their historical\r\nresponsibilities and to reach a solution bringing our\r\npeoples together. My country is convinced that the\r\nunderlying problems must be dealt with because we know\r\nthat integration will be consolidated only when economic\r\nagreements guarantee that it will be sustained by the\r\npolitical will and confidence of our nations.\r\nThere are many initiatives that should not be left\r\nonly on paper. Last June, during the special session\r\ndevoted to the drug problem, important proposals were\r\nmade. Bolivia put forth the idea of creating a body,\r\nsimilar to a consultative group, made up of countries that\r\nwould help finance the high cost of the fight against drug-\r\ntrafficking. We would like to know what steps have been\r\ntaken to implement this, as well as the other initiatives\r\nthat were proposed in that highly important specialized\r\nforum.\r\nThe phenomenon of corruption, which is no stranger\r\nto most countries represented here, is a disease that\r\nspreads and damages our institutional structures, saps the\r\nlegitimacy of democracy, distorts the economy, creates\r\nbad habits in public administration and erodes morality.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nIn compliance with a presidential order, last 21\r\nSeptember we had the honour of celebrating at a solemn\r\nceremony the signing of an accord among the principal\r\ninstitutions of the State representing the three branches of\r\npower, whereby the National Integrity Plan came into\r\neffect. This Plan establishes a comprehensive strategy to\r\ncombat corruption. The judicial basis for the Plan is taken\r\nfrom the Inter-American Convention against Corruption,\r\nwhich was signed by the member States of the OAS in\r\n1996 and which Bolivia was the first nation to ratify as the\r\nlaw of the land.\r\nAfter careful thought, we have made this policy one\r\nof the highest priorities of the Government of Bolivia. We\r\nhave begun to put into effect the first concrete measures to\r\ncombat this evil and to make this proposal State policy. We\r\nnow invite the international community to follow our\r\nendeavour closely and to support our initiative.\r\nBolivia vigorously adheres to all the statements that\r\nhave repudiated terrorism, a despicable practice that has no\r\njustification whatsoever. It will support any initiative or\r\naction that may be put forth to fight it.\r\nIn another area, we wish to underline the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s task in the process of the reform of the United\r\nNations. We believe that there has been progress in the\r\nefforts to reduce bureaucracy, rationalize expenses and\r\navoid duplication in the work of the United Nations. We\r\nalso believe that it would be healthy to enhance the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in order to turn it into an\r\neconomic, social, scientific and technological council. It\r\nwould also be worthwhile to create a council for\r\nhumanitarian affairs responsible for social problems of our\r\ntime, such as poverty, unemployment, discrimination and all\r\nforms of exclusion.\r\nWe meet every year to express our concerns and\r\nthoughts, to share experiences and reaffirm our faith in the\r\npurposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter. Each\r\nyear, we would like to see positive advances in the solution\r\nof problems, in joint responses to crises, in the spread of\r\npeace on the world map. Thus, the United Nations will\r\ncontinue to grow even stronger. Bolivia wishes, as always,\r\nto contribute to the achievement of those goals.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Tajikistan, His Excellency Mr. Talbak\r\nNazarov.\r\nMr. Nazarov (Tajikistan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): First allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the crucial post of President of the General\r\nAssembly and to wish you success in guiding the work of\r\nthis important forum.\r\nThe example of Tajikistan clearly demonstrates the\r\nfruitfulness of close cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations in peacekeeping\r\nactivities and highlights the need for the international\r\ncommunity to implement a coordinated strategy to support\r\nthe efforts of the Government and people of a country to\r\nresolve crises, overcome instability and find ways to\r\nachieve lasting peace, national reconciliation and\r\nprosperity. We welcome the key role played by the\r\nUnited Nations in coordinating this multifaceted work.\r\nI would like once again to express my profound\r\ngratitude to all Members of the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council and to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for their growing and multifaceted support for the\r\npeace process in Tajikistan and for their overall\r\nunflagging attention to our problems, which, regrettably,\r\nremain acute.\r\nWe commend the efforts of all States and\r\ninternational organizations that are acting as guarantors of\r\nthe General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and\r\nNational Accord in Tajikistan signed on 27 June last year\r\nin Moscow and reached with the assistance of the United\r\nNations. During the almost five years they were stationed\r\non the territory of Tajikistan, the collective peacekeeping\r\nforces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, by\r\ntheir presence and practical actions, helped stabilize the\r\nsituation in our country and helped us continue to pursue\r\nthe complex inter-Tajik political dialogue. This has led to\r\nthe implementation of the historic agreements that\r\nresulted from these talks.\r\nWe express our deep appreciation to all our friends\r\n— countries and international organizations, and in\r\nparticular United Nations agencies — that empathize with\r\nthe people of Tajikistan in their hardships and are trying\r\nto help them overcome them as soon as possible.\r\nWhile paying due tribute to the United Nations for\r\nits contribution to the strengthening of peace and national\r\nreconciliation in Tajikistan, we are fully aware that the\r\nprimary responsibility for restoring peaceful life in our\r\ncountry and for the future of our motherland lies with the\r\nleadership of the Republic of Tajikistan and with the\r\nTajik opposition.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nWe believe that the peace process in Tajikistan,\r\nthough arduous, is becoming more established and is\r\nmoving towards national accord. This is born out by the\r\nfact that the work of the Commission on National\r\nReconciliation has definitely entered a constructive phase.\r\nThe majority of refugees and displaced persons have\r\nreturned home. The process of reintegrating the United\r\nTajik Opposition armed formations into the Government\r\nmilitary structures has begun. The majority of the\r\nparticipants in the military and political resistance\r\nmovement have been granted amnesty and released from\r\nprison. All prisoners of war have been released. Virtually\r\nall the leaders of the Opposition forces have returned to the\r\ncountry and are living and working in Dushanbe.\r\nRepresentatives of the Opposition have been appointed to\r\na number of important Government posts. A process is\r\nunder way to bring the nation’s laws up to date with the\r\nnew needs of political life in Tajikistan. A number of other\r\nserious measures have also been implemented.\r\nGuided by the vital aspirations of the people and\r\nrecognizing that there is no viable alternative to full and\r\ntimely implementation of the Tajikistan General Agreement,\r\nthe country’s leadership is determined to continue to do all\r\nit can to ensure speedy implementation of all the provisions\r\nof the General Agreement.\r\nWe are grateful for the empathy for our problems\r\nshown by the former Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Tajikistan, Mr. Gerd Dietrich\r\nMerrem, who completed his work in May this year. We are\r\nprepared to build on this positive experience of cooperation\r\nin our relations with his successor, Mr. Jan Kubisz.\r\nTajikistan has great respect for the United Nations\r\nMission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) and for all its\r\nstaff. These brave and noble people are serving a lofty goal\r\nunder difficult conditions and are making a valuable\r\ncontribution to the attainment of national accord and the\r\nestablishment of peace and tranquillity in our country.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Tajikistan\r\nreaffirms its desire to continue to closely cooperate with the\r\nUnited Nations in implementing the peace accords and in\r\nthe post-conflict reconstruction of the country. We have\r\ntaken decisive action to prevent excesses similar to the\r\ntragic death this past July of four UNMOT officers, and to\r\nprovide better security for all personnel of international\r\norganizations present in Tajikistan.\r\nWhile in no way diminishing the United Nations\r\nobvious achievements in organizing collective international\r\nresponses to crisis situations in various regions of the\r\nworld, we feel obliged to draw attention once again to the\r\ndangerous, protracted Afghan conflict, which remains\r\nunresolved. We have particular reason for highlighting\r\nthis problem — above all because we feel profound\r\nsympathy for the continuing sufferings of the fraternal\r\npeople of Afghanistan. Moreover, we, together with our\r\nnearest neighbours and Russia, are very seriously\r\nconcerned about the dangers posed by the situation in\r\nAfghanistan, which threatens to destabilize the entire\r\nCentral Asian region; to lead to a massive and\r\nspontaneous exodus of Afghan refugees across the border\r\ninto Tajikistan; and to spread terrorism, arms and drugs.\r\nWe are especially alarmed about the threat of the\r\nproliferation of religious extremism, and are joining\r\nforces with Russia and Uzbekistan to counter it. Since the\r\ninter-Tajik reconciliation process has not been completed,\r\nall these factors are impacting very negatively on the\r\nsituation in our country.\r\nAs the history of Afghanistan shows, the use of\r\nforce by any internal or external actors not only is\r\nincapable of solving the problems of Afghan society, but\r\nis fraught with the danger of a new escalation of civil war\r\nin that country. In this context, we cannot but feel\r\nalarmed at developments in Afghanistan, in particular the\r\nopen disregard for the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to find a political solution to the conflict and\r\nfor the Afghan people’s desire to preserve the integrity of\r\ntheir State.\r\nWe, together with the other members of the Almaty\r\nFive, are closely following developments in the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan. Tajikistan fully supports the United\r\nNations playing a central role in coordinating all\r\ninternational efforts to find an Afghan settlement. As a\r\nmember of the group of neighbours and friends of\r\nAfghanistan, the Six plus Two group, we are firm in our\r\nopposition to any external interference in the affairs of\r\nAfghanistan, including interference in the form of sending\r\nmilitary personnel and arms to that country.\r\nThe Republic of Tajikistan notes the important role\r\nplayed by the United Nations in disarmament and in a\r\nwhole range of problems related to strengthening non-\r\nproliferation regimes with regard to weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons. In this context,\r\nwe are joining the initiative of our neighbours to create a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. We believe the\r\nestablishment of such a nuclear-free zone requires, first\r\nand foremost, action on the part of prospective parties to\r\nthat treaty. We need to consider such questions as the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\ndefinitive geographical configuration of this zone; the\r\nsubstance and range of guarantees granted to the parties by\r\nthe nuclear Powers; how to deal with any transporting of\r\nnuclear weapons through such a zone; verification\r\nmeasures; and other matters.\r\nOur position on the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in Central Asia cannot overlook the fact\r\nthat India and Pakistan have conducted nuclear tests. We\r\nfully support the urgent appeal of the Security Council to\r\nIndia and Pakistan to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We believe that\r\nboth these countries — along with the overwhelming\r\nmajority of members of the international community —\r\nmust choose the path of preventing the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nThe evolution of the world economy today is\r\ncharacterized by increasing globalization and liberalization.\r\nThis is reflected in the growing interdependence and greater\r\nopenness of national economies and of commodity and\r\nfinancial markets — a development that is beginning to\r\nhave both positive and negative impacts.\r\nWe share the view that, in addition to national efforts\r\nto increase their economic and social potential, developing\r\ncountries and those in transition need the consolidated\r\nsupport of the international community, including that of\r\nthe United Nations and other multilateral institutions.\r\nAbove all, we have in mind two things: first, the\r\ncreation of favourable international conditions so as to\r\nprovide open access to markets, as well as to financial\r\nresources and modern technology; secondly, assistance in\r\novercoming poverty, protecting the environment,\r\nimplementing economic reforms and enhancing the\r\ncompetitiveness of national enterprises. Unless we resolve\r\nthese problems, it will be impossible to fully integrate\r\ncountries in transition into the world economy.\r\nFor Tajikistan those matters are all the more relevant\r\ngiven that our country has many outstanding problems\r\ncaused by the prolonged period of military confrontation, as\r\nwell as challenges directly related to its peaceful settlement.\r\nThey include the humanitarian needs of rather large and\r\nvulnerable segments of the country’s population — needs\r\nfor food, medicine and health care. Vital infrastructure, in\r\nparticular for water supply and sanitation, needs to be\r\nrehabilitated. And, finally, assistance is needed to help\r\nrefugees and displaced persons return home, and to\r\ndemobilize and reintegrate the Tajik Opposition fighters\r\ninto civilian life.\r\nThe leadership of Tajikistan is doing all it can to\r\ndeal with the country’s humanitarian crisis caused by the\r\ninternal conflict, to rebuild the basic elements of the\r\nnational economy and to make progress in transforming\r\nit into a socially oriented market economy. However,\r\nthese efforts will be insufficient without the assistance of\r\nmany countries and international organizations, including\r\nthe humanitarian agencies of the United Nations system\r\nand the charitable funds. In this regard, we note in\r\nparticular the work of the United Nations Resident\r\nCoordinator in Tajikistan, who is responsible for\r\ncoordinating international aid to Tajikistan for its post-\r\nconflict reconstruction and further sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe hope that at this fifty-third session there will be\r\nbroad support for a resolution that fully reflects\r\nTajikistan’s needs at this difficult stage in its\r\ndevelopment, including the tasks related to\r\nimplementation of the General Agreement on the\r\nEstablishment of Peace and National Accord in our\r\ncountry.\r\nWe have gratefully acknowledged the consolidated\r\nappeal drawn up by United Nations agencies to meet the\r\nhumanitarian needs of the Tajik people for 1998. This\r\nappeal clearly defined the priorities and set the minimum\r\namount of external aid required. We would be grateful to\r\ndonors if, reflecting the spirit of support for the peace\r\nprocess in Tajikistan expressed at the Vienna meeting of\r\ndonors in October last year and at the Paris conference\r\nheld in May this year, they would meet the goals of this\r\nappeal.\r\nWe attach great importance to continuing our\r\ncooperation with institutions such as the World Bank and\r\nthe International Monetary Fund, which are seeking to\r\nprovide assistance during the post-conflict reconstruction\r\nand development of the Tajik economy. We hope that in\r\nthe near future this cooperation will further expand.\r\nTajikistan consistently supports various United\r\nNations efforts to protect the environment. As a\r\npredominantly mountainous country, Tajikistan sees\r\nparticular relevance in increasing the attention paid by the\r\ninternational community to the preservation of biological\r\ndiversity and natural mountain ecosystems. In this\r\nconnection, we actively supported the proposal of the\r\nKyrgyz Republic to declare the year 2000 the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nInternational Year of the Mountain. We were one of the co-\r\nsponsors of the relevant draft resolution, which we hope\r\nwill be adopted by consensus at this session.\r\nWe are inspired and encouraged by the growing\r\ninterest of the United Nations in helping to solve the\r\nenvironmental problems faced by our country and other\r\ncountries of Central Asia. In our view, one of the most\r\nserious ecological challenges posed not only to Tajikistan\r\nbut to almost all the countries of the region is to eliminate\r\nthe potential threat of the major natural disasters that could\r\noccur if no effective action is taken to normalize the\r\nsituation in the area of Lake Sarez, which lies 3,263 metres\r\nabove sea level and contains 17 billion tonnes of water.\r\nThis poses a grave danger not only for the people of\r\nTajikistan but also for neighbouring Uzbekistan,\r\nTurkmenistan and Afghanistan, which could sustain serious\r\ndamage in the event of a breakage of the natural dam that\r\nwas formed at the beginning of this century as a result of\r\nan earthquake. We count on our renewed cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations for help in dealing with this problem in\r\na comprehensive manner.\r\nAmong the many problems on the United Nations\r\nagenda, we would like to stress the issue of combating the\r\ndrug menace, whose deleterious impact, unfortunately, has\r\nnot bypassed our country. We fully support the coordinating\r\nrole of the United Nations in the mobilization of the\r\ninternational community’s efforts in this area. We note the\r\nusefulness and timeliness of the convening in June this year\r\nof the special session of the General Assembly devoted to\r\nthis issue.\r\nTajikistan, together with its closest neighbours, is\r\ntaking active steps to halt illicit drug trafficking. It is\r\nbroadening its cooperation with the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme. As is well known\r\nto those who have observed the situation in one of our\r\nneighbouring countries, “narcodollars” create fertile soil for\r\nterrorism and illicit drugs and arms trafficking. We view\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations as a grave\r\ncrime against humanity. The Government of the Republic\r\nof Tajikistan vigorously condemns the acts of violence that\r\nhave been committed recently in certain countries. We call\r\nupon the United Nations and its Members to declare\r\nmerciless and uncompromising war on terrorism all over\r\nthe world.\r\nTajikistan supports the steps being taken by the\r\nSecretary-General to reform the entire United Nations\r\nsystem to enable it to serve better in a new environment,\r\nand to deal with different issues without undermining the\r\nfoundation of its activities. This point must be taken into\r\naccount when dealing with expansion of the membership\r\nof the Security Council, so that this important body can\r\ncontinue effectively and expeditiously to discharge its\r\nprimary responsibility under the United Nations Charter:\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe are confident that the joint efforts of Members\r\nto reform the Organization will lead to a renewal which\r\nwill preserve its universal character and its ability to\r\nadequately meet current and future challenges.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Trade of Saint Lucia, His Excellency The\r\nHonourable George Odlum.\r\nMr. Odlum (Saint Lucia): Mr. President, it is such\r\na pleasure that a distinguished son of our region should\r\npreside over these proceedings. We wish you well and\r\npledge our full support.\r\nThis year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nbirth of a Declaration which was predicated on the\r\nassumption that the right to development is a human right.\r\nThe golden jubilee of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights could not have occurred at a more timely juncture\r\nin the history of international affairs. Article 23 of the\r\nDeclaration insists that everyone has the right to work, the\r\nfree choice of employment and protection against\r\nunemployment. Article 28 boasts that everyone is entitled\r\nto a social and international order in which the rights and\r\nfreedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully\r\nrealized.\r\nHowever, the trends that shape the international\r\norder today, the issues that are affecting the destiny of\r\nStates, are running counter to the spirit of that\r\nDeclaration, and are, in fact, threatening and hindering\r\nthat right to development so nobly expressed 50 years\r\nago.\r\nAs the world enters the dawn of a new millennium,\r\nthe phenomenon of globalization characterizes the new\r\ninternational order. There is no escaping the reality that\r\nglobalization is today a fact of life: the integration and\r\ninterlocking of systems of production, finance and capital\r\nand trade, and liberalized markets that have shunned\r\nnational boundaries and have produced remarkable wealth\r\nand economic growth.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nBut there is an almost ominous ring about the word\r\n“globalization”. It gobbles up the small plankton of\r\ncountries which cannot adjust to the frenzy of the market.\r\nGlobalization has not been all about wealth and prosperity\r\nfor all the nations of the world. For billions of people in the\r\ndeveloping world, it has used them and bypassed them,\r\nwhen in reality, globalization should be about development\r\nfor all.\r\nThe 1997 United Nations Development Programme\r\nreport confirms that only a few fortunate countries had\r\nbenefited from globalization. Those countries which have\r\nshared in the rapidly expanded world trade have seen their\r\nown trade become a larger proportion of their gross\r\ndomestic product. But for 44 developing countries, with\r\nmore than a billion people, this key ratio had been falling\r\nover the previous decade. Yes, the growth in financial\r\nflows has been rapid, but its circulation has been\r\npredominantly in the capital markets of the developed\r\nworld, while investment flows have coursed through only\r\na few developing countries.\r\nThe Asian Tiger economies, which had achieved\r\namazing levels of development and growth in a short space\r\nof time, had been held up as models for the new age of\r\nglobal free markets. However, the collapse of these\r\neconomies in 1997, coming three years after the Mexican\r\ncase, has reinforced fears that globalization has made the\r\nworld economy more volatile and more unstable. That even\r\nsuch star performers would be battered so severely suggests\r\nthat vulnerability has increased significantly with\r\nglobalization. Foreign money can flee as quickly as it\r\ncomes in and leave countries in deep trouble.\r\nSaint Lucia is one of those countries caught up on the\r\ndizzy Ferris wheel of globalization, without the luxury of\r\nthe choice of being able to jump off or determine how the\r\nwheel spins. Trade liberalization, the twin of globalization,\r\nhas not been kind to us, and the midwife of trade\r\nliberalization — the World Trade Organization (WTO) —\r\nhas dealt us an even more unkind cut.\r\nLast year, the head of our Government, Prime Minister\r\nDr. Kenny Anthony, in his address to the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-second session, complained of the\r\nimpact on Saint Lucia and the Caribbean of a ruling by the\r\nWTO with respect to the European banana marketing\r\nregime. That ruling, which was instigated by a few\r\ncomplainant countries from the Americas, has the capacity\r\nto lead to the social and economic destruction of a number\r\nof small States in the Caribbean, like Saint Lucia, for which\r\nbananas are a major vital export commodity. That ruling\r\ntears at the heart of our development process, as it can\r\ntake away from us a system which allows us a\r\npreferential market for a crop which is the backbone of\r\nour economy.\r\nDeveloping countries and many renowned jurists\r\nhave criticized the process pursued by the WTO in this\r\ncase, but what was equally worrying is that the panel did\r\nnot take into account the developmental, social and\r\nenvironmental impact of the implementation of this ruling.\r\nThe WTO is not only to be a trade policeman, but is\r\nsupposed to contribute to improving standards of living.\r\nFollowing the ruling by the WTO last year, that the\r\nbanana marketing regime was incompatible with its\r\nregulations, the European Union had been trying to amend\r\nthe regime. The objective was not only to make it WTO-\r\ncompatible, but at the same time, to preserve the kind of\r\naccess it gave us to the European market — an access\r\nessential for our economic development. Earlier this year\r\nthe European Union accepted amendments to the banana\r\nregime which we are all convinced make it WTO-\r\ncompatible. We, the banana-producing countries of the\r\nCaribbean, may have wished that some of the provisions\r\nnow adopted were different, but we are satisfied that the\r\nnew regime allows us the opportunity to continue to\r\nsurvive in the market place and sustain our development\r\nlargely through our own efforts.\r\nThe European Union retained the special safeguards\r\nof Lomé to enable us to market our bananas; and with the\r\nLomé Convention now in receipt of a WTO waiver, we\r\nthought that we had been given the breathing space we\r\nneeded for orderly reform and diversification and for\r\nadjustment to the new realities of globalization. But,\r\ndespite this, the United States and a group of Central\r\nAmerican countries are continuing an onslaught against\r\nour banana industry.\r\nOne year after our Prime Minister appealed to this\r\nbody for good sense and sensitivity to prevail in the\r\nsettling of world trade disputes, in the consideration by\r\ninternational institutions of the plight of the\r\ndisadvantaged, and in the conduct of strong and powerful\r\ncountries towards smaller and poorer ones, we return to\r\ntell the Assembly that those who should have heeded this\r\nappeal seem to have chosen not to hear it.\r\nThe pursuit of this banana policy by the United\r\nStates and the Central American countries will expose the\r\neconomies of the Caribbean to severe and possibly\r\nirreparable damage. This is a violation of our right to\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\ndevelopment — a right that the United Nations recognized\r\nas an inalienable human right when it adopted the\r\nDeclaration on the Right to Development at the 97th\r\nplenary meeting of the forty-first session of the General\r\nAssembly on 4 December 1986. One year ago, our Prime\r\nMinister, before this Assembly, called upon the United\r\nStates of America to re-examine its policies towards the\r\nCaribbean, particularly its lead role in the challenge to the\r\nbanana marketing regime. We are now engaged in a\r\ndialogue with the United States hoping to avert a\r\nreconvening of the World Trade Organization dispute panel.\r\nOnce again we urge the United States and the other\r\ncomplainant countries to apply the spirit of cooperation and\r\nconsultation to this situation so that we can find a mutually\r\nacceptable solution to what they perceive to be the\r\nproblems.\r\nGlobalization must not be used by powerful States as\r\nan excuse to condemn us to a permanent state of\r\nunderdevelopment and poverty. Already the rich nations of\r\nthe world appear to be using globalization as an excuse for\r\ntheir withdrawal from active engagement in the battle\r\nagainst poverty.\r\nThe scourge of poverty is not new, neither has it ever\r\nbeen acceptable. What is unacceptable is that given all the\r\nstrides we have made this century in science and\r\ntechnology, in the creation of vast oceans of wealth, we at\r\nthe same time have failed to reduce the levels of poverty\r\naround the world.\r\nMany people have enjoyed the benefits of supersonic\r\naircraft, 200-mile-per-hour trains, satellite telephones, global\r\ntelevision, the Internet and 24-hour markets. Yet, in the\r\nsame world and at the same time, there are millions who\r\nhave never ridden in a motor vehicle, used a telephone,\r\nswitched on an electric light or had pipe-borne water;\r\nmillions wholly unfamiliar with such everyday amenities as\r\nrefrigerators and television sets; millions who cannot read\r\nor write; millions of children who do not go to school;\r\nmillions of infants who do not get enough food to survive.\r\nA more vigorous effort to eliminate extreme\r\ndeprivation should surely be a high priority for the new\r\nmillennium. Saint Lucia believes this should be achieved by\r\nthe end of the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of\r\nPoverty — by the year 2006.\r\nEconomic progress in recent decades has lifted large\r\nnumbers out of acute poverty, and success on this front has\r\nbeen particularly notable in the populous country of China.\r\nBut there is no evidence yet that globally there has been a\r\ndecline in the number of those classified as “absolute\r\npoor”: people whose incomes never rise above the dollar-\r\na-day threshold. These are reckoned to amount to 1.3\r\nbillion people, or one in every three persons in the\r\ndeveloping world. Nearly three fourths of these people\r\nlive in Asia, but the highest proportion of very poor\r\npeople is in Africa. The 1997 report of the United\r\nNations Development Programme states that the total\r\nfigure appears to be rising with population growth, except\r\nin South-East Asia and the Pacific. But this was written\r\nbefore the economic typhoon that battered such South-\r\nEast Asian countries as Indonesia in 1998, impoverishing\r\nmany millions of people in that region, and before the\r\nserious floods in China had dispossessed so many people.\r\nYet most countries have failed to lift their aid\r\ntowards the level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national\r\nproduct — the internationally agreed target set several\r\ndecades ago. In fact, aid from the G-7 countries fell in\r\n1997 to just 0.19 per cent of their collective gross\r\nnational product.\r\nThe necessity for the rich countries to understand\r\nthat the new international order of globalization does not\r\nconsider the special circumstances of small States is\r\nemphasized by the vulnerability of these small States to\r\nother elements, such as natural disasters. The extreme\r\nvulnerability of small island States, like Saint Lucia, was\r\ngraphically illustrated only last week in the Caribbean. In\r\njust a few hours Hurricane Georges created havoc and\r\ndestruction in the northern islands of the Caribbean —\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, the Virgin\r\nIslands, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and\r\nothers. In any one island, at least two decades of\r\neconomic development were blown away by two hours of\r\nstorm. That is the extent of the economic vulnerability of\r\nthese islands. As they struggle to rebuild their economies,\r\nas their people try to reorganize their lives again, we\r\nappeal to the Member States of the United Nations to be\r\ngenerous in coming forward with assistance for their\r\nredevelopment efforts.\r\nIn a world of an international order that is\r\nuncompromising for small States, of inadequate attention\r\nto the plight of the poor and to the harsh destructive\r\nforces of Mother Nature, it is the United Nations that\r\nmust become a beacon and a haven for the small and the\r\npowerless, for the hungry and the disadvantaged. It is in\r\nthe United Nations that they must find hope and comfort,\r\nanswers and solutions to their problems. For this,\r\nhowever, there must be a United Nations that is as\r\nsensitive to the danger inherent in small-State\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nvulnerability as it is to the horrors of nuclear warfare,\r\nbiological and chemical weapons and international\r\nterrorism. International terrorism can take many forms. To\r\ndestroy a country’s economic base and thrust its people into\r\nthe slow death of unemployment, poverty and despair is as\r\nhorrendous as the instant killing of its citizens by a bomb\r\nblast.\r\nWhile we support the call for a strong abhorrence of\r\ninternational terrorism, we must deplore equally abhorrent\r\nacts of unilateral counter-terrorism. Such actions violate the\r\nculture of peace and consensus which the United Nations\r\nstrives to inculcate.\r\nThere must be a United Nations with a greater\r\ncommitment to upholding and fulfilling the tenets of article\r\n28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the\r\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Right to Development.\r\nThere must therefore be further reform of the United\r\nNations to make it more democratic and more appreciative\r\nof the voices of the majority, rather than the power of the\r\nminority. Saint Lucia therefore supports the call by the\r\nSecretary-General for continued urgent reform of the United\r\nNations, provided that it leads to a fairer, more caring and\r\nmore equitable institution.\r\nSaint Lucia also strongly supports the statement\r\ndelivered by Indonesia on behalf of the G-77 at the high-\r\nlevel dialogue on globalization held here recently and the\r\ngrowing consensus that there is urgent need for global\r\ngovernance of financial and trade matters. Indeed, because\r\nof its universal membership and success in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation for development, the United\r\nNations is the best vehicle to foster agreement on standards,\r\nnorms and regulations for the new financial order of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe building of a new international financial\r\narchitecture for the twenty-first century cannot be done\r\npiecemeal or by a few exclusive States. It requires global\r\nparticipation, coordinated by the United Nations. Saint\r\nLucia therefore calls for a global conference to address this\r\nissue similar to that held on matters pertaining to the\r\nenvironment, population and housing.\r\nBut reform must not be confined only to the United\r\nNations. In a world of trade liberalization which is not\r\nfriendly to small States, the guardian of the free market\r\nprocess must itself be reformed. Saint Lucia therefore\r\nreiterates its call, first made to the fifty-second session of\r\nthe General Assembly last year, for reform of the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) and in particular its dispute-\r\nsettlement procedures. A revisiting of the WTO began in\r\nSingapore, where developing countries had to assert the\r\nlimits of WTO interventionism.\r\nWhat is additionally required of the WTO now was\r\noutlined by Prime Minister Mr. Kenny Anthony when, in\r\nhis capacity as Chairman of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM), he addressed the recent meeting of heads of\r\nState of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban, South\r\nAfrica. He said:\r\n“More generally, the WTO must now take urgent\r\nsteps to implement the agreement at Singapore, for\r\na special regime for the least developed countries\r\nand those who share the characteristics of fragility.\r\nIt is time that values like fairness and equity asserted\r\ntheir legitimacy in the ethically neutral world of\r\nglobalization and liberalization.”\r\nSaint Lucia firmly believes that despite the actions\r\nof developed countries, we in the developing world can\r\nourselves assert and protect our right to development if\r\nwe engage in greater cooperation among ourselves. We in\r\nthe Caribbean have for years been engaged in an\r\nintegration movement which has strengthened our\r\ncapacity to deal with the challenges of international\r\nrelations. Indeed, this year Saint Lucia was proud to be\r\nthe host nation for the celebration of the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which created\r\nthe Caribbean Community.\r\nAs we embark on the next quarter of a century,\r\nSaint Lucia pledges to work for even greater union in the\r\nCaribbean Community and closer association between all\r\nthe countries of the Caribbean Sea. It is for this reason\r\nthat Saint Lucia welcomes the recent initiatives that have\r\nbrought Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti into a\r\ncloser relationship with CARICOM as we seek to forge\r\na new partnership with the European Union. In this\r\nconnection, Saint Lucia calls for the understanding that\r\nCuba is a Caribbean country and that closer relations with\r\nother Caribbean countries is a natural evolution which\r\nmust not be perceived as being hostile to the interests of\r\nextraregional Powers. We call too for the lifting of the\r\neconomic embargo against Cuba and for its reintegration\r\ninto the inter-American system. It is only through\r\ndialogue and consultation, not through conflict and\r\nhostility, that problems are permanently solved.\r\nSaint Lucia also welcomes the recent meeting in\r\nDurban between the Caribbean Community and the\r\nSouthern African Development Community, which laid\r\nthe basis for the future strengthening of relations between\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 30 September 1998\r\nthe two regions. We applaud also the decision by the heads\r\nof State of the Non-Aligned Movement to hold a South-\r\nSouth summit and their decision to convene a standing\r\nministerial committee for economic cooperation in 1999, to\r\naddress the challenges and opportunities of globalization.\r\nOur efforts to realize our right to development can\r\nenjoy fulfilment only if they take place in an atmosphere of\r\nworld peace and harmony. We cannot prevent nuclear\r\ngenies from popping out of bottles unless we destroy all the\r\nbottles with a treaty designed to eliminate all nuclear\r\narmaments. The existence of exclusive nuclear clubs is an\r\nopen invitation to nations which are excluded.\r\nWe in the Caribbean continue to call for the Caribbean\r\nto be recognized as a zone of peace. We also call for\r\nrespect and support of the initiative of CARICOM for the\r\nCaribbean Sea to be declared a special area in the context\r\nof sustainable development. Saint Lucia, therefore, like\r\nother Caribbean States, continues to register its opposition\r\nto the use of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of\r\nnuclear waste by some great Powers. While\r\nsome of those Powers can sustain a nuclear accident,\r\ngiven their size and population, a small island of a few\r\nhundred thousand people certainly cannot. The best\r\nguarantee we can obtain against a nuclear accident in the\r\nCaribbean Sea as a result of the trans-shipment of nuclear\r\nwaste is not the assurances of the countries engaged in\r\nthe practice, but a halt to the practice itself.\r\nAs we call for international recognition of our right\r\nto determine what kind of place we wish our region to be,\r\nand as we assert our inalienable human right to\r\ndevelopment and call upon others to respect that right by\r\nwithdrawing their challenge to the lifeblood of our\r\neconomy, we urge the rich nations to recognize the\r\ninsensitivity of globalization, and we ask the international\r\ncommunity to take as an example that great international\r\nleader, President Nelson Mandela. As we seek to establish\r\na new, more humane international order for the coming\r\nmillennium, an order that will truly reflect the spirit of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let us\r\nremember the moral leadership that he has given us.\r\nNelson Mandela taught us that holding steadfast to\r\nprinciple and insisting on justice can produce change even\r\nin the most intransigent of systems.\r\nThe world has become a global neighbourhood, and\r\nwe must insist on living by brotherly principles and\r\nvalues. The focus for moral leadership might have shifted\r\nto the developing world, with Nelson Mandela and Fidel\r\nCastro as the twin peaks of international inspiration. It is\r\ntheir lifelong struggle for human rights that must become\r\nthe touchstone for our developmental goals in this\r\nanniversary year.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
