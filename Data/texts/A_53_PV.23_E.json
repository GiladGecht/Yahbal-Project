(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call on\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Chad,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahamat Saleh Annadif.\r\nMr. Annadif (Chad) (interpretation from French): At\r\nthe outset, I should like, on my own personal behalf and on\r\nbehalf of the Republic of Chad, to express our great\r\npleasure and congratulations on your brilliant election, Sir,\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. The confidence placed in you to guide our work\r\nreflects the international community’s recognition of the\r\ncontribution of your country, Uruguay, to the defence of the\r\nideals of the United Nations. Your competence and\r\nexperience reinforce our conviction that you will conduct\r\nour work with success. Please be assured of the support and\r\ncooperation of the delegation of the Republic of Chad in\r\nthe accomplishment of your task.\r\nI cannot continue without first expressing all my\r\ndelegation’s gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Y.\r\nUdovenko of Ukraine, who, during his term of office,\r\nworked with such dedication, competence and tact on the\r\nmany pressing issues calling for mankind’s attention.\r\nI also pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his constant efforts to\r\nstrengthen the role of our Organization on the\r\ninternational scene, especially in the quest for\r\ninternational peace and security. In this context, may he\r\nrest assured of the renewed support of the Republic of\r\nChad for the reforms that are needed to make our\r\nOrganization better able to achieve its goals in the context\r\nof the rapid changes sweeping the world.\r\nThe ever growing problems facing humankind —\r\nincluding, inter alia, civil wars, famine, epidemics and\r\npandemics, terrorism, and the evils of globalization and\r\nmondialisation — are making our United Nations\r\nincreasingly sought after to solve them. More than ever,\r\nthe Organization needs the genuine cooperation of each of\r\nits Members in support of its efforts to ensure\r\ninternational peace and security, the sine qua non for\r\neconomic and social development. The ongoing\r\nparticipation of the Republic of Chad in the work of this\r\nAssembly; its payment of all its arrears, despite its\r\nfinancial difficulties; and the presence of elements of the\r\nChad Armed Forces in the Inter-African Mission to\r\nMonitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements\r\n(MISAB) and, later, in the United Nations Mission in the\r\nCentral African Republic (MINURCA) bear witness to\r\nour desire to cooperate with our Organization in the\r\naccomplishment of its noble mission. But this effort\r\nwould never have been possible had we not first sought\r\nto stabilize the situation in our own country, which, until\r\nrecently, was beset by a civil war fuelled by all types of\r\noutside interference.\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nIn fact, since 1 December 1990, when President Idriss\r\nDeby came to power, Chad has resolutely followed the path\r\nof national reconciliation and pluralistic democracy. The\r\nrule of law has become a tangible reality, based on the\r\nConstitution adopted by referendum on 31 March 1996,\r\nwhich was followed by presidential and legislative\r\nelections. In order to complete the process of\r\ndemocratization, the Government, together with the\r\nNational Assembly, is establishing the other institutions\r\nprovided for in the Constitution.\r\nIn this respect, I am pleased to point to the adoption\r\nby my country’s National Assembly, in early 1998, laws on\r\nthe Supreme Court and the High Court of Justice. The bill\r\non the Constitutional Council is currently being considered.\r\nAt its next session, the National Assembly will consider a\r\nbill on decentralization.\r\nIn the economic sphere, I would note that the extreme\r\npoverty in my country is not irreversible, since we have\r\nexcellent opportunities to emerge from it. This conviction\r\nhas prompted my Government to take the course of\r\neconomic and financial reform with the principal goals of\r\nrestoring the macroeconomic balance, disengaging the State\r\nfrom public enterprise and promoting the private sector.\r\nThus, since July 1995, the Government of Chad has\r\nadopted a medium-term strategy for economic recovery.\r\nThis is aimed at laying the foundations for sustainable\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nIn this framework, a structural adjustment programme\r\nhas been adopted in order to achieve high and sustained\r\neconomic growth, reduced external imbalances and\r\nstrengthened competitiveness. This programme, supported\r\nby the International Monetary Fund in the framework of a\r\ntriennial agreement under its Enhanced Structural\r\nAdjustment Facility, covering the period 1995-1998, has\r\nalso enjoyed financial assistance from the World Bank and\r\nother multilateral donors.\r\nApart from our hopes for agriculture and animal\r\nhusbandry in the fight against poverty, we rely on the\r\nimportant mineral and oil resources beneath Chadian soil.\r\nThe exploitation of our oil is one of my Government’s\r\npriorities, because with the expected oil revenue, Chad’s\r\nincome will increase substantially early in the next century,\r\nnot to mention the fact that the flow of oil investments will\r\nalso generate important added value for local enterprises.\r\nIn this respect, we have tirelessly reaffirmed that oil\r\nincome will be allocated to the fight against poverty and\r\nwill help to finance health, social and educational materials;\r\nthe modernization of agriculture and husbandry; and\r\ninfrastructure and environment. In other words, the entire\r\npopulation of Chad will benefit from this oil manna.\r\nIn this respect, we stress the fact that Chad is one of\r\nthe rare countries of the world that is managing such a\r\nsensitive endeavour as oil exploitation in all transparency.\r\nMeetings and seminars with the various sectors of civil\r\nsociety and open parliamentary debates have been\r\norganized by the Government in order to explain this\r\nendeavour in all its aspects.\r\nDespite the political and economic advances in my\r\ncountry, we deplore the campaign of lies that is being led\r\nagainst my Government. Indeed, for some time now,\r\ndisinformation and untruths have been spread among the\r\ninternational institutions and some friendly countries\r\nabout both the oil question and the human rights situation\r\nin Chad.\r\nNonetheless, my country has made considerable\r\nprogress in the area of human rights. We have ratified the\r\nmain international instruments relating to human rights\r\nand have suppressed all extraordinary judicial procedures,\r\nsuch as the court martial established in 1991. To better\r\nguarantee respect for human rights, we have established\r\na national commission for human rights, which chooses\r\nat its own discretion the questions to be considered and\r\ngoverns its own activities.\r\nAfter more than three decades of civil war, foreign\r\ninterference and ruthless dictatorships, Chad, thanks to the\r\ndetermination of its people, has succeeded in turning the\r\ndark pages of its history and in making the necessary\r\ninstitutional reforms for the establishment of a state of\r\nlaw and pluralist democracy, and it now legitimately\r\nexpects the international community’s help in fulfilling\r\nthe fundamental right of the people of Chad to economic\r\nand social development.\r\nIn this respect, I solemnly invite friendly countries\r\nand international institutions, governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental alike, interested in Chad’s development to\r\nparticipate extensively in the Geneva IV round table, to\r\nbe held from 20-22 October 1998, on strategic\r\ndevelopment options for Chad for 1998-2001.\r\nOur appeal for the development of our country\r\nwould be incomplete if we were not to raise a serious\r\nsubject of concern, the improvement of our environment,\r\nwhich has been endangered by the approximately 1\r\nmillion mines that infest a large part of our national\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nterritory and prevent all development activity. In this\r\nrespect, we reiterate the appeal for international assistance\r\nmade here by President Idriss Deby at the commemoration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization and reiterated\r\nby our delegation at the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOur concerns about domestic policy in no way divert\r\nour attention from the international situation. In Africa, we\r\nare gratified at the progress made in settling conflicts\r\nthrough negotiation. This applies particularly to Western\r\nAfrica, under the auspices of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS), particularly in Liberia,\r\nSierra Leone and, more recently, in Guinea-Bissau.\r\nThe efforts undertaken in the Central African Republic\r\nfirst by MISAB and then by MINURCA have yielded\r\nsatisfactory results. My country is proud to have been a\r\nparticipant in these efforts since 1996. We are duty-bound\r\nto work towards consolidating peace, which remains fragile\r\nin that fraternal neighbouring country. The legislative\r\nelections will be an important stage in the peace process,\r\nand the elections therefore call for the full support of the\r\ninternational community. A premature withdrawal of\r\nMINURCA, before these elections which are but one stage\r\nof the process, would endanger the costly efforts made for\r\npeace. In these troubling times throughout Central Africa,\r\nwe appeal for much more patience in order to enable the\r\ninternational community to assist the Central African people\r\neven farther along the path of national reconciliation and\r\nsecurity, as the United Nations does everywhere.\r\nThe strengthening of existing structures for the\r\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts in\r\nAfrica must be encouraged and firmly supported by the\r\ninternational community, regardless of whether it is a\r\nmatter for the Standing Advisory Committee on Security\r\nQuestions in Central Africa or the United Nations Regional\r\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, located at\r\nLomé, Togo.\r\nDespite the existence of these mechanisms, hotbeds of\r\ntension have emerged here and there in Africa, dangerously\r\nthreatening peace and security on that continent, which\r\nmore than ever needs peace and security for its economic\r\nrecovery. Thus, we deplore the persistent situation of war\r\nin the countries of the Great Lakes region, and particularly\r\nthe ravages of war in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. It is urgently necessary that genuine efforts be made\r\nby the international community under the aegis of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), with the cooperation\r\nof the States of the region, so that the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo can exercise its right to national\r\nreconciliation, the unity of its sons and daughters, its\r\nterritorial integrity and national sovereignty. This means\r\nthe withdrawal of the forces of aggression that occupy the\r\nentire eastern part of that brotherly country.\r\nWith respect to Angola, Chad believes that\r\nMr. Jonas Savimbi is the only party responsible for the\r\ndeterioration of the situation. We therefore make a\r\nheartfelt appeal to the international community and the\r\nSecurity Council to acknowledge the new direction taken\r\nby UNITA and to provide it the assistance necessary to\r\npromptly achieve the terms of the Lusaka Protocol.\r\nIn the Horn of Africa, the armed conflict between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea threatens peace in that part of the\r\ncontinent. The relative calm obtained, thanks to OAU\r\nmediation, must be observed in order to facilitate\r\nnegotiations with a view to a peaceful settlement of the\r\ndispute between those two fraternal countries.\r\nClose to those two countries, the situation of latent\r\nwar in Somalia is far from reassuring. In that country,\r\nwhere the different factions in conflict are sowing terror,\r\nwar could break out at any time. It is important to make\r\na concerted effort to reintegrate that country into the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe consequences of these hotbeds of tension\r\nafflicting the African continent can be measured in the\r\nnumber of homeless people and refugees moving from\r\none country to another in search of a land that will\r\nwelcome them, not to mention the very high number of\r\ninnocent victims, including maimed and starving\r\nindividuals.\r\nHaving recently suffered the horrors of war\r\nourselves, our country is keenly aware of the value of\r\npeace and appeals to the collective conscience to bring an\r\nend to the multiple tragedies affecting innocent African\r\npopulations.\r\nThe same challenges confront us in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, where the implementation of the Dayton\r\nAgreement must be firmly supported so that a lasting\r\npeace can be established in that part of the world.\r\nIn Afghanistan, Chad urges the Taliban in power in\r\nKabul and the opposition coalition to undertake a frank\r\nand sincere dialogue in order to achieve a lasting peace.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nIn the Middle East, the hope of peace raised by the\r\nOslo accords is fading daily because of the stalled Israeli-\r\nPalestinian talks. We urge all the parties concerned to\r\nrespect their commitments, as this is the only way to\r\nachieve a lasting peace in that part of the world. Neither\r\nviolence nor extremism, much less intransigence, will\r\nenable the achievement of a just and definitive solution to\r\nthis crisis which has lasted too long.\r\nMy country, Chad, noted with satisfaction the end of\r\nthe bipolar world and the radical change that took place in\r\nthe international situation. By resuming diplomatic relations\r\nwith the Republic of China on Taiwan, the Government and\r\nthe people of Chad had only one consideration: to diversify\r\nrelations of friendship with cooperation with all the peace-\r\nand justice-loving countries of the world on the basis of\r\nequality and solidarity. Thus Chad gave its support to the\r\nrequest that an examination of General Assembly resolution\r\n2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971 be inscribed on the\r\nagenda of the fifty-third session, because of the radical\r\nchanges in the international situation and the coexistence of\r\ntwo Governments, one on each side of the Straits of\r\nTaiwan.\r\nWe are gratified at the progress, however slow, that\r\nhas been achieved in recent years in the fields of\r\ndisarmament and the fight against narcotic drugs. However,\r\nwe denounce the scandalous trade in conventional weapons\r\nwhich fuel so many conflicts and bring bloodshed to so\r\nmany parts of the world. We are prepared to support all\r\nmeasures aimed at combating this scourge.\r\nFurthermore, and in the face of the globalization and\r\nuniversalization that is engendering the arrogant\r\ntriumphalism of the powerful, the international community\r\nmust rise above the disparities among its members and find\r\nadequate ways of overcoming the negative impact on a\r\nfragile international balance of the mutations that are\r\ncurrently taking place. In so doing, it must give priority to\r\nconsensus and agreement among its members and reject\r\nunilateral actions conducted in its name but in disdain for\r\nthe principles and rules that govern it. Therefore, it is\r\nurgent that peace- and justice-loving nations speak out to\r\ndenounce the frequent interferences in the internal affairs of\r\nStates and take a unanimous stand against the economic\r\nsanctions that are often ineffective and are unjust and\r\nfraught with social consequences, as well.\r\nFor this reason, Chad once again firmly condemns the\r\nhaste with which unilateral air strikes were made against a\r\nsimple pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan, causing the\r\nloss of innocent lives in that fraternal neighbouring country.\r\nIn this respect, Chad reiterates its support to the appeal\r\nmade from this rostrum by the current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to send a fact-\r\nfinding mission to study the matter.\r\nAs for the Lockerbie affair, while we support the\r\nresolution of the latest OAU summit, in Ouagadougou, on\r\nthis question, Chad is also gratified that the United States\r\nand Great Britain have agreed that the trial of the two\r\nsuspects take place in a neutral country. We appeal to\r\nthose two countries and to the Netherlands to undertake\r\nnegotiations with Libya, either directly or through the\r\nmediation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nin order to conclude an arrangement for the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1192\r\n(1998) and thus to establish the modalities for the trial,\r\nincluding measures of security and guarantees for the\r\nsuspects. These negotiations are indispensable if this\r\nquestion is to be truly resolved.\r\nThat being said, may there be no mistake as to the\r\nmeaning of our policy. We wholeheartedly condemn\r\nterrorism in all its forms. The many victims of the recent\r\nterrorist actions against the United States Embassies at\r\nNairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, as well as the equally tragic\r\nreactions that have ensued, force us to reaffirm strongly\r\nthat no end can justify such recourse to an aggressive and\r\nblind fundamentalism.\r\nIt is clear that the infinite despair in which millions\r\nof human beings are submerged cannot be alleviated by\r\nthe use of force, wherever it may originate. Furthermore,\r\nthe radical fundamentalism often inveighed against today\r\nis not the preserve of any specific faith. To attribute it\r\nlightly to one religion or one people inevitably reduces\r\nthe scope of the actions undertaken to circumscribe it.\r\nWe therefore support the plan for the urgent\r\nconvening of an international conference under United\r\nNations auspices in order to establish the modalities of an\r\neffective international cooperation for the total eradication\r\nof terrorism in all its forms.\r\nOn another matter which is related to the preceding\r\nconcerns, we would like to express our deep concern at\r\nthe present state of international economic relations. It is\r\nindeed deplorable to see that the process of detente that\r\nis evident in the international political situation and in the\r\nglobalization of the economy has in no way modified the\r\nunequal economic relations, so that the imbalances\r\nbetween rich and poor States are increasingly glaring. If\r\ngrowth has continued in the developed countries for\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nalmost fifty years now, the opposite has taken place in the\r\ndeveloping countries, where growth has stagnated, if not\r\nregressed. Thus, the eternal problems of indebtedness and\r\ndeterioration in the terms of trade have been compounded\r\nby the problem of the constant marginalization of the\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular those of our African\r\ncontinent, on international economic circuits.\r\nIn order to achieve the objective of lasting growth and\r\ndevelopment in the interests of humankind, we invite the\r\ninternational community to work for a system based on\r\nrules that are just, fair and more open; for the progressive\r\nliberation and elimination of obstacles to trade, in both\r\ngoods and services; for the rejection of all forms of\r\nprotectionism; etc. It is therefore urgent that concrete\r\nmeasures be adopted to make it possible for Africa to\r\nachieve sustained growth which should lead to real\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to reiterate our complete\r\nsupport for the United Nations both in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and in the establishment of\r\na just and equitable international order.\r\nBut if the United Nations wishes fully to play the role\r\nit has been given, it must adapt to the realities of the day.\r\nIt must be credible and its legitimacy must be undeniable.\r\nThe Security Council in its current form is far from\r\nenshrining these ideals, for two principal reasons: first, its\r\ncomposition does not at all reflect the views of the whole\r\nand especially of the least and the smallest; secondly, it\r\npursues a policy based on a double standard, which makes\r\nits decisions increasingly vulnerable.\r\nGiven this situation, the need for Security Council\r\nreform is self-evident. Such reform must respond to the\r\nexpectations of Member States. This means that there must\r\nbe a recomposition of the Council as well as a review of its\r\ndecision-making procedures, in particular the right of veto,\r\nwhich is used and abused. We must reaffirm the position\r\ntaken by the last Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity: the\r\nAfrican continent must be equitably represented in that\r\norgan where the fate of all humanity is at stake. It is\r\ninconceivable and impossible to accept that an important\r\nsector of humanity continues to endure the harshness of\r\ndecisions in which it did not participate.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Abdel-Elah Khatib, the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\r\nMr. Khatib (Jordan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me, at the outset, to congratulate you and the\r\nGovernment and people of Uruguay on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. I would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress my deep appreciation and gratitude to your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for\r\nhis successful and distinguished management of the last\r\nsession.\r\nI would be remiss if I failed to pay tribute as well to\r\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor his efforts to promote the authority of this\r\nOrganization and achieve its noble aims and objectives\r\nand those of its Charter. I note in particular his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization, and I emphasize that he\r\nmay count on the full support and cooperation of my\r\ndelegation in his efforts to establish peace and security in\r\nthe world.\r\nJordan has always believed in the noble aims and\r\nobjectives of the Charter of the United Nations. We have\r\nmade every possible effort to maintain international peace\r\nand security, particularly in the Middle East, a volatile\r\nregion whose peoples have, for over half a century,\r\nsuffered from the scourge of war and from conflicts and\r\ndisturbances and who have lived under difficult\r\ncircumstances characterized by confrontation and\r\npolarization. Jordan, under the leadership of His Majesty\r\nKing Hussein Ibn Talal, has always been an oasis of\r\nsecurity and stability. It has always raised the voice of\r\nreason and moderation and as a result has had to shoulder\r\nheavy burdens that have exhausted its natural, financial\r\nand economic resources and placed an additional strain on\r\nits development process.\r\nThroughout the past decades, Jordan has made\r\ncontinuous efforts to achieve a peaceful and honourable\r\nsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It continues to\r\nstrive towards that goal by upholding the peace treaty\r\nwhich it reached with Israel within the framework of the\r\nMadrid Conference, and it continues to support efforts to\r\nreach an agreement on the Palestinian, Israeli and other\r\ntracks.\r\nHowever, the peace process remains deadlocked,\r\ndespite the efforts to move it forward, including the\r\ninitiative being made by the United States on the\r\nPalestinian track. As we recognize the centrality of the\r\nPalestinian track as regards the peace process, we value\r\nthe positive stand taken by the Palestinian leadership and\r\nits sincere desire to reach an agreement that would end\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nthe deadlock on this track and result in the full and clear\r\nacceptance of this initiative.\r\nWe therefore demand that the Israeli Government\r\ndeclare its full acceptance of the United States initiative,\r\ncarry out its commitment under the agreements and remove\r\nall obstacles to reaching an agreement on redeployment and\r\nother outstanding issues. This would make it possible to\r\nachieve real progress on this track with a view to ending\r\nthe deadlock, resuming and attaining the objectives of the\r\npeace process and ensuring the legitimate national rights of\r\nthe Palestinian people, including the right to establish their\r\nindependent State on their national territory.\r\nCiting security considerations as pretexts for\r\nobstructing actual progress will further undermine the\r\nsecurity of every party in the region. Security cannot be\r\nenhanced except through a just and honourable peace, one\r\nwhich is convincing to the peoples of the region and one\r\nwhich they can defend.\r\nThe occupied city of Jerusalem has been the most\r\nimportant component of the Arab-Israeli conflict throughout\r\nits various stages. It is part of the Arab territories occupied\r\nin 1967. Therefore, any consideration that apply to those\r\nterritories also apply to Jerusalem, in particular Security\r\nCouncil resolution 242 (1967).\r\nWe call upon Israel to cease and void all actions that\r\nwould change the status of the Holy City. Under the Oslo\r\naccords concluded between Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization, it was agreed that the final status\r\nof the city was to be decided in final status negotiations.\r\nAny unilateral actions taken before the conclusion of those\r\nnegotiations would constitute a violation of the Oslo\r\naccords and of all resolutions of international legitimacy.\r\nUntil the status of the city is finally decided, it should\r\nremain open to all adherents of the three divine,\r\nmonotheistic religions. Jordan has for many years assumed\r\nresponsibility for maintaining the sanctity of the city of\r\nJerusalem and has also taken it upon itself, under the\r\ncircumstances of the occupation, to take care of and\r\npreserve the Holy Places.\r\nOn the other hand, Israel should desist from all\r\nunilateral actions against the Palestinian people, such as\r\nclosures, sieges, arrests, the demolition of homes, the\r\nconfiscation of land and the building of settlements in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem. Israel\r\nmust lift the restrictions that hinder the development of the\r\nPalestinian economy and enable the Palestinian people to\r\nstart establishing normal economic relations with the\r\noutside world, free from domination and from economic\r\ncontrol. It must also deal with the Palestinian people as\r\nits partners in the peace process, partners who are looking\r\nforward to living side by side with Israel on the basis of\r\ngood neighbourliness and equality, not as a people under\r\noccupation.\r\nWith regard to negotiations on the other tracks,\r\nIsrael must prove its seriousness about resuming\r\nnegotiations with Syria and Lebanon from the point at\r\nwhich they ended, ensuring its withdrawal from the\r\nSyrian Arab Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967,\r\nimplementing Security Council resolution 425 (1978) by\r\nunconditionally withdrawing from southern Lebanon and\r\nreaching peace agreements with both of them, on the road\r\ntowards achieving a comprehensive peace in the region.\r\nFive decades have passed since the tragedy of the\r\nPalestinian refugees began. The United Nations Relief and\r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\r\n(UNRWA) continues to carry out its duties towards the\r\nPalestinian refugees — a recognition by the international\r\ncommunity of its responsibility with regard to this\r\ntragedy. However, in recent years UNRWA has been\r\nsuffering from severe financial crises, which sometimes\r\nthreaten to suspend or put an end to its services and the\r\ncompletion of its work. We would therefore like to\r\nemphasize once again that Jordan attaches the utmost\r\nimportance to the continuation of UNRWA’s work,\r\nespecially given the fact that Jordan hosts the largest\r\nnumber of Palestinian refugees and provides services to\r\nthem above and beyond the budget of UNRWA.\r\nJordan has consistently called for UNRWA to\r\ncontinue its work until the refugee problem is completely\r\nresolved through the return of refugees to their land and\r\nhomes and/or their compensation in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III). The expiry of the\r\nfive-year transitional period under the Oslo accords does\r\nnot mean that UNRWA’s mission is over or that there is\r\nno longer any need for it to exist. The basic condition for\r\nthe end of UNRWA’s mission is an agreement on a final\r\nsolution to the refugee problem and on the full and\r\ncomplete implementation of that agreement.\r\nWe understand the continued existence of UNRWA\r\nand its work from three perspectives: the human, the\r\npolitical and the legal. To ignore any of them would\r\nprejudice international responsibility for the tragedy of the\r\nrefugees, who have been displaced from their homes. We\r\ntherefore appeal to the donor countries to continue to\r\nmake contributions to UNRWA, increasing them as much\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nas possible in proportion to the natural increase in the\r\nnumbers of refugees and the need to satisfy their basic\r\nhumanitarian needs. We also appeal to all financially able\r\nStates to provide the necessary financial support to\r\nUNRWA.\r\nWe draw your attention to the fact that were UNRWA\r\nto stop providing services to refugees, this would in itself\r\nconstitute an additional obstacle to the peace process, in\r\naddition to destabilizing the region through the frustration\r\ncaused by increased poverty among the refugees and the\r\ndeterioration of their economic situation.\r\nIt is indeed sad that while the world celebrates the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights we still talk about the\r\ndeteriorating situation of the Palestinian refugees and their\r\nhuman basic rights. On this occasion, we are called upon to\r\nwork for increased commitments to respect and to find an\r\neffective international mechanism to implement\r\ninternational instruments relative to human rights, away\r\nfrom selectivity and double standards. We are also called\r\nupon to establish a balance between these international\r\ninstruments, on the one hand, and the national systems and\r\nlaws in force in various countries of the world, without\r\nprejudice to the principle of State sovereignty, on the other.\r\nWe therefore feel that we should recall the appeal made\r\nfrom this rostrum by His Royal Highness Crown Prince El-\r\nHassan for the establishment of a new international\r\nhumanitarian order. In this spirit, my country participated\r\nand supported the adoption of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court in Rome earlier this year.\r\nCooperation and coexistence among different religious\r\nand ethnic groups requires a formula for dialogue among\r\ncivilizations and religions to replace the concepts of conflict\r\nand fear of foreigners which has emerged recently.\r\nDialogue among religions will highlight the common\r\ndenominators among the different beliefs of the world’s\r\npeoples and would explain their foundations to the other\r\nparties, thereby making it easier to understand and to\r\ncoexist with one another.\r\nThe desired inter-religious dialogue is the best way to\r\nconfront the incipient manifestations of animosity and the\r\nattempts to distort the image of Islam and Muslims,\r\nwhether those living in their home countries or those who\r\nhave emigrated to non-Muslim countries. It is necessary to\r\nhave a deeper understanding of Islam and the Muslims,\r\naway from the blind bigotry which leads to unfair\r\ngeneralizations about, and the stereotyping of, over one\r\nbillion Muslims. From that narrow view, bigotry leads to\r\nanimosity towards Islam and the Muslims on the basis of\r\nactions committed by a minority which is farthest\r\nremoved from Muslims and the tolerant concepts of\r\nIslam.\r\nThe question of human rights leads us to mention\r\nthe continued suffering of the Iraqi people over the past\r\neight years as a result of economic sanctions. While we\r\ncall upon the Government of Iraq to fully and\r\nmeticulously comply with all Security Council resolutions,\r\nto cooperate fully and constructively with the United\r\nNations towards that end and to commit itself to\r\nrepatriating Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons,\r\nwe call upon the international community to relieve the\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people. We also emphasize the\r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of both\r\nIraq and Kuwait.\r\nOther peoples in the region, like the Libyan and\r\nSudanese peoples, have suffered and continue to suffer\r\nfrom sanctions. Others who were not targeted by\r\nsanctions have also suffered from the impact of these\r\nsanctions. My country, Jordan, was the first to suffer\r\ntremendous damage to its economy as a result of the\r\nsanctions imposed on Iraq. Nevertheless, we have not\r\nonly patiently persevered; we have made our best efforts\r\nto abide by Security Council resolutions out of respect for\r\ninternational legitimacy.\r\nWeapons of mass destruction constitute a dangerous\r\nsource of tension and instability. The Middle East region\r\nhas been afflicted with the existence of these weapons.\r\nPerhaps the ideal solution to dispose of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and to end the tension and instability caused\r\nby their presence is by concluding international treaties\r\nestablishing zones free from nuclear weapons and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction in various regions of the\r\nworld, including the Middle East.\r\nWe view with utmost concern nuclear tests carried\r\nout recently in South-East Asia in the context of an arms\r\nrace which, if continued, would have extremely dangerous\r\nconsequences. A majority of the world’s countries have\r\nfor a long time committed themselves to international\r\nguarantees that would prevent the proliferation and use of\r\nnuclear weapons. It is very unfortunate that some would\r\ndepart from this moral commitment which had previously\r\nprevented them from falling into the trap of a vain\r\nnuclear arms race in that region. In this regard, we call\r\nupon all countries that have not yet done so to accede to\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in\r\norder to safeguard international peace and security and\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\ncontribute to the attainment of the goal of general and\r\ncomplete disarmament. This would enable humanity to rid\r\nitself of the terror of nuclear weapons and other weapons\r\nof mass destruction.\r\nWe view with particular sensitivity the threat posed by\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Israel possesses and is\r\ndeveloping a nuclear-weapons arsenal. The possibility of a\r\nconfrontation between it and other States that have such\r\nweapons or other weapons of mass destruction, such as\r\nchemical and biological weapons, makes us live under the\r\nthreat of these weapons and the dangers of their use at any\r\nmoment. Therefore we demand that a regional security\r\nmechanism be established and that a forum be established\r\nto discuss this matter in a way that would ensure the\r\nremoval of this threat. In this context, there is a need to\r\nestablish conflict-resolution and conflict-prediction centres\r\nin the region to anticipate such disputes before they occur\r\nand to prevent them from happening and escalating.\r\nThe comprehensive concept of security — a concept\r\nthat is in conformity with the new developments and\r\nconcepts that have matured recently, particularly after the\r\nend of the cold war and the disappearance of the policy of\r\npolarization — has become a wide concept that carries\r\nwithin it all concerns and problems — economic, social,\r\npolitical and humanitarian. These problems may lead to the\r\nmarginalization and frustration of large sectors of society\r\nthat would in turn sow the seeds of instability and\r\ndisturbances which lead to the escalation of existing\r\ndisputes and the creation of new ones. It would also lead to\r\nthe growth and spread of terror to a disturbing extent.\r\nJordan has for so long called for the rooting out of the\r\nscourge of terrorism by eliminating its causes and by\r\nestablishing justice and political solutions, accepted and\r\npreserved by peoples. We have also called for confronting\r\nterrorism with all the firmness needed and for the concerted\r\nand systematic international action required under the\r\numbrella of the United Nations, guided by its Charter, to\r\nfind appropriate and effective mechanisms to combat\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe therefore condemn the two terrorist attacks in\r\nNairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. We also condemn most\r\nstrongly terrorist acts of all kinds and forms wherever they\r\noriginate. In this context, it is worth noting the ceaseless\r\nefforts made by the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\r\nas emphasized at its Twelfth Summit Conference, held at\r\nTehran in December 1997, to establish a code of conduct\r\nthat would unify State views on terrorism and action by\r\nthese States to combat and eradicate it.\r\nThe General Assembly is meeting while the world\r\nwitnesses conflicts and struggles in various regions like\r\nthe Balkans, Asia and Africa. In Kosovo, massacres are\r\nstill being committed against innocent civilians despite the\r\nrecent Security Council resolution on that question. In\r\nAfghanistan, the Congo and other places, fighting\r\ncontinues despite international efforts to stop the\r\nbloodshed and find solutions within the framework of the\r\nCharter and the principles of international law.\r\nPeacekeeping operations are among the most\r\nimportant activities undertaken by our Organization for\r\nthe promotion of world peace, security and stability.\r\nJordan has always believed in the noble goals of these\r\nactivities and for several years has participated in them.\r\nThe world has made important steps towards the\r\ndisposal of anti-personnel landmines, which every year\r\nkill thousands of innocent people and leave thousands\r\nmore with permanent disabilities, preventing them from\r\nexercising their natural right to life. In recognition of the\r\nimportance of the Convention banning anti-personnel\r\nmines, Jordan has decided to accede to it. Her Majesty\r\nQueen Noor has sponsored the international effort to rid\r\nhumanity of this dangerous threat, thereby embodying\r\nJordan’s belief in the humanitarian dimensions and the\r\nnoble goals of the Convention.\r\nDuring the past few years we have witnessed\r\ndevelopments that have left a deep impact on the world\r\neconomy, including the transition to a market economy,\r\nthe removal of economic barriers and the trend towards\r\na globalized economy. Such developments place burdens\r\non developing countries and their economies. This\r\nrequires finding the necessary means to avoid the negative\r\nimpact of these developments on these countries and to\r\nhelp them adapt their economies to the changes and\r\nprepare them to join the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO).\r\nAmong these modalities is a commitment by wealthy\r\ncountries to increase official development assistance, to\r\nfind comprehensive solutions to the problem of external\r\ndebt, to integrate developing countries into the world free-\r\ntrade system, and to improve terms of trade.\r\nAs a developing country, Jordan has suffered from\r\neconomic problems, which grew worse following the Gulf\r\nwar of the early 1990s. With the help of the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF), Jordan has pursued structural\r\nadjustment policies that have resulted in tangible progress.\r\nJordan has succeeded in reducing its budget deficit and\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nthe size of its external debt. It has improved its\r\nmacroeconomic indicators, reformed financial regulations in\r\nits banking sector and energized the role of the private\r\nsector. Yet we still face a difficult economic situation\r\nowing to regional conditions and to the impact on our\r\neconomy of the crisis in countries of South-East Asia, with\r\nmany of which we maintain close economic ties. Our\r\nexports to those countries have been adversely affected by\r\nthe crisis.\r\nImproving the economic situation in our region\r\nrequires the removal of barriers and restrictions that\r\nobstruct the flow of goods and services among the countries\r\nof the region, and cooperation among those countries in\r\nconfronting the economic and environmental challenges\r\nbefore us. We are all aware that the problems and\r\nchallenges we are confronting are increasing in scope and\r\nin complexity; most of them defy individual or immediate\r\nsolution. We need increased cooperation to deal with them\r\non the basis of the interdependence and interrelationship of\r\nevents throughout the world.\r\nWe live in one world, a world in which distances are\r\nshrinking and barriers disappearing. For international\r\ncooperation in the interest of humanity to be sustainable,\r\nwe must all avoid confrontation and abide by international\r\nlaw. No State should be above the law. We must therefore\r\nfoster democracy in the international system; that system\r\nshould be free of hegemony and inequality. The United\r\nNations should be viewed as the framework of that\r\ncooperation; this would build smaller States’ confidence in\r\njustice.\r\nAs we stand on the threshold of the third millennium,\r\nwe hope that dialogue among peoples and civilizations will\r\nbe strengthened. We hope that attitudes and actions will be\r\ndefined by the fact that what we do today will affect future\r\ngenerations. Our concern for future generations obliges us\r\nto create conditions that are better than those of the past.\r\nWe can do this only with mutual understanding and\r\ncoexistence, and only with the political will to create a\r\nbetter world. We are confident that future generations\r\ndeserve that from us, and we are confident that we can\r\nprovide it.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\nnext on His Excellency The Honourable Thomas Motsoahae\r\nThabane, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lesotho.\r\nMr. Thabane (Lesotho): I should like, Mr. President,\r\nto extend to you our very warm congratulations on your\r\nelection to lead the business of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-third session. Your election bears testimony to the\r\nvery high esteem in which we hold you and your country.\r\nYou can count on our unstinting support and cooperation\r\nduring the year that lies ahead. Through you, Sir, permit\r\nme also to salute your very worthy predecessor, Mr.\r\nHennadiy Udovenko, the former Foreign Minister of\r\nUkraine, for the illustrious manner in which he led the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session.\r\nIn your address at the opening of this session,\r\nMr. President, you challenged us to focus our attention on\r\nthe major issues of our time. The list of issues that you\r\nprovided was comprehensive, but I wish here to highlight\r\nonly some of them — without passing judgment on their\r\nrelative worth.\r\nThe Secretary-General has submitted a report on\r\ncauses of conflict in Africa at the request, last year, of the\r\nSecurity Council. It is an excellent report, for which the\r\nSecretary-General should be commended. The recent\r\nevents in Lesotho, to a large measure, fit in with the\r\nSecretary-General’s diagnosis. Nothing could be closer to\r\nthe truth than the Secretary-General’s observation that\r\n“Where there is insufficient accountability of\r\nleaders, lack of transparency in regimes, inadequate\r\nchecks and balances, non-adherence to the rule of\r\nlaw, absence of peaceful means to change or replace\r\nleadership, or lack of respect for human rights,\r\npolitical control becomes excessively important, and\r\nthe stakes become dangerously high”. (A/52/871,\r\npara. 12)\r\nOur recent experience in Lesotho is that instability is\r\nlikely to arise even when Governments are deeply\r\nconscious of the need to abide by those prescriptions, if\r\nother political players are not similarly committed to\r\nthem.\r\nOn 23 May 1998, a general election was held in\r\nLesotho under the management of an Independent\r\nElectoral Commission established with the full\r\ncooperation of all political parties. The Commission, a\r\nnew institution in the history of Lesotho, was without\r\nprevious experience. The elections were observed by 400\r\nlocal and 150 international observers, including observers\r\nfrom the United Nations, all of whom declared them free\r\nand fair. Soon afterwards, however, three of the 12\r\nopposition parties alleged that the Lesotho Congress for\r\nDemocracy had won through fraud. Vice-President Thabo\r\nMbeki of South Africa attempted to mediate in this\r\ndispute, and all the parties agreed to an audit of the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nelection results, conducted by the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), in order to determine\r\nthe existence or otherwise of fraud. The Commission of\r\nInvestigation, which came to be known as the Langa\r\nCommission after its Chairman, Justice Pius Langa of South\r\nAfrica, found that, while there had been administrative\r\nirregularities, there had been no fraud and the elections\r\ncould not be said not to represent the will of the electorate.\r\nBut even in the absence of fraud, the opposition\r\nparties still insisted on the resignation of the Government,\r\nthe dissolution of Parliament and the establishment by the\r\nKing of a government of national unity in which all the\r\nmajor parties would be equally represented. In an attempt\r\nto achieve this, the opposition parties perpetrated\r\nlawlessness, which resulted in an army mutiny, the forced\r\nand illegal dismissal of the command structure by junior\r\nofficers, and open support by those junior officers for the\r\nopposition-led civil unrest in preparation for an illegal\r\ntakeover of the Government.\r\nIt was in this state of virtual coup d’état that the\r\nLesotho Prime Minister appealed to the Presidents of\r\nBotswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for\r\nmilitary assistance to restore law and order and to enforce\r\ndiscipline in the Lesotho army. The responsibility was\r\nshouldered by the SADC member States Botswana and\r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the entire SADC. While these\r\nSADC troops were busy neutralizing the army mutiny and\r\nthe virtual coup, the supporters of opposition parties\r\nembarked on a campaign of arson and looting in the central\r\nbusiness district of the capital, Maseru, which later spread\r\nto other towns of the country.\r\nAlthough the full extent of the damage to business\r\ninfrastructure is not yet known with certainty, preliminary\r\nestimates put it at above $200 million. For a small least\r\ndeveloped country like Lesotho, such an amount is a heavy\r\nburden on an already fragile economy. The Government of\r\nLesotho therefore appeals to the international community\r\nfor assistance in rebuilding the infrastructure that has been\r\nso wantonly destroyed.\r\nWe have already made contacts with the World Bank\r\nfor a more precise assessment of our needs in this regard,\r\nand once these are known we shall be making a more\r\nfocused appeal. Above and beyond the assistance with\r\nphysical reconstruction, it is quite clear that the type of\r\nassistance which the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and some bilateral donors were giving\r\nto reorient the minds of our army has not yet had a lasting\r\nimpact. Lesotho has had a sad history of an army that was\r\ndeliberately filled with supporters of one political party\r\nwhen that party was in power for over 20 years. As a\r\nconsequence, our army has had great difficulty in\r\nsubmitting to the authority of a new master. Recent\r\nevents have underscored the urgent need to overhaul the\r\nLesotho army, as was done under international\r\nsupervision in Haiti.\r\nFurthermore, all political parties need to submit\r\nthemselves to the discipline and responsibilities that are\r\ndemanded of them as actors in the democratic system.\r\nThis includes the acceptance of defeat in general\r\nelections. Otherwise, those politicians who deliberately\r\nundermine the democratic culture should be exposed and\r\nofficially branded by the international community as\r\ncriminals, as the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) has done with Savimbi in Angola.\r\nSince 1993, Lesotho has been embarked on a\r\nprogramme of entrenching democracy, the rule of law and\r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The\r\ncurrent crisis has amply demonstrated how difficult it is\r\nto make people whose only preoccupation is the\r\nachievement of personal political power participate in this\r\nprocess.\r\nThe Government of Lesotho is grateful for the\r\nsupport of the countries of SADC in once again reversing\r\na coup in Lesotho. SADC has given practical expression\r\nto what has become an all-Africa commitment to the\r\nabhorrence of military overthrow of legitimate\r\nGovernments, such as occurred recently in Sierra Leone\r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe extent of recent lawlessness in Lesotho has\r\nunderscored the need to control the illicit possession of\r\nsmall arms and light weapons. In Lesotho recently, young\r\npeople, many of them in their teens, were able to\r\nintimidate law-abiding citizens with guns and to force\r\nthem to surrender Government property and to evacuate\r\nGovernment offices and private industrial enterprises.\r\nSmall arms and light weapons have become so\r\ncommonplace that they have encouraged habitual recourse\r\nto violence, thus threatening the cohesion and well-being\r\nof many societies. These low-tech, inexpensive and easy\r\nto use weapons — numbering hundreds of millions —\r\ncause as much as 90 per cent of the deaths in\r\ncontemporary conflicts. Their proliferation contributes to\r\nviolence, loss of life and property, social instability, the\r\ndisruption of economic development and the threat to\r\ndemocratic governance.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nDuring the cold war, arms control and disarmament\r\nefforts focused exclusively on major weapons systems, such\r\nas tanks, jet fighters and nuclear weapons. Although this\r\nhas begun to change in recent years, there are still no\r\ninternational standards regarding small arms. Their\r\nproduction, trade and possession remain essentially\r\nunmonitored and unregulated. Lesotho therefore strongly\r\nsupports current efforts to find an international solution to\r\nthese problems posed by the unregulated proliferation of\r\nillicit small arms and light weapons.\r\nThe Government of Lesotho is understandably\r\ndisappointed that its efforts to build and consolidate a\r\nculture of democratic governance seem to have suffered a\r\nsetback, especially this year, when we are celebrating the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. However, Lesotho will not be deflected from the\r\npath it has chosen of moving forward to truly democratic\r\ngovernance in which all citizens enjoy their right to\r\npolitical freedom and personal happiness.\r\nFifty years ago, the peoples of the world set down\r\nstandards for their security, happiness and well-being in the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. In the intervening\r\nperiod, the international community and the United Nations\r\nhave made great strides in the area of human rights. Of\r\ngreat significance are the major human rights treaties which\r\nhave been adopted and which include the Convention on\r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The\r\nbattle to make human rights truly universal has regrettably\r\nnot been won decisively, although there is no doubt that we\r\nare on the way to achieving that goal. We therefore need to\r\nredouble our efforts to pursue it.\r\nIn the post-cold-war era, attention has unfortunately\r\nbeen focused almost exclusively on civil and political\r\nrights, with less attention being paid to economic, social\r\nand cultural rights. That development is a human right is\r\noften forgotten. Such a narrow approach misses the\r\nimportant link that exists between the enjoyment of civil\r\nand political rights and development. The Declaration on\r\nthe Right to Development was intended to emphasize such\r\na link but, regrettably, this latest of recognized rights has\r\nyet to be factored into our human rights programmes.\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, no topic is of\r\ngreater significance than the establishment of a permanent\r\nInternational Criminal Court. Over 50 years ago, this idea\r\nwas conceived out of the realization that domestic courts\r\nare often inadequate to deter crimes under international law,\r\nresulting in impunity for perpetrators of human rights\r\nabuses. The adoption of the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court less than three months ago\r\nwas the culmination of a long battle fought by courageous\r\nmen and women for justice. The Statute is therefore our\r\nproud bequest to future generations.\r\nOver the years of negotiation on the Rome Statute,\r\nLesotho always affirmed the need for a court in which we\r\ncould have faith: an effective, independent and impartial\r\nCourt that enjoyed universal acceptance. In order to\r\nachieve this, a number of thorny and sensitive issues had\r\nto be resolved over the five-week period of the Rome\r\nConference. While not everything that we had hoped for\r\nhas been included in the Statute, we believe that the\r\npositive aspects of the Statute far outweigh its negative\r\nelements.\r\nIf, in the years ahead, there is to be greater respect\r\nfor international law and international humanitarian law,\r\nall States will have to take the International Criminal\r\nCourt seriously and adopt measures to ensure the coming\r\ninto operation of the court without delay. We thus urge\r\nthe Secretary-General to convene the Preparatory\r\nCommission in early 1999 to begin work on the rules of\r\nprocedure and evidence, guidelines for the court on the\r\nelements of crimes, the headquarters agreement and other\r\ninstruments. We also call upon the Assembly to endorse\r\nthe Rome Statute and urge States to ratify it in sufficient\r\nnumbers so that the court can start its work. Lesotho\r\nremains ready to work towards the accomplishment of\r\nthese tasks.\r\nDuring the current session of the General Assembly\r\nand the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nrecently held in Durban, South Africa, the concern of the\r\ninternational community has focused on the phenomenon\r\nof globalization, an issue of particular importance for the\r\nleast developed countries. The liberalization of trade\r\nregimes and the promotion of an open and secure\r\nmultilateral trading system are central requirements for\r\nthe promotion of economic development.\r\nWhile the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations has resulted in significant improvements in\r\nmarket access conditions for the majority of countries of\r\nthe world, the expected gains for the least developed\r\ncountries from the stimulus to world trade arising from\r\nthe Uruguay Round are less clear. These countries\r\ncontinue to face significant obstacles to market access for\r\ntheir exports. There are still tariff peaks and tariff\r\nescalations against their major export items. Furthermore,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nsome standards are too difficult to meet due to the\r\ndifferences in technological advancement.\r\nThe problems enumerated above attest to the\r\nimportance of the United Nations in shaping a world of\r\npeace, prosperity and development. A question that has\r\nplagued the United Nations since its founding has been that\r\nof disarmament, and in particular nuclear disarmament.\r\nNuclear weapons pose a serious threat to all humanity and\r\nits habitat, yet they remain in the arsenals built up during\r\nthe height of the cold war. Their time has passed, yet\r\nassertions of their utility continue. Nuclear weapons are\r\nheld by a handful of States which insist that these weapons\r\nprovide security benefits, and yet reserve uniquely to\r\nthemselves the right to own them. This situation is highly\r\ndiscriminatory, unstable and untenable. The possession of\r\nnuclear weapons by any State is a constant stimulus to\r\nother States to acquire them. For these reasons, it is a\r\ncentral reality that nuclear weapons diminish the security of\r\nall States.\r\nThe recent testing of nuclear weapons by India and\r\nPakistan was a self-fulfilling prophecy. As much as we\r\ndeplore the measures taken by these two countries, we must\r\nnot lose sight of the fact that they have been led down that\r\npath by the resistance of nuclear-weapons States to fulfil\r\ntheir obligations towards negotiating in good faith for a\r\ntotal ban of all nuclear weapons. We call upon all nuclear-\r\nweapons States to respond to the wishes of all humanity to\r\nban nuclear weapons from human experience by negotiating\r\na binding treaty for such a ban.\r\nLesotho supports the efforts of the Secretary-General\r\ntowards reforming the United Nations Organization. There\r\nis general agreement that the Security Council must be\r\nmade more democratic and its working methods more\r\ntransparent. For the great majority of States, the United\r\nNations is an indispensable tool for the realization of our\r\ndream for collective security and development. We are\r\ntherefore troubled that the efforts to reform the\r\nOrganization are bogged down in the most crucial area,\r\nnamely, the reform of the Security Council. The Charter\r\nhas conferred on that organ the most important\r\nresponsibility for international peace and security. The\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform has been\r\nworking for almost five years without reaching a\r\nconclusion. The time has now come for a negotiating text\r\nto be prepared and for negotiations to commence.\r\nOtherwise, the whole exercise will turn into a charade in\r\nwhich all will lose interest.\r\nThe scourge of conflicts in Africa continues to\r\nundermine efforts towards economic and social\r\ndevelopment in that continent. Lesotho is deeply\r\nconcerned by the failure of UNITA to comply with the\r\nagreed timetable for the resolution of the conflict in\r\nAngola, in accordance with the provisions of the Lusaka\r\nProtocol and the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe thus call on the international community, and the\r\nSecurity Council in particular, to assume its responsibility\r\nto apply firmly and resolutely the measures decreed by\r\nthe Council, especially within the context of resolutions\r\n1135 (1997) and 1173 (1998). Lesotho, as a member of\r\nSADC, supports the resolution of the recent SADC\r\nsummit in Mauritius, which held Mr. Savimbi accountable\r\nfor the resumption of hostilities in that country and thus\r\ndeclared him a political criminal.\r\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo is another source of concern to the Government of\r\nLesotho. This situation has seriously jeopardized efforts\r\nat consolidating peace, security and stability in the Great\r\nLakes region. Lesotho supports all efforts aimed at\r\npromoting a climate of peace and security in that region,\r\nincluding the SADC initiative as carried out by\r\nZimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.\r\nFinally, we remain disappointed by the slow pace of\r\nefforts at finding a lasting solution to the long-running\r\nproblem of Western Sahara. We therefore appeal to all\r\nparties concerned to respect and commit themselves to the\r\nletter and spirit of the United Nations settlement plan,\r\nwithin the context of the Houston accord, so that the\r\npeople of Western Sahara can at last join the rest of the\r\ninternational community as a peaceful, democratic and\r\nstable society as we move across the threshold of the next\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nnext speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Congo,\r\nMr. Rodolphe Adada, to whom I give the floor.\r\nMr. Adada (Congo) (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is a pleasure for me to convey to you, Sir, the\r\nsatisfaction of the delegation of Congo at seeing you\r\nconducting our work. Your unanimous election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly not only denotes recognition by the\r\ninternational community of your great qualities as a\r\nstatesman and experienced diplomat, but also attests to the\r\nimportant role played by your country, Uruguay, in the\r\nmaintenance of peace in the world.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nMr. President, I wish to convey to you and to the\r\nother members of the Bureau our heartfelt, sincere\r\ncongratulations and to assure you of the full cooperation of\r\nthe delegation of Congo. I should like also to pay well-\r\ndeserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko, for the competence and open-mindedness with\r\nwhich he conducted the work of the previous session.\r\nFinally, I wish to express the appreciation of our\r\ndelegation to the Secretary-General of our Organization,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, in a world where violence, injustice\r\nand frustration predominate, has been tirelessly striving to\r\nassert the virtues of dialogue and tolerance and to promote\r\npeace and development. Peace and development: these two\r\nideals have for decades posed a major challenge to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIt is very difficult to take the floor after all of the\r\noutstanding and talented speakers who have spoken from\r\nthis rostrum. What more could I add to all of the points so\r\neloquently made about Africa and the rest of the world?\r\nFor more than a decade now, Africa has made the\r\nheadlines only as the result of crises and conflicts: civil\r\nwars, inter-State wars, drought, famine and epidemics. All\r\nof these obstacles so impede the development of our\r\ncontinent that we cannot but wonder whether Africa will be\r\nentering the third millennium on the wrong foot.\r\nUnfortunately, Congo, my country, is an example of\r\nthis. A year ago, Congo had been in the throes of a civil\r\nwar for five long months. The international community and\r\nour Organization in particular strove hard to find a\r\nnegotiated solution to the conflict. We wish to pay tribute\r\nto the commendable efforts made by the Secretary-General\r\njointly with a numerous African heads of State.\r\nUnfortunately, we all know that these efforts were\r\nunsuccessful.\r\nWe are convinced that respect for the state of law and\r\ngood governance remain, in a sound economic environment,\r\na prerequisite for the well-being of our peoples. And it is\r\nbecause they did not understand this point that the former\r\nruling class imposed on the peaceful citizens of my country\r\ntwo civil wars in the space of five years, the latest of\r\nwhich — that of 1997 — was the most deadly and the most\r\ndevastating.\r\nWe do not intend to dwell on the many ways the\r\nformer regime violated the rules of democracy, even if this\r\nwould be helpful in understanding the causes of the tragic\r\nevents that my country has experienced.\r\nToday the war is over. Congo is resolutely looking\r\nto the future. The future means national reconciliation; it\r\nmeans rebuilding our devastated country; it means\r\nresuming the democratic process.\r\nFrom 5 to 14 January last, a national forum was held\r\nat Brazzaville to study practical modalities to attain these\r\ngoals. That forum, which brought together more than\r\n1,400 participants representing all segments of Congolese\r\nsociety, established a transitional Parliament and set the\r\nduration for this transitional period at three years.\r\nThe Government of National Unity and Public\r\nSalvation is now concentrating on the following priorities:\r\nthe reconciliation of all the sons and daughters of the\r\ncountry; the rehabilitation of our infrastructure; the\r\nrestoration of State administration; the resumption of the\r\ndemocratic process — census-taking started again last\r\nAugust; the reorganization of our national economy with,\r\ninter alia, the privatization of the major State companies;\r\nand the resumption of negotiations with international\r\nfinancial institutions, which concluded in June this year\r\nwith the adoption of a post-conflict programme.\r\nToday, in the light of the results obtained, we can\r\nstate that the transitional timetable will be respected.\r\nThese encouraging results have yet to be\r\nconsolidated, and our country is still fragile because of\r\nthe turmoil in the subregion.\r\nThe events taking place in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo cause great concern to my country, since\r\nour stability largely depends on that of our neighbours. I\r\ntherefore want to reaffirm the Congolese Government’s\r\ncommitment to respect the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our\r\ncountry will never serve as a base of operations for the\r\ndestabilization of this fraternal country.\r\nUnderstanding the costs of civil war and anxious to\r\ncontribute to finding a political solution to this crisis,\r\nCongo (Brazzaville) has been working with its various\r\ncontacts among all the States of the subregion. This was\r\nthe case in Durban during the summit of the Non-Aligned\r\nCountries, when President Denis Sassou Nguesso met\r\nmost of his counterparts, and more recently in Libreville,\r\nat the summit of Central African heads of State.\r\nOur country intends to honour its commitments\r\nunder the relevant provisions of Conventions of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nrelating to refugees and displaced persons. Therefore, I\r\nmust solemnly repudiate the false allegations by certain\r\nmedia of a supposed agreement between the Governments\r\nof the two Congos to transfer displaced Rwandans located\r\nin Congo (Brazzaville) to Congo (Kinshasa) so that they\r\ncan participate in the war. The displaced Rwandans living\r\nin Congo (Brazzaville) are in fact under the control of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, and any movement of them is taking place\r\nwithout the support of our Government, which wishes to\r\ninform the international community that it refuses to accept\r\nany responsibility for the consequences.\r\nIn Angola the hopes aroused by the Lusaka Protocol\r\nhave been continually dashed by the bad faith and sudden\r\nreversals of position of Mr. Jonas Savimbi, who is thereby\r\ntaking a whole segment of the Angolan people hostage,\r\ndenying them the opportunity to pursue development tasks.\r\nMy country firmly supports the Angolan Government in its\r\nefforts to achieve lasting peace in the country and to\r\nfinalize rapidly and completely the implementation of the\r\nLusaka Accords. My country completely supports the\r\ndecision adopted by the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity heads of State or Government in Mauritius,\r\ndescribing Mr. Jonas Savimbi as the person solely\r\nresponsible for the deterioration of the situation in Angola\r\nand calling upon other States to refrain from providing any\r\nsupport for Mr. Jonas Savimbi and his militarist wing.\r\nI would like to take this occasion to pay tribute to the\r\nmemory of Alioune Blondin Beye, a worthy son of Africa,\r\nwho gave the best of himself, including making the\r\nsupreme sacrifice, in the search for peace in Angola.\r\nAs regards other hot spots, the Congo always\r\nadvocates negotiated solutions. Therefore, we welcome the\r\nceasefire in Guinea-Bissau, and we hope that it will be used\r\nto work out a final solution to that conflict.\r\nThe same goes for the conflict between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea; in this regard, we support the efforts of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity mediation committee.\r\nWe cannot overlook the crises and tensions prevailing\r\nin other parts of the world, notably in the Middle East,\r\nwhere the peace process relaunched by the Oslo Accords is\r\nnow stalled, but also in South Asia, where the recent\r\nnuclear tests conducted by India and then Pakistan have\r\nheightened the already high level of tension.\r\nThe establishment of just and lasting peace in the\r\nworld requires full recognition of the destabilizing factors\r\nas well as of the real solutions to development problems.\r\nOne only needs recall the extent to which peace and\r\ndevelopment are linked.\r\nIn the light of the changes in the world, and after\r\nmore than half a century of existence, the United Nations\r\nseems to be gradually and dangerously moving away from\r\nthe vision of its founding fathers. Solidarity seems to be\r\ngiving way to a selfishness that has no time for\r\nsolidarity. This new trend is making increasingly\r\ndifficult the management of economic questions, which\r\nhave already been the subject of much thought, without\r\nproducing any prospect of an improvement in the living\r\nstandards of the peoples of most of our States.\r\nViolence, famine, disease and poverty continue to\r\nafflict our peoples. The underlying causes of these\r\nscourges are constantly the subject of a multitude of\r\nstudies and various economic stimulation and\r\ndevelopment programmes, but without result, because of\r\na lack of real commitment by the international\r\ncommunity. The Agenda for Development, the\r\ninternational strategy for the development of Africa, the\r\nSecretary-General’s System-wide Special Initiative on\r\nAfrica — to cite merely those examples — are just so\r\nmany plans that no longer give reason for optimism.\r\nToday globalization is supposed to be the panacea.\r\nThis at least is the philosophy of worldwide liberalization.\r\nBut how can we be confident when the export\r\nopportunities for the developing countries are often\r\nneutralized by protectionism in a new guise, which uses\r\nvarious pretexts — technical standards, environmental and\r\nsocial concerns, or even concerns about human rights?\r\nHow can we be confident when official development\r\nassistance continues to decline? How can we be sure\r\nwhen the weakest economies are bending beneath the\r\nburden of debt?\r\nWith regard to Africa, we believe that through\r\neconomic integration we can mitigate the undesirable\r\neffects of globalization. Through greater solidarity we can\r\nhope to meet the challenges we face.\r\nThis year the international community is\r\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. It is very significant that\r\nthis anniversary coincides with the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, which our Government\r\nconsiders to be a major step forward. We believe that this\r\nevent puts the finishing touch to the magnificent edifice\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nthat the founding fathers began constructing more than 50\r\nyears ago.\r\nBut today’s United Nations is not the same as the old\r\none. Where once there were only a few dozen Member\r\nStates, today there are 185. The problems of peace and\r\ndevelopment are not what they were in 1945. It is time to\r\nreview the management of our communal house. It is time\r\nto reform the Organization, including the Security Council.\r\nIt is time to democratize the Organization in order to better\r\nadapt it to the requirements of the coming millennium.\r\nI cannot conclude without expressing the compassion\r\nof the Congolese Government and those affected by the\r\ncalamity now afflicting the Caribbean and the southern\r\nUnited States as a result of hurricane Georges. This wanton\r\nunleashing of the forces of nature reminds us that we are\r\nall, large and small, in the same boat — our planet\r\nEarth — and that we must show solidarity to one another.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\nnext on His Excellency Mr. Blagoj Handziski, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the former Yusoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia.\r\nMr. Handziski (the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): Allow me first of all to congratulate you,\r\nMr. Opertti, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-third session and, at the same time, to\r\nwish you success in the performance of your important\r\nfunction.\r\nYour predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\r\nsuccessfully headed the fifty-second session. I am\r\nconvinced that, as a distinguished Latin American politician\r\nof great experience and energy, you will also make an\r\noutstanding contribution to the successful outcome of this\r\nsession.\r\nAllow me also to express our deep appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his leadership and to\r\nextend to him our readiness for full cooperation.\r\nIt is my special pleasure to address this Assembly on\r\nbehalf of the Republic of Macedonia. My country managed\r\nto avoid the turmoil of the war on the former Yugoslav\r\nterritory and to achieve its independence peacefully. We\r\nalso managed not only to maintain our internal peace and\r\nstability but also to produce peace and stability in the\r\ntroubled and volatile region of the Balkans. Under much\r\nmore difficult conditions than those prevailing in the other\r\ncountries in transition, we managed not only to finalize the\r\nreforms of the political and economic systems, but also to\r\ndemocratize society, to build the institutions of the state\r\nof law and to put into full function the mechanisms of\r\nmarket economy. In addition, we managed to emerge\r\nfrom the deep financial and economic crisis resulting\r\nfrom the high price we had to pay for these radical\r\nreforms, and, above all, from the losses we suffered due\r\nto the war in the region and the sanctions against our\r\nneighbour, Yugoslavia.\r\nAccording to the last report of the World Bank, the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, among all the countries in\r\ntransition, today shares first place with Estonia in the\r\nresults on macroeconomic plans and is in fourth place in\r\nthe field of structural reforms. Over a number of years,\r\nmy country has had a stable currency and an annual\r\ninflation rate of about 5 per cent, and this year has had an\r\nindustrial production growth rate of over 10 per cent. The\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, through its policy of equally\r\ngood relations with all its neighbours, has managed to\r\nestablish outstanding relations with almost all of them,\r\nparticularly with the Republic of Slovenia, the Republic\r\nof Croatia, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\r\nRepublic of Turkey, the Hellenic Republic and the\r\nRepublic of Albania. It has also managed to become one\r\nof the most active countries in all of the regional\r\ninitiatives in South-Eastern Europe.\r\nHaving committed itself to full integration into the\r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic structures, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia is investing great efforts to enhance its\r\nrelations with the European Union and to fully integrate\r\nitself into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), thus contributing to the establishment of the\r\nnew Euro-Atlantic security architecture and to the united\r\nEurope of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia has achieved all of this\r\nin a region in which, as is well known, we cannot yet\r\nspeak of lasting peace and stability, due to the crisis in\r\nBosnia, the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo,\r\nthe recent events in Albania and the stalled processes of\r\ndemocratization in some of the neighbouring countries.\r\nOther factors are the threats posed by illicit drug-\r\ntrafficking, money-laundering, the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and small arms,\r\ntransnational and local terrorism and so forth.\r\nThese are only some of the issues that burden the\r\noverall situation in the region I come from, but these are\r\nalso issues that burden citizens worldwide. We still live\r\nin a period characterized by uncertainty and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nunpredictability. Local wars and ethnic conflicts continue.\r\nThe threat of weapons of mass destruction is increasingly\r\nalarming. Organized crime, illicit drug-trafficking and\r\nterrorism trouble the whole world. Financial and economic\r\ncrises have become more frequent than ever, as have\r\nenvironmental disasters.\r\nThese complex issues, together with the issue of\r\nglobalization, which marks the end of this century and will\r\nprevail in the coming one, as well as the issue of the\r\nreform of our Organization, are the main issues of debate\r\nat this session. That is why my country, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, attaches such enormous importance to this\r\nsession, with the expectation that the decisions to be\r\nadopted in those respects will improve our mutual\r\ncooperation and will strengthen the role of the United\r\nNations in the spirit of its Charter.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, our Organization will face\r\na lot of new challenges, which will differ from those we\r\nhave dealt with during the past decades. The appropriate\r\nresponse to these challenges requires even further\r\nglobalization of cooperation, through the United Nations,\r\nand we therefore should, in due time, do everything\r\npossible so that it will be prepared to tackle them.\r\nWe believe that the Secretary-General’s reform\r\nprogramme is an excellent basis for this. These reforms are\r\nin the interest of all Member States, and we therefore fully\r\nendorse them. We believe that they should bring about\r\nsubstantial improvement in the work of all the bodies\r\nwithin the United Nations family.\r\nIn that regard, we are in favour of the eventual\r\nincrease in the number of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, derived from and based\r\nupon real political relations among Member States.\r\nThe processes of globalization that have engulfed our\r\nplanet are irreversible. They enhance our possibilities for\r\nconfronting international threats jointly, but they should\r\nalso provide benefits for all participating countries. The\r\nUnited Nations is the only Organization which can define\r\nthe principles, norms and rules, and which can give\r\nguarantees that both the obligations and the benefits will be\r\nshared by all members of the international community.\r\nOnly in this way can we, all together, avoid the eventual\r\nnegative effects of these processes of globalization.\r\nAs a modest contribution in that regard, the Republic\r\nof Macedonia has submitted a draft resolution for this\r\nsession on the prevention of marginalization of small and\r\nweakened economies of developing countries and of\r\neconomies in transition.\r\nThe international community is witnessing many\r\nnew crises and conflicts, which most frequently turn into\r\nviolence of an unprecedented intensity and fierceness. The\r\nUnited Nations has all along been engaged in their\r\nprevention and management. The lessons learned from the\r\ncrisis of the region I come from have indicated that our\r\nOrganization, in dealing with them, needs to take the\r\nfollowing steps: first, concentrate on their root causes;\r\nsecondly, concentrate on early warning; thirdly, activate\r\npreventive diplomacy for peaceful settlement of these\r\ndisputes before violence arises; and fourthly, deploy\r\npreventive forces in the neighbouring regions or countries\r\nto prevent their eventual spillover.\r\nIn 1992, when the war in Bosnia was spreading,\r\nendangering the regions to the south, as well as my\r\ncountry, which was not yet a Member of the United\r\nNations, we requested the deployment of a preventive\r\nmission along our northern and western borders. The\r\nSecurity Council took a positive decision, and, as a result,\r\nthe first preventive United Nations mission, the United\r\nNations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), was\r\nborn.\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to express the\r\ngratitude of my people and my country for this wise\r\ndecision of the Security Council, to the troop-contributing\r\ncountries — the United States of America, Norway,\r\nSweden, Finland and Denmark — and to all the other\r\ncountries that have contributed to the stabilization of the\r\nsituation along our northern and western borders.\r\nAs members know, the UNPREDEP mission has all\r\nalong also acted as a deterrent to possible conflicts in the\r\nregion. This most successful preventive mission has\r\nalways enjoyed the support of our citizens, as well as of\r\nmy Government. We are particularly pleased that such\r\npositive assessments are contained in all the reports of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan.\r\nWe are convinced that last year’s crisis in Albania\r\nand the crisis in Kosovo, which has particularly\r\nintensified since the beginning of this year, would have\r\nhad much more negative consequences on peace and\r\nstability in the region had the UNPREDEP mission not\r\nstayed in the Republic of Macedonia or had its stay been\r\nterminated last year, as some had proposed. Therefore, I\r\nwould like to express our gratitude to all the States\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nmembers of the Security Council that adopted the resolution\r\nextending its stay.\r\nI would also like to point to the need for the\r\nUNPREDEP mission to stay in the Republic of Macedonia\r\nuntil the situation in neighbouring Albania stabilizes and the\r\nKosovo crisis is peacefully settled. As an immediate\r\nneighbour, we are most interested in this and therefore,\r\nthrough our constructive policy, we are trying to make our\r\nown contribution to the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to resolve the Kosovo crisis.\r\nEven though we see the solution in the framework of\r\nthe Republic of Serbia and within the internationally\r\nrecognized borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\r\nit is well known that conditions have not yet been created\r\nfor a lasting settlement. Therefore, we believe that the\r\ninterim solution proposed by the American diplomat\r\nChristopher Hill and the Contact Group will lead towards\r\nresolving this crisis. The sooner this temporary solution is\r\naccepted and implemented, the sooner will conditions be\r\ncreated for reaching a lasting settlement of the crisis in\r\nKosovo, as well as for eliminating this threat to the stability\r\nof the region.\r\nShould this not happen, as an immediate neighbour we\r\nare most concerned by possible new waves of refugees,\r\nwhich could destabilize not only the countries of the region,\r\nbut also those beyond. For the time being, this crisis has\r\nnot significantly affected the peace and stability of the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, in which there lives a considerable\r\nAlbanian minority. However, all of our citizens, regardless\r\nof their national or religious identity, are concerned by a\r\npossible deepening of the crisis.\r\nThough some initial steps have lately been made\r\ntowards settling the Kosovo crisis and broader conditions\r\nhave been established to that end — such as, for example,\r\nthe decision of the Defence Ministers of the Partnership for\r\nPeace and of States members of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) from South-East Europe, to establish\r\nthe first multinational brigade for peace support operations;\r\nor the positive results of such regional initiatives as the\r\nCentral European Initiative (CEI), the Royaumont Initiative,\r\nthe Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC), the Initiative\r\nof Cooperation of South-East Europe (SECI), and the\r\nprocess on security, stability and cooperation in South-\r\nEastern Europe — recent events in Kosovo, in which a\r\nnumber of citizens were massacred, will very negatively\r\naffect the overall security situation. We condemn all such\r\nuncivilized acts and underline that this is not the way to\r\novercome the disputes or to settle them peacefully.\r\nTherefore, we call for the full mobilization and\r\nharmonization of the activities of the international\r\ncommunity, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union and\r\nNATO, as well as our Organization, the United Nations,\r\nsince we believe that the possibilities for a peaceful\r\nsolution have not yet been exhausted. In that regard, my\r\ncountry has invested great efforts to make a constructive\r\ncontribution. As is known, at previous sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, three resolutions for the development\r\nof good-neighbourly relations in South-East Europe that\r\nwere proposed by the Republic of Macedonia were\r\nadopted unanimously.\r\nAt this session, we have submitted a proposal for the\r\nadoption of a new draft resolution on the prevention of\r\nthe violent disintegration of States. I hope that this draft\r\nresolution will also be adopted by acclamation. By this,\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia is making a concrete\r\ncontribution and giving strong support to the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations to establish early warning of eventual\r\nconflicts, achieve political settlements of outstanding\r\ndisputes, and avoid their short-, medium- and long-term\r\nconsequences.\r\nIn the period between the main parts of the fifty-\r\nsecond and fifty-third sessions of the General Assembly,\r\nour Organization undertook a great number of activities\r\nto resolve the current and to prevent the outbreak of new\r\ncrises. The measures that could greatly contribute to\r\npreventing such violent conflicts certainly include the\r\nprosecution of war criminals and the punishment of the\r\ncriminal acts and atrocities they have committed.\r\nThe successful completion of the Conference on the\r\ncreation of the International Criminal Court is of\r\nhistorical importance. The Republic of Macedonia has\r\nfully supported the outcome of the Rome Conference, as\r\nwell as the Statute that was adopted by the majority of\r\nthe attending countries, including my own. Now, the\r\nGeneral Assembly should adopt the necessary decisions\r\nto allow the Court to assume its full functions.\r\nIn that regard, no less important is the fact, that\r\nwithin a very short period of time, 40 countries, including\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia, have ratified the Ottawa\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\r\nTheir Destruction. Thus, the Republic of Macedonia has\r\nfirmly reaffirmed its commitment to the full elimination\r\nof anti-personnel landmines, just as it has, by investing\r\nenormous efforts, made a great contribution to preventing\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nthe proliferation of the small arms that abounded in the\r\nregion following last year’s crisis in Albania.\r\nHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law have\r\nproven to be the basic preconditions for the promotion of\r\npeace, security and the sustainable development of States.\r\nSince the very first days of its independence, the Republic\r\nof Macedonia has committed itself to the establishment of\r\nthese preconditions.\r\nToday, as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, we feel the need\r\nto particularly emphasize that the adoption of the\r\ndeclaration on the defenders of human rights will not only\r\ncreate new responsibilities for all the States Members of\r\nour Organization, but will also encourage all the activists\r\nwho work for the protection of human rights throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nAs a country whose Constitution abolishes the death\r\npenalty, we support the draft protocols to the Convention\r\nfor the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen and the Convention against Torture, as well as a\r\nbroad scope of projects and programmes in the field of\r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and so on.\r\nAllow me to conclude by reaffirming the firm\r\ncommitment of the Republic of Macedonia to the objectives\r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. We are a\r\nsmall country that struggles for progress and development\r\nwithin a still troubled and unstable region. Perhaps that is\r\nwhy we so strongly feel the threats and the challenges that\r\nare common to the whole world. Thus, each and every\r\nState Member of the United Nations, regardless of size and\r\nhuman potential, should make its contribution to decreasing\r\nthe risks of these threats and should also enjoy the benefits\r\nof the current processes of globalization. The survival of\r\neach State, of each people, of the whole planet depends on\r\nthe common solidarity among all of us and on our common\r\nresponsibility for future generations that could be united\r\nonly here, in our common Organization, the United Nations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker on my list is the First Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Eriya Kategaya.\r\nMr. Kategaya (Uganda): At the outset, I wish to\r\nconvey the apologies of President Yoweri Kaguta\r\nMuseveni, who was supposed to address the Assembly. He\r\nis unable to come to New York because of other pressing\r\nState duties.\r\nAllow me, on behalf of my delegation, to convey\r\nour warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. Let me pay a special tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the excellent\r\nmanner in which he presided over the work of the fifty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly. I wish also to\r\nthank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for all the\r\nendeavours he is undertaking in shaping our Organization\r\nto enable it to effectively meet the challenges of the next\r\nmillennium.\r\nMr. Filippi Balestra (San Marino), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe United Nations has been at the forefront of\r\nefforts to tackle problems of international peace and\r\nsecurity and social and economic development. It has\r\nhelped many communities around the world attain peace,\r\ngreater security and higher standards of living. Africa\r\nfaces a number of challenges which must be urgently\r\naddressed. It is a volatile region in which a multiplicity of\r\nconflicts have combined to create a very explosive\r\natmosphere. Refugee populations have multiplied to\r\nprovide a further recipe for future instability. The\r\nsituation has been further complicated by large numbers\r\nof internally displaced people. Indeed, a large political\r\nand humanitarian tragedy is taking place in the region.\r\nThere is therefore an urgent need for the international\r\ncommunity to support Africa’s efforts to address the\r\nfundamental causes of the conflict.\r\nIt has been alleged that ethnic differences are the\r\nprime causes of conflict in the region. My delegation does\r\nnot share this view. We believe that poor leadership,\r\npoverty and low levels of economic development in the\r\nregion are the main underlying causes. The leadership in\r\nour region must correctly define and analyse the root\r\ncauses of the problems and establish clear priorities. It is\r\nalso imperative that, for a permanent and durable peace\r\nto prevail in the region, a comprehensive programme of\r\neconomic recovery and development be implemented in\r\nAfrica. Concerted efforts must therefore be made to\r\nreduce and ultimately eradicate poverty in the world.\r\nIn this regard, Uganda had the honour of hosting a\r\nleaders’ forum in Kampala in January this year at which\r\nthe heads of State and Government of countries in the\r\neastern, southern and central regions of Africa met and\r\nheld discussions with the President of the World Bank.\r\nThat meeting, which in many ways was unique and\r\ninspiring, opened a new chapter in Africa’s relations with\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nthe Bank. It ushered in a genuine spirit of partnership\r\nbetween Africa and the Bank. Two of the significant\r\noutcomes of the meeting were, first, the decision that Africa\r\nwould be considered a priority development region by the\r\nWorld Bank and, secondly, a commitment to depoliticize\r\nforeign aid. It was also agreed at the meeting that African\r\ncountries must set their own priorities for development. It\r\nis the hope of my delegation that the agreements reached at\r\nthe Kampala leaders’ forum will be translated into concrete\r\naction by the international community in the near future.\r\nWe believe that similar initiatives could be undertaken\r\ntogether with other organs of the United Nations system.\r\nFor too long, international efforts have been expended\r\non short-term humanitarian programmes, ignoring the long-\r\nterm requirements for sustainable peace and development.\r\nPast experience has shown that this approach cannot ensure\r\ndurable peace and development. Indeed, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral noted in his report on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica,\r\n“Preventing such wars is no longer a matter of\r\ndefending States or protecting allies. It is a matter of\r\ndefending humanity”. (A/52/871, para. 3)\r\nConflict prevention, including post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding, requires a sustained effort to infuse funds into the\r\nregion. In this regard, we urge serious consideration and\r\nexpeditious implementation of the recommendations\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nThe massive cuts in social spending and public\r\ninvestments, with the attendant high levels of\r\nunemployment, create new centres of discontent and thus\r\nfurther fuel the embers of conflict. Attempts to impose\r\nconditionalities which are antithetical to the peace process\r\nand the cutting off of aid from weak Governments making\r\nsincere efforts to pursue reconciliation or implement peace\r\nagreements have been counterproductive. My delegation\r\nwould wish to argue for “peace-friendly” structural\r\nadjustment programmes, if durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment are to be achieved in Africa and elsewhere.\r\nA number of delegations have expressed their views\r\non the situation in the Great Lakes region with specific\r\nreference to the ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo. My country was specifically accused of\r\ninvolvement in the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. The facts of the situation in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo are not clear to some member States\r\nof this Assembly. Since, many speakers have raised this\r\nissue, we would like to make the following clarifications.\r\nUganda’s interest in the situation in the Great Lakes\r\nregion has always been and is still based on the\r\nfollowing: the need to ensure total security in all parts of\r\nUganda and the protection of the lives and property of the\r\npeople of Uganda; and the desire to ensure maximum\r\nstability in the Great Lakes region, because instability in\r\nany neighbouring country directly affects our security and\r\neconomy.\r\nThese concerns are legitimate. Our position on this\r\ncrisis therefore reflects our efforts to pursue those\r\ninterests. Before the fall of former President Mobutu, it\r\nwas not possible for Uganda to get cooperation from the\r\nthen Government in Zaire to ensure that Zairian territory\r\nwas not used by terrorist organizations to create insecurity\r\nalong the Uganda-Zaire border and inside Uganda.\r\nWhen President Laurent Kabila came to power it\r\nwas mutually agreed between Uganda and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo that our two armies would jointly\r\noperate in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo to contain and eventually remove the bandits\r\nwho were using the bases they had in the area to\r\ndestabilize Uganda. Pursuant to that understanding,\r\nUganda has since maintained a military presence in the\r\neastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in\r\naccordance with the provision of the bilateral agreement\r\nbetween our two countries. The situation in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo today necessitates that\r\nUganda must maintain that military presence, which is\r\ncrucial for the security of our country and our people.\r\nLet me make it clear to all and sundry that Uganda\r\nhas no territorial designs on the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo. It is not the primary responsibility of Uganda\r\nto dictate the political arrangements of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. However, any internal\r\narrangement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nwhich does not take into account the legitimate security\r\nconcerns of its neighbours is our concern. We would like\r\nto say that unilateral military intervention by individual\r\ncountries or sectional intervention by groups of countries\r\nis unacceptable. These actions are likely to escalate the\r\nproblem. If there are good reasons for an intervention, it\r\nshould be regional, carried out, for example, through the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC), the\r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\r\n(COMESA), the Organization of African Unity (OAU) or\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\neven the United Nations, and in the context of the peace\r\ninitiatives that are already in place.\r\nWe would therefore like to stress that there are serious\r\nregional efforts to address the situation in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. We believe these efforts should be\r\nsupported by the entire membership of this Organization\r\nand by all parties that are interested in the conflict and have\r\na vested interest in peace and security in the Great Lakes\r\nregion.\r\nUganda’s commitment to the full respect for and\r\nuniversal enjoyment of human rights is well known.\r\nHowever, we regret that crimes are now being committed\r\non a daily basis against the people of Uganda by surrogate\r\nforces of the so-called Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) with\r\nthe full knowledge and assistance of their sponsors, who do\r\nnot believe in freedom and respect for human rights.\r\nInnocent children are abducted daily, subjected to forced\r\nlabour and military service and made victims of other,\r\nsimilar crimes, with the support of the sponsors of these\r\nterrorist groups. The world awoke to this horrendous crime\r\nat the fifty-fourth session of the United Nations\r\nCommission on Human Rights, when it adopted draft\r\nresolution E/CN.4/1998/L.40, which calls upon the LRA\r\nand its sponsors to release all the abducted children\r\nimmediately and unconditionally.\r\nMy delegation believes that without external support\r\nthe Lord’s Resistance Army would not be in a position to\r\ncommit these atrocities and defy international public\r\nopinion on this extremely important matter. We call upon\r\nthe international community to intensify pressure on the\r\ncountries involved to stop backing these terrorists. On the\r\nother hand, we wish to thank the United Nations bodies,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and all others who have\r\nbeen involved in seeking the freedom of these children. We\r\nhope their efforts will not be in vain.\r\nThe United Nations is a vibrant institution for many\r\nreasons, among them its unwavering support for actions\r\naimed at advancing freedom, peace and security. Today,\r\nterrorism poses a serious threat to these values. Individuals\r\nand organizations whose stock in trade is the violation of\r\nthese values roam the globe with impunity. Recent attacks\r\nin East Africa came at a time when we thought the world\r\nhad learned the futility of such senseless, wanton murder\r\nand destruction. It is the firm belief of my delegation that\r\nthe international community should collectively take action\r\nto deny sanctuary to these savages. Countries known to\r\nharbour such elements should be isolated and punished\r\nseverely so that human freedom can be protected. My\r\ndelegation further believes that this is an opportune\r\nmoment to convene an international conference on\r\nterrorism which must map out strategies to deal with this\r\nescalating problem.\r\nLast year the world had only five declared nuclear\r\nStates; today we have seven; next year we may have\r\nmore. In essence, such non-proliferation agreements as the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) have not deterred the emergence of new nuclear\r\nStates.\r\nThe philosophy of dependence on nuclear weapons\r\nfor security is, in a creeping and disturbing fashion,\r\nbecoming universal. This situation is creating new dangers\r\nfor the survival of mankind. My delegation believes that\r\na new universal security doctrine needs to evolve. All\r\nnuclear weapons should be eliminated. In line with this\r\nbelief, my delegation calls for the adoption of an action\r\nplan for the elimination of all nuclear weapons within a\r\ntime-bound framework. Such an approach should be\r\nuniversal, and not regional or discriminatory, if it is to\r\nachieve the desired goals.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly,\r\nseveral developments have taken place in the international\r\narena, some of which have offered hope and\r\nencouragement, while others have led to destruction and\r\ndespair.\r\nThe issue of Western Sahara is of concern to my\r\ndelegation. We are concerned by the slow progress\r\ntowards the holding of a United Nations-supervised\r\nreferendum on the self-determination of the people of that\r\nterritory. We appeal to the parties to overcome their\r\ndifferences and allow a just and impartial referendum to\r\ntake place.\r\nOn the Lockerbie incident, Uganda welcomes the\r\ninitial moves taken in a bid to solve the problem between\r\nthe United States of America and the United Kingdom on\r\nthe one hand and Libya on the other. We encourage the\r\nSecretary-General to work out comprehensive and clear\r\narrangements, acceptable to all concerned parties, so that\r\nthe matter can finally be resolved.\r\nToday we live in a globalized world. Globalization\r\nhas created new opportunities as well as grave risks and\r\nchallenges. Its impact has strengthened the developed\r\ncountries and weakened the developing countries. Such a\r\nsituation does not augur well for international peace and\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nsecurity. There is an urgent need for deliberate policies to\r\nreorient international trade and finance. The crisis in South-\r\nEast Asia should serve as a warning to the world of the\r\ncatastrophe that inaction will breed. The ever widening gap\r\nbetween the developed and the developing countries and\r\namong countries in the South could also become a source\r\nof future instability. There should be no delay in addressing\r\nthese problems. My delegation calls upon the developed\r\ncountries to honour their obligations and increase the\r\ntransfer of resources to the developing countries for the\r\ntransformation of their economies, so that they may become\r\nequal partners in the global economy.\r\nIn the recent past, despite drastic limitations in both\r\nhuman and financial resources, the United Nations has\r\nresponded admirably to the challenges of the era, including\r\npeacekeeping, emergency operations and development. It\r\nhas a commendable record which should serve to strengthen\r\nour confidence in the Organization.\r\nAs we inch our way into the twenty-first century, we\r\nshould translate this confidence into the necessary political\r\nwill to strengthen the Organization. We should demonstrate\r\nour faith and dedication to the United Nations and its\r\ncomponent parts by providing it with the resources\r\nnecessary to fulfil its immense mandate. Our challenge is\r\nto bequeath to succeeding generations a strong United\r\nNations, able to guarantee the principles enshrined in the\r\npreamble of its Charter.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation\r\nof Sierra Leone, His Excellency Mr. Sama Banya.\r\nMr. Banya (Sierra Leone): Permit me to offer, on\r\nbehalf of President Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the\r\nGovernment and the people of Sierra Leone, our warm\r\nfelicitations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his unanimous election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession, and to express our delegation’s confidence that\r\nunder his able guidance our session will be a successful\r\none. We are in no doubt that his distinguished public record\r\nadequately equips him for the position he has been called\r\nupon to assume, and we have already seen evidence of this\r\nin the last two weeks. We must also express gratitude to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Udovenko of Ukraine, for a job well done.\r\nOur gratitude also goes to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and to the entire staff of the United Nations\r\ncommon system for their relentless efforts in helping the\r\npeople of Sierra Leone in the mammoth task of\r\nreconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement of hundreds\r\nof thousands of our compatriots who were the unfortunate\r\nvictims of nine months of junta misrule. Mr. Annan has\r\nput the international ship of state on the right course, and\r\nmy delegation wishes him continued success.\r\nThis time last year, my President addressed the\r\nAssembly on the subject of the situation in Sierra Leone.\r\nI am sure most members will remember the picture he\r\npainted of the tragic events and the turmoil that followed\r\nwhen a democratically elected Government was\r\noverthrown by a bunch of military adventurists, aided and\r\nabetted by some civilian opportunists who became their\r\nactive collaborators. Thanks to the resilience of the whole\r\nof civil society, encouraged and backed by the\r\ninternational community, I am here today representing the\r\nlegitimate, reinstated Government of Sierra Leone.\r\nAgainst all odds, our people defied the violent and\r\nmisguided gun-toting anarchists who appeared to have\r\none objective, and one only: the total destruction of the\r\ncivil society of Sierra Leone. Mercifully, that nightmare\r\nis now behind us.\r\nIn February this year, the forces of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG), under the then ECOWAS\r\nChairman, the late General Sani Abacha of Nigeria, led\r\nby Nigeria and with the support of our Civil Defence\r\nUnit, removed the junta. This was preceded by several\r\nattempts to arrive at a negotiated settlement. The\r\ninternational community was to learn that the junta and\r\ntheir allies, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), always\r\nnegotiated in bad faith and were not to be trusted.\r\nThe atrocities committed by the junta during their\r\nnine-month reign, especially after they retreated to the\r\neastern and northern parts of the country, had to be seen\r\nto be believed. Rape, murder, mutilation, vandalism and\r\nthe burning down of whole villages were the order of the\r\nday. Unarmed civilians, particularly women and children,\r\nwere their unfortunate victims.\r\nBecause of the wanton destruction perpetrated by the\r\njunta and, much earlier, by the RUF, there is a great need\r\nto revamp the economy and for reconstruction. In a report\r\nto the General Assembly, the Secretary-General referred\r\nto the Special Conference on Sierra Leone, which he\r\nconvened here at United Nations Headquarters on 30 July\r\nthis year. The international community was invited to\r\nfocus on the situation in Sierra Leone.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nWe were very much encouraged, not only by the\r\ndeliberations and results of that conference, but also by the\r\ndeliberations of the second ministerial-level Security\r\nCouncil meeting on Africa, held last week, in which Sierra\r\nLeone featured prominently.\r\nThe humanitarian crisis is immense: there are many\r\nrefugees and displaced persons. The disarmament and\r\ndemobilization exercise and the resettlement, rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction processes require many resources. Some\r\nof the pledges that were made are now being fulfilled, but\r\nmuch remains to be done.\r\nAllow me to echo the appeal of the Secretary-General\r\nto those who have yet to pledge, and to others who have\r\nyet to deliver, to do all they can to help us. In the\r\nmeantime, I would like to express profound gratitude to all\r\nmembers, and especially to the members of the contact\r\ngroup to be coordinated by the United Kingdom, for what\r\nhas been achieved so far.\r\nAs soon as the legitimate Government was\r\noverthrown, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), at\r\nits meeting in Harare in June 1997, unanimously\r\ncondemned the takeover and called on the junta to return\r\npower and constitutionality to the elected Government and\r\nto the country respectively. The prompt action of\r\nECOWAS, the resultant peace in Liberia and now the\r\nreturn of democracy to Sierra Leone, clearly demonstrate\r\nwhat a regional organization can achieve if the\r\ndetermination and the leadership are there. ECOMOG has\r\nthe capacity to deliver, but it needs the tools, which only\r\nthe international community can provide.\r\nMy country is fully aware that even though the Armed\r\nForces Revolutionary Council (AFRC)/RUF junta has been\r\nousted, the peace and security that were achieved with\r\nenormous sacrifice by the people of Sierra Leone have yet\r\nto be consolidated. It is therefore in the interests of the\r\npeople that the international community in general and the\r\nforces of the subregion in particular, maintain their presence\r\nin Sierra Leone until we can create a new national army. In\r\nthis regard, the Federal Republic of Nigeria has agreed to\r\nthe secondment of Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe,\r\nCommander of the ECOMOG Force in Sierra Leone, as our\r\nChief of Defence Staff. He is already working on the\r\nmodalities for forming a well-trained and dedicated army\r\nwhich will be alive to its responsibility as defender of our\r\nConstitution. I have every reason to believe that that\r\nassignment will be carried out with the same\r\nprofessionalism that has been the hallmark of ECOMOG\r\noperations in both Liberia and Sierra Leone.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to state that the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Sierra Leone is committed\r\nto the demobilization, disarmament and integration of all\r\nex-combatants, as provided for in both the Abidjan Peace\r\nAccord and the Conakry peace plan, despite the lack of\r\ngood faith that has been demonstrated by both the RUF\r\nand the junta. This programme is at the top of our post-\r\nconflict agenda, and the Disarmament Committee itself is\r\nunder the chairmanship of no less a person than our\r\nPresident.\r\nBecause of its overwhelming desire to uphold the\r\nprinciples of democracy and good governance, the\r\nGovernment lays much emphasis on the rule of law,\r\nhuman rights and freedom of expression. There are over\r\n48 newspaper publications in a country with 80 per cent\r\nilliteracy. Despite propaganda to the contrary, no\r\njournalists have been prosecuted, let alone convicted, for\r\npractising their profession — not even when the headlines\r\nof a few have sometimes bordered on libel. Of the 16\r\npeople recently convicted of treason, after a trial that was\r\ndeclared transparent and fair, five were journalists; but\r\nthey were not charged for the practice of journalism.\r\nPresident Kabbah and the ECOMOG Force\r\nCommander informed the Special Conference on Sierra\r\nLeone that more than 90 per cent of the country was\r\nsecure and safe. Remnants of the junta and the RUF are,\r\nhowever, perched in small areas in the east and north-east\r\nand operate only because they continue to have a safe\r\nhaven in a neighbouring country, while one other country\r\nrenders its support to them from outside Sierra Leone.\r\nThat notwithstanding, every effort is now being made by\r\nboth ECOMOG and the Civil Defence Unit to flush them\r\nout and to finally put this whole tragic affair behind us.\r\nThe treason trials of both civilians and former junta\r\nmembers are still in progress, under laws which have\r\nbeen in existence since independence. Soon after sentence\r\nwas passed on the first group, some misguided\r\norganizations began unfairly pressurizing the President to\r\nintervene; they even mounted a vicious propaganda\r\ncampaign in the name of human rights.\r\nMy country is governed by the rule of law. Under\r\nour constitution there is separation of powers between the\r\nexecutive, the legislature and the judiciary. While the due\r\nprocess of law is in progress, the President cannot and\r\nwill not interfere with it. At the end of the exercise those\r\nwho lose their final appeals to the Supreme Court can\r\napply to the Prerogative of Mercy Committee. Then, and\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nonly then, will the President step in, and he has already\r\ngiven that assurance.\r\nOur President has not only gone the extra mile, but is\r\nseen to be bending over backwards to bring together all the\r\nmain political groups into the mainstream of the post-\r\nconflict nation-building exercise, so as to secure permanent\r\npeace and security. There have been no instances of human\r\nrights violations since President Kabbah assumed office.\r\nWith regard to the armed rebellion in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and the rebel wars in Angola, Sudan\r\nand elsewhere, we appeal to the parties in those conflicts to\r\nlay down their arms, to refrain from further provocative\r\nactivities that ignite tempers and to give peace a chance.\r\nOur Government welcomes the successful outcome of\r\nthe United Nations Diplomatic Conference on the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, which\r\ntook place in Rome, Italy, in June 1998. Sierra Leone is\r\nfirmly committed to the early establishment of a permanent\r\ninternational court, and my Government has already signed\r\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court. We urge\r\nevery nation to sign and ratify the Statute. It will be not\r\nonly testimony to the common desire to overcome long\r\nneglected failures of national legal systems, but a unique\r\nchance to contribute to international stability deterrence\r\nand, hopefully, the prevention of atrocious crimes.\r\nSecurity Council reform is one of the most difficult\r\nissues which have to be tackled during this session. While\r\nprogress has been made in some areas, and new ideas and\r\nproposals have emerged, the Working Group has not\r\npresented recommendations to the General Assembly. Sierra\r\nLeone agrees with the position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement on the curtailment, limitation and subsequent\r\nelimination of the veto. Sierra Leone fully endorses the\r\ndecision of the Assembly of the Heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity for two\r\npermanent seats to be allocated to our continent.\r\nAs for the expansion of the Security Council, Sierra\r\nLeone supports the position taken by the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, that, in order to enhance its credibility, the new\r\nCouncil should reflect the universal character of the world\r\nand correct existing imbalances in its composition.\r\nMy country cannot talk of conflicts and peace without\r\nreferring to nuclear arms. When negotiations were being\r\nconducted in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty, a\r\nfew years ago, the Republic of Sierra Leone was one of\r\nthose countries which prayed silently for its success. We\r\nare relieved and thankful that the Treaty has been signed\r\nby a large number of countries. We continue to call on all\r\nnations to sign the test-ban treaty and refrain from further\r\ntests, with their attendant danger to the future of mankind.\r\nIn the same way as we oppose all future nuclear\r\ntests, we must with all the emphasis at our disposal\r\ncondemn all forms of terrorism, both domestic and\r\ninternational. We refer particularly to the recent bombings\r\nwhich claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent people,\r\nnot to mention the loss of property worth millions of\r\ndollars in Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam, Cape Town and\r\nNorthern Ireland. We call on the international community\r\nto coordinate its efforts to fight this menace. Those who\r\ninsist on using this method to achieve their aims should\r\nbe tracked down and brought to justice. In this regard, my\r\ncountry wholeheartedly supports the signing and\r\nratification of all the Conventions on terrorism and\r\nappeals to the entire international community to adhere to\r\nthe Conventions in order to make the world a safer place\r\nfor our children’s children.\r\nMy Government noted with great delight the\r\nconference convened last year in South Africa to focus\r\nthe world’s attention on the dangers posed to human life\r\nby landmines. We revive the memory of the late Princess\r\nDiana, who did so much to focus the attention of the\r\ninternational community on the horrors of landmines. In\r\nour own country, too, landmines were strewn around with\r\ncarefree abandon by the AFRC/RUF junta, resulting in\r\nthe maiming and death of innocent civilians, especially\r\nchildren.\r\nMany African and other third world countries,\r\nincluding my own, are today still grappling with severe\r\neconomic problems. The effects of the debt burden, the\r\nunfavourable balances of trade and payment, and the\r\nunpredictability of the prices of their products on the\r\nworld market have all contributed to the deteriorating\r\neconomic conditions they are facing. In addition to these\r\nexternal factors, misguided policies and political\r\ninstability caused by various kinds of civil strife have\r\ncaused their economies to sink further. Globalization and\r\ntrade liberalization have become inevitable phases in\r\nworld trade. It has, however, become obvious that our\r\ncountries have fared badly and will continue to be at a\r\ndisadvantage unless there is a change of attitude and even\r\nprocedure on the part of developed, industrialized\r\ncountries. The resultant imbalances can be overcome if\r\nevery effort is made to create a level playing field by\r\nremoving the debt burden of our countries and opening up\r\nmarkets to African and third world products. Some\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\ncountries have already done so; we hope that others will\r\nfollow soon.\r\nI have already mentioned the refugee situation in my\r\nown country. It is grim, and yet the situation is the same in\r\nother parts of the world, especially Africa, which has the\r\nlargest refugee populations. This situation has continued to\r\nexert tremendous pressure on the already weak economies\r\nof the host countries, which are forced to spend part of\r\ntheir meagre resources on the welfare of refugees. Having\r\ngone through this experience both as recipient and exporter\r\nof refugees, we must commend the donor community and\r\nespecially the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Much is being done\r\nfor us, but even the Office acknowledges that the situation\r\nof our refugees in neighbouring countries is desperate. I\r\nwould like to appeal to the donor community to shed its\r\ndonor fatigue syndrome and continue to respond positively\r\nto the needs of a people who are the innocent victims of\r\nevents not of their own making. A very urgent need now is\r\nfor the repatriation of our people from neighbouring\r\ncountries, where life in camps is now a nightmare.\r\nSierra Leone is one of the countries in our subregion\r\nthat still have the remnants of what were once the Upper\r\nGuinea rain forest, which stretches from Sierra Leone down\r\nto the Cameroons. The reserve supports the largest number\r\nof animal species in Sierra Leone: a total of 46 mammal\r\nspecies, including Western chimpanzees, red colobus\r\nmonkeys, Diana monkeys, duickers, leopards and forest\r\nelephants. Two hundred and seventy four species of birds\r\nare to be found in the Gola rain forest. These include 10\r\nglobally threatened species — 8 restricted to the Upper\r\nGuinea forest block — and 169 forest-dependent species.\r\nThere is a very rich diversity of interesting invertebrates,\r\nincluding two species of dragonfly, endemic only to parts\r\nof the Upper Guinea forest, as well as the rare African\r\nswallow-tailed butterfly, which has Sierra Leone as the\r\nwesternmost limit of its range in Africa.\r\nUnfortunately, the Gola rain forest, like most other\r\nforest areas on the continent, is under considerable pressure.\r\nMuch of the forest cover is lost annually from logging and\r\nfrom brush burning as well as shifting cultivation carried\r\nout by an ever-increasing population. Conservation of these\r\nforests in Sierra Leone, as in other parts of Africa, is linked\r\nwith poverty. The Forestry Division of our Ministry of\r\nAgriculture and the Environment has a Gola Rain Forest\r\nConservation Programme. The programme is being operated\r\nin collaboration with a local non-governmental organization,\r\nthe Conservation Society of Sierra Leone, the Sierra Leone\r\npartner of Birdlife International, which sponsors the\r\nprogramme.\r\nNotwithstanding this valuable work, pressure on\r\nforests in the third world will not be reduced unless we\r\nenhance food production from the same piece of land year\r\nafter year, as happens in the industrialized countries. This\r\ncan only be achieved by a transfer of food production\r\ntechnology to our own countries.\r\nI have made frequent references to the role of the\r\ninternational community in the restoration of democracy\r\nto my country and to the reinstatement of President\r\nKabbah. I have mentioned the United Nations, the OAU,\r\nECOWAS and the Commonwealth. I would like to make\r\nspecial reference to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP).\r\nThe restoration of constitutional order and the\r\nvarious efforts of the Government to effect durable peace\r\nand to rebuild the country provide us with an opportunity\r\nto regain donor confidence and ensure the completion of\r\nvarious initiatives and programmes interrupted by the\r\nevents of the coup of 25 May 1997.\r\nAs lead agency in the partnership between the\r\nGovernment and the donor community, the UNDP, prior\r\nto the coup, had spearheaded the following: preparation\r\nof a national poverty-eradication programme; facilitating\r\nthe establishment of a coordination mechanism for relief\r\nassistance by the humanitarian community; and\r\nfacilitating the peace process through the provision of\r\ndiplomatic, logistic, technical and administrative support\r\nto the peace negotiations and the preparation of the\r\ndemobilization programme. Since the return of the elected\r\nGovernment in March 1998, the UNDP has spent\r\nconsiderable amounts of money in the development of\r\nvarious other programmes as well. I urge the international\r\ncommunity to continue its support for these programmes\r\nand to help us in our task of rehabilitation.\r\nLet me close by referring again to the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, whom I have already thanked. I shall\r\nrefer once more to the special conference he convened,\r\nfor which I thank the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Acting President: The next speaker is His\r\nExcellency Mr. Casimir Oye Mba, Minister of State,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Gabon.\r\nMr. Mba (Gabon) (interpretation from French): I\r\nwish first to convey to Mr. Didier Opertti the warm,\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nsincere congratulations of the Government and the\r\ndelegation of Gabon on his well-deserved election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. This is a tribute to his country, Uruguay, and an\r\nunambiguous recognition of his personal and professional\r\nqualities. Our congratulations go also to all the other\r\nAssembly officers, and we wish them every success in\r\nguiding our work. We assure them of the support and\r\ncooperation of the delegation of Gabon.\r\nTo the President of the General Assembly at the fifty-\r\nsecond session, Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko, who spared no\r\neffort in carrying out his responsibilities, I convey our\r\nsatisfaction and our deep gratitude.\r\nThe present times are characterized by political\r\ntension, by change and by socio-economic upheaval\r\nexacerbated by a grave financial crisis; our involvement is\r\nrequired, in more than one respect. Gabon remains\r\nconvinced that the United Nations continues to be the best\r\nforum for working together to harmonize our different\r\napproaches towards peace and development. We owe it to\r\nourselves to consider the circumstances in which the\r\nOrganization was established to free the world from the\r\nspectre of war. Was it just to prevent world war, or was it\r\nto make use of the renewed humanism inspired by the San\r\nFrancisco Conference to eradicate all the causes of armed\r\nconflict wherever they might emerge so as, in the words of\r\nthe Charter, “to promote social progress and better\r\nstandards of life in larger freedom”?\r\nNow more than in the past, and especially since the\r\nend of the cold war, narrow nationalism has been\r\nresurfacing to nullify all the international community’s\r\nefforts to make of our world a global village in which\r\npeace and security, friendship among nations and\r\ninternational cooperation are the watchwords. Peace is a\r\nsine qua non for the development of peoples and of nations.\r\nThat truth is easy enough to affirm, but applying it is\r\ncomplicated by the play of interests within States, often\r\ncombined with outside interference.\r\nThis has been and remains the bitter experience of\r\nAfrica. For nearly a decade, the African continent has faced\r\nmultifaceted political tension and violence between and\r\nwithin States, just when the end of the cold war had given\r\nrise to hope that resources would be mobilized for its\r\ndevelopment.\r\nYet during that same period many African countries\r\nhave courageously embarked on political reform and\r\neconomic restructuring. Overall, there has been tangible\r\nprogress. Clearly, stability is indispensable for such\r\nprogress, which means that questions of international\r\npeace and security are the concern of the day on our\r\ncontinent, and more specifically in Central Africa. That\r\nsubregion, so rich in potential, has come since the end of\r\nthe cold war to be a world disrupted by “the disorder of\r\nnations”, fuelled and maintained by a variety of forces.\r\nAlthough living in peace within its borders and with\r\nits neighbours, Gabon is extremely concerned at this\r\nsituation. President Bongo believes that our country\r\ncannot remain an isle of peace, freedom and even relative\r\nprosperity in an ocean of misery, violence and fratricidal\r\nwars. That concern is shared by the other heads of State\r\nof Central Africa, and was at the root of the summit\r\nconference held on Thursday, 24 September 1998, at\r\nLibreville, at the initiative of President Bongo, on the\r\nsituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That\r\nimportant meeting gave heads of State and heads of\r\ndelegation an opportunity to express their support for\r\nPresident Kabila and to condemn the aggression against\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of that country. They\r\ncalled for the withdrawal of foreign forces of aggression;\r\nfor a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\r\nfor respect for the territorial integrity of that country; and\r\nfor continuing the process of democratization begun by\r\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nThey also stressed the need for concerted action by\r\nthe countries of Central Africa, the States members of the\r\nSouthern African Development Community, of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and of the United Nations,\r\nand all those who are working to find a solution to the\r\nCongo crisis, renouncing any partisan decisions that could\r\nprolong the suffering of the peoples of Congo and of\r\nneighbouring States. The heads of State and heads of\r\ndelegation of Central Africa therefore decided to establish\r\na summit follow-up and negotiating committee under the\r\nchairmanship of the President of the Gabonese Republic,\r\nand reaffirmed that it would be appropriate to establish a\r\nregional peacekeeping force.\r\nTurning to Angola, I wish first to honour the\r\nmemory of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, and of members\r\nof his team, who worked tirelessly for peace in that\r\ncountry, tragically giving their lives to that cause. The\r\nheads of State and of delegation reaffirmed at the\r\nLibreville summit their support for the Government of\r\nAngola, which is sparing no effort in the search for\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nlasting peace in that country and for the full and speedy\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka accords.\r\nFinally, with regard to the Republic of the Congo, the\r\nheads of State supported the reconstruction and national\r\nreconciliation efforts and condemned the destabilization\r\nmanoeuvres originating outside the country.\r\nOf course, we are not insensitive to the disturbances\r\nand violence occurring in other parts of the world — quite\r\nthe contrary. Gabon shares the position of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) on ways and means of resolving\r\nthe problems in Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and\r\nSomalia and between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We are\r\nfollowing most attentively the resumption of dialogue\r\nbetween the Israelis and Palestinians, as seen in the recent\r\nsummit meetings. These talks offer a glimmer of hope for\r\na global settlement of the problems of the Middle East. We\r\nlikewise believe that only political means will return peace\r\nto Afghanistan. With the same conviction, we encourage the\r\nefforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN) to preserve peace in South-East Asia.\r\nA global vision of peace is certainly necessary. In fact,\r\nthrough the phenomenon of globalization, the shock wave\r\nof conflict is often felt very far from the epicentre. It is\r\nequally clear that development cannot be ensured in an\r\nunstable environment, for peace constitutes the fertile\r\nground in which development must take root and prosper.\r\nIt is in that spirit that Gabon studied the remarkable\r\nreport (A/52/871) that the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, submitted to the Security Council on the causes of\r\nconflict in Africa. He very rightly noted that historical\r\nlegacies, internal and external factors, economic motives\r\nand particular situations are the source of many conflicts in\r\nAfrica. These various causes are known to us and we must\r\ncombat them.\r\nIn this respect, I would like to draw the attention of\r\nthe Assembly particularly to one of the causes of conflict\r\nthat I believe should be given our full attention because of\r\nthe many dangers it poses to the stability of our entire\r\ncontinent. Furthermore, this phenomenon is also evident in\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe. I refer to the question of\r\ntransnational populations — in other words, communities\r\ndispersed over several States as a result of various historical\r\ncircumstances. Aware of the danger in Africa, the founding\r\nfathers of the OAU, in their great wisdom, inscribed in its\r\nCharter the principle of the inviolability of frontiers\r\ninherited from colonization. To reshape States on the basis\r\nof diverse claims seemed to them to be simply risky. They\r\ntherefore chose to take charge of our history through the\r\nopenness of integration. Gabon reaffirms its support for\r\nthis approach.\r\nAll in all, the resurgence of nationalism, poor\r\nunderstanding and abuse of the rights of peoples as well\r\nas their manipulation, inevitably lead to national unrest,\r\nwith its attendant deadly difficulties. Faced with these\r\nrealities and possibilities, the Government of Gabon\r\nwould more than ever like to reaffirm its commitment to\r\ncertain principles which underlie the maintenance of\r\npeace and security, both internally and internationally.\r\nThese include respect for human rights in general and for\r\nthe rights of national minorities in particular; respect for\r\ncultural identities; respect for the territorial integrity of\r\nStates; respect for national sovereignty; the principle of\r\nnon-interference in internal affairs; the principle of good\r\nneighbourliness; and the principle of the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\nIn any event, dialogue remains the best and most\r\neffective way of preventing conflicts and maintaining or\r\nrestoring peace. Political differences must have a political\r\nresponse. The African populations, already overwhelmed\r\nby underdevelopment, cannot and should not have to\r\nendure, in addition, the deadly consequences of conflict.\r\nWe must therefore always engage in dialogue. This is\r\nwhy President Bongo, sensing the changes in history and\r\nthe aspirations of his people, set in motion in mid-1989\r\nthe rethinking within the former single party in our\r\ncountry that led to the national conference of March-April\r\n1990, which reopened the way to pluralism and\r\ndemocracy.\r\nNew regulatory and control institutions have\r\ngradually been established since then and they are\r\nworking. Individual and collective freedoms are\r\nrecognized and enjoyed by our citizens, who can even\r\nappeal as high as the Constitutional Court, as a glance at\r\nour newspapers in Gabon suffices to make clear. This\r\nshows how deeply committed we are to the principles of\r\nparticipatory democracy, taking into account our overall\r\nlevel of development and our sociological environment.\r\nIt is also in this new context that in two months we\r\nshall be organizing presidential elections for the second\r\ntime. The logistical and legislative preparations are\r\nalready at a very advanced stage; they are basically the\r\nwork of government. The National Electoral Commission,\r\nwhich is already in place, will conduct the actual electoral\r\noperations. Its representatives were appointed last week in\r\nall departments and communes. The Prime Minister sent\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\ninvitations a month ago to various States and organizations,\r\nincluding the United Nations, to observe both the\r\npreparations and the polling process itself.\r\nA few days ago I had the opportunity to address the\r\nSecurity Council on mechanisms for conflict prevention in\r\nour subregion. Without repeating the report that has been\r\nmade to the Assembly, I would like to recall here that, in\r\naccordance with the decision made by the heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the countries of Central Africa, Defence and\r\nInterior Ministers of the countries members of the United\r\nNations Standing Advisory Committee on Security\r\nQuestions in Central Africa, meeting in Libreville from 28\r\nto 30 April 1998, re-examined the plan for the\r\nestablishment of an early-warning mechanism as an\r\ninstrument for the prevention of crises and conflicts. Gabon,\r\nwhich now holds the chairmanship of the Committee, is\r\ndoing everything in its power to meet the logistics needs to\r\nallow Libreville to be the headquarters of that mechanism.\r\nAlong the same lines, also concerning the logic of\r\nprevention, the Committee held from 18 to 21 May 1998 in\r\nBata, Equatorial Guinea, the first conference on the\r\nquestion of relationships between democratic institutions\r\nand peace in Central Africa. That conference brought\r\ntogether members of Governments, representatives of\r\nopposition political parties, high-ranking officials of the\r\nforces of law and order, representatives of civil society and\r\nexperts on matters of political freedoms, the press and\r\nhuman rights. The participants’ main recommendation was\r\nthe establishment of a subregional parliament of Central\r\nAfrica, which would be charged with dealing with questions\r\nof common interest, with a view to strengthening measures\r\nfor confidence-building and subregional peace, while\r\nserving as a forum for harmonization of views and the\r\npromotion of values related to the democratic experiences\r\nof member States. In general, we can say that the action of\r\nthe Committee is a needed extension of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity’s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution.\r\nAll these preventive measures would be in vain if the\r\ninternational community made no further disarmament\r\nefforts. My country supports the high priority given by the\r\nUnited Nations to the question of disarmament in general\r\nand to the elimination of nuclear weapons and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction in particular. Even if the harm\r\nthey can cause is less, we are also concerned about the\r\nproliferation of conventional weapons, which are also tools\r\nof death and destruction. We therefore commend the\r\nstatement by the President of the Security Council on the\r\noccasion of the ministerial meeting on Africa held on 24\r\nSeptember 1998, in which the Council asked the ad hoc\r\nWorking Group to elaborate further concrete\r\nrecommendations on the need to stem illicit arms flows to\r\nand in Africa.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nApart from these concerns, we have certain grounds\r\nfor satisfaction. Disarmament took a step forward very\r\nrecently with the adoption of the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, which I personally signed on behalf of\r\nGabon on 4 December 1997 in Ottawa, and which has\r\njust entered into force with the deposit of the fortieth\r\ninstrument of ratification by an African country, Burkina\r\nFaso.\r\nOther significant instruments, such as the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention and the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty, have become a reality. Gabon,\r\nconvinced of the prominent role of disarmament in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, is a\r\nsignatory of these important instruments. My country\r\ninvites all States Members of the United Nations to work\r\ntowards complete and general disarmament in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, the guarantor of a lasting peace. We must\r\nmake the quest for peace a cardinal point of reference.\r\nHowever, that peace will remain in jeopardy as long\r\nas the basic needs of peoples are not met. The persistence\r\nof conflicts, non-respect for the human person, hatred and\r\nthe rejection of democratic values all have serious\r\nrepercussions on the economic health of States. Likewise,\r\nthe phenomenon of refugees and displaced persons,\r\nepidemics and the cost of reconstruction in the wake of\r\nwar all are burdens that affect already fragile economies\r\nand aggravate difficult social situations.\r\nThe situation at this end of century makes it\r\nimperative for the international community to deal with\r\ndevelopment and social issues if we wish to prevent our\r\nworld from self-destructing. The content of the 1998\r\nHuman Development Report, published by the United\r\nNations Development Programme a few weeks ago,\r\nstrengthens this conviction. The conclusions of the 1995\r\nCopenhagen summit therefore remain valid, and the\r\nUnited Nations must again take the initiative.\r\nStatements of intention no longer suffice. We need\r\nconcrete action and realistic programmes that take into\r\naccount the phenomenon of globalization. These\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nprogrammes must ensure that no one is excluded and that\r\neach of our nations, by making the necessary efforts to\r\nadapt, can become integrated in the most harmonious way\r\npossible. That is why Gabon believes it necessary to\r\nrelaunch the idea of a new partnership based on fairness in\r\norder to respond to the legitimate aspirations of people —\r\nmainly, to eliminate poverty and to promote well-being.\r\nWith globalization, States’ autonomy and room for\r\nmanoeuvre has been greatly reduced. The power of\r\nGovernments is offset by the power of the markets.\r\nOpenness and freedom, however, must not come to mean\r\nfree rein to establish the law of the jungle, in which we, the\r\nsmall and the weak, will inevitably be crushed and\r\ndestroyed.\r\nIn this context, it seemed necessary to the Government\r\nof Gabon not to abdicate but to refocus the role of the\r\nState. A new direction has been reflected, inter alia,\r\nthrough an ambitious programme of liberalization of\r\neconomic activities on the one hand and on the other by the\r\nprivatization of large sectoral public enterprises.\r\nAs for the structure of the economy of Gabon, let me\r\nsay that our country remains dependent on the sale of three\r\nprincipal raw materials: oil, wood and manganese. The\r\nprices of these products have been on the decline for\r\nseveral months now. If we factor in the fluctuations in the\r\nUnited States dollar, which is also on the decline, we can\r\nsee that the result is a decrease in the income of the State,\r\nwhich puts the country’s investment and development\r\ncapacities in considerable jeopardy.\r\nThis fact is not the only handicap to my country’s\r\ndevelopment. The debt and its servicing absorb almost 45\r\nper cent of our budgetary resources. This is truly\r\nintolerable.\r\nAll of this notwithstanding, the international financial\r\ninstitutions continue to classify Gabon as an upper middle-\r\nincome country, thus preventing its access to financing on\r\nflexible terms. Gabon is the only sub-Saharan African\r\ncountry in this situation, which is simply unjust.\r\nGabon, a developing country just like any other, asks\r\nthat international financial institutions apply new assessment\r\ncriteria and, above all, that they give more appropriate\r\nconsideration to our debt burden in order further to unleash\r\nour productive capabilities. This would benefit not only the\r\npeople of Gabon but also our partners abroad.\r\nOther major problems must also mobilize the\r\ninternational community, inter alia, the drug problem,\r\nterrorism, major pandemics, human rights and the\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe General Assembly held its twentieth special\r\nsession on the fight against drugs last June. Gabon is\r\npleased that on that occasion our Organization enshrined\r\nthe criminal nature of the traffic in drugs and broadened\r\nthe options for solutions to this scourge at the global\r\nlevel. That session gave political impetus to the\r\ninternational efforts of States in the fight against drug\r\ntrafficking, which now spares no country. The\r\nGovernment of Gabon invites the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies to further support the efforts made in\r\nthis respect at the regional level.\r\nAs for the scourge of terrorism, and bearing in mind\r\nthe horrible attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, I must\r\nfirst of all pay a tribute of compassion and respect to the\r\nmemory of the Kenyan, Tanzanian and American citizens\r\nwho lost their lives there. I express my deepest sympathy\r\nto all of those persons who were wounded. Above all, the\r\nGovernment of Gabon most forcefully reaffirms its\r\ncondemnation of acts of terrorism in all their\r\nmanifestations, wherever they may occur. We believe that\r\nno cause can justify resorting to such acts. But I also\r\ndenounce certain retaliatory measures that they inspire, in\r\nparticular the placing of countries that are suspected of\r\ninvolvement under embargo. This type of response is\r\nneither appropriate nor efficient. In most cases, those\r\ntypes of measures affect mainly innocent civilian\r\npopulations.\r\nWe believe, therefore, that under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, urgent dialogue must be undertaken to\r\nexplore ways and means of preventing and combating\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn the field of human rights, Gabon welcomes the\r\ncreation of an International Criminal Court, as established\r\nby the Statute adopted at Rome on 17 July last. The same\r\napplies to the Organization of African Unity Protocol,\r\nwhich created, at the organization’s thirty-fourth summit,\r\na Pan-African Court of Justice.\r\nBecause of industrial development, environmental\r\nquestions have become an increasingly pressing concern\r\nfor the international community. The awareness to which\r\nthe Rio Summit gave rise unfortunately was not followed\r\nup by the concrete measures that were expected.\r\nCommitments have not been fulfilled, and as time goes\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nby, the Rio consensus must lead us more than ever towards\r\na necessary commitment if we wish to avoid its remaining\r\na dead letter.\r\nI should like also to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy delegation’s satisfaction with, and its support for, the\r\nefforts made by the International Seabed Authority, the\r\nguarantor of a common heritage of humankind, in the\r\nconsideration of a draft code on the mining, exploration and\r\nexploitation of the seabed.\r\nWe must make sincere and tireless efforts on all of\r\nthese major issues. I very much appreciate the work of our\r\nOrganization, which, through its executing bodies, its\r\nspecialized agencies and with the support of other\r\norganizations, is making every effort to achieve these noble\r\nobjectives.\r\nAs I already said last year, Gabon supports the idea\r\nthat the United Nations system needs rational and consistent\r\nrenewal, in keeping with today’s realities. The proposals of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the reform of the budgetary,\r\nadministrative, social and economic sectors reflect a spirit\r\nof innovation that will make it possible to face the\r\nchallenges of the new millennium.\r\nMore specifically, as regards the thorny question of\r\nthe expansion of the Security Council, Gabon is, of course,\r\nin favour of it. We believe Africa should have two\r\npermanent seats — I repeat, two permanent seats — which\r\nwould be occupied on a rotational basis by all African\r\ncountries — I repeat, all African countries — in accordance\r\nwith modalities to be determined by them.\r\nBefore concluding, allow me to commend the\r\nachievements of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We know\r\nhis task is immense and difficult. He has already\r\naccomplished a great deal, with courage and skill. I have\r\nalready mentioned the promising views he shared with the\r\nSecurity Council on the eradication of conflicts and the\r\npromotion of lasting peace in Africa. For Africa, and for\r\nthe entire international community, we must encourage and\r\nsupport him.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this\r\nmeeting.\r\nAgenda item 20\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations,\r\nincluding special economic assistance\r\n(b) Special economic assistance to individual\r\ncountries or regions\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.1)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to the representative of Indonesia to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.1.\r\nMr. Hidayat (Indonesia): Before I introduce this\r\ndraft resolution, I would like to make a small correction\r\nto the text. The draft resolution is submitted by Indonesia\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nIt is a matter of great honour for my delegation to\r\nintroduce, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the\r\ndraft resolution contained in the document A/53/L.1,\r\nentitled “Assistance to Bangladesh in the wake of the\r\ndevastating floods”, under agenda item 20 (b), entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including\r\nspecial economic assistance: Special economic assistance\r\nto individual countries or regions”.\r\nIt is with a heavy conscience that I introduce this\r\ndraft resolution on the alarming conditions in the wake of\r\none of the most disastrous floods to hit the people of\r\nBangladesh in recent memory. The magnitude of the\r\nwidespread destruction and the toll in human life has not\r\nonly made this natural disaster a major calamity, it has far\r\nexceeded the capacity and resources of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Bangladesh to cope with it.\r\nIn this context, we are certainly encouraged by the\r\nresilience and courage of the people and the Government\r\nof Bangladesh in their effort to alleviate the suffering of\r\ndisaster victims and to put the country back on the road\r\nto development. At the same time, however, we\r\nacknowledge that there are limitations to the\r\nGovernment’s ability to overcome these difficulties which\r\nconstitute a development problem of great magnitude. It\r\nis therefore imperative that the international community\r\ndemonstrate its solidarity in mobilizing resources — both\r\nfinancial and technical assistance — to support the effort\r\nalready undertaken by the people and the Government of\r\nBangladesh.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nWe need also to ensure that the assistance mobilized\r\nwill not only alleviate the present suffering but also go a\r\nlong way on the path towards reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment. Therefore, the Group of 77 and China\r\nseriously appeal to all Member States to support this draft\r\nresolution at this hour of the Bangladeshi people’s greatest\r\nneed.\r\nBefore concluding, I have the pleasure to announce\r\nthat a number of countries have expressed their desire to\r\nsponsor the draft resolution. In addition to the countries of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China, these countries are Australia,\r\nAustria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,\r\nGermany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,\r\nLuxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\r\nPortugal, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland and the United States of America.\r\nMr. Manz (Austria): Very briefly, allow me, on\r\nbehalf of the European Union, to express our deep\r\nsympathy and concern regarding the loss of life and the\r\nunprecedented destruction of property and infrastructure\r\ncaused by the worst ever floods in Bangladesh. The\r\nEuropean Union is aware that this disaster constitutes a\r\nmajor challenge for the development of the country, calling\r\nfor national and international financial and technical\r\nassistance. The European Community and its member States\r\nhave contributed generously to assist in the immediate relief\r\nand rehabilitation efforts. For this reason, the member\r\nStates of the European Union have co-sponsored this draft\r\nresolution.\r\nMr. Kamitani (Japan): On behalf of the delegation of\r\nJapan, I would like to salute the draft resolution about to be\r\nadopted by the General Assembly entitled “Assistance to\r\nBangladesh in the wake of the devastating floods”.\r\nJapan is greatly concerned about the extensive damage\r\ncaused by the floods that have stuck Bangladesh one after\r\nthe other since mid-July, rendering 52 of the country’s 64\r\ndistricts a disaster area.\r\nAt the end of August, the Government of Japan\r\ndonated emergency humanitarian assistance, such as\r\nmedicine, medical equipment, water-purifying tablets and\r\nplastic sheets, valued at about 30 million yen, to the\r\nGovernment of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.\r\nToday, 1 October, my Government decided to dispatch a\r\nJapan disaster-relief team of experts to Bangladesh and to\r\ndonate related emergency material assistance, such as\r\nmedicine and water-purifying tablets, again worth a total of\r\nabout 30 million yen. Furthermore, on 2 October, in view\r\nof the extent of the damage, the Government of Japan is\r\nscheduled to announce that it will provide the\r\nGovernment of Bangladesh with $400,000 in emergency\r\nassistance on humanitarian grounds.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.1, entitled “Assistance to Bangladesh in the wake\r\nof the devastating floods”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.1 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/1).\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Bangladesh.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): I would like to\r\nexpress, on behalf of the Government of Bangladesh, our\r\ngratitude for the adoption by consensus at this plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly resolution 53/1, entitled\r\n“Assistance to Bangladesh in the wake of the devastating\r\nfloods”. Coincidentally, this is the first resolution to be\r\nadopted by the fifty-third session.\r\nThe magnitude of the floods this year was\r\nunprecedented. It overwhelmed our normal ability and\r\npreparation for adequate response. Quick mobilization of\r\nassistance in support of the efforts of the Bangladesh\r\nGovernment by all Member States, the United Nations\r\nsystem, multilateral and regional financial institutions and\r\nnon-governmental organizations necessitated that we\r\nadopt a resolution at this session of the General Assembly\r\nwith such urgency.\r\nThe resolution just adopted will have the effect of\r\nharmonizing the ongoing efforts of different entities that\r\nstepped forward to extend assistance to Bangladesh. The\r\nresolution expresses solidarity with the Government and\r\nthe people of Bangladesh and appeals to all Member\r\nStates and the United Nations system to respond urgently\r\nto assist Bangladesh in its efforts to overcome the\r\ndamages caused by the floods.\r\nThe General Assembly expresses its appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for the steps he took to mobilize\r\nhumanitarian assistance and requests the United Nations\r\nsystem to take all necessary measures to support\r\nBangladesh and to strengthen its capacity for seeking a\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 1 October 1998\r\nlong-term solution to problems caused by floods and natural\r\ndisasters.\r\nThe Government of Bangladesh conveys its deep\r\nappreciation to Indonesia, which submitted and introduced\r\nthe draft resolution on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, as its Chairman. I would also like to sincerely\r\nthank all the delegations that have spontaneously come\r\nforward to support and sponsor the resolution on very\r\nshort notice.\r\nA General Assembly resolution is the expression of\r\nopinion of the entire world. Through the adoption of\r\ntoday’s resolution, the entire United Nations membership\r\nand the international community have expressed solidarity\r\nwith the Government and the people of Bangladesh.\r\nThe country is now effectively engaged in relief,\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction activities under the\r\ndynamic and compassionate leadership of Prime Minister\r\nSheikh Hasina.\r\nI wish to thank all Member States again for standing\r\nby our side in Bangladesh’s hour of need.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 20.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\r\n31\r\n"
