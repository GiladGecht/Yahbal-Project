(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jamil Mahuad Witt, Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the Constitutional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador.\r\nMr. Jamil Mahuad Witt, Constitutional President of\r\nthe Republic of Ecuador, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the Constitutional President\r\nof the Republic of Ecuador, His Excellency Mr. Jamil\r\nMahuad Witt, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mahuad Witt (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): When I assumed the presidency of my country\r\nless than two months ago, I recalled that in the tradition of\r\nthe Aymara, an indigenous people of the Republic of\r\nBolivia, a human being and a country — and, may I say,\r\nthe United Nations — do their work if they manage to find\r\nharmony in seven fundamental fields.\r\nFor the Aymaras there is a type of harmony that rises\r\nfrom the head, and that is the harmony we need to maintain\r\nwith our beliefs and principles.\r\nThere is a second type of harmony which goes from\r\nthe feet down. That is the harmony we must maintain\r\nwith nature, the Earth and the environment.\r\nThere is a third harmony that goes from the body\r\nout to the right side. That is the harmony we must have\r\nwith our families, with those closest to us.\r\nA fourth type of harmony moves towards the left.\r\nThat is the harmony we must have with our neighbours,\r\nour colleagues at work and those others who, without\r\nbeing very close to us, surround us.\r\nThere is a fifth type of harmony which moves\r\nforward from us, and for the Aymara people that is\r\nharmony with the past. They believe that human beings\r\nface the past and not the future, because we can see what\r\nis in front of us, and the past is the only thing we can\r\nreally see.\r\nA sixth type of harmony is behind us. That is our\r\nharmony with the future, because although we do not see\r\nthe future we have an intuition about it and a sense of it.\r\nOften, although it has not yet come, we can already feel\r\nits weight on our shoulders.\r\nThe seventh and final type of harmony is self-\r\nharmony, an inner harmony.\r\nIf we achieve harmony in those seven areas, we will\r\nhave a harmonious body, a harmonious country and a\r\nharmonious world. It is with that vision that we have\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nbegun to govern in Ecuador; and I believe it is with that\r\nvision that the United Nations is doing its work.\r\nWe can discuss many issues here. I want to focus on\r\ntwo, both related to left-sided harmony — harmony with\r\nour neighbours, international harmony — and their\r\nimplications for the development of our peoples.\r\nIn Latin America, as in many parts of the world, we\r\nface one of the gravest crises in our history. We have been\r\nconsidering the advantages of globalization. Now we are\r\nalso suffering the problems of globalization. When we\r\nspeak of a global system, we speak of a real network,\r\nwhich, like a large cobweb, encompasses us all. The\r\nproblem with such a network is that wherever we touch or\r\napply pressure to the web we produce a vibration and an\r\nimpact throughout the web.\r\nThe great majority of the countries of Latin America\r\nhave made enormous efforts to overcome the problems of\r\nprevious decades. They have worked to reduce their fiscal\r\ndeficits to a minimum, to open up to the global economy,\r\nto participate in trade and to share the principles of open,\r\nfair and transparent trade, free of discrimination. They have\r\nunderstood that integration is the tool for progress in the\r\nfuture. They have established regional markets, and now\r\nthey seek a continental market. After so much effort, which\r\nat times has been costly in internal terms, we have found\r\nthat that effort can be wasted, that it may not be a way out\r\nof our problems, because of an international crisis, which\r\ndid not originate in our countries; it came from outside, but\r\nbecause of globalization, and the network connecting us, we\r\nare all affected.\r\nWe understand the mechanics of the system. We\r\nunderstand how something that affects markets in Asia has\r\nan impact on Latin America. Yet, while we understand the\r\nmechanics of the system, we cannot see its fairness. If\r\nwhile working together we encounter problems that do not\r\noriginate in our region, we must ask the industrialized\r\ncountries in particular to take decisions that will ensure that\r\nnot all the countries of the world suffer to the extent that\r\nwe are suffering now.\r\nThere is talk of risk of a global recession as severe as,\r\nor even more severe, than that of the 1930s. We see the\r\nstock markets of the largest countries of our region affected\r\ndaily. We see a crisis that is already striking the\r\nindustrialized countries. I think this is the appropriate forum\r\nfor us to consider the need to work together. We small\r\ncountries like Ecuador can do little in a crisis of this\r\nmagnitude but call for reflection and true fraternity among\r\nour nations so that a problem affecting the whole world\r\ncan be overcome. Otherwise, a crisis as big as this leaves\r\nmany of us with no option but to wait and see how we\r\ncan protect ourselves against these troubles.\r\nThe countries of Latin America see ourselves as a\r\nregion, and we believe we must behave as a region. Every\r\ncountry has its own characteristics and has to do what is\r\nnecessary individually, but it is the region as a whole that\r\nis being affected by all these changes.\r\nThe countries of Latin America have not come here\r\nsimply to ask for money and loans, as they have done at\r\nother times of crisis. The countries of the region have not\r\nappeared here one by one to try to overcome their\r\ndifficulties on an individual basis, as on other occasions.\r\nThis time we have made joint proposals — just, global\r\nproposals. We hope these proposals will yield results.\r\nAll analysts maintain that unless interest rates are\r\nlowered, in particular in the industrialized countries, this\r\nglobal trend is undoubtedly not going to change. The 0.25\r\nper cent drop in interest rates was widely considered\r\nimportant but insufficient in view of the magnitude of the\r\ncurrent crisis. It is therefore crucial that we deal with this\r\nmatter here in the Assembly.\r\nAlong with this international crisis, Ecuador is\r\nconfronting an issue that is fundamental to its\r\ndevelopment: its relations with Peru, and the search for a\r\ndefinitive peace with Peru. We have a problem that has\r\nbeen dragged out over many decades. In its most recent\r\nstage, for the last 56 years, we have had a protocol of\r\npeace, friendship and boundaries, which should now enter\r\na definitive phase. Peace is our objective; we see it as an\r\nethical, moral and economic good. Nothing is more\r\nadvantageous to the budgets of our countries than peace.\r\nWe can do great things for the benefit of our economies.\r\nIn this case, peace is accompanied by a set of\r\nincentives, specifically, the possibility of $3 billion in\r\nloans from multilateral entities for border development\r\nprojects, irrigation, roads, agricultural systems, schools\r\nand health centres, to give a few examples. This $3\r\nbillion — a very large sum for both countries — can be\r\nput into action if we achieve peace.\r\nOver the past three years, we have been holding\r\ntalks. Commissions have reached agreements on border\r\nintegration, trade, navigation in the extraordinarily\r\nimportant basin of the Amazon river and measures of\r\nsecurity and confidence-building for the future. But the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nmost delicate and difficult issue has yet to be resolved: the\r\nestablishment of the borderline between the two countries.\r\nWe have held talks at a number of levels — among our\r\nForeign Ministers, in the negotiating commissions, among\r\nthe countries that are guarantors of the protocol — and\r\nthese conversations have also risen to the level of the\r\npresidencies of Peru and Ecuador. We have had three\r\nmeetings in less than two months in order to seek that final\r\nagreement. Last night, I spoke with President Fujimori; he\r\nis planning to travel to the United States, and we agreed\r\nthat tomorrow we will see each other here in New York for\r\na fourth meeting to try to continue seeking the definitive\r\nformula that will resolve the question of our border in a\r\nway that is fitting, acceptable to the two countries and\r\nappropriate for our peoples.\r\nThe principles are clear. As countries, we cannot enter\r\nthe twenty-first century dragging with us problems that date\r\nback to the nineteenth. We must embark on the twenty-first\r\ncentury with a clear and positive vision that is directed\r\ntowards the future.\r\nWe share all the tenets of the United Nations on issues\r\nrelated to this one. We are completely in agreement with\r\nthe Ottawa Convention on the question of landmines. Our\r\ncountry signed that Convention, and at the end of last week\r\nin Brasilia, the Presidents of Peru and Ecuador submitted to\r\nPresident Cardoso of Brazil a joint communiqué requesting\r\nthat plans be drawn up for the removal of all the landmines\r\nthat have been placed in the border area over the years.\r\nThis is a positive and very real step; it means that the\r\nConvention will not simply be signed and ratified but will\r\nalso be applied in practical terms in the field.\r\nWe are also completely in agreement with the\r\nproposals of the United Nations on the reduction of military\r\nbudgets and expenditures. We believe that money should be\r\ninvested in poverty reduction and in the social programmes\r\nand projects our peoples need so much. We are completely\r\nin agreement with the conventional disarmament\r\nprogrammes. We believe that trust must replace distrust,\r\nand we believe that this task, accomplished jointly, can\r\nallow us to leave behind long decades of mutual suspicion\r\nand the great scepticism that sometimes pervades our\r\ncountries. We are in agreement as regards general and\r\ncomplete disarmament. We agree with the prohibition of\r\nnuclear weapons. We welcome the decision of the Southern\r\nCone Common Market (MERCOSUR) to make all the\r\ncountries of that region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nWe believe in peace, and we are working to achieve\r\nit. It will be hard to find, in the future, two Presidents of\r\nneighbouring countries with a history of problems who\r\nare so firmly committed to peace, so deeply convinced\r\nthat they must achieve peace, and so zealously at work to\r\nreach a speedy, just and honourable peace. We hope our\r\nefforts will soon meet their reward.\r\nWe completely support the initiatives of the United\r\nNations on the subject of the protection of human rights.\r\nEcuador has adopted its own national human rights plan\r\ninto law. We are the second country in Latin America,\r\nand one of the first in the world, to adopt such a plan. It\r\nis not a plan of the Ecuadorian Government, but a plan\r\nmade by Ecuadorian society, coordinated by the Ministry\r\nwith the participation of representatives of various sectors\r\nof the society. We believe in human rights, and we\r\ndefend them in their entirety and without reservation. Our\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs was the first United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights before joining our\r\nMinistry for Foreign Relations, so our support in this field\r\nis complete.\r\nIn addition, we are concerned about the issue of\r\nsustainable development, and we will vigorously promote\r\nenvironmental issues. For the first time in history, a\r\nwoman from a country that is not in the northern\r\nhemisphere has become chairperson of the world’s largest\r\nintergovernmental organization on the environment. That\r\nwoman’s name is Yolanda Kakabadse, and she is the\r\npresent Minister of the Environment in Ecuador. We seek\r\nto indicate several things by this, which are easily\r\nunderstandable in what I have just said.\r\nThese are the central issues in the link between the\r\nUnited Nations and my country: peace, the international\r\ncrisis and the search for a just global accord, the\r\nenvironment and human rights. Other issues could be\r\ntaken up, but I prefer to focus on this message.\r\nI believe that there is no better way to pay tribute to\r\nthe United Nations and to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nthan for two countries with democratically elected\r\nGovernments to seek peace and endeavour to sign a peace\r\nagreement — perhaps sign one this year — so that the\r\ndevelopment of our peoples can proceed and their quality\r\nof life can improve.\r\nIn this way we can sum up the most important\r\nhuman rights. Democracy, freedom, development, life, the\r\nright to work, gender-related issues, the problems of\r\nminorities and the most disadvantaged groups and the\r\nprotection of children are encompassed in these words\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nthat are so simple and so important: peace, development\r\nand international cooperation. We want to emphasize these\r\nideas here, in this Organization which has done so much to\r\nbring them about throughout the world.\r\nI wish the Assembly every success in its work for the\r\nbenefit of all of humanity.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Ecuador for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jamil Mahuad Witt, Constitutional President of\r\nthe Republic of Ecuador, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof the Comoros, His Excellency Mr. Salim Hadji Himidi,\r\non whom I now call.\r\nMr. Himidi (Comoros) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me at the outset, Mr. President, on behalf of the\r\npeople and Government of my country, the Islamic Federal\r\nRepublic of the Comoros, to extend my sincere condolences\r\nto all the States and peoples who have suffered devastation\r\nfrom Hurricane Georges, and to the victims of the floods in\r\nthe People’s Republic of China and in Bangladesh.\r\nI am pleased to be able to join with the distinguished\r\nand worthy representatives of States and Governments who\r\nhave preceded me at this rostrum in extending to you, Sir,\r\non behalf of the President of the Islamic Federal Republic\r\nof the Comoros, His Excellency El Hadj Mohamed Taki\r\nAbdoulkarim, my warm congratulations on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nregular session.\r\nI also pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, as well as to the greatly respected\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our Organization,\r\nfor the dedication, skill and other outstanding qualities\r\nwhich they have shown in carrying out their respective functions.\r\nMy country, which is located at the north-west\r\nentrance to the Mozambique Channel, half way between the\r\nEast African coast and the large island of Madagascar,\r\nsmall, fragmented and geographically isolated though it is,\r\nwas accepted to full membership in the United Nations on\r\n12 November 1975 by resolution 3385 (XXX), as a State\r\ncomprising the islands of Anjouan, Grande-Comore —\r\nalso known as Ngazidja — Mayotte and Mohéli.\r\nWe should also note that from 1889 until the\r\nreferendum through which my country acceded to\r\nindependence, all the laws and other regulatory texts\r\napplied by the former colonial Power recognized and\r\nsanctioned the territorial unity and integrity of the\r\narchipelago of the Comoros.\r\nThus for 23 years, at each of the regular sessions of\r\nthis Assembly, successive resolutions have been adopted\r\nrecalling that the continuation of the legal, administrative\r\nand military hold of the former colonial Power over the\r\nComorian island of Mayotte is a flagrant violation of\r\nresolution 1514 (XV) and of the fundamental principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter. We therefore hope that the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Ad Hoc Committee\r\nof Seven on the Question of the Comorian Island of\r\nMayotte, presided over by His Excellency Mr. Omar\r\nBongo, President of the Republic of Gabon, will resume\r\nits work and re-establish the dialogue between the\r\nComoros and France on this question.\r\nFinally, we appeal to the wisdom and goodwill\r\nbeyond our continent, so that the Comoros can return\r\nonce and for all to the path of peace, security and hope.\r\nI should like solemnly to appeal to this Assembly for\r\nassistance to my country so that a solution to the problem\r\ncaused by its dismemberment can be found and my\r\ncountry can enter the twenty-first century as a reunited\r\ncountry.\r\nThe people, Government and head of State whom I\r\nam honoured and privileged to represent here today would\r\nlike to express, through my delegation, their gratitude and\r\nacknowledgement to the Secretary-General of our\r\nuniversal Organization for the clarity and lucidity of his\r\nanalysis of the causes of conflict on the African continent\r\nand for his courageous initiatives in the search for peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa and throughout the\r\nworld. In this context, we urge the United Nations system\r\nand its specialized agencies to do all in their power to\r\nensure the rapid and complete implementation of all of\r\nthe recommendations provided by the Secretary-General\r\nin his report to the Security Council which he presented\r\nlast April.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nMy Government urgently appeals to the international\r\ncommunity for cooperation to effectively combat terrorism\r\nin all its forms. Only international determination, with\r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, will\r\nmake it possible to put an end to horrendous terrorist acts.\r\nTerrorism spares no part of the world and no stratum of\r\nsociety. Who can forget the murderous acts committed this\r\nsummer in Omagh, Ireland; Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam;\r\nCape Town, South Africa; and Luxor, Egypt? For our part,\r\nmy Government is cooperating openly and fully with the\r\nAmerican authorities to shed light on the suspected\r\nparticipation of a national of my country in the abhorrent\r\ncrimes committed in East Africa.\r\nSince my country is a telling example of the hotbeds\r\nof tension which are now mobilizing the resources of the\r\ninternational community, I should like to recall that for a\r\nyear and a half now the Organization of African Unity has\r\ntaken up — in close cooperation with the League of Arab\r\nStates, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and,\r\nvery recently, the Non-Aligned Movement — the separatist\r\ncrisis on the Comorian island of Anjouan and the links to\r\nbe established with the dismemberment of our archipelago\r\nState by the island of Mayotte’s continuing to be under\r\nforeign administration.\r\nThe efforts and commitments of the Secretary-General\r\nof the OAU, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, and his Special\r\nEnvoys, Ambassador Pierre Yéré and Mr. Mamoudou Kane,\r\nsince the beginning of the crisis, as well as the efforts of\r\nthe Governments involved in regional coordination to\r\nresolve the crisis in the Comoros, namely, Kenya, Tanzania,\r\nMozambique, South Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius and the\r\nSeychelles, have been recognized and deserve admiration\r\nand support.\r\nMy country’s people, Government and head of State\r\nwould like to convey through my delegation to the entire\r\ninternational community their commitment to peace and\r\nunity and reconciliation between the community of islands\r\nwhich make up the nation of the Comoros.\r\nSpecial mention should be made here of the most\r\nrespected statesman of our world, President Nelson\r\nMandela, who, in his dual capacity as head of State\r\nentrusted with regional coordination to resolve the crisis in\r\nthe Comoros, mandated by the OAU, and Chairman of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, has agreed to bring to bear his full\r\nauthority and his personal prestige throughout the world to\r\ncall upon the parties in conflict in the Comoros to conclude\r\na peace of the brave, in which there is neither victor nor\r\nvanquished, peace brought about for the greatest possible\r\nbenefit of the inhabitants of our archipelago State.\r\nIn the light of the claims and the rights\r\nacknowledged by our institutions, traditions, conventions\r\nand customs in a multi-island society, El Hadj Mohamed\r\nTaki Abdoulkarim, President of the Islamic Federal\r\nRepublic of the Comoros, declared after the OAU summit\r\nin Ouagadougo, and again recently in Durban during the\r\nNAM summit, that he was ready to work in a spirit of\r\nopenness and reconciliation for greater decentralization\r\nand autonomy for each of the four islands making up our\r\narchipelago State. Thus each of our islands will be able\r\nto elect a governor and a local legislative assembly to\r\ndeal with all matters relating to the immediate and\r\nparticular concerns of each of our communities of the\r\nislands of the archipelago State. An inter-island\r\ncommission will work for the equitable and proportional\r\ndistribution of the international community’s resources\r\nand investments.\r\nHere I quote what El Hadj Mohamed Taki\r\nAbdoulkarim has rightly said, as follows:\r\n“This is an issue of bringing the administration\r\ncloser to its subjects, promoting the responsibility\r\nwithin a single citizenry and restoring the federal\r\nbodies of a united State their fundamental roles of\r\norganization, arbitration and the management of\r\ninternational sovereignty.\r\n“The future of our country will only be ensured\r\nwhen all opinions and all trends, in an atmosphere\r\nof greater tolerance, are accepted and fulfilled.”\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\n“Thus have We made of you\r\nAn Unmat justly balanced.\r\nThat ye might be witnesses\r\nOver the nations,\r\nAnd the Messenger a witness\r\nOver yourselves”. (The Holy Koran, II:143)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Paskal Milo, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Albania, on whom I now call.\r\nMr. Milo (Albania): Allow me first, Sir, to\r\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am sure that\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nyour leadership constitutes a guarantee of continued\r\nsuccess.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to express my\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, for his\r\nexcellent leadership during the fifty-second session.\r\nMr. Al-Ashtal (Yemen), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIt is a special pleasure for me to address the Assembly\r\nin this session, which coincides with the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the Universal Declaration of the Human Rights.\r\nAlthough decades have passed, this document remains\r\nprofoundly relevant to our world today. In fact, its\r\nstandards continue to be an essential guide for evaluating\r\nthe development and emancipation of human society. The\r\nMember countries of the United Nations should be proud of\r\nthis document’s lasting legacy.\r\nWhile affirming the ongoing importance of the\r\nDeclaration, I would like to stress the need for the UN’s\r\nsystem of values to undergo an ongoing harmonization with\r\nnew challenges. In this framework, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Albania, I commend the efforts made under\r\nthe leadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in\r\nthe process of reform of our Organization. We hail the\r\npositive results achieved so far, and encourage the United\r\nNations to continue to respond concretely to the challenges\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nNearly three weeks ago Albania once again attracted\r\nthe attention of the United Nations due to the violent events\r\naimed at striking a blow against the fragile democratic\r\ninstitutions that were under the process of restoration from\r\nthe deep crisis my country passed through last year. Certain\r\npolitical forces that lost their power in last year’s free\r\nelections obviously encouraged the attack and occupation of\r\nthe main State institutions.\r\nThat attempt to overthrow violently the legitimate\r\nAlbanian Government was condemned by the whole\r\ndemocratic world, which strongly supported the President\r\nof the Republic in his endeavour to reestablish the political\r\nequilibrium that had been deeply disturbed and to guarantee\r\nthe normal and democratic functioning of State powers and\r\ninstitutions. We highly appreciate this, and thank the\r\ninternational community for the support offered to Albania\r\nduring its difficult days, and we welcome the establishment\r\nof the group of Friends of Albania. We view this as an\r\nimportant instrument in our common efforts for the stability\r\nof Albania and the consolidation of State structures and\r\ninstitutions.\r\nWe are conscious of the difficulties and negative\r\nphenomena with which we are coping. We are painfully\r\naware that the civilian population of Albania continues to\r\nbe considered the most armed in Europe. This is a reality\r\nwhich we have to face every moment. Taking into\r\naccount the threat that this poses not only to Albania but\r\nalso to the security of the region, our Government has\r\nappealed the United Nations for assistance in this regard.\r\nAllow me on this occasion to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor the seriousness with which he has dealt with this\r\nproblem, and the Under-Secretary-General for\r\nDisarmament Affairs, Mr. Dhanapala, for the mission he\r\nled to Albania. I want to express our readiness to work\r\ntogether with the United Nations to collect the weapons\r\nwhich fell into the hands of the civilian population during\r\nthe political unrest of 1997.\r\nI want to state that my Government is working\r\ndiligently to establish the long-term rule of law in our\r\ncountry. Through lengthy deliberations among Albania’s\r\npolitical forces, we have made an extensive endeavour to\r\ndraft a constitution that recognizes the need to share\r\npolitical power and to secure human rights. It is my\r\nsincere hope that by the end of this year the Albanian\r\npeople will be able to express their views on the proposed\r\ndraft constitution. The adoption of a constitution ratified\r\nby the people of Albania that recognizes the fundamental\r\nrule of law and protects liberties will prepare Albania for\r\ncomplete integration into international structures. Most\r\nimportant, this path offers the best and brightest hope for\r\nour country.\r\nI want also to address Albania’s economic situation.\r\nRebuilding the economy has been the highest of priorities\r\nfor the Albanian Government, especially since the fall of\r\nthe pyramid schemes which led to widespread micro- and\r\nmacroeconomic collapse and to the impoverishment of\r\nmany Albanians. Our response to this crisis was direct\r\nand decisive: in exposing the deceit of the pyramid\r\nschemes, in closing down the pyramid structures and in\r\nrebuilding trust in the Albanian economy. In cooperation\r\nwith the International Monetary Fund and the World\r\nBank, the assets of those firms were audited, and we\r\ninitiated the process of returning liquid assets to\r\nlegitimate creditors. Now I can declare with conviction\r\nthat pyramid-scheme-based businesses do not exist in our\r\ncountry any more. We are working at present to create\r\nnew, active policies for employment, self-employment and\r\nprofessional training.\r\nThe task of rebuilding Albania’s economy constitutes\r\na great challenge that requires the support of the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\ninternational community. The Government has worked\r\ndiligently to break down Albania’s decades of isolationism\r\nand to become part of the world community of nations. The\r\nmain directions of our policy so far have been the\r\nfollowing.\r\nFirst, the engagement of Albania in Euro-Atlantic\r\nintegration is aimed at the creation of acceptable national\r\nstandards in accordance with the common Euro-Atlantic\r\nvalues of common security, human rights standards, and the\r\npromotion of the liberal market-economy policies.\r\nSecondly, Albania’s cooperation with the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has also had concrete\r\nresults, expressed in successful cooperation, in the\r\nframework of the Partnership for Peace, on the qualification\r\nof the Albanian army and police. The first Albanian\r\ncompany of peacekeepers has in fact made tangible\r\nprogress in that direction.\r\nAnd thirdly, our cooperation with the European Union,\r\nthe Council of Europe and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe has been further strengthened.\r\nIt includes their assistance not only in the shaping and\r\nimprovement of Albanian legislation, but also in monitoring\r\nthe application of common standards. I take this opportunity\r\nto thank those institutions for their assistance and to express\r\nonce again the willingness and the political commitment of\r\nour Government to raise the quality of this cooperation in\r\nthe future.\r\nAlbania’s cooperation with the European Union in the\r\neconomic area remains a basis for multilateral cooperation.\r\nWe consider membership in the World Trade Organization\r\nto be vital in furthering the liberalization of Albanian\r\ntrading markets. In the meantime, we have strengthened our\r\nrelations with international financial institutions, which have\r\ncommitted major financial resources to the economic\r\ndevelopment of Albania.\r\nOn this occasion, please allow me to express my\r\ngratitude for the approval of the first United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme country cooperation framework\r\nfor Albania, and my desire for the further strengthening of\r\ncooperation between Albania and the United Nations\r\nsystem. Albania now has serious and powerful partners for\r\nthe development of our country. The Rome and Brussels\r\nconferences will be followed by another follow-up\r\nconference in Tirana, at which we will assess our progress\r\nand make new commitments for the future.\r\nTurning to matters of international policy, the\r\nAlbanian Government has devoted much effort to regional\r\nconcerns. Southeastern Europe has inherited a series of\r\nproblems which are the political, economic, social,\r\npsychological and institutional legacy of the communist\r\nera. However, we are deeply convinced that there are\r\nways and means to build up confidence, cooperation and\r\nfriendship among the Balkan nations. Albania has\r\nembraced enthusiastically all the initiatives which\r\ncultivate peace and cooperation in southeastern Europe,\r\nsuch as the Central European Initiative, the Black Sea\r\nEconomic Cooperation process, the South-East European\r\nCooperative Initiative, the Royaumont Platform for Action\r\nand the process of Balkan cooperation. All these\r\ninitiatives will contribute to transparency of borders, free\r\nmovement of goods, people and opinions among the\r\ncountries of the region, and the setting up of common\r\nvalues on trade, transport, energy, telecommunication and\r\nthe environment that will lay down the infrastructure for\r\nstability and peace in the region.\r\nTowards this goal, we have worked on substantially\r\nimproving bilateral relations with our neighbours.\r\nSignificant steps were taken last year concerning relations\r\nwith Italy, Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, on which a great number of cooperative\r\nagreements were signed. Close partnership relations have\r\ndeveloped with Turkey, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania,\r\nSlovenia, et cetera.\r\nAlthough I am underlining these positive and\r\nencouraging aspects of regional cooperation in general,\r\nand especially of Albania’s relations with its neighbours,\r\nwe cannot ignore the fact that in the Balkans there still\r\nexist enclaves where fundamental human and national\r\nrights and freedoms, including the right to life, are\r\nbrutally violated every day. I am, of course, referring here\r\nto the problem of Kosovo.\r\nI would like to confirm the conviction of the\r\nAlbanian Government that during the past months of the\r\nKosovo crisis, Belgrade has ignored the appeals of the\r\ninternational community to find an appropriate solution to\r\nthat situation, and has systematically destroyed the\r\nalternative of a peaceful solution, thus encouraging the\r\noption of violence. Some days ago, the Security Council\r\nadopted its resolution 1199 (1998), attributing the main\r\nresponsibility and blame for what is happening in Kosovo\r\nto the authorities in Belgrade. That resolution testified to\r\nunanimous political will on the part of the international\r\ncommunity to act strongly to find a peaceful, political\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nsolution to the conflict, and left open the option of using\r\nother means if failure is repeated.\r\nWe hope that this time the clear warning given by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1199 (1998), the Council’s\r\nstrong message issued yesterday and the warnings given by\r\nthe NATO and world leaders, will be the last ones\r\nnecessary to impose a political solution on the authorities\r\nin Belgrade, something which they cannot realize by\r\nthemselves of their own will.\r\nThe political archives of Belgrade are quite rich with\r\nfalse manoeuvres and untrue statements. The so-called\r\nwithdrawal of special Serbian police forces from Kosovo\r\nand the end of fighting against so-called terrorists is a new\r\nversion of them. This is an old scenario of a Bosnian type,\r\nand we Albanians have ample reasons not to believe it.\r\nWhat is happening today in Kosovo is the story of a\r\ntragedy foretold. Milosević has in fact ordered the\r\nimplementation of his “ethnic cleansing” policy against\r\nAlbanians under the pretext of combating so-called\r\nAlbanian terrorism. This has so far proved to be a constant\r\nelement of his strategy. In that way, Serbian propaganda\r\nhas been trying to justify the indiscriminate attacks,\r\nmassacres and atrocities of the Yugoslav army against the\r\nAlbanian population of Kosovo, such as the ones seen\r\nlately in the media. Newborn children, pregnant women and\r\nelderly persons have been massacred in a bestial way. The\r\nAlbanian Government strongly condemns this policy and\r\nopenly declares that Milosević should be held accountable\r\nand responsible for genocide.\r\nThe Albanian Government urges the following. First,\r\nthere should be strong and extensive international\r\nmonitoring and assisting presence in Kosovo. The nature of\r\nthis presence should be in accordance with the\r\ndevelopments in the situation there. Secondly, there should\r\nbe an immediate NATO military intervention for peace\r\nenforcement in Kosovo, as peaceful measures applied by\r\nthe international community have so far failed. Thirdly, the\r\nProsecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia should start an investigation in\r\naccordance with her mandate in order to indict Milosević as\r\na war criminal.\r\nThe current conflict in Kosovo, as rightly pointed out\r\nin the resolutions and presidential statement of the Security\r\nCouncil, may have a strong spillover danger. The\r\nneighbouring countries are directly affected not only by the\r\nwave of refugees, but also by its impact on the ethnic and\r\npolitical relations inside these countries. We have already\r\nbeen witness to these effects.\r\nAlbania has made its position quite clear. We are in\r\nfavour of an immediate end to the conflict and the\r\ninitiation of negotiations between Belgrade and Priština\r\nwith the international involvement of a third party. This\r\nwould guarantee their success. The negotiations should\r\ndefine the future status of Kosovo. The Albanian\r\nGovernment strongly believes that any solution to the\r\nKosovo crisis should take into consideration and respect\r\nthe will of its inhabitants for self-determination in\r\naccordance with the relevant international conventions.\r\nHumanitarian problems have always been the focus\r\nof attention of our Organization, which has also gained\r\nvaluable experience on how to deal with them. I would\r\nlike to draw the Assembly’s attention to one the most\r\nacute developments which has already been the object of\r\nattention in United Nations bodies. Thousands of Kosovo\r\nAlbanians — women, old people and children — have\r\nleft their country and have gone as refugees to Albania,\r\nMontenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia. Hundreds of thousands of others are now\r\nhomeless, driven to wander in the forests and mountains\r\nof Kosovo, constantly facing terror and death; and it is\r\nnow almost winter.\r\nIn spite of the known difficulties, the Albanian\r\nGovernment has taken all possible measures to cope with\r\nthe difficult situation which was created as a result of the\r\ninflux of Kosovo refugees in northern Albania. Albania,\r\nin cooperation with specialized agencies, has actually\r\ncreated suitable conditions to face the urgent need for\r\nfood and temporary shelter. We appeal to these agencies\r\nto continue their assistance until this refugee crisis is\r\nresolved and Albanians can safely return to their homes.\r\nWe are convinced that the United Nations and the\r\nSecurity Council will fulfil their responsibilities in\r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter in the efforts\r\nto overcome the Kosovo crisis, which in fact has become\r\na crisis of the Balkans and Europe. It is high time the\r\nUnited Nations and other international forums urgently\r\nintervened for the restoration of peace; otherwise we risk\r\nhaving a wider conflict.\r\nOn this occasion, I would like to thank the Security\r\nCouncil once again for the adoption of resolution 1199\r\n(1998) and to commend in particular the initiators of that\r\nresolution, which constitutes an essential step in bringing\r\npeace to Kosovo and stability to the region.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nAlbania, like many other countries, is being affected\r\nby a set of phenomena such as drugs, illegal trafficking and\r\norganized crime. The Albanian Government has taken\r\ndetermined measures and is predisposed to cooperate with\r\nother countries to fight against these social scourges. We\r\nheld a special session of the General Assembly this year\r\ndevoted to the fight against drugs, as well as an open\r\ndebate in the Security Council on children in armed\r\nconflicts. These efforts testify to the special attention paid\r\nto these social problems, and our Government hails them.\r\nWe appreciate the debate held by the Security Council\r\non Africa, the System-wide Special Initiative on Africa and\r\nthe engagement of the United Nations system for peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa, a continent with incredible natural\r\nand human potentials.\r\nMy country also desires a peaceful solution to the\r\nconflict in the Middle East and the restarting of the\r\ndialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, in conformity\r\nwith the relevant international agreements and resolutions\r\nof Security Council.\r\nWe believe that the international community has often\r\nacted insufficiently in punishing the perpetrators of and the\r\npeople politically responsible for crimes against mankind.\r\nConsequently, we appreciate the efforts made by the United\r\nNations for the establishment of an International Criminal\r\nCourt, and we consider this a process of strengthening the\r\nconscience of the international community, as well as a step\r\nforward in creating a collective positive reaction against\r\nsuch crimes.\r\nThe Albanian Government is of the opinion that the\r\ninstitutional reform of the United Nations is an ongoing\r\nprocess which is affected by the ever changing real world.\r\nThe United Nations will be better able to face the new\r\nchallenges of the new millennium if the intergovernmental\r\ninstitutions of the United Nations become even more\r\ndemocratic in their structure.\r\nOne key area of such reform is the Security Council.\r\nAlbania follows attentively the proceedings of the Working\r\nGroup for the restructuring of the Security Council and the\r\nefforts made to find a solution to this question. We are of\r\nthe opinion that any decision to reform the Security Council\r\nshould have the widespread support of member countries\r\nand must take into account the new realities that are\r\noccurring in international relations.\r\nThe reform of United Nations, and especially of the\r\nSecurity Council, will be a reality only if there is a general\r\nwill to provide the United Nations with the necessary\r\npolitical support. Only then will this Organization lead\r\nour world to the common goal of the creation of a global\r\nsociety of sovereign nations based on the rule of law,\r\nrespect for human rights, personal and religious liberties,\r\neconomic prosperity and international peace.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe next speaker is the Chairman of the delegation of\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Mr. George Winston McKenzie.\r\nMr. McKenzie (Trinidad and Tobago): It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to extend to Mr. Didier Opertti warmest\r\ncongratulations on behalf of the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago on his election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly. Trinidad and Tobago is indeed heartened to\r\nsee one of its regional neighbours in this post, more so\r\ngiven the close ties of friendship which exist between\r\nTrinidad and Tobago and Uruguay. I am convinced that\r\nunder his astute guidance the deliberations of the\r\nAssembly will be managed with the same skill and\r\ndiplomacy with which he is known to discharge his duties\r\nof office.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express deep\r\nappreciation for the manner in which his predecessor, Mr.\r\nUdovenko, undertook the tasks of office during his tenure\r\nas President of the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly. The impact of his leadership and the\r\nachievements of the Assembly during the last session of\r\nthe General Assembly can only redound to the benefit of\r\nthis body.\r\nThe United Nations has grappled, over the past 53\r\nyears of its existence, with myriad issues confronting the\r\ninternational community — old issues and new issues,\r\nespecially those which have taken on a new dynamic in\r\nthe international relations of our Member States. Having\r\nsuccessfully manoeuvred through the high seas of the cold\r\nwar, the United Nations continues to confront issues of\r\ndirect concern to all its Member States. In striving to\r\nattain its goals of international peace and security and\r\njustice for all, which are the raison d’être of the United\r\nNations, this most valuable Organization to all of the\r\nworld’s peoples is now drawn to focus on development as\r\na necessary precondition to the achievement of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe are now called upon to focus attention on the\r\ndeep-seated problems of the global community. These\r\ninclude the alleviation of poverty; drug abuse and illicit\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\ndrug-trafficking; environmental degradation; economic\r\ngrowth and social development of developing countries;\r\nand; more recently, the effects of the international financial\r\ncrisis. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is of the\r\nview that these challenges can be successfully addressed\r\nonly through international cooperation. No individual state\r\nor region can in isolation rid itself of these problems.\r\nOne of the principal tenets of international peace and\r\nsecurity is the rule of international law. For too long,\r\nblatant disregard for international law has led to heinous\r\ncrimes which have shocked the conscience of mankind,\r\nmany of which have remained unpunished. Perpetrators of\r\ngenocide, of crimes against humanity and of war crimes\r\nhave acted with impunity, causing untold human suffering\r\nand loss of life on a massive scale.\r\nEach life lost, each soul affected, each family, society\r\nor country touched by tragedy is one too many. The\r\ninternational community has not, until now, established a\r\npermanent mechanism to punish the perpetrators of these\r\nunspeakable crimes.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is proud of\r\nthe role played by Mr. Arthur Robinson, President of the\r\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago, in refocusing the\r\nattention of the international community in 1989 on the\r\nneed for the establishment of a permanent International\r\nCriminal Court.\r\nWe congratulate the ever increasing number of States\r\nwhich have worked assiduously since then to ensure the\r\nestablishment of a permanent, independent and effective\r\nInternational Criminal Court. At the same time, we urge all\r\nStates to continue, in the spirit of cooperation and\r\ncompromise which ensured the success of the Rome\r\nConference in July 1998, to complete the work that still\r\nremains to be done. In this quest, we all must be ever\r\nmindful of the continued threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity as well as breaches of international justice, which\r\nare occurring even as we meet today.\r\nWhen the President of the Republic of Trinidad and\r\nTobago urged the international community to create a\r\npermanent International Criminal Court, it was in part a\r\nrecognition of the gravity of the scourge of drug trafficking\r\nand its attendant ills, and of the pressing need for the Court\r\nto address the question of the punishment of individuals\r\nresponsible for these crimes at an international level. At the\r\nDiplomatic Conference held in Rome, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nwith the support of Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\r\nmember States and some other States, was successful in\r\nensuring that the international community did not lose\r\nsight of the importance of the inclusion of the crimes of\r\nthe illicit traffic in narcotic drugs within the jurisdiction\r\nof the Court. As a result, the Diplomatic Conference\r\nrecommended that an acceptable definition and the\r\ninclusion of drug crimes be considered by a review\r\nconference to be convened after the entry into force of the\r\nStatute.\r\nDrug trafficking and the associated crimes of money-\r\nlaundering and trafficking in arms continue to pose\r\nserious threats to the social, economic and political\r\nfoundations of countries of the Caribbean, and to erode\r\nthe moral fabric of our societies. We welcome the\r\nconclusions and recommendations of the twentieth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on the world drug\r\nproblem, held in June 1998, and we pledge our\r\ncommitment to cooperate at the international, regional and\r\nnational levels in the achievement of the goals and ideals\r\nwhich we adopted at that session.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago will persist in its efforts on a\r\nregional basis to foster the type of cooperation that would\r\ncombat the scourge of drug trafficking. Such action\r\nincludes the implementation of the 1994 Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action, which facilitates effective drug\r\ncontrol cooperation in the region. Also, CARICOM\r\ncountries, with the assistance of the Governments of\r\nCanada, the United Kingdom and the United States, have\r\ncreated a witness protection programme. In addition, Port\r\nof Spain is the headquarters of the secretariat of the\r\nCaribbean Financial Action Task Force on money-\r\nlaundering.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is\r\ncooperating at the bilateral level with the three countries\r\njust mentioned in areas such as extradition and maritime\r\ncounter-drug operations. We are also the beneficiary of\r\ntechnical assistance in the strengthening of our Counter\r\nDrug Crime Task Force to facilitate our efforts in\r\naddressing this menace to society.\r\nAction at the national level includes the\r\nestablishment of an agency to coordinate the overall\r\nefforts against drug-trafficking and the preparation of a\r\nmaster plan to deal with the problem. A strong legal\r\nframework has been put in place to enable prosecutions\r\nand investigations. Appropriate legislation to facilitate\r\njudicial cooperation with other countries and participation\r\nin regional and multilateral institutions has also been\r\nenacted. Legislation currently before Parliament will\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nsignificantly improve the provisions against money-\r\nlaundering.\r\nThe eradication of drug-trafficking, money-laundering,\r\nand the traffic in arms and their associated evils must be a\r\ntask for all Member States. The deleterious effects on our\r\nsmall societies threaten future generations of our peoples\r\nand have significant negative repercussions on our\r\nvulnerable economies. The eradication of this affliction of\r\nour societies is a sine qua non for development and for the\r\nachievement of international peace, security and justice.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago shares the sadness, shock and\r\noutrage of the international community at the recent\r\nterrorist attacks on United States embassies in Tanzania and\r\nKenya, as well as at the bombings in South Africa and in\r\nIreland. This spectre of terrorism continues to rear its ugly\r\nhead in our world, in spite of the numerous efforts that\r\nhave been undertaken on a multilateral level to eradicate\r\nthis evil.\r\nAt the second informal consultations of the Council\r\nfor Foreign and Community Relations, held in New York\r\non 24 September 1998, Caribbean Community Foreign\r\nMinisters condemned the recent terrorist attacks in several\r\nparts of the world and reiterated their strongest commitment\r\nto the fight against international terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations. They also pledged that their respective\r\nGovernments would consider acceding to relevant\r\ninternational conventions and protocols on international\r\nterrorism. The Ministers reaffirmed that the most effective\r\nway to confront international terrorism is through an\r\nenhanced multilateral approach and multilateral actions, and\r\nwith appropriate oversight and accountability measures.\r\nInternational conferences have also attempted to draw\r\nup a blueprint for addressing the environmental problems\r\nthat plague the nations of the world. In 1992, at the Earth\r\nSummit in Rio, the international community for the first\r\ntime linked environmental and economic issues. The\r\nBarbados Programme of Action adopted two years later,\r\nwhich addressed the specific problems of small island\r\ndeveloping States, complements Agenda 21, the blueprint\r\nfor sustainable development adopted at Rio. The small\r\nisland developing States (SIDS) Programme of Action,\r\nwhich is to be reviewed at a special session of the General\r\nAssembly next year, is therefore of critical importance to\r\nsmall island States. We anticipate that the results of the\r\nreview will be more promising than those of Agenda 21.\r\nThe pace of globalization and economic liberalization\r\nhas heightened the economic problems that developing\r\ncountries face. This is evidenced in, among other things,\r\nthe collapse of the financial markets, the unfair terms of\r\ntrade and the developing countries’ increasing difficulty\r\nin accessing the markets of the developed countries. The\r\ncrisis presently facing many States and the gathering\r\ngloom over the world economy pose very real dangers for\r\ndeveloping countries and therefore call for properly\r\ndevised strategies and the establishment of new\r\nmechanisms to ensure our survival.\r\nRecent developments within the international\r\neconomic and financial arena are clear indications that the\r\nworld economic system is crying out for urgent change.\r\nThe imperfections, which are becoming increasingly\r\nglaring, can no longer be ignored. We cannot simply bear\r\nwitness to the events. We must act now or lose a golden\r\nopportunity to influence the changes which are in the best\r\ninterest of all humanity. We must have healthy,\r\nconstructive dialogue at all levels and develop the\r\npolitical will and direction to find relevant solutions.\r\nTo this end, I wish to reiterate the call made by the\r\nhonourable Minister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and\r\nTobago, Mr. Ralph Maraj, at the Twelfth Conference of\r\nHeads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries, held last month in Durban, South\r\nAfrica, for the convening of a United Nations conference\r\non the world economy. It is evident from the views\r\nexpressed from this podium during the last two weeks\r\nthat Member States recognize the need for urgent action\r\nat the international level to address this issue.\r\nIn this volatile economic environment, small island\r\ndeveloping States are rendered even more vulnerable by\r\ntheir inherent features of size, remoteness, insularity and\r\nsusceptibility to natural disasters. Indeed, in one fell\r\nswoop any small advances in economic development can\r\nbe brought to nought by natural disasters. The devastation\r\nwreaked by the recent Hurricane Georges on small States\r\nof the Caribbean bears sad testimony to this reality.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago shares the grief of its Caribbean\r\nneighbours at the loss of life and the damage to property\r\nsuffered in this hurricane. As is the case with other\r\ndeveloping countries, the needs of small island developing\r\nStates cannot be addressed without the full support and\r\ncooperation of the international community. Trinidad and\r\nTobago continues to make every effort to provide\r\nassistance to the islands affected by this disaster, in\r\ncooperation with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency\r\nResponse Agency, a regional agency established to deal\r\nwith all types of disasters.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nTrinidad and Tobago has succeeded to some extent in\r\nachieving integration into the world economy as it\r\nundertakes the transition from an oil-dependent, public-\r\nsector dominated economy to a more diversified market-\r\noriented private-sector led one. There is still a pressing\r\nneed, however, for employment-generating growth from\r\nnon-traditional labour-intensive sectors which will have\r\nmore pointed impact on the reduction in poverty and\r\nunemployment levels in our country.\r\nOur people are hurting. It is imperative therefore that\r\nthe United Nations programmes for development be\r\ndirected more specifically towards employment creation\r\nopportunities for our peoples.\r\nTrade policy is an important area of concentration of\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO). Developing\r\ncountries, including small island States, are being asked to\r\ncompete with developed countries while unequal levels of\r\neconomic development persist — and to do so in a very\r\ndifficult economic environment and within unrealistic time-\r\nframes. Small States must adopt a series of policy changes\r\nto reorient their economies and diversify their production\r\nbases. While implementing these measures, they must also\r\ndevelop their internal capacities to deal simultaneously with\r\nsuch policy changes. This cannot be achieved in the short\r\nterm without a high degree of support from the regional\r\nand international organizations and the international\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nIt is imperative that we find innovative ways to bridge\r\nthe gap between the United Nations and private citizens. It\r\nis in this context that we welcome the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations Fund for International Partnerships, which\r\nwill strengthen partnerships to support the United Nations\r\nand its projects and deliver resources to programmes and\r\npeoples served by United Nations agencies. The approval\r\nof grants for projects in the broad categories of children’s\r\nhealth, environment and climate change, women and\r\npopulation, food security, drug control, poverty alleviation\r\nand landmines will contribute significantly to the pursuit of\r\nthe goals of the United Nations. The establishment of this\r\nFund is testimony to what can be achieved by a shared\r\nvision and commitment to the principles and ideals of the\r\nOrganization. We urge optimum use of the benefits to be\r\nderived from the Fund.\r\nAs we observe the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights this year, Trinidad and\r\nTobago would like to restate its commitment to the\r\nprotection and promotion of human rights and the\r\nfundamental freedoms of its citizens. The Constitution of\r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago guarantees human\r\nrights and freedom to all its citizens, without\r\ndiscrimination based on race, origin, colour, religion or\r\nsex. The right to life, liberty, security of the person and\r\nthe right not to be deprived thereof, except by due\r\nprocess of law, are guaranteed by the Constitution. Also\r\nguaranteed are the right not to be subjected to cruel and\r\nunusual treatment or punishment, the right to a fair trial,\r\nfreedom of expression and freedom of the press. An\r\nindependent judiciary is ever vigilant to ensure that these\r\nrights are not abrogated or infringed.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is fully\r\ncognizant of its duty to protect the security and well-\r\nbeing of its citizens, including the innocent, the victims of\r\nviolence and the vulnerable. Their rights have also been\r\nguaranteed by the Constitution. We do not subscribe to\r\nthe current trend that subordinates the rights of these\r\ncitizens to those of the perpetrators of violent crimes\r\nagainst them. We are of the view that our innocent\r\ncitizens also deserve the Government’s protection of their\r\nbasic rights to life and security of the person.\r\nWe cannot speak of development without focusing\r\nspecific attention on the problems of social development,\r\npoverty eradication and sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment. The international community must, now\r\nmore than ever, jointly seek to ensure both the economic\r\nwell-being and the social development of all its peoples.\r\nIn this regard, the United Nations has made tremendous\r\nstrides in its efforts to confront the problems of\r\ndevelopment and to improve the quality of life of\r\nhumankind. We are aware that, to this end, a number of\r\ntools have been devised to enable the international\r\ncommunity to build a consensus in the social and\r\neconomic fields.\r\nIt is of special significance to Trinidad and Tobago\r\nthat, in accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n50/161 of 22 December 1995, a special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will be convened in the year 2000 for\r\nan overall review and appraisal of the implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the 1995 World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment and to consider further actions and\r\ninitiatives.\r\nThe 10 commitments undertaken at the World\r\nSummit in Copenhagen constitute strong imperatives by\r\nMember States and the international community to\r\nachieve social development with the well-being of\r\nindividuals in the society at the core. One of the\r\ncommitments given priority attention at the Copenhagen\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nSummit was the eradication of poverty. However, poverty\r\nlevels remain alarmingly high, and more practical initiatives\r\ntowards eradicating poverty are essential. We are pleased\r\nthat the General Assembly has identified this as a priority\r\nissue and has dedicated the period 1997-2006 as the first\r\nUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty in\r\norder to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty\r\nand reducing overall poverty substantially in the world.\r\nThe effect of globalization and its impact on social\r\ndevelopment must be carefully studied. The United Nations\r\nand its relevant bodies will be a useful forum for this\r\ndiscourse.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago sees these as some of the issues\r\nwhich the Preparatory Committee for the special session\r\nshould consider when it convenes its substantive sessions in\r\nMay 1999 and April 2000 to ensure that the special session\r\nwill be meaningful.\r\nIn September 1995, at the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women, firm commitments were undertaken to improve\r\nthe status of women by adopting the Beijing Declaration\r\nand Platform for Action. Follow-up activities are under way\r\nand should continue apace vigorously to ensure that the\r\nmandates of the Beijing Conference are fully implemented.\r\nAn area which requires special focus is the enhancement of\r\nwomen’s involvement in the development process. We\r\nwelcome the decision taken by the General Assembly in\r\nDecember 1997 to convene in the year 2000 a high-level\r\nplenary review to appraise and assess the progress achieved\r\nin the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action\r\nand to consider further action and initiatives.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago attaches great significance to the\r\nrights of children. We are committed to ensuring that they\r\nare neither disadvantaged nor deprived in any fashion of the\r\nmeans necessary for their wholesome development and their\r\nfull integration into society. Since the entry into force of\r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, Trinidad and\r\nTobago has taken a number of measures to promote and\r\npursue the mandates of the Convention. Steps have also\r\nbeen taken to achieve national awareness in this area,\r\nincluding the elaboration of a national Plan of Action for\r\nthe Survival, Protection and Development of Children, the\r\npromotion of the rights of children through school and\r\ncommunity outreach programmes and the establishment of\r\na Child Registry for monitoring children in need of special\r\nprotection. Measures are also being undertaken with respect\r\nto the harmonization and codification of all laws relating to\r\nchildren, as well as the establishment of a Family Court.\r\nWe are on a swift march towards the new\r\nmillennium. Let us, as a community of nations, renew our\r\nresolve to work towards the achievement of the goals we\r\nhave set for ourselves: goals of peace, security, justice\r\nand development for all. Political will and commitment\r\nare necessary for this process, as is a genuine appreciation\r\nof the realities faced by each individual member of the\r\ninternational community in the pursuit of these goals.\r\nWe, the Member States of the United Nations, must\r\nnot lose sight of the interdependence of development and\r\nthe attainment of these ideals. As we formulate new\r\npolicies in our strategy for the improvement of all aspects\r\nof the lives of humankind, and as we invent new\r\nmodalities for their implementation, we are encouraged by\r\nthe many successes we have had, especially in recent\r\nyears.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago pledges to continue to work\r\nassiduously in its efforts to establish the foundations for\r\na peaceful, secure and just world. This is the only legacy\r\nwe must leave to future generations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mali and\r\nfor Malians living abroad, His Excellency Mr. Modibo\r\nSidibe.\r\nMr. Sidibe (Mali) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me first of all, on behalf of the delegation of Mali,\r\nto extend to Mr. Didier Opertti my very warm\r\ncongratulations on his outstanding election to guide the\r\nwork of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nTo ensure the success of the lofty mission entrusted to\r\nhim, I wish to assure him that he will have the full and\r\nopen cooperation of my country’s delegation. I would also\r\nlike to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko, President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsecond session, for the skill and ability with which he\r\nguided our work at a time when the reform of the United\r\nNations occupied a prominent place on the agenda of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nI also take this opportunity to convey to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan and his team all our gratitude for\r\ntheir tireless commitment in the service of the ideals of\r\nthe United Nations. The delegation of Mali fully\r\nappreciates his programme of reforms designed to adapt\r\nour Organization to the changing realities of the world.\r\nThe fifty-third session of the General Assembly has\r\nopened at a time when the growing impoverishment of\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nthe poorest countries, the resurgence of hotbeds of tension\r\nand the difficulties incumbent in a stronger and more united\r\ncooperation are demonstrating that the rhythm of\r\ninternational change is unprecedented and requires our\r\nOrganization’s attention.\r\nIndeed, it would now appear that increased\r\ninterdependence and the globalization of the economy are\r\ncontributing heavily to the rise of new tensions and creating\r\nprofound imbalances for the developing countries. The\r\nentire world, under the yoke of the logic of extreme\r\ncompetition, is going through a phase of profound\r\nconfusion. Everywhere, North and South, workers live\r\nunder the remorseless threat of market rules, which grow\r\nmurkier and more pitiless every day. Financial crises are\r\nlikely to undermine the developing countries’ efforts at\r\neconomic reform.\r\nThe imbalance between North and South is being\r\nexacerbated, the gaps are widening and differences\r\nbecoming entrenched. Characterized by a disparity in\r\nincome, access to services and the possibility of living in\r\ndignity, poverty is growing in the developing countries and\r\neven spreading within the developed world.\r\nMy delegation certainly believes that, if genuine social\r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction are to be achieved,\r\nstrong economic growth is necessary and that the poorest\r\ncountries must have access to markets in order to better\r\nparticipate, on a sustainable basis, in the world economy. In\r\nthis respect, we welcome the Secretary-General’s suggestion\r\nthat the developing countries be encouraged to participate\r\nmore actively in the drafting of new international standards\r\nand in ensuring that these standards be transparent.\r\nSpecifically, non-tariff barriers should be eliminated for\r\nAfrican and the least developed countries; vigorous\r\nmeasures should be adopted to ease the debt burden,\r\nwhether by converting the public debt of the poorest\r\ncountries into grants or by easing access to the Debt\r\nInitiative for the heavily indebted poor countries.\r\nBut let us make no mistake: what is truly at stake\r\ntoday is a globalization focused on sustainable human\r\ndevelopment. The challenge at the end of this century and\r\ninto the twenty-first will be to close the gap between North\r\nand South.\r\nIn this respect, as the highest authorities have said; we\r\nare convinced that the history of humanity is the history of\r\nmen. Our constant quest for man is our roadmap for the\r\nworld’s progress. Our struggle will always be against a\r\nblind global market and in favour of sharing and solidarity.\r\nLet us have economic growth, by all means, but let our\r\nwork and its fruit be shared so as to end these\r\ninequalities. Let us not close our eyes: Where there is\r\ninjustice and iniquity, there is no peace.\r\nRespect for human and national rights is an integral\r\nfactor for economic prosperity and social equity, as well\r\nas for promoting and maintaining peace and security. We\r\ncan achieve such respect and right such imbalances if,\r\nthrough a renewed political dialogue undertaken in all\r\nresponsibility and candour, we tackle the challenges with\r\nglobal vision and solidarity, in the conviction of true\r\npartnership and shared and equal responsibility in the\r\nbuilding of a better world, a world of humanity.\r\nIn this context, the major challenge facing the\r\nGovernment of Mali today is achieving sustainable human\r\ndevelopment through the struggle against poverty. This\r\ndevelopment hinges on a strengthened process of\r\ndemocratization, the rule of law and the implementation\r\nof decentralization, the vehicle for local development,\r\ndesigned and guided by the people.\r\nMali is rigorously pursuing a freely agreed policy of\r\neconomic reform and entrenching its democracy. The\r\npositive results of these efforts, though fragile, are very\r\nencouraging, but there remain problems and difficulties\r\nwhich our programmes — howsoever participatory —\r\nwill require major outside assistance, peace and stability\r\nin our subregion, Africa and the world to solve. The same\r\nholds true for many countries, especially in Africa, which,\r\nthrough the courageous reforms they have undertaken, are\r\nonce again on the road to economic growth.\r\nLike them, we intend to continue and consolidate our\r\neconomic reforms with strong growth aimed at poverty\r\nreduction. The international community, however, must\r\nreverse the trend towards decreased official development\r\nassistance, which is essential to our basic minimum needs.\r\nWe pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the United\r\nNations system and our development partners and urge an\r\nincrease in official development assistance, without which\r\nwe will scarcely enjoy the benefits of our reforms,\r\nundertaken with so much sacrifice in the fight against\r\npoverty.\r\nWe also need a partnership aimed at strengthening\r\nour economic capacities to convert and market our\r\ncommodities, facilitating their access to markets,\r\npromoting the resurgence of our private sectors and\r\nincreasing flows of direct foreign investments. All this\r\nmust take place in a more favourable economic\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nenvironment if unemployment and poverty are to be\r\nconsistently reduced.\r\nThe end of the cold war transformed the international\r\ncontext for United Nations missions and activities. In the\r\nsphere of international peace and security, our Organization\r\nis now taken up with domestic conflicts that often have\r\nserious international repercussions. Unfortunately, in many\r\ncases, recent events allow us to assume that this type of\r\nconflict will continue to claim our attention.\r\nNow that certain guiding principles in the area of\r\npeace and security are widely accepted, it is quite obvious\r\nthat peacekeeping will remain our priority objective. It is\r\ntherefore essential that we improve our preventive system\r\nand strengthen our institution’s capacity to organize and\r\nlead these operations efficiently and successfully.\r\nFor its part, Mali will always fight for more peace,\r\njustice and solidarity throughout the world. For us, security\r\nand development are indissoluble. The grave crises shaking\r\nthe world, and Africa in particular, strengthen our\r\nconviction that the United Nations, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the subregional organizations\r\nmust cooperate closely with one another in the search for\r\neffective early warning, conflict prevention and\r\nmanagement, and peacekeeping mechanisms. In this\r\nframework, and with particular reference to Africa, the\r\nprevention of conflicts and disarmament are of great\r\nconcern.\r\nGiven all of the challenges of democracy, development\r\nand security that Africa must meet, President Alpha Oumar\r\nKonaré of the Republic of Mali said a few weeks ago that:\r\n“The development of the continent must be\r\nmanaged on new terms. The difficult situation of our\r\ncontinent has arisen almost everywhere as a result of\r\ndemocratic failures, which we must redress in our\r\nyoung and fragile democracies by an essential\r\ndemocratic commitment. We must promote pluralistic\r\nexpression, the transfer of power and dialogue founded\r\non law. We must eschew violence.\r\n“The future of our continent does not lie in the\r\nemergence of ethnic republics, which will only lead us\r\ninto general anarchy. It is important, we feel, not to\r\ndeny, much less crush expressions of autonomy. They\r\nmust be managed politically in a democratic context\r\nof the basic transfer of power and the emergence of\r\nlocal power with a view towards regional integration.\r\n“Thirty-eight years after the independence won\r\nin 1960, there is no question of redrawing the\r\nborders inherited from colonialism, but nothing\r\ntoday can justify border conflicts. We must be able\r\nto settle all border disputes politically. It is essential\r\ntoday that any ill-defined border be corrected in\r\nserenity, not in the heat of tension. The OAU’s\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\r\nand Resolution should be able to speed that forward.\r\n“At a time when everyone is welcoming\r\nintegration, borders must have a different meaning.\r\nThey must be managed as border countries, joint\r\nareas and shared space.”\r\nPresident Konaré also said that:\r\n“Post-election periods are also increasingly\r\nbecoming times of conflict. This must be prevented\r\nby the proper preparation for elections, because\r\nsome recent incidents of electoral challenge have\r\nthreatened democracy. People must know that the\r\nonly access to power is through the ballot box,\r\nwhence all legitimacy flows. Everyone must\r\nparticipate.\r\n“We must therefore seek to control electoral\r\nchallenges without ever endangering pluralistic\r\nexpression and the transfer of power. Strength must\r\nalways reside in law and right — the whole law and\r\nright and nothing but law and right — and oppose\r\nany impulse to disorder and violence.”\r\nIn the view of the President of the Republic of Mali,\r\n“Africa can no longer be managed as it has been\r\nsince 1960. A new Africa is on the move, an Africa\r\nwhich wishes to define its future and take\r\nresponsibility for its own development; which is\r\nsearching for solidarity, not alms; which is\r\nresponsible and confident. It is an Africa once and\r\nfor all on its own feet, a democratic Africa.”\r\nThat Africa more than ever needs security and peace. To\r\nhave that security and peace, Africa must, like the rest of\r\nthe world, be free from weapons of mass destruction and\r\nconventional weapons, particularly light weapons.\r\nWith regard to disarmament, Mali hails the decisions\r\nof the Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT), in particular on the Treaty’s permanent extension.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nWe also hail the entry into force on 29 April 1997 of the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention and the progress in\r\nnegotiations regarding the Biological Weapons Convention.\r\nWe warmly welcome the coming entry into force of the\r\nConvention on anti-personnel landmines. Mali, which\r\nratified this Convention early on, began last May destroying\r\nits stocks, which Mali’s army had never used.\r\nWhile welcoming also the notable progress made on\r\ninstruments regarding weapons of mass destruction, Mali is\r\ndeeply concerned about conventional weapons, which\r\nremain an area so far unexplored and not subject to\r\ninternational norms. Recent conflicts, particularly in Africa,\r\nwhich have claimed so many human lives, are fuelled not\r\nby weapons of mass destruction, but by light weapons. That\r\nis why my country, together with the United Nations and\r\nthe countries of the West African subregion, has undertaken\r\nspecific initiatives to counter this phenomenon.\r\nWe are pleased by the welcome given to President\r\nKonaré’s initiative regarding the moratorium on the import,\r\nexport and production of light weapons by the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), and more\r\nrecently by the Organization of African Unity during the\r\nOuagadougou summit and by the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nat the Durban summit. But it is important now to go further\r\nto reduce and contain the threat of the proliferation of light\r\nweapons. This moratorium is in essence a confidence-\r\nbuilding measure, aiming over the long term to strengthen\r\nthe ability of the Governments involved to exert stricter\r\ncontrol over the illegal traffic in light weapons.\r\nHere we wish to pay tribute to the far-sightedness and\r\nresponsible commitment of the ECOWAS countries, which\r\nplan to announce a moratorium soon. This will be a\r\nprecedent demonstrating Africa’s clear will to prevent\r\nconflicts by exerting pressure on the means which incite\r\nand fuel them. The international community must keep up\r\nthe momentum by mobilizing around the issue of light\r\nweapons, supporting the moratorium and making it effective\r\nby implementing a programme of coordination and\r\nassistance for security and development, which underpin the\r\nmoratorium and help to widen it.\r\nWe are an active party, and we support the proposals\r\nthat emerge daily for tracking the illegal traffic in light\r\nweapons and establishing a control mechanism. Although\r\nit is a complex and difficult matter, we must work together\r\nenergetically to perfect such a mechanism.\r\nThere must be more support for resolution 52/38 C,\r\nregarding assistance to States for curbing the illicit traffic\r\nin small arms and collecting them, and States must\r\ndemand more on this issue of the international community\r\nand the United Nations, which we congratulate on the\r\naction already taken. We must show our commitment to\r\nmake vigorous progress in creating a mechanism to curb\r\nthis matter and, at the same time, actively support\r\ninitiatives such as the moratorium, consciousness-raising\r\nand the mobilization of all State and non-State actors to\r\nbetter ensure peace and reduce the threat posed by this\r\nillegal proliferation to people, particularly women and\r\nchildren, and to States and democracy.\r\nOn behalf of the delegation of Mali, I would like\r\nonce again to voice our solidarity with and compassion\r\nfor all the peoples of the world who are still living in\r\nconflict situations.\r\nRegarding the Middle East, we are deeply concerned\r\nover the deadlock in the peace process and the policy of\r\nfait accompli aimed at changing the religious, civil and\r\nhistoric character of the Holy City of Al-Quds. The\r\nagreements concluded on the basis of “land for peace”\r\nmust be implemented. We reaffirm our unswerving\r\nsupport for the just struggle of the fraternal Palestinian\r\npeople to realize their legitimate right to self-\r\ndetermination and to establish an independent State.\r\nWe remain convinced that in Angola scrupulous\r\nrespect for the Lusaka Protocol is the only path to lasting\r\npeace and reconciliation. I wish once again to honour the\r\nmemory of Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, and the seven\r\nmembers of his team who tragically perished on the road\r\nto peace in Angola.\r\nWe have continually voiced our grave concern about\r\nthe suffering of the fraternal people of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya as a result of the embargo imposed on it.\r\nWhile noting recent events, we should like to recall the\r\ndecision taken by the heads of State or Government of the\r\nOAU at their recent summit and to reaffirm that the time\r\nhas come to end the suffering of the fraternal Libyan\r\npeople by lifting the embargo and finding a lasting\r\nsolution.\r\nConcerned about acts of terrorism, which we\r\ncondemn in all its forms, Mali firmly condemned the\r\nlethal attacks against diplomatic missions of the United\r\nStates in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi. We reiterate our\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims and call for\r\ngreater international cooperation to prevent and combat\r\nthis threat. We also call for the convening of an\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\ninternational conference on terrorism under the aegis of the\r\nUnited Nations, whose exclusive competence in the area of\r\ninternational peace and security we need increasingly to\r\nreaffirm.\r\nI would like to conclude on the issue of the expansion\r\nof the Security Council. Clearly this body, which was\r\nconceived in a context quite different from today’s, cannot\r\nbe left untouched in the course of reform. My delegation\r\nendorses the demands of Africa for democratization and an\r\nequitable distribution of the two categories of seats,\r\npermanent and non-permanent, with all the prerogatives and\r\npowers that go with them.\r\nWe are convinced that a restructured United Nations,\r\ndemocratic and given essential powers, can help ensure a\r\nmore orderly management of world affairs by eliminating\r\nthe injustices, disparities and selfishness which threaten\r\nmankind, so that nations can finally, in a spirit of solidarity,\r\ndevote their resources and their energy to the progress and\r\ndevelopment of mankind.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe next speaker is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Equatorial Guinea,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Miguel Oyono Ndong Mifumu, on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. Oyono Ndong Mifumu (Equatorial Guinea)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): First of all, I would like to\r\nexpress to Mr. Didier Opertti the sincere congratulations of\r\nthe delegation of Equatorial Guinea on his unanimous\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI also wish to congratulate Ambassador Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko of Ukraine and to express my appreciation for\r\nthe enormous amount of work he accomplished as President\r\nat the last session.\r\nMay I also reiterate to the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, our brother Kofi Annan, my country’s\r\nsupport for the efforts he is making to find viable solutions\r\nto conflicts in various parts of the world, and particularly\r\nin Africa. I would like to encourage him to continue with\r\nthe reforms he has undertaken to adapt and restructure the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOnce again, we are gathered here to consider and\r\nreflect on the great challenges humanity is confronting and\r\nwill have to continue to confront at the threshold of the\r\nnew millennium. Every year in this same forum we see that\r\nthe same causes produce the same effects, but solutions\r\nare slow to arrive. The fact is that we are all victims of\r\nour own contradictions.\r\nFrom this rostrum, we have been repeating for the\r\npast 50 years that humankind wants no more wars, that it\r\nwants a lasting peace. Nevertheless, the large industrial\r\ncomplexes continue to produce more weapons that are\r\nincreasingly sophisticated and deadly.\r\nWe are assured that the priority at the end of the\r\ncentury is the fight against poverty and the\r\nunderdevelopment of nations in the framework of the\r\nglobalization of our economies. Yet the problems of\r\nhunger, malnutrition, disease and unemployment are\r\nassuming alarming proportions, and in many cases the\r\ngrowth of these problems is even more apparent than in\r\nthe past. In the meantime, the peoples of the world\r\ncontinue to wait, and their future is filled with\r\nuncertainty.\r\nLet us be honest: disarmament is possible only if the\r\nlarge weapons-producing complexes are dismantled. To\r\nclaim the contrary is pure contradiction. Disarmament\r\nrequires the same approach as the fight against drugs —\r\nin other words, the destruction of the centres of\r\nproduction, distribution and sale. There is no need for me\r\nto elaborate on this issue, since the solution is in the\r\nhands of those who benefit from this illicit trade.\r\nHowever, I do wish to refer to two questions that are\r\nthe subject of debate at this session of the General\r\nAssembly: the phenomenon of globalization and the fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nIn connection with the former, we have serious\r\ndoubts and questions regarding the sincerity of this\r\ndialogue among nations. On the one hand, we have those\r\nwho offer many pretexts for continuing to obstruct free\r\ntrade, the free circulation of goods and persons and the\r\ntransfer of technology, and who erect other barriers that\r\nprevent the developing countries from achieving\r\nsustainable economic growth.\r\nAs for the African continent, we all know that the\r\nUruguay Round is an instrument for marginalizing the\r\ndeveloping countries, nor are we unaware that the\r\npayment of foreign debt remains a means of exporting\r\ncapital precisely to those who do not need it. Under these\r\ncircumstances, how can we devise an agenda for the\r\nglobalization of economic relations between the developed\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nNorth and the developing South, in a framework of\r\nfairness?\r\nGlobalization must begin with fair prices for our raw\r\nmaterials. The immense opportunities and advantages\r\noffered to the world markets by the developing countries of\r\nAfrica must be put to use in the context of a sincere\r\npartnership between North and South. No one has chosen\r\nmarginalization. The question is, should it be forced on us?\r\nSome detractors of the African continent apply\r\nsimplistic reasoning when they categorically state that the\r\nprinciple causes of poverty and marginalization in Africa\r\nare political in nature: poor governance, corruption and\r\narmed conflict.\r\nWithout trying to discard these arguments, we believe\r\nthat they do not justify the unfair treatment of our raw\r\nmaterials in the most profitable markets of the North. Nor\r\ndo we believe that the marginalization now suffered by the\r\nAfrican continent is an inevitable phenomenon. A great deal\r\nis being done to inscribe our countries in the current agenda\r\nof globalization. The ongoing processes of subregional and\r\nregional integration are evidence of the political will that\r\ntoday infuses African leaders.\r\nWe wonder about the degree of sincerity and\r\ntransparency in the dialogue aimed at facilitating the full\r\nintegration of the African economies into the mechanisms\r\nfor globalization of trade and into technological advances.\r\nAs for globalization, it should mean that everyone sells\r\nwhat he has and wherever he wishes, without the customs,\r\nadministrative and tariff barriers that today prevent the free\r\naccess of the products of the South to the markets of the\r\nNorth.\r\nFurthermore, the ever present issue of foreign debt\r\nremains an obstacle to economic growth in many\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMy country, Equatorial Guinea, sincerely believes that\r\nthis situation is not fortuitous, and far less is it due to a\r\nlack of potential or a lack of opportunity. What we call for\r\nis not simply assistance. We want our own efforts to be\r\nvalued; we want use to be made of the various\r\nopportunities we can offer to the world of globalization that\r\nlies ahead.\r\nNevertheless, all of this also requires the peace and\r\nsocio-political stability of nations. Unfortunately, it would\r\nseem that everything is being done to create instability in\r\nour countries. Today, we are seriously threatened from\r\noutside and within our borders by terrorism and\r\nmercenary actions carried out by individuals or groups\r\nblinded by hunger for power, ethnic hatred, racism and\r\nthe desire for hegemony.\r\nFor the first time in its history, my country has\r\nexperienced, in the course of the past 18 months, two acts\r\nof armed destabilization. One was on 17 May 1997, when\r\na ship carrying arms and mercenaries was detained by the\r\nAngolan police in its territorial waters. The other was on\r\n21 January of this year, when a group of individuals\r\nattacked a number of towns in my country and murdered\r\nsix persons in cold blood.\r\nWhat justification can there be for terrorist actions\r\nsuch as those perpetrated against the United States\r\nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania? What justification can\r\nthere be for a band of terrorists who murder peaceful\r\ncitizens in cold blood? What political claims can justify\r\nthe murder and mutilation of another human being, as\r\noccurred in my country?\r\nOn this question, some countries present here are\r\nacting with a double standard; depending on their own\r\ninterests, terrorist actions are justifiable or not. When\r\nthese actions take place within a developing country,\r\nsome powerful communications media invoke, among\r\nother such fallacies, the “struggle for the freedom of\r\npeoples” to do away with regimes that, according to them,\r\nare dictatorial. But when similar actions of the same type\r\ntake place in any country of the North, then the story\r\nchanges, and those responsible for such actions are called\r\nterrorists and enemies of society.\r\nThat double standard was evident when such actions\r\nreceived the support and solidarity of certain Spanish\r\npolitical groups and elements of the Spanish\r\ncommunications media. Only the Government of that\r\ncountry condemned those acts. On the other hand, a lobby\r\nwas formed from among several political parties — the\r\nBasque Nationalist Party, the United Left and the Spanish\r\nSocialist Workers’ Party — each of which published\r\ncommuniqués expressing their solidarity with the\r\nperpetrators of those terrorist acts. Since then, those same\r\ngroups have been trying to fabricate an ethnic problem in\r\nmy country. They have promoted a number of resolutions\r\nagainst my country in various international forums,\r\nincluding in recent meetings of the European Parliament\r\nand the Joint Assembly of the European Union and the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, in a clear\r\nattempt to justify the terrorist acts in question.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nMy Government, however, faithful to its commitment\r\nto establish a State based on the rule of law in Equatorial\r\nGuinea, held a public trial, with procedural guarantees and\r\ninternational observers. Furthermore, the 15 death sentences\r\nimposed on the main perpetrators of those crimes have been\r\ncommuted by the President of the Republic of Equatorial\r\nGuinea, Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, in an effort to\r\npreserve the social unity of the nation. But it seems that\r\nsuch measures still do not satisfy the political circles that\r\nare persisting in their attempts to destabilize the peaceful\r\npeople of Equatorial Guinea.\r\nNevertheless, I would like to assure the Assembly that,\r\nthanks to the maturity of the people of Equatorial Guinea\r\nand because of their peaceful spirit and openness to\r\ndialogue and democratic debate, we have been free from\r\nthe serious upheavals experienced by some countries and\r\nregions of our continent as a result of such actions.\r\nThe internal realities of Equatorial Guinea therefore\r\nbear no relation to the systematic campaign of hounding\r\nand harassment that has been waged against it for several\r\nyears. Peace and stability prevail, investments are flowing\r\nin and there are real signs of growth. The political reforms\r\nare irreversible, our State of law is being strengthened and\r\nthe better governance of the country is being promoted. To\r\nthat end, the Government of Equatorial Guinea has relations\r\nof cooperation with several international organizations and\r\nfriendly countries for the establishment of technical\r\nassistance programmes in the fields of economics,\r\ndemocracy, human rights and governance. We are\r\ncontinuing to cooperate with the United Nations\r\nCommission on Human Rights, and our cooperation with\r\nthe international financial institutions is positive in the areas\r\nto which I have referred.\r\nWe are clearly living during a time of promise and\r\nrebirth in our country. We appeal here to the international\r\ncommunity to show its solidarity by supporting our efforts\r\nto consolidate the democratic process and the\r\nimplementation of the plan for the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment of the country, outlined by the national\r\neconomic conference, which took place in Bata from 8 to\r\n14 September 1997.\r\nWith regard to the African continent, we urge the\r\ninternational community to find mechanisms geared to\r\nachieving a ceasefire and ending the hostilities in the Great\r\nLakes region and to restoring peace and order in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nSierra Leone, Eritrea and Ethiopia. To that end, we wish to\r\nreaffirm here the recommendations contained in the Bata\r\ndeclaration for the promotion of democracy, peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa, which was adopted by\r\nthe subregional conference on democratic institutions and\r\npeace in Central Africa, held from 18 to 21 May 1998\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, at which the\r\nPresident of Equatorial Guinea recommended the creation\r\nof a subregional parliament to deal with issues so as to\r\nguarantee peace and security in the subregion. Equatorial\r\nGuinea pledges to make its contribution to the attainment\r\nof that objective.\r\nFinally, my country reaffirms its support for the\r\nnecessary reform of the Security Council. With regard to\r\nthe increase of its membership, we are in favour of\r\nequitable distribution so that our Organization will be able\r\nfaithfully to reflect the geopolitical realities of today’s\r\nworld. In this context, Equatorial Guinea associates itself\r\nwith the position, adopted at the twelfth summit of the\r\nnon-aligned countries held a month ago in Durban, South\r\nAfrica, that Africa should have two permanent seats and\r\nfive non-permanent seats, in the interests of the credibility\r\nand democratization of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe next speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nMadagascar, Her Excellency Mrs. Lila Hanitra\r\nRatsifandrihamanana, on whom I now call.\r\nMrs. Ratsifandrihamanana (Madagascar)\r\n(interpretation from French): The General Assembly has\r\nunanimously chosen Mr. Opertti to direct the work of its\r\nfifty-third session. Echoing previous speakers, I should\r\nlike to congratulate him, as I consider his election a\r\ntribute to his personal qualities as a diplomat and a\r\nstatesman. Through me, Madagascar is pleased to express\r\nits best wishes for the success of his mission.\r\nHis predecessor, whose competence we valued, was\r\nable to rely on our cooperation throughout his term of\r\noffice; and Mr. Opertti may also be assured of our\r\ncomplete support in his efforts to accomplish his task\r\nsuccessfully.\r\nMadagascar reiterates its encouragement and support\r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in his quest for\r\nways and means to make our Organization increasingly\r\ndynamic.\r\nThe great family of the United Nations is meeting\r\nonce again, as it does every year, to reflect collectively on\r\nthe situation in the world so as to lay the foundations for\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\na better existence, one which is safer and more equitable,\r\nin spite of all our differences and divergences.\r\nMadagascar reaffirms its support for the United\r\nNations though its presence every year at this annual\r\ngathering. For us, this forum for exchanging views\r\nrepresents the first, universal bastion against injustice and\r\nviolence in the world, and it is the best tool for\r\nsafeguarding peace and security and for the promotion of\r\nprogress.\r\nIn the light of the statements made here, globalization\r\nundoubtedly constitutes the backdrop for our many concerns\r\nat this end of the century. With all its advantages,\r\ndisadvantages and disappointments, and transcending the\r\nlimits of the economic framework, globalization is today\r\nexpressing itself in terms of insecurity.\r\nInsecurity is spreading virtually everywhere, in many\r\nforms and manifestations. Insecurity is being globalized,\r\nand whenever a man dies — whether it be in a war, or as\r\na bombing victim, or in a cold-blooded massacre, or simply\r\nin his sickbed — somewhere children cry, women suffer by\r\nthe hundreds, by the thousands, by the millions. And death\r\nis more than ever part of our daily lives. This is why today\r\nwe are focusing our attention on the problems of insecurity\r\nand on the need to rally our efforts for the maintenance of\r\npeace.\r\nThe international community is now confronting\r\nsituations that jeopardize peace and security and that\r\nthreaten the sustainable development of nations. In many\r\nparts of the world, civil wars, inter-State conflicts, border\r\ndisputes, and ethnic, tribal and religious confrontations\r\nresurface, bringing suffering, poverty, political instability\r\nand marginalization, be it in Kosovo, the Comoros, the\r\nGreat Lakes region or elsewhere.\r\nAdded to this is the persistence of new threats, such\r\nas international terrorism, organized crime, corruption, the\r\nproliferation of narcotic drugs and the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment. Access to weapons of mass destruction is\r\nbecoming easier and easier. The proliferation of the light-\r\nweapons industry and the widespread use of those weapons\r\nare becoming a major scourge for most countries.\r\nInsecurity is economic as well as social. In the era of\r\ntechnological progress and of the spectacular growth in\r\nworld food production, whole regions are experiencing\r\nfamine and malnutrition. One quarter of the world’s\r\npopulation is still living in poverty. Millions of children\r\nunder the age of five continue to die of diseases, and major\r\nsectors of society are cut off from education and from\r\nbasic health care. About 180 million children under the\r\nage of 14 are obliged to work; the less fortunate have no\r\nalternative except sexual exploitation, and for many young\r\npeople unemployment is the only prospect for the future.\r\nSimilarly, a large number of women cannot to this very\r\nday exercise their fundamental rights. Many remain\r\nvictims of domestic violence, social injustice, deliberate\r\nmassacres or armed conflict.\r\nMoreover, the financial upheaval that has afflicted\r\nSouth-East Asia, Latin America and Russia has shaken\r\nthe international economic system. It is true that global\r\ninformation networks have reduced both distances and\r\ntime, but at the same time they have contributed to\r\nincreasing scientific, cultural and moral insecurity.\r\nComputer viruses have become as dangerous as nuclear,\r\nbiological and chemical weapons. All of this illustrates\r\nthe magnitude and the drawbacks of globalization, as well\r\nas the scope of the interdependence of States.\r\nFifty years after the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, the rights and freedoms inherent in the dignity and\r\nworth of the human person are still often violated, and we\r\nwitness the burgeoning of new challenges — challenges\r\nthat are ever different and that require well-adapted and\r\nbetter-planned strategies. It is obvious that no State in the\r\nworld can guarantee each of its citizens material and\r\nspiritual well-being in conditions of peace and full respect\r\nfor the most basic rights and freedoms.\r\nWhile in the recent past — and more specifically in\r\n1985, from this same rostrum — emphasis was placed on\r\nthe balance of forces, in general, and on nuclear parity, in\r\nparticular, everyone today unanimously recognizes that\r\nsecurity cannot exist without cooperation and solidarity,\r\nwhich implies spectacular changes in international\r\nrelations. Evidence of this recognition is the forthcoming\r\nentry into force, on 1 March 1999, of the international\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on\r\nTheir Destruction, as well as the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones.\r\nFor its part, Madagascar, which has never deviated\r\nfrom its commitment to disarmament and which is, in this\r\nrespect, a signatory of a number of international\r\nConventions, is gratified at the prospects of the\r\nnegotiation of a cut-off treaty on fissile material for\r\nmilitary purposes in the framework of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament in Geneva.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nWe also welcome the call for the holding in the near\r\nfuture of an international conference on the complete\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons, a call made by the heads\r\nof State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries who met recently in Durban. Along the same\r\nlines, Madagascar of course associates itself with the\r\nproposal made by President Blaise Compaoré, the current\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nconcerning the convening in the year 2000 of a summit\r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations with\r\na view to the formulation by the international community\r\nof a joint response to the problem of terrorism.\r\nLike other States, on 18 July, in Rome, Madagascar\r\nsigned the Statute of the International Criminal Court, as\r\nwell as the Final Act of the Diplomatic Conference of\r\nPlenipotentiaries.\r\nIt would be appropriate to consider the question of\r\nsecurity through a multidimensional approach encompassing\r\nmilitary, economic and social aspects at various levels —\r\ninternational, regional and national.\r\nPoverty and the persistence of imbalances that divide\r\nthe world into developed countries, developing countries,\r\nleast developed countries, poor and indebted countries, are\r\nfactors contributing to tension and obstacles to the\r\nestablishment of a genuine and lasting peace. This, in any\r\nevent, is the reality in Africa, my continent.\r\nThe Cairo Declaration of 1993 established the primary\r\nobjective of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution in Africa. Nonetheless, without\r\nthe active support of the international community, these\r\nactions would remain ineffective. Security Council\r\nresolution 1170 (1998), on the holding of regular ministerial\r\nmeetings in order to evaluate actions undertaken for peace\r\nin Africa, should therefore be welcomed. For Madagascar,\r\nit is a question of confirming the will to coordinate actions\r\nof the United Nations with the pan-African organization and\r\nwith regional mechanisms.\r\nWhile awaiting an appropriate mobilization of the\r\nresources needed for the effective implementation of actions\r\nin the framework of the Agenda for Development, it seems\r\nto us vital that the developing countries make their\r\ncontribution by proposing the establishment of a mechanism\r\nto help them attain their shared aspirations and affirm their\r\nsolidarity.\r\nIt is in this spirit that the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries,\r\nmeeting at Durban, considered a proposal to establish,\r\nwithin the Non-Aligned Movement, a mechanism\r\nconsisting of three funds financed by our own resources,\r\nup to perhaps 0.1 per cent of gross national product or a\r\npercentage of export income. The funds thus obtained\r\nwould be capitalized through investment in international\r\nfinancial markets.\r\nFor Madagascar, this mechanism would help\r\nintegrate the activities of developing countries into the\r\nprocess of financial globalization and would help resolve,\r\nat least in part, their financial and debt problems, in\r\ntandem with the actions undertaken by the international\r\ncommunity and the financial institutions. A large number\r\nof speakers during that session recommended an\r\nevaluation of the capacity of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions to adapt to current realities. The three-fund\r\nmechanism could be among the basic documents for joint\r\nreflection on a new global financial architecture.\r\nIn implementing the resolutions of the international\r\ncommunity, it is a key responsibility of each country to\r\ncreate a climate conducive to lasting peace and economic\r\ngrowth. Among the elements of this responsibility are the\r\nestablishment of regulations that are in keeping with\r\nagreed aspirations, good governance, the creation of\r\nadequate systems for follow-up and monitoring, and\r\nrespect for the rules of democracy. In the present context\r\nof global economic liberalization, every development\r\nactor has its own role to play, including the State as the\r\nprotector of the fundamental rights of its people and of its\r\nsovereignty and as a catalyst for development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nMadagascar, whose Constitution and national laws\r\nare based on the principles of the United Nations Charter,\r\nendorses those values. In that connection, we are engaged\r\nin the process of democratization, good governance and\r\nthe rule of law, along with economic and structural\r\nreforms, to lead our country towards credible partnership\r\nin the international system. Our authorities are now\r\ncommitted to implementing recovery programmes aimed\r\nat stepping up the struggle against poverty and at creating\r\na climate conducive to the complete fulfilment of the\r\ncitizen.\r\nThe institutional aspects of this programme include\r\nthe establishment of autonomous provinces and of\r\ninstitutions provided for in the Constitution, and the\r\ncontinued reform of the civil service and the judiciary\r\nsystem.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nIn the economic sphere, the State is continuing to pull\r\nout of the production sector, and will be doing all in its\r\npower to create an environment of vigour and competition\r\nand to put financial administration on a sound footing\r\nthrough the creation of bodies to regulate sector-based\r\nactivities.\r\nFinally, in the social area, public expenditures will\r\nreflect our priorities: education, health and safety, and\r\nsecurity. We are devoting special attention to programmes\r\nto make the most disadvantaged segments of the population\r\naware of their own responsibilities.\r\nAlthough the implementation of this programme\r\ndepends first and foremost on Madagascar’s own efforts, it\r\nis obvious that there are limits on our resources for\r\nguaranteeing a better quality of life for our citizens and\r\nthus for protecting their rights. The strengthening of\r\ninternational partnership should therefore be viewed not\r\nonly from the financial but also from the scientific and\r\ntechnological standpoints, so that all countries may hope for\r\nan equal chance of success. Of that I am convinced.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\ncall next on His Excellency Mr. Haile Weldensae, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Weldensae (Eritrea): I wish to join those who\r\nhave spoken before me in congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti\r\non his election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of\r\nthe General Assembly. His vast experience and skill assure\r\nus that he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly to\r\na successful end. I assure him of the full support of my\r\ndelegation as he carries out his important mandate.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to his\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of\r\nUkraine, for his outstanding leadership during his tenure\r\nlast session.\r\nThe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, deserves appreciation for his commendable efforts\r\nand for the effective leadership he has provided to ensure\r\nthe realization of the ideals of our Organization by making\r\nthe United Nations more effective and better able to serve\r\nits Members.\r\nThe end of the cold war, even if only briefly, raised\r\nhopes and expectations and sent tidings of a more peaceful,\r\nsafer, just and fair world safeguarded from conflict and\r\ntension, hunger and disease. Such hopes and expectations\r\nwere to be frustrated rather early as the world was plunged\r\nin numerous conflicts between and with States, ethnic\r\nviolence and hatred, terrorism, gross violations of human\r\nrights, racism and xenophobia, as well as mass starvation\r\nand an increase in the number of refugees and displaced\r\npersons.\r\nThe international community cannot dismiss or,\r\nmuch less, ignore this situation, which in some cases has\r\ncaused the commission of serious international crimes, not\r\nonly because it is generally the innocent and the weak —\r\nwomen, children and the elderly — who are the first\r\nvictims, but also because this situation, which now seems\r\nto be limited to certain regions, may soon engulf wider\r\nareas of the world. In the face of these harsh realities, it\r\nis incumbent on the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity to search for fresh, innovative approaches\r\nwith a view to eliminating the root causes of this\r\nsituation, in order to ensure respect for the basic\r\nprinciples of the Charter, to save the innocent from the\r\nscourge of terrorism and to protect the human and civil\r\nrights of ethnic minorities. If they fail to do so, it will not\r\nonly prolong the agony of the victims but will, in fact,\r\nsooner or later, threaten regional as well as international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe founding fathers of our Organization recognized\r\neconomic development as one of humanity’s inalienable\r\nrights, and set as one of the goals of the United Nations\r\nthe promotion of social progress and better standards of\r\nlife in larger freedom. I am certain that all developing\r\ncountries would declare in no uncertain terms that this\r\ngoal has so far been unattained.\r\nThe situation in Africa is cause for serious concern.\r\nIn spite of the great efforts exerted by regional and\r\nsubregional organizations and agencies, the situation in\r\nmany parts of the continent is deteriorating and becoming\r\nmore dangerous by the day. The tragic bloodshed and\r\nsuffering that Africans have witnessed in the recent past\r\nin various parts of the continent are too horrible to recite.\r\nThey must not recur and, where they continue to exist,\r\nthey must be stopped.\r\nIn the Great Lakes region, conflicts are developing\r\nmuch wider ramifications, in spite of their seeming\r\nregional containment. They pose a grave threat to peace\r\nand security, as they may soon involve extraregional\r\nPowers. It is hoped that through ongoing regional\r\ninitiatives it will be possible to formulate just and\r\nmutually acceptable solutions. In the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Africans and the rest of the world have\r\nbeen forced to witness the disheartening spectacle of an\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nAfrican country which had barely emerged from the cruel\r\ndestruction of a rapacious dictatorship being once again\r\nravaged by multifaceted fighting. This has also divided the\r\nbroad African coalition which had contributed to the\r\npromotion of peace and security in that country. This sad\r\nstate of affairs must be quickly reversed on the basis of full\r\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and a recognition that\r\nthe internal political process is the sole prerogative of the\r\nCongolese people, and with awareness of the need for a\r\nregional framework of cooperation to address the security\r\nconcerns of the countries of the region.\r\nSomalia and the Sudan continue to be sources of\r\nanguish and sorrow for Africa, because there is still a lack\r\nof progress in the efforts to resolve the crises in both\r\ncountries. The frustration of the international community at\r\nthe lack of progress in peacemaking in both countries is\r\nunderstandable. It must be noted, however, that genuine\r\nefforts continue to be made by the countries of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and\r\nthe international community must not despair or give up,\r\nbut must contribute to the efforts of these countries if they\r\nare to be successful. In this connection, my delegation\r\nupholds the view that with regard to the Sudan conflict\r\nIGAD’s Declaration of Principles and consequent\r\nresolutions remain the sound basis for a just and lasting\r\nsolution to the conflict.\r\nIn my statement last year I declared that Eritrea’s\r\nforeign policy rested on two basic tenets. The first was the\r\ndeep conviction that where there is goodwill all disputes\r\ncan be resolved through peaceful negotiations and methods\r\nwithout recourse to violence. The second tenet was the\r\nunswerving devotion of Eritrea to justice and equality. I\r\nalso declared that these two tenets have influenced our\r\nsearch for friendship and cooperation with our neighbours,\r\nas well as with other States. This statement is as valid\r\ntoday as it was last year.\r\nThe commitment of the Government of Eritrea to\r\nthese two tenets has helped to defuse conflict with the\r\nRepublic of Yemen and to arrive at a mutual understanding\r\nto resolve the dispute over the Eritrean archipelago of\r\nHanish-Zukar in the Red Sea by peaceful means through\r\narbitration.\r\nToday, too, the Government of Eritrea insists that the\r\nroad to peace with Ethiopia is by a strict application and\r\nenforcement of the principles of the Charters of the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), as\r\nwell as the OAU decision on colonial borders. Once again,\r\nEritrea calls upon the international community,\r\nparticularly the United Nations and the OAU, to ensure\r\nrespect for these principles and the decision.\r\nEritrea was surprised and disturbed by the eruption\r\nof conflict with Ethiopia because, in spite of\r\ndisagreements on the issue of boundaries, dating back to\r\nthe days of armed struggle the Eritrean Government had\r\nassumed and hoped that in view of the close relations\r\nbetween the two countries, it was possible to arrive at an\r\namicable and enduring solution.\r\nThe responsibility for the escalation of the dispute\r\nrests solely with the Government of Ethiopia, which has\r\nfor a long period of time consistently violated the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Eritrea, resulting in\r\nthe occupation of large tracts of Eritrean territory,\r\nfollowed by the forced displacement of Eritrean peasants\r\nand the replacement of Eritrean administrative structures\r\nby Ethiopian institutions. It reached a climax on 6 May\r\nonly as a result of the further unprovoked incursions by\r\nmembers of the Ethiopian armed forces, which attacked\r\nEritrean troops in the Badme region, in south-western\r\nEritrea. These incursions were premeditated and\r\nmeticulously planned. This is the root cause of the\r\ndispute.\r\nFor a long time Eritreans had opted for patient and\r\nquiet diplomacy. They had hoped against hope that the\r\nperiodic incursions were only the petty acts of some\r\nmiscreant and ill-advised regional officials. It was only at\r\na very late stage — and particularly after the publication\r\nin 1997 of an official map of the Tigray administrative\r\nzone incorporating additional indisputably Eritrean\r\nterritory and after the issuance of the new Ethiopian\r\ncurrency note depicting the same map — that they\r\nrealized the full meaning of the Ethiopian adventure. Yet,\r\neven in the aftermath of the fighting that was triggered by\r\nthe unprovoked Ethiopian incursion and attacks on\r\nEritrean troops, Eritrea never crossed its internationally\r\nrecognized border; but Ethiopia still controls other\r\nEritrean territory in south-western Eritrea.\r\nIn spite of all this evidence of its aggressive deeds,\r\nthe Ethiopian Government is conducting an absurd\r\npropaganda campaign to portray Eritrea as a\r\nwarmongering nation which has committed aggression\r\nagainst, and occupies, Ethiopian territory. Nothing could\r\nbe further from the truth. At no time have Eritrean troops\r\ncrossed Eritrea’s internationally recognized borders as\r\neverybody can see. On the contrary, it was Ethiopian\r\ntroops that invaded Eritrea after Prime Minister Meles\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nZenawi’s declaration of war on 13 May 1998. They were\r\nrepulsed. It is important to note that the Deputy Foreign\r\nMinister of Ethiopia, Dr. Tekeda Alemu, had articulated\r\nEthiopia’s expansionist designs by publicly declaring in a\r\nspeech to members of the Ethiopian community in the\r\nUnited States that Ethiopia would occupy the Eritrean port\r\nof Assab within a short time. In the light of the above,\r\nEthiopia’s claims that it is the victim of aggression and will\r\nnot negotiate unless Eritrea withdraws from “its territory”\r\nare obviously false and only meant to hoodwink the\r\ninternational community and to cover up its own acts of\r\naggression.\r\nEven today, Ethiopia is threatening war unless Eritrea\r\nwithdraws unconditionally from territories which are fully\r\nwithin its internationally recognized borders. Today\r\nvirtually the whole of the Ethiopian army has taken\r\npositions along the Eritrean border, and almost all of the\r\nhighest leaders of Ethiopia, including the President, the\r\nPrime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of\r\nDefence, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, the\r\nPresident of the Tigray region and a Senior Official of the\r\nTPLF have publicly declared in just the past few days that\r\nEthiopia has finalized war preparations and will soon teach\r\nEritreans lessons they will never forget.\r\nIt is regrettable, therefore, that all the goodwill and\r\nefforts of the Eritrean Government, consisting of several\r\nconstructive proposals, to bring about a peaceful and legal\r\nsettlement of the present border dispute with Ethiopia, on\r\nthe basis of the OAU resolution on colonial borders, have\r\nbeen consistently rejected by the Ethiopian Government,\r\nwhich obdurately pursues a policy which is committed to\r\nthe settlement of matters by military means. The Ethiopian\r\nGovernment has also rejected all overtures by third parties\r\nfor a peaceful solution of the dispute and all calls made by\r\nthe international community to seek a peaceful solution.\r\nThis expansionist and aggressive policy is underscored\r\nby the use or threat of force, as well as a massive and\r\nmalicious propaganda campaign against Eritrea. The\r\npropaganda campaign accents ethnic hatred and vituperation\r\nagainst and slander of the Eritrean people and members of\r\nthe Eritrean Government. It also calls upon the Eritrean\r\npeople to rise up against their Government.\r\nAt the same time, the Ethiopian Government has been\r\nsystematically and wilfully violating the most sacred and\r\ncherished provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, the two International Covenants and several other\r\ninternational human rights instruments, as well as the\r\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations and OAU\r\nCharters, by deporting or expelling more than 20,000\r\nEritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin under\r\nextremely unhealthy conditions or dumping them in very\r\ndangerous places, and by deliberately separating family\r\nmembers, exposing them to inhuman, cruel and degrading\r\ntreatment and confiscating their property. These acts have\r\nbeen well documented by third parties, including members\r\nof United Nations agencies, heads of mission of member\r\nStates of the European Union and several non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nYet the Ethiopian Government, in an amazingly\r\nrefined application of the Orwellian principle, accuses the\r\nEritrean Government of precisely the outrages and\r\natrocities it itself has been committing against Eritreans\r\nand Ethiopians of Eritrean origin. The truth is that the\r\nEritrean Government has not detained, expelled, deported\r\nor otherwise violated the rights — human or otherwise —\r\nof Ethiopians living in Eritrea. This has been verified by\r\nlegitimate third parties like representatives of the\r\nEuropean Union, United Nations agencies and the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). As\r\nusual, the Ethiopian Government has called all of them\r\nliars. We have hitherto extended an invitation to all\r\ninterested parties to carry out an on-the-spot verification\r\nof the human rights conditions in both Eritrea and\r\nEthiopia. We now extend this invitation to members of\r\nthe Assembly. We also would like them to receive a\r\nsimilar invitation from the Ethiopian Government.\r\nThis dispute is about borders, pure and simple. Any\r\neffort to transmute it into anything else must be viewed\r\nas only a vain and brazen attempt by the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment to camouflage its aggression and its\r\nexpansionist policies. In this connection, it must be made\r\nclear that it was the Ethiopian Government which wilfully\r\nviolated Eritrea’s colonial boundaries and forcefully\r\noccupied those areas that it had incorporated into its new\r\nmap of Tigray. It was the Ethiopian Government which\r\nsubverted all Eritrean efforts to defuse the crisis and to\r\nfind a peaceful bilateral solution through their Joint\r\nBorder Commission by unleashing unprovoked military\r\nattacks on Eritrea from 6 to 12 May. It was the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment which declared war on Eritrea by a\r\nresolution of its Parliament on 13 May. It was the\r\nGovernment of Ethiopia which invaded Eritrea along\r\nseveral points on their common border. It was the\r\nGovernment of Ethiopia which launched an air strike on\r\nAsmara, the Eritrean capital, on 5 June 1998. It was the\r\nEthiopian Government which imposed an air and sea\r\nblockade by threatening indiscriminate air bombing of\r\nEritrea.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nYet Ethiopia has falsely portrayed Eritrea as an\r\naggressor country by claiming that Eritrean forces invaded\r\nEthiopian territory on 12 May. However, it is not claims\r\nand counter-claims that matter. There is incontrovertible\r\nmaterial evidence which establishes that Ethiopia has\r\ndeliberately used force and carried out military incursions\r\nin Eritrea since July 1997 with a view to covertly changing\r\nthe reality on the ground. In this connection, I wish to bring\r\nto the Assembly’s attention that the Eritrean Government\r\nhas repeatedly called for an independent investigation of the\r\nincidents that triggered the conflict.\r\nThis border dispute should not have existed in the first\r\nplace, considering that boundaries between the two States\r\nare some of the most clearly defined in Africa and were\r\nmade by explicit and detailed provisions of international\r\ntreaties. They were then confirmed by the United Nations\r\nwhen it created the ill-fated Eritrean-Ethiopian federation,\r\nand again clearly defined in the Constitution that the United\r\nNations gave to Eritrea.\r\nTrue, the borders may not have been demarcated; but\r\nthey are not the only undemarcated borders in Africa, and\r\nthe non-demarcation of boundaries has not prevented most\r\nAfrican — and indeed other — States from living in peace\r\nwith their neighbours and from solving their problems\r\npeacefully.\r\nEritrea is committed to a peaceful and legal solution\r\nof this dispute on the basis of the principles of sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of States which are enshrined in the\r\ncharters of both the United Nations and the OAU as well as\r\nthe decisions and declarations of the OAU and the Non-\r\nAligned Movement. Since before the onset of the crisis,\r\nEritrea has been attempting to initiate numerous bilateral\r\ndiscussions with Ethiopia with a view to addressing all\r\noutstanding issues related to their common borders. In this\r\nconnection, the following must be mentioned.\r\nFirst, the Eritrean Cabinet and National Assembly\r\nissued orders, on 14 and 20 May 1998 and again on 18\r\nJune 1998, respectively, for the temporary demilitarization\r\nof the areas of dispute.\r\nSecondly, the Eritrean President sent two letters to the\r\nPrime Minister of Ethiopia requesting him to join him in\r\ndefusing the dispute and settling the border issue peacefully\r\nand legally on a bilateral basis.\r\nThirdly, the Eritrean Government presented to the\r\nOAU Committee of Ambassadors a proposal containing the\r\nprinciples of respect of colonial boundaries and non-\r\nviolation of these borders; respect of the charters of the\r\nOAU and the United Nations; commitment not to use\r\nforce to impose a solution; commitment to peaceful and\r\nlegal means to solve the dispute; readiness to stop all\r\nhostilities; and readiness to enter into direct talks without\r\npreconditions.\r\nUnfortunately, all our efforts failed because of\r\nnegative responses from Ethiopia. On the other hand,\r\nEthiopia has yet to offer a single plan or peace proposal.\r\nIt has only threatened war unless Eritrea withdraws from\r\nterritories which are within the internationally recognized\r\nborders of Eritrea. In this connection, it must be\r\nmentioned that the Eritrean Government has time and\r\nagain requested the Ethiopian Government to publicly\r\nannounce to the peoples of Eritrea, Ethiopia and the\r\ninternational community the territories that it claims and\r\nto designate them on a political map with clear\r\ngeographical coordinates.\r\nIt is for these reasons that the Government of Eritrea\r\nyet again offers the following as a basis for the solution\r\nof the dispute.\r\nFirst, the comprehensive solution of the problem\r\nthrough a technical demarcation on the basis of the\r\nestablished colonial treaties that clearly define the\r\nboundary between the two countries.\r\nSecondly, a possible resort to arbitration on the basis\r\nof the sanctity of colonial borders in the event that this is\r\ndemanded by the other party.\r\nPending a lasting, legal solution, an immediate\r\ncessation of all hostilities and a ceasefire to be monitored\r\nby an observer force under the auspices of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt is a matter of satisfaction to the people and\r\nGovernment of Eritrea that numerous governmental\r\ninstitutions, international and regional organizations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, including the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States Congress, the\r\nEuropean Union and the Non-Aligned Movement, have,\r\nin welcoming the Eritrean initiative, called upon both\r\nEritrea and Ethiopia to avoid the use of force at all costs\r\nand to resolve their disputes peacefully.\r\nI wish to declare here and now, in loud and clear\r\nterms, that the Government of Eritrea welcomes, and is\r\nready to undertake to implement, a decision by the\r\nAssembly which provides without any preconditions for\r\nthe cessation of hostilities, a ceasefire agreement and a\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 25th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\npeaceful resolution of the dispute by any method as the\r\nonly acceptable solution.\r\nIn Africa, conflicts such as the present Eritrean-\r\nEthiopian border dispute have taken place several times in\r\nthe past. Each one of these conflicts was addressed on the\r\nbasis of the hallowed principles and decisions of the OAU,\r\nincluding in particular respect for colonial borders, the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States and the non-\r\nuse of force or threat of force.\r\nAs the OAU prepares itself to enter the twenty-first\r\ncentury, it is imperative that its member States rededicate\r\nthemselves to the sublime principles and resolutions that\r\nhave hitherto served our continent. These principles and\r\ndecisions, which have successfully fostered peace and\r\nstability, solved conflicts and defused tension in our\r\ncontinent in the past, will be as valid in the future as they\r\nhave been since they were first articulated. Only through\r\ntheir proper application will it be possible to defuse\r\ntension and eliminate conflict.\r\nEritrea reiterates its commitment to peace, harmony\r\nand the rule of law in international relations, however\r\npainful this tragedy may be. Eritrea seeks peace for itself\r\nand for all of its neighbours. Eritrea will continue to seek\r\ngood relations with all its neighbours.\r\nEritrea is in a race against the clock of development\r\nand cannot afford to lose the time, energy and resources\r\nwhich must be used in the war against underdevelopment.\r\nTo date, Eritrea has restrained itself against extreme\r\nprovocation, and it will continue to do so unless it is\r\nforced to defend itself. If aggression is committed against\r\ntheir country, however, Eritreans will have no choice but\r\nto defend their hard-won independence and sovereignty as\r\nwell as every inch of their territory with whatever is at\r\ntheir disposal.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
