(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 118 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/53/345/Add.6)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In a\r\nletter contained in document A/53/345/Add.6, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral informs the President of the General Assembly\r\nthat, since the issuance of his communications contained in\r\ndocument A/53/345 and addenda 1 through 5, Equatorial\r\nGuinea has made the necessary payment to reduce its\r\narrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The first\r\nspeaker is His Excellency Mr. Delfim da Silva, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Guinea-Bissau on\r\nwhom I now call.\r\nMr. Da Silva (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\ninterpretation from French text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): On behalf of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau,\r\nI am pleased to extend our congratulations to you, Sir, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-third session. I am particularly pleased because\r\nit is unanimously agreed that you have exceptional\r\nintellectual, political and diplomatic qualities which will\r\nensure the success of our deliberations. It also gives me\r\npleasure to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko, and to thank him for his dynamism and\r\ninitiative and for the integrity which he displayed\r\nthroughout his mandate.\r\nI wish to reiterate to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, our appreciation for the tangible results we have\r\nseen in the Organization since his election, and to\r\nencourage him to persevere with the same determination\r\nin implementing his reform programme, which we\r\nwholeheartedly support.\r\nAs we prepare to enter the new millennium, it is\r\nimportant to be aware of the increasing interdependence\r\nof nations, large and small, and of the consequences of\r\nglobalization, so that through fruitful dialogue at the\r\nglobal level, we may together find appropriate responses\r\nto the numerous challenges facing us, particularly the\r\nfight against international terrorism. Poverty,\r\nunderdevelopment and the major pandemics must not\r\nremain the sole responsibility of the countries affected by\r\nthese scourges, because for tomorrow’s world to be stable\r\nit must be united founded on the principles of social\r\njustice and the equality of peoples and nations. Hence, the\r\nprimacy of law must continue to guide us in seeking\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nlasting solutions to the numerous regrettable conflicts\r\nthroughout the world. We are pleased to note that all the\r\npeoples of the world share a determination to live in peace,\r\nwithin their national borders, with their neighbours and the\r\nrest of the international community.\r\nMy country welcomes the positive developments in the\r\nLockerbie affair, which has been a matter of concern to us\r\nfor many years. It has been the subject of decisions by\r\nregional organizations, such as the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and the League of Arab States, as well as the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement. We hope that the parties involved\r\nwill spare no effort to ensure that justice is done in\r\nconditions of fairness and impartiality, with all the\r\nnecessary guarantees, taking into account the recognized\r\nrights of each party. We feel that the clarifications called\r\nfor by the Libyan authorities are legitimate, because they\r\nare based on the objective criteria of neutrality and fair play\r\nwhich govern any judicial procedure worthy of the name.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau was admitted as a\r\nfully fledged member of the United Nations in September\r\n1974, following a lengthy and difficult struggle for national\r\nliberation. For almost a quarter of a century we have been\r\ncommitted to respecting and defending the principles\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter, because they are\r\nessential guidelines for active participation in international\r\nlife and for the building of our young nation.\r\nEarly on we understood that in order to give shape to\r\nour political independence we needed to establish the\r\nconditions for harmonious economic development from\r\nwhich all sections of our population could benefit. With the\r\nassistance of the international community, therefore, our\r\nyoung State focused on ways and means to build a land of\r\nfreedom and peace.\r\nIt goes without saying that 11 years of struggle for\r\nnational liberation scarred our people and left an indelible\r\nmark on their minds and bodies. Since Guinea-Bissau is a\r\npoor country with very limited resources, everything needed\r\nto be built, despite the fact that we did not have the\r\nfinancial means or the necessary skills. Therefore, inspired\r\nby the courage that enabled us to galvanize ourselves to\r\nfree our country, we set to the task determined to create the\r\nright conditions for the full development of our citizens and\r\nthe improvement of their living standards.\r\nOver the past four years we have succeeded in laying\r\nthe foundations of a democratic State based on the rule of\r\nlaw and respect for human rights. As members of the\r\nAssembly know, building a nation is a long-term task\r\nrequiring both determination and perseverance. Guinea-\r\nBissau, which is among the poorest countries of the\r\nworld, is no exception to that rule. Over the past two\r\ndecades we have focused on consolidating our national\r\nunity by strengthening the ties of solidarity that unite our\r\ncitizens, whose maturity had enabled them to wage, and\r\nsucceed in, one of the most exemplary national liberation\r\nstruggles in Africa. It is precisely this awareness of\r\nbelonging to the same people that has enabled all sectors\r\nof our population to unite and work hand in hand for the\r\ndevelopment of the country and the well-being of all.\r\nTherefore, since its independence in 1973, despite the\r\neconomic difficulties all States face, Guinea-Bissau has\r\nlived in peace and has known a period of great political\r\nstability.\r\nHowever, since 7 June our country has experienced\r\ntragedy, previously unimaginable, just when it was\r\nbeginning to make notable progress with regard to\r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights and in the\r\neconomy.\r\nAn unprecedented crisis for which we were not even\r\nminimally prepared has deeply shaken and paralysed our\r\ncountry for some four months now, endangering the\r\nfoundations of the state of law and the existence of\r\ndemocratic institutions in the Republic. The act of\r\naggression by a party of our country’s national army is a\r\nserious violation of the constitutional provisions in force\r\nin Guinea-Bissau. The international community, in\r\nparticular the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\r\nthe United Nations, have unreservedly condemned this act\r\nof aggression.\r\nFrom this podium, we wish to thank the United\r\nNations family for the solidarity and support it has\r\nprovided to the President of the Republic, Mr. João\r\nBernardo Vieira; the legal Government of the Republic of\r\nGuinea-Bissau; its leaders; and especially, the innocent,\r\nvictimized population. I should like in particular to\r\nconvey our gratitude to the neighbouring countries of\r\nGuinea-Bissau for their active solidarity with our people.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I specifically thank the\r\nauthorities of Senegal, Guinea, Cape Verde, the Gambia\r\nand Portugal for having rapidly created an appropriate\r\nrapid-response team to evacuate citizens and foreign\r\nnationals who wished to leave, especially our own\r\ndesperate compatriots, a great number of whom have\r\nsought refuge and safe haven in neighbouring countries.\r\nEach of these brother countries has distinguished itself\r\nadmirably in an exemplary display of compassion and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nhumanity. I wish to thank them most sincerely on behalf of\r\nour Government and all of my compatriots.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to the courage of my own\r\nfellow citizens and to reiterate, on behalf of our\r\nGovernment, our keen awareness of the difficulties they\r\nface and of the need to ease their suffering by finding a\r\nspeedy solution to the current crisis, so that peace and\r\nstability may be restored to our homeland, and by\r\nestablishing conditions to allow our people to return to their\r\ncountry.\r\nIt is its desire to find a peaceful and negotiated\r\nsolution to this crisis that has inspired the Government of\r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau in its contacts with the\r\nmembers of the self-proclaimed military junta. Indeed,\r\nthrough the joint mediation of members of the Community\r\nof Portuguese-Speaking Countries and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States, we have signed a\r\nceasefire and begun a constructive dialogue, which we will\r\npursue on the basis of recognition and respect for the\r\nconstitutional legality of our country and the need to work\r\ntogether to restore peace and stability.\r\nWe are grateful to all people of goodwill who have\r\ncome forward, both in Africa and overseas, to assist us in\r\novercoming all of these difficulties and in finding a final\r\nsolution to the conflict in Guinea-Bissau.\r\nThe people of Guinea-Bissau are peaceful. They have\r\nage-old relations of friendship and brotherhood with their\r\nneighbours in the Republics of Guinea, Senegal and the\r\nGambia. These relations are based on the common destiny\r\nwhich history and geography have bequeathed us. It is a\r\nprecious legacy that present and future generations must\r\npreserve and defend in the conviction that their identity and\r\ntheir social and cultural values will endure. It is this same\r\ncommitted and unfailing solidarity which enabled us to free\r\nourselves from the yoke of colonialism, as did our brothers\r\nin Guinea and Senegal.\r\nAs we have already had the opportunity to point out,\r\nthe presence of Guinean and Senegalese troops in Guinea-\r\nBissau is based on the implementation of bilateral\r\nagreements duly signed and ratified. In addition to the\r\nexistence of an unquestionably legal framework, however,\r\nit is important to know and recall that, through their\r\nintervention, the Guinean and Senegalese troops bravely\r\nassisted their comrades in arms in Guinea to overcome an\r\nattempted coup that has been condemned by the OAU, the\r\nUnited Nations and the entire international community.\r\nThey have made a courageous contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of constitutional legality and democracy in\r\nGuinea-Bissau. Allow me here to pay tribute to them for\r\ntheir decisive action and to offer them our full gratitude.\r\nFor some four months, Guinea-Bissau has been\r\nexperiencing a major tragedy that has brought great loss\r\nof human life, serious material damage and much\r\nsuffering to our people, who have been internally\r\ndisplaced and made refugees in neighbouring countries,\r\nCape Verde and Portugal.\r\nOnce again, I wish to thank the Assembly for its\r\nsolidarity with our country and people. Its assistance is\r\nvalued and will be valuable in healing the wounds and\r\nassisting all the citizens of our country to understand each\r\nother better and work together for the common future of\r\ntheir homeland. I can assure members that we will spare\r\nno effort to ensure that, through dialogue and joint\r\nendeavours, peace will return to a Guinea-Bissau united\r\nand reconciled in solidarity.\r\nMore than ever, we recognize the need to establish\r\na pluralistic democracy in a state of law and an\r\negalitarian society that will guarantee full respect for civil,\r\npolitical and human rights. Today more than ever, we are\r\naware of the importance of peace in our country and in\r\nother conflicted regions of the world where peoples of the\r\nsame country have been torn apart. I am thinking in\r\nparticular of the fratricidal wars which for some years\r\nnow have ravaged other African countries, Angola and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in particular.\r\nAt a time when we are preparing to commemorate\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, it is appropriate to proclaim our complete\r\ncommitment to the fundamental principles of democracy,\r\ngood governance and respect for human rights, which\r\nunderpin our search for harmonious development and a\r\nbetter standard of living. The international community, the\r\nUnited Nations in particular, has always heeded the\r\naspirations of the people of Guinea-Bissau. With its\r\nsolidarity, it has made our struggle for national liberation\r\nits own battle for the emancipation of peoples throughout\r\nthe world. Today, as in the past, we need its support to\r\nrebuild our country and restore confidence and hope to\r\nour compatriots, who impatiently await the moment when\r\nthey can return to their country, their homes, their\r\nfamilies, their friends and their workplaces — to peace\r\nand stability.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of\r\nRwanda, His Excellency Mr. Anastase Gasana.\r\nMr. Gasana (Rwanda) (interpretation from French):\r\nOn behalf of the people of Rwanda and on my own behalf,\r\nallow me to convey sincere and heartfelt congratulations to\r\nyou on your outstanding election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. This election\r\nreflects the unanimous recognition by States of our\r\nOrganization of your country, Uruguay. A well-deserved\r\ntribute is likewise extended to your distinguished\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, who demonstrated\r\ndedication, skill and open-mindedness at the last session.\r\nHeartfelt fraternal thanks go to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his skill, performance and far-\r\nsightedness. This fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly is the second in his term of office. The\r\nGovernment and the people of Rwanda are grateful to the\r\nSecretary-General for the working visit he made to Rwanda\r\nin May 1998. That historic visit made it possible for him to\r\ntake stock of the results of the genocide committed in\r\nRwanda in 1994, and we thank him for his words of\r\nencouragement to the Government and the people of\r\nRwanda for efforts made in the process of rebuilding the\r\ncountry.\r\nEach time we have had an opportunity to do so, the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda has supported the proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General with regard to the essential reforms of\r\nour Organization and deemed that the same proposals for\r\nreform were likewise valid for the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We are prepared to continue our contribution to\r\nand support for the collective efforts to bring about more\r\ndemocratization in the Security Council at the dawn of the\r\nthird millennium.\r\nThe existence of the specialized agencies within the\r\nUnited Nations has made this institution an instrument of\r\ndevelopment, particularly in the economic, social, political\r\nand cultural fields, and in many other areas. The\r\nGovernment of Rwanda supports the existence of the\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. The United\r\nNations reform under way should take them into account in\r\norder to better structure them to be more operational.\r\nSince the 1960s, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo has constantly been a source of concern to the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community. One\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General even lost his life there in\r\nthe search for a solution to the problems of that country.\r\nToday, more than in the past, this country, Congo —\r\nwhich has since become the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo — is experiencing the darkest times in its history,\r\nbecause genocide is being committed there on the orders\r\nof the highest authorities of that country.\r\nSince 2 August 1998, Rwanda, like everyone, has\r\nbeen witnessing a rebellion in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo against the Government and President Kabila.\r\nSince then, the Government of Rwanda has consistently\r\npointed out that that crisis is purely internal and that Mr.\r\nKabila had definitely been facing a highly structured\r\nrebellion. The commission of the Ministers for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC), composed of the four member countries\r\nZimbabwe, Tanzania, Namibia and Zambia, acknowledged\r\nin its report to SADC, following its fact-finding mission,\r\nthat a rebellion exists against Mr. Kabila in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. President Kabila\r\nhimself implicitly recognized the existence of this\r\nrebellion when he published a long list of Congolese\r\nauthorities that he banished by withdrawing their\r\nCongolese passports and issuing international arrest\r\nwarrants against them. These Congolese were banished by\r\nPresident Kabila because they are leading the Congolese\r\nrebellion against him. Mr. Kabila’s implicit recognition of\r\nthis rebellion was also shown when he arrested and\r\nimprisoned six journalists from the Kinshasa news agency\r\n“La Voix du Peuple” because he suspected them of\r\nsupporting the Congolese rebellion.\r\nThe position of Rwanda is to join its mediation\r\nefforts with those of the international community to find\r\na solution to the Congolese crisis through negotiations\r\nbetween the Congolese rebels and the Government of\r\nPresident Kabila. Unfortunately, these efforts of the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda have collided with the obstinacy\r\nof President Kabila, who believes that the solution to this\r\ninter-Congolese conflict is to persecute and massacre the\r\nBanyamulenge, the Tutsi and the Rwandese living in\r\nCongo, as well as Congolese who refuse to support his\r\ngrim designs.\r\nIn this respect, Rwanda, like other observers near\r\nand far, is concerned at the increase in human rights\r\nviolations committed by the Government of President\r\nKabila, which is inciting the people to genocide,\r\nmassacres and racial and ethnic hatred. The Government\r\nof Rwanda believes that the United Nations must\r\ncondemn the genocide as well as human rights violations\r\nbeing committed in the Democratic Republic of the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nCongo and take the necessary steps against the Government\r\nof President Kabila.\r\nThis genocide and these human rights violations are\r\ncharacterized by summary executions, incitement to hatred\r\nby President Kabila and members of his Government,\r\nmassive arrests, arbitrary detentions and forced\r\ndisappearances. With regard to summary executions and\r\nincitement to hatred taking place in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, the following facts are illustrative.\r\nThe present genocide and the massacres in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo are similar to those that occurred in\r\nRwanda in 1994 when the Radio Télévision Libre de Mille\r\nCollines (RTLM) was inciting people to hunt down Tutsis\r\nand their Hutu accomplices, as they were called by the\r\nradio station at the time.\r\nDuring the Victoria Falls Summit, which took place on\r\n7 and 8 August 1998, President Kabila declared that those\r\nwho committed genocide in Rwanda were right and were\r\nworthy of support then and now. This is tangible evidence\r\nof recruitment by President Kabila of Interahamwe militias\r\nand former members of the armed forces of Rwanda who\r\ncommitted genocide in Rwanda and took refuge in Congo\r\nBrazzaville, a fact recently denounced by the High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees.\r\nAt that same Victoria Falls Summit, President Kabila\r\nimplied that Rwanda was seeking to establish a Hima\r\nempire in the Great Lakes region. In that regard, my\r\nGovernment believes that that statement by President Kabila\r\nshows his racist leanings and theories, similar to those\r\nspread during the 1980s by the late President Habyarimana\r\nand his ilk, who invented this pseudo-empire to stifle the\r\nclaims of Rwandese refugees who had been in exile for\r\nmore than 30 years and who were beginning to vociferously\r\nreclaim their inalienable rights to unconditional return to\r\ntheir motherland.\r\nThese, then, are the racist theories cunningly invented\r\nand orchestrated by the former President of Rwanda,\r\nMr. Habyarimana, and his regime in order to demonize the\r\nTutsi. Now, unfortunately, Mr. Kabila is making use of\r\nthem once more to demonize not only the Tutsi but the\r\nwhole of Rwanda and all its people. In that context, the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda requests the international\r\ncommunity to put an end to these groundless racist theories\r\nand this campaign to demonize Rwanda and its people.\r\nPresident Kabila and his close collaborators are\r\ninciting the Congolese people to acts of mindless violence\r\nagainst any person suspected of being a rebel, any person\r\nof Tutsi origin and any person who, according to them, is\r\nin league, directly or indirectly, with the rebellion.\r\nThe governmental authorities of Kinshasa are calling\r\nupon the people, through the official media, “to treat the\r\nenemy like a virus, a mosquito, a piece of garbage that\r\nmust be crushed with determination and without mercy”.\r\nThe Congolese Minister of Justice, who after all is\r\nsupposed to be safeguarding everyone’s human rights, has\r\nsaid, “These Rwandans, these Tutsis, they are insects,\r\nmicrobes that must be methodically eradicated.”\r\nIn support of the words of President Kabila, who\r\nsaid he would export war to Rwanda, the Congolese\r\nMinister of Health, Dr. Jean-Baptiste Nsonji, stated, “The\r\nRwandans will become like snakes whose head and tail\r\nhave been cut off, unable to move, unable to escape.”\r\nIn response to these incitements to hatred and\r\nviolence spread by President Kabila and the Congolese\r\nMinister of Information, Mr. Didier Mumengi, the\r\nMinister of Health, Dr. Jean-Baptiste Nsonji, and the\r\nDirector of President Kabila’s cabinet, Mr. Yerodia\r\nAbdoulaye, the population has begun to attack persons\r\nsuspected of being in league with the rebels. People have\r\nbeen burnt alive because they were caught with red mud\r\non their shoes — red being the colour of the mud in the\r\nregion of the lower part of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, at that time occupied by rebels.\r\nThe Government’s soldiers have fired point blank at\r\nother suspects whose bodies were abandoned in the\r\nstreets. Several mentally ill people were summarily\r\nexecuted because of a rumour, spread by Kabila’s\r\nGovernment, that the rebels had disguised themselves as\r\nmadmen in order to pass unnoticed. On 27 August 1998,\r\na mentally ill person living at the corner of Kasai and\r\nUsoke streets in the town of Barumbu was riddled with\r\nbullets in the central market of Kinshasa. An unidentified\r\nperson was summarily shot down because he was caught\r\nspeaking on a cellular phone. Another person was\r\nexecuted purely and simply because he was speaking\r\nEnglish.\r\nPresident Kabila’s governmental troops are using all\r\npossible means to wipe out the evidence of the atrocities\r\nthey commit. Several witnesses, including some\r\nfishermen, agree that they saw human bodies carried on\r\nthe waters of the Congo river. Other persons suspected of\r\nbeing rebels have been buried alive in Kitambo and\r\nMasina.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nThe mass arrests, arbitrary detentions and forced\r\ndisappearances in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nhave been denounced in particular by an African human\r\nrights association (ASADHO) that works in Kinshasa. The\r\nassociation denounced these arrests and disappearances on\r\n10 August and 3 September 1998, and the following facts\r\nwere stated by this Congolese human rights association:\r\n“Several individuals of Tutsi origin were arrested and\r\narbitrarily detained in the Kokola and Tshatshi camps\r\nand in various jails belonging to the information\r\nservice and in the Kin-Mazière jail in Kinshasa-\r\nGombe; more than 500 soldiers from the former\r\nZairian armed forces were arrested, and some are still\r\nmissing to this day.\r\n“Other Congolese who are married to Tutsis, friends\r\nof Tutsis or who look like Tutsis have been arrested\r\nin connection with this inter-Congolese conflict. Some\r\npersons have been removed from their homes, their\r\nhotel rooms and even from the premises of the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) in\r\nKinshasa, as a result of curfews and various manhunt\r\noperations decreed by the Kabila Government.”\r\nAll these facts are cited from that Congolese human rights\r\nassociation.\r\nThe Rwandan Government believes, once again, that\r\nthe solution to this inter-Congolese conflict lies in political\r\nnegotiations between the Kabila Government and the rebels,\r\nfor the following reasons.\r\nFirst, the Congolese must resolve among themselves,\r\nonce and for all, the question of nationality and citizenship,\r\nthough this is not negotiable. Normally, a question of\r\nnationality or citizenship is not up for negotiation, but we\r\nbelieve that this problem has to be resolved among the\r\nCongolese. Indeed, we wonder why President Kabila’s\r\nformer ministers, such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nMr. Karaha, and the Minister of State to the Presidency of\r\nthe Republic, Mr. Bugera, and many other Congolese\r\ncitizens from the eastern part of the country have been\r\nbanished from their homes and from Congolese territory. It\r\nis Rwanda’s view that we cannot eternally have stateless\r\npeople on our borders, especially the eastern border of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nSecondly, this inter-Congolese conflict has\r\nrepercussions for the security of the neighbouring countries,\r\nparticularly Rwanda, given that Kabila’s forces are a\r\ncombination of all the criminal elements of the countries of\r\nthe region. Security in the north of Rwanda is constantly\r\nmenaced by elements of the former Rwandan Armed\r\nForces and the Interahamwe soldiers who committed the\r\ngenocide in Rwanda in 1994 and who still use Congolese\r\nterritory as a rear base in order to reprise their gruesome\r\ncrimes. The security of neighbouring countries must be a\r\nconstant source of concern to the Government and the\r\npeople of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The\r\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nmust be constantly mindful of the fact that each time the\r\nforces of evil seek to sow insecurity in a neighbouring\r\ncountry, the country of origin of these destabilizing forces\r\nforfeits its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nThirdly, the Congolese army should be national, not\r\na Katangese militia composed of followers of President\r\nKabila; the Congolese of the eastern part of the country,\r\nthe Banyamulengue, the Congolese of Masisi, those of\r\nJomba and those of Rutshuru and other eastern locales, as\r\nwell as other regions of the country, should also be part\r\nof it.\r\nFourthly, the inter-Congolese conflict will be\r\nresolved by good governance and good leadership that\r\ndoes not incite people to commit genocide and massacre\r\nof part of the population that it is supposed to protect.\r\nThe political negotiations between the Kabila Government\r\nand the rebels must encourage the emergence of this kind\r\nof leadership, which the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo so urgently needs.\r\nFifthly, the philosophy of genocide and the culture\r\nof murder that President Kabila is cultivating in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, with the assistance of\r\nformer elements of the Rwandan Armed Forces and the\r\nInterahamwe soldiers that committed the genocide in\r\nRwanda, as well as terrorists in the pay of either country,\r\nmust be quickly eradicated from the Congolese population\r\nby a new, enlightened leadership devoted to the national\r\ncause, the cause of all Congolese without exception.\r\nWe have spoken at some length on the problems of\r\nthe Great Lakes region, and particularly those of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo; this is necessary in\r\nview of my Government’s great esteem, respect and\r\nconsideration for the fraternal people of the Congo. That\r\nis why my Government shouldered its responsibility and\r\ndid its neighbourly duty to the Congolese people, inter\r\nalia by demonstrating solidarity with the fraternal people\r\nof Congo in helping it rid itself of the 32-year\r\ndictatorship of the former President Mobutu, who had\r\nbankrupted the country.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nIn its efforts to find a solution to the present crisis in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Government of\r\nRwanda supports political negotiations leading to the\r\nemergence of a leadership worthy to guide the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo to a future other than that of\r\ngenocide — which, unfortunately, is the situation under the\r\nregime of President Kabila.\r\nBut although President Kabila and his cronies have\r\nbrought disappointment and despair to the Congolese people\r\nby sowing ethnic hatred in their country, Rwanda — which\r\nhad the misfortune to be the victim of the 1994\r\ngenocide — has the right to denounce the crime against\r\nhumanity that is now being perpetrated in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, in order to prevent it from being\r\nexported to Rwanda, as appears to be on President Kabila’s\r\npolitical and military agenda.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations will speedily\r\ncondemn the genocide being perpetrated in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and will take the necessary steps to\r\nhalt it before it is too late. Copies of the Dallaire fax on the\r\ngenocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are\r\nwithout question to be found here in New York, at the\r\nUnited Nations Office at Geneva, at the European Union\r\nheadquarters in Brussels and in every Western capital. In\r\nthe light of the existence of the Dallaire fax, no one can\r\nclaim not to have been informed in time to condemn\r\nPresident Kabila’s acts of genocide and those of the\r\nInterahamwe militia and the elements of the former\r\nRwandan Armed Forces, who planned and carried out the\r\ngenocide in Rwanda more than four years ago.\r\nAt the very beginning of the crisis, the Congolese\r\nMinister of the Interior, Mr. Gaëtan Kakudji, quietly\r\napproached the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and told them that unless\r\nthey quickly organized the evacuation of all those who had\r\nbeen arrested, those people would be killed. We wonder\r\nwhat the United Nations did in response to that alarm\r\nsounded by a Congolese official, none other than the\r\nMinister of the Interior, who has now dissociated himself\r\nfrom President Kabila’s acts of genocide by abandoning his\r\nministerial post and fleeing his country for Europe,\r\naccording to information in the media. The defection of the\r\nCongolese Minister of the Interior, who is a cousin of\r\nPresident Kabila, may be food for thought, and perhaps for\r\ninspiration, for President Kabila’s new allies. Will they\r\ncontinue to support a genocidal regime that has come to be\r\nabhorred by its own people?\r\nThe Governor of Shaba-Katanga province also made\r\na discreet appeal to the United Nations and, thus, to the\r\ninternational community; he revealed that he had official\r\norders to massacre all Congolese Tutsis, anyone of\r\nRwandese origin, and any Congolese who resisted this\r\ngrim plan. How did the United Nations respond to that\r\nappeal from the Governor of Shaba-Katanga province?\r\nMany people are wondering whether or not Rwanda\r\nhas a presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThey have, indeed, made this an overriding issue. The\r\nproblem of the situation in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and of attempts to resolve it is not to find out\r\nwho is and who is not in the Congo; it is to try to\r\nunderstand why. Why is a given actor present in the\r\nCongo? What are the real reasons for such a presence\r\nthere, and why is another actor not present or even trying\r\nto be there? Why is genocide being committed in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo on the orders of the\r\nhighest authorities, including President Kabila himself?\r\nWhat is the meaning of the presence in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo of the combined genocidal forces\r\nthat came from Rwanda in 1994 — the Interahamwe\r\nmilitia, elements of the former Rwandan Armed Forces,\r\nelements of the ex-forces of the former Ugandan dictator\r\nIdi Amin Dada, terrorists in the pay of one country or\r\nanother, and other trouble-makers? Around whom and\r\nagainst whom are these fascist forces uniting in the\r\nterritory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo?\r\nWill the United Nations and the entire international\r\ncommunity wait for genocide to be committed in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo before they dispatch\r\na commission of enquiry after the event? Could not the\r\nInternational Criminal Court — whose recent\r\nestablishment through the adoption of a suitable statute\r\nwe welcome — quickly take up this matter and arrest the\r\nleader and his henchmen who are now engaged in murder\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo?\r\nThose are the real questions that in our humble view\r\nshould be asked about the present crisis in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo — a crisis to which a purely\r\npolitical solution has to be found through political\r\nnegotiations between the Government of President Kabila\r\nand the Congolese rebels.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\nnext on His Excellency Mr. Fritz Longchamp, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Worship of Haiti.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nMr. Longchamp (Haiti) (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is a true pleasure for me to address the General\r\nAssembly once more. I wish first of all to echo previous\r\nspeakers in congratulating you most warmly, Sir, on behalf\r\nof my delegation, on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. I take this\r\nopportunity also to express our gratitude to His Excellency\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko for the excellent work carried out\r\nunder his presidency.\r\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, we\r\nreaffirm our confidence in his outstanding endeavours to\r\npreserve peace and to promote development.\r\nTo all participants in the fifty-third session, I wish the\r\ngreatest success in the interests of all our peoples.\r\nMr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nTen days ago hurricane Georges passed through the\r\nCaribbean region, striking several of our countries with its\r\nfury and leaving considerable damage in its wake. I wish to\r\nexpress deepest sympathy, on behalf of Haiti, to our\r\nbrotherly Governments and peoples who, like us, were so\r\nhard hit by this unavoidable disaster.\r\nThe provisional toll in Haiti is quite heavy: 150 dead\r\nand dozens missing — more than 500,000 victims all told.\r\nThere was considerable material damage to agriculture and\r\nto infrastructure: roads and bridges were destroyed and\r\ncrops devastated in several regions. The total cost of these\r\nlosses is estimated at approximately $200 million.\r\nInternational solidarity was quickly displayed in the\r\nwake of this disaster. I would therefore like to thank all the\r\nfriendly Governments, international institutions and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations for the support they have given\r\nus thus far.\r\nWhile the present situation is serious, our concern for\r\nthe future is even greater. With over 60 per cent of our\r\nagricultural production destroyed, the outlook is extremely\r\nbleak. We fear that once emergency aid is no longer being\r\nprovided in the coming months there will be a severe\r\nshortage of foodstuffs and basic goods. We therefore appeal\r\nto the international community to extend considerable\r\nassistance to our efforts to restore and rebuild the affected\r\nzones and to support our measures to solve the public\r\nhealth problems that will arise. In this regard, we invite\r\ndelegations to support draft resolution A/53/L.2/Rev.1,\r\nwhich will soon be introduced to the General Assembly,\r\nas a first step in this direction.\r\nProfound changes have taken place in international\r\nrelations in the course of the last 10 years. The lessening\r\nof ideological confrontation and the strengthening of\r\ninterdependence among nations have provided new\r\nopportunities for closer cooperation among States. The\r\nphenomenon of globalization, which is characterized by\r\nunprecedented ties between human activities throughout\r\nthe world, has expanded further and has been propelled\r\nby spectacular growth in communications.\r\nSome had anticipated a more peaceful and united\r\nworld in the next century. Yet, less than 500 days away\r\nfrom the year 2000, the international picture is frankly\r\ndisconcerting. New hotbeds of tension have arisen in\r\nmany regions of the world, while no substantial progress\r\nhas been made to resolve various age-old conflicts. That\r\nis the case in the Middle East, where we hope that the\r\nrecent discussions held this week in Washington will\r\nserve to permanently revive the peace process that has\r\nbeen stalled for more than a year.\r\nWe deplore the armed conflicts that have brought\r\nuntold suffering on populations, be it in Kosovo, Angola,\r\nAfghanistan, the Great Lakes region or elsewhere. The\r\nRepublic of Haiti invites the parties concerned to seek a\r\nsolution to their problems through dialogue. The\r\ninternational community must also continue to carry out\r\nefforts to restore peace to these regions.\r\nInternational terrorism, of which we had hoped to\r\nhave seen the last, has re-emerged in a troubling fashion\r\nwith the terrible events that have taken place in Africa\r\nand Northern Ireland. In condemning these acts, Haiti\r\ncalls on the international community to adopt effective\r\nmeasures to combat this threat to international security.\r\nElsewhere, the world is facing a real challenge\r\nwhose consequences are incalculable on more than one\r\nfront. I am referring to drug-trafficking and its related\r\ncrimes — arms-trafficking, organized crime and money-\r\nlaundering.\r\nThe problem of drug-trafficking continues to threaten\r\nthe integrity of our territories, to weaken the foundations\r\nof our societies and to undermine the health of our\r\npeoples. Combating this scourge requires further\r\ncooperation at the bilateral, regional and international\r\nlevels, as was highlighted at the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the drugs problem. Haiti,\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nwhich has unfortunately been used as a transit country for\r\nsome of the drugs headed for markets in consumer\r\ncountries, has adopted a vigorous policy that has already\r\nbegun to bear fruit. This involves the drafting of legislative\r\nmeasures against drug-trafficking and money-laundering;\r\nthe establishment of a body entrusted with combating\r\ntrafficking in narcotic drugs; the development of\r\ncooperation with neighbouring countries; and accession to\r\ninternational instruments in this area.\r\nIn speaking of the dangers threatening the future of\r\nmankind, I must refer here to the existence of considerable\r\nstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, in particular\r\nnuclear weapons. The Republic of Haiti welcomes the\r\nrecent progress achieved in the reduction of these weapons.\r\nIt will continue to support wholeheartedly the efforts of the\r\ninternational community for their complete elimination.\r\nIn this connection, Haiti deplored the nuclear tests\r\nrecently carried out by India and Pakistan, which have\r\ncontributed to increasing tensions in that part of the world.\r\nIt invites those countries to become parties to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to sign the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nThe global economic situation at the end of this\r\ncentury has also given rise to many concerns. The\r\nphenomenon of globalization, which is characterized by a\r\nliberalization of market forces, which, according to\r\nnumerous observers, should accelerate growth and promote\r\ndevelopment, has above all been marked by greater\r\ninequality and sluggish growth. The income gap between\r\nNorth and South has continued to widen. In 1965 the\r\naverage per capita income in the G-7 countries was 20\r\ntimes that of the world’s seven poorest countries; by 1995\r\nthat figure had almost doubled.\r\nToday poverty continues to grow throughout the\r\nworld. Entire populations are victims of the serious\r\nproblems of malnutrition and abject poverty. Health care\r\nand education are inaccessible to millions of people. There\r\nhas been further destruction of the environment throughout\r\nthe world, threatening the very survival of mankind. Even\r\nmore than the countries of the third world, which have been\r\nbattered by these global developments, the least developed\r\ncountries — including my country, Haiti — find themselves\r\never more marginalized and must face a worsening of the\r\nstandard of living of their peoples. The feeling of despair\r\nis increasingly spreading among younger generations facing\r\na seemingly gloomy future. All of this poses serious threats\r\nto the very stability of our countries. This situation cries out\r\nfor the international community to redouble its efforts to\r\ncombat poverty. United and concerted long-term action\r\nthat mobilizes considerable resources is essential if we\r\nwish to achieve satisfactory results.\r\nThe magnitude of current problems poses a major\r\nchallenge to the international community. The United\r\nNations, whose primary mission is to ensure world\r\nsecurity and to promote economic and social progress for\r\npeople, is the ideal forum to discuss these questions and\r\nto search for solutions that take everyone’s interests into\r\naccount. It must be able to play the role that has been\r\nentrusted to it in order to create a global situation of\r\npeace, which will facilitate development through\r\ncooperation for all peoples. It must respond to this\r\nchallenge by using its resources effectively and by\r\nadapting itself to changes in international relations.\r\nIn this regard, the delegation of Haiti welcomes the\r\nreform process initiated by Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nto breathe new life into the Organization and to better\r\nenable it to face the increasingly complex problems of\r\ntoday’s world. The initial measures approved by the\r\nGeneral Assembly have enabled United Nations bodies to\r\nwork more coherently and consistently. We hope that\r\nfurther measures to be considered at this session will\r\nstrengthen the capacities of the United Nations to carry\r\nout its activities.\r\nReform in the Security Council, which has been\r\ndiscussed for five years now, is of capital importance\r\ngiven the role played by that organ in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Haiti continues to call for\r\ngreater openness in the functioning of the Council and for\r\ngreater participation in the decision-making process, so\r\nthat its decisions reflect the general opinion of the\r\ninternational community as a whole and not only the\r\nposition of the members of the Council.\r\nIn this context, the envisaged increase in its\r\nmembership must take into account more systematically\r\nthe principle of equitable geographical distribution. Every\r\neffort must be made to ensure that the universality of all\r\nthe planet’s inhabitants is reflected in the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nIn this respect, we welcome the dialogue between\r\nthe People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. A positive\r\noutcome to this dialogue will allow for progress in this\r\narea.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nRights. By enshrining the principle of the respect of\r\nfundamental human rights and by ensuring their promotion,\r\nthe United Nations has made a considerable contribution to\r\nthe development of an international system to protect the\r\nfundamental freedoms and ensure the emancipation of\r\npeoples throughout the world.\r\nAlong these lines, my delegation welcomes the fact\r\nthat the international community has finally acknowledged\r\nthat the right to development is an intrinsic part of\r\nfundamental human rights. But that acknowledgment is not\r\nsufficient. We must work to ensure full respect for that\r\nright by establishing programmes and by mobilizing\r\nsufficient resources.\r\nToday human rights are a reality that no Government\r\ncan ignore. In Haiti respect for human rights is guaranteed\r\nin the Constitution, and the Government is committed to\r\nensuring the full enjoyment of those rights by all. In this\r\ncontext, reform in the judicial machinery that will allow for\r\nthe consolidation of the state of law is now being\r\nimplemented. Regrettably, however, the very complex\r\nsituation resulting from a twofold electoral and\r\ngovernmental problem has made it difficult for institutions\r\nto function normally and to cooperate with the international\r\ncommunity. To overcome this handicap, the President of\r\nthe Republic, Mr. René Préval, is resolutely undertaking\r\nevery possible effort.\r\nDemocratic institutions necessarily have a role to play,\r\nbut given the regrettably slow process of democracy-\r\nbuilding, the hoped-for results have not yet been achieved\r\ndespite the numerous initiatives undertaken. It is\r\nencouraging to note, however, that these expectations and\r\ninitiatives have been undertaken within the framework of\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution, which guarantees that a\r\nviable solution will be found.\r\nSimilarly, the head of State has consulted all levels of\r\nHaitian society in order to set up a new electoral council\r\nthat will be responsible for organizing, in accordance with\r\nthe Constitution and as soon as possible, free, fair and\r\ndemocratic elections at the municipal and legislative levels.\r\nHe will do everything in his power to guarantee the\r\nparticipation of all sectors in these elections, which, duly\r\ncarried out, will help us overcome the governmental crisis\r\nthat has arisen.\r\nDespite the unfavourable circumstances that have\r\ndarkened the horizon at the dawning of the third\r\nmillennium, we must not lose hope in a better world. In\r\norder to do that, we must further develop cooperation,\r\nstrengthen our partnerships and work together to improve\r\nour peoples’ standard of living in a world where so many\r\nnatural disasters and environmental phenomena remind us\r\nof our duty to solidarity. The United Nations is the ideal\r\nframework for joining our efforts to achieve this common\r\ngoal.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe next speaker is His Excellency the Deputy Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Angola, Mr. João Bernardo\r\nMiranda.\r\nMr. Miranda (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Allow me to\r\nbegin by congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti, on behalf of\r\nthe Government of the Republic of Angola, on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We are convinced that his experience,\r\nwisdom and diplomatic skills will help us to achieve the\r\ngoals we set for this new session.\r\nAngola is especially pleased by the election of a\r\nrepresentative from Uruguay, a country that has greatly\r\ncontributed to the preservation of peace and security in\r\nthe world, as was recently demonstrated by its\r\nparticipation in the United Nations peacekeeping operation\r\nin Angola.\r\nI should like to pay tribute to the outgoing President\r\nfor the manner in which he conducted the work of this\r\nimportant body during his mandate. And a word of\r\nappreciation goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his dynamism and for the wisdom he has\r\ndemonstrated at the helm of our Organization.\r\nAlmost 10 years have passed since the end of the\r\nEast-West confrontation. We had hoped that by this time\r\nthere would have been a greater positive impact on the\r\ninternational scene, especially regarding peace and\r\nsecurity, and economic development.\r\nUnfortunately, in spite of the progress we have\r\nmade — particularly in the promotion of democratic\r\nvalues and in the greater respect for human rights, among\r\nothers — we are still witnessing the proliferation of\r\ninternal armed conflicts, violent border disputes among\r\nnations, military aggression against independent and\r\nsovereign States, continued degradation of the\r\nenvironment, and economic decline with the consequent\r\nsocial and economic deterioration, especially in\r\ndeveloping countries. We are also witnessing an increase\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nin transnational organized crime and terrorism, which poses\r\na serious threat to the stability of all nations.\r\nThis scenario casts a shadow over the prospects for\r\nthe rapid implementation of the new political world order\r\nthat emerged as a result of the end of the cold war, which\r\nwould bring peace, stability, development and democracy.\r\nWe still have a long way to go.\r\nIt is incumbent on the United Nations, given its\r\nuniversal character and singular role in international\r\nrelations, to shoulder the main responsibility in the search\r\nfor solutions to all the problems that have become obstacles\r\nto achieving peaceful development and the well-being of\r\nour peoples, and in devising fair and effective formulas that\r\nmeet the collective interests of its Members.\r\nThe question of conflict resolution and prevention\r\nshould be given high priority, for this will ensure the\r\nalleviation of tension in the world. The urgent creation of\r\nearly-warning mechanisms will certainly enable the\r\ninternational community to act in a timely manner to\r\nprevent the triggering of potential conflicts, thus avoiding\r\nthe repetition of past mistakes, such as those we have seen\r\nrecently in Africa.\r\nIn this connection, Angola shares the views of the\r\nSecretary-General as expressed in the recommendations in\r\nhis report (A/52/871) on the prevention of conflict and the\r\npromotion of sustainable development in Africa, and hopes\r\nthat the members of the Security Council will turn them\r\ninto practical action.\r\nUnited Nations international arms control efforts\r\nshould not be restricted to weapons of mass destruction. We\r\nmust urgently focus on the issue of small arms and other\r\nwar matériel sold to terrorist groups by some producer\r\ncountries. These supplies have led to an increase in armed\r\nactions by subversive groups and are an incentive to all\r\nthose who wish to take power by force. We believe that the\r\ncreation of special mechanisms for the control of small-\r\narms exports to armed groups, as well as the imposition of\r\nrestrictive measures against those States that violate them,\r\ncould help to stop the proliferation of weapons around the\r\nworld.\r\nThe United Nations, in cooperation with regional and\r\nsubregional organizations, should promote the creation of\r\ncollective defence and security mechanisms as a means to\r\nprevent the threat of conflict and guarantee the territorial\r\nintegrity, independence and sovereignty of States.\r\nThe United Nations will not be able to face many of\r\nits challenges unless it can count on the commitment and\r\nengagement of its Member States. This is especially true\r\nwith respect to the resolution of its financial crisis and the\r\nreform of its structures to conform to the new\r\ninternational reality. We feel encouraged by the reforms\r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General aimed at turning the\r\nOrganization into a more dynamic and effective body.\r\nThe reform process must be thorough and include the\r\nUnited Nations main bodies, especially the Security\r\nCouncil. The Council’s current structure is outdated.\r\nAngola supports eliminating the current geographical\r\nimbalance in the composition of the Security Council by\r\nincreasing the number of both permanent and non-\r\npermanent members to ensure that the main regions of the\r\nworld are fairly represented.\r\nThe claim of the African continent to at least two\r\npermanent seats should be adequately addressed, not only\r\nbecause the region is not currently represented at all, but\r\nalso because it is the largest regional group in the United\r\nNations. Angola also supports the Brazilian claim to a\r\npermanent seat given the exceptional role the country has\r\nplayed in United Nations activities in all areas, and\r\nespecially because it belongs to a region that has no\r\npermanent members in the Security Council.\r\nThe Republic of Angola is facing a difficult and\r\ncritical phase in its history. We cannot yet announce the\r\nend of the war and the beginning of a new era of\r\nconsolidation of democracy in Angola. The peace process\r\nand all related efforts made by both the Angolan\r\nGovernment and the international community are blocked\r\ndue to UNITA’s deliberate, systematic non-compliance\r\nwith the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, the pertinent\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and Angolan law. Mr. Jonas\r\nSavimbi has demonstrated his unwillingness to transform\r\nUNITA into a civilian political party.\r\nAs Members are aware, the Lusaka Protocol, signed\r\nby the Government and UNITA in 1994, should have led\r\nto the end of the internal conflict, which was resumed by\r\nUNITA after its defeat in the 1992 general elections. But,\r\nfour years since the agreement came into force the peace\r\nprocess has yet to be concluded, and, what is even more\r\ndangerous, it has suffered serious setbacks due to the\r\nsuccessive obstacles raised by UNITA’s militarist wing,\r\nled by Mr. Savimbi. UNITA deliberately deceived the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community when it\r\ndeclared that it was totally demilitarized. As the Security\r\nCouncil itself could determine, UNITA continues to\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nmaintain active military units with sophisticated weaponry.\r\nUNITA has also hindered the process of normalization\r\nof State administration by refusing to abandon the areas it\r\nillegally occupies. At the same time, it has initiated a new\r\nescalation of hostilities throughout the country, unleashing\r\narmed attacks against local government authorities, the\r\nnational police and the national armed forces, while also\r\nengaging in massacres of the civilian population. Hundreds\r\nof people have been killed, mostly civilians; about a million\r\nhave been displaced; and UNITA has reoccupied areas\r\nwhere State administration had already been normalized.\r\nThe United Nations Blue Helmet units and humanitarian\r\nconvoys have also been targets of UNITA’s military\r\nactions, which constitute crimes against humanity, given\r\ntheir nature and characteristics as well as the coldness and\r\ncruelty with which they are committed. They are terrorist\r\ncrimes as defined by international human rights and\r\nhumanitarian law instruments. The international community\r\ncannot passively watch these systematic abuses, which flout\r\ninternational legal and moral values.\r\nDuring the recent summit in Durban, South Africa, the\r\nheads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement condemned Jonas Savimbi for these systematic\r\nhuman rights abuses. Similarly, the heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) — well aware of the seriousness of\r\nthe Angolan situation, which has had terrible repercussions\r\nfor the whole region — held Mr. Savimbi solely\r\nresponsible for the current stalemate in the application of\r\nthe Lusaka Protocol. Due to Mr. Savimbi’s staunch pursuit\r\nof war as the only means to attain political power, he is\r\ncontinuing to reinforce his military wing’s capabilities. This\r\nbehaviour was declared by SADC to be that of a war\r\ncriminal. As has been done in some other regions of the\r\nworld, Mr. Savimbi and perhaps his closest collaborators —\r\nwho together are responsible for all the war crimes\r\ncommitted in Angola — should be made to respond in\r\ncourt for the heinous crimes they have committed over\r\nmany years.\r\nThroughout the peace process, Jonas Savimbi’s stance\r\nhas revealed a personal strategy aimed at creating\r\ngeneralized chaos in the country in order to take power by\r\nforce. The facts are clear: it does not make sense for\r\nUNITA to resort to armed struggle against a State where\r\npolitical activity is not restricted and where UNITA\r\nparticipates in its main political institutions — namely, the\r\nGovernment and Parliament. Furthermore, Angola’s armed\r\nforces include hundreds of UNITA members, including\r\ngenerals.\r\nIt is unacceptable to have a political organization\r\nsuch as UNITA, which is not even subject to international\r\nlaw, challenging each and everyone, including the\r\nSecurity Council by blatantly and systematically violating\r\nits resolutions. UNITA itself is being penalized because\r\nof one man, Mr. Savimbi, who abuses the good faith of\r\nhis countrymen who believed in UNITA as a credible\r\npolitical alternative in the emerging political system of the\r\nfledgling Angolan democracy.\r\nFor all those reasons, the Security Council in\r\nresolution 1127 (1997) tried to separate the wheat from\r\nthe chaff. In the course of imposing new sanctions against\r\nUNITA, the Council issued a list of UNITA members\r\nuniversally considered dangerous elements. This list is\r\nheaded by Mr. Savimbi, who is thereby forbidden to\r\nfreely circulate in the world. Only a criminal would\r\nreceive such a sanction from the international community.\r\nAlong those lines, the Angolan Government has\r\nsuspended UNITA members from participation in the\r\nGovernment. The Government demanded a clarification\r\nof their position vis-à-vis the peace process in Angola:\r\neither they are in favour of peace and democracy, or, like\r\ntheir leader, they choose war as a means to take political\r\npower. All those who chose peace have since resumed the\r\nactivities for which they had been appointed within the\r\nframework of the Government of Unity and National\r\nReconciliation. Recently, political leaders and party\r\ncadres, together with officers from UNITA, made it clear\r\nthat they did not support war as does Mr. Jonas Savimbi.\r\nOn 2 August, they issued a political manifesto\r\ndenouncing Mr. Savimbi’s behaviour and, in an effort to\r\nrevitalize UNITA, they created a Renovation Committee\r\nwhich removed Mr. Savimbi from the leadership of the\r\nparty. The goals defended by the UNITA Renovation\r\nCommittee in its political manifesto are those of peace\r\nand the consolidation of democracy. This renovation\r\nmovement supports the peace accords, national\r\nreconciliation and the effective transformation of UNITA\r\ninto a civilian political party, and it has given a new\r\nbreath of hope for the conclusion of the peace process.\r\nFor that reason, the Angolan Government has\r\ndecided to recognize UNITA’s Renovation Committee as\r\nits only interlocutor and partner in the implementation of\r\noutstanding tasks in the Lusaka Protocol. The SADC\r\ncountries have already recognized the Renovation\r\nCommittee, and we are convinced that the international\r\ncommunity at large will not hesitate to support and\r\npromote the efforts of the new UNITA leadership as it\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nassumes its role in the young, multi-party democracy in\r\nAngola.\r\nThe Government of Angola does not believe it is\r\neither prudent or realistic, but rather, dangerous, to yet\r\nagain give Mr. Savimbi the benefit of the doubt. This\r\nwould only lead to more false expectations, and we would\r\nbe wasting much valuable time to take appropriate\r\nmeasures in this respect.\r\nIn the light of the new situation in UNITA, the\r\nAngolan Government feels optimistic and therefore is still\r\ncommitted to the successful conclusion of the Lusaka\r\nProtocol. It will, however, continue to take all necessary\r\nmeasures against those who pursue attempts to disrupt the\r\npolitical order, so as to guarantee the territorial integrity of\r\nthe country and the protection of its citizens.\r\nFrom this rostrum we want to draw the attention of\r\ncountries, such as the Togolese Republic and Burkina Faso\r\nto the fact that the Government of Angola will not continue\r\nto tolerate the support they are providing to UNITA’s\r\nmilitarist wing led by Mr. Savimbi. This includes facilities\r\nfor military training for these groups to commit terrorist\r\nacts in Angola. This is a clear violation of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) Charter, the United Nations charter\r\nand Security Council resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997)\r\nand 1173 (1998).\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my\r\nGovernment’s heartfelt tribute to the efforts and role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the peace process in Angola, and\r\nespecially the contribution of the late Maître Blondin Beye,\r\nformer Special Representative of the Secretary-General, in\r\nsupport of peace in Angola.\r\nI would also like to reiterate my Government’s appeal\r\nto the international community to continue to render\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the displaced people in Angola\r\nand to assist in the rehabilitation of social and economic\r\ninfrastructures.\r\nAngola is also concerned about events in other areas\r\naround the world. In the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, the military invasion by foreign forces is a serious\r\nthreat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that\r\ncountry. This could also destabilize the central and southern\r\nregions of the continent. This led some countries, including\r\nAngola, to consent to the request for military aid by the\r\nCongolese authorities within the framework of the SADC\r\nOrgan on Politics, Defence and Security.\r\nThe recent summit in Victoria Falls of the leaders of\r\nthe countries involved in the problem is a step in the right\r\ndirection for the resolution of the crisis. Angola supports\r\nthe withdrawal of the invading troops and the drafting of\r\nan agreement that ensures respect by all countries in the\r\nregion of the independence, territorial integrity and\r\nsovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThis would enable that country’s authorities to begin the\r\ntask of establishing a broad internal dialogue that should\r\nlead to general elections in 1999, in accordance with the\r\ndemocratization programme established by President\r\nKabila.\r\nAngola welcomes the reinstatement of the\r\nlegitimately elected authorities in Sierra Leone and the\r\ninitiation of the process of the return of the refugees.\r\nAngola hopes this is the beginning of the normalization\r\nof the situation in that country.\r\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the signing of a ceasefire\r\nagreement between the Government and the junta opens\r\nbroad opportunities for a negotiated end to the conflict.\r\nWe salute and encourage the efforts being developed by\r\nthe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries\r\n(CPLP), where Angola, along with the countries of the\r\nregion, will continue to contribute to their efforts to foster\r\nreconciliation between brothers and sisters in Guinea-\r\nBissau.\r\nIn Western Sahara, the obstacles placed in the path\r\nof a peaceful solution have been progressively removed.\r\nAngola continues to believe that a referendum held on the\r\nbasis of fairness and justice is the best means for the\r\npeople in the territory to choose their own destiny. We\r\nsupport the continuation of United Nations and OAU joint\r\nefforts.\r\nWe would also like to call the attention of the\r\ninternational community to the problem of Somalia.\r\nAlthough we recognize that the parties to the conflict\r\nhave the primary responsibility for finding a peaceful\r\nsolution, we believe this will be possible only with the\r\nsupport of the United Nations.\r\nWe regret the lack of significant progress in the\r\nMiddle East peace process. Angola encourages the parties\r\nto comply with the commitments made under the Oslo\r\nagreement. We continue to defend the right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination, and we advocate\r\na rapid and fair resolution of the issues of the occupied\r\nArab territories, including Palestine, which should take\r\ninto account the interests of all the peoples in the region.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nWe believe that this will ease the tensions in Arab-Israeli\r\nrelations.\r\nThe situation in East Timor, a territory with which\r\nAngola shares linguistic links and a common anti-colonial\r\nstruggle, has recently seen positive developments as a result\r\nof the understanding reached between Indonesia and\r\nPortugal, under the auspices of the United Nations on the\r\nreduction of the Indonesian military presence in the\r\nterritory, will contribute to the achievement of a peaceful\r\nsolution. Angola reaffirms its support for the struggle of the\r\npeople of East Timor for their right to self-determination.\r\nThe current world economic situation raises serious\r\nconcerns, since it contributes directly to the deterioration of\r\nthe standards of living of millions of human beings,\r\nespecially those in developing countries. We are concerned\r\nby the imposition of unilateral restrictions to free trade and\r\nfinancial and economic cooperation, such as the embargo\r\nimposed against Cuba. Its victims are the most vulnerable\r\ngroups in society: women and children. The extraterritorial\r\nnature of these measures runs counter to international law\r\nand does not contribute to forging links of friendship\r\namong peoples.\r\nWe believe that we urgently need to promote\r\ninternational economic cooperation based on a partnership\r\nthat will allow all those that participate in the process to\r\nshare equitably in its gains. In spite of the implementation\r\nof endless reforms and structural adjustment programmes,\r\nas recommended by the International Monetary Fund and\r\nthe World Bank, the economies of developing countries\r\ncontinue to make such modest advances that we must\r\nquestion the real objectives of such reforms.\r\nWe join with those who have spoken before us in\r\nreiterating our need to consider establishing a new\r\ninternational economic order that is more real, more fair\r\nand more equitable, capable of strengthening the\r\ninternational financial system and supporting national\r\nefforts to promote economic development throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nIt is not enough to appeal to the understanding of the\r\ndeveloped countries. We need to be more strongly involved\r\nin the transformation of the international economic picture.\r\nThe application of measures that would have an immediate\r\nimpact, accompanied by well-structured programmes, such\r\nas the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for\r\nAfrica, deserve special attention if they are to attain the\r\nsuccess we expect of them.\r\nThe Final Declaration of the twelfth summit of non-\r\naligned countries, recently held in Durban, South Africa,\r\nalso defines some steps that can be taken to solve the\r\ncrisis, among which it underscores an increase in South-\r\nSouth cooperation.\r\nThis year, we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nThis occasion should be an incentive to develop effective\r\ninstruments to promote and protect all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, since non-respect of these rights\r\nis the main cause of conflict and instability. The\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court will be\r\na significant step in this direction. The Angolan\r\nGovernment is sparing no effort to promote, protect and\r\ndefend all human rights. Were it not for the bellicose\r\nbehaviour of Mr. Savimbi, Angola would have hosted,\r\nlate this year, the first ministerial conference of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity on human and peoples’\r\nrights in Africa. That initiative was my Government’s\r\ncontribution to the jubilee of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize the role the United\r\nNations is playing to promote and protect human rights\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Georgia, His Excellency Mr. Irakli\r\nMenagarishvili.\r\nMr. Menagarishvili (Georgia): Allow me at the\r\noutset to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nUruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, on his election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. This\r\ndecision, to which Georgia acceded with pleasure, is a\r\nfitting recognition of Uruguay’s high international\r\nauthority and a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Opertti’s\r\npersonal qualities and profound experience.\r\nAt the same time, I am honoured to have the\r\nopportunity to express my gratitude to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for his significant\r\ncontributions to the successful outcome of the previous\r\nsession.\r\nToday, as the second millennium is coming to a\r\nclose, an inevitable question pops up: What will the next,\r\nthe third, millennium be like? Indeed, for the first time\r\nsince the end of the global stand-off, the opportunity has\r\nemerged to create a qualitatively new world order based\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nupon the comprehensive development of free and\r\nindependent States. Allow me to share our observations on\r\nsome of the important issues that we face.\r\nWe have repeatedly underscored the threat to global\r\nstability posed by the spread of the disease of aggressive\r\nseparatism and the ineffectiveness of our joint efforts to\r\ncope with it. For five years now, the conflict in Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia, has been on the agendas of a number of\r\ninternational forums. The need to resolve this conflict\r\nwithin the framework of the territorial integrity of Georgia\r\nand to ensure the speedy return of hundreds of thousands of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons has been reiterated more\r\nthan once. However, we have to admit that real progress\r\ntowards the settlement of this conflict has not been\r\naccomplished.\r\nMoreover, in May 1998, as a result of the punitive\r\noperation carried out by the Abkhaz side in the Gali region\r\nof Abkhazia, Georgia, more than 60 civilians were killed,\r\nabout 1,400 houses burned and over 40,000 peaceful\r\ncivilians expelled once again from their land. The vigorous\r\nefforts of the Georgian Government at that point averted\r\nfull-scale confrontation and bloodshed.\r\nThe tragedy in the Gali region was preceded by the\r\nunfulfilled resolutions of the Security Council and by\r\ndecisions on the “ethnic cleansing” of the Georgian\r\npopulation in Abkhazia, Georgia, adopted at the Budapest\r\nand Lisbon summits of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). Thus, we are once again\r\nconfronted by the acute problem of the implementation of\r\ndecisions taken by the international community.\r\nThe Government of Georgia remains committed to a\r\npeaceful solution of the conflict and applies only political\r\nmeans, to which there is no reasonable alternative. In order\r\nto add new impetus to the peace process, we have\r\nwelcomed the creation and development of the Geneva\r\nprocess, under the auspices of the United Nations and with\r\nthe participation of the Russian Federation as facilitator, the\r\nFriends of the Secretary-General and the OSCE. More\r\nactive work should be conducted in the framework of the\r\nGeneva process on the question of the political status of\r\nAbkhazia within the Georgian State.\r\nIn our view, it is urgent to fully resume the\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nGeorgia and, in accordance with its mandate, to ensure the\r\nfreedom of its activities.\r\nThe matter of utmost importance is the safety of\r\nUNOMIG personnel in the conflict zone. Their\r\nvulnerability was again proved by the recent armed attack\r\nagainst four members of UNOMIG in Sukhumi.\r\nIn this regard, we wish to emphasize the importance\r\nof the proposal of the Secretary-General concerning the\r\ndeployment of self-protection units. Unfortunately, this\r\nquestion has turned into a subject of endless discussion.\r\nIndeed, it is unclear how the deployment of a self-\r\nprotection unit would contradict the interests of any of the\r\nparties to the conflict or any other State, when this step\r\nis intended only to facilitate UNOMIG’s intensive\r\nmonitoring and would contribute to peace in the region.\r\nWhile categorically condemning terrorist acts,\r\nregardless of the motives or where these acts might come\r\nfrom, we support the creation of joint investigative teams\r\nwith clearly defined mandates of action.\r\nThe turn of events in Abkhazia, Georgia, has shown\r\nthat some important aspects should be touched upon. First\r\namong these is the development of economic programmes\r\nof post-conflict peace-building to promote the peace\r\nprocess. We already have an example of the successful\r\nimplementation of such an approach in the settlement of\r\nthe Georgian-Ossetian conflict. The implementation of the\r\neconomic programme in close cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) has brought about the realization of\r\na number of important projects for the reconstruction of\r\nthe social and economic infrastructure in the conflict zone\r\nand, most importantly, has activated the mechanism of the\r\nreturn of refugees to their homes. Recently, we have\r\nembarked upon the implementation of the subsequent\r\nstage of the programme, which has been financed by the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nSecondly, for the success of the peace process, we\r\ndeem it necessary to formulate and effectively implement\r\nconfidence-building measures between the parties to the\r\nconflict. To this end, and for the implementation of the\r\nmeasures formulated and the coordination of work in this\r\ndirection, we believe it would be reasonable to actively\r\nengage the joint United Nations-Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe Human Rights Office in\r\nSukhumi.\r\nThe third aspect is the grave humanitarian situation\r\nexisting in internal conflicts, such as the one in Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia. I refer to the fate of hundreds of thousands of\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons. We regret that\r\nthe rights of the internally displaced persons are not\r\nprotected by an international act.\r\nPresident Shevardnadze has called upon the world\r\ncommunity to mark 1998, the year of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\r\nby elaborating a comprehensive plan for the creation of an\r\neffective international mechanism for the protection of the\r\nrights of internally displaced persons throughout the world,\r\nincluding their political rights, the right to protect their\r\nproperty and the right to return to their homes. In this\r\nregard, we actively support the proposal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral concerning the creation of an organizational\r\nstructure for the protection of the rights of displaced\r\npersons.\r\nWhen discussing the creation of a global model of\r\nsecurity for the twenty-first century, we have to admit that\r\nthe post-confrontational world is not yet secure, and the\r\nproblem of separatism is not the only threat against which\r\nwe have to consolidate our efforts.\r\nWe cannot but express our concern over the expansion\r\nof the zone of nuclear proliferation. The nuclear tests in\r\nSouth Asia have clearly made this threat far more ominous.\r\nTherefore, we call upon all States to display goodwill and\r\na commitment to peace, and to join the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nEfforts to quell the hotbeds of the so-called local\r\nconflicts have so far been unsuccessful. Georgia is deeply\r\nconcerned at the developments in Kosovo, and especially in\r\nthe north Caucasus region, namely, in Chechnya, Dagestan\r\nand across the border of North Ossetia and Ingushetia.\r\nTerrorism, with all its bloody manifestations, poses a\r\nthreat both to the region and to the world as a whole.\r\nUnfortunately, Georgia has also had its fair share of\r\nterrorism. The assassination attempt against the President of\r\nGeorgia was aimed at the destabilization of the country and\r\nof the entire region. These and the recent terrorist acts\r\nagainst the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania\r\nrequire an intensification in the fight against terrorism.\r\nTherefore, we must actively support any efforts to do away\r\nwith this evil.\r\nAs we usher in the next millennium, it is impossible\r\nnot to touch upon the problems of economic development\r\nand economic security. The process of economic\r\nglobalization raises the question of a new role for the\r\nUnited Nations as a universal institution which would\r\neffectively contribute to the development of national\r\neconomies and ensure economic security at both the\r\nregional and the global level.\r\nAll this is especially urgent for the post-Communist\r\ncountries with economies in transition. Since restoring its\r\nstatehood in 1991, Georgia has been on a difficult road,\r\nhaving gone from chaos to stability and from total\r\neconomic collapse to development. This became possible\r\nthrough democratic change and economic reforms.\r\nWe have come to believe that the successful\r\ntransition of the newly independent States to the market\r\neconomy depends entirely on their integration into the\r\ninternational economic system through regional and\r\ninterregional cooperation. A clear example of the\r\nimplementation of a large-scale programme of economic\r\ncooperation is the revival of historic Silk Road. The\r\nSummit of the Transport Corridor: Europe-Caucasia-Asia\r\n(TRACECA) member States, held recently at Baku,\r\nAzerbaijan, emphasized that the idea of an alternative\r\nroadway for the Central Asian region through the south\r\nCaucasian corridor has already turned into a significant\r\nsystem stretching across the whole Euro-Asian continent.\r\nThe economic cooperation of the Black Sea basin\r\ncountries is also very important. This area was recently\r\ntransformed into a regional economic organization, having\r\nimpressive potential and far-reaching plans.\r\nIn the course of the formation of a new world order,\r\nthe main responsibility for international peace and\r\nsecurity rests with the United Nations. An important step\r\nwould be the reform of the Security Council in\r\naccordance with the new geopolitical realities. In this\r\nregard, we reiterate our position concerning the inclusion\r\nof Germany and Japan among the permanent members of\r\nthe Council. We also support the increase in the number\r\nof non-permanent seats, providing one for the States of\r\nthe Eastern European region. We also advocate more\r\ntransparency in the work of the Security Council,\r\nincluding participation in its closed meetings by those\r\nnon-member States whose problems happen to be the\r\nsubject of the Council’s discussions.\r\nWe are aware of the importance the United Nations\r\nattaches to the timely contributions of its Member States.\r\nIn this regard, despite its economic constraints, Georgia\r\nwill do everything in its capacity to cover its indebtedness\r\nto the Organization.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nSpecial attention should be accorded to the further\r\ndevelopment of United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nWe believe that the time has come to further develop\r\nand institutionalize the system of standby arrangements.\r\nThe creation of the Multinational United Nations Standby\r\nForces High-Readiness Brigade can play an important role\r\nin preserving the peace. The same is true of the\r\nestablishment of a well-equipped headquarters from which\r\nto identify potential hotbeds of tension.\r\nGeorgia has always advocated the establishment of an\r\nInternational Criminal Court and actively participated in the\r\nRome Conference. We believe that the establishment of this\r\npermanent jurisdictional body will ensure that gross\r\nviolations of human rights and crimes against humanity no\r\nlonger go unpunished.\r\nLike many previous speakers, in my statement I have\r\nresorted to such expressions as “new challenges” and “new\r\nthreats” in the post-confrontational world. But at the same\r\ntime, the new era opens before us new and boundless\r\nhorizons and creates new opportunities in the formation of\r\na new world order. We believe that only by joint efforts\r\nand common political will can we cope with these\r\nchallenges and realize all these opportunities.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Chairman of\r\nthe delegation of Uzbekistan, His Excellency Mr. Alisher\r\nVohidov.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me first of all to offer my sincere\r\ncongratulations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nUruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, on his election to the post of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session\r\nand to wish him every success in this important task. I am\r\nconfident that his long experience and abilities will\r\ncontribute to the successful outcome of the current session\r\nof the General Assembly. I should also like to express our\r\nappreciation to the previous President of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his energetic and\r\nprofessional work.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention to the problems that are of greatest\r\nconcern to the States of our region.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe international community fully recognizes the\r\ndanger of recent developments in Afghanistan, South Asia\r\nand the Republic of Tajikistan. There is an enormous\r\npotential for conflict in this subregion today. The threat\r\nthat the Afghan conflict may explode and spread to\r\nneighbouring States remains a real one. Uzbekistan has\r\nrepeatedly appealed to the international community from\r\nthis rostrum for assistance in resolving the Afghan\r\nproblem.\r\nThis goal should be served, inter alia, by our\r\ninitiative to impose an arms embargo on Afghanistan. The\r\nappeal to halt deliveries of weaponry and matériel to all\r\nparties to the conflict has been reflected in numerous\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and awaits the creation of an\r\neffective mechanism within the United Nations so that it\r\ncan be implemented. The Six Plus Two group, with the\r\nparticipation of Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries, as\r\nwell as the United States and the Russian Federation,\r\nwhich was established as a result of a proposal by\r\nUzbekistan, is today, in our opinion, the only effective\r\ninternational mechanism within the United Nations\r\ncapable of launching the peace process. Its task is not to\r\ncondemn the warring factions, to criticize them or to\r\nsupport one of them against the others. We are united by\r\na common goal, which is to find a path to stability,\r\nsecurity and peace.\r\nA great deal of interest is now focused on energy\r\nprojects and transport communications in the region.\r\nHowever, the implementation of these projects should not\r\ncause confrontation, but should on the contrary promote\r\nstability and the development of mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation between the States of the region. Given the\r\nongoing hostilities in Afghanistan, the importance of the\r\nSix Plus Two group as a full-fledged negotiating\r\ninstrument is growing. Within that framework — and\r\nwith the cooperation of the inter-Afghan forces — it is\r\npossible not merely to elaborate the terms of\r\nreconciliation but also the necessary measures to restore\r\nstatehood to that country and bring about its economic\r\nrevival. In that connection, we fully support the decisions\r\nof the meeting of the Six Plus Two group held at the\r\nlevel of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, which took place\r\non 21 September of this year in New York. We also\r\ncommend the efforts of the Special Envoy of the\r\nSecretary-General for Afghanistan, Ambassador Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi.\r\nRecent developments in Afghanistan have confirmed\r\nthat one of the most important conditions for the\r\nrestoration of peace in the Islamic State of Afghanistan is\r\nthe achievement of consensus at the regional level and the\r\nelaboration, under the aegis of the United Nations, of a\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nsingle position to be taken by the countries that have an\r\ninfluence on events in that country. Cooperation with the\r\nAfghan factions in order to reach a speedy settlement of the\r\nAfghan conflict is the ultimate goal of the proposed on-site\r\nmeeting of the Six Plus Two group in Tashkent. We hope\r\nfor further support for this proposal from interested States\r\nand the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nThe problems that affect the vital interests of\r\nUzbekistan, in particular the establishment of lasting peace\r\nin Tajikistan, the cessation of war in Afghanistan, the\r\nimposition of an arms embargo on the Afghan zone of\r\nconflict, the establishment of a Central Asian nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone, the construction of transport\r\ncommunications and the revival of Aral Sea are all part of\r\nglobal international processes that are under way and could\r\nbe implemented under the aegis of the United Nations.\r\nI believe that the events of the last decade have\r\nconvinced everyone that no State can, on its own, resolve\r\ntransnational security problems such as illicit drug-\r\ntrafficking, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and of their components.\r\nThe Government of Uzbekistan welcomes the efforts\r\nof the United Nations to counter the spread of narcotic\r\ndrugs and to implement the Political Declaration adopted at\r\nthe twentieth special session of the General Assembly, held\r\nin New York in June 1998. Today, in some European\r\ncountries, up to 90 per cent of the narcotic drugs consumed\r\noriginate in Afghanistan. The international community is\r\naware of the need to take coordinated action to counter\r\nillegal trafficking in narcotic substances and to implement\r\nthe principles of international cooperation in this area on\r\nthe basis of mutual assistance and solidarity. However, we\r\nbelieve that these principles should also reflect specific\r\nregional aspects. In particular, once again we call for the\r\nelaboration of special programmes to plan for concrete,\r\njoint action by the States of Central Asia and the European\r\nUnion.\r\nUnfortunately, terrorist acts have become a common\r\noccurrence in many countries. Existing international\r\nmechanisms to fight terrorism, including political isolation,\r\neconomic sanctions and direct military intervention, are not\r\nachieving results. We should have no illusions about this\r\nphenomenon. Today we need coordinated and targeted\r\naction by the entire international community. In that\r\nconnection, we welcome discussion of one of the most\r\ncomplex issues in international law: the possibility of and\r\nneed for a new approach to the problem of terrorism. The\r\nimportance of resolving this whole set of problems is\r\nobvious.\r\nIn this connection, Uzbekistan has taken the\r\ninitiative to establish within the framework of the United\r\nNations a commission for the prevention of terrorist\r\nactivities and for fighting international terrorism. The\r\nmain task of such a commission would be to formulate\r\nrecommendations on questions relating to the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism. Making use of legal norms, the\r\nUnited Nations could prosecute the organizers and\r\nperpetrators of terrorist acts. If Member States support\r\nthis initiative, Uzbekistan will take an active part in\r\nbringing it to fruition.\r\nUzbekistan has consistently taken steps to ensure\r\npeace and strengthen regional security. One of these is\r\nUzbekistan’s initiative to establish a Central Asian\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. Considerable progress has\r\nalready been made to implement this idea. Allow me to\r\ncite the closing statement of the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko:\r\n“In a decision designed to further promote the\r\nregime of nuclear nonproliferation, the Assembly\r\nadopted a consensus resolution supporting the\r\ninitiative to establish one more nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone, in Central Asia. The significance of that step\r\nbecame even more apparent in the light of the recent\r\nnuclear tests in southern Asia”. (A/52/PV.92)\r\nHere, let me express our special gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Jayantha\r\nDhanapala, for their well-informed and strong support of\r\nthis initiative.\r\nWhen considering potential threats to national\r\nsecurity, we ought today to give special attention to\r\nproblems of ecological security and environmental\r\nprotection. It is common knowledge that the drying up of\r\nthe Aral Sea has caused many complex ecological, socio-\r\neconomic and demographic problems, whose origins and\r\ngravity are international, even global. The Aral crisis is\r\none of the most serious of the world’s ecological and\r\nhumanitarian disasters. It has had a direct impact on more\r\nthan 35 million people who live in the Aral Sea basin.\r\nA number of decisions have been adopted at\r\ninternational and regional meetings on the problem of the\r\nAral Sea. But these have not been backed up by practical\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\naction. We are obliged to say that the idea is gaining\r\nground in the international community that the Aral crisis\r\ncan be contained through humanitarian operations. That is\r\nnot the case. This is an extraordinary ecological problem\r\nthat requires the establishment within the United Nations\r\nsystem of a regional commission on the ecology of Aral\r\nSea. This initiative is justified by the need to formulate and\r\nimplement a specific long-term strategy and programme for\r\nresolving the Aral crisis on the basis of the principles of\r\nsustainable development, maintaining the standard of living\r\nof the people of the region, and ensuring a decent life for\r\nfuture generations.\r\nModern Uzbekistan is in the process of establishing a\r\nState based on the rule of law, a civil society and an\r\neffective, socially oriented market economy. It has an acute\r\nneed for the experience and know-how of international\r\nbodies. At the same time, our republic is devoting great\r\nattention to the question of recruiting Uzbek experts for the\r\nactivities of a variety of United Nations bodies. Let me\r\nstress that the level of training and knowledge of Uzbek\r\nspecialists is fully in keeping with the requirements for\r\nrecruitment to the bodies and specialized agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations system. I am confident that specialists from\r\nUzbekistan can and should contribute to the work of\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress in particular that\r\nour relationship with the United Nations is intended not\r\nonly to obtain assistance and support, but primarily to\r\nenable us to play our full part in the successful\r\nimplementation of the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations and to give fresh content to the activities of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\nnext on His Excellency Mr. Domingos Augusto Ferreira,\r\nChairman of the delegation of Sao Tome and Principe.\r\nMr. Ferreira (Sao Tome and Principe): On behalf of\r\nthe people and the Government of Sao Tome and Principe,\r\nand on my own account, I congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-third session, and wish you success in carrying out\r\nyour duties.\r\nOn the occasion of the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome\r\nand Principe would like to join with all other countries of\r\nthe world in advocating the cause of development, peace\r\nand liberty for all the world’s people. We want also to state\r\nour deep concern at the grave problems which affect\r\nmankind and which pose a threat to the world.\r\nWe are one year away from the beginning of a new\r\nmillennium, and it is with sadness that we observe a\r\nworld deeply divided between North and South, rich and\r\npoor, and developed and underdeveloped countries.\r\nThe African continent continues its process of\r\nhealing and its struggle towards development. In recent\r\ndecades many countries of our continent have become\r\nindependent and democratic, and are ready for the open\r\nmarket. Some of them have experienced significant\r\neconomic growth. Economic reforms and democracy have\r\nmade them favourable ground for development.\r\nHowever, against this background, many African\r\ncountries have become poorer. Bad management and\r\nvarious types of crisis have given these countries very\r\nfew opportunities for development. In 1996, 240 million\r\nAfricans were living on less than one dollar per day.\r\nAfrica’s share of international trade was only 2 per cent,\r\nand the continent received 2 per cent of foreign\r\ninvestment. Poverty is increasing, and political instability\r\nis creating violent conflicts which are very difficult to\r\ncontrol.\r\nWith deep sadness, we observe too many armed\r\nconflicts, such as those in Sudan, Somalia, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, the Great\r\nLakes region, Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea and so on. Too\r\nmany lives have been lost; too much economic\r\ninfrastructure and too many homes have been destroyed;\r\ntoo many refugees have been created. That is the result of\r\narmed conflicts in our continent.\r\nThis situation merits the attention of all in order to\r\nprevent armed conflicts, by creating an environment for\r\ndialogue and reconciliation based on democratic\r\nprinciples, good governance and respect for the human\r\nrights of minorities.\r\nThe situation in Guinea-Bissau requires the special\r\nattention of the international community in order to\r\npromote dialogue between all the parties in conflict. We\r\nparticipated in negotiations as a member of the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, together\r\nwith the Southern African Development Community, and\r\nour mediation resulted in a ceasefire. We appeal to both\r\nparties to create a good environment to secure peace and\r\ntranquillity and restore the normal functioning of\r\ndemocratic institutions and respect for the Constitution.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nAngola is also our concern. We call on the\r\ninternational community to avoid another war in that\r\ncountry. We also appeal to UNITA and to the Government\r\nof National Unity and Reconciliation, of which UNITA is\r\na part, to fulfil all the objectives of the Lusaka Protocol and\r\nwork for peace and development.\r\nThe situation in Central Africa and the Great Lakes\r\nregion is for us the most worrying in our continent. I do not\r\nwant to exaggerate, but I can say that this subregion is in\r\nflames which can spread into other countries. Our desire is\r\nto work together with the international community and all\r\ncountries in the subregion to seek a solution. Despite all the\r\napproaches already made to end the conflict peacefully, we\r\ncannot remain inactive while the conflict is widening, with\r\ncatastrophic consequences. The international community\r\nmust continue to work for peace to stop the suffering of\r\ninnocent people.\r\nBesides the conflicts on the African continent, there\r\nare others, such as that in East Timor. The East Timorese\r\npeople have been suffering under foreign occupation. They\r\nare fighting for self-determination, the right to freely choose\r\ntheir own destiny, in accordance with the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. If we deny them those rights, we contradict\r\nthe principles of our Organization. Against this background,\r\nwe reaffirm our support for the Maubere people in their\r\nstruggle for self-determination. We appeal to the United\r\nNations and the international community to continue\r\nsupporting the negotiations to reach a peaceful end of the\r\nconflict.\r\nThe world is facing serious environmental problems.\r\nThe development of programmes to protect our planet must\r\nbe a priority, and we must work together to avoid\r\nbehaviour that damages the environment by creating\r\npollution, land degradation and destruction in general. We\r\nneed to follow the Rio Declaration if we want a safe\r\nenvironment and sound development. We have to pay\r\nspecial attention to the problems of desertification, water\r\npollution, deforestation and biological diversity.\r\nI would like to call attention to resolution 2758\r\n(XXVI), adopted in 1971, which denied over 21.8 million\r\npeople their right to international representation and totally\r\ncontravenes the principle of universality, consecrated in the\r\nCharter. The admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nas one of our own would not pose a challenge to any of the\r\nexisting Members, and the peaceful coexistence of the two\r\nsides in this Organization would be a catalyst to end one of\r\nthe largest and most enduring sources of instability in Asia.\r\nTaking into consideration this and the changes that have\r\ntaken place in international relations, we call on the\r\nGeneral Assembly to review resolution 2758 (XXVI).\r\nFifty-three years after the United Nations was\r\nfounded, I would like once again to emphasize and praise\r\nthe positive contribution this Organization has made to\r\nfreedom, development and peace. The Organization faces\r\nmore and more challenges, and it is necessary and\r\nconvenient to proceed with reform of the system to make\r\nit capable of responding to the demands upon it. The\r\nreform must also include the Security Council; it is time\r\nto reform its structure to provide a better geographical\r\nrepresentation.\r\nIt is our understanding that a more democratic,\r\nefficient and less bureaucratic United Nations may better\r\nshoulder its obligations and carry out its duties, in order\r\nto guarantee progress and universal peace.\r\nThe struggle against organized crime, drugs, money\r\nlaundering and international terrorism must be one of the\r\npriorities of the United Nations and of all countries.\r\nEverybody must contribute to fighting these problems and\r\ntheir catastrophic consequences.\r\nMy country is facing a difficult moment in its\r\nhistory. The economy of Sao Tome and Principe has been\r\nundergoing deep changes. Statistical data show that there\r\nis a significant improvement. It seems that inflation has\r\nslowed; there is an improvement in the fiscal system and\r\nthe value of the national currency has risen.\r\nThe Government has been making efforts in order to\r\nachieve satisfactory results in the area of economic\r\ndevelopment and reducing poverty. One of our concerns\r\nis related to the problem of our high foreign debt,\r\nestimated at nearly $270 million and which is 54 times\r\ngreater than the value of our exports. Despite all the\r\nefforts that have been made, these numbers are still tragic.\r\nIt is essential for Sao Tome and Principe to benefit from\r\nhaving its foreign debt forgiven. It is very important for\r\nus to be able to participate in the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative.\r\nIn closing, I would like to thank the United Nations\r\nand its specialized agencies for the support given to my\r\ncountry.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nI would like to remind members that statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for\r\nthe first intervention and to five minutes for the second\r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Yimer (Ethiopia): This morning the Assembly\r\nlistened to a statement by the Foreign Minister of Eritrea\r\ncontaining the usual litany of distortions and obfuscations\r\nregarding the current crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\r\nWe characterize them as the usual litany because they\r\nrepresent the futile attempts that the Eritrean Government\r\nmakes in various forums to cover up its aggression against\r\nEthiopia and the occupation of our territory by force.\r\nSince by virtue of the continued occupation of\r\nEthiopian territory by Eritrea the aggression against\r\nEthiopia is continuing, the Eritrean leadership is trying to\r\nshed the stigma of aggressor by trying to divert the\r\nattention of the international community from the real issue:\r\nblatant aggression by one State against another, in flagrant\r\nviolation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the\r\nbasic norms and principles of international law.\r\nIn essence, this is not at all surprising, since that is\r\nhow aggressors always behave. The represent themselves as\r\nvictims. But it is not that easy to deceive international\r\nopinion for long, because the facts speak for themselves.\r\nHowever much they may try to portray the crisis between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea as a border dispute, it is\r\nincontrovertible that the crisis stems from the aggression\r\ncommitted by Eritrea against Ethiopia on 12 May 1998. No\r\none, except possibly the Eritrean leadership itself, believes\r\notherwise, and they know it.\r\nIn his statement, the Eritrean Foreign Minister claims\r\nthat his country believes that all inter-State disputes should\r\nbe settled by peaceful means and without the use of force,\r\nand that this has always underscored his country’s relations\r\nwith its neighbours. This has never been valid over the past\r\nseven years. There have been four victims, in effect all of\r\nEritrea’s neighbours, including, most recently, Ethiopia,\r\nwhich have been the victims of Eritrea’s aggressive attitude\r\nover the past seven years of its existence as a State.\r\nIn view of this stark fact, it is the height of arrogance\r\nand an insult to the intelligence of the international\r\ncommunity, in particular the victims of Eritrean aggression,\r\nto say that Eritrea is committed to the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes between States. On the contrary, what Eritrea\r\nis committed to is the use of force for the settlement of\r\ndisputes between States.\r\nSecondly, the Minister stated that Eritrea was\r\nsurprised and disturbed by the eruption of conflict with\r\nEthiopia. Again, this is a peculiar form of surprise by an\r\naggressor which has committed aggression following\r\ndeliberate planning and preparation.\r\nThirdly, the Eritrean Foreign Minister claims that the\r\nattack by Ethiopia against Eritrea in the Badma region on\r\n6 May is the root cause of the dispute. This is a most\r\nsurprising claim in view of the fact that the basic element\r\nof the proposal by the facilitators — the United States\r\nand Rwanda — and the specific initial requirement for the\r\nproposal to be set in motion is that Eritrean troops should\r\nleave Ethiopian territory and be redeployed to the position\r\nthey held before 6 May 1998, and that Ethiopian civil\r\nadministration should first be restored to the area.\r\nNo third party has ever even hinted that Ethiopia has\r\nattacked Eritrea at any time. The Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) Committee of Ambassadors, in its report\r\nwhich was presented to the two Governments, has, over\r\nand above stating clearly that is has reached the\r\nconclusion that Badma and its environs were under\r\nEthiopian administration before 12 May 1998, also stated\r\nthat what happened between 6 and 12 May 1998\r\nconstituted a fundamental element of the crisis.\r\nFourthly, the Eritrean Minister in his statement\r\nrepeatedly denied that Eritrean troops had crossed\r\ninternationally recognized borders between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea. In this assertion he is trying to deny the\r\nundeniable: that Eritrean troops crossed the international\r\nboundary between Ethiopia, and that it has been\r\nestablished by third parties — by the facilitators, when\r\nthey called for the deployment of Eritrean troops to the\r\nposition they held before 6 May 1998; by the OAU\r\nSummit, in supporting the facilitators’ proposal and\r\ncalling for its implementation; by the Security Council, in\r\nsupporting the OAU decision; and by the OAU\r\nCommittee of Ambassadors — that Badma and its\r\nenvirons, now under Eritrean forcible occupation, were\r\nunder Ethiopian administration before 12 May 1998.\r\nFifthly, the Eritrean Minister accuses Ethiopia of\r\nportraying Eritrea as a warmongering nation. But its\r\nbehaviour has given them that identity, not any\r\npropaganda campaign by Ethiopia. No other\r\ncharacterization would be suitable to Eritrea’s belligerent\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nattitude towards its neighbours over the past several years.\r\nThe claims that Ethiopia has designs on the Eritrean port of\r\nAssab is such an unadulterated fabrication that we will not\r\ndignify it by any reply.\r\nSixthly, the Eritrean Minister has made the claim that\r\nEthiopia has rejected all overtures by third parties for the\r\npeaceful resolution of the dispute. In this connection, the\r\nthird parties will be even more surprised than the Ethiopia\r\nGovernment by this twisting of the truth. It is common\r\nknowledge that at every step of the way, Ethiopia has\r\nofficially and formally accepted third-party proposals —\r\nsuch as those of the facilitators, the United States and\r\nRwanda; the decision of the OAU; and the resolution of the\r\nSecurity Council — while Eritrea resorted to its usual\r\nprevarication, amounting to a rejection of the proposals.\r\nWith regard to the humanitarian consequences of\r\nEritrean aggression against Ethiopia, that aggression has\r\nresulted in the displacement of over 200,000 Ethiopians\r\nfrom the areas adjoining the Ethiopian territory invaded by\r\nEritrea. Those remaining under Eritrean occupation are\r\nsuffering under the inhuman treatment of the Eritrean\r\nregime, ranging from outright physical torture to the\r\nforcible imposition of Eritrean nationality on pain of losing\r\nthe right to farm their plots of land. There was, of course,\r\nthe bombardment with napalm by the Eritrean air force of\r\ncivilian targets, including schools, in broad daylight at\r\nMekele and Adigrat towns in northern Ethiopia, which was\r\nseen by people throughout the world.\r\nThousands of Ethiopians in Eritrea are still suffering\r\nunder the cruel treatment of the Eritrean Government,\r\nprevented from returning home and denied all means of\r\nlivelihood. They are in effect hostages in the hands of the\r\nEritrean Government. Those who have money to return\r\nhome recount harrowing stories about the treatment of their\r\ncompatriots remaining in Eritrea. The Eritrean Government\r\nhas so far expelled 24,000 Ethiopians under inhuman\r\nconditions.\r\nOn its part, the Ethiopia Government has never denied\r\nthat it has asked those Eritreans in Ethiopia who pose\r\nnational security risks to Ethiopia to leave the country. In\r\nthis connection, we have repeatedly assured the\r\ninternational community that the human rights of the\r\nindividuals concerned are fully respected and their rights to\r\ntheir properties are not in any way affected.\r\nLet me reiterate what our Foreign Minister told this\r\nbody only yesterday: that the cause of the current crisis\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea lies, among other things, in\r\nthe Eritrean leadership’s propensity for aggression against\r\nEritrea’s neighbours, in particular at the whim of a\r\ndictator. As long as this state of mind is there, one cannot\r\nsee how a peaceful resolution of the crisis, which we\r\neven at this moment fervently wish for and seek, can be\r\nreality. Yet the Eritrean Minister has the temerity to\r\nsuggest peaceful resolution without any preconditions,\r\nwith the cessation of hostilities and a ceasefire. He has in\r\nfact shrouded the nefarious act of rewarding aggression in\r\nseemingly innocuous concepts. One is not so naive as not\r\nto see through this Eritrean deception and duplicity.\r\nFor our part, we have made it clear in no uncertain\r\nterms, ever since the Eritrean aggression, that we are not\r\nprepared to go through such a charade.\r\nMr. Makonga (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\r\n(interpretation from French): Many delegations have\r\ndenounced or deplored the aggression against my country.\r\nMost have urged a quick end to hostilities. Surprisingly,\r\nonly the delegations of the aggressor countries did not\r\nwant to acknowledge what they were doing. Some used\r\nsecurity reasons to try to justify their acts, others used\r\ninternal problems.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo cannot say\r\ntoo often that Rwanda is not only the base for this\r\naggression but that, for undisclosed reasons, it supports it.\r\nThe internal problem that it continues to raise is merely\r\na false alibi intended to cover up its abuses and its desire\r\nto annex part of our territory regarded as a natural grain-\r\nproducing area.\r\nUnfortunately, since the occupation of part of Kivus\r\nthe situation has worsened to such an extent that meeting\r\nthe subsistence needs of the local people is no longer\r\nassured. This is a genuine catastrophe.\r\nPillage, plunder, rape, deportation and harassment\r\nhave become commonplace throughout the occupied\r\nterritory where the invading troops are engaged in terrible\r\nacts that run counter to the humanism of which Africa\r\nwould like to become the champion. As an example, the\r\nRwandan invaders committed an odious assassination\r\nduring a religious service. One Rwandan soldier made a\r\nname for himself in Kasika by raping the pregnant wife\r\nof the traditional chief of the village, then ripping the\r\nfoetus out of her womb and drinking its blood. How\r\nshould we classify this act?\r\nAs the Assembly will have noted, the Rwandan\r\ninvaders are not only committing every imaginable and\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nunimaginable crime against peaceful Congolese civilians,\r\nbut are bringing their tradition of ethnic hatred to my\r\ncountry. Even as I speak, in Bukavu they are hunting down\r\nHutus.\r\nThe international community should know that many\r\ncurrent Rwandan leaders — for example, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs — lived peacefully in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo for decades, taking part freely in\r\ncountry life. We did not kill or threaten these people;\r\nrather, we welcomed them and gave them refuge, not out\r\nof naivety, but because of basic humanism. And so what\r\ninterest would the Democratic Republic of the Congo have\r\nnow in persecuting the other Rwandans who live on our\r\nsoil?\r\nRwanda says on the one hand that the situation now\r\nprevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is an\r\ninternal problem; on the other hand, it claims the right to\r\nintervene at any moment in order to protect the Tutsi\r\npopulations and at the same time to secure its borders.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, given the confusion\r\ndeliberately fostered by Rwanda about this unjust war\r\nimposed on the Congo, I would like to say that there are no\r\ninternal problems in my country; rather, an act of\r\naggression is being committed against the Congolese State\r\nby neighbouring Rwanda and its ally, Uganda. What is now\r\nhappening in Bukavu and Goma is nothing more than a\r\nresult of blood lust, a thirst for vengeance, the Kigali\r\nleader’s obstinate search for every sort of subterfuge to\r\nallow the establishment of ethnic supremacy.\r\nThe Congolese people have never had such desires. By\r\nnature they are very hospitable and will never lift a finger\r\nto harm those who seek refuge in their country.\r\nThe insecurity along the border between Congo and\r\nRwanda is the work of the Rwandans alone. Since their\r\ncountry became independent they have been unable to live\r\nin ethnic harmony and have thus created an unnecessary\r\ntide of displaced persons and refugees. Unfortunately, their\r\nrefusal to integrate has had unexpected consequences for\r\nthe inhabitants of the villages along the border; furthermore,\r\nit is destabilizing Rwandan political institutions, a process\r\nmade worse by periodic massacres, to the extent that the\r\ninternational community has had to establish an\r\ninternational criminal tribunal to put an end to this\r\ngenocidal culture.\r\nThe insecurity now prevailing in the region can only\r\nbe resolved if Rwanda agrees to democratize itself by\r\nrestructuring and completely reorganizing its State organs.\r\nThis Assembly should know that one of the\r\nCongolese puppets placed in Goma by Kigali has\r\nadmitted to the foreign press the presence there of some\r\nof the Rwanda Patriotic Army troops who perpetrated the\r\naggression against the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe Rwandans’ denials have convinced no one.\r\nTherefore, there should be an end to attempts to make the\r\ninternational community believe that Rwanda is in no way\r\ninvolved in what is happening in the Congo and that it is\r\njust an internal matter. If this were so, how could the\r\npresence of Rwandan troops in Goma and Bukavu be\r\njustified? Their presence has been confirmed by local\r\ncitizens, the select ministerial commission of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, the international media\r\nand independent sources cited in my statement on 23\r\nSeptember.\r\nI do not want to dwell too long on this subject, but\r\nmy delegation hopes that the Assembly will approve the\r\naddition of an agenda item on the matter, as proposed for\r\nthe present session, and that a resolution condemning the\r\naggression will be adopted.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nResponding to the statement made this morning by the\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nand Cooperation of Equatorial Guinea, my delegation\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to reiterate that — as\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister recognized in regard to the\r\ncase he mentioned — the Government of Spain firmly\r\nrejects and unreservedly condemns all terrorist acts,\r\nwherever committed and whatever criminals may be\r\nresponsible. This firm position of my Government was\r\nexpressed most clearly a few days ago by the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Spain at the 12th meeting, during the\r\ngeneral debate, when he stated:\r\n“Terrorism constitutes a serious threat to\r\ndomestic and international security, to the\r\ndevelopment and functioning of democratic\r\ninstitutions throughout the world and to the exercise\r\nof human rights.”\r\nHe then indicated our support for strengthening the\r\nmachinery of international cooperation to combat this\r\nthreat.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nMr. Menkerios (Eritrea): The Eritrean delegation has\r\nno interest in wasting the Assembly’s valuable time by\r\nengaging in a useless polemic with a party that feels that\r\nhollow sophistry can make up for realities. We choose to\r\npresent the facts on the questions of aggression; Ethiopia’s\r\nforceful occupation of our land; its criminal violations of\r\nthe human rights of Eritreans and of Ethiopians of Eritrean\r\norigin resident in Ethiopia; the expulsions; the confiscation\r\nof property and so forth; and Eritrea’s attempts to achieve\r\na peaceful solution. These attempts have been futile because\r\nof the Ethiopian Government’s total rejection of all\r\nproposals presented by Eritrea and its sticking to its\r\nultimatum demanding Eritrean withdrawal from disputed\r\nlands.\r\nMr. Ubalijoro (Rwanda): I did not wish to take the\r\nfloor, but having heard the reply of the representative of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo I wish to put on record\r\nthe following:\r\nThe statement made this afternoon by my Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation, Mr. Anastase Gasana, was\r\nbased on pure and concrete facts. The purpose of my\r\nMinister’s statement was to describe a tragic and worrisome\r\nsituation on the ground in our region. For the umpteenth\r\ntime, the international community has been alerted.\r\nAlthough I was shocked and dismayed by the\r\nstatement of the representative of the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, I will not waste the Assembly’s time by\r\nreplying to his baseless allegations and fabrications. But I\r\nwould like to state that I am glad that he was not in a\r\nposition to refute or deny the content of my Minister’s\r\nstatement when he referred to the incitation to ethnic hatred\r\nand genocide by the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nauthorities. Indeed, my Minister used quotations simply\r\nbecause he was making reference to factual events that\r\nhave generated untold tragedy in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo.\r\nIn order to demonstrate how we attach the utmost\r\nimportance to facts, I wish to read an excerpt from an\r\narticle contained in today’s International Herald Tribune,\r\nentitled “The Most Dangerous Thing in Kinshasa Is to Be,\r\nor Resemble, a Tutsi”.\r\nIt reads:\r\n“Kinshasa television broadcast interviews\r\nwith residents vowing to throw Tutsi out of the\r\ncity. An official radio station in the eastern town\r\nof Bunia on Aug. 8 urged Congolese to attack\r\nTutsi, whom it described physically: Dear\r\nlisteners! ... Open your eyes wide. Those of\r\nyou who live along the road, jump on the\r\npeople with long noses, who are tall and slim\r\nand want to dominate us.\u0027\r\n“Mr. Kabila, who lacks an effective army,\r\ndeclared Aug. 25 that all Congolese should\r\ntake up arms, even traditional weapons —\r\nbows and arrows, spears and other things\u0027 to\r\ncrush the enemy because otherwise we are\r\ngoing to become the slaves of these Tutsi\r\npeople.\u0027\r\n“Congo’s most prominent human rights-\r\ngroup — the African Association for Defense\r\nof Human Rights, which operates clandestinely\r\nsince the government banned it in April — said\r\nthe government abusively exploited patriotic\r\nfeelings to incite the population to blind acts of\r\nviolence against anyone suspected of being a\r\nrebel, a Tutsi or connected even remotely with\r\nthe rebellion.\u0027”\r\nOn this note, I wish to conclude and leave members\r\nto assess the genocidal character of the Kabila regime.\r\nMr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): For the record, my\r\ndelegation would like to exercise its right of reply in\r\nresponse to the references to East Timor made by the\r\nChargé d’affaires of Sao Tome and Principe in the\r\nGeneral Assembly in his statement this afternoon.\r\nIndonesia’s principled position regarding the\r\ndecolonization of East Timor is clear. The historical and\r\nirrefutable fact is that the East Timorese people have\r\nalready democratically exercised their right to self-\r\ndetermination. This they did by choosing independence\r\nthrough integration with the Republic of Indonesia in\r\naccordance with resolution 1514 (XV) and Principles VI,\r\nVIII and IX of resolution 1541 (XV), as further\r\nconfirmed by the relevant provisions of resolution 2625\r\n(XXV). The United Nations was kept fully informed of\r\nevery step in this process.\r\nIndonesia has consistently demonstrated its good\r\nfaith and sincerity to cooperate with the efforts of the\r\noffice of the Secretary-General and engage in a tripartite\r\ndialogue with Portugal, held under the auspices of the\r\nSecretary-General since 1982, in the search for a just,\r\ncomprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to\r\nthe question of East Timor. Towards this end, Indonesia\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nhas proposed to grant a special status to East Timor with\r\nwide-ranging autonomy in the context, and as part, of a\r\nsettlement, and has expressed its readiness to negotiate the\r\nsubstantive elements of this proposal.\r\nThis proposal reflects the reaffirmation of Indonesia’s\r\nsincere commitment to resolving the issue of East Timor.\r\nHence, as noted in the Secretary-General’s progress report\r\n(A/53/349) on the question of East Timor dated 10\r\nSeptember 1998, within the context of a tripartite dialogue\r\nthe negotiations have moved in a new direction recently,\r\nbringing new promise for an early settlement of the\r\nproblem. It is our expectation that this progress will be\r\nsustained.\r\nIt is therefore a source of profound regret that the\r\nrepresentative of Sao Tome and Principe chose, unlike other\r\ndelegations that have spoken on the subject, to ignore these\r\nirrefutable facts and spoke against the positive atmosphere\r\nwhich has recently been created.\r\nFinally, Indonesia remains fully committed to the\r\npeople of East Timor and to supporting them in their hopes\r\nand aspirations to build a better and more stable future for\r\ntheir children and themselves as Indonesian citizens.\r\nMr. Yimer (Ethiopia): The fact that the Eritrean\r\ndelegation has not chosen to waste the Assembly’s time in\r\ntrying to reply to my statement is to be appreciated.\r\nAccordingly, I stand by my earlier statement.\r\nMr. Makonga (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\r\n(interpretation from French): I just want to say one word\r\nto my young brother, the representative of Rwanda. It is\r\ndifficult for honest people of integrity to understand the lies\r\nor explain the hallucinations of Rwandan neighbours who\r\nwould besiege the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nmake it an integral part of their territory. I do not want to\r\nget into a futile argument with him. Let Rwanda withdraw\r\nfrom the Democratic Republic of the Congo instead of\r\npersisting in its nonsensical actions, which will not pay off\r\nin the long run. The truth is more rewarding than a lie.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): No other\r\ndelegations wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nBefore closing the meeting, I would like, as President\r\nto make a statement.\r\nWith the comments of the last speaker, the general\r\ndebate at the fifty-third session has drawn to a close. I\r\nbelieve that all representatives will agree that the statements\r\nwe have heard over the past two weeks have been\r\nextremely interesting and have confirmed that although\r\nthis exercise has been repeated annually for more than\r\nfive decades it has by no means become routine, due to\r\nthe growing dynamism of the subjects discussed.\r\nIt is therefore impossible for our Governments to\r\nmaintain a static vision of the complex international\r\nrealities considered in all their dimensions. The\r\nperception, recognition and better understanding of these\r\nnew realities, as well as existing ones, are such as to\r\nensure that the content of our debates is constantly\r\nrenewed and that they provide a process of mutual\r\nenrichment, from which we all benefit. I must therefore\r\nthank all those who have participated.\r\nPersonally, I believe that this debate has provided us\r\nwith a unique and invaluable opportunity to see how the\r\nGovernments of Member States view the world in these\r\nfinal years of the century; what problems, in the view of\r\ntheir leaders, have an impact on the peace, security and\r\nprosperity of peoples; and what direction the international\r\ncommunity should take in order to address and resolve\r\nthese issues.\r\nThis time, 26 heads of State, one Vice-President, one\r\nCrown Prince, 15 Prime Ministers, 14 Deputy Prime\r\nMinisters and Ministers for Foreign Affairs, 105 Foreign\r\nMinisters, six Ministers from other departments or\r\nsecretariats, 11 heads of delegations and one Observer —\r\nin total, 180 speakers — took part in the debate. Thus,\r\nthe Assembly received an exhaustive overview of the\r\nsituation. It is, of course, not my intention at this time,\r\nnor would it be within my power, to draw any\r\nconclusions. That is not my responsibility and this is not\r\nthe time to do so. However, I should at least like to share\r\nsome thoughts which the statements made over the past\r\ntwo weeks have brought to mind.\r\nIn nearly every statement made during the debate\r\nthat has concluded this afternoon, we find expressed —\r\nexplicitly or implicitly, emphatically and less so — a\r\nconcern among Governments over the profound economic\r\ninequalities between, on the one hand, the vast sectors of\r\nhumanity mired in poverty or an insufficiency of\r\nresources and, on the other, the minority living in\r\nprosperity and abundance. It is within that context that\r\nmany statements revealed and stressed the concern that\r\nthe rapid and inexorable process of globalization, which\r\nis reaching into all aspects of international relations, may\r\nalso be the natural result of scientific and technological\r\ndevelopment. There is mounting interest in securing a\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\ndeeper understanding of the nature of the process so that\r\nthe international community can prepare itself to manage its\r\neffects, work on its causes and ensure that the globalization\r\nof the economy does not benefit a mere few while harming\r\nthe weakest and most vulnerable.\r\nWe have heard calls for a definition of new rules to\r\nregulate this contemporary financial phenomenon, which\r\nhas a natural effect on commercial trade, and to promote a\r\nre-examination, revision and possibly an adjustment of the\r\nexisting structures of the financial system that emerged\r\nfrom the Bretton Woods agreements. Those structures date\r\nback to over 50 years ago — when, as was recalled by one\r\nhead of State, there were no computers — and the\r\nagreements do not seem to meet present needs.\r\nTo be fair, however, it is also useful to recognize, as\r\nif that were not enough, that the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization produces assets and liabilities. While it\r\ninspires feelings of unease and distrust among some, it\r\nappears to have heightened the need for us to work\r\ntogether. Global problems call for a global response. That\r\ninescapable truth is now, more than ever before, clearly and\r\nurgently understood, as was demonstrated by the convening\r\nof a high-level dialogue on globalization in this Hall just a\r\nfew days ago.\r\nOn a different level, the general debate has enabled us\r\nto review situations which threaten or effectively undermine\r\ninternational peace and security in various regions of the\r\nworld: Africa, Asia and Europe. Unfortunately, such\r\nsituations are many and painful; they involve dozens of\r\ncountries and millions of people, leaving in their wake\r\ndeath, destruction and refugees ousted from their homes. I\r\nsensed in a number of statements a feeling of frustration, if\r\nnot powerlessness, at the Organization’s limited ability —\r\ndue to the scant resources at its disposal — to take the\r\nnecessary preventive action to anticipate these actions and\r\nevents, much less to cope after the fact with their impact\r\nand repercussions. In any case, we must not lose sight of\r\nthe fact that there is renewed confidence, expressed in most\r\nstatements, that the United Nations should pursue its\r\nefforts.\r\nThe Organization’s difficulties in taking rapid,\r\neffective action in some cases to avoid breaches of the\r\npeace or to restore peace inevitably compel us to focus on\r\nconflict-prevention mechanisms. Many delegations referred\r\nto the need to strengthen the mechanisms that allow the\r\nUnited Nations to play its preventive role more effectively.\r\nA few days from now, the General Assembly will\r\nhave an opportunity to make a valuable contribution in\r\nthis regard when it considers the topic of the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa, on which the\r\nSecretary-General has produced an excellent report, for\r\nwhich I thank him.\r\nThe peoples of several regions of Africa are\r\ncurrently enduring unspeakable privations as a result, in\r\nsome cases, of natural disaster and, in others, of serious\r\ninternal and inter-State conflicts. Sometimes, both\r\nphenomena are at cause. It is clear from all the statements\r\nmade in the general debate that the Assembly wishes to\r\ndevote special and priority attention to the situation in\r\nAfrica. I hope that the Assembly will be able to consider\r\nthe issue in depth on a priority basis and that it will\r\nsucceed in determining how the United Nations might\r\nprovide the sister African countries with rapid, effective\r\nassistance in overcoming these extreme situations, which\r\nhave touched us all.\r\nThis debate has also shown that the international\r\ncommunity is becoming increasingly impatient and\r\nsometimes dissatisfied with the lack of progress in the\r\nsearch for solutions to other conflicts whose prolongation\r\nposes a serious threat to peace and security. Some of\r\nthese conflicts are included in our agenda and I hope that\r\nwe will be able to adopt targeted, substantive and\r\nmeaningful resolutions on them that can be effectively\r\nimplemented.\r\nIn this regard, we have seen some encouraging signs.\r\nI am referring in particular to the statements made by the\r\nrepresentatives of Israel and Palestine in the course of the\r\ngeneral debate confirming their desire to conclude the\r\npeace process and their willingness to resume negotiations\r\nthat will lead to a positive conclusion of this long-\r\nstanding conflict.\r\nThe debate has inevitably revealed that there is still\r\nprofound, widespread concern at the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Numerous references were\r\nmade to the events of this year that proved that this\r\nconcern was fully justified. That has prompted many\r\nrepresentatives to urge countries that have not yet done so\r\nto join non-proliferation regimes. Accordingly, we must\r\nfind the ways to promote strengthening of the institutional\r\nlegal framework needed to put an end to the arms race,\r\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear testing.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nFortunately, in the course of the debate we also\r\nreceived encouraging signals from countries deeply\r\ninvolved in that matter, by way of their pledges to accede\r\nto the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). In\r\nthis context, I must mention the imminent entry into force\r\nof the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction. We must vigorously\r\npromote universal accession to the Convention in order to\r\nensure the complete elimination of those lethal, cowardly\r\nand impersonal devices.\r\nThe problem of terrorism has been another of the\r\ntopics most singled out by speakers. On the basis of the\r\nnumerous references made to the issue in the general\r\ndebate, it can easily be concluded that Governments hope\r\nthat the United Nations will deepen and continue the battle\r\nagainst terrorism by expanding the legal framework\r\ncombating and suppressing it. It is also hoped that progress\r\nwill be made in achieving the priority goal of reducing\r\norganized crime, particularly illicit drug-trafficking and the\r\nmore subtle forms of international crime, such as the illicit\r\ntrafficking in persons. I trust that we can reach agreements\r\non these topics that will show the desire to make genuine\r\nprogress in our work, and that our work will have a direct\r\nrelationship with those on whose behalf it is done.\r\nThe participants in the general debate have borne in\r\nmind and have rightly recalled that this year marks the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This is undoubtedly an\r\noccasion worth commemorating. It is also an occasion for\r\nsubstantive reaffirmation, for renewing a commitment that\r\ndoes not end with a mere instrument but extends to the real\r\nconduct of those who govern and those who are governed.\r\nThe internationalization of the protection and guarantees of\r\nhuman rights is undoubtedly an ongoing process that in\r\nrecent years has reached a significant stage, even a sort of\r\nculmination in the establishment of standing international\r\ntribunals for the prosecution and punishment of perpetrators\r\nof grave human rights violations and other serious crimes.\r\nThese circumstances, however, cannot conceal the fact\r\nthat vast segments of humanity continue to suffer violations\r\nof their rights. It is the duty of our Organization, and this\r\nAssembly in particular, to continue the effort to complete\r\nthe institutional legal framework on which the system of\r\nprotection of these rights is based. The adoption of the draft\r\ndeclaration on human rights defenders, which we hope will\r\nbe by consensus, will be the best tribute that the Assembly\r\ncould offer on the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nWe also have the realistic hope that we can adopt\r\nsignificant decisions on the strengthening of humanitarian\r\nassistance and disaster relief, on the protection of the\r\nrights of women and children, who are very often the\r\nmost vulnerable sectors of the population, and especially\r\non children in armed conflicts.\r\nThroughout the debate many references have been\r\nmade to the United Nations as being the most appropriate,\r\nthough not only, tool for confronting these and other\r\nproblems and challenges. It is clearly evident, however,\r\nthat this tool, not only because of the passage of time but\r\nalso because of the transformation of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole, must be refined and honed in\r\norder to adapt it to new times, new expectations and new\r\ndemands of the international community.\r\nThus, the topic of the reform of United Nations\r\nprocedures of the Charter has been a constant and\r\nrecurring theme of the statements we have heard. We\r\nhave all been made more aware of the difficulties\r\ninvolved in carrying out an immediate, deep-going\r\ntransformation. This will be possible only if preceded by\r\na careful intellectual process imbued with deep political\r\nthought; only if carried out with care in and a spirit of\r\ncooperation; only if time is not the deciding factor, but a\r\nfactor that must be taken into consideration in keeping\r\nwith the urgency of the need, the strength of the solution\r\nand the necessary worldwide scope. Therefore, I trust that\r\nwhen the moment comes to resume negotiations, we will\r\nbe able, with the participation of all at this fifty-third\r\nsession, to reach basic agreements leading to a definitive\r\nsolution. We know it will not be easy, but precisely for\r\nthat reason we must not delay.\r\nNaturally, efforts to strengthen the functioning and\r\ninstitutional structure of the Organization to increase its\r\nefficiency will be futile if its economic situation remains\r\npermanently precarious, if it is always in financial crisis.\r\nThis debate has again shown that the Organization will be\r\nunable to accomplish its tasks fully if it does not receive\r\nthe necessary economic resources.\r\nIt is impossible in these brief remarks to reflect the\r\nrichness of ideas and the profundity of the debate and\r\ninitiatives presented during the general debate.\r\nI have allowed myself to make these brief and\r\nnecessarily incomplete summaries, it is to remind the\r\nAssembly that the task before us in the coming weeks is\r\na formidable one, a considerable responsibility that must\r\nbe added to our individual responsibilities. I trust that\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 26th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 October 1998\r\nintelligence, dedication and our collective spirit of\r\nresponsibility will make this task possible. I have been\r\nconvinced, from the moment I assumed the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at this fifty-third session, that there\r\nexists in the General Assembly a spirit of progress, a\r\nconstructive spirit; even amid the misunderstandings and\r\nthe diversity, there exists an urgent will to overcome\r\ndifferences and disagreements. We must not allow\r\nourselves to be the ones who fail to meet expectations.\r\nLet us work so that our final statement at the close of the\r\nfifty-third session will not be a confession of frustration\r\nbut an encouraging voice of hope.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 9?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
