(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/1)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nMembers will recall that the Secretary-General presented\r\nhis report at the 7th plenary meeting, on 21 September.\r\nMr. Ramaker (Netherlands): In his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization, the Secretary-General does not\r\nonly provide us with a frank account of the failures and\r\nsuccesses of the United Nations in confronting questions of\r\nconflict, peace and development; his report is also a\r\ncatalogue of sensible suggestions to tackle these issues\r\nmore effectively in the future.\r\nThe Secretary-General outlines a vision of how in the\r\nfuture the Organization should deal with the complexities\r\nof a community of increasingly independent States. Its\r\ncentrepiece is his assumption that the United Nations should\r\nplay a vital role in this global process of change. We could\r\nnot agree more, and look forward to the proposals the\r\nSecretary-General intends to submit in this regard to the\r\nMillennium Assembly.\r\nFor our part, we are ready to contribute to a strong\r\nand effective Organization that can lead us well prepared\r\ninto the next century.\r\nWe welcome the strong case that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral makes for focusing international efforts on the\r\nprevention of conflict. After all, pursuing the post facto\r\nsolution of conflicts, which has been the practice so far,\r\nis much more costly in terms of both human suffering and\r\nmaterial losses.\r\nSuch a preventive policy is an ambitious\r\nundertaking. It requires a broad approach, integrating\r\npolitical and security instruments with longer-term\r\ndevelopment and medium-term reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation activities as well as short-term relief\r\nemergency assistance.\r\nWith the Secretary-General, we believe that the\r\nSecurity Council can play a pivotal role in such a\r\ncomprehensive strategy. It would require the Council not\r\nonly to pay systematic attention to the political and\r\nmilitary aspects of crises. It would also have to address\r\nall those formidable threats to human security beyond\r\nnaked violence and aggression. Poverty, ethnic tensions\r\nand natural disasters equally threaten the human\r\nenvironment as root causes of many conflicts.\r\nIn this context, the Secretary-General’s reference to\r\nthe potential of Article 65 of the Charter allowing the\r\nSecurity Council to request information and assistance\r\nfrom the Economic and Social Council is an interesting\r\none and should be pursued or further explored.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report is a strong antidote\r\nto complacency among Member States with regard to the\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nchallenges of development. We fully share the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s concern that, while a large proportion of\r\nhumanity still faces miserable living conditions, the flow of\r\naid to developing countries continues to decline. Equally\r\ndisconcerting is the increasing tendency among donors to\r\nearmark aid and ignore the real needs of recipients.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I can only assure the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that my country will stick to its self-imposed aid\r\ntarget of 0.8 per cent of its gross domestic product.\r\nMy country firmly believes in the value of multilateral\r\ndevelopment channels. They, as it were, guarantee a —\r\nbalanced distribution of aid. We can, therefore,\r\nwholeheartedly subscribe to the Secretary-General’s claim\r\nthat the United Nations does have an added value as a truly\r\nuniversal development institution.\r\nConsequently, the Netherlands intends to increase its\r\ncontribution to multilateral development cooperation. The\r\ndecision to do this, I freely admit, has also been inspired by\r\nthe reforms and innovations that the Secretary-General has\r\ninitiated in the domain of United Nations development\r\nactivities.\r\nHowever, we harbour no illusions that even generous\r\naid could be the sole vehicle for social and economic\r\nchange. On the contrary, the most important contribution in\r\nthis regard consists of national resources and financial\r\nmeans. In our view, development strategies should\r\nprimarily focus on maximizing the impact of sound national\r\npolicies and good governance, leading to sustainable\r\ndevelopment and favourable conditions for attracting private\r\ninvestment.\r\nIn the humanitarian field, we welcome the\r\nreorganization of the Secretariat resulting in the\r\nestablishment of the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs. Under the skilful leadership of the\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, the\r\nUnited Nations system is steadily refining and improving its\r\ncapacity to respond whenever and wherever man-made or\r\nnatural disasters strike.\r\nMaybe this is the moment and the place to recall the\r\ndebate a few days ago in the Security Council on protection\r\nfor humanitarian workers. It is indeed essential that such\r\nprotection be provided for staff who often have to work in\r\nextremely dangerous situations.\r\nIt is, of course, no coincidence that during the general\r\ndebate that took place in his Hall over the previous two\r\nweeks almost all heads of State, heads of Government\r\nand heads of delegation addressed the issue of\r\nglobalization. After all, in his report the Secretary-General\r\ngave us some compelling reasons to engage in an ongoing\r\ndiscussion on how to deal with this phenomenon, which\r\naffects all of us in one way or another.\r\nIndeed, this subject has now been put firmly on the\r\nUnited Nations agenda. It is important that all organs of\r\nthe United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, which are at this very moment meeting in\r\nWashington, develop a joint approach towards the\r\nconsequences of this process by sharing information and\r\nanalyses and by pursuing consistency and\r\ncomplementarity in their policies. The immediate negative\r\nconsequences — marginalization of social groups and of\r\nleast developed countries — require our special attention.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly stresses that the\r\npromotion of human rights should not be treated as\r\nsomething separate from the Organization’s other\r\nactivities. He qualifies this as a common thread running\r\nthrough all of those activities. We support this view. Fifty\r\nyears after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, it has become more and more clear that a\r\nhuman rights policy cannot stop at standard-setting and\r\ndeclaratory statements: it must encompass early warning,\r\nprevention and remedying of human rights violations.\r\nOnly an integrated policy in the fields of peace and\r\nsecurity, development and human rights can yield results.\r\nFor that reason, we will continue to contribute to the\r\nimplementation of this approach, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has so eloquently outlined in his report.\r\nAt the same time, it must be clear that within these\r\nintegrated policies the international legal system itself has\r\nto be accorded its proper weight. We share the optimism\r\nof the Secretary-General about the increasing awareness\r\nof the need to base the international order on legal norms\r\nand rules. The International Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia in The Hague and the International Tribunal\r\nfor Rwanda have been contributing, within their\r\nmandates, to the noble efforts to end a global culture of\r\nimpunity. We trust that the International Criminal Court\r\nin due course will play a similar role.\r\nIn our view, the United Nations, in a number of\r\nsignificant ways, is quite on track with the reforms that\r\nthe Secretary-General initiated last year. Indeed, much has\r\nalready been achieved, and we agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations family is today acting\r\nwith greater unity of purpose and coherence of effort than\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nit did only a year ago. We are convinced that, given this\r\nprogress, the United Nations family and Member States\r\nalike will support reform as an ongoing process enabling\r\nmankind, at any given point in time, to deal effectively with\r\nevolving global issues.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I wish to thank the Secretary-General for the\r\nthoughts set out in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization during the period of the fifty-second session\r\nof the General Assembly. We share his vision of the role of\r\nthe United Nations for the twenty-first century. Ours will be\r\na globalized and interdependent world.\r\nSince the mid-1990s, globalization has been the engine\r\nof economic dynamism, of the liberalization of markets, of\r\nincreased flows of investment and of the communications\r\nrevolution. Developing countries have carried out profound\r\nreforms so that they could be integrated into this new state\r\nof affairs. We agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\nchallenge we face is not to resist globalization, but to take\r\nadvantage of its positive effects and neutralize its adverse\r\nconsequences.\r\nFacts show that the economic prosperity of recent\r\nyears exists side by side with extreme poverty. One fifth of\r\nhumanity must live on just one dollar a day. Yet the total\r\nvolume of official development assistance has been\r\nconstantly decreasing.\r\nBecause of its universal nature and its broad\r\neconomic, social and political mandate, the United Nations\r\nhas the capacity and legitimacy to propose action that\r\nwould make it possible for globalization to benefit everyone\r\nand to encompass countries and societies that have\r\nremained on the fringes of the process. We therefore value\r\nthe development assistance provided by United Nations\r\nfunds and programmes to eradicate poverty and to promote\r\nsocial development, sustainable development, good\r\ngovernance and the rights of women.\r\nInstitutional reform within the United Nations should\r\nmake it possible to take action on the new realities\r\nengendered by globalization. In our view, that is the central\r\nidea of the report of the Secretary-General, and we entirely\r\nagree with it. The United Nations must be the voice of the\r\nmajority, the voice of the smallest and weakest — who in\r\nan unregulated world seem to have no agenda that\r\nrepresents their interests.\r\nAmong today’s global problems, environmental\r\ndegradation in its various forms requires an urgent response\r\nfrom Governments and from civil society. Argentina\r\nunderstands this challenge and is convinced that isolated\r\nactions are inadequate to address global problems such as\r\nclimate change. We welcome the adoption of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change, and we are proud that from 2 to 13\r\nNovember Argentina will shall host the fourth session of\r\nthe Conference of the Parties to that Convention.\r\nIn a globalized, interdependent world, the protection\r\nand promotion of human rights is an inseparable element\r\nof international peace and security. Extreme poverty and\r\ncivil conflicts sometimes make us lose sight of individual\r\nfreedoms. That is why the promotion of human rights\r\nmust not be viewed in isolation from the other activities\r\nof the United Nations, but rather as an element common\r\nto all of them, in particular to conflict-prevention and the\r\nconsolidation of peace and development.\r\nJust as we share the common task of promoting and\r\nprotecting human rights, we must also take determined\r\naction against drug-trafficking and terrorism. The special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on the drug problem and\r\nthe adoption of the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings are concrete examples\r\nof joint action to deal with global threats. We also see\r\nsuch joint action in the sphere of humanitarian assistance:\r\nsince its establishment, the “white helmets” initiative has\r\nsought to create awareness in the international community\r\nof the need for joint action. It is disgraceful that this spirit\r\nof solidarity should be frustrated when needy people are\r\nprevented from receiving humanitarian assistance and\r\nwhen there are attacks against international personnel\r\nresponsible for distributing that assistance.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\r\nis the irreplaceable role of the United Nations. If that\r\nresponsibility is not shouldered, no other activities can be\r\ncarried out effectively. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that along with conflicts between States, natural\r\ndisasters, ethnic tension, systematic violations of human\r\nrights and grave humanitarian emergencies are all sure\r\nsources of instability that can disrupt peace and security\r\nthroughout a region.\r\nThese conflicts require of the Security Council a\r\nnew sensitivity, which can be produced only by a more\r\ndirect awareness of the realities of the countries\r\nconcerned and of the political, social, economic and\r\nhumanitarian circumstances where those conflicts are\r\ntaking place. There is thus a need for greater transparency\r\nin the work of the Council, closer contact with the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nGeneral Assembly and a frank dialogue with the parties to\r\nconflicts and with troop-contributing countries. In this\r\nconnection, we must consider in detail the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal to establish cooperation between the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council on\r\nthe basis of Article 65 of the Charter.\r\nDisarmament plays a central role in the area of peace\r\nand security. We share the Secretary-General’s concern\r\nregarding recent nuclear tests. At the same time, we view\r\nhopefully the declarations made by India and Pakistan with\r\nregard to signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty. I am pleased to announce that on 24 September our\r\nCongress approved that Treaty, which will soon be ratified.\r\nAnother positive development is the adoption in\r\nOttawa of the Convention banning anti-personnel mines,\r\nwhich Argentina signed in December 1997.\r\nArgentina also supports the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones as a means to achieve the gradual\r\ndenuclearization of the planet, and resolutely supports the\r\ninitiative aimed at declaring the southern hemisphere an\r\narea free of nuclear weapons.\r\nWith regard to the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR), plus Bolivia and Chile it is worth\r\nmentioning, the Inter-American Convention against the\r\nIllicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms,\r\nAmmunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials and\r\nthe Ushuaia Declaration, which establishes a zone free of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and which contains a decision\r\nto move towards declaring the MERCOSUR region an area\r\nfree of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nIn his annual report the Secretary-General emphasizes\r\nthe fact that the number of United Nations personnel\r\nassigned to peacekeeping operations has decreased since\r\n1990. Nevertheless, this does not mean that we live in a\r\nsafer world. Peacekeeping structures must always be\r\navailable for unforeseen deployments. We believe that the\r\nlack of financial resources must not restrict this principal\r\nmandate of our Organization.\r\nArgentina, which is the eighth largest troop-\r\ncontributing country and this year is celebrating the fortieth\r\nanniversary of its participation in peacekeeping operations,\r\nonce again renews its commitment to those operations.\r\nIn addition, Argentina is part of the Rapid Deployment\r\nBrigade and the stand-by arrangements system. It maintains\r\nits troops at a high level of training and offers both\r\nArgentine and foreign officers courses at its training\r\ncentre. During his recent visit to Buenos Aires the\r\nSecretary-General honoured the centre with his presence.\r\nThe system of collective security and the rule of law\r\nhave been strengthened by the recent creation of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. We completely agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s assessment regarding the\r\nimportance of civil society in the process of creating that\r\nCourt. We would like to pay special tribute to the\r\nCoalition for an International Criminal Court, which\r\nchannelled the efforts of hundreds of non-governmental\r\norganizations and promoted a permanent and fruitful\r\ndialogue with Governments.\r\nThe summary which I have just given reflects\r\nArgentina’s commitment, and that of Latin America, to\r\nthe United Nations and to the decisions adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. That commitment will be strengthened\r\nas today’s uncertainty in the international arena requires\r\na more energetic and assertive Organization for the\r\nachievement of the purposes of the Charter.\r\nMr. Pawar (India): Permit me to compliment you,\r\nMr. President, on the skill with which you are conducting\r\nthe work of the fifty-third session.\r\nMay I also thank the Secretary-General for his report\r\non the work of the Organization, which is the subject of\r\ntoday’s discussion, and compliment him on its quality. I\r\nwill address myself to only a few of the many themes\r\nwhich he has covered in this report.\r\nWe believe that all Member States must work\r\ntogether to strengthen the United Nations, make its\r\nfunctioning more democratic and representative and\r\nensure, through it, that we are able to harness for the\r\ncommon good the forces and energies released by the end\r\nof the cold war and by the momentum in global economic\r\ninteraction. It is only the United Nations that can evolve,\r\ndefine and promote a comprehensive and responsive\r\nuniversalist agenda which will meet the challenges of the\r\nnext century. The Secretariat obviously has a critical role\r\nto play. On the one hand, led with distinction by the\r\nSecretary-General, it must in its work faithfully reflect the\r\npriorities set by the Member States and transmitted\r\nthrough the intergovernmental mandates; on the other\r\nhand, it is our responsibility to give the Secretariat the\r\nresources to do the work that we have assigned it.\r\nWe applaud the Secretary-General’s vision of the\r\nOrganization, which places disarmament near the centre\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nof its mission of peace and development. However, we are\r\ndisappointed that it appears from the report that what\r\npreoccupies the United Nations is still non-proliferation and\r\nperhaps the reduction of nuclear weapons, not their total\r\nelimination. Even now, with the cold war part of history,\r\nthe international community has been unable to come to\r\ngrips with the fundamental global problem that more than\r\n35,000 of these weapons are held in the armouries of the\r\nnuclear-weapon Powers, with the rest of the world having\r\nno say in whether or not they will draw down these stocks\r\nand, if so, at what pace.\r\nWhat India wants, and what the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement wants, is not a leisurely reduction of nuclear\r\nweapons, accompanied by the upgrading and strategic\r\nmodernization of arsenals, but their elimination, not in an\r\nimpossibly distant future, but within a short time frame,\r\ninformed by a sense of urgency and political commitment.\r\nWe have stressed from this podium many times the\r\ncentrality of promoting nuclear disarmament to safeguard\r\nour collective future. We do so again. This goal should now\r\nbe within our grasp. We believe that, in accordance with\r\nthe principles and priorities of the Final Document of the\r\nfirst special session on disarmament, the United Nations has\r\nthe foremost responsibility to promote nuclear disarmament,\r\nand this should be both articulated and pursued among its\r\nhighest priorities.\r\nAs the Secretary General has noted, peacekeeping\r\ncannot but continue to be an important area of the work of\r\nthe United Nations. We agree with the report that\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\narrangements whose mandate permit them to play such a\r\nrole can be useful in peacekeeping operations. However, the\r\nUnited Nations cannot possibly either cede or subcontract\r\nits authority in peacekeeping to any lesser body, nor\r\nbecome an instrument for countries or regional\r\norganizations to promote agendas which are not those of the\r\ngeneral membership.\r\nA word on sanctions. The report welcomes the concept\r\nof smart sanctions. However, the record has shown that for\r\nmany countries eager to impose sanctions, smart sanctions\r\nare those which cause the least pain to those who impose\r\nthem and frequently cause extreme suffering to the often\r\ninnocent populations of the target countries. We have\r\nalways said that sanctions are a blunt instrument. They\r\nmust be used sparingly and after the most careful\r\nconsideration by the international community.\r\nThe report states that the United Nations has “started\r\nto embrace a new holistic concept of security” and goes on\r\nto say that, following from this, the role of the Security\r\nCouncil should also be broadened. This is a matter that\r\nrequires very careful consideration. For years, it has been\r\nwidely recognized that the security of nations, and\r\ninternational peace, has multiple dimensions. This indeed\r\nwas why, several years ago, the United Nations\r\ncommissioned studies on the linkages between\r\ndisarmament and development. But it is a completely\r\ndifferent matter to argue therefrom that as a result it is\r\nthe Security Council that should assume an expanded role.\r\nOn the contrary, this holistic concept of security can be\r\nproperly addressed only in a body like the General\r\nAssembly, with a universal membership and a general\r\nmandate.\r\nWe note with interest the reference in the report to\r\nthe “expression of global people power”, which was made\r\nmanifest in recent multilateral negotiations. The\r\nnegotiations on the Statute of the International Criminal\r\nCourt have been referred to as one of these instances,\r\nwhere individuals and groups promoted a common cause\r\n“supported by world public opinion”. Again, the United\r\nNations should tread with caution. In countries that are\r\nhome to contain two thirds of the world’s population, the\r\nnegotiations on the International Criminal Court did not\r\nraise a ripple; world public opinion was not engaged.\r\nAlso, the negotiations themselves were in many\r\nways a travesty. Delegations were subject to enormous\r\npressure from non-State actors; the freedom of\r\nGovernments to negotiate was constrained, and the\r\ndiscussions less than transparent. At a critical stage in the\r\nnegotiations, some Member States received unusual\r\ninterventions from the Secretariat. And requests from\r\nStates that represent the majority of the world’s\r\npopulation were brushed aside because they were not\r\npolitically convenient to those described as the like-\r\nminded. These are developments we would caution\r\nagainst. The Secretariat of the United Nations properly\r\nfunctions in promoting mandates given to it by the\r\ngeneral membership and not in anticipating them.\r\nWe cannot achieve a durable and just peace unless\r\nthere is a transformation of a world order which works\r\ninexorably against the interests of the poorer countries.\r\nThe Secretary-General has clearly underlined that the\r\nchallenge of development remains paramount in this\r\nworld, where one fifth of humanity is forced to fend for\r\nitself on less than a dollar a day. It is therefore saddening\r\nto observe the steady decrease in the importance of the\r\noperational activities of the United Nations, with a\r\nrelatively modest $5.5 billion being made available for\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\ndevelopment assistance through the United Nations. No real\r\nprogress has been made to fund United Nations funds and\r\nprogrammes on a secure, predictable, assured and\r\ncontinuous basis, commensurate with the increasing needs\r\nof the developing countries.\r\nIndia is one of the largest contributors to the core\r\nresources of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) and a significant contributor to those of the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF). We hope that the developed\r\ncountries will also increase their contributions to united and\r\napolitical resources for development. At the same time, the\r\nreforms undertaken by the United Nations funds and\r\nprogrammes in the context of funding strategies should\r\npreserve the essential character of United Nations\r\nassistance, which must continue to be neutral, impartial,\r\ngiven as grants and based on the priorities of recipient\r\ncountries. The United Nations development assistance\r\nframework must be approved by recipient Governments to\r\nensure that it corresponds to and reflects national priorities.\r\nWe commend the excellent work undertaken by UNDP,\r\nUNICEF, UNFPA and the World Food Programme. They\r\nshould continue to focus on their mandates, not divert their\r\nscarce resources into activities that are better conducted by\r\nother agencies of the United Nations system.\r\nIndia accords the highest importance to the provision\r\nof humanitarian assistance which fully respects the guiding\r\nprinciples laid down by the General Assembly in resolution\r\n46/182. We welcome the streamlining of the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the efforts of the\r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator to engage the Inter-Agency\r\nStanding Committee in proactive and collaborative efforts\r\nto deal with a limited number of key issues. We are\r\nconcerned, however, that the lack of predictable resources\r\nfor the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,\r\nmore than 60 per cent of whose costs are still funded from\r\nextrabudgetary resources, may curtail its effectiveness. As\r\nwe have said before, reforms cannot succeed in the absence\r\nof required resources. We are seriously concerned that the\r\nlevels of funding for humanitarian assistance have been\r\ndeclining over the last few years, both in absolute terms\r\nand as a proportion of programme requirements.\r\nIt is clear from the report of the Secretary-General that\r\nless than 25 per cent of the requirements of humanitarian\r\nassistance were actually made available by mid-July 1998.\r\nWe therefore strongly support his earlier proposal to\r\nconduct a comprehensive review of the funding of\r\nhumanitarian programmes, including, inter alia, the\r\nrelationship between funding provided for emergencies and\r\nresources made available for development programming.\r\nWe hope that consolidated reports by the Humanitarian\r\nAffairs Coordinator on the implications of under-funding,\r\nincluding forced changes in priorities and cancellation of\r\nactivities, would be an important first step in ensuring that\r\nthe United Nations can provide adequate assistance to\r\nthose in need.\r\nWe have noted the dilemmas of relief and\r\ndevelopment linkage outlined in the report. We believe\r\nthat a comprehensive approach that links relief and\r\ndevelopment is required to close the relief-to-development\r\ngap. The eradication of poverty through sustained socio-\r\neconomic development offers the best opportunity to\r\nbreak through the vicious circle of underdevelopment,\r\nconflict and misery.\r\nThere can be no doubt, during this fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, that the promotion and protection of these rights\r\nconstitute one of the core responsibilities of the United\r\nNations in its functions, both in the preservation of\r\ninternational peace and security and in the promotion of\r\ndevelopment. The emphasis and priority which the\r\nSecretary-General places on human rights in the work of\r\nthe Organization is therefore welcome. However, the\r\nreport tends to simplify the relationship between human\r\nrights and peace and security, as well as development; we\r\nwould be concerned if the United Nations were to seek\r\nsolutions and responses that rely excessively on a\r\nstrengthening only of the legal order in the promotion of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThere can be no doubt that there are situations in\r\nwhich human rights are a major cause of conflict. There\r\ncan also be no doubt that a body of legal norms, rules\r\nand laws is important for the protection of human rights.\r\nHowever, human rights seen only from this perspective\r\nbecome essentially problems of behaviour and discipline,\r\nto be rectified by the enforcement of laws, norms and\r\nstandards. Such an approach, however, ignores or\r\ndownplays the historical, sociological, ideological and\r\neconomic circumstances which govern or influence the\r\nbehaviour.\r\nAll fundamental human rights are universal. But the\r\nroots of human rights violations may vary and may not\r\nalways be amenable to legislative and enforcement\r\napproaches. For example, situations in which threats to\r\nhuman rights come from outside or beyond the\r\nGovernment, through extreme ideologies — we are aware\r\nof the worst instances of this — require a much more\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nmultifaceted approach. Similarly, human rights problems\r\nthat are in reality symptoms of underdevelopment cannot be\r\napproached simply from a legal or behaviourist angle. They\r\nmust be addressed as problems of development.\r\nThe United Nations must view all human rights —\r\ncivil, political, economic, social and cultural — as\r\nuniversal, indivisible, interdependent, interrelated and\r\nembedded in the trinity of democracy, development and\r\nhuman rights. The Organization must not, either wittingly\r\nor unknowingly, try to promote a partial concept of human\r\nrights seen as, or modelled essentially on, civil and political\r\nrights and divorced from democracy and development. This\r\ncould lead to a dichotomy between human rights and\r\ndevelopment that would be most undesirable. It could raise\r\nconcerns that the mainstreaming of human rights, especially\r\nin the sphere of the United Nations development activities,\r\ncould displace development from its central role in the\r\nwork of the United Nations. A comprehensive approach that\r\nmainstreams economic, social and cultural rights to\r\ndevelopment, not only in name but also in deed, is the\r\napproach that would be most consistent with the holistic\r\nconcept of human rights that the United Nations should aim\r\nto promote.\r\nThe United Nations has a wide charter of\r\nresponsibilities as it approaches the next millennium. The\r\nSecretary-General has proposed initiatives for us to\r\nconsider, and we look forward to constructive discussion on\r\nthem. However, as long as the United Nations is hamstrung\r\nby its ongoing financial crisis, its scope for action will be\r\nseverely curtailed.\r\nWe trust, therefore, that all Member States will\r\ndemonstrate their support for the United Nations, which all\r\nof us need now more than ever in a globalizing world, and\r\nensure that it is placed on a sound financial footing. A\r\nUnited Nations that is bankrupt or kept in chronic poverty\r\nreflects a political bankruptcy and a lack of will to back the\r\ninstitution on which our hopes must rest for our collective\r\nfuture. That is, hopefully, not a message that the\r\nOrganization wishes to send.\r\nWe commit ourselves to supporting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his continuing efforts to reform the United\r\nNations and make it more responsive to the needs of its\r\nMembers. We wish him well in his endeavours and assure\r\nhim of our constructive engagement.\r\nMr. Burleigh (United States of America): Over the\r\npast several years a quiet revolution, as Secretary-General\r\nAnnan has noted, has been taking place here at the United\r\nNations. The Secretary-General’s report on the work of\r\nthe Organization, which is before us this morning, further\r\nillustrates the many ways in which the new culture of\r\nreform is taking root throughout the United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s strong and impressive\r\nleadership for reform is building confidence, both within\r\nthe Secretariat and among Member States. A strong,\r\ninstitution-wide consensus has emerged for reform.\r\nProgress is being made in priority-setting, budget\r\ndiscipline and rationalization of structures and functions\r\nin accordance with Assembly mandates. Of course, the\r\nproof of the package’s success will be in its effective\r\nimplementation.\r\nSecretary-General Annan took an important first step\r\nin the reform effort with the appointment of Louise\r\nFrechette as Deputy Secretary-General. This new post\r\nensures that attention to reform and the ongoing strategic\r\nmanagement of Member States’ interests will continue.\r\nCabinet-style management is also improving United\r\nNations operations.\r\nIn order to ensure continued progress, the United\r\nNations will need to focus on the Organization’s\r\ncomparative advantages. The more complex the global\r\nenvironment, the more we need to prioritize and manage\r\nwhat the United Nations can best do with what it has in\r\nhand. The United States delegation shares the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s view that administration and management must\r\ncontinue to focus on creating a mission-driven and\r\nresults-oriented Organization.\r\nHowever, while the Secretary-General’s reform\r\npackage is bearing fruit, there is still significant work\r\nremaining. We advocate robust implementation of the\r\npoints highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report. This\r\nwould include time limits on new programmes and\r\nresults-based budgeting. These have been authorized by\r\nthe Assembly since 1987 in its programme planning,\r\nbudget, monitoring and evaluation rules. Their\r\nimplementation is long overdue, as is the functioning of\r\nthe recently agreed dividend-for-development account.\r\nA striking theme in the recently concluded general\r\ndebate was that of globalization, and indeed we strongly\r\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General to adapt this\r\nOrganization to a globalized society. The strengthening of\r\ncooperation and working relations within the United\r\nNations system — between the Organization and the\r\ninternational financial institutions at both Secretariat and\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nintergovernmental levels — is an excellent example. We\r\nlook forward to further initiatives in this area.\r\nLikewise, the progressive adaptation of United Nations\r\ndevelopment machinery, both in organization and in\r\nphilosophy, demonstrates the realization that if development\r\nis to be sustainable, it must encompass not only economic\r\ngrowth but also the distribution of the fruits of that growth,\r\ninvestment in human as well as capital infrastructure, good\r\ngovernance and, of course, respect for human rights. As\r\nregards adaptation, we have been impressed that the United\r\nNations has undertaken a much needed renewal of its\r\nactivities in coordinating humanitarian relief over the course\r\nof the year.\r\nAs the Assembly now considers its many agenda\r\nitems, we must keep in mind this need — that is, to\r\ncontinue to continue to adapt United Nations work so as to\r\nbetter meet today’s international realities. The\r\nOrganization’s interests in this regard will be well served\r\nby the Secretary-General’s planned report to the\r\nMillennium Assembly. Preparing for this important event\r\nby reviewing the Organization’s priorities will help ensure\r\nthat the United Nations remains relevant and vibrant for the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nCritical to this is effective oversight. We are pleased\r\nwith the progress of the Office of Internal Oversight\r\nServices. Management audits, the announcement of\r\nguidelines, in-depth evaluations, anti-fraud work,\r\nprogramme performance reporting, support for institutional\r\nreform, and follow-up reviews all show that the\r\nOrganization is going beyond merely learning lessons to\r\nactually applying them. Of course, the support and active\r\nparticipation of staff members in the reform initiatives is\r\ncritical to their success. In order to empower them more\r\neffectively we agree with the report that vital reforms in\r\npersonnel policy must still be undertaken.\r\nKey to the success of this Organization is the United\r\nNations ability to live within its resources and to use them\r\nwhere the United Nations can best offer unique assistance.\r\nAdditionally, the United Nations many stakeholders around\r\nthe world need to see the Secretariat implementing reform\r\nin ways in which it can best offer unique assistance.\r\nFinally, and perhaps most important, we agree with the\r\nSecretary-General when he notes that\r\n“Member States must engage those reforms that lie\r\nwithin their purview with greater determination and\r\nvigour.” (A/53/1, para. 236)\r\nMy Government believes that this simple truth is the\r\nirreducible bottom line to the prospect for sustained and\r\neffective reform as admirably advocated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. So, in that context we stand ready, as we have\r\nin the past, to assist the Secretary-General in all his\r\nefforts on behalf of Assembly mandates to press for\r\ngreater efficiency, accountability and results-focused\r\naccomplishments.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): Let me begin by expressing in the name of my\r\ndelegation our greatest appreciation for the excellent\r\nefforts made by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in guiding\r\nthe work of this Organization most wisely and\r\ncompetently. It is a matter which we indeed have\r\nexpected since he assumed his post. We in Kuwait wish\r\nto reiterate our full support for his efforts to highlight the\r\nleading role of the United Nations in the international\r\nplane.\r\nMy delegation has studied carefully the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report in document A/53/1, which we are\r\nconsidering today. We cannot fail to pay tribute to the\r\nmanner in which it is couched. It is comprehensive in the\r\nway it deals with the issues. It is also characterized by\r\nvision in grappling with certain international issues, not to\r\nmention courage in stating the shortcomings of the work\r\nof the United Nations in certain respects and the reasons\r\nfor such shortcomings and providing the practical\r\nsolutions, which is a matter that deserves the appreciation\r\nof the Members of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation fully supports the position of the\r\nSecretary-General to continue with the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. Kuwait has always expressed its support\r\nof the efforts of the Secretary-General in this respect. It\r\nresponded to certain measures and suggestions on his part\r\nquickly and voluntarily. We agree with him that reform\r\nshould be a continuous process and not merely a transient\r\naction. So we have to support the Secretary-General and\r\nask him to continue his meritorious efforts in the field of\r\nreform, especially as regards strengthening the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the social, economic and development\r\nareas. These issues are contained in the report we are\r\nconsidering today.\r\nFurthermore, since Kuwait belongs to the Non-\r\nAligned Movement and the Group of 77, it wishes to state\r\nits support for all the worthy observations provided by\r\nthese two groups jointly, especially on the process of\r\nreform and in particular the section regarding solving the\r\nfinancial crisis.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General has intensively\r\nfocused on the efforts of the United Nations to resolve\r\ninternational conflicts, especially those that are rife on the\r\nAfrican continent — and in Afghanistan — that have been\r\ndealt with objectively and frankly. He has paid tribute to\r\nthe success of the efforts in defusing the crisis that emerged\r\nlast February because of the problem between the United\r\nNations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and Iraq. He\r\nstressed that his role comes within preventive diplomacy,\r\nand in this respect we fully agree with him.\r\nHowever, Kuwait wishes to continue this substantive\r\npart and wishes to refer to the efforts of the United Nations\r\nand the Secretary-General on the other issues between\r\nKuwait and Iraq — that is, the two issues of the prisoners\r\nof war and the return of Kuwaiti properties and possessions\r\nthat were stolen during the period of the Iraqi occupation of\r\nKuwait. We believe that there are certain legal and\r\ntechnical reasons that impel us to clarify what has taken\r\nplace concerning these two issues. For example, the\r\nprisoners of war and return of property to Kuwait fall under\r\ncertain major issues considered at the United Nations —\r\nthat is, the General Assembly item about the consequences\r\nof the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait in 1990, and the\r\nSecurity Council item entitled “The situation between Iraq\r\nand Kuwait”.\r\nThe United Nations is concerned with the follow-up of\r\nthe above issues, especially that it now has a representative\r\nin Iraq who is following up these and other issues.\r\nFurthermore, the previous reports of the Secretary-General\r\nhad referred to the developments of the above two issues.\r\nWe in Kuwait call upon the Secretary-General to pay\r\nspecial attention to the two above-mentioned issues,\r\nespecially regarding the Kuwaiti prisoners of war. This\r\ninvolves tragedy and suffering on the part of thousands of\r\nKuwaitis who are awaiting the return of their innocent\r\nrelatives. We confirm here that this is one kind of human\r\nsuffering. According to our understanding, human suffering\r\nis one and the same whether it is the suffering of one\r\nindividual or hundreds of individuals, or whether it was a\r\nresult of sanctions or a hostage/prisoner-of-war situation\r\nand deprivation. It is one and the same suffering that should\r\nbe dealt with strictly in a human manner and in a way that\r\nconfirms the credibility of the United Nations in this\r\nrespect.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate our appreciation of\r\nthe Secretary-General for all his efforts. I wish him success\r\nin his efforts aimed at the creation of a new\r\nOrganization — an Organization capable of confronting the\r\nchallenges of the next century and of playing a leading\r\nand effective role in the international community. This is\r\nour heartfelt wish and aspiration, as it is also for the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I wish to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. It is refreshingly concise yet comprehensive\r\nin its coverage. It deserves our serious and in-depth\r\ndiscussion and consideration. Our deliberations in this\r\nparticular debate, under item 10 of the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, will provide the basis for further\r\nconsideration of specific issues later on. These\r\ndeliberations should also assist the Secretary-General and\r\nhis associates and staff in preparing for further work to be\r\ndone during the current session as well as future sessions\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nWe now stand at the threshold of a new millennium.\r\nOur consolidated efforts at the United Nations must be\r\ndirected towards ushering in an era of unprecedented\r\ninternational cooperation and equitable development.\r\nThrough our continued commitment to the Organization,\r\nwe should be able to work collectively to establish a\r\nglobal concord that is true to the letter and spirit of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation supports the Secretary-General’s plan\r\nto submit a report to the Millennium Assembly, in which\r\nhe proposed to suggest\r\n“workable objectives and institutional means for the\r\nUnited Nations to meet the challenges of human\r\nsolidarity in the years ahead”. (A/53/1, para. 3)\r\nWhile applauding the Secretary-General’s initiative to\r\ndraw upon diverse views from various levels of society,\r\nmy delegation wishes to emphasize that preparations for\r\nthe Millennium Assembly should primarily be an\r\nintergovernmental process. It is important that the\r\nSecretary-General work closely with Member States\r\nthrough an appropriate mechanism in preparing for the\r\nimportant Assembly. Similarly, Member States should\r\nbegin to prepare to ensure that the Millennium Assembly\r\nwill achieve concrete results rather than be a largely\r\ncelebratory occasion.\r\nI wish to reiterate my delegation’s commitment to\r\nthe importance of upholding Article 1 of the United\r\nNations Charter, which calls for effective collective\r\nmeasures for the prevention and removal of threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. Too often in the past,\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\ninaction and selective actions on the part of the\r\nOrganization have led to the escalation of conflicts,\r\nresulting in unnecessary human and material costs. Too\r\noften, badly needed resources have to be spent on post-\r\nconflict activities. It is important that preventive efforts be\r\nstepped up so that the Organization’s priorities can be\r\nappropriately ordered. My delegation welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts in this regard.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for his use of the\r\nservices of prominent and skilled diplomats to serve as his\r\npersonal representatives. We also support fully the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for better information-gathering\r\nand the improvement of early warning systems to monitor\r\nand respond to potential conflicts in order to enable swift\r\nand timely action on the part of Member States as well as\r\nof the Organization. Strategies have to be well coordinated.\r\nAbove all, Member States must have the political will and\r\nresources to implement such strategies.\r\nWe concur with the Secretary-General’s assertion that\r\na new holistic concept of security is necessary in further\r\nefforts at preventing conflicts. Peace and security are indeed\r\ninextricably linked to the promotion of development. The\r\nSecretary-General has presented a very important\r\nquestion — basically, that of broadening the role of the\r\nSecurity Council by invoking Article 65 of the Charter.\r\nWhile recognizing the increasing need of the Council to be\r\nprovided with accurate and relevant information to address\r\neconomic, social and humanitarian crises that threaten\r\ninternational peace and security, my delegation would like\r\nto stress that any action by the Security Council in this\r\nregard must be taken with due recognition of the proper\r\nrole and function of General Assembly. My delegation\r\nbelieves that Member States should examine thoroughly the\r\nSecretary-General’s comments with a view to studying the\r\nvarious implications.\r\nMy delegation is supportive of efforts to further\r\nintensify cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations in early warning and preventive\r\ndiplomacy. We recognize that the United Nations cannot act\r\nalone on every potential conflict. However, it is important\r\nto ensure that this Organization does not absolve itself\r\ntotally of its central and critical role in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. My delegation strongly\r\nbelieves that preventive diplomacy should be undertaken\r\nwithin the provisions of the United Nations Charter and its\r\nexpressed mandate. The question of reconciling the\r\nlegitimate concerns of the international community and\r\nrespect for the principle of sovereignty, as expressed by\r\nmany Member States on previous occasions, should also\r\nbe carefully addressed.\r\nOn the issue of peacekeeping, Malaysia wishes to\r\nreaffirm its commitment to the important role of the\r\nUnited Nations in peacekeeping efforts. Malaysia is fully\r\nsupportive of the Organization’s initiative to continue to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations capacity to respond swiftly\r\nto conflict situations. Malaysia was among the first of 77\r\nMember States to join the United Nations standby\r\narrangements system. My delegation takes note of the\r\ninitiative taken by some Member States to establish the\r\nStand-by Forces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG).\r\nHowever, we believe that, since membership of this\r\nBrigade is not open to all States Members of the United\r\nNations, it is perhaps not quite appropriate at this stage to\r\nrefer to it as the United Nations Stand-by Forces High-\r\nReadiness Brigade. Indeed, there is a need to clarify how\r\nthe United Nations intends to deploy this Brigade in the\r\ncontext of the existing United Nations standby\r\narrangements that involve other United Nations Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe subject of sanctions has continued to be of great\r\nconcern to Member States. My delegation strongly feels\r\nthat sanctions should be applied with great caution. They\r\nshould be resorted to only in cases of extreme necessity\r\nwhen other peaceful options provided for in the Charter\r\nhave been proven inadequate. Sanctions cannot be used as\r\nan instrument for promoting the narrow and national\r\ninterests of individual Member States. Sanctions, when\r\ndeemed absolutely necessary, should have specific\r\nobjectives, be clearly targeted and given specified time-\r\nframes so as to reduce humanitarian costs.\r\nMy delegation notes that some significant progress\r\nhas been made in the reform process instituted by the\r\nSecretary-General. We welcome the continuing efforts\r\naimed at the streamlining of the Secretariat, the\r\nreorganization of the work programme into four core\r\nareas and other measures aimed at improving the whole\r\nUnited Nations system. We welcome the establishment of\r\nthe Senior Management Group. Clearly, the\r\nimplementation of the important measures proposed by\r\nthe Secretary-General that require the approval of\r\nMember States will have to be monitored so as to ensure\r\na more efficient and effective United Nations, with a\r\nrenewed emphasis on economic, social and development\r\nactivities.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note the early\r\npreparation for a review conference in the year 2000 to\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nassess the implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and for a special session\r\nof the General Assembly in June 1999 to follow up on the\r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development.\r\nMalaysia will work closely with other Member States and\r\nthe relevant United Nations organs and bodies to ensure\r\nthat we all remain committed to the promotion of social\r\ndevelopment worldwide, particularly in the light of the\r\ncurrent economic crisis, which is spreading fast around the\r\nworld, threatening to further drive millions of the poor and\r\nunderprivileged towards more extreme levels of poverty and\r\ndeprivation.\r\nThe humanitarian efforts of the United Nations around\r\nthe world deserve our applause and support. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the creation of the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs. We also welcome the Organization’s\r\ninitiatives to provide early, efficient and more coordinated\r\nresponse to humanitarian situations and its efforts to\r\nimprove the delivery of humanitarian services. The question\r\nof the security and safety of humanitarian workers in\r\nconflict situations is of utmost importance and should be\r\nadequately addressed. We note the slight decrease in the\r\nnumber of refugees worldwide in 1997. Nevertheless, we\r\nthink that serious efforts should be made not only to\r\nresolve current refugee problems, but also to prevent future\r\nones.\r\nThis year, we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We will also\r\nconduct the first review of the Vienna Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action. We have to take stock of the\r\nprogress made so far in the field of human rights. There is\r\nstill evidence of double standards and selectivity being\r\napplied in the treatment of human rights. My delegation\r\ntakes note of the Secretary-General’s assessment on human\r\nrights and concurs with him that\r\n“the promotion of human rights must not be treated as\r\nsomething separate from the Organization’s other\r\nactivities”. (ibid., para. 172)\r\nHowever, we would like to emphasize that all rights should\r\nbe treated equally and in a balanced manner. Unfortunately,\r\nthe implementation of the right to development remains\r\nvery unsatisfactory. Therefore, a new spirit of cooperation\r\nneeds to be injected to reinvigorate our collective\r\ncommitment to all aspects of human rights.\r\nMy delegation shares the vision of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations should continue to give\r\npriority to disarmament issues. Malaysia is particularly\r\npleased with the reestablishment of the Department for\r\nDisarmament Affairs. The Secretary-General has\r\nappropriately warned of the danger of nuclear-weapons\r\nproliferation and the catastrophic consequences of the use\r\nof such weapons. Clearly, international efforts on nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation have suffered some\r\nserious setbacks recently. Malaysia welcomes the recent\r\nannouncement made by Pakistan and India that they will\r\nsign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)\r\nand the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) in the near future.\r\nAs regards the work of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, my delegation regrets that the Conference\r\nhas failed yet again to establish an ad hoc committee on\r\nnuclear disarmament. My delegation, however, welcomes\r\nthe establishment of the two committees in the\r\nConference on Disarmament to deal with fissile material\r\ncut-off and negative security assurances. We hope that\r\nthey will make speedy progress in their deliberations.\r\nSerious efforts should be made to strengthen the\r\nProtocol to the Biological Weapons Convention. The\r\ninternational community should be prepared to conclude\r\nnegotiations as soon as possible on a balanced protocol\r\nfor the Convention’s verification regime, taking into\r\naccount the interests of developing countries, particularly\r\nrelated to technology transfer.\r\nThe proliferation of small arms is one of the most\r\nchallenging issues confronting the international\r\ncommunity. The illicit trafficking in and widespread use\r\nof small arms have the effect of destabilizing societies.\r\nMy delegation supports the suggested holding of an\r\ninternational conference to increase public awareness on\r\nthe need to deal with the situation.\r\nThe challenge of development remains paramount.\r\nYet the volume of external aid to developing countries\r\nhas steadily declined throughout this decade. This\r\ndilemma that we face as a community of nations is\r\naccurately summed up by the Secretary-General when he\r\nsays\r\n“Our agenda is expanding, yet our resources are\r\ndeclining.” (A/53/1, para. 121)\r\nThe total development assistance made available by\r\nthe United Nations is a relatively modest $5.5 billion per\r\nyear. Nevertheless, we share the Secretary-General’s hope\r\nregarding the United Nations Development Assistance\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nFrameworks. My delegation hopes that further efforts will\r\nbe made to constantly refine the system.\r\nThe Secretary-General has spoken in his report about\r\nengaging with globalization. In the current context, it is\r\nimportant for all of us to be alert to the numerous\r\nchallenges and vast opportunities offered by globalization.\r\nThere are new dimensions of globalization which have to\r\nbe fully understood. These new dimensions can only be\r\naddressed multilaterally by the United Nations and the other\r\ninternational institutions. The task ahead is not to reverse\r\nglobalization, but to understand it better so that we can\r\nrespond more efficiently and effectively. We are now in the\r\nmidst of increasingly intense discussions as to how\r\nGovernments should respond to the contagion of economic\r\nrecession arising from chaos in the international financial\r\nsystem. The United Nations should not be left out of these\r\ndiscussions. My delegation appreciates that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is very sensitive to these developments. We will\r\nwork with him and other Member States to ensure that the\r\nOrganization can play a positive and meaningful role.\r\nMy delegation shares the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that international cooperation has a vital role to\r\nplay in arresting and reversing the potentially harmful\r\neffects of human activities on the environment. Malaysia\r\nbelieves that dialogue with the private sector should be\r\nincreased further in the joint endeavour to preserve and\r\nprotect the environment. We are pleased with the industry\r\ndialogue with the private sector, started at the Commission\r\non Sustainable Development’s sixth session and now\r\nbecoming a regular feature of the Commission.\r\nI cannot conclude this statement without again making\r\nreference to the precarious financial health of the\r\nOrganization, as I did at the last session. Obviously, there\r\nwill be no transformation of the United Nations without the\r\nnecessary financial or budgetary support of the Organization\r\nto carry out its multifaceted programmes and activities. My\r\ndelegation views with deep concern the Secretary-General’s\r\nreference to the further deteriorating financial situation of\r\nthe United Nations. There is no running away from the\r\nfundamental issue. The major contributors have to pay their\r\noverdue contributions as soon as possible and without\r\nconditions. This and other related issues must be resolved\r\nas soon as possible if the “quiet revolution”, as advocated\r\nby the Secretary-General, is to succeed.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I should\r\nlike to propose that the list of speakers for the debate on\r\nthis item be closed at noon today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\ntherefore request those representatives wishing to\r\nparticipate in the debate on this item to inscribe their\r\nnames on the list as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): Like previous speakers,\r\nI wish to start by expressing our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his personal presentation of the\r\nreport on the work of the Organization before the opening\r\nof the general debate. We hope that this innovation,\r\nwhich we consider to be an integral element of the reform\r\nprocess, will be maintained and become a tradition.\r\nMr. Ortega Urbina (Nicaragua), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nIn our view, the Secretary-General’s report contains\r\nconcise and thoughtful coverage of United Nations\r\nactivities over the past year. It focuses our attention on a\r\nnumber of crucial questions with a direct relationship to\r\nthe issue of the relevance of this world body to the\r\nrequirements of the gradually emerging new era in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nAddressing the continuing process of drastic and\r\noften unpredictable changes in today’s complicated world,\r\nthe report highlights the major characteristic of the human\r\ncondition at the current stage of modern history. It is\r\nwidely recognized that most of the changes going on are\r\ncaused by the phenomenon of globalization. In this\r\nrespect, the Secretary-General has accurately formulated\r\nthe major, threefold challenge facing the international\r\ncommunity at the turn of the new century and new\r\nmillennium, which is\r\n“to understand better the emerging socio-economic\r\nforces and forms of globalization, to shape them to\r\nserve our needs and to respond effectively to their\r\ndeleterious consequences”. (A/53/1, para. 15)\r\nMy delegation cannot help reiterating the need for\r\nglobal responses to global challenges repeatedly stressed\r\nby the Secretary-General himself. It is the global\r\ninstitutions that are most suited to, and are expected to,\r\nprovide these responses, and in the final analysis nobody\r\nelse except us can forge them. This very clear philosophy,\r\nshared by many other actors of contemporary international\r\nrelations, has inspired my country, Ukraine, to take the\r\nposition of an active and staunch supporter of a stronger,\r\nmore efficient and more effective United Nations.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nIn this respect, we note with satisfaction that the report\r\nof the Secretary-General registers the first positive results\r\nof the “quiet revolution” of institutional reforms in this\r\nuniversal Organization that was initiated last year.\r\nWe feel especially proud that Ukraine’s representative,\r\nwho was honoured to preside over the fifty-second session\r\nof the General Assembly, made, as many delegations have\r\nconcluded, a valuable contribution to promoting this very\r\nimportant process.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to assure the\r\nPresident that our delegation will offer him every support\r\nin his efforts to facilitate progress during the consideration\r\nof the remaining proposals which the Secretary-General\r\noutlined in his report (A/51/950), “Renewing the United\r\nNations: a programme for reform”.\r\nFrom the experience of Ukraine’s presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we acquired firsthand knowledge of\r\nhow difficult is the task of ensuring progress in reforming\r\nan institution where the interests of 185 sovereign States\r\nare to be reduced to a common denominator. However, we\r\nstrongly advocate the need to move ahead along the road of\r\nchange, since there is a predominant interest in this\r\nendeavour, which is to enhance the capacity of the United\r\nNations to respond effectively to the requirements of a\r\nchanging world.\r\nIn this respect, we look forward to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report to the Millennium Assembly, wherein he\r\nintends to outline a new set of objectives and institutional\r\nmeans for the Organization as it moves into the new era.\r\nThe thematic overview of the work of the\r\nOrganization, contained in the main part of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, embraces all the key areas in which the\r\nUnited Nations is mandated to conduct its activities.\r\nHowever, since there is always room for perfection, my\r\ndelegation would like to make a number of remarks with\r\nregard to both the format and the contents of the report.\r\nFirst, I would like to recall resolution 51/241 of 31\r\nJuly 1997, containing a number of concrete provisions\r\ndesigned to influence future versions of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the work of the Organization. While\r\nsome have been taken into account in the present report, we\r\nhave to note that a number of other important measures\r\nhave yet to be implemented.\r\nSpecifically, in accordance with that resolution, the\r\nreport was supposed to contain a forward-looking section\r\nwhich “shall describe the specific goals for the Secretariat\r\nin the year ahead in the context of the work plan for the\r\nOrganization in the coming year, taking into account the\r\nmedium-term plan and the fact that the responsibility for\r\nestablishing priorities rests with the Member States”.\r\nFurthermore, it should have included “an analytical and\r\nconcise annex elaborating the costs by major programmes\r\nand activities of all bodies of the United Nations system,\r\nlocated both in and outside New York, according to their\r\nmandates, so as to improve Member States’ overview of\r\nsystem-wide issues”. (resolution 51/241, annex, paras. 6\r\nand 9)\r\nThe usefulness of these addenda is self-evident, and\r\nwe expect them to be included in reports on the work of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nOur next observation deals with the contents of the\r\nfirst three parts of the report, covering United Nations\r\nactivities in maintaining international peace and security,\r\nin the area of international cooperation for development\r\nand in the humanitarian field. We understand that it is\r\nvery difficult to retain the short and concise format of the\r\nreport, which we support very much, and at the same time\r\nto satisfy the requirement of presenting a complete record\r\nof the myriad activities the United Nations has\r\nundertaken.\r\nHowever, it is regrettable that some of the important\r\nareas of the Organization’s work were left outside the\r\npresent report. For example, we find no reference to the\r\nprogramme activities related to solving the specific\r\nproblems faced by the countries with economies in\r\ntransition. Furthermore, the report does not cover the\r\nefforts of the United Nations in the field of overcoming\r\nthe consequences of major technological disasters,\r\nincluding the Chernobyl catastrophe, the global\r\ndimensions and implications of which have been\r\nrepeatedly recognized by the General Assembly.\r\nI assume that other delegations may have their own\r\nexamples of other omissions. It is our hope that the\r\nSecretariat will take note of our remarks and will take the\r\nnecessary measures to avoid such omissions in the future.\r\nBy these remarks I do not wish to leave the\r\nimpression that our delegation underestimates the\r\nexcellent work done by the experts in the United Nations\r\nSecretariat who helped the Secretary-General to prepare\r\nhis report for this session. We were motivated only by the\r\nconviction that constructive criticism would be in a\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nreliable companion, promoting the spirit of reform reigning\r\nin the United Nations corridors.\r\nI would like to conclude by again stressing our\r\ncontinued support for the Secretary-General’s leadership in\r\nour common endeavour aimed at strengthening and\r\nrevitalizing this world Organization, and to reiterate the\r\nresolve of Ukraine to contribute actively to these efforts.\r\nMr. Amorim (Brazil): In his presentation of this\r\nyear’s report on the work of the Organization, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan highlighted the need for the United\r\nNations to rediscover the connection between peace and\r\neconomic security by pointing out that if the poor lack\r\ndevelopment even the richest on this planet will not be safe.\r\nWe agree entirely. Unfortunately, an international consensus\r\ncapable of marshalling the required political and economic\r\nresources into a coherent programme for economic\r\ndevelopment and improved governance at the global level\r\nhas yet to emerge.\r\nAt the same time, there are a certain encouraging signs\r\nthat deserve to be acknowledged. The recently concluded\r\ngeneral debate revealed a common aspiration to seek\r\ninternational solutions to our international problems.\r\nThe socio-economic forces unleashed by the still\r\nundisciplined phenomenon known as globalization have\r\npresented the international community with a new set of\r\nchallenges. In order to spread its more beneficial effects to\r\nthe greatest number, while minimizing its destructive\r\nbyproducts, it will be necessary to take full advantage of\r\nthe possibilities for joint analysis and cooperative action\r\noffered by the United Nations system. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral rightly reminds us, no other organization enjoys the\r\nscope and legitimacy of the United Nations. It is thus\r\nappropriate — and indeed desirable — that the United\r\nNations should take up its responsibilities in this domain by\r\nexercising leadership in the context of current international\r\nefforts to prevent globalization from disrupting the stability\r\nof those who have worked hard to earn it, while ensuring\r\nthat it leads to greater progress, prosperity and security for\r\nall.\r\nBrazil is reassured by the determination demonstrated\r\nby the Secretary-General to address the various dimensions\r\nof globalization as he prepares the United Nations for a\r\nnew era. By contrasting the stark economic realities in\r\nwhich the majority of humanity is forced to struggle with\r\nthe fact that the past half-century has witnessed one of the\r\nlongest periods of economic expansion in history, the\r\nSecretary-General’s report carries a strong warning to all\r\nthose who can still contemplate the growing gap between\r\nthe wealthiest and the neediest without perceiving its\r\npotential for destabilization on a wide and worrisome\r\nscale.\r\nWe believe that the Secretary-General deserves\r\ncredit for the series of concrete steps that he has been\r\ntaking in order to modernize the United Nations. The\r\ninstitutional reforms he initiated have undoubtedly\r\ncontributed to revitalizing the organizational machinery\r\nand improving accountability. It is now incumbent upon\r\nMember States to complete a process that should not be\r\nallowed to drag on into the new millennium. The very last\r\nparagraph of the Secretary-General’s report carries an\r\nunambiguous — though carefully worded — message to\r\nthis effect. It states\r\n“Reforming the United Nations institutional\r\nmachinery is but a first step towards refashioning its\r\nroles for the new era.” (A/53/1, para. 236)\r\nThe report concludes that the Millennium Assembly,\r\nwhich is to meet in less than two years, should\r\nconcentrate on substantive issues.\r\nIt follows that Member States should not shun their\r\nobligation to deal with the necessary revision of those\r\naspects of the Organization’s reform that only we have\r\nthe power to enact. As Minister Lampreia reminded the\r\nAssembly on 21 September:\r\n“For Brazil, reforming the United Nations\r\nnecessarily implies updating the functioning and\r\ncomposition of the Security Council, which still\r\nmirrors a period of history that is now long gone”\r\n(A/53/PV.7, p. 9).\r\nThere can be no justification for indefinitely prolonging\r\ndiscussions on this topic after five years of intensive, in-\r\ndepth consideration of all its aspects. As the only\r\nuniversally recognized instrument of collective security,\r\nthe Council is of particular importance to those among the\r\noverwhelming majority of United Nations Members that,\r\nlike Brazil, are not parties to any military alliance. As we\r\nevolve towards a more markedly multipolar world, the\r\nCouncil’s authority can, in principle, be exercised more\r\nfully in conformity with the original design of the\r\nCharter, given the necessary political will. A strong and\r\nrepresentative Security Council will likewise help to\r\nprevent the international order from degenerating again\r\ninto more unstable balance of power schemes, with\r\nincreasing rivalry for spheres of influence.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nFurthermore, just as it becomes apparent that the seven\r\nmajor industrialized Powers will not find satisfactory\r\nanswers to the financial problems of a globalized world\r\neconomy without taking into consideration the points of\r\nview of the developing world, it is also clear that the\r\npresent imbalances in the Security Council’s composition,\r\nparticularly in the permanent member category, constitute\r\na handicap to effective United Nations responses to an\r\ninternational security agenda that deals predominantly with\r\ncrises outside the developed world.\r\nWhile remaining within the Secretary-General’s\r\nunifying perspective of the relationship between peace and\r\neconomic security, my delegation is pleased to note that a\r\nview long held by Brazil has been endorsed in paragraph 30\r\nof the report, which highlights the need for a more dynamic\r\ninteraction between the Security Council and the Economic\r\nand Social Council. We wholeheartedly support the call for\r\ngiving a new operational meaning to Article 65 of the\r\nCharter — described in that paragraph of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report as a “dormant provision” — in order to\r\nbetter equip the United Nations to address the economic,\r\nsocial and humanitarian crises that threaten global security.\r\nMany of the problems the Security Council has been\r\ngrappling with, from dealing with mass flows of refugees\r\nto making sure war-torn societies do not again lapse into\r\nconflict, require an integrated approach that will\r\nsatisfactorily harmonize a number of economic and social\r\nvariables with security concerns. If peace, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral recalls, cannot be defined as mere absence of war\r\nbut is also a function of social and economic well-being, it\r\nis only natural that a more coordinated approach to promote\r\npeace should be sought, with improved relations between\r\nthe corresponding United Nations organs. We believe that\r\nthe establishment of a humanitarian segment in the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the existence of the\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are\r\ngood steps in that regard.\r\nWe must also express our satisfaction at the emphasis\r\nplaced by the Secretary-General on the concept of\r\ndiplomacy as a tool for replacing mistrust with confidence\r\nand reducing international threats to peace. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral is correct in arguing that the role of diplomacy is\r\nsometimes overlooked. As the representative of a country\r\nthat prides itself on its long diplomatic tradition, I can only\r\nwelcome the fact that diplomacy with a capital “D” has\r\nacquired a committed advocate in Mr. Kofi Annan. His\r\nmissions to Iraq and Nigeria, and his role in working\r\ntowards a negotiated settlement of the Timorese question,\r\nstand among his most notable accomplishments in the past\r\nyear — the accomplishments of a high-ranking\r\ninternational diplomat with an agenda exclusively\r\ndedicated to the advancement of peace.\r\nOne of the preceding speakers referred to the\r\nquestion of sanctions. The question of Security Council-\r\nimposed sanctions continues to be a matter of great\r\nconcern, and we regret that the Security Council has not\r\nyet been able to respond to General Assembly resolution\r\n51/242. Together with other members of the Council, we\r\nwill continue to work towards a much-needed\r\nreassessment of this instrument, with a twofold\r\npreoccupation: first, to enhance the effectiveness of\r\nsanctions and secondly, to ensure that humanitarian and\r\nother non-intended effects of sanctions are minimized or\r\neliminated.\r\nBrazil has built up and lived by a culture of peace,\r\nas pointed out by the Secretary-General himself in his trip\r\nto Brasilia last July. We continue to believe that coercion\r\ncan be contemplated only as a last resort, in extreme\r\ncircumstances, and that, for United Nations Members, the\r\nuse of force can be contemplated only in clear cases of\r\nself-defence or when collectively authorized by the\r\nSecurity Council. In today’s world, a culture of peace\r\nrequires respect for international law and a commitment\r\nto diplomacy and multilateralism even in the face of\r\nincomprehension by the mass media or at the risk of\r\nalienating certain segments of public opinion. The report\r\non the work of the Organization provides us with the\r\nnecessary reassurance that under the able leadership of\r\nSecretary-General, the United Nations remains not only\r\nour best hope for a worldwide culture of peace — one\r\ncapable of reconciling peace with economic security —\r\nbut also, as he eloquently puts it, a unique expression of\r\nour common humanity and an indispensable instrument\r\nfor achieving common goals.\r\nMr. Ryan (Ireland): We welcome the opportunity\r\nwhich this debate gives us to look back at some of the\r\nprincipal issues that were addressed over the past year\r\nand to measure how successfully we, the Member States,\r\nas well as the Organization as a whole, have tackled\r\nthem.\r\nIn the first place, I want to extend our gratitude to\r\nthe Secretary-General for the clarity and detail of his\r\nreport and for having introduced it personally to the\r\nAssembly at the beginning of the session. He encouraged\r\nus to read it from cover to cover, which indeed we have\r\ndone, for it reads easily and provides us with a succinct\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nbut perceptive analysis of some of the key issues which\r\naffect our work.\r\nWhat I believe emerges clearly from the pages of the\r\nreport is a description of a revitalized and increasingly\r\nenergetic and relevant Organization which has a central role\r\nto play in the way that the international community of\r\nnations deals with a myriad of often interlinking issues. The\r\nenormous challenges which they pose to us as Member\r\nStates and to the United Nations as an Organization are\r\naddressed clearly by the Secretary-General. It is our shared\r\nresponsibility, through our activities at all levels in this\r\nhouse, to contribute to finding solutions to those global\r\nproblems and at the same time to take action that will\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness of the response of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Secretary-General describes as a “quiet\r\nrevolution” the institutional reforms that he initiated last\r\nyear. They have indeed brought about a greater unity of\r\npurpose and coherence of effort. We warmly congratulate\r\nhim, the Deputy Secretary-General and the members of the\r\nSecretariat for the success they have brought to this\r\nimportant endeavour. Change in any large organization is\r\nnever easy to accomplish, and in one as complex as this it\r\ncan be especially hard. We recognize that patience must be\r\nexercised on the road forward, and we hope that when he\r\nreports to us next year, the benefits which will flow from\r\na streamlined and more cohesive Secretariat will be visible\r\nto all.\r\nThe establishment of the Department for Disarmament\r\nAffairs has been a particularly welcome development, and\r\nunder the direction of its highly distinguished Under-\r\nSecretary-General it has already undertaken some important\r\nwork. The designation of this Department as a focal point\r\nfor all United Nations action on small arms, together with\r\nthe proposal for multisectoral and coordinated action on\r\nsmall arms, is both timely and welcome.\r\nIf the last session of the General Assembly can be\r\ndescribed as the “Assembly of reform”, the present session\r\nshould not be remembered as the “Assembly of no reform”.\r\nWhile we can be justifiably satisfied with what was\r\nachieved last year, we should not rest on our laurels.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly reminds us in his report\r\nthat a number of reform proposals remain to be approved.\r\nAmong these are some to which my delegation attaches\r\nconsiderable importance, and we hope that with some\r\nfurther work it will be possible to reach consensus on them.\r\nThe Development Account, for example, is a valuable\r\nconcept which must be made to work. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has provided some useful clarifications which we\r\nhope will allow this issue to develop in a positive fashion\r\nfor the benefit of developing countries.\r\nThe role which the United Nations can play in\r\nworking for greater peace and security in today’s world\r\nis addressed fully by the Secretary-General in his report.\r\nIn his statement in the general debate, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Ireland spoke of the need to address\r\nthe root causes of conflict. The holistic concept of\r\nsecurity which the United Nations is embracing serves to\r\nreinforce the correctness of this approach.\r\nExtreme poverty and underdevelopment are given\r\ntheir proper place in the report’s overview. They are the\r\nenemies of peace, and all too often they are the allies of\r\ninstability, disorder and conflict. We must recognize these\r\nfacts, just as we acknowledge that there can be no real\r\nsecurity without development. Too many of today’s\r\nconflicts stem from poverty caused by chronic\r\nunderdevelopment, human rights abuse and political\r\ninstability. The importance of good governance, respect\r\nfor human rights and democratization are rightly\r\nemphasized by the Secretary-General, and these are all\r\nareas in which the United Nations can and should make\r\na lasting contribution.\r\nThe report addresses the broad theme of\r\nglobalization and offers some lucid insights into how the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations can\r\nengage it. The financial uncertainty in important regional\r\nfinancial markets around the world has, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral points out, exacted steep and possibly long-\r\nlasting social costs. It is still too early to say how these\r\ncan be arrested and what steps can be taken to make\r\nglobalization work for the betterment of mankind.\r\nThe adoption in July of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court was a historic development.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s fervent hope that a\r\nlarge majority of Member States will have signed and\r\nratified it by the end of the year 2000. I am pleased to\r\nsay that Ireland will sign the Statute in two days’ time in\r\nRome.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nA central message of the report is the continuing\r\nimportance of multilateral diplomacy in a world of rapid\r\nand often baffling change. It provides each of us, small\r\nand large, with a platform to explain and better\r\nunderstand. And it remains the best hope for the many\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nstill unheard voices to gain an audience. The year since the\r\nSecretary-General last reported on the work of the\r\nOrganization has witnessed a number of challenges which\r\nonly a multilateral body such as ours could have the\r\nauthority to meet.\r\nAs we move towards the new millennium, the\r\nchallenges we face will not, alas, grow less in number.\r\nHowever, we can take some comfort from the fact that we\r\nare beginning to make this Organization more responsive to\r\nthe challenges and more effective and efficient in the way\r\nin which it handles them.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I would like at the outset to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the preparation and\r\nintroduction of the report contained in document A/53/1.\r\nFrom its very first lines, the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral identifies the difficulties, the uncertainties and even\r\nthe anxieties over the role that is performed by multilateral\r\norganizations in a rapidly and constantly changing\r\ninternational context.\r\nWe agree that the Millennium Assembly to be held in\r\nthe year 2000 affords an exceptional opportunity for leaders\r\nfrom all parts of the world to consider the type of\r\nOrganization that the new century demands. The\r\nMillennium Assembly should be carefully prepared through\r\nthe intergovernmental process. That Assembly will make it\r\npossible to study thoroughly, among other issues, how the\r\ncommitments undertaken in the United Nations conferences\r\nheld in recent years are being carried out.\r\nWe have had only a short time to evaluate the results\r\nof the reforms sponsored by the Secretary-General and\r\nadopted by the General Assembly in its capacity as the\r\nforemost body of the United Nations. Nevertheless, we are\r\nfully confident that reforms will soon begin to surface in all\r\nareas of activity of the Organization.\r\nThe General Assembly will be considering the\r\nproposals made by the Secretary-General during this\r\nsession, and my delegation is committed to participating in\r\nthese deliberations in a constructive spirit. We will uphold\r\nthe purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter, the\r\nmandates given by the General Assembly and the need to\r\nprovide the Organization with ways and means to better\r\nface the challenges of both the present and the future.\r\nThe initiative for the United Nations to enter into a\r\nmutually beneficial dialogue with the international business\r\ncommunity is indeed very interesting. The idea deserves to\r\nbe considered in depth by the General Assembly within\r\nthe framework of the rules and procedures of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe understand and share the concern of the\r\nSecretary-General on the need for the Organization to\r\nstrengthen its initiative in the field of conflict prevention.\r\nThis point is obvious, since Article 1 of the Charter states\r\nas a purpose of the United Nations the prevention and\r\nremoval of threats to the peace and the suppression of\r\nacts of aggression.\r\nIn addition, the Charter clearly sets forth the\r\nfunctions and powers of each of the principal organs of\r\nthe Organization. In accordance with Articles 10 and 11\r\nof the Charter, the General Assembly may discuss any\r\nquestions or any matters within the scope of the Charter\r\nand may make recommendations on such questions or\r\nmatters. It may also consider the general principles of\r\ncooperation in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, and it may discuss any matter in regard to these\r\nquestions.\r\nIn accordance with Article 14, the General Assembly\r\nmay recommend measures for the peaceful settlement of\r\nany situation, regardless of origin, which it deems likely\r\nto impair the general welfare or friendly relations among\r\nnations, including situations resulting from a violation of\r\nthe provisions of the Charter setting forth the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations.\r\nFor its part, in accordance with Article 24, the\r\nSecurity Council, specifically and exclusively, has the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIt is necessary to improve the working relationship\r\namong the principal organs of the Organization, keeping,\r\nhowever, the allocation of functions and powers as\r\ncontained in the Charter and bearing in mind the\r\nfundamental role it grants the General Assembly as the\r\nsupreme body of the Organization.\r\nWe agree with the report’s assessment that\r\nresolutions imposing binding sanctions should consider\r\nexemptions for humanitarian reasons and the effects on\r\nthird States. Also pertinent are the calls made in this\r\nregard by certain bodies entrusted with supervising human\r\nrights treaties with respect to the need for sanctions\r\nregimes to provide for concrete measures in order to\r\nprotect the human rights of the most vulnerable groups.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nThe diagnosis of the world’s economic and social\r\nsituation and the data contained in the report are indeed\r\ndramatic, and they highlight the same realities that are\r\nclearly underlined by the recently published Human\r\nDevelopment Report.\r\nThe fact that one fifth of mankind is forced to survive\r\non only a dollar a day, that one third of all Africans are not\r\nexpected to survive past the age of 40, that 40 per cent of\r\nwomen in developing countries are illiterate and that 50 per\r\ncent of South Asian children are underweight at the age of\r\nfive contrasts dramatically with the economic expansion\r\nthat has taken place during the second half of this century.\r\nIt also contrasts with the fact that the volume of external\r\naid to the developing countries has declined steadily\r\nthroughout recent decades.\r\nHere we see one of the greatest challenges to the\r\ninternational community in general, and to the United\r\nNations in particular. Though it is true that the reforms of\r\nthe Organization already implemented are positive and point\r\nin the right direction, the magnitude of the challenge\r\nrequires that the Organization do much more than reform\r\nand streamline its functioning. It requires, in addition, the\r\nfirm commitment and political will of the industrialized\r\ncountries.\r\nThe United Nations is a capable tool for the States and\r\nthe peoples of the world to take advantage of opportunities\r\nand to face the challenges posed by globalization. We agree\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s opinion that the economic,\r\nsocial and environmental dimensions of globalization, and,\r\neven more so, the so-called transnationalization of “uncivil”\r\nelements, require multilateral action by the United Nations\r\nand by other international institutions. Accordingly, we\r\nbelieve that public action should be supported, especially as\r\nregards globalization.\r\nFinally, I wish to draw attention to the dramatic\r\ncontrast existing between, on the one hand, the complexity\r\nof the challenges and the high expectations of world public\r\nopinion regarding the role that the Organization could play\r\nto face these challenges, and, on the other, the financial\r\nsituation of the United Nations. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral informs us that the deficit in the regular budget and\r\nthe unpaid assessments of some countries have been\r\ncompounded by the fact that countries used to pay on time\r\nhave stopped doing so.\r\nIf the critical financial situation is not overcome, it\r\nwill be very difficult indeed for the Organization to carry\r\nout the work expected of it much less to set serious and\r\nambitious targets for the next century.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Bangladesh is happy\r\nthat this year the Secretary-General was given the\r\nopportunity, as he was last year for the first time in\r\nUnited Nations history, to introduce his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization at the beginning of the general\r\ndebate. This is a very welcome arrangement, and should\r\ncontinue to be followed. The membership should be made\r\naware of this beforehand; we believe this procedure will\r\nmake the general debate more focused and issues-driven,\r\ncentring on those issues identified in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. Bangladesh also believes that in addition\r\nto recounting the activities of the previous year, the\r\nSecretary-General needs to identify in his report issues\r\nthat have the potential to challenge the international\r\ncommunity in the coming years and to ask world leaders\r\nto address those issues during the general debate. We\r\nwould ask you, Mr. President, and the Secretary-General\r\nto give serious thought to this suggestion. The references\r\nin this year’s report to the Millennium Assembly and to\r\npending reform issues and the proposal to convene global\r\ntown meetings are ideas in that direction.\r\nThis year’s report is very readable and presents in a\r\nuser-friendly manner various mandated activities of the\r\nworld body. Focus on substantive issues and issues of\r\ninstitutional reform is appropriately balanced and draws\r\nattention to the fact that both aspects require full and\r\nthorough consideration by us, the Member States, if we\r\nwant the United Nations to succeed.\r\nBangladesh finds it comforting to be advised by the\r\nSecretary-General that “the United Nations family today\r\nacts with greater unity of purpose and coherence of effort\r\nthan it did a year ago” (A/53/1, para. 4). We are happy to\r\nlearn that the Secretary-General’s quiet revolution of\r\ninstitutional reforms is bearing results and that new\r\nteamwork is leading the reform efforts in the Secretariat.\r\nBangladesh wants to commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor giving good attention to dialogue with the\r\ninternational business community, drawing a parallel with\r\nthe close working relationships the United Nations has\r\nwith non-governmental organizations. We want this area\r\nof activity to be given increased attention in future\r\nreports, focusing on the involvement of the business\r\ncommunity in furthering the United Nations development\r\nagenda.\r\nThe assertion by the Secretary-General that “the role\r\nof diplomacy is so central to virtually all United Nations\r\nactivities that its specific contribution is sometimes\r\noverlooked” (para. 31) is very perceptive and worthy of\r\nour full cognizance. The attention given to diplomacy in\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\ngeneral, and to preventive diplomacy in particular, in\r\nparagraphs 31 to 42 of the report is very well deserved. In\r\nthe area of disarmament, the Secretary-General has rightly\r\nhighlighted the need “to curb the flow of small arms\r\ncirculating in civil society” (para. 50) and advocates the\r\nholding of a United Nations conference on all aspects of the\r\nillicit arms trade in the near future.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s advocacy of “smart sanctions”\r\nwhich seek to pressure regimes rather than peoples and\r\nwhich would thus reduce humanitarian costs will be\r\nsupported by a majority of our membership, and we would\r\nask the Secretary-General to sharpen the concept of targeted\r\nsanctions in his proposals to the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In the area of post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding, the need to link all aspects — political,\r\nhumanitarian, developmental and human rights — of\r\nexternal support for conflict-ridden countries has been\r\nunderscored. We hope that in the next report the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will present details of the new strategic framework\r\nconcept for peace-building, as elaborated by the\r\nAdministrative Committee on Coordination.\r\nTo Bangladesh, the development mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations has special significance, and we are\r\nsatisfied that due attention has been given in the report to\r\ncooperating for development. Information on the activities\r\nof the United Nations Development Group and the\r\nExecutive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs,\r\nthough sketchy, is noteworthy, as this is first time that such\r\ninformation has been included in the report. In view of the\r\nwide-ranging implications of the work of the Development\r\nGroup, the Secretary-General should devote greater space\r\nin his reports to its activities. He should also report on\r\nprogress on work on development indicators undertaken by\r\nthe Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs.\r\nIn the section on poverty eradication, Bangladesh\r\nbelieves that the emerging role of microcredit, including the\r\ninitiation of the $40 million dollar microstart programme of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, should have\r\nfound a place in the report. We would also like to see the\r\nsituation in the least developed countries, including\r\nlandlocked and small island developing countries, given a\r\nmerited separate section in future reports, in view of the\r\nvulnerability of those countries in the globalization process.\r\nSocial development, in particular in recent years, has\r\nemerged as a critical area of the United Nations\r\ndevelopment agenda. A more analytical and well-structured\r\nsection on this subject would be desirable in future.\r\nElaboration on United Nations activities in the area of\r\nreproductive health is sadly absent in the report.\r\nThe Secretary-General has done well to draw the\r\nattention of the international community to the\r\ntransnationalization of “uncivil” elements along with the\r\nemergence of a global civil society. This is an area which\r\nneeds our concerted attention and action; it should\r\ncontinue to be addressed in the report as we discuss the\r\nsituation in an increasingly interconnected world. We\r\nwould also like the Secretary-General to include in his\r\nreport activities relating to the right to development, in\r\nview of its centrality in the human rights regime.\r\nBangladesh is pleased that considerable attention has\r\nbeen given in the report to accountability and oversight.\r\nThis should continue in future. United Nations monitoring\r\nof improvements in its operations and reforms requires\r\nclose attention by Member States and should be reported\r\nupon regularly in a transparent manner. We are somewhat\r\nconcerned about the 80 per cent implementation of\r\nmandated activities of the Organization. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral considers that to be “largely positive”\r\n(para. 222). We would expect the implementation rate of\r\nall reform initiatives to further increase.\r\nWe started by commending the Secretary-General for\r\nhis well-balanced report, and we also believe that our\r\nsuggestions and ideas should receive needed consideration\r\nin the context of future reports.\r\nMr. Henze (Germany): I would like first of all to\r\nthank the Secretary-General and his associates for their\r\ntimely report on the work of the Organization. They have\r\npresented us with a document that vividly depicts the\r\ncomplex and difficult problems that confronted the\r\nOrganization over the past 12 months.\r\nUnited Nations reform — that is the reform of all\r\nUnited Nations bodies — is a complicated and therefore\r\nat times slow process. But it is a process that is necessary\r\nto enable the Organization to meet the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century. The report describes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s institutional reforms, which he has very much\r\nto the point called a “quiet revolution”. Germany\r\nwelcomes these reforms as an important contribution\r\ntowards revitalizing the United Nations. We believe that\r\nall Member States will eventually benefit from a reform\r\nof all the Organization’s bodies. The measures which the\r\nSecretary-General has taken so far have already led to a\r\ntangible improvement of communication and procedures\r\nwithin the Secretariat.\r\nTrack one and track two reforms will allow the\r\noperational structures of United Nations funds and\r\nprogrammes to have a greater impact. We believe that the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nadoption of a funding strategy that seeks to combine results\r\nand resources in a multi-year funding framework is another\r\nsignificant step in the same direction. The United Nations\r\nmust pursue this path with determination as well as a sense\r\nof urgency. There must be no erosion of the United Nations\r\ndevelopment role. We do not wish to see other players\r\nassume this role. We wish to see a vigorous United Nations\r\nand we therefore encourage the Secretary-General to\r\ncontinue and to expand his reforms.\r\nWe very much agree with the Secretary-General’s\r\nanalysis of globalization and its consequences, as well as\r\nwith your assessment, Mr. President, of these phenomena,\r\nas made in your statement before the Assembly on 9\r\nSeptember. The present crises in the world show that we\r\ninescapably live in a global context. The United Nations is\r\npar excellence the institution that can deal with global\r\nquestions. It is therefore incumbent upon the United\r\nNations to respond to these challenges. Our common future\r\ncan only be shaped through common efforts. These must\r\ninclude Governments, but also other entities such as non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and multinational corporations.\r\nAt the end of the twentieth century, too many of our\r\nworld’s people still suffer from poverty and unemployment.\r\nGermany therefore welcomes the efforts of the United\r\nNations to arouse support for the 20/20 Initiative. The\r\nInitiative’s proposals for the provision of basic social\r\nservices like education, health care and shelter will be\r\nessential for future social development.\r\nThe world is not yet a fair place for all its inhabitants.\r\nNot everywhere are people put at the centre of\r\ndevelopment. It is unfortunately not everywhere that women\r\nare no longer exposed to discrimination. Three years after\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development, held in\r\nCopenhagen, and the World Conference on Women, held in\r\nBeijing, it is time to take stock and design future initiatives.\r\nTwo special sessions of the General Assembly in the year\r\n2000 will provide opportunities to reconfirm our\r\ncommitment to implement the results of both conferences.\r\nThese special sessions will also give us a chance to explore\r\nnew territory. Globalization must be tamed so that it does\r\nnot threaten socially and economically vulnerable groups.\r\nGlobalization must be shaped so as to contribute to social\r\ndevelopment and economic returns for both men and\r\nwomen. These are issues the special sessions should\r\nconsider attentively.\r\nThe turmoil in the world’s financial markets\r\ndemonstrates drastically how important it is for\r\nGovernments and the relevant international institutions to\r\ntake preventive action in time. The impact of the financial\r\ncrisis which has spread from one region to another has\r\nalready affected a large number of national economies. It\r\nshows that the world economy needs an improved\r\nframework. The measures discussed at the spring meeting\r\nof the Interim Committee of the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF) are indispensable in order to prevent future\r\ncrises. But we have to think even further. We have to\r\nbroach the question of whether and how multilaterally\r\nagreed interventions could become necessary and useful.\r\nSuch interventions would surely be more appropriate than\r\nunilateral protective measures.\r\nWe need better early-warning devices, more\r\ntransparency and more efficiency in banking systems,\r\nespecially, but not only, in the newly emerging\r\neconomies. Again, this is not a task for Governments\r\nalone. We need a global partnership between public and\r\nprivate institutions; a partnership between Governments,\r\ninternational financial organizations and corporations.\r\nAnd, furthermore, as the Secretary-General put it in his\r\nreport, “a bridge must be constructed between ... the Dow\r\nJones index and the human development index”. (A/53/1,\r\npara. 15)\r\nThe adoption of the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court marked a major step forward towards a\r\nworld order in which the force of law and not the law of\r\nforce prevails. Perpetrators of the most heinous crimes\r\nwill no longer go unpunished. Germany will continue to\r\nvigorously support the establishment of the International\r\nCourt. Let me assure the Assembly that my country is\r\nworking wholeheartedly for the early entry into force of\r\nthe Rome Statute. Germany intends to sign the Statute\r\nbefore the fiftieth anniversary of the Genocide Convention\r\nin December 1998. We will encourage all countries to\r\nsign and ratify the Statute as soon as possible. We will\r\nactively cooperate in drafting a resolution to that effect\r\nduring this session. We look forward to participating\r\nactively in next year’s work of the Preparatory\r\nCommission.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has declared the\r\ntwenty-first century a century of prevention. As I have\r\nalready pointed out in my remarks on the state of the\r\nworld’s financial system, he has done so with good\r\nreason. Trouble must be nipped in the bud. This is the\r\ntask of preventive diplomacy, of human rights observers\r\nand of peacekeeping forces. We must prevent large\r\nnumbers of people from having to flee their countries or\r\nleave them in search of employment. To strike at the root\r\nof mass migration means eliminating their economic,\r\necological and social causes. The gap between rich and\r\npoor grows wider, and this gap must no longer be\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nallowed to grow. It must be closed. All nations must be\r\ngiven a fair chance in global competition. Hence richer\r\ncountries must help those that are poorer to make the most\r\nof their opportunities for development.\r\nAfrica shows what can be achieved when the\r\ninternational community and the countries that experience\r\nproblems join hands. Today democratic elections are held\r\nin more than half of the African countries. In 20 African\r\ncountries economic growth is between 4 per cent and 6 per\r\ncent; in 11 it is even higher. However, old and new\r\nconflicts in Africa — particularly the continuing violence\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the unresolved\r\nconflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the increasing\r\ntension in Angola — continue to be a source of serious\r\nconcern. We commend the tireless efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, his representatives and their teams in bringing\r\nabout peaceful solutions.\r\nI would like to stress our particular appreciation for\r\nthose sections of the report that analyse the causes of\r\nconflict in Africa and contain proposals for the promotion\r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in Africa.\r\nDuring the recent meeting between the Secretary-General\r\nand representatives of donor countries we have pledged our\r\nfull support for his proposals. We will continue to actively\r\ncooperate with the African nations, keeping in mind the\r\nintrinsic link between peace and development.\r\nWith the new millennium ahead, we must act together\r\nto shape our future. A reformed and strengthened United\r\nNations will play a paramount role in the fulfilment of the\r\ntask that lies ahead.\r\nMs. Wensley (Australia): Australia welcomes the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General. We believe that this is an\r\nexcellent report which identifies the substantial challenges\r\nthe Organization is facing as we prepare ourselves for the\r\nnew millennium.\r\nI want to concentrate on two of the challenges only\r\nthat the Secretary-General has identified: United Nations\r\nreform and the impact of globalization.\r\nOn the issue of United Nations reform, we applaud the\r\nconsiderable progress made by the Secretariat over the last\r\nyear under the astute and thoughtful leadership of the\r\nSecretary-General. Much has been done, but more,\r\nobviously, remains to be done.\r\nOur position in support of ongoing reform is very well\r\nknown. In the jargon of management consultants, it is a\r\nprocess of continuous improvement. We thought that the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General captured the thought very well\r\nin a recent comment when she described the reform\r\nprocess that the Secretariat is undergoing as “the pursuit\r\nof excellence”.\r\nOne thing that is very important to us and that we\r\nhope to see is the ongoing reform objectives identified\r\nand brought together in a clear programme of track three\r\nactivities.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report highlights the\r\nMillennium Assembly as an opportunity to look ahead at\r\nthe kind of Organization that we will need in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. We very much look forward to receiving his\r\nreport on this issue. We support strongly the view\r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General in his address during\r\nthe general debate that if we are to capitalize on this\r\nopportunity, we need to identify a practical, achievable\r\nprogramme of action. It would be very much a lost\r\nopportunity if all that eventuated was an elaborate\r\nconsultative process and a costly ceremonial exercise.\r\nOne critical reform issue that my Government\r\ncertainly would like to see resolved before the new\r\nmillennium is that of reform of the Security Council.\r\nUnless we can proceed with this, this Organization will\r\nnot be able to claim that it has adapted successfully to the\r\nworld in which we live today. My delegation looks\r\nforward to debating those issues and that subject in much\r\nmore detail under later agenda items.\r\nThe second major challenge facing the United\r\nNations which I wish to address is that of globalization.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report and the prominence of the\r\nissue in the general debate clearly underline the\r\nsignificance of this issue for the United Nations. Renewed\r\ninternational cooperation is needed to examine the\r\nfunctioning in particular of the international financial\r\narchitecture, a process that is under way this week in\r\nWashington and in which Australia is very pleased to be\r\nparticipating.\r\nIn dealing with the impact of globalization and to\r\nensure we can take advantage of its benefits and\r\nopportunities, the very first responsibility, of course, rests\r\nwith each and every one of us to ensure that we have in\r\nplace the appropriate domestic policies and mechanisms,\r\nincluding prudent corporate governance and efficient and\r\ntransparent financial sectors.\r\nInternational cooperation has a valuable role to play\r\nin helping countries address deficiencies in these areas,\r\nand it is important to recall that a number of initiatives\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nare already very well established. Technical assistance\r\nprogrammes are helping to develop, strengthen and reform\r\nexisting mechanisms and institutional frameworks in\r\ndeveloping countries so they can better exploit the\r\nopportunities globalization has to offer.\r\nMy Government has been very closely involved in a\r\nnumber of such programmes at the bilateral, regional and\r\nmultilateral levels. In the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation Council (APEC), we are leading efforts to\r\nstrengthen the capacities of our regional partners, including\r\nparticularly in this area of corporate governance.\r\nAt the multilateral level, the efforts of the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) in responding to the difficulties faced\r\nmost recently by Thailand, Indonesia and Korea underline\r\nits key role. We are very pleased to have made a major\r\ncontribution to each of those assistance packages. In the\r\ncase of the Indonesian package, we worked particularly\r\nhard to ensure that greater recognition was given to\r\nunderstanding and managing the social impact of the\r\neconomic reforms that were being introduced, something\r\nthat my colleague from Bangladesh has just underlined and\r\nsomething that I think the United Nations would do well in\r\nparticular to focus on.\r\nThe IMF itself has acknowledged that it has learned\r\nfrom its experience in responding to the economic crisis in\r\nEast Asia. While the affected economies proceed with\r\nimplementing structural reforms which will provide a\r\nstronger foundation for future economic growth, there has\r\nalso emerged a recognition of the importance of\r\nstrengthening the existing international financial\r\narchitecture.\r\nI think it is important that in examining ways to do\r\nthis and asking ourselves what is it that the United Nations\r\ncan and should do, it is vitally important that the\r\ncommitment to strengthening the international trading\r\nsystem does not wane. Countries need to work together\r\nbilaterally, regionally and through the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) to ensure that the momentum towards\r\nfurther liberalization of the international trading system is\r\nmaintained.\r\nCooperation and partnership at the international level\r\ncan do a good deal to promote global best practice in\r\nfinancial systems, improve transparency and strengthen\r\nnational capacities. Considerable effort is already under way\r\nin a number of forums in and around the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions — not least the discussions to which I referred,\r\nwhich are taking place in Washington this week.\r\nThe United Nations, we believe, has an important\r\nrole in the broader discussion of globalization, working\r\nwith rather than attempting to duplicate the role of other\r\ninternational agencies and forums. We need always to\r\nconsider where expertise lies and how the United Nations\r\ncan add value. In this connection, the United Nations\r\ndevelopment agencies have a very important place in\r\nassisting the developing countries themselves address the\r\nsocial implications of recent economic difficulties. There\r\nis scope, we believe, to redirect some resources to address\r\nthe adverse social implications of economic volatility in\r\na number of vulnerable countries — indeed, it is good to\r\nnote that some agencies have already made progress in\r\nthis regard.\r\nThe recent high-level dialogue on globalization was\r\nan invaluable opportunity for countries to share their\r\nexperiences and exchange views on how international\r\ncooperation can assist. We felt very encouraged by this\r\ndebate. We thought it was remarkably free of some of the\r\npolemic that characterizes North-South exchanges in this\r\nHouse. We felt very appreciative to all those who were\r\ninvolved, and we look forward to that spirit prevailing as\r\nwe continue to debate globalization throughout this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation generally looks forward to\r\ncontributing to the ongoing discussion of this important\r\nissue of globalization and with the other challenges which\r\nthe Secretary-General has identified in the report that we\r\nare considering in this first substantive plenary meeting of\r\nthe fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): First of all, the\r\nMongolian delegation would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for presenting a concise but comprehensive report\r\non the work of the Organization and on a partnership for\r\nglobal community. Like the previous one, this year’s\r\nreport highlights the most significant aspects of the\r\nUnited Nations activities and points out the immediate\r\nand long-term tasks facing the Organization. The report\r\nis thought-provoking and addresses many of the\r\nchallenges that lie ahead for the international community.\r\nThe fact that this item is being considered\r\nimmediately after the general debate is in itself\r\nsignificant. This provides representatives the opportunity\r\nto look back at the work of this Organization — in fact,\r\nat the collective work of the Member States and the\r\nSecretariat — in a broad context, instead of just\r\nexamining one or another aspect of United Nations\r\nactivities. In today’s context, such a debate provides the\r\nopportunity to view United Nations activities through the\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nprism of the ongoing “quiet revolution”, looking towards its\r\nfurther improvement as an indispensable instrument for the\r\ncooperation of States in the next millennium.\r\nWe believe that the report is balanced; it is analytical\r\nand provides reference material. It shows what has been\r\nachieved during the past year and what still needs to be\r\ndone. Therefore, we welcome the report as a good basis for\r\nour debate.\r\nSince my delegation will have the opportunity to\r\ncomment on specific aspects of the report when agenda\r\nitems are discussed here in the plenary and in the Main\r\nCommittees, at this stage I would like to touch upon the\r\nfollowing few questions.\r\nWith regard to United Nations reform, since we all\r\nagree that the reform is a process and not an event, it\r\ncannot be achieved overnight. My delegation believes that\r\nduring its fifty-second session the General Assembly was\r\nable to do a great deal of work, as reflected in the report.\r\nHowever, during the current session we still need to address\r\nthe pending issues concerning the sunset provisions, the\r\nquestion of adopting a results-based budget system, the\r\nterms for establishing the Development Account and some\r\nothers. However, we believe that the success of the reform\r\nof the Organization could be judged, in the final analysis,\r\non the basis of real improvements in responding to the\r\nurgent and vital challenges that lie ahead and the impact on\r\nthe lives of ordinary peoples. Accordingly, we believe that\r\nthe reform should focus on strengthening the role of the\r\nOrganization in the promotion of development. The role of\r\nthe General Assembly as the main deliberative and\r\ndecision-making organ of the United Nations, in which all\r\nMember States participate equally, should be enhanced in\r\naccordance, of course, with the United Nations Charter.\r\nNo reform of the United Nations would be complete\r\nwithout the reform of the Security Council. In this respect\r\nmy delegation welcomes the steps taken by the Security\r\nCouncil in response to General Assembly resolutions,\r\nespecially with respect to its working procedures and\r\ntransparency. This work should be continued. Though the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group has made some progress,\r\nespecially with respect to cluster II issues, no progress,\r\nunfortunately, has been made on the cluster I issues,\r\nespecially on the expansion of the Security Council and\r\ncurtailing the veto malpractice. These questions should be\r\naddressed squarely if we are to enter the next millennium\r\nwith a more effective and efficient United Nations.\r\nMy delegation agrees with the Secretary-General that\r\nthe Millennium Assembly, expected to be held in\r\nSeptember 2000, should be used as a unique opportunity\r\nto define clearly what kind of United Nations the\r\ninternational community envisions and would support in\r\nthe new century. The preparatory work for the\r\nMillennium Assembly should start as soon as possible so\r\nas to enable the Member States not only to elaborate their\r\ncommon strategic vision of the world and the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in it, but also to identify as clearly as\r\npossible the ways and means of achieving these ends.\r\nWithout the latter, the noble aims and strategic vision risk\r\nremaining an unfulfilled aspiration.\r\nThe section on peace and security clearly\r\ndemonstrates that the United Nations is called upon to\r\nplay a very important role in prevention, peacekeeping\r\nand post-conflict peace-building — and indeed, it can do\r\nso. In this respect, my delegation would like to underline\r\nthe positive role that the Secretary-General played in\r\ndefusing the tension in the Persian Gulf area last\r\nFebruary, although, as he has underlined in his report,\r\n“Unfortunately, the situation in Iraq still appears to\r\nbe far from resolution.” (A/53/1, para. 24)\r\nTurning to the part on disarmament, my delegation\r\nwould like to underline its support for the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to further promote the cause of\r\nnuclear disarmament. In this regard, we support the eight-\r\nnation declaration on creating a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nworld as an important step in the wake of the troubling\r\nnuclear-weapon tests in South Asia. It is in this context\r\nthat Mongolia welcomes the declaration of the People’s\r\nRepublic of China not to resume nuclear tests and\r\nexpresses the hope that the latest encouraging signs from\r\nSouth Asia will be followed up with concrete actions that\r\nwould lead to strengthening the non-proliferation regime\r\nand move us closer to nuclear disarmament. We believe\r\nthat the two ad hoc committees established in the\r\nConference on Disarmament could be instrumental in\r\nincreasing the security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon\r\nStates and in banning the production of fissile material for\r\nnuclear-explosive devices.\r\nWhen it comes to the question of international\r\nsecurity, every nation, big and small alike, can and should\r\nmake its contributions. As a Member of the United\r\nNations, Mongolia is striving to make its contribution in\r\npromoting confidence and the goals of disarmament. Thus\r\nMongolia recently published its white book on defence,\r\nsent its reply to the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms and took steps to participate in\r\npeacekeeping activities. Moreover, having declared its\r\nterritory a nuclear-weapon-free zone, it is now actively\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nworking to institutionalize its nuclear-weapon-free status,\r\nwhich would make its territory an area of peace, stability\r\nand predictability. In 1999, Mongolia, together with the\r\nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament\r\nin Asia and the Pacific, will host an international\r\nconference in Mongolia to focus on the pressing\r\ndisarmament and other security-related issues of the region.\r\nTurning to the sections of the report on cooperation\r\nfor development and globalization, my delegation would\r\nlike to underline the enormous work being carried out by\r\nthe United Nations Development Group, as well as its\r\nsupport for the creation of the United Nations Development\r\nAssistance Frameworks, which, as the Secretary-General\r\npoints out, permit a new strategic approach to the\r\nimplementation of goals agreed to at United Nations global\r\nconferences and of national development priorities.\r\nLikewise, we commend the efforts of the United Nations,\r\nespecially the United Nations Development Programme and\r\nthe World Food Programme, in combating poverty.\r\nOne of the factors, or should I say handicaps, that\r\nnegatively affects the development of some 30 developing\r\ncountries is lack of access to the sea due to their\r\ngeographical location. This has been recognized by the\r\ninternational community, and some concrete steps are being\r\ntaken by the United Nations to address this and related\r\nissues. It would have been very useful if the report had\r\nshed some light on the steps taken in this field within the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nTurning to the section on strengthening the\r\ninternational legal order, my delegation would like to\r\nunderline the importance of the outcome of the Rome\r\nConference, especially the adoption and signature by many\r\nStates of the Statute of the International Criminal Court.\r\nWe fully agree with the Secretary-General that\r\n“Although many would have preferred the Court\r\nto have been vested with more far-reaching powers,\r\none should not minimize the breakthrough that was\r\nachieved.” (A/53/1, para. 181)\r\nThe Court’s general jurisdiction over such crimes as\r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the\r\ncrime of aggression should be strengthened further during\r\nthe subsequent work in the preparatory commission that is\r\nto be established soon.\r\nFinally, in the view of my delegation, the report\r\nshould have focused more extensively on the question of\r\ncombating international terrorism and on the ways and\r\nmeans to enhance international cooperation in this field. We\r\nhope that these comments and observations will be taken\r\ninto account by the Secretary-General in his activities and\r\nreflected in the next report.\r\nMr. Ordzhonikidze (Russian Federation)\r\n(interpretation from Russian): The key points of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on the work of the\r\nOrganization reaffirm convincingly that the United\r\nNations, being the sole universal international\r\nOrganization — better equipped than any other world\r\nbody to formulate agreed approaches and to resolve\r\nconflict situations — can provide appropriate responses to\r\nthe global challenges faced by the international\r\ncommunity at the turn of the millennium.\r\nIt is from this standpoint that the Russian Federation\r\nis evaluating the United Nations reforms launched by the\r\nSecretary-General, intended, as we see it, to rationally\r\nadapt United Nations mechanisms to today’s needs. We\r\nsupport the carrying out of reforms that will promote\r\neffective consolidation of the entire Organization and help\r\nimprove its efficiency in addressing urgent global\r\nchallenges.\r\nWe share the ideas expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the increasing importance of preventive\r\ndiplomacy. The international community has developed a\r\nunique arsenal of political and diplomatic tools which\r\nshould be used to resolve every international issue. This\r\narsenal must be put to effective use.\r\nThe fact that the Iraqi crisis earlier this year was\r\nsettled precisely by political means, through the joint\r\nefforts of many States, and through the initiatives\r\nlaunched by the Secretary-General, provided graphic\r\nevidence that constructive and active diplomacy can be\r\nfar more efficient than exclusive reliance on military\r\nforce.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposals on stepped-up\r\ncooperation between the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council —\r\nincluding through the invigoration of Article 65 of the\r\nCharter, dealing with cooperation between the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Security Council — as well as\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and Member\r\nStates in the area of preventive diplomacy, merit support.\r\nPeacekeeping operations remain a key instrument for\r\nresolving conflicts and crisis situations after all means of\r\npreventive diplomacy have been exhausted. We believe\r\nthat the main principles and criteria governing\r\npeacekeeping operations should include the existence of\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nan actual threat to international or regional peace and\r\nsecurity and a guarantee that the Security Council will play\r\na key part in settling all political issues relating to\r\noperations, first and foremost, issues relating to the possible\r\nuse of military force.\r\nWe call for the further consolidation of interaction\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations in\r\npeacekeeping activities, in conformity with Chapter VIII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter. At the same time, promotion of\r\nsuch cooperation should not serve to undermine the key\r\nrole of the United Nations in that highly important area. We\r\ndeem it necessary to continue to develop a concept of post-\r\nconflict peace-building. Development of parameters and\r\npractical guidelines for the rehabilitation of societies\r\ndestroyed by wars could give impetus to such a concept.\r\nSanctions as an instrument of international\r\nenforcement require a highly balanced approach. We fully\r\nshare this point of view with the Secretary-General. When\r\nintroduced by the Security Council, sanctions should not\r\nbecome a tool to fight a regime simply because it is\r\ndisliked. It is necessary to have clarity of goals every time\r\nsanctions are introduced and to agree well in advance upon\r\nclearly defined conditions and mechanisms for their lifting\r\nand possible gradual easing. Sanctions should not make\r\npeople suffer. They should not destabilize the economic\r\nsituation either in a country subject to them or in the\r\nsurrounding region.\r\nWe welcome the attempt made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to define the United Nations role in addressing\r\nsocial and economic problems related to the current phase\r\nof globalization and its consequences, both positive and\r\nnegative. Nowadays, it is clear to everybody that we cannot\r\nrely exclusively on market elements. There is a need for\r\nadequate mechanisms that would reasonably regulate\r\nfinancial and economic processes at a national and\r\ninternational level.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the United Nations has\r\ntaken the lead over the last year in outlining approaches to\r\nresolving arising problems in the following ways: a high-\r\nlevel meeting held by the United Nations and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions within the framework of the Economic\r\nand Social Council; a dialogue between Government\r\nofficials, members of the business community and\r\nrepresentatives of civil society on the role played by\r\nindustry in ensuring sustainable development, as was first\r\ninitiated within the framework of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development (CSD); and high-level meetings\r\nheld in order to resume a dialogue on international\r\neconomic cooperation for development through partnership.\r\nThe closer we get to the Millennium Assembly, the\r\nmore pressing becomes the issue of formulating the key\r\ntopics that the Assembly will discuss. It is obvious that\r\nunder conditions of a new phase of the global financial\r\ncrisis, that forum must focus on how to work out the\r\nways of overcoming the consequences of the crisis and\r\npreventing new setbacks.\r\nAmong our main priorities is human rights, which\r\nshould become a unifying source for international\r\ncooperation based on equal rights. The formation of such\r\ncooperation in the interest of security, democracy and\r\ndevelopment depends on the ability and readiness of the\r\ninternational community to overcome double standards,\r\nconsiderations of political expediency and selective\r\napproaches. The sooner such approaches are implemented,\r\nthe faster we will manage to dispel the illusion,\r\nmentioned in the Secretary-General’s report, that the\r\ninterests of the majority can be served by violating the\r\nrights of the minority. The international community\r\nshould not put up with the fact that nowadays those\r\ndangerous illusions serve as a basis for State policies in\r\nsome parts of the world.\r\nWe are concerned that, due to the lack of financial\r\nresources, according to the report’s conclusion, some vital\r\noperations of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will have to be\r\nscaled down or even, in some cases, suspended. For\r\nRussia, as well as for other Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS) countries, the humanitarian\r\nimperative is to implement accurately and consistently the\r\ndecisions of the Geneva regional conference on\r\naddressing the problems of refugees in the former of the\r\nrepublics of the Soviet Union. We believe that not only\r\nthe Geneva conference itself but also its follow-up\r\nactivities should set an example of international\r\ncooperation to resolve acute humanitarian problems.\r\nWe fully share the thesis contained in the report that\r\nthe international order must be based on international law.\r\nThis is fully concordant with the pivotal idea of the need\r\nfor “invoking the force of law rather than the law of\r\nforce” (A/53/PV.9), as expressed by Mr. Igor S. Ivanov,\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Russia to the General\r\nAssembly at this session’s general debate. The finalization\r\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court Statute\r\nis a considerable step in that direction.\r\nWe support the further intensification of collective\r\nefforts under the aegis of the United Nations, as the\r\nSecretary-General rightly recommends in his report, to\r\ncounteract the transnationalization of uncivil elements of\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nsociety — first and foremost, illegal drugs, organized crime\r\nand terrorism. Maximum efforts must be made to\r\nimplement relevant decisions adopted at the special session\r\nof the General Assembly in order to stand up to the drugs\r\nthreat. We hope that at the present session the General\r\nAssembly will manage to adopt the draft international\r\nconvention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism,\r\nintroduced by our country. The constructive progress of\r\nwork on the draft convention against organized\r\ntransnational crime also gives rise to optimism.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the introduction of\r\ninstitutional reforms in the United Nations system’s\r\nactivities has been successfully initiated. We believe that\r\nthe consistent and pragmatic implementation of the entire\r\nset of reforms launched by the Secretary-General will\r\nfurther increase the efficiency of the Organization’s work,\r\nparticularly of its Secretariat, the working structure that\r\nplays an important role in the everyday, practical activities\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn this regard, the Russian delegation counts on a\r\nfruitful and detailed exchange of views at this session on\r\nthe whole array of issues related to the reform of the\r\nOrganization’s personnel policy, which has long been\r\noverdue.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish once again to voice concern,\r\nclearly enunciated by the Secretary-General, over the\r\nUnited Nations financial situation. The perpetuation of the\r\nOrganization’s overly protracted financial crisis not only\r\nthreatens the implementation of current mandates and\r\nprogrammes approved by all Member States, but also\r\nundermines the role and authority of the Organization in the\r\ninternational arena.\r\nIn general, the Secretary-General’s report clearly\r\nshows that our Organization has the potential and\r\nmachinery necessary to continue playing its unique role in\r\ncoordinating the joint efforts of Member States to\r\nstrengthen peace and security, meet the new challenges to\r\nhumanity at the turn of the millennium, and advance\r\ntowards the new horizons of multilateral cooperation.\r\nMr. Shen Guofang (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): At the outset, allow me to convey the Chinese\r\ndelegation’s gratitude to the Secretary-General for the\r\nannual report he has prepared on the work of the\r\nOrganization. The Chinese delegation has read the report\r\nfrom cover to cover. I take this opportunity to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the untiring efforts he has made in\r\nthe past year in carrying out the tasks this Organization has\r\nentrusted to him and in enhancing the role of the United\r\nNations. We also appreciate the important role he played\r\nin the crisis early this year surrounding the inspection of\r\nIraqi weapons, in the facilitation of the settlement of\r\nregional conflicts in Africa, in the promotion of the\r\nreform of the United Nations system and in many other\r\nfields.\r\nThe international situation, generally speaking, has\r\nremained stable over the past year, but new regional\r\nconflicts have surfaced frequently. The Secretary-General\r\npoints out in his report that new challenges have\r\ncontinuously emerged in the political, economic, financial,\r\nsecurity and other fields. We believe that peace and\r\ndevelopment, the two major themes of today’s world,\r\nshould be the central tasks of the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nOver the past year, the United Nations has continued\r\nto play an active role in maintaining world peace and\r\nsecurity. While committed to the resolution of conflicts,\r\nthe Organization has also paid much attention to\r\nexploring and resolving their root causes. A good case in\r\npoint in this connection were the two Security Council\r\nmeetings at the level of Foreign Minister on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa. Progress has also been\r\nmade in the disarmament field.\r\nVery disturbingly, however, the nuclear tests this\r\nyear and the regional arms race in South Asia have posed\r\nserious challenges to the peace and security of that region\r\nand the world at large. We fully endorse the view\r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General in his report that the\r\nUnited Nations should continue to work, together with the\r\ninternational community, to facilitate the implementation\r\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions, safeguard the\r\ninternational nuclear non-proliferation regime and\r\nmaintain the peace, security and stability of South Asia\r\nand the world as a whole.\r\nAlthough developing countries have emphasized time\r\nand again that the question of development should be top\r\npriority, it worries us to see that the core resources for\r\nUnited Nations operational activities are decreasing. As\r\nthe Secretary-General points out in his report, official\r\ndevelopment assistance around the globe has dropped to\r\nan all-time low, now standing at only 0.22 per cent of the\r\ngross national product of developed countries and a mere\r\n0.19 per cent for the seven most developed. We cannot\r\nhelp but be concerned at this development. We hope that\r\nall developed countries will show their due sense of\r\nresponsibility on the question of financing, implement the\r\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions in real earnest, and\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 27th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 5 October 1998\r\nreach the agreed targets on the issue of voluntary\r\ncontributions as soon as possible.\r\nThe elimination of poverty is a major task facing most\r\ndeveloping countries. We appreciate the fact that\r\ninstitutions within the United Nations system have made the\r\nelimination of poverty a shared goal for inter-institutional\r\ncoordination. The efforts of the United Nations in helping\r\nthe developing countries to achieve sustainable development\r\nare also commendable. In the new circumstances, the\r\nUnited Nations should work even harder to solve the\r\nproblems facing developing countries, especially in the\r\nfields of boosting investment and growth, addressing the\r\nchallenges of globalization, making the necessary\r\nreadjustments and avoiding the eruption of economic and\r\nsocial crises. All these efforts can, as a matter of fact, be\r\ncalled the preventive diplomacy that we often talk about.\r\nThey can also help eradicate the root cause of regional\r\nconflicts.\r\nOver the past year, the United Nations has also made\r\nprogress in the field of human rights. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has actively supported and participated in the\r\nUnited Nations activities in this field and is gradually\r\naccelerating the process of improving its democracy and\r\nrule of law. Not long ago, Mrs. Robinson, the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, paid a\r\nsuccessful visit to China. She is satisfied with the progress\r\nChina has made in the area of human rights and grateful for\r\nChina’s support for the United Nations work in this field.\r\nIn October last year, China signed the International\r\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This\r\nmorning, China signed the International Covenant on\r\nCivil and Political Rights. This demonstrates the Chinese\r\nGovernment’s important support for the United Nations\r\nwork in human rights.\r\nThe financial crisis of the United Nations is yet\r\nanother urgent matter that warrants our concern. It has\r\ndeteriorated further over the past year. This problem has\r\nnot only seriously affected the daily operations of the\r\nUnited Nations, but also hindered the deepening of its\r\nreform. The definitive solution is for the major\r\ncontributor in particular to move quickly to pay its\r\narrears, in full and without condition. No State Member\r\nof the United Nations has any excuse to shirk from its\r\nresponsibilities to the Organization.\r\nThe times demand and the general membership of\r\nthe Organization as a whole aspires to the reasonable and\r\nappropriate reform of the United Nations. Over the past\r\nyear, the General Assembly has adopted resolutions\r\nendorsing the Secretary-General’s reform measures in the\r\nSecretariat and has accepted some of his proposals for\r\nreforming the United Nations system. However, as was\r\npointed out by the Secretary-General himself, the adoption\r\nof these resolutions is not the end of the reform process,\r\nbut rather the starting point for Member States to explore\r\nthe direction of the reform of the United Nations. This\r\nsession of the General Assembly will, on the one hand,\r\nclosely follow the implementation of the reform measures\r\nalready adopted and, on the other, continue to consider\r\nsome long-term reform proposals put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General. The Chinese delegation hopes that an\r\nearnest and thorough study of the proposals will be\r\nconducted on the basis of open and wide-ranging\r\ndiscussions.\r\nThe United Nations has made an extraordinary\r\njourney over more than half a century. As the most\r\nimportant intergovernmental organization in the world, it\r\nhas unique and indispensable roles on the international\r\npolitical and economic scenes. The Chinese delegation\r\nhopes that the debate on the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe work of the Organization will help Member States\r\nbetter to summarize the lessons and experiences of that\r\nwork further to improve the Organization’s efficiency and\r\ndefine its major tasks, so that it can enter the twenty-first\r\ncentury with a new look and make new contributions to\r\nthe maintenance of peace and the promotion of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
