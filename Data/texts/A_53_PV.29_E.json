(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Festus Mogae, President of the\r\nRepublic of Botswana\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will first hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of Botswana.\r\nMr. Festus Mogae, President of the Republic of\r\nBotswana, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of Botswana, His Excellency Mr. Festus Mogae,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mogae: Mr. President, allow me at the\r\noutset to express great pleasure at seeing you preside over\r\nthe work of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are confident that under your able leadership the work\r\nof this session will be an unmitigated success. I can assure\r\nyou of the cooperation and support of my country’s\r\ndelegation throughout your stewardship of this session.\r\nAllow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to our\r\nindefatigable Secretary-General and his staff for the efforts\r\nthey are making, often under very trying conditions, to give\r\nmeaning and concrete expression to the lofty ideals\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. They\r\ndeserve the full support and cooperation of all Member\r\nStates and their peoples.\r\nAs we approach the next millennium, we are fully\r\nconscious of the omnipresence of war and of the havoc it\r\ncontinues to wreak upon peoples in literally every\r\ncontinent of the world. It is true that local wars have so\r\nfar not posed a serious threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity, but by some accounts they have already killed\r\nand maimed more people than both world wars combined.\r\nAnd judging by the number of those who are killed in\r\nthem and other attendant consequences, these wars,\r\nwhatever their cause, are a living reality for those who\r\nfight in them and for the innocent people who are caught\r\nin the cross-fire. The conclusion we can draw is that not\r\nall succeeding generations of humankind have been\r\nspared the scourge of war in accordance with the promise\r\nmade over 50 years ago by the founding fathers of this\r\nOrganization. In terms of human history, 50 years is a\r\nrelatively short time. It is, however, long enough to make\r\nthe judgement that present-day human beings, like their\r\npredecessors in history, have failed to unlearn the ways of\r\nwar — or rather to acquire the skills to live with one\r\nanother like good neighbours.\r\nThe presence of war and conflict among and within\r\nnations has often drawn a great deal of criticism to the\r\nUnited Nations, as if it had a magic wand to resolve\r\nevery problem brought to its doorstep. True, there is room\r\nfor improvement in the performance and efficacy of the\r\nUnited Nations. Certainly, the genocide in Rwanda in\r\n1994 could have been avoided with more determination\r\nand foresight.\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nUnfortunately, in awarding themselves certain\r\nextraordinary powers, the framers of the Charter built\r\ncertain imperfections into the Organization which have\r\nproven to be serious encumbrances to its efficiency and\r\neffectiveness on conflict resolution. So long as this\r\nOrganization remains the creation of the nation-State\r\nsystem with its in-built self-interest, it cannot be expected\r\nto perform differently. But we can certainly improve its\r\ndelivery system to acceptable levels. Notwithstanding the\r\nimperfections of the United Nations, its continued existence\r\nis in the national interest of all Member States, whatever\r\ntheir claims to the contrary. Otherwise, Member States\r\nwhich felt they benefitted the least would long since have\r\nwithdrawn their membership. Member States should\r\ntherefore commit themselves to the payment of their\r\ncontributions to the budget of the United Nations when they\r\nfall due, without any conditions.\r\nIdeally, the United Nations should have developed\r\nmachinery to address and avert conflict situations before\r\nthey actually occur. However, in the world in which we\r\nlive, the ideal and the real do not often dovetail. Preventive\r\ndiplomacy should quickly be succeeded by robust\r\npeacekeeping as soon as it is determined that a conflict\r\nsituation is not amenable to resolution through dialogue.\r\nPreventive deployment has been put to use successfully in\r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the\r\nseparation of belligerent forces has also been put to\r\nsuccessful use to contain the otherwise explosive situations\r\nin Cyprus and Lebanon.\r\nThe African experience in peacekeeping has been\r\nslightly different. In most cases, conflicts have smouldered\r\nand festered to calamitous proportions on our continent as\r\na result of international inertia — or should we call it\r\n“Africa fatigue”? Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Great Lakes\r\nregion and other cases are illustrative in this regard. African\r\nStates are ready and willing to bear their fair share of\r\npeacekeeping operations on the continent, but they are\r\ncertainly lacking in logistic and financial wherewithal.\r\nWhile there is ample scope for improvement in African\r\npeacekeeping capacity, Africa has over the years acquired\r\npractical experience both in the field and through\r\ncooperation with other countries. Thus, Africa has a\r\nrelatively sophisticated capacity to carry out peacekeeping\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nI must admit that it hurts my pride as an African to\r\nhear that African conflict situations dominate the agenda of\r\nthe Security Council. This is a dubious honour, if indeed it\r\nis an honour at all. It must, however, be acknowledged that\r\nAfrican problems are problems of the international\r\ncommunity. They are problems of the United Nations,\r\nwhose Charter is categorical in allocating primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. That responsibility was bestowed in trust. It\r\ncannot be shirked for political expediency in any part of\r\nthe world. African conflicts deserve equal attention by\r\nthis Organization, to which all African States belong and\r\npay their dues, however modest. They cannot be left to\r\nthe Africans alone to resolve.\r\nIf I have devoted a great part of my address to the\r\nrole of the United Nations in crisis management and in\r\nthe defusing of tensions, it is not because I am oblivious\r\nto other equally pressing issues of our times. Crises and\r\ntensions, by their very nature, presuppose a lack of\r\nsecurity, movement of people and, very often, deep-rooted\r\nintolerance. Evidently, when people raise swords against\r\ntheir neighbours, the humanness that is innate in all\r\npeople is replaced by the bestiality that lies latent in every\r\nperson. It is incomprehensible how the perpetrators of\r\nacts of genocide and other serious crimes against\r\nhumanity manage to live with their consciences or to lead\r\nnormal lives after such heinous criminal activities.\r\nThe establishment last summer of the International\r\nCriminal Court will, we hope, help to ensure that\r\nperpetrators of acts of genocide, crimes against humanity\r\nand other inhuman acts will not go unpunished. The\r\nInternational Criminal Court will also, we hope, act as a\r\ndeterrent for those intending to commit such serious\r\ncrimes. The conviction by the Rwanda Tribunal of two\r\nleading personalities involved in acts of genocide in\r\nRwanda in 1994 has also served notice to would-be\r\nperpetrators of similar acts that the international\r\ncommunity can no longer tolerate their diabolical acts.\r\nHuman rights abuse is equally intolerable and\r\nimmoral. Institutions dealing with human rights should be\r\nempowered to deal with the perpetrators of human rights\r\nabuses with the full force of the law. Human rights abuse\r\nhas been responsible for the bulk of the horrendous\r\nconflicts that have ravaged societies in all continents\r\nthroughout this violent century. We therefore could not\r\nagree more with the Secretary-General when he says in\r\nhis annual report on the work of the Organization,\r\n“If individual rights are not protected, the whole of\r\nsociety suffers. Personal freedoms are however\r\nrendered largely meaningless by civil wars, or by\r\neconomic, social or cultural deprivation — often,\r\nindeed, by a combination of all these”. (A/53/1,\r\npara. 171)\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nTherefore, in this, the year of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the\r\ncommunity of civilized nations to which we all belong must\r\nreaffirm its commitment to the human rights ideals\r\nenshrined in the Declaration and to their determination to\r\nlive up to those ideals.\r\nGlobalization and economic liberalization have brought\r\nabout unprecedented expansion in world trade and\r\ncommerce, but they have also accentuated the imbalances\r\nin international economic relations. The vast majority of\r\ncountries, particularly in Africa, continue to face\r\nmarginalization in the world economy. The problem is\r\nfurther compounded by the fact that official development\r\nassistance has fallen to unprecedentedly low levels.\r\nIn Africa, armed conflicts have impacted negatively on\r\ndevelopment prospects. Corruption has also been one of the\r\nbiggest obstacles to development. There is, however, reason\r\nfor optimism. The majority of African countries have\r\ninstituted reforms to achieve economic growth and\r\ndevelopment, including the application of sound\r\nmacroeconomic policies, good governance, the rule of law\r\nand respect for human rights. They have taken serious\r\nmeasures to introduce budgetary reforms, remove\r\nrestrictions on current payments and restrain credit and\r\nmonetary expansion. Over the past few years Africa’s\r\neconomic performance has been on an upward trend. In\r\n1997 close to 60 per cent of the African countries\r\nregistered growth rates in excess of their population growth\r\nrates, and about half of this number posted annual\r\neconomic growth rates of more than 5 per cent.\r\nAfrica, however, still needs active support and\r\nassistance from the international community. We clearly\r\nrecognize that it is the primary responsibility of the\r\nAfricans themselves to reduce the marginalization of their\r\ncontinent from the world economy. But for Africa to\r\nachieve any tangible success and emerge from the\r\nconditions of poverty and underdevelopment a new type of\r\npartnership with the developed world is required to increase\r\ntrade and the continent’s share of global prosperity. African\r\ncountries need improved access to world markets, greater\r\nflow of foreign direct investment, technology transfer and\r\nan increase in official development assistance.\r\nThe decline in official development assistance needs\r\nto be reversed. Similarly, external debt is a problem\r\nrequiring urgent attention. In fact, the debt burden continues\r\nto be one of the main obstacles to economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. The new initiative adopted by the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions to reduce the multilateral debt of the\r\nheavily indebted poor countries is a welcome\r\ndevelopment, though its implementation has been very\r\ndisappointing and painfully slow. Botswana believes that\r\nthe only viable solution to the debt problem faced by the\r\npoorest countries is outright cancellation of the debt.\r\nThe main objectives of Botswana’s development\r\nstrategy are employment creation and poverty alleviation.\r\nLack of income is the most immediate cause of poverty\r\namong our people. Employment opportunities have\r\nincreased significantly in the last few years, but the rate\r\nof unemployment is still unacceptably high. To improve\r\nthe situation, Botswana has over the past few years\r\nundertaken measures to create a favourable environment\r\nfor investment, including the encouragement of small and\r\nmedium-scale enterprises. I am confident that with the\r\nsupport of our development partners our efforts will bear\r\nfruit.\r\nBefore I conclude my statement, let me say a few\r\nwords about recent events in southern Africa. On 16\r\nSeptember 1998 there was an attempt to put an end to the\r\nconstitutional order in the Kingdom of Lesotho by\r\noverthrowing a democratically elected Government. Junior\r\nofficers in the Lesotho Defence Force mutinied and\r\narrested their senior officers, including the army\r\ncommander. Government employees, including Cabinet\r\nMinisters, were stopped from going to work, which\r\nresulted in a complete collapse of the administrative order\r\nin the country. Criminal activity and lawlessness became\r\nthe order of the day. There was no doubt that Lesotho\r\nwas on the brink of widespread violence and total chaos.\r\nThe crisis was most alarming because of its wider\r\nimplications for peace and stability in the whole\r\nsubregion of southern Africa. No effort was made by\r\nthose involved to heed the calls for peaceful dialogue.\r\nUnder the circumstances, the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) could not remain\r\nindifferent. Therefore, on 21 September 1998 members of\r\nthe Botswana Defence Force and the South African\r\nDefence Forces entered the Kingdom of Lesotho in\r\nresponse to an appeal for such intervention by the\r\ndemocratically elected Government of Lesotho. The\r\nintervention is aimed at assisting the people of Lesotho to\r\ncreate conditions conducive for them to address their\r\ndifferences in a peaceful manner. Our action conforms\r\nstrictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, as well as the resolution of the 1997\r\nHarare summit of the Organization of African Unity\r\nwhich condemns the overthrow of legitimate Governments\r\nby the military.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nI wish to assure the Assembly that the military\r\nintervention by Botswana and South Africa in Lesotho is\r\nmotivated solely by a sincere will to establish conditions of\r\npeace and security in our sister country. We are dealing\r\nwith a difficult, complex and rapidly changing situation. As\r\nsuch, our forces shall remain in Lesotho for as long as\r\nnecessary to restore public order and the rule of law.\r\nWith regard to Angola, it has become increasingly\r\nclear that the leader of UNITA has no intention that it shall\r\nmeet its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol. Given the\r\nrenewed upsurge in violence caused by UNITA, SADC has\r\ncome to the conclusion, regretfully, that Mr. Savimbi must\r\nbe held personally responsible for war crimes that his\r\nmovement has committed, and continues to commit even\r\nafter it has signed a peace agreement. The people of Angola\r\nhave suffered for far too long and it is time that this\r\nfratricidal war, which has devastated the country, was\r\nbrought to an end.\r\nAcross the border from war-weary Angola, another\r\nSADC country is going through a painful process of\r\nnational rebirth, rudely interrupted two months ago by a\r\nrebellion which, even as we meet here, is ineluctably\r\nsapping the residual energy of a devastated country. The\r\npeople of the Democratic Republic of the Congo deserve a\r\nbreak. Through the timely assistance rendered by three\r\nSADC countries at a time of great peril, it is our fervent\r\nhope that the Democratic Republic of the Congo will soon\r\nresume its process of rebirth and do so in peace and\r\ntranquillity.\r\nLet me conclude by assuring you, Mr. President, and\r\nthe nations gathered here that Botswana’s faith in the\r\nUnited Nations as the universal repository of the hopes and\r\naspirations of all mankind remains as strong as ever. We\r\nwill continue to work assiduously for the enhancement of\r\nthe efficacy of the Organization, to help equip it for the\r\narduous tasks that lie ahead.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Festus Mogae, President of the Republic of\r\nBotswana, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 85\r\nComprehensive review of the whole question of\r\npeacekeeping operations in all their aspects\r\nCommemorative meeting marking the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of United Nations peacekeeping\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.5)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nGeneral Assembly will now hold the commemorative\r\nmeeting marking the fiftieth anniversary of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations, in accordance with the\r\ndecision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting, and pursuant to\r\nAssembly resolution 52/69 of 10 December 1997.\r\nI am greatly honoured and deeply satisfied to preside\r\nover this ceremony commemorating 50 years of\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nThis is much more than a pro forma exercise. It\r\nrepresents the feeling that inspires us all when we\r\ncontemplate the important role these operations have\r\nplayed in our quest for international peace and security.\r\nEqually important, this occasion should be a time for\r\nreflecting on the present and future of this kind of United\r\nNations intervention.\r\nPeacekeeping operations range from monitoring\r\nelections to the verification of respect for human rights,\r\nas well as measures to re-establish institutions, when\r\nnecessary, and restore services affected by war, violence\r\nand instability.\r\nHundreds of thousands of troops from many\r\ndifferent States have participated in 49 such operations,\r\non every continent, since 1948, and more than a thousand\r\nmilitary and civilian personnel — including, in 1961, the\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization himself, Dag\r\nHammarskjöld — have lost their lives. All of this proves\r\nthat there are many special aspects of the commemoration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary, which is a milestone in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations.\r\nNaturally, a great deal has been said and written\r\nabout the legal nature and status of peacekeeping\r\noperations, and the doctrinal and political debate\r\ncontinues in the light of the new forms that these\r\noperations are assuming.\r\nAt first, interposition by military units and civilian\r\nobservers under the auspices of the Organization, and at\r\nthe request of the States involved, in order to quell or\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nlimit hostile actions, verify compliance with ceasefire\r\nagreements or contribute, as an impartial observer, to\r\npossible negotiations was accepted as a legitimate\r\nimplementation of the letter and spirit of Chapter VI of the\r\nCharter. This was so even when the use of troops armed\r\nwith light weapons introduced a modality not unlike the\r\nmeasures provided for in Chapter VII, a situation that\r\ninspired Dag Hammarskjöld to say, in a felicitous turn of\r\nphrase, that peacekeeping operations came under “Chapter\r\nVI and a half” of the Charter.\r\nDuring the cold war, on the basis of the conceptual\r\nframework I have described, a number of peacekeeping\r\noperations were established that helped to ward off more\r\nthan a few conflicts that threatened international peace and\r\nsecurity. The universality implicit in the composition of\r\nthese operations lessened national sensitivities and even\r\nlimited the concept of State sovereignty, while facilitating\r\ndialogue and negotiations between the parties involved.\r\nThe end of the bipolar international order created a\r\nproliferation of localized armed confrontations of diverse\r\nand complex origin, which presented the United Nations\r\nwith new and difficult challenges. Many internal conflicts,\r\nwhich generally also had international implications, were\r\naccompanied by grave threats to human rights and by\r\ncatastrophic emergency situations. These conflicts occurred\r\nat a time when the United Nations was reaffirming its\r\ncommitment to safeguard these fundamental values.\r\nIt was then, at the end of the 1980s — and it is worth\r\nnoting that in 1988 the United Nations received the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize — that the Member States authorized and\r\nencouraged the implementation of new forms of\r\npeacekeeping operations, later formalized by the Security\r\nCouncil, following the guidelines in the Secretary-General’s\r\nAgenda for Peace, in 1992. These changes included an\r\nemphasis on preventive diplomacy and the deployment of\r\ntroops before hostilities. Thus, 36 of the 49 peacekeeping\r\noperations undertaken by the United Nations were\r\norganized between 1989 and 1998. However, these figures\r\ndo not in themselves illustrate the qualitative element of\r\nthese operations.\r\nFirst of all, we saw an extension of the field of\r\napplication of peacekeeping operations to certain internal\r\nconflicts: the parties’ consent was no longer essential and\r\nthe mandates of the operations were considerably broadened\r\nto include a number of political, institutional and\r\nadministrative aspects of the States or parties involved. In\r\ngeneral, the golden rule of not opening fire except in self-\r\ndefence was made more flexible, by force of circumstance,\r\nto meet the need to protect displaced and suffering\r\ncivilian populations or to ensure their survival through the\r\ndelivery of emergency supplies.\r\nAlso noteworthy has been the growing intervention\r\nof coalitions, acting with the support of the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as action taken by regional organizations\r\npursuant to the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter.\r\nA number of failures in peacekeeping operations\r\nhave given rise to criticism. It has been pointed out that\r\nthere is a need to establish more precise mandates, to\r\ndefine frameworks for action more clearly, and to provide\r\nthe operations with sufficient means and resources. This\r\npremise makes it essential for Member States to meet\r\ntheir financial obligations fully and on time.\r\nOn a more general and substantive plane, many\r\ncountries still have reservations about the growing\r\ntendency to have recourse to peacekeeping operations and\r\nabout the expansion of their mandates. These countries\r\ninvoke the fundamental principle, enshrined in Article 2,\r\nparagraph 7 of the Charter, prohibiting intervention in the\r\ninternal affairs of States.\r\nThe truth, however, is that, beyond the reasonable\r\ncaution that should govern the administration of\r\npeacekeeping operations — which, after 50 years, may be\r\nconsidered an essential institution in the functioning of\r\nthe United Nations — there is a clear consensus that they\r\nshould be strengthened as an effective tool for\r\nmaintaining peace and contributing to the ideal of a world\r\nin which human rights are respected and the universal\r\nduty of humanitarian assistance prevails.\r\nThe Member States whose representatives are\r\ngathered here understand that peace and the values I have\r\njust mentioned are the very raison d’être of the United\r\nNations. On their behalf, it is my duty as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to recognize the pioneers of the\r\npeacekeeping operations and to pay sincere homage to all\r\nthe participants, many of whom are represented here. I\r\nalso wish to voice our satisfaction at the excellent work\r\nof the Secretariat in this respect and to pay a heartfelt\r\ntribute to the memory of the heroic officials, soldiers and\r\ncivilians — including some from my country — who paid\r\nwith their lives because we, the peoples, were determined\r\nto achieve a better world based on peace and justice.\r\nThese ideas and feelings are, in my opinion, fully\r\nreflected in the text of the Declaration. I should like to\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nrecommend that it be adopted by acclamation. I now give\r\nthe floor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Today it is my great honour\r\nto commemorate with the Assembly the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof United Nations peacekeeping — the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the year when soldiers were sent onto the battlefield\r\nunder a new flag, with a new mission: a mission of peace.\r\nIt would be no exaggeration to say that that mission\r\nwas without precedent in human history. It was an attempt\r\nto confront and defeat the worst in man with the best in\r\nman; to counter violence with tolerance, might with\r\nmoderation and war with peace.\r\nThat mission has earned its place in history as the first\r\nexample of what has come to be known as peacekeeping.\r\nEver since then, day after day, year after year, United\r\nNations peacekeepers have been meeting the threat and\r\nreality of conflict, without losing faith, without giving in\r\nand without giving up.\r\nSince 1948, there have been 49 United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. Thirty-six of those have been\r\ncreated since 1988, the year in which United Nations\r\npeacekeeping was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Well\r\nover 750,000 military and civilian police personnel, and\r\nthousands of other civilians, from 118 different countries,\r\nhave served in United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nFourteen thousand peacekeepers are serving this very day.\r\nNo figures, however, can do justice to the ultimate\r\nsacrifice that more than 1,500 peacekeepers have made over\r\nthis half-century. Today we pay tribute, above all, to the\r\nbrave Blue Helmets who gave their lives in the cause of\r\npeace. Whatever success we have had is owed to their\r\nsacrifice, their dedication and their heroism.\r\nI am grateful and particularly honoured to announce\r\nthat later today I shall bestow on three of our fallen\r\npeacekeepers, in the presence of their families, a new\r\nMedal named after one of them: Secretary-General Dag\r\nHammarskjöld.\r\nThe United Nations, forged from the battles of two\r\nworld wars, was dedicated, above all, to the pursuit of\r\npeace and, in the enduring words of the Charter, to saving\r\n“succeeding generations from the scourge of war”.\r\nUndoubtedly, peacekeeping falls fairly and squarely within\r\nthe spirit of that pledge. Yet you will search in vain in the\r\nCharter for any specific provision for such operations.\r\nPeacekeeping, from the start, has been an\r\nimprovisation. To my mind, that is one of its great merits.\r\nIt proved, and continues to prove, that the United Nations\r\nis not a static or hidebound Organization, but a dynamic\r\nand innovative one. Indeed, peacekeeping has been one of\r\nmany activities through which the United Nations has\r\nshown its ability to adapt to circumstances, to find its way\r\naround obstacles and to make itself relevant to the actual\r\nproblems at hand.\r\nNot that the evolution of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping — from patrolling clearly marked buffer\r\nzones and ceasefire lines to the far more complex,\r\nmultidimensional operations of the 1990s — has been\r\neither smooth or simple. Often the expectations placed on\r\npeacekeepers have outstripped the resources given to\r\nthem. Often the demands made of them have cruelly\r\nignored the realities on the ground.\r\nOver the decades, we have had some unmistakable\r\nsuccesses, such as Namibia, Mozambique and El\r\nSalvador. We have also found ourselves maintaining calm\r\nin some seemingly intractable stalemates, such as Cyprus\r\nand the Middle East. In some places — Rwanda and the\r\nformer Yugoslavia — we have found ourselves standing\r\nby, in impotent horror, while the most appalling crimes\r\nwere committed. There the limits of peacekeeping were\r\ngraphically demonstrated. We learned, the hard way, that\r\nlightly armed troops in white vehicles and blue helmets\r\nare not the solution for every conflict. Sometimes peace\r\nhas to be made — or enforced — before it can be kept.\r\nWe yield to no one in our regret and our pain over\r\nthose calamities: the loss of life, the wanton destruction\r\nof towns and villages, the shredding of the very fabric of\r\nhumanity which, in normal times and places, allows men\r\nand women of different ethnic origin to live peacefully\r\nside by side. We will for ever measure our proudest\r\nachievements against the memory of those worst days.\r\nBut that does not mean we succumb to the fatalism\r\nof those who would rather stay at home when conflict\r\nrages and fellow human beings are suffering in a distant\r\nland. That is the cynic’s answer, and that is the coward’s\r\nsolution. It is not ours.\r\nWe are not here today to declare victory. We cannot\r\nclaim that peacekeeping has been the answer to every\r\nconflict; still less, alas, that it has prevented the\r\nrecurrence of genocide. What we can and do claim\r\nproudly is that, in the first half century of their existence,\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nUnited Nations Blue Helmets have saved tens of thousands\r\nof lives.\r\nIn recent times the pendulum may appear to have\r\nswung away from the support of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping. But I have no doubt that history will see it\r\nas one of the Organization’s most important and lasting\r\ncontributions to international peace and security.\r\nThe mission of United Nations peacekeeping must\r\ncontinue. Too much remains to be done; too many\r\ninnocents are dying even as we speak, for us to think of\r\nleaving the field now.\r\nPeacekeeping’s promise, after all, was never to end\r\nwar. Peacekeeping is not the same as peacemaking. It can\r\nhelp prevent, or at least delay, recurrence of conflict. It can\r\nbe used, as we have shown in the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, to help prevent conflict from\r\nbreaking out in the first place. Above all, it gives time and\r\nspace for conflict resolution: it gives peace a chance. If the\r\nchance is not taken, the peacemakers are not to blame.\r\nIsaiah’s words,\r\n“they shall beat their swords into ploughshares,\r\nand their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall\r\nnot lift up sword against nation, neither shall\r\nthey learn war any more”, (The Holy Bible,\r\nIsaiah 2:4)\r\nwill never be more than an ideal for humanity. If, in our\r\nservice as United Nations peacekeepers, we can help make\r\nthat ideal more true than false, more promising than distant,\r\nmore able to protect the innocent than embolden the guilty,\r\nwe will have done our part.\r\nThe will to peace must exist among the peoples and\r\nthe parties, but the path to peace is one that we, the United\r\nNations, can help pave. We have done so for the last 50\r\nyears, and I am confident we can continue to do so in the\r\ncoming century.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call on\r\nthe representative of Nepal, who will speak on behalf of the\r\nGroup of Asian States.\r\nMr. Shah (Nepal): On this solemn occasion marking\r\nthe commemoration of 50 years of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping, I should like to pay the tribute of the\r\nmember States of the Asian Group to the more than 1,500\r\npeacekeepers who have made the ultimate sacrifice of their\r\nlives in the service of the United Nations. They have\r\ndisplayed courage, idealism and motivation of the highest\r\norder.\r\nOur homage is also due to the thousands of other\r\npeacekeepers who have suffered physical disability while\r\nin the service of the Organization.\r\nOn behalf of the Asian Group, I would like to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the 14,500 military and civilian\r\npolice personnel who are currently serving the cause of\r\npeace in the 17 ongoing peacekeeping missions of the\r\nUnited Nations around the globe today.\r\nIt is my great honour, on behalf of the Asian Group,\r\nto welcome the presence in this Hall of the families of the\r\nfirst recipients of the newly instituted Dag Hammarskjöld\r\nMedal, the late Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld,\r\nCommandant René de Labarrière and Count Folke\r\nBernadotte — the martyrs of peace who have been and\r\nshall remain a source of inspiration.\r\nIt is also my honour to recognize the presence at this\r\ncommemorative meeting of former Secretary-General\r\nJavier Pérez de Cuéllar, former Under-Secretaries-\r\nGeneral, Assistant Secretaries-General, Special\r\nRepresentatives of the Secretary-General, Deputy Special\r\nRepresentatives, force commanders, chiefs of staff, chief\r\nmilitary observers, military advisers, civilian police\r\ncommissioners, Headquarters and field staff of the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, as well as of\r\nseveral former peacekeepers. To all of them, thousands of\r\nothers who could not be here and those who have already\r\nleft us, the Asian Group owes a debt of gratitude for a\r\njob well done.\r\nPeacekeeping is a unique United Nations concept\r\nunder which troops are deployed not for purposes of war,\r\nbut to provide a foundation for peace. In its primary role\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\npeacekeeping has been and will remain one of the\r\nessential tools of the United Nations. Fifty years after the\r\nmandating of the first peacekeeping operation,\r\npeacekeeping continues to be adapted to changing needs\r\nand is becoming increasingly multidimensional. We are\r\nsatisfied that efforts continue to strengthen the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations to respond rapidly to demands for\r\npeacekeeping and to improve the overall management of\r\npeacekeeping missions.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call on\r\nthe representative of Poland, who will speak on behalf of\r\nthe Group of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. Wyzner (Poland): It is indeed with a sense of\r\ngreat honour and pride that I take the floor today on behalf\r\nof the Group of Eastern European States — honour,\r\nbecause I am addressing the General Assembly convened\r\non the most solemn occasion: to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of United Nations peacekeeping; and pride,\r\nbecause the idea of adopting the declaration to pay special\r\ntribute to those who have been keeping peace all over the\r\nworld, at the request and on behalf of all the Members of\r\nthe United Nations, originated in the Group I am\r\nrepresenting today whose two members, Ukraine and\r\nPoland, authored the original draft declaration.\r\nThe initiative I am referring to was not put forward by\r\nmere chance. It emerged as a reflection of both the\r\ncommitment of the members of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States to the ideals enshrined in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, as well as the high measure of their\r\ncommitment to the Organization’s peacekeeping activities.\r\nThe members of our Group have consistently been\r\namong the leading troop contributors. Their national\r\ncontingents constitute today more than 12 per cent of the\r\ntotal military strength of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations and currently serve in all but two of them. One\r\nof the members of the Group, Poland, has for some time\r\nbeen the biggest United Nations troop contributor.\r\nOccasions like today’s call for reflection. Let me share\r\nsome with the General Assembly. It is important to realize\r\nhow indispensable United Nations peacekeeping has\r\nbecome in the course of 50 years of its history. Our\r\nOrganization’s mechanism for maintaining international\r\npeace and security would have been indeed incomplete and\r\nnot properly equipped had it not been for the peacekeepers’\r\nreadiness to answer a call of the Security Council.\r\nHaving turned 50 and accomplished so much since its\r\ninception, United Nations peacekeeping, in order to remain\r\nas relevant and useful as it has always been, is bound to\r\nfurther evolve. What we are dealing with today is\r\nsometimes quite distant from the original concept of\r\npeacekeeping. Contemporary operations tend to be highly\r\ncomplicated multidimensional undertakings, involving not\r\nonly military, but also civilian specialists, and are often\r\ncarried out in cooperation with regional organizations or\r\narrangements, humanitarian organizations and numerous\r\nother agencies. Their mandates include far more than\r\ntraditional peacekeeping alone. In fact, a distinct change\r\nseems to be under way, leading to wider participation of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping in post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding in all its variety.\r\nMuch remains to be done to prepare the Blue\r\nHelmets to shoulder this kind of responsibility and we all,\r\nMembers of the United Nations and its main bodies alike,\r\nhave our part of the task to fulfil. The 50 years of United\r\nNations peacekeeping provides us with a wealth of\r\nexperience to draw from. This experience is both positive\r\nand negative. The former does not necessarily give us\r\ncomplete guidance for operating in today’s frequently\r\nunusual circumstances; the latter, painful as it may be,\r\nshould never be forgotten while preparing future\r\noperations.\r\nIn this context, let me mention one particular issue\r\nwhich should be kept constantly at the centre of our\r\nattention: the safety and security of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping personnel. We strongly believe that\r\nmeasures must be taken to prevent vicious, deliberate\r\nassaults on the soldiers sent by the United Nations to\r\nassist others in containing and resolving conflicts and to\r\nprovide both military and civilian personnel with adequate\r\nprotection. One of these measures should be the early\r\nentry into force and universal acceptance of the\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel.\r\nThanks to the years of outstanding service and its\r\nunquestioned accomplishments, United Nations\r\npeacekeeping is known to millions of people throughout\r\nthe world. For many of them the very presence of soldiers\r\nwearing blue helmets generates hope and the conviction\r\nthat they are not being abandoned to war and atrocities.\r\nThree quarters of a million soldiers delegated by\r\ntheir respective Governments have been carrying out the\r\nmandates assigned to them by the Security Council.\r\nFifteen hundred and eighty-one of them have made the\r\nultimate sacrifice in our common endeavours to maintain\r\npeace and security. We bow our heads in tribute to their\r\nmemory.\r\nWe also pay tribute to all their comrades-in-arms\r\nwho are represented here by the group of former\r\npeacekeepers. Their service is highly appreciated. The\r\nhonours and prizes they have been awarded, including the\r\nNobel Peace Prize in 1988, have been richly deserved.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nLet me express our special gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his unique contribution and\r\nleadership both at the helm of this Organization and earlier\r\nas the head of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.\r\nIn conclusion, may I assure the whole General\r\nAssembly that the members of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States will do their utmost to further develop and\r\nstrengthen the United Nations peacekeeping potential, a\r\nprecious instrument at the disposal of the international\r\ncommunity in its quest for peace and security.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker is the representative of the Dominican Republic,\r\nwho will speak on behalf of the States of Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean.\r\nMs. Aguiar (Dominican Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): It is a great honour for me to speak on\r\nbehalf of the States of Latin America and the Caribbean on\r\nsuch a very special occasion for the United Nations, the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nOver the last 50 years, the countries of our region\r\nhave not remained indifferent to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping activities. We must highlight the fact that our\r\ncountries are participating in 12 of the 17 current\r\noperations. Some of our members, such as Argentina,\r\nBrazil, Colombia and Uruguay, have been contributing staff\r\nfor more than 40 years. The region I have the honour to\r\nrepresent has traditionally solved its differences through\r\npeaceful means. According to the Secretary-General’s 1998\r\nreport, the Organization currently has six peacekeeping\r\noperations deployed in Europe, four in the Middle East,\r\nfour in Africa, two in Asia and only one in Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean, the United Nations Civilian Police\r\nMission in Haiti. Thus, I am able to state that our region\r\nhas traditionally contributed more personnel than it has had\r\nto receive on its territory.\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean attach great\r\nimportance to all the processes, ranging from preventive\r\ndiplomacy to post-conflict peace-building. This is shown by\r\nthe fact that our participation in peacekeeping operations is\r\nnot limited to sending military and police troops. Mexico\r\nand Colombia belong to the Group of Friends of the\r\nSecretary-General for Guatemala, while Argentina, Chile\r\nand Venezuela belong to the Group of Friends of the\r\nSecretary-General for Haiti.\r\nIn terms of troop contributions, there is no\r\ndistinction between large and small countries. In fact, in\r\n1995 Uruguay contributed the largest number of troops\r\nfrom our region. The Caribbean Community countries\r\nshowed a spirit of solidarity in participating in the United\r\nNations operations in Haiti. Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nArgentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Guatemala,\r\nGuyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint\r\nLucia, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago all had a\r\npresence there. El Salvador, Ecuador and Cuba have\r\ncontributed to other missions, while Brazil figured\r\nprominently in the peacekeeping operation in Angola.\r\nBolivia and my own country have shown interest in\r\ncontributing troops in the near future.\r\nThe experience of Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nin peacekeeping operations is growing daily, not only in\r\nthe field but also through courses for troops and military\r\nobservers that are given in the regional training centre\r\nwhose headquarters is in Buenos Aires, and in other\r\nsimilar centres, such as the one in Montevideo. Often,\r\nthese courses enjoy the participation of staff from centres\r\nof other regions.\r\nThe United Nations, as an honest and neutral broker,\r\nremains an essential factor in peacekeeping and\r\nconfidence-building. To be effective, peace missions\r\nrequire the full consent and cooperation of the parties to\r\nthe conflict and must always remain impartial and have a\r\nclear mandate. But States must support these efforts by\r\nproviding qualified staff and the necessary financial\r\nresources. The United Nations can only be as effective as\r\nwe, the Member States, allow it to be.\r\nThe Security Council has been discharging its\r\nmission in the process of creating peacekeeping\r\noperations. Since 1994, there have been visible indications\r\nthat the Member States are working with a more\r\nharmonious approach as regards peacekeeping missions.\r\nGuidelines and parameters have been defined for the\r\ncreation or extension of operations. We must also\r\nrecognize that the degree of transparency has increased in\r\nthe Council and that consultations with contributing\r\ncountries have begun to take place. This wholesome\r\nprocess, which we approve of and welcome, is the\r\noutcome to a great extent of proposals originating in\r\ncountries of our region. In that context, I would like to\r\nrecall the words spoken by the Permanent Representative\r\nof Chile when those consultations with troop-contributing\r\ncountries were institutionalized:\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\n“Troop-contributing countries have the right to be\r\nheard by the Council, and this right must be\r\nrecognized de jure and not only de facto.”\r\nFifty years after the first deployment of Blue Helmets\r\nin the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, I\r\nwould like to conclude by voicing, on behalf of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, sincere appreciation and\r\nhomage to all the men and women who have given their\r\nlives in silent and humble service under the flag of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Christian holy book says,\r\n“How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet\r\nof him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth\r\npeace”. (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 52:7)\r\nThe mention of feet alludes to the vocation for service. Let\r\nus celebrate these messengers of peace.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Andorra, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Western European and other States.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The Group of Western European and other States\r\nis gratified to be able to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nSince 1948, more than half a million individuals — nearly\r\n750,000 persons — have contributed to these operations,\r\nserving the ideals of peace and progress that men and\r\nwomen of goodwill bequeathed us in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, in the wake of the horrors of the Second\r\nWorld War.\r\nIt is fitting for us to pay tribute today to all of those\r\nguardians of peace, most of them anonymous. How many\r\nwars have been avoided thanks to their courage, how many\r\nlives saved by their sacrifices? It is to them that I speak, on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Western European and other States,\r\nto express our sincerest gratitude.\r\nAllow me also to recall here, in particular, the more\r\nthan 1,500 of our fellow human beings who gave their lives\r\nso that peace could prevail over war. These are human\r\nbeings who epitomize love and all the best that humanity\r\nhas to offer. Their ultimate sacrifice reminds us that human\r\nbeings are capable of great altruism in the face of suffering\r\nand of calm when faced with the destructive passion of\r\narmed conflict, even at the risk of their own lives. This is\r\na promising sign for the human race in the third\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe Medal in memory of Dag Hammarskjöld, who\r\nhimself perished in the service of the Organization, is a\r\ntribute established by the Security Council to the eternal\r\nmemory of those who, within the United Nations, are\r\nengaged in the maintenance of peace. The Group of\r\nWestern European and other States warmly congratulates\r\nthe families of Commandant René de Labarrière, Count\r\nFolke Bernadotte and Secretary-General Dag\r\nHammarskjöld on their well-deserved awarding of this\r\nmedal. May the light of their good works guide us down\r\nthe long road of peace!\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nDuring these 50 years of peacekeeping operations,\r\nthe member States of the Group of Western European and\r\nother States, along with many other Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations, have made available men and women, as\r\nwell as important resources, to serve these operations.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn a world that has to deal every day with the\r\nconflicts revived by the end of the cold war, it is\r\nimportant that these operations continue and progress. It\r\nis also essential that people who participate directly in\r\nthese operations be guaranteed their safety in the field.\r\nThe agents of peace who received the Nobel Prize in\r\n1988 must find respect everywhere, for without them, war\r\nand conflict become savagery.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to the representative of the United States,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the host country.\r\nMr. Burleigh (United States of America): Fifty\r\nyears ago, the United Nations committed a handful of\r\nmilitary observers to the cause of peace in what would\r\nbecome the first United Nations peacekeeping operation.\r\nIn the spring of 1948, after two world wars and centuries\r\nof conflict, the world saw soldiers used in the service of\r\npeace. Together with their civilian colleagues, these\r\nsoldiers opened a new chapter in international affairs. In\r\nthese 50 years, our peacekeepers have continued to\r\nprovide peace to the many people suffering the ravages of\r\nwar and violence.\r\nFor more than five decades, the United Nations has\r\ntaken on the difficult challenges to peace throughout the\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nworld. During this time, our peacekeepers have prevented\r\nwars, saved lives and inspired hope across the globe. It is\r\na noble record, unparalleled in history, and a tribute to\r\nthose who have so unselfishly served.\r\nIt is fitting, at this time, that we remember our\r\npeacekeepers — men and women, young and old, military\r\nand civilian — who have sacrificed their lives in the\r\nservice of peace. Dag Hammarskjöld wrote that one should\r\n“seek the road which makes death a fulfilment”. United\r\nNations peacekeepers have sought the right road, and their\r\nefforts and sacrifices have not been in vain, for they have\r\nfallen so that others may live in peace. The true memorial\r\nto their sacrifice is the peace they helped create, the lives\r\nthey helped preserve, and the promise they helped sustain\r\nin order to “save succeeding generations from the scourge\r\nof war”.\r\nAs we commemorate the achievements of 50 years of\r\npeacekeeping under the colours of the United Nations, let\r\nus not forget the continuing missions and daily sacrifices of\r\nour peacekeepers in the field today. May they prevail and\r\novercome the many obstacles they face. May their families,\r\ntheir nations, and the United Nations support them as they\r\nserve far from home and country. Daily they are quietly\r\npursuing peace, and for that we thank them.\r\nOur commemoration must not end today, for there is\r\nmuch unfinished work. Let us honour our fallen\r\npeacekeepers with deeds, not words. Let us continue, both\r\nhere and in the field, with our efforts to improve\r\npeacekeeping. We can do this, and must do this. Let us\r\nrecommit ourselves today, as our peacekeepers have, to the\r\nservice of peace.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the representative of South Africa, who will speak\r\non behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nMr. Vermeulen (South Africa): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement at this\r\ncommemorative meeting marking the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping. On this special occasion, the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement wishes to pay tribute to all the\r\nmen and women who have, over the past 50 years, served\r\nas peacekeepers around the world under the United Nations\r\nflag. We honour the memory of all those among them who\r\nhave sacrificed their lives in the pursuit of peace. We add\r\nour voice in welcoming the establishment of the Dag\r\nHammarskjöld Medal as a tribute to those who have made\r\nthe highest sacrifice while serving in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nWhile the Non-Aligned Movement fully recognizes\r\nthe importance of United Nations peacekeeping efforts,\r\nthere is a need for a comprehensive review of the whole\r\nquestion of peacekeeping. This matter received prominent\r\nattention at the Non-Aligned Movement summit meeting\r\nwhich took place in Durban, South Africa, only last\r\nmonth.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement affirms its commitment\r\nand willingness to provide full support to United Nations\r\npeacekeepers to ensure that they are able to fulfil the\r\ntasks entrusted to them. Yet when we look back at 50\r\nyears of United Nations peacekeeping, let us remind\r\nourselves that durable peace is ultimately dependent on\r\nthe elimination of all facets of the causes of conflict.\r\nPeacekeeping is a support tool in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, which is a responsibility\r\nthat must be shared by all of us. In this regard, the Non-\r\nAligned Movement would once more like to stress the\r\nneed for regular and institutionalized consultations\r\nbetween troop-contributing countries and the Security\r\nCouncil, because this is an important step in confidence-\r\nbuilding, transparency and partnership.\r\nContemporary peacekeeping is increasingly\r\nmultidimensional and requires a more effective approach\r\nto coordinating the core military tasks with humanitarian\r\nassistance. As the Non-Aligned Movement has stated in\r\nthe past, dealing with challenges posed by this\r\nmultidimensional nature of peacekeeping will still require\r\nof us the ability to differentiate between peacekeeping\r\noperations and humanitarian assistance.\r\nThis differentiation also needs to be extended to\r\ncover civilian policing, whose role is increasingly crucial.\r\nI would like to recall the decision of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement on this matter highlighting the urgency of\r\ndeveloping agreed guidelines on the principles governing\r\nthe role of civilian police personnel in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nSeveral Non-Aligned Movement member countries\r\nare among the largest and most consistent contributors of\r\ntroops to United Nations peacekeeping. On this occasion,\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement wishes to underscore the\r\nimportance of resolving the question of delays in the\r\nreimbursement of troop costs and contingent-owned\r\nequipment leases, which have caused hardship to all\r\ntroop-and equipment-contributing countries.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure the Assembly of\r\nthe non-aligned countries’ commitment to peacekeeping and\r\nto assure it that the Movement will continue playing a\r\nconstructive role to enhance United Nations peacekeeping\r\nthrough the United Nations Special Committee on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations, which is the competent forum\r\nwith the mandate to comprehensively review the whole\r\nquestion of peacekeeping in all its aspects.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to the representative of Nigeria, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Group of African States and as Chairman of\r\nthe Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations.\r\nMr. Gambari (Nigeria): It is a happy coincidence that\r\nthe General Assembly, at this fifty-third session, will mark\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights and that today it is commemorating 50 years\r\nof United Nations peacekeeping. There can be no peace\r\nwithout fundamental freedoms, and human rights cannot be\r\nexercised in an atmosphere of national chaos and conflict.\r\nPerhaps more than others, we Africans appreciate this\r\nlinkage, especially in view of our recent history of struggle\r\nagainst colonialism and apartheid and the unfortunate reality\r\nof persistent conflicts in our continent. For this reason, we\r\nin Africa, as part of the international community, are\r\nstrongly committed to both the promotion of human rights\r\nand the preservation of world peace and security.\r\nToday’s commemoration of 50 years of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations is an opportunity for both\r\ncelebration and reflection. As we assemble here, men and\r\nwomen in uniform, wearing the blue helmets of the United\r\nNations, are out in the field, putting themselves at risk in\r\nthe service of international peace and security. We salute\r\ntheir courage and their commitment. We also recognize that\r\nwhen States Member of the United Nations deploy their\r\npeacekeepers to conflict situations, this is a reaffirmation of\r\ntheir full commitment to the promotion of international\r\npeace and security. In ascribing the primary responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace to the Security\r\nCouncil, the Charter of the United Nations also demands\r\nthat its Members establish and maintain the very essence of\r\nthe very peace that Governments seek to establish: the\r\npromotion and protection of the political, economic, cultural\r\nand social rights of the individual, the community and\r\nsociety as a whole.\r\nAfrican States have been major beneficiaries of United\r\nNations peacekeeping, but it must also be remembered that\r\nAfrican States have made significant contributions to\r\ninternational peacekeeping efforts. We have sent troops,\r\nobservers and civilian police, some of whom have made\r\nthe ultimate sacrifice. We have also provided force\r\ncommanders for some of the United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations — some of whom are here with us today —\r\nand we have for the most part paid our assessed\r\ncontributions for peacekeeping.\r\nMoreover, since 1993, the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) has played an increasing role in the\r\nresolution of conflict in our continent. The OAU\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution is Africa’s response to the United Nations\r\nAgenda for Peace. It is a clear acceptance on the part of\r\nthe OAU member States of their responsibility to be\r\nproactive and supportive of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, especially in their\r\ncontinent.\r\nA few years ago, the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity agreed, within the context\r\nof their cooperative efforts, that there was an urgent need\r\nto enhance cooperation in the area of conflict prevention,\r\nconflict management and conflict resolution. They agreed,\r\ninter alia, that, first, the interrelationship between human\r\nrights, democracy, security, stability and development in\r\nAfrica necessitated effective cooperative action between\r\nthem. The United Nations Agenda for Peace has provided\r\nboth organizations with the opportunity to render even\r\ngreater service in a manner consistent with the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charters of both the United Nations\r\nand the OAU.\r\nSecondly, they agreed that the OAU could play a\r\nconstructive role in preventing, managing and resolving\r\nconflicts in Africa, but that the United Nations should\r\nassist the OAU to establish and strengthen those\r\nstructures and procedures which would enhance its\r\ncapabilities to settle disputes and prevent conflicts. This\r\nwas in fact endorsed by the Security Council when it\r\ndiscussed the situation in Africa last year, and again as\r\nrecently as last month.\r\nFinally, we believe that the cooperation in the area\r\nof international peacekeeping between the United Nations\r\nand the OAU should be further strengthened and\r\nenhanced for the benefit of both Africa and the world.\r\nWhile we insist — and we will continue to insist — on\r\nthe Charter provision that it is the Security Council which\r\nhas primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security everywhere, there are in\r\nfact instances when the OAU has a comparative\r\nadvantage in helping prevent, manage and resolve\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 29th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 6 October 1998\r\nconflicts in our continent. For instance, the OAU members\r\nare closer to conflict situations in the continent, possess\r\ngreater knowledge of the causes of those conflicts and often\r\ndemonstrate greater political will to solve their own\r\nproblems. In addition, OAU and subregional peacekeeping\r\nefforts are cheaper than those of the United Nations.\r\nMoreover, subregional organizations such as the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States and the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community have demonstrated the\r\nwill and the capacity to respond to the challenges of\r\npeacekeeping and peacemaking in our continent.\r\nNonetheless, regional and subregional organizations require\r\nlogistic and financial support from the international\r\ncommunity in order to be effective partners with the United\r\nNations so as to meet the complex and growing challenges\r\nof peacekeeping in the post-cold-war era.\r\nSpeaking now in my capacity as Chairman of the\r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, I have the\r\nhonour to introduce the draft resolution (A/53/L.5) that is\r\nbefore the General Assembly, the annex to which contains\r\nthe Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary\r\nof United Nations Peacekeeping.\r\nAt a time when peacekeeping faces great challenges\r\nand plays a crucial role in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the Special Committee on Peacekeeping\r\nOperations believes that it is most fitting that we should\r\nmark the fiftieth anniversary of peacekeeping through the\r\nadoption of a formal declaration.\r\nThrough the Declaration before the Assembly, which\r\nwas initiated by Ukraine but drafted and supported by the\r\nentire Special Committee, the General Assembly would\r\npay tribute to the hundreds of thousands of men and\r\nwomen who have, in the past 50 years, served under the\r\nUnited Nations flag in almost 50 operations around the\r\nworld.\r\nWe would also honour the memory of more than\r\n1,500 peacekeepers who have laid down their lives in the\r\ncause of peace, and in this regard, would welcome very\r\nwarmly the establishment by the Security Council of the\r\nDag Hammarskjöld Medal.\r\nAbove all, we would reaffirm our commitment to\r\nprovide full support to the peacekeepers of the United\r\nNations, to ensure that they can successfully fulfil the\r\ntasks entrusted to them by Members of our Organization.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nwill now proceed to a decision on draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.5, entitled “Fiftieth anniversary of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping”.\r\nBefore we do so, allow me to respectfully welcome\r\nSecretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, an eminent\r\nLatin American who served from 1982 to l991 as\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to\r\nadopt draft resolution A/53/L.5?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.5 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/2).\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): This\r\nconcludes the commemorative meeting marking the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.\r\n13\r\n"
