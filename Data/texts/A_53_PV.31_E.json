(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 99\r\nCommemorative meeting of the twentieth anniversary of\r\nthe adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for\r\nPromoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation\r\namong Developing Countries\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): This\r\ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly is being\r\nheld in accordance with the decision adopted at its 3rd\r\nplenary meeting on 15 September 1998 and pursuant to\r\nresolution 52/205 of 18 December 1997.\r\nI would request that during this meeting of the\r\nAssembly we strive to be as brief and concise in our\r\nstatements as possible, in view of the value that we attach\r\nto our time.\r\nWe are meeting here today to commemorate a key\r\nevent in the history of international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. The United Nations Conference on Technical\r\nCooperation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos\r\nAires from 30 August to 12 September 1978, was a\r\nmilestone in the United Nations system’s ongoing efforts to\r\npromote international cooperation for development, which,\r\nas we all know, is one of the primary objectives of the\r\nOrganization. The Conference adopted the Buenos Aires\r\nPlan of Action as a normative framework designed to\r\nimprove the structure of international relations by placing\r\ngreater emphasis on the use of the increasing technical and\r\nscientific capacities of developing countries in the\r\npromotion of socio-economic development in the South.\r\nAs the ultimate goal of technical cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries, the Plan establishes, on the one\r\nhand, the promotion of national and collective self-\r\nreliance among developing countries, and, on the other\r\nhand, the fostering of global partnership. Accordingly, for\r\nthe past 20 years the Buenos Aires Plan of Action has\r\nprovided a policy framework to enable developing\r\ncountries to enhance their self-reliance by harnessing and\r\nexploiting their own capacities.\r\nTo underscore the continued importance of\r\ninternational partnership, the Plan emphasizes that its new\r\nproposals are complementary to, not a substitute for,\r\ntraditional forms of North-South development cooperation.\r\nAlthough it assigns primary responsibility to developing\r\ncountries for organizing, managing and financing\r\ntechnical cooperation among themselves, the Plan also\r\ncalls upon the United Nations development system to play\r\na catalytic and promotional role in advancing this\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Plan sets forth a number of goals that require\r\ndeveloping countries to enhance their creative capacities;\r\nshare their human and technical resources; upgrade the\r\nquality and scope of international cooperation; and expand\r\nand refine communications among themselves on the\r\nnational, subregional, regional and interregional levels.\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nThe continuing validity of the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nconferences and governing bodies of many specialized\r\nagencies. In particular, General Assembly resolution 46/159\r\nindicates that technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries remains a key element in global economic\r\ncooperation. In resolution 48/172, the Assembly went\r\nfurther by urging Member States, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and other organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations development system to give high priority\r\nand full support to technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries.\r\nSince the 1970s, developing countries have\r\nincreasingly used the technical cooperation framework to\r\nstrengthen the bonds of cooperation among themselves in\r\nthe context of formal subregional and regional integration\r\narrangements and through more flexible cooperative\r\nexchanges. The developing countries have also sought to\r\npromote genuine partnership among themselves on the\r\nunderstanding that each country has resources and\r\ncapacities that it can share and offer, as well as needs that\r\nmay be satisfied by others. Many countries have taken the\r\ninitiative of establishing well-defined policies and\r\nappropriate institutional arrangements in order to ensure a\r\ncoordinated approach and to find common solutions to\r\ncommon problems within the framework of technical\r\ncooperation among developing countries. In the wake of\r\nrecent trends towards globalization, technical cooperation\r\namong developing countries is increasingly being\r\nrecognized as an important instrument for enabling\r\ncountries of the South to participate effectively in the\r\nemerging new world order. This is all the more true given\r\nthe well-known trend among the industrialized countries to\r\nreduce official development assistance, in particular as\r\nregards the allocation of funds to multilateral programmes\r\nand agencies.\r\nIn order that the full potential of technical cooperation\r\namong developing countries may be realized and to fulfil\r\nthe expectations raised 20 years ago by the Buenos Aires\r\nPlan of Action, all Member States, developed and\r\ndeveloping alike, must seize the current momentum and\r\nbuild upon the past achievements in technical cooperation\r\namong developing countries. This will require tireless\r\nefforts to make the potential of technical cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries widely understood, to strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of normative frameworks, procedures and\r\nfocal points for technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries on the national level, and to promote information-\r\nsharing among developing countries at the subregional,\r\nregional, interregional and global levels. It will also\r\nrequire the international community to be more\r\nforthcoming with financing for activities undertaken\r\nwithin the context of technical cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThus, this commemorative meeting is an opportune\r\nmoment for the international community to renew the\r\npolitical will necessary to overcome the factors hindering\r\nthe optimal utilization of the existing capacities and\r\nresources and to accelerate development throughout the\r\ndeveloping world. Given the prevailing mix of\r\nopportunities and challenges presented by globalization,\r\nthe potential of such exchanges needs to be fully\r\nexploited. The promising prospects of increased trade and\r\ninvestment opportunities in the South are discernible in\r\nthe current demographic projections, which indicate that,\r\nby the year 2025, nearly 7 billion of the projected world\r\npopulation of 8.5 billion people will live in the South —\r\n7 out of 8.5 billion. This suggests that there is tremendous\r\nscope for the South to capitalize on increased market and\r\ninvestment opportunities.\r\nIn conclusion, responding to the recommendations of\r\nthe Buenos Aires Plan of Action in the new context of\r\nglobalization — an issue to which this Assembly has been\r\npaying particular attention — requires developed and\r\ndeveloping countries to work cooperatively to devise new\r\nand improved approaches both for national institutions\r\nand on the global scale, so as to promote public and\r\nprivate enterprise, actions by economic players and by\r\nStates themselves, in order to achieve the lofty objective\r\nof technical cooperation among developing countries.\r\nI now give the floor to the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: We are gathered\r\nhere to mark the twentieth anniversary of the Buenos\r\nAires Plan of Action, in keeping with the General\r\nAssembly resolution adopted to that effect last year. Over\r\nthese two decades, the international community has taken\r\nseriously the recommendations contained in the Plan of\r\nAction. Against the background of growing disparities\r\nbetween rich and poor countries, the Plan was designed\r\nto provide a road map for narrowing that gap.\r\nThe Plan urged all partners involved in international\r\ndevelopment cooperation to bring South-South solutions\r\nto shared development challenges by increasing the use of\r\nthe human capacities and material resources that exist in\r\nthe South.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nSouth-South cooperation has enjoyed official\r\nrecognition in the United Nations since the Buenos Aires\r\nConference in 1978. It encompasses two types of\r\npartnership: technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries and economic cooperation among developing\r\ncountries. The two interrelated approaches are intended to\r\nenable the South to promote collective self-reliance and to\r\nparticipate effectively in the international economic system.\r\nSince the 1970s the benefits of South-South\r\ncooperation have been most manifest in the formation of\r\nregional groupings across the South. Through regional\r\nintegration, many countries have expanded their market\r\nsize, accelerated the pace of industrialization and laid the\r\nfoundation for a more systematic integration of production\r\nstructures across national boundaries. While some of these\r\nintegration schemes have stagnated, many have made steady\r\nprogress and gained vitality and momentum during the\r\n1980s and 1990s.\r\nThe profound changes that have occurred in the\r\ninternational system since the late 1980s have had an\r\nequally profound impact on multilateral development\r\ncooperation. They have established a new context and a\r\nnew rationale for promoting technical cooperation and\r\nSouth-South cooperation in general. These developments\r\nhave underscored the futility of unilateral action in an\r\ninterdependent world.\r\nSince the 1970s the United Nations has played an\r\nimportant role in promoting technical cooperation. It has\r\nprovided guidance on policies and procedures. It has\r\nsupported institutional capacity-building, networking and\r\ninformation systems. Many United Nations organizations\r\nand agencies, including regional commissions, have actively\r\npromoted policies that place great emphasis on South-South\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn the area of capacity-building, UNDP has provided\r\nsupport to the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) and the Central American Common\r\nMarket and commodity groups such as the Union of\r\nBanana-Exporting Countries in efforts to strengthen their\r\noverall capacity. The Food and Agriculture Organization of\r\nthe United Nations (FAO), the International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO), the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International\r\nTelecommunication Union (ITU) have provided similar\r\nassistance to various regional groupings in the development\r\nof national and regional institutions of developing\r\ncountries in keeping with their respective mandates and expertise.\r\nWith support from the United Nations organizations\r\nand agencies, improved networking and twinning\r\narrangements have become a significant feature of\r\ntechnical cooperation in recent years. UNESCO has\r\nsupported educational networks in the Caribbean and\r\nfostered exchanges among various scientific organizations\r\nworldwide. The ILO has facilitated exchanges among\r\nvarious centres of excellence in the field of labour\r\nadministration. Using networks to foster food security,\r\nFAO has been instrumental in the creation of the Biogas\r\nNetwork in Latin America and has supported the\r\nestablishment of food crops networks. The United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has\r\nsupported a trade information network linking a number\r\nof Asian countries in addition to sponsoring the Global\r\nTrade Point Network, which applies modern information\r\ntechnology to trade promotion.\r\nMany developed countries have been very supportive\r\nof technical cooperation activities initiated by groups of\r\ndeveloping countries. Japan, Ireland and South Korea\r\nhave contributed generously to the United Nations\r\nVoluntary Trust Fund for South-South Cooperation,\r\nestablished in 1995 by the Administrator of the United\r\nNations Development Programme. Brazil and Chile have\r\nset up special funds to assist other developing countries\r\nin Latin America within the framework of TCDC. In light\r\nof the declining trend in official development assistance,\r\nas well as in core resources available to UNDP and other\r\nUnited Nations agencies, increased contributions to the\r\nTrust Fund for South-South Cooperation are needed.\r\nThe unprecedented changes which have occurred in\r\nthe international economic system since the 1980s —\r\nprincipally the globalization of markets and production\r\nstructures — make South-South cooperation more valid\r\nand relevant than ever as an instrument for helping\r\ndeveloping countries to participate effectively in the\r\nemerging economic order.\r\nSeveral challenges lie ahead. First, despite the\r\naccelerated differentiation in socio-economic performance\r\namong developing countries, we must recognize that the\r\ncountries of the South still share a number of basic\r\ndevelopment needs. These include the need for external\r\ncapital and development assistance; for access to export\r\nmarkets and foreign exchange; for technologies; and for\r\nan external economic environment that is fair, predictable\r\nand stable.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nSecondly, these shared needs establish a new rationale\r\nfor South-South cooperation. It is one that requires\r\ndeveloping countries to pool their human and material\r\nresources and to work collectively for a more just, equitable\r\nand democratic world system. If the countries of the South\r\nare to be masters of their destiny, they need to have an\r\neffective voice in all international forums.\r\nThirdly, given the complex mix of opportunities and\r\nchallenges presented by globalization, the United Nations\r\nsystem and the international community as a whole must\r\nadjust to the demands of the new development context and\r\nredouble their efforts in support of technical and economic\r\ncooperation.\r\nFourthly, all organizations and agencies of the United\r\nNations system must implement Economic and Social\r\nCouncil resolution 1992/41. They must ensure that technical\r\nand economic cooperation are given first consideration in\r\nthe design, formulation, implementation and evaluation of\r\ntheir operational activities. The United Nations family\r\nshould also increase the allocation of resources for technical\r\nand economic cooperation from their regular programme\r\nbudgets. United Nations organizations and agencies should\r\nfind opportunities to promote joint cooperative\r\narrangements and bring their various sectoral competencies\r\nto bear on South-South cooperation activities. Regional\r\nCommissions should play an active role in promoting and\r\nsupporting intra- and interregional activities of strategic\r\nimportance to subregional and regional groupings.\r\nThis meeting, on the eve of the new millennium,\r\nprovides an opportune moment for the international\r\ncommunity to reflect upon the resources, strategies and\r\npartnerships that developing countries need to seize the\r\nopportunities our globalizing world presents.\r\nIn this era of dwindling resources for development, it\r\nis critically important to build new partnerships to draw on\r\nmutual knowledge and capacities. United Nations\r\norganizations and agencies should strengthen contacts with\r\norganizations in the developing world and help foster\r\neffective participation of the private sector in technical and\r\neconomic cooperation activities. And I urge all countries to\r\ncontribute to the Voluntary Trust Fund for South-South\r\nCooperation.\r\nRenewed efforts to advance the goals of South-South\r\ncooperation call for a coordinated approach among the\r\nentire United Nations family. This session of the General\r\nAssembly will be considering a revised version of the\r\nguidelines for the review of policies and procedures\r\nconcerning technical cooperation and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on strengthening the integration of\r\ntechnical and economic cooperation approaches to\r\ndevelopment.\r\nI encourage all members of the United Nations\r\nfamily to include a South-South dimension in their\r\noperational activities in keeping with the guidelines once\r\nthey are endorsed.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nremind representatives that this meeting is exclusively\r\ndevoted to the commemoration of an important\r\nanniversary of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. It is not\r\na regular working meeting to consider in depth the\r\nquestion of South-South technical cooperation. I therefore\r\nurge all speakers to manage their time in the most\r\ncooperative way possible.\r\nI call first on the representative of Nigeria, who will\r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nMr. Akunwafor (Nigeria): It is my honour and\r\nprivilege to make the following statement on behalf of the\r\nGroup of African States at the United Nations.\r\nPlease allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nrecent well-deserved election to the presidency of our\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. In Nigeria, my\r\ncountry, and Africa, my continent and region, we have no\r\ndoubt that the conduct of the Assembly’s affairs will\r\nbenefit a great deal from your experience and wisdom.\r\nGranted that all African States are members of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement and of the Group of 77, whose\r\noriginal idea it was to establish the mechanism for\r\npromoting technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries (TCDC), my brief remarks this morning would\r\nnot be properly rooted should we fail to recall that\r\nAfrica’s love for and faith in the necessity and potential\r\nof TCDC date back to 1977, one year ahead of the birth\r\nof the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. Meeting at its\r\ntwenty-ninth ordinary session in Libreville, Gabon, in July\r\n1977, the Council of Ministers of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) first recognized that\r\n“TCDC is a historical imperative brought about by\r\nthe need for a new international order” [and] “a\r\nconscious, systematic and politically motivated\r\nprocess developed to create a framework of multiple\r\nlinks between developing countries”.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nWithin the same July 1977, the Assembly of Heads of\r\nState and Government of the OAU endorsed the Ministers’\r\nrecommendations, which were again reaffirmed by the\r\nOAU Council of Ministers in July 1978 at their thirty-first\r\nordinary session, held in Khartoum, Sudan. Consequently,\r\nthe then nearly 50 OAU member delegations became part\r\nand parcel of the delegations from 138 States which, in\r\nBuenos Aires on 12 September 1978, adopted by consensus\r\na plan of action now known as the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction for Promoting and Implementing Technical\r\nCooperation among Developing Countries.\r\nWhat subsequently gladdened the hearts of all\r\nAfricans — and, I must add, the hearts of citizens of all\r\ndeveloping countries — was that singular display of\r\nwisdom and sensitivity on the part of this Assembly in\r\nDecember 1978, when it resolved to endorse the Buenos\r\nAires Plan of Action, as it concerns the development needs\r\nof more than two thirds of United Nations membership, and\r\nurged all Governments and elements of the United Nations\r\nsystem to implement its recommendations.\r\nToday, two decades later and on the threshold of a\r\nnew millennium, the twentieth anniversary of the blueprint\r\nBuenos Aires Plan of Action should afford us all not just\r\nan opportunity to roll out the drums and beat our chests in\r\ncelebration of the achievements we have made. Today, and\r\nequally importantly, we all should undergo a sober\r\nreflection, stocktaking and candid inward search that will\r\nshow us concretely how much we ought to have achieved\r\nand the problems or further challenges we need to\r\novercome.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIndeed, nothing implies the importance of the Buenos\r\nAires Plan of Action more than the words of our good\r\nfriend and the highly resourceful outgoing Administrator of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\r\nMr. James Gustav Speth, when he reminded us in May this\r\nyear that, for the developing countries, TCDC and South-\r\nSouth cooperation are no longer options, but imperatives in\r\nour age of globalization. As we celebrate, we are therefore\r\njustifiably joyful that UNDP has not abandoned the lot of\r\nthe developing countries. Particularly through its Special\r\nUnit for Technical Cooperation among Developing\r\nCountries and its prolific publicity literature, UNDP has\r\nhelped in no small measure to increase awareness of the\r\nimportance of TCDC and the development needs of the\r\ndeveloping countries. As a reliable catalyst and active\r\npartner of national Governments and organizations and\r\nagencies of the United Nations system, the Special Unit has\r\nbeen promoting and monitoring the global application of\r\nTCDC in a variety of ways, including sponsorship of\r\nTCDC activities-based studies and assessments,\r\nenhancement of national capacities for the management of\r\nTCDC, and matching capacities with needs.\r\nIt is out of such sensitization and enhancement\r\nefforts that a number of countries have come to allocate\r\nsignificant resources for TCDC activities from their\r\nnational budgets and/or UNDP country allocations. It is\r\nout of such efforts that research — for instance, into\r\nmedicinal plants in one of the South countries — has\r\nrecently yielded a welcome lead into the network research\r\nand management of the menace of the sickle-cell disease\r\nin some other developing countries, thus raising hope for\r\na definite cure some day. We are also happy that\r\ncomplementarities of natural endowments among the\r\ndeveloping countries and their varying stages of\r\ndevelopment, as highlighted in the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction, have deepened technical cooperation among some\r\ncountries in the South, thus providing them with vast\r\nopportunities for knowledge transfer or exchange with\r\nrelative ease and at less expense than if they had had to\r\nacquire similar knowledge from the developed countries.\r\nNeither must we fail to acknowledge at this\r\ngathering the supporting and positive role being similarly\r\nplayed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) for the promotion of South-\r\nSouth trade and finance, the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and the South Centre in support of the G-77\r\ninitiatives for cooperation.\r\nIn conclusion, let me return to a point made in our\r\nearlier outline. As we celebrate the twentieth anniversary\r\nof the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, we will be doing our\r\ncollective memory and posterity a great favour if we also\r\nspare a little time to highlight areas which our best of\r\nefforts might have neither reached nor yielded desired\r\nresults from.\r\nFirst, even a full-course intra-South technical\r\ncooperation programme, involving all developing\r\ncountries, would still need official development assistance\r\nto succeed in achieving its goal. The continuing decline\r\nof success in achieving the agreed target of 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross national product for official development\r\nassistance, which is a major external source for the\r\nfinancing of development, therefore needs to be reversed\r\nin order to enable TCDC to have the crucial input to\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\ninfrastructural and social sector development from the\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nSecondly, and made even worse by the recent adverse\r\nglobal financial crisis, all developing countries, especially\r\nthe 40 least developed among them, most of which are in\r\nAfrica, are being severely hindered in their cooperating\r\nefforts by excruciatingly heavy external debt burdens. This\r\nhandicap is especially bad for the heavily indebted poor\r\ncountries. One of the many measures to alleviate its\r\nnegative impact lies in the conversion of debt to promote\r\ndevelopment investments, in accordance with the needs of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThirdly, market access to exports from developing\r\ncountries is one crucial component that will enhance the\r\ncapacity of each developing country to cooperate more\r\ngainfully and meaningfully. The current international\r\ntrading system will assist developing countries, especially\r\nthose producing commodities, more gainfully if, and only\r\nif, the system is made multilaterally equitable, secure, non-\r\ndiscriminatory and predictable in its rules and thereby\r\ncapable of enhancing the economic capacity of the\r\ndeveloping countries concerned.\r\nThese are the barest minimum of core needs of the\r\ndeveloping countries. If they are properly addressed, and if\r\nthere is the required increase in core resources for United\r\nNations Development Programme funding, as we are about\r\nto enter the twenty-first year of the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction, a means will be generated to eradicate poverty and\r\nappropriately protect and empower the citizenry of\r\ndeveloping countries to access the benefits of globalization\r\nin an interdependent world.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI call next on the representative of Nepal, who will speak\r\non behalf of the Group of Asian States.\r\nMr. Shah (Nepal): I will heed the President’s repeated\r\nadvice and be as brief as possible.\r\nOn behalf of the member States of the Asian Group,\r\nI should like to pay our tribute to the spirit and efforts of\r\nthe 138 countries which adopted the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction for Promoting and Implementing Technical\r\nCooperation among Developing Countries 20 years ago in\r\nBuenos Aires, Argentina.\r\nToday is an occasion to renew our commitment and to\r\nreaffirm the continued relevance of South-South\r\ncooperation, with the ultimate objective of building a more\r\nequitable global partnership for development and peace.\r\nIt is also an occasion for all of us to review not only the\r\nachievements of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, but,\r\nmore important, the lessons learned from its\r\nimplementation.\r\nIn the 20 years since the adoption of the Buenos\r\nAires Plan of Action, profound and almost unrecognizable\r\nchanges have taken place in international relations.\r\nGreater interdependence in the world, brought about by\r\nglobalization and economic liberalization, is posing new\r\nchallenges and risks, but it also provides a new impetus\r\nand a new rationale for closer cooperation among nations.\r\nWe believe that further strengthening of South-South\r\ncooperation is an essential instrument for ensuring the\r\nequitable participation of developing countries in the\r\nemerging global economy.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI call on the representative of Poland, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. Wyzner (Poland): I am privileged to offer a\r\nfew observations today on behalf of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States.\r\nTwenty years ago the United Nations Conference on\r\nTechnical Cooperation among Developing Countries and\r\nthe adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for\r\nPromoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation\r\namong Developing Countries marked a new perception of\r\nthe environment needed for international dialogue on\r\ntechnical cooperation. For a long time this cooperation\r\nhad been concentrated almost exclusively along traditional\r\nlines of North-South partnership, while the growing\r\npotential of the developing countries themselves had not\r\nbeen fully taken into consideration. The Buenos Aires\r\nConference generated a new type of international\r\nrelations, based on closer regional exchange of\r\nexperiences between developing countries, with the use of\r\na special technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries (TCDC) modality anchored in the operational\r\nactivities of the United Nations system.\r\nIn the last two decades a number of developing\r\ncountries have emerged as areas of considerable economic\r\ndevelopment and as important sources of technological\r\ninnovation. We note with satisfaction the increasing\r\neconomic potential of the South, which is becoming an\r\nimportant player in the world economy. On the other\r\nhand, this fact reinforces both the opportunities and the\r\nfurther need of the developing countries to forge the links\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nof cooperation among themselves. To this end, TCDC\r\noffers effective tools for an exchange of experiences in\r\ntechnical cooperation and problem-solving between\r\ndeveloping countries in pursuit of their mutual interests\r\nwith the final goal of increasing the competitiveness of their\r\neconomies in the global markets. At the same time, regional\r\ncooperation serves well the purpose of winning the support\r\nof civil societies for national policies, as it is easier for\r\nthem to relate to regional problems before they look beyond\r\nthese to global ones.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the United Nations has\r\nplayed a crucial role in the process of implementing the\r\nTCDC modality in the operational activities of the system.\r\nSpecial credit should be given to the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for incorporating these\r\npractices in programmes realized with a wide variety of\r\npartners on local levels and for establishing a Trust Fund\r\nwhich serves to intensify South-South cooperation.\r\nBy endorsing the Buenos Aires Plan of Action in its\r\nresolution of 1978, the General Assembly gave tangible\r\nproof of the commitment of the international community to\r\nthe spirit and the ultimate objective of the Plan. On a later\r\noccasion the General Assembly endorsed new directions to\r\nstrengthen TCDC’s role in offering technical advice for\r\ndevelopmental activities. At the same time, the Economic\r\nand Social Council recommended that first consideration be\r\ngiven to TCDC for use in development efforts in the United\r\nNations system as well as with all other partners. As a\r\nresult, intensified actions by several entities of the United\r\nNations system, such as UNDP, the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO), the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and\r\nsome of the regional economic commissions were\r\nundertaken to include TCDC in the mainstream of their\r\nactivities. However, a lot of work has yet to be done in this\r\nfield, and it is our belief that strengthening of the TCDC\r\nhas to be encouraged as an inherent part of developing\r\neffective regional cooperation.\r\nTaking into account the views expressed in the\r\nAgenda for Development, as well as the position taken last\r\nyear by the General Assembly in its resolution on economic\r\nand technical cooperation among developing countries, we\r\nbelieve that the United Nations system should continue its\r\nefforts to strengthen South-South cooperation, which, to\r\nquote from that resolution, “constitutes an important\r\nelement of international cooperation for development and is\r\nan essential basis for national and collective self-reliance as\r\nwell as a means of ensuring the effective integration and\r\nparticipation of developing countries in the world\r\neconomy and ... is not a substitute for, but rather\r\ncomplementary to, North-South cooperation”. (resolution\r\n52/205, para. 2)\r\nIn the Group of Eastern European States we realize\r\nthat there is considerable unexplored potential for forming\r\nnew partnership ties among the countries of the South and\r\nthe countries of our Group. There is also a need to extend\r\nthese links beyond the old divisions of South and North\r\nor East and West. On this solemn occasion, we reaffirm\r\nour commitment to achieving that goal in the years to\r\ncome, in accordance with the theme of our meeting today,\r\n“Towards a global partnership for South-South\r\ncooperation” in the new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the representative of the Dominican\r\nRepublic, who will speak on behalf of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States.\r\nMrs. Aguiar (Dominican Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I am greatly honoured, as coordinator of\r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, to\r\nhail this auspicious anniversary of the Buenos Aires Plan\r\nof Action, which bears the name of a progressive and\r\nforward-looking city in our hemisphere.\r\nIn 1978 the Buenos Aires Plan of Action gave\r\nimpetus to new forms of South-South cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries. Its goals included promoting the\r\ncapacity of developing countries to harness their own\r\nmeans to find solutions to the problems of development\r\nin keeping with their own values, aspirations and specific\r\nneeds; promoting and reinforcing a collective capacity\r\namong developing countries by exchanging experiences,\r\nsharing technical resources and developing\r\ncomplementary capabilities; increasing the volume and\r\nenhancing the quality of international cooperation and\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the resources devoted to\r\ngeneral technical cooperation through the pooling of\r\nskills; and promoting the transfer of appropriate\r\ntechnology and expertise. Since those goals were set, new\r\napproaches to subregional, regional and interregional\r\neconomic cooperation have emerged, compelling our\r\ncountries to revitalize the channels of this cooperation.\r\nThe Plan was proposed at the historic moment of the\r\nmost recent wave of decolonization, particularly in Africa\r\nbut also in Asia and the Caribbean, which marked a\r\nmilestone in international cooperation. Acknowledged as\r\nan effective way of promoting development among\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\ndeveloping countries, the form, content and goals of South-\r\nSouth cooperation have brought about significant changes,\r\nwhich are now taking place, however, within a process of\r\nglobalization that affects vital organs of our national\r\neconomies and productive systems on the one hand, and, on\r\nthe other, the traditional mechanisms of social solidarity.\r\nThe Plan’s merits were immediately recognized by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which, in resolution 33/134, endorsed\r\nthe Buenos Aires Plan of Action, considering it to be “an\r\nimportant instrument of the international community to\r\nintensify and strengthen co-operation among developing\r\ncountries”. (resolution 33/134, para. 4)\r\nAs an essential complementary component, the\r\nGeneral Assembly established, by resolution 38/201, the\r\nPérez-Guerrero Trust Fund, designed to support technical\r\nand economic cooperation among developing countries of\r\nthe Group of 77, and to finance feasibility and pre-\r\ninvestment studies and assist the implementation of projects\r\nfor economic cooperation among developing countries.\r\nThe validity and force of the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction have been confirmed by the progress made towards\r\ngoals such as promoting the capacity of countries to harness\r\ntheir own means, the fostering of collective capacity and\r\nthe exchange of experiences with a view to developing\r\ncomplementary capacities. However, since the laws of the\r\nmarket often prevail, our countries are forced to cope with\r\nthis unprecedented challenge by modifying their analytical\r\napproaches and the strategies that should be implemented\r\nin the developing world.\r\nWe are now seeing the emergence of decisive factors\r\nthat are transforming the usual framework, including the\r\nend of the role of the State as manager and entrepreneur;\r\ntechnological advances; the tightness of domestic markets;\r\nand the globalization of decisions relating to direct foreign\r\ninvestment. Therefore, to sustain successful South-South\r\ncooperation, our countries must make use of competitive\r\nadvantages resulting from a better distribution of resources,\r\nmarket efficiency and economies of scale and\r\nspecialization.\r\nHowever, the principles of the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction remain as valid as they were in 1978: solidarity, or\r\nthe principle of brotherhood among nations, in which two\r\nor more join forces to achieve common goals; sovereignty,\r\nor the principle of self-determination of States and mutual\r\ncooperation within the framework of the integration of\r\ncountries and regions; dignity, or the principle that\r\nreaffirms the legitimacy and equality of rights and respect\r\nfor the diversity of countries without conditions or\r\ndependency among cooperating partners.\r\nWe must keep in mind, however, that the successes\r\nwe have achieved thanks to the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction should in no way be presented as a smokescreen\r\nto hide our priorities. We must work to pool our needs\r\nand capacities in order to achieve better solutions in key\r\nareas such as agricultural development, food production\r\nand processing technologies.\r\nA major obstacle to this is the shortage of resources\r\nfor development, which could be eliminated or alleviated\r\nby the fact that certain economies of the group of\r\ndeveloping countries are emerging as surplus economies,\r\nmeaning that they have the capacity to export capital. It\r\nwould be desirable to make greater use of such a\r\nresource. In this regard, there is a need for the political\r\nwill to create regional mechanisms to promote the flow of\r\ncapital investment within each of the developing regions.\r\nThe modalities of technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries, of reciprocity, exchange and cooperative\r\ncommon use and contribution, would thus reflect the\r\npreviously established principles of a balanced\r\ncooperation among equals.\r\nIt would be possible to make many other proposals\r\nfor analysis and discussion. And the very fact that today\r\nwe are discussing the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and\r\nsetting innovative tasks for ourselves speaks eloquently of\r\nthe achievements of the last 20 years in the area of\r\ncooperation among the peoples and countries of the\r\nSouth.\r\nHowever, we must appeal to those countries that\r\nhave been left behind by this new plan — landlocked\r\ncountries, small island States, and those subject to\r\ndesertification and climate change. There is a place for\r\nthem as well in this bold new movement.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the representative of Andorra, who will\r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of Western European and\r\nother States.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): The Group of Western European and other\r\nStates is pleased to be able to celebrate the twentieth\r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction for Promoting and Implementing Technical\r\nCooperation among Developing Countries. The past two\r\ndecades have shown us that the growth in horizontal\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nSouth-South exchanges is an essential element for\r\ndevelopment. In that way the developing countries can\r\ncontrol exchanges in a way that is absolutely fair with\r\npartners whose technical and economic goals are similar but\r\nwhose concrete experiences are complementary to theirs. In\r\na world that is increasingly globalized, particularly at the\r\neconomic level, it is therefore important that developing\r\neconomies maintain steady relations with each other so that\r\nthe flow of information and cooperation can bring together\r\nStates that formerly did not know each other well or that\r\nencountered each other only through their common partners\r\nin the North. It is necessary for such solidarity and South-\r\nSouth projects to come into being so that globalization, that\r\nlate twentieth century phenomenon, can be truly\r\nmultidimensional.\r\nDevelopment is a process from which all of\r\nhumankind benefits. The rich countries will, in fact, be\r\ntruly rich only when the living conditions of the majority of\r\nhumankind rise to the same level as those of the most\r\nfortunate among us. Furthermore, because of globalization,\r\nrecent crises in emerging economies risk spreading to the\r\nindustrialized States, which again demonstrates the\r\ninterrelationship that exists between the rich and the poor\r\ncountries. Development concerns all of us, as the Group of\r\nWestern European and other States is fully aware.\r\nThe States members of the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States support all forms of development\r\nefforts and take a very positive view of the proliferation of\r\nSouth-South cooperation that followed the Buenos Aires\r\nPlan of Action. The Bandung Framework for Asia-Africa\r\nCooperation, the varied cooperation activities that have\r\nrecently taken place between Latin America and Eastern\r\nEurope and the implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States show the extent to which South-South\r\ninitiatives can and must spread. However, it is important to\r\nnote that technical and economic cooperation between\r\ncountries is complementary to North-South relations, not a\r\nsubstitute for them. Effective coordination between those\r\ntwo types of cooperation will be increasingly required.\r\nIt is the duty of the Members of the United Nations to\r\ndevise in the months to come the best formulas so that\r\nSouth-South and North-South cooperation can work\r\ntogether and have a synergistic effect. We must define a\r\nnew partnership between developed countries and\r\ndeveloping countries in which we all take upon ourselves\r\nour own responsibilities while leaving behind the errors of\r\nthe past. The new model for development will certainly\r\ninvolve a combination of solidarity and responsibility in\r\nwhich North-South action will be integrated with South-\r\nSouth cooperation. Numerous small, but independent and\r\nsuccessful, South-South projects can create conditions for\r\nsetting up other targeted and effective development\r\nassistance projects.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nProgress in communications and information\r\ntechnology has made globalization irreversible in all its\r\naspects. The developing countries are discovering\r\npossibilities for cooperation and mutual enrichment, which\r\nwe must encourage. In this, the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States congratulates the United\r\nNations bodies that are acting to promote such exchanges,\r\nsuch as the United Nations Development Programme and\r\nthe Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among\r\nDeveloping Countries. Here in the United Nations we are\r\nstarting a new debate on development that will not leave\r\nout South-South cooperation. The Assembly can rest\r\nassured that the States members of the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States will make their contribution.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the representative of the United States of\r\nAmerica, the host country.\r\nMr. Squadron (United States of America): I am\r\ndelighted, on behalf of the United States, the host country,\r\nto join in this discussion of technical cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries (TCDC). It provides us all with the\r\nopportunity to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of\r\nthe Buenos Aires Plan of Action of 1978, which was\r\nintended to encourage self-reliance and mutual support\r\namong developing countries through the exchange of\r\ntechnical information. Those goals are as valid today as\r\nwhen the Buenos Aires Plan of Action was first adopted.\r\nThe United States supports economic cooperation\r\namong developing countries (ECDC). We agree\r\nwholeheartedly with the view of the Secretary-General,\r\nwho said in May last year that South-South cooperation\r\nmust be more than a slogan. At the same time, we agree\r\nwith the 1997 statement of the tenth session of the High-\r\nlevel Committee on the Review of Technical Cooperation\r\namong Developing Countries, which noted that South-\r\nSouth cooperation should be viewed not as a substitute\r\nfor, but rather as a complement to, North-South\r\ncooperation. We have incorporated the principles of\r\nTCDC into many of our bilateral development assistance\r\nprogrammes.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) Development Assistance Committee\r\nalso supports both TCDC and ECDC. The United States\r\napplauds the current role of the United Nations in\r\nencouraging TCDC, in particular the efforts of the Special\r\nUnit housed within the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme. We believe that TCDC fits very well within\r\nbroader efforts to promote coordination, cooperation and\r\nreform among all the nations of the world.\r\nThe United States believes that we should increase the\r\neffectiveness of existing TCDC resources. Specifically, we\r\nbelieve that it is critically important to continue developing\r\nprogramme effectiveness indicators for those programmes.\r\nDeveloping good feedback mechanisms that measure the\r\neffectiveness of programmes benefits not only those who\r\nfund the programmes but the beneficiaries as well. As\r\nbeneficiary countries contribute to and receive reports on\r\nwhich programmes work best, they will be in a better\r\nposition to disseminate best-practice information to other\r\npotential beneficiaries. That is the essence of TCDC:\r\ndeveloping countries helping each other.\r\nGood feedback reporting on programme benefits by\r\nbeneficiary countries will benefit everybody in another way:\r\nprogramme analysis enhances the credibility of those\r\nprogrammes and makes it easier to justify funding\r\ndecisions. Insightful analysis advances the goal of\r\ntransparency, which benefits both those who provide funds\r\nand the beneficiaries.\r\nIn conclusion, the United States is extremely pleased\r\nto host this discussion. We thank representatives for their\r\nattendance and participation. We look forward to a fruitful\r\nexchange of views with the other nations of the world on\r\nthis subject.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now call on the representative of Indonesia, who will\r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): On behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China, I would like to congratulate the President\r\nand the General Assembly on having organized this\r\nimportant commemorative meeting. We are very grateful to\r\nall the Members that last year supported the initiative of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China that led to the adoption of the\r\nresolution by the General Assembly to convene this\r\ncommemorative meeting.\r\nSince its inception, the Group of 77 has always\r\nattached fundamental importance to promoting economic\r\nand technical cooperation among developing countries.\r\nSuch cooperation is necessary to reduce the vulnerability\r\nof the developing countries to external factors and to\r\nmaximize complementarities for accelerating the\r\ndevelopment of their economies. The historic Buenos\r\nAires Plan of Action, adopted 20 years ago, in September\r\n1978, and subsequently endorsed by the General\r\nAssembly, was an expression of the aspirations of\r\ndeveloping countries and a reflection of their desire to\r\npromote economic cooperation among themselves as a\r\ncomplement to North-South cooperation and as an integral\r\npart of the collective action of the Group aimed at the\r\npromotion of international cooperation for development.\r\nIt marked the beginning of a new phase of such\r\ncooperation, providing a blueprint with a well-defined\r\nmechanism for implementation and follow-up. The major\r\nthrust of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action remains of vital\r\nimportance, and it is even more relevant today as a result\r\nof globalization and liberalization. The Group of 77 and\r\nChina renews its commitment to intensify cooperation\r\namong developing countries for the attainment of\r\ncollective self-reliance, as is evidenced in the recently\r\nadopted Declaration of the summit of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and the Declaration of Foreign Ministers of\r\nthe Group of 77 adopted last month.\r\nIn recent years, the forces of globalization and\r\nliberalization have brought dramatic changes on the global\r\neconomic scene. For developing countries, various\r\nconstraints beyond their control prevent them from fully\r\nparticipating in this process. The majority of developing\r\ncountries and, in particular, the least developed and the\r\nlandlocked countries, with their meagre resources and\r\nunfavourable external supportive environment, are faced\r\nwith the seemingly insurmountable challenge of global\r\ncompetition, which has tended to marginalize them. In\r\nthis context, if South-South cooperation were more\r\nvigorously pursued, the developing countries would have\r\ngreater leverage on their external environment and on the\r\nNorth-South cooperation dialogue. At the same time, it\r\nwould contribute to solving many problems of\r\ndevelopment in the developing countries and thus enable\r\nthem to face the challenge of integrating with the global\r\neconomy more successfully on equitable and symmetric\r\nterms.\r\nThe developing countries have always been\r\nconscious of their own responsibility for promoting their\r\neconomic development and implementing economic and\r\ntechnical cooperation among themselves. The potential of\r\neconomic cooperation among developing countries\r\n(ECDC) and technical cooperation among developing\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\ncountries (TCDC) for trade and development is particularly\r\ngreat at this juncture in view of the increased liberalization\r\nand openness of developing countries and the substantial\r\nefforts to reform their trade policies. In this context, it is\r\nimperative that the Global System of Trade Preferences\r\namong developing countries (GSTP), whose origin is in the\r\nBuenos Aires Plan of Action, be further strengthened. There\r\nis a need to consider giving new impetus to GSTP\r\nnegotiations by adjusting past GSTP concessions to the\r\ncurrently applied tariff and import measures resulting from\r\nnational tariff and trade reforms, as well as from the\r\nUruguay Round agreements. It is also important to\r\nstrengthen regional and interregional trade by enlarging\r\nparticipation, expanding product coverage and deepening\r\nmutual concessions. The potential effectiveness of the\r\nGSTP has been substantially increased with the re-\r\nevaluation of the tariff instruments in developing countries’\r\nregimes following large-scale liberalization of non-tariff\r\nmeasures by many developing countries.\r\nFor instance, the GSTP Agreement provides that the\r\nspecial needs of the least developed countries, including\r\nlandlocked countries should clearly be recognized, and that\r\nconcrete preferential measures in favour of these countries\r\nshould be agreed upon. The least developed countries and\r\nmany landlocked countries will not be required to make\r\nconcessions on a reciprocal basis. These measures in the\r\nGSTP Agreement are aimed at boosting the exports of the\r\nleast developed countries, thereby enhancing their living\r\nstandards.\r\nThe Pérez-Guerrero Trust Fund and the trust fund for\r\nSouth-South Cooperation, established with a view to\r\nsupporting activities on economic and technical cooperation\r\namong developing countries, were of critical importance to\r\nthe Group of 77 and China in order to achieve national\r\ncollective self-reliance. It is essential today to increase the\r\nresources of both Funds in order to support South-South\r\ncooperation. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal\r\nto all countries, particularly to donor countries, to contribute\r\ngenerously to both Funds with a view to enabling the\r\nGroup of 77 and China to continue supporting South-South\r\ncooperative projects.\r\nThe United Nations system is uniquely placed to assist\r\ndeveloping countries in making the transition to a new\r\neconomic era. The ability of its institutions to objectively\r\nanalyse economic trends and to indicate policy options that\r\ngive primacy to developmental considerations is the\r\nbackbone of economic cooperation among developing\r\ncountries. The Group of 77 and China draws heavily on the\r\nsupport provided to it by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations\r\nIndustrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the\r\nUnited Nations system as a whole for the implementation\r\nof objectives set out in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action\r\nfor TCDC. In this context, and with a view to marking\r\nboth this anniversary and the ongoing efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations system in supporting South-South\r\ncooperation, I would like to propose that the General\r\nAssembly should declare a United Nations day on South-\r\nSouth cooperation. We also recognize the work\r\nundertaken by many institutions of the South aimed at\r\nproviding a valuable contribution to increasing the\r\nawareness of the international community, particularly in\r\nterms of the need for international cooperation\r\nrequirements in support of ECDC and TCDC. In this\r\nregard, the ongoing activities of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement’s centre for South-South technical cooperation\r\nin Jakarta deserve our support.\r\nDue to the present world economic situation, the\r\nquestion of intensifying South-South cooperation needs to\r\nbe accorded top priority by the United Nations system\r\nand the international community. The Group of 77 and\r\nChina thoroughly deliberated this question at the recently\r\nheld ministerial meeting in New York. The core of the\r\ndiscussions was on the indispensability of collective self-\r\nreliance not only as a vital instrument for accelerating\r\ndevelopment and eradicating poverty, but also as crucial\r\nfor engaging the North in meaningful dialogue with the\r\nSouth.\r\nThe main focus for intensifying South-South\r\ncooperation centres on the Caracas Programme of Action\r\nand the Buenos Aires Plan of Action on TCDC. While\r\nthe implementation of these two programmes has yielded\r\nsome results, much more needs to be done. In this regard,\r\nthe question of harmonizing both programmes was\r\nsquarely faced at the recently held South-South\r\nConference in San José. The Conference rightly\r\nrecommended to the Group of 77 and China to\r\nconsolidate and coordinate its activities on various issues\r\nand in various forums, in order to harmonize South-South\r\ninitiatives.\r\nWith increasing obstacles to our economic\r\ndevelopment, with the North-South dialogue yet to get\r\nunder way, and with emerging complementarities among\r\ndeveloping countries, it is even more urgent today than it\r\nwas 20 years ago when the Buenos Aires Plan of Action\r\nwas adopted to broaden the scope of our own technical\r\nand economic cooperation.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nWhile it is true that we must provide greater\r\nmomentum to ECDC and TCDC activities, we should guard\r\nagainst undertaking projects without fully assessing their\r\npotential. Indeed, this can greatly harm the very cause that\r\nwe seek to promote. We must at all times remember that\r\nECDC and TCDC projects must provide mutual benefits to\r\ndeveloping countries and should be economically viable. In\r\nthis context, I am pleased to announce that the office of the\r\nChairman of the Group of 77 will set up shortly a research\r\nprogramme on South-South cooperation in close\r\ncollaboration with the Group of 77 chapters and with the\r\nsupport of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO) and other relevant\r\nUnited Nations institutions, with a view to promoting\r\nresearch studies in the field of South-South cooperation.\r\nAs the Group of 77 and China have pointed out on\r\nmany occasions, the Caracas Programme of Action and the\r\nBuenos Aires Plan of Action are unusual in concept. They\r\nprovide a plan of action with clearly laid down mechanisms\r\nfor support, follow-up and review with diverse components\r\nwoven together into a precise timetable for implementation.\r\nThey should have provided ECDC and TCDC with the\r\ndynamism that was earlier lacking. The experience of the\r\npast two decades has raised several questions, relating in\r\nparticular to such matters as the financing of South-South\r\ncooperation. Today there is a need to find appropriate\r\norganizational modalities effectively to tap resources from\r\nvarious international organizations and financial institutions\r\nthat could be directed towards supporting South-South\r\ncooperation activities and programmes and to outline a\r\ncommon strategy to foster international support for the\r\nregional and subregional economic groupings of developing\r\ncountries and encourage mutual links and cooperation\r\namong them. In this context, let me take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our deep appreciation to countries that continue to\r\nsupport South-South cooperation, particularly the\r\nGovernment of Japan, which is generously supporting the\r\nforthcoming conference on subregional and regional\r\neconomic integration, to be held from 1 to 4 December\r\n1998 in Bali.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to reiterate, on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China, our strong support for the\r\nactivities being undertaken by the UNDP and its Special\r\nUnit for TCDC with a view to supporting South-South\r\ncooperation. In their final declaration, the Ministers for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Group of 77 who met last month in\r\nNew York expressed their appreciation for the support\r\nprovided by the UNDP and its Special Unit for TCDC in\r\nsupport of South-South cooperation, and encouraged the\r\nUNDP to continue to expand this cooperation with the\r\nGroup of 77 for the benefit of all developing countries.\r\nFinally, let me state that the United Nations system\r\nshould articulate a global strategy that could enable all\r\neconomic groupings of the South to respond adequately\r\nto the challenges of globalization and liberalization. This\r\nis an issue which should be discussed in depth by the\r\nhigh-level conference on subregional and regional\r\neconomic integration to be held from 1 to 4 December\r\n1998 in Bali, Indonesia.\r\nI am confident that the forthcoming Bali conference\r\nand the South Summit will set the stage for developing\r\ncountries to project their collective vision of international\r\ncooperation for development and of the strengthening of\r\nSouth-South cooperation for the next millennium.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI call next on the Permanent Representative of Austria,\r\nwho will speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union at this commemorative\r\nmeeting of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of\r\nthe Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and\r\nImplementing Technical Cooperation among Developing\r\nCountries. The Central and Eastern European countries\r\nassociated with the European Union — Bulgaria, the\r\nCzech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,\r\nPoland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the\r\nassociated country Cyprus, as well as the European Free\r\nTrade Association countries members of the European\r\nEconomic Area, Iceland and Norway, align themselves\r\nwith this statement.\r\nToday the General Assembly celebrates the twentieth\r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of\r\nAction. We want to make use of this opportunity to\r\nreflect on the lessons and accomplishments in promoting\r\ntechnical cooperation among developing countries\r\n(TCDC) over the last two decades, and to recognize the\r\nchanging environment for global partnerships in the era of\r\nglobalization.\r\nTwenty years ago, the General Assembly endorsed\r\nthe Buenos Aires Plan of Action as an important\r\ninstrument of the international community to intensify and\r\nstrengthen cooperation among developing countries, and\r\nit requested Governments, international organizations and\r\nthe United Nations development system to promote and\r\nimplement the objectives of the Plan.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nSouth-South cooperation, through TCDC and\r\neconomic cooperation among developing countries (ECDC)\r\nis a principal strategy in support of national and\r\ninternational development efforts. It is an indispensable\r\nmechanism to ensure participation in the global economy.\r\nTechnical cooperation characterized by North-South\r\nrelations remains an important factor in promoting\r\nsustainable human development. Since the adoption of the\r\nBuenos Aires Plan of Action, profound changes have taken\r\nplace in international relations. The deepening of\r\ninterdependence among nations, a phenomenon we call\r\nglobalization, provides new impetus, new opportunities and\r\na new rationale for closer cooperation, as well as new\r\nchallenges for States. We welcome the initiatives at\r\nregional and subregional levels to strengthen cooperation\r\nand integration among local economies.\r\nWe realize that we live in a rapidly changing world,\r\nand we have gathered here today to look to the future. The\r\ntheme of our commemoration is “Towards a global\r\npartnership for South-South cooperation in the new\r\nmillennium”, and at the panel meeting this afternoon we\r\nshould explore the role and relevance of technical and\r\neconomic cooperation among developing countries in an\r\nincreasingly interdependent world.\r\nThe European Union attaches great importance to\r\ntechnical cooperation among developing countries. The\r\nUnion reaffirms its commitment to supporting South-South\r\ncooperation and technical and economic cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries. In promoting TCDC, developing\r\ncountries harness and utilize the capacities that exist in their\r\nown countries. TCDC is a useful tool for and among\r\ndeveloping countries, but donor countries must play an\r\nactive and supportive role, fostering an increased use of the\r\nTCDC modality in development cooperation. The United\r\nNations system has a key responsibility as promoter and\r\ncatalyst for South-South cooperation. In this context, the\r\nEuropean Union would like to reiterate that TCDC should\r\nnot be treated as a special programme, but should be\r\nintegrated in the overall work of the operational activities\r\nof the United Nations system.\r\nThe potential development impact of TCDC on\r\ndeveloping countries is increasingly recognized, and the\r\nEuropean Union notes with satisfaction the expansion of the\r\nuse of TCDC over the years. In this context, the European\r\nUnion would like to mention as an example the Partners in\r\nPopulation and Development initiative supported by the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund. The enhanced\r\ndecentralization within the United Nations development\r\nsystem will further TCDC as a tool for development\r\nprogramming and as a logical option for development\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn this regard, the European Union commends the\r\nwork of the TCDC Special Unit within the United\r\nNations Development Programme and the ongoing\r\nsupport of the United Nations Development Programme\r\nfor the TCDC modality, which is being given first\r\nconsideration in programming as a corporate policy by the\r\nUNDP Administrator. This support is to be followed up\r\nby other organizations and bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nThe European Union believes that the revised\r\nguidelines for the review of policies and procedures\r\nconcerning TCDC have accentuated the continued validity\r\nand relevance of TCDC as an instrument for assisting\r\ndeveloping countries to participate effectively in the\r\nemerging global environment. With these tools in place,\r\nwe hope South-South cooperation can prosper in the next\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of South Africa,\r\nwho will speak on behalf of the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries.\r\nMr. Jele (South Africa): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement at this meeting\r\ncommemorating the twentieth anniversary of the adoption\r\nof the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and\r\nImplementing Technical Cooperation among Developing\r\nCountries.\r\nComing so soon after our summit in Durban, this\r\nmeeting could not be more timely. The issues and\r\nconcerns of developing countries at the Buenos Aires\r\nmeeting continue to challenge our commitment to South-\r\nSouth cooperation. For this reason, South-South\r\ncooperation continues to be one of the sound bases on\r\nwhich the developing countries can extricate themselves\r\nthrough their own efforts from the mire of\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nThe theme for this commemorative meeting is fitting\r\nand captures the interdependence of our global efforts for\r\nthe full realization of our objective. Like the Buenos\r\nAires Plan of Action, the advances made so far in South-\r\nSouth cooperation help facilitate the construction of a\r\nbridge across our experiences and efforts. It unites and\r\nconsolidates national, regional, subregional and\r\ninterregional efforts through various bodies and delivery\r\nsystems. Through technical cooperation among developing\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\ncountries (TCDC) developing countries will be able to\r\nrespond effectively and positively to the challenges of\r\nglobalization and liberalization, thus moving away from the\r\nrisk of marginalization. These efforts are indispensable for\r\nensuring an equitable mode of participation for developing\r\ncountries in the global economy.\r\nSuch efforts would also be underpinned by North-\r\nSouth cooperation and be directed at strengthening and\r\naccelerating technology transfers, skills, knowledge and\r\ninformation dissemination in the framework of South-South\r\ncooperation. To this end, we recall General Assembly\r\nresolution 3251 (XXIX) of 4 December 1974, which\r\nmandated the establishment of the Special Unit for\r\nTechnical Cooperation among Developing Countries to\r\npromote TCDC on a system-wide basis. Indeed, that\r\ndecision could not have been more timely and visionary,\r\ngiven the significant distance we have travelled to fully\r\nrealize the aim, among others, of making TCDC a key\r\ncomponent of the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) poverty eradication strategy.\r\nIn underscoring the need for South-South cooperation,\r\nwe note with appreciation the marking of this\r\ncommemoration at various levels — the high-level plenary\r\nsession, the substantive panel discussion and the exhibit on\r\nSouth-South cooperation. It is through similar efforts that\r\nawareness-building and the need for the mobilization of\r\nefforts to attain South-South cooperation may become a\r\nreality.\r\nWe commend the Special Unit for continuing to\r\nformulate its distinct programme to strengthen the capacity\r\nof developing countries and to mutually reinforce\r\ncooperation in key areas for development. Resource\r\nprovision for capacity-building is crucial and needs to be\r\nprovided on a continuous, secure and incremental basis. To\r\nthis end, we continue to make a case for an increase in the\r\ncore resources of UNDP in order to consolidate the\r\nprogress made thus far, as well as to cover the needs of\r\nother developing countries.\r\nWe call on the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development (UNCTAD), the Special Unit for\r\nTechnical Cooperation among Developing countries and\r\nUNDP, as well as other organizations, to jointly formulate\r\nconcrete recommendations on the follow-up and\r\nimplementation of the San José Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction, as adopted by the South-South Conference on\r\nFinance, Trade and Investment. We believe that this would\r\nhave added value for all our efforts to enhance the\r\nresurgence of interest in South-South cooperation to support\r\nthe efforts of developing countries to participate equitably\r\nin the global economy.\r\nIt is our belief that, taken as a whole, such efforts\r\nwould go a long way towards intensifying current\r\nprocesses to strengthen various interregional dialogues,\r\ncooperation and the exchange of experiences among\r\nvarious regional economic groupings for South-South\r\ncooperation. We hope that the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (TCDC/10/2) on the review of the progress made\r\nin implementing the Buenos Aires Plan of Action; the\r\ndecisions of the High-level Committee; the\r\nrecommendations of the South Commission; and its\r\nanalytical summary of information received from\r\nGovernments, other organizations in the United Nations\r\nsystem and non-governmental organizations on the\r\npolicies and activities undertaken to promote TCDC will,\r\ndespite other constraints, prove that TCDC continues to\r\nbe a widely used mechanism between countries,\r\nunderpinning many other local arrangements. This also\r\ngoes with the necessary awareness to adopt more effective\r\nmethods of delivery and policies.\r\nThe importance of these initiatives lies in the\r\nobservation that most developing countries now allocate\r\nsignificant resources from their national budgets for\r\nTCDC ventures to complement an array of other efforts\r\nwhich are also mirrored through regional institutions and\r\nother actors, such as the South Centre and UNDP through\r\nregional bureaus and country offices.\r\nWe hope that the Special Unit, by supporting\r\nnational and regional development initiatives, can\r\ncontinue to be a catalyst and an active partner in\r\npromoting and monitoring the global trends in TCDC and\r\nits application. The same applies to other United Nations\r\nagencies which have continued in similar fashion in areas\r\nof their own competence.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the new-directions strategy for\r\ntechnical cooperation among developing countries.\r\nFinally, we underscore the need for developing\r\ncountries and the United Nations system to increase\r\nsupport for TCDC and to strengthen the commitment to\r\npromote it as a useful tool for development. The Special\r\nUnit also needs to keep its separate identity within UNDP\r\nin order to continue being effective in its work, while at\r\nthe same time being complemented by other\r\ndevelopmental agencies and actors.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 31st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I give the floor to the representative of Japan.\r\nMr. Konishi (Japan): The concept of South-South\r\ncooperation emerged in the 1970s as a means of\r\nstrengthening the solidarity of the South in its struggle\r\nagainst the North and to promote among the developing\r\ncountries a collective self-reliance that would enable them\r\nto participate in the international economic system.\r\nWhen the cold war came to an end, this concept of\r\nSouth-South cooperation changed. Today, South-South\r\ncooperation has been widely accepted as an effective\r\nmodality of development cooperation in the spirit of\r\n“sharing the experiences”. Moreover, a new modality of\r\ntriangular cooperation involving the new dimension of\r\ncooperation between the North and the South has emerged.\r\nJapan has actively supported South-South cooperation\r\nbecause it provides useful assistance tailored to the specific\r\nneeds and conditions of individual developing countries and\r\nbecause it contributes to broadening the spectrum of actors\r\ninvolved in development cooperation. Japan hosted the\r\nTokyo International Conference on African Development in\r\n1993 and the Asia-Africa Forums of 1994 and 1997. It also\r\nconvened the Conference on Promoting South-South\r\nCooperation in May this year. It has implemented various\r\ntriangular cooperation projects, cooperated in institution-\r\nbuilding of the organizations responsible for South-South\r\ncooperation in developing countries, and provided financial\r\nassistance for such cooperation through the Japan-United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) Human\r\nResources Development Fund: $2 million in 1996 and\r\n1997, and $4 million in 1998.\r\nJapan commits itself to continuing to play this role in\r\nthe future. The second Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development, which will be convened from 19 to\r\n21 October 1998 with the participation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and the heads of State of a\r\nnumber of African countries, will emphasize the importance\r\nof South-South cooperation, and in particular Asia-Africa\r\ncooperation, including private sector development.\r\nIn further broadening the scope of South-South\r\ncooperation on the basis of the concept of “sharing the\r\nexperiences”, ownership by developing countries is of great\r\nimportance. It is critical that developing countries\r\nthemselves fully accept that South-South cooperation is an\r\neffective modality of development cooperation that goes\r\nbeyond enhancing their solidarity. While South-South\r\ncooperation is not a substitute for but a complement to\r\nNorth-South cooperation, it embodies various comparative\r\nadvantages to North-South cooperation, such as the\r\nexchange of technologies and know-how more appropriate\r\nto the actual conditions in developing countries.\r\nIn order to further strengthen South-South\r\ncooperation, developing countries should make the most\r\nof such comparative advantages, understanding that both\r\nSouth-South cooperation and North-South cooperation are\r\nkey elements in the realization of their national\r\ndevelopment programmes. And it is essential to develop\r\nand strengthen the human resources who will be\r\nresponsible for the implementation of South-South\r\ncooperation.\r\nDeveloped countries, in their turn, should support the\r\nefforts of developing countries through triangular\r\ncooperation involving the private sector and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. Furthermore, they should\r\nconvey to the developing countries the know-how and\r\nexpertise they have derived from their own experience in\r\ndevelopment cooperation.\r\nFinally, to promote South-South cooperation, it is\r\nnecessary to create an environment that permits easy\r\naccess to information on successful examples of such\r\nefforts. It would be of great value to all if a system could\r\nbe established to collect those successful examples from\r\ndifferent countries and organizations and to make them\r\navailable to developing countries.\r\nIn conclusion, South-South cooperation has\r\nenormous potential as an effective modality of\r\ndevelopment cooperation in the twenty-first century. It is\r\nup to developing countries to take the initiative for South-\r\nSouth cooperation, and developed countries should\r\ncontinue to actively support such cooperation.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe commemorative meeting to mark the occasion of the\r\ntwentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Buenos Aires\r\nPlan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical\r\nCooperation among Developing Countries is now\r\nconcluded.\r\nThe meeting rose at noon.\r\n15\r\n"
