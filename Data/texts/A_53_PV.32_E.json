I\r\nshould also like to associate myself with the statement\r\nmade yesterday by the Permanent Representative of\r\nIndonesia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe Declaration on Social Development and\r\nProgramme of Action adopted by the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development at Copenhagen in March 1995 marked\r\nthe renewed commitment of the international community\r\nto treating social development as the highest priority in\r\nthe agenda of nations and of the world.\r\nWe are pleased to note that, during the three years\r\nthat have passed since the Summit, this commitment has\r\nbeen translated into an enhanced endeavour to promote\r\nsocial development, in particular in the three areas of\r\nfocus of the Summit: poverty eradication, productive\r\nemployment and social integration. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation would like to commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report, contained in document A/53/211. The\r\nreport has provided us with updated information on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development by principal intergovernmental\r\nbodies, such as the Preparatory Committee for the Special\r\nSession of the General Assembly on the Implementation\r\nof the Outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, the Commission for Social Development\r\nand the Economic and Social Council, and by the United\r\nNations specialized agencies and the community of\r\nnations as a whole. A timetable has been devised for the\r\nintergovernmental process towards the year 2000, when\r\nthe special session will take place to review and assess\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the Summit.\r\nThe report acknowledges that many Governments\r\ncontinue to make efforts to uphold the commitments made\r\nat Copenhagen in 1995. We also share the view that the\r\npolitical momentum provided by the Summit needs to be\r\nfurther maintained and strengthened. However, we share\r\nthe concern, as manifested in the Secretary-General’s\r\nremarks, that\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\n“poverty, unemployment and social integration\r\ncontinue to be desperately serious problems which tear\r\nat the social fabric of many countries and are often the\r\nsource of persistent subregional and regional tensions”.\r\n(A/53/211, para. 22)\r\nWe believe that greater efforts should be further pursued to\r\nimplement the goals agreed at the Summit.\r\nWith regard to the activities of the United Nations\r\nspecialized agencies, my delegation commends the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) for its research\r\nactivities on linkages between poverty reduction and gender\r\nequality and between poverty reduction and inequality, as\r\nwell as in assessing the impacts of globalization on poverty\r\nand resource distribution. We would also like to commend\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) on its\r\ncontributions and achievements.\r\nAlong this line, an important international meeting on\r\nthe 20/20 Initiative will be held from 27 to 29 October\r\n1998 in Hanoi, the capital city of our country, to assess the\r\nprogress made since the 1996 Oslo Conference. The Hanoi\r\nconference will focus on the significance of investing in\r\nbasic social services and on how to increase the efficiency\r\nand effectiveness in resource spending on basic social\r\nservices and to optimize the quality and accessibility of\r\nservices. It is an honour for Viet Nam to host this\r\nconference in Hanoi and we are convinced that it will be a\r\nsuccess. The process known as the 20/20 Initiative\r\nrepresents a real endeavour of the countries concerned\r\nabout the implementation of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. We take this opportunity to extend our\r\nspecial appreciation to the Netherlands, Norway and\r\nUNICEF for the pursuit of this initiative.\r\nAt its resumed organizational session in May, as well\r\nas its substantive session in July this year, the Economic\r\nand Social Council focused its discussions on, among other\r\nthings, many social issues, such as women, children,\r\nrefugees, drug and crime control. The Council adopted a\r\nnumber of resolutions for coordination in activities by\r\nfunctional commissions and specialized agencies to conduct\r\nstudies on social issues, work out programmes and assist\r\ncountries in dealing with them effectively. Being a new\r\nmember of the Economic and Social Council, Viet Nam has\r\nactively participated in the Council’s deliberations.\r\nThe Commission for Social Development met in New\r\nYork from 10 to 20 February to consider the priority theme\r\nunder its restructured agenda and multi-year programme of\r\nwork, entitled “Promoting social integration and\r\nparticipation of all people, including disadvantaged and\r\nvulnerable groups and persons”. It adopted\r\nrecommendations for action at all levels and in the areas\r\nof promoting social integration through responsive\r\ngovernment, full participation in society, non-\r\ndiscrimination, tolerance, equality and social justice.\r\nThese recommendations also call for enhancing social\r\nprotection, reducing vulnerability and enhancing\r\nemployment opportunities for groups with specific needs;\r\nand doing away with violence, crime and the problem of\r\nillicit drugs and substance abuse. It also decided on the\r\npriority themes for the next session, to be held in\r\nFebruary 1999, as “Social services for all” and “Initiation\r\nof the overall review of the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the Summit”.\r\nThe Preparatory Committee’s organizational session,\r\nheld in New York from 19 to 22 May 1998, held a\r\ngeneral debate on the preparations for the special session\r\nand two panel discussions on the appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Summit. My\r\ndelegation takes note of the excellent work done by those\r\nbodies.\r\nFully aware of the urgent need for the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, Vietnam has continued its policy of\r\nrenovation — Doi moi — and achieved considerable\r\nsuccess in the socio-economic fields during the last few\r\nyears. Social development constitutes a major component\r\nof our country’s comprehensive long-term development\r\nstrategy and plans. I would like to focus on the most\r\noutstanding areas that have attracted much attention and\r\ninvestment by the Government, namely, employment,\r\ngender equality and poverty eradication.\r\nEmployment has increasingly been a major issue. It\r\nis estimated that in a population of 78 million, the\r\nworkforce will be over 40 million by the year 2000. The\r\nGovernment has made every effort to produce more job\r\nopportunities, especially for the young segment of the\r\nworkforce, and to reduce the level of unemployment\r\nthrough an integrated policy of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. In the context of the Asian financial crisis,\r\nthe task of looking for jobs is made even more difficult\r\ndue to the lack of adequate working efficiency and proper\r\ntraining of the general workforce. Only 12.2 per cent of\r\nworkers have the technical training needed in the modern\r\nwork place. At present, almost 70 per cent of the labour\r\nforce are involved in agriculture, while only 10.5 per cent\r\nwork in industry and construction and 19.7 per cent work\r\nin services. Along with economic development, the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\ncountry is trying to increase the number of skilled workers\r\nfrom 22 per cent to 25 per cent of the labour force, which\r\nwill require fundamental changes in the methodology and\r\norganization of vocational training. The workforce will also\r\nhave to be distributed appropriately in the economic sectors\r\nand geographic regions.\r\nIn an effort to deal with this situation and to mitigate\r\nthe cutbacks at State-owned enterprises, in July 1997 the\r\nGovernment of Viet Nam approved a national job creation\r\nprogramme which will last for four years, from 1997 to the\r\nyear 2000. Its basic goal is twofold: to create new jobs, and\r\nto protect those who are unemployed, which also means to\r\nensure employment for those who are capable of working\r\nand to implement measures to support jobless people. In\r\norder to achieve these goals, economic development must\r\ngenerate 5 million new jobs. Furthermore, the programme\r\nmust train 4.5 million people and increase the skilled\r\nworkforce to 25 per cent by the year 2000.\r\nThe programme also consists of three main measures\r\nfor effective implementation. First, government laws and\r\npolicies must strengthen national economic growth, the\r\ncornerstone of higher employment rates. For instance,\r\nindustrial and economic zones should focus on small\r\nenterprise development and appropriate technology to attract\r\nthe largest number of workers. Rural development should\r\nalso proceed with the goal of providing an adequate number\r\nof jobs. Secondly, workers should be provided with stable\r\njobs, not mass dismissals, and unemployment insurance\r\nshould gradually be applied across the economy. Thirdly,\r\ndirect assistance and job promotion for vulnerable people\r\nshould be strengthened. The programme will be supported\r\nby the National Fund for Job Creation, estimated at 4.8\r\ntrillion Vietnamese dong yearly, and other investment\r\nsources which include the State budget and government\r\nsponsorship.\r\nAdvancement of women continues to be a major\r\ncommitment of the Government of Viet Nam. Following\r\nthe Beijing Conference, the Government has formulated a\r\nnational plan of action which incorporates the objectives of\r\nthe national strategies and the programmes of action from\r\nvarious sectors, provinces and cities. This plan of action\r\nconsists of 11 concrete objectives and guidelines, some of\r\nwhich are to create jobs and equal opportunities for women\r\nin education and training so as to improve their educational\r\nlevel in various areas, to improve health care for and\r\nprotection of women and children, to enhance the role and\r\nposition of women in leadership and decision-making, to\r\nenhance the role of the family and to protect female\r\nchildren and facilitate their development in all fields. The\r\nNational Committee for the Advancement of Women\r\n(CFAW) has been designated to coordinate these\r\nactivities.\r\nRecently, a survey was completed on mechanisms\r\nfor the advancement of women at all levels. It has been\r\nrecommended, among other things, that gender awareness\r\nand policies be disseminated to all CFAW members at all\r\nlevels, that statistical indicators on gender be collected\r\nregularly, that a gender analysis framework be integrated\r\nin every organization’s working plan and that the human\r\nresources and facilities of CFAW be strengthened.\r\nThe most important area of all is poverty\r\neradication. In order to realize the national motto\r\n“Wealthy people, strong country, just and civilized\r\nsociety”, the Government of Viet Nam, with the\r\nassistance of the World Bank, has been carrying out a\r\nnational programme for development and poverty\r\nalleviation. During the last few years, priority has been\r\ngiven to poverty reduction and the elimination of hunger\r\nin mountainous and remote rural areas. The Government\r\nset up various funds for infrastructure construction,\r\nproviding roads, communication networks, electricity and\r\nclean water systems for the most disadvantaged groups of\r\npeople in those areas. Thanks to these efforts, in 1997\r\nalone there was a 1.53 per cent decrease in the number of\r\npoor households in the country. However, with the\r\nnegative impact of globalization, coupled with the Asian\r\nfinancial crisis, there remain many difficulties for the\r\nGovernment in dealing with the cause of poverty\r\neradication. In this regard, my delegation would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to express our high appreciation and\r\ngratitude to donor countries and the United Nations\r\nagencies, especially the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund for their effective\r\ncooperation and valuable assistance to Viet Nam.\r\nFinally, as we have entered the process of\r\npreparation for the International Year of Older Persons, to\r\nbe observed in 1999, my delegation would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to express its high appreciation for the\r\ninitiative taken by the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations on Thursday, 1 October, in launching the Year.\r\nThis activity fully corresponds with our national tradition\r\nof the younger generation and society always respecting\r\nthe wisdom of and caring for older persons. In this\r\nregard, the Government of Viet Nam is fully committed\r\nto the ultimate goal of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, namely to build a true “Society for all ages”.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nIn concluding, I would like to reiterate that the\r\nGovernment of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is fully\r\ncommitted to the objectives and principles contained in the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted in 1995. We will continue\r\nour cooperation with the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies in our common cause for social development.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): My delegation wishes to\r\nassociate itself with the statement made yesterday by the\r\nrepresentative of Indonesia on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China and to thank the Secretariat for providing us with\r\nthe documents before this Assembly. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/53/211, in\r\nparticular, contains useful information on follow-up\r\nactivities being undertaken by Governments and by the\r\nUnited Nations system since the adoption of General\r\nAssembly resolution 52/25 on the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nMy delegation fully endorses the call made by the\r\nAdministrative Committee on Coordination (ACC) for\r\norganizations of the United Nations system to “utilize fully\r\nexisting national-level mechanisms and frameworks”\r\n(A/53/211, para. 34), while ensuring that support for the\r\ntranslation of conference outcomes into concrete national\r\npolicies continues to remain a priority of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nIn keeping with the importance my delegation attaches\r\nto field coordination, we also welcome the workshop jointly\r\nsponsored by the ACC and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group, in Turin, Italy, in December 1997.\r\nThis workshop developed integrated guidance for the\r\nresident coordinator system for country-level follow-up to\r\nglobal conferences. We ask that this kind of activity be\r\ncontinued and, if possible, that it become an integral part of\r\nthe training for resident coordinators.\r\nThe adoption in June 1998 of the Declaration on\r\nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work by the\r\nInternational Labour Conference represents a further step in\r\npreserving the dignity of the worker as a human being. This\r\nis particularly important, as the human person is often\r\nignored in favour of the powerful gods of the market,\r\nwhich serves only to augment social exclusion and makes\r\nthe task of promoting social integration a Sisyphean one.\r\nMy delegation wishes to give special recognition to\r\nthe role of the Commission for Social Development, which\r\nhas primary responsibility for follow-up to the Copenhagen\r\nSummit. We fully endorsed the agreed conclusions on the\r\npriority theme for 1998 — “Promoting social integration\r\nand participation of all people, including disadvantaged\r\nand vulnerable groups and persons” — which was\r\nadopted by the Commission at its thirty-sixth session.\r\nThe agreed conclusions included recommendations\r\nfor action in promoting social integration at all levels,\r\nthrough, inter alia, responsive government, enhancing\r\nsocial protection, creating employment opportunities for\r\ngroups with specific needs and addressing violence, crime\r\nand the problem of illicit drugs and substance abuse as\r\nfactors of social disintegration.\r\nJamaica’s experience with the process of social\r\nintegration is similar to that of other countries of the\r\nEnglish-speaking Caribbean. In our societies, pluralist\r\ntendencies are quite evident, based upon the historical\r\nexperience of colonialism and the plantation economy,\r\nwhich brought together persons of diverse social, cultural,\r\nracial and ethnic backgrounds. Jamaica has achieved a\r\nremarkable degree of social integration over the years,\r\ndue largely to the breakdown of the traditional power\r\nrelations which were based on a hierarchy of race and\r\ncolour. The existence of a democratic political system has\r\nbeen a major contributor to this reduction in social\r\ndivisions.\r\nNevertheless, we are still faced with the challenge\r\nposed by the unequal distribution of wealth, power and\r\nprestige among the various social groups.\r\nIn order to overcome this challenge, Jamaica has\r\nadopted several strategies to promote greater participation\r\nof all groups in society in the economic, social and\r\ncultural development of the nation, from the community\r\nto the national level.\r\nRecognizing that these strategies require serious\r\ninvestment in social institutions, social capital and human\r\nresource capacity-building, within the framework of\r\npoverty eradication, the Government has already\r\nincorporated elements such as the following into its\r\nnational programme: human resource development,\r\nemphasizing the expansion of opportunities for education\r\nand skills training, including reform of the educational\r\nsystem at primary and secondary levels; a community-\r\nbased approach to development; the development of social\r\nskills, focusing primarily on the infusion of family life\r\neducation and related subjects in school curricula in order\r\nto strengthen the family as a basic social institution; an\r\nemployee share ownership programme; and the\r\nstrengthening of the justice system.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nIn all of these and other policy initiatives, the\r\nJamaican Government recognizes the special needs of\r\nvulnerable groups of society, as well as the special\r\nconditions of deprived urban communities and\r\nunderdeveloped rural areas.\r\nMy delegation participated actively in the\r\norganizational session of the Preparatory Committee for the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Social Summit\r\nin May this year, and we fully support the decisions made\r\nat that session. We note in particular decision III of the\r\nsession, which recommends that the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment be entrusted with the responsibility of acting\r\nas a forum for national reporting in the lead-up to the\r\nspecial session. We await with interest the general\r\nguidelines, structure and common framework for national\r\nreporting to be formulated by the Secretary-General, as\r\nrequested by the Preparatory Committee.\r\nThe Jamaican Government recognizes the importance\r\nof non-governmental organizations and the involvement of\r\ncivil society in the implementation and follow-up to the\r\nSummit’s Declaration and Programme of Action. In this\r\nregard, we wish to make special mention of the work of the\r\nInternational Council on Social Welfare (ICSW), which has\r\nbeen organizing regional and subregional non-governmental\r\norganization forums and other meetings on social\r\nimplementation.\r\nWith respect to the special session itself, Jamaica\r\nanticipates a full and intensive agenda, as we will be\r\ninvolved in the challenging task of assessing achievement\r\nof the goals set at Copenhagen. The Jamaican Government\r\nagrees that that session must not renegotiate the\r\ncommitments agreed at Copenhagen. We are fully\r\nconscious that the true measure of our commitment to the\r\nprinciples embodied in the Declaration must be\r\ndemonstrated in concrete actions.\r\nI therefore wish to reiterate my Government’s\r\nappreciation to the relevant agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem for their responsiveness to our various initiatives.\r\nWe look forward to expanding these and other\r\npartnerships as we seek effective global solutions to the\r\nserious problems of poverty, unemployment and social\r\ndisintegration.\r\nMs. Banerjee (India): It is my privilege to address the\r\nAssembly on the agenda item on the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nAllow me, on behalf of the Indian delegation, to join\r\nall those who have spoken before me in congratulating\r\nMr. Opertti on his well-deserved election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-third session. Let me\r\nalso express our sincere appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the highly informative reports that have been\r\nprepared and issued on this item and for the efforts and\r\ninitiatives of the Secretariat to advance the goals set by\r\nthe World Summit at Copenhagen.\r\nWe would also like to associate ourselves fully with\r\nthe statement made by Indonesia on behalf of the Group\r\nof 77 and China.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development marked\r\na watershed in the recognition by the international\r\ncommunity that development could not be limited simply\r\nto economic development or economic growth, but rather\r\nthat it would have to be seen in terms of the extent to\r\nwhich it benefited the human person in community with\r\nothers and contributed to wider social progress in larger\r\nfreedom. Specifically, it succeeded in arriving at a shared\r\nglobal commitment at the highest level to eradicating\r\npoverty, achieving full employment and strengthening\r\nsocial solidarity, and it increased the attention given to\r\nsocial issues by many countries and most international\r\norganizations. Together with the other United Nations\r\nglobal conferences of the 1990s, it has led to a\r\nsubstantially revised and more holistic agenda of\r\ndevelopment that, at least theoretically, places\r\nparticipatory government, sustainable development, human\r\nrights and equity at the centre of development.\r\nThe period of three years into the implementation of\r\nthe outcome of the World Summit is perhaps too short to\r\nhave yielded palpable or measurable progress at the field\r\nlevel in the lives of people all over the world. The\r\nyardstick of success must necessarily be the extent to\r\nwhich social goals highlighted by the Summit have been,\r\nor are being, mainstreamed or prioritized in both national\r\ndevelopment and international relations, in particular\r\ninternational economic relations. It can be gauged from\r\nthe extent to which institutions safeguarding social\r\ndevelopment, particularly in times of crisis, have evolved.\r\nIt can also be judged by the extent to which commitments\r\nmade at the Summit have been, or are being, honoured.\r\nAnother index could be the extent to which social\r\nconsiderations have become significant policy inputs in\r\nthe sphere of inter-State economic relations, bilateral or\r\nmultilateral.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nThe years of the mid-1990s, before and after the\r\nSocial Summit, witnessed a period of growth and\r\nimprovement in living standards many parts of the world,\r\nincluding a number of developing countries. It would be\r\ntempting to say that this period of growth and prosperity\r\nalso led to a reinforcement of the goals of social\r\ndevelopment and their centrality in economic transactions.\r\nBut the contrary is true: the suddenness and intensity of\r\nperiodic crises, of which the Asian crisis is only the latest\r\nexample, their ripple effects in other parts of the world and\r\nthe inability of the international system to anticipate or\r\ncontain them, have revealed the fragility of such progress\r\nand our incomprehension and helplessness before them.\r\nThe economic crisis has aggravated global inequalities\r\nand the marginalization of countries in relation to market-\r\ndriven prosperity at the international level, as well as\r\ndisparities at the national level. It has exposed a basic\r\ndisjunction between social goals and unfettered markets,\r\nparticularly short-term capital markets. It has underscored\r\nthe obvious fact that the long-term development of a large\r\npart of the developing world has not been adequately\r\nsupported by the international system. And it has\r\ndemonstrated our basic unpreparedness to deal with the\r\nsocial consequences of economic turbulence that is not\r\nalways, or entirely, of our own making. The three key\r\nobjectives of the Social Summit — the eradication of\r\npoverty, the goal of full employment and enhanced social\r\nintegration — have received serious setbacks in some parts\r\nof the world with the serious possibility of similar\r\nrepercussions elsewhere.\r\nUnder the multi-year programme of work to assess\r\nprogress in the implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nof the Summit, priority this year has been given to the\r\nquestion of social integration. Our delegation had an\r\nopportunity to present its views on some of the\r\npredicaments involved in this and related themes facing\r\ndeveloping countries at the thirty-sixth session of the\r\nCommission for Social Development. These were the\r\nprimacy of the challenge of poverty to social integration,\r\ngiven its magnitude, scale and global nature; the particular\r\nstrains on the social fabric posed by the difficulties of\r\naddressing old and new problems of social development in\r\nthe context of catching up with economic, social and living\r\nstandards achieved by the advanced industrial countries in\r\na much shorter time-frame, bearing in mind historical\r\ndisadvantages; the vulnerability not just of communities, but\r\nof entire countries, to marginalization on account of such\r\nhistorical disadvantages compounded by market forces; the\r\nimperative of economic growth for distributive justice, even\r\nas the goals of social development — eradication of\r\npoverty, productive employment, sustainable livelihood\r\nand social integration — have to be provided for in the\r\nprocess of growth; and the issue of steady and enhanced\r\nexternal financial resources in the form of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, long-term non-concessional\r\nfunding from multilateral institutions and private capital\r\nflows.\r\nIn the meantime, the Asian crisis has drawn attention\r\nto the devastating social implications of market behaviour\r\naccompanying globalization to date. Social development\r\ncan be seen on two axes: one straddling basic human\r\nrights values and fundamental freedoms which need to be\r\npursued independent of the economy, and the other\r\nstraddling poverty eradication, employment and social\r\nintegration, which are heavily dependent on the state of\r\nthe economy. The onslaught of the Asian crisis, and the\r\nmanner in which an essentially financial crisis has\r\nsnowballed into a major economic and social crisis in\r\nsome parts of the world, points out the inextricable\r\ninterrelationship between social and economic\r\ndevelopment. It is also a crucial input into the initiatives\r\nthat may be required for the follow-up to the social\r\nagenda beyond the special session in the year 2000.\r\nWhat is clear is that for the goals of the Social\r\nSummit to be fully realized for the developing countries,\r\nthree sets of initiatives are indispensable: a set of\r\neconomic policies and mechanisms that can provide short-\r\nterm stability and long-term growth and development; a\r\ncorresponding set of social policies and institutions built,\r\nas far as possible, into such policies; and the required\r\ndegree of international cooperation for development\r\nbroadly defined by the recent United Nations conferences.\r\nUnderpinning all three is the need for suitable institutional\r\nsupport.\r\nThe preparatory process for the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the implementation of the outcome\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development and further\r\ninitiatives is therefore taking place at a most opportune\r\ntime. A number of new ideas were brought up at the first\r\norganizational session by members, by the Secretariat and\r\nby a number of non-governmental organizations, which\r\nwe see as crucial partners in this endeavour. It would\r\nperhaps be best to reserve these items for more\r\nsubstantive debate at the organizational session next year.\r\nI would like next to turn to the relationship between\r\nthe United Nations and the international financial centres\r\nand institutions. Increased interaction between the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the international\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nfinancial institutions at the intergovernmental level and the\r\nstrengthening of the policy formulation capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations through the integration of the analytical,\r\nnormative and operational capacities of the United Nations\r\nin the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, have\r\nbegun to address the distance between the normative role of\r\nthe United Nations, particularly in the social sphere, and the\r\ninternational economic institutions that have a symbiotic\r\nrelationship with the market. But the distance is still too\r\ngreat. Discussions and decision-making within influential\r\neconomic and financial institutions and groupings, including\r\nthe Group of Seven industrialized countries, could also be\r\ninformed further by the goals of the Social Summit to\r\nwhich we are all committed.\r\nThe project of social development occupies that\r\ncritical area between development, broadly defined, and\r\nhuman rights. The three core issues of social development,\r\nas identified by the Social Summit can, and need to be,\r\napproached from both the development and human rights\r\nperspectives, and indeed may well provide the crucial link\r\nbetween the two. We see a two-way relationship between\r\nhuman rights and development, with participatory\r\ndemocracy as the crucial link. The task of social\r\ndevelopment, particularly because it involves people as\r\nactive agents of their destiny, therefore lies at the\r\nconfluence of democracy, development and human rights,\r\nand indeed, at the confluence of the State, the market and\r\ncivil society. But the most crucial variable undoubtedly\r\nremains the role of a cooperative international environment\r\nwhere the interests of developed and developing countries\r\nare seen as shared and complementary. A rights-based\r\napproach to development ultimately depends greatly on a\r\nsocial and international order in which all these rights and\r\npotentialities can be realized.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Al-Hariri (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): Three years have elapsed since the\r\nCopenhagen Summit and yet the international community\r\nhas still much to do in the area of social development in all\r\nits aspects, particularly as regards its cornerstone, namely\r\nthe human being, especially in view of the present\r\neconomic changes, whose effects will be felt in all\r\nsocieties.\r\nHere I wish to emphasize that my delegation supports\r\nthe statement made by the representative of Indonesia\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The\r\nCopenhagen Summit was a turning point. It was there that\r\nthe international community expressed its aspiration to\r\nhave a better tomorrow for humanity, a future of\r\nprosperity, of freedom, free from poverty, illness,\r\ndestitution, ignorance and other scourges that have beset\r\nall nations and societies.\r\nAs has clearly been shown in the last three years,\r\nsocial development could not merely be a set of\r\nmeasures. It is also the very pillar of prosperity for\r\nsociety. However the social objectives vary from one\r\ncountry to another, all cultures share in the interest in\r\nprosperity for the individual and the smooth functioning\r\nof society.\r\nIt is on the basis of this awareness that Syria started\r\nits overall development process. The aim was to develop\r\nthe free person, to foster his feeling of his human identity,\r\nto enhance his enjoyment of freedom and to develop his\r\npersonality, which interacts with his objectives and goals.\r\nOur policy aimed also at developing the entire potential\r\nand resources of our nation so as to increase national\r\nincome and to raise the living standards of our citizens.\r\nThus, development plans in my country have led to\r\nan increase in the achievements and rates of social\r\ndevelopment as well as to an increase in services for\r\nhealth, education and social services in the towns and in\r\nthe countryside. We have also augmented the levels of\r\neducation, food and health, while decreasing appreciably\r\nmaternal and infant mortality.\r\nThis is all part of our State policy to create an\r\nenvironment that is conducive to creating conditions of\r\nsocial development, including poverty eradication, the\r\ntotal participation of women in development, social\r\nintegration, the provision of productive employment for\r\npeople, and the elimination of unemployment. In this\r\nrespect, Syria has ratified 46 labour conventions,\r\nincluding the convention that has a special provision on\r\nwomen’s employment. Likewise, various sectors are being\r\ngiven increased and comprehensive attention. Free\r\neducation is provided at all levels. It is mandatory at the\r\nprimary education level and to all citizens without\r\ndiscrimination. The same applies to health services that\r\nare provided by the State free of charge to everyone.\r\nThe development plan adopted by my country covers\r\nall sectors and we attach the same importance to all areas\r\ncovered. No segment of the population is excluded from\r\nthis process.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nThe Copenhagen Summit adopted a number of\r\ncommitments, some to be implemented by national\r\nGovernments and others by the international community.\r\nHowever, we find that three years after that Summit,\r\ninternational cooperation has declined to its lowest mark.\r\nThe developed States have not met the obligations that\r\nthey undertook at the Summit. Thus the developing\r\ncountries have shouldered their responsibilities despite their\r\nlimited resources; this did not stop the deterioration of\r\neconomic and social conditions, and the present state of\r\nimbalance has persisted. Therefore, as we look forward to\r\nthe year 2000, we have to reaffirm the need to follow up on\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit and the Programme of Action. We have also to\r\nstress the importance of international cooperation aiming at\r\nnational and international social development cooperation\r\nbased on mutual respect and community of interest. In the\r\ncontext of that cooperation, the developed countries would\r\ncommit themselves to meeting their obligations adopted in\r\nCopenhagen in order to assist in eliminating many of the\r\nscourges that are prevalent in all societies, and which have\r\na great impact on them.\r\nForeign occupation is a great obstacle to social\r\ndevelopment and social integration. We must stress here\r\nthat Israel’s occupation of the Syrian Golan has led to the\r\nemigration of nearly half a million Syrian citizens from\r\ntheir territory. During that emigration, they suffered from\r\npoverty and various privations. Thus, many women became\r\nthe breadwinners of their families after their husbands were\r\nmartyred or arrested. Despite the State’s efforts to ensure\r\nthe minimum living requirements of these people, there is\r\nneed for more resources, and more expansion of services.\r\nEvery year Syria is obliged to assume greater\r\nresponsibilities because of the Israeli occupation, which\r\ncontrols the natural resources of Golan, which it usurps and\r\npillages. The occupation is creating and expanding\r\nsettlements with the aim of changing the demographic\r\ncharacter of the region. Thus the plans and programmes for\r\neconomic and social development in my country are\r\nnegatively impacted by this situation.\r\nMy delegation participated in the preparatory work for\r\nthe special session to be held in the year 2000 to follow up\r\nthe work done in Copenhagen, and we would stress here\r\nthat we must at all costs see to it that the necessary\r\nconsultations are completed in order to continue the\r\npreparations in complete transparency and with the\r\nparticipation of all in a constructive spirit so that the\r\nsession will be a success.\r\nThis is particularly important since the session will\r\nbe held at the dawn of a new millennium, which requires\r\nit to be a unique session characterized by its future impact\r\non the lives and prosperity of peoples. We hope therefore\r\nthat the commitments undertaken in Copenhagen will be\r\nmet in order to ensure effective international cooperation.\r\nWe will agree that man’s personality is the real\r\nwealth of any society, nation and humanity at large.\r\nTherefore, we need to take care of it, enable it to attain\r\nintellectual horizons and visions suitable for development,\r\nand to be coupled with values and ideals to protect it\r\nfrom degradation and delinquency. We should also bestow\r\nupon man’s personality new skills which would make it\r\ncapable of adapting to a changing environment and to\r\nhelp it interact with such changes in a positive manner.\r\nAll this means that we should act seriously to create\r\na world where relations would be based on understanding\r\nand equality — relations that make it possible to create\r\nconditions of prosperity and happiness for people, away\r\nfrom poverty and injustice. Our striving should be for a\r\nworld with no hegemony, colonialism or foreign\r\noccupation, a world where man would exercise his\r\nfundamental rights as one integrated unity of civil,\r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights leading to\r\nhis development and his preparation to play a positive\r\nrole in society.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Egypt.\r\nMr. Abdel Aziz (Egypt) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I wish at the outset to say that the delegation of\r\nEgypt endorses the statement made earlier by the\r\nrepresentative of Indonesia on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nThe struggle to promote social development is an\r\nimportant objective in today’s world. In addition, the\r\nsupport of efforts to attain social progress and justice, and\r\nto improve the standard of living of people has become\r\nan urgent issue, in the light of the rising aspirations of\r\npeople the world over, and their call for giving high\r\npriority to the social aspect of development. These\r\nelements are closely interrelated, and are affected by the\r\nbroader range of social and economic questions, to the\r\npoint of constituting a holistic and indivisible entity that\r\ncan have either a positive or a negative impact on\r\ninternational stability, peace and security.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nOn this basis, Egypt recognizes the importance of\r\nsocial and economic issues, and, like other States that\r\nparticipated in the World Summit for Social Development\r\nin Copenhagen, has committed itself to making every effort\r\nto confront problems in that sphere by creating an\r\neconomic, political, social, cultural and ecological climate\r\npropitious for the attainment of social development,\r\neradicating poverty, expanding employment, combating\r\nunemployment and fostering social integration.\r\nLet me here stress two major points. We continue to\r\nstress the importance of being guided by them when dealing\r\nwith questions relating to social development. First, we\r\nmust respect different cultures and civilizations; nothing can\r\njustify imposing one’s lifestyle on those who reject it or\r\nforcing one’s practices on those who do not want them.\r\nSecondly, although we concede that the principal, central\r\nrole in any process of social development should be played\r\nby individual Governments, it is also true that success in\r\nsuch governmental efforts depends on a favourable\r\ninternational environment, including factors such as trade,\r\ninvestment, the provision of financial resources, technical\r\nassistance and the transfer of technology.\r\nIn March, the Secretary-General addressed letters to\r\nheads of State or Government, in which, as quoted in\r\nparagraph 22 of document A/53/211, he stated that, despite\r\nefforts by many Governments to implement the decisions of\r\nthe Summit, “poverty, unemployment and social\r\ndisintegration continue to be desperately serious problems\r\nwhich tear at the social fabric of many countries and are\r\noften the source of persistent subregional and regional\r\ntensions”.\r\nOn that basis, and at a time when we demand of\r\nourselves and of other States to redouble our efforts in the\r\neconomic and social sphere, we welcome the reference in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General to the continued strong\r\ncommitment of many Governments to implementing the\r\noutcome of the Copenhagen Summit and to strengthening\r\nthe political momentum achieved by that Summit in 1995,\r\nby moving forward in formulating national programmes,\r\nplans and strategies to promote social development through\r\nthe elimination of poverty, the creation of jobs, fostering\r\nthe development of human resources, creating social\r\ninvestment funds and devoting a larger portion of their\r\nbudgets to the social sector.\r\nIn that connection, Egypt submitted a report on its\r\nnational follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit to the\r\nCommission for Social Development at its thirty-sixth\r\nsession. Here, Egypt joined the rest of the international\r\ncommunity in exchanging experiences and drawing\r\nlessons from one another in this area. Egypt reported that\r\nthe main elements of its strategy are, first, to ensure as\r\nconstant as possible an increase in development rates, and\r\nconsistent support for our efforts in that regard, always\r\nmindful of the need to control and slow demographic\r\ngrowth. Secondly, we must make optimal use of all\r\nhuman potential without marginalizing any sector or\r\ngroup, stress human development and promote social\r\nconsciousness. Thirdly, we must further strengthen\r\ndemocratic practices and maintain the continuity and\r\nstability of our constitutional institutions. In this context,\r\nwe must be committed to legitimacy and the supremacy\r\nof law, and must endeavour to protect human rights and\r\npublic and private freedoms in order to ensure that all\r\ncitizens effectively participate in running their country’s\r\naffairs and in decision-making, with a view to achieving\r\nsocial integration.\r\nLet me make special reference to the problem of\r\npoverty, which poses one of the main challenges facing\r\ncontemporary society. All Governments, and the\r\ninternational community as a whole, must redouble their\r\nefforts to address this challenge, especially as we are all\r\ncommitted to attaining the goal of eradicating poverty, as\r\na moral, social, political, economic and human obligation\r\nincumbent upon us all. Egypt has begun to implement a\r\nwhole series of integrated policy measures aimed at\r\nreducing poverty, promoting human development and\r\nachieving a 6 per cent a year increase in our gross\r\nnational product by the year 2000.\r\nEgypt has seen to it that those with limited incomes\r\nincrease their participation in work and production\r\nthrough easy credit, professional training, fostering the\r\nrole of volunteerism and civic society, and strengthening\r\nsocial safety-net — specifically our Social Development\r\nFund. This Fund is no longer confined to minimizing the\r\nnegative fallout from the economic and social reform\r\nprocess but now aims to support development in the areas\r\nof education, literacy, basic social and health services,\r\nfamily planning, raising living standards and fighting\r\nunemployment.\r\nAs we begin preparing for a year 2000 special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on the implementation\r\nof the outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, which Switzerland has made the generous\r\noffer to host, Egypt expresses the hope that the special\r\nsession will be the focus of serious attention preparation\r\nand consensus-building by all to ensure its success. In\r\nthat connection, we stress that the overriding objective of\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nthe session will not be to renegotiate the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, but to reaffirm them\r\nand to evaluate how far we have come in the process of\r\nimplementing them. The main objective also includes the\r\nformulation of recommendations and concrete initiatives to\r\nbolster efforts aimed at the full implementation of the\r\nresults of the Copenhagen Summit.\r\nThat will undoubtedly require joint efforts by all\r\nparties involved in the preparatory work for the session, at\r\nthe national, the regional and the international levels. Here\r\nI must mention the critical role of all the bodies,\r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem in the preparations for the year 2000 special session.\r\nNor should I omit mention of the important role of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and civil society in general in\r\nfollowing up and implementing the Copenhagen Programme\r\nof Action at the national and regional levels.\r\nI wish in conclusion to reaffirm the importance of and\r\ninterdependence of national, regional and international\r\nefforts aiming at bolstering social development in all forms\r\nand in all areas. We appeal to all States and Governments\r\nto fulfil their commitments in this regard, especially in the\r\nareas of mobilizing resources and providing technical\r\nassistance to developing countries. Social development is a\r\ncollective international responsibility that has an impact on\r\nour lives and on the future of our world.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): The 1995 World Summit for\r\nSocial Development showed that there was a global\r\nconsensus that people must be at the centre of our\r\ndevelopment efforts and an acknowledgement of the close\r\ninterlinkage between the social and the economic\r\ndimensions of development. A central aspect of that\r\nconsensus is the importance of investing in people’s health\r\nand education, not only for their own benefit but for the\r\nbenefit of society at large. Norway is fully committed to the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the Summit through\r\naction at the local, national and international levels.\r\nThe goal of universal access to basic social services\r\ncuts across all three key objectives of the Social Summit.\r\nHealthy, educated people have a better chance for\r\nproductive employment and sustainable livelihoods. Only\r\nby giving people an opportunity to lead healthy and\r\nproductive lives can we help break the vicious circle of\r\npoverty. Providing access for all to basic education — not\r\nleast of all for girls — is an effective way to promote\r\nsocial integration.\r\nThe Social Summit identified an instrument to\r\nfacilitate joint action by developed and developing\r\ncountries towards this goal: the 20/20 Initiative. Norway\r\nhas taken a special interest in translating it into action. In\r\nApril 1996, representatives of 38 Governments and 10\r\nmultilateral organizations met in Oslo to review strategies\r\nand modalities to implement this initiative. A\r\ncomprehensive analysis of the 20/20 Initiative and its\r\npotential was undertaken, and the outcome of the meeting\r\nis reflected in the Oslo Consensus on 20/20.\r\nLater this month, as mentioned by the representative\r\nof Viet Nam, government representatives and other key\r\nactors will again gather, in Hanoi, to take stock of the\r\nprogress made since the Oslo meeting and to discuss\r\nways and means of bringing the Initiative further ahead.\r\nTogether with the Government of the Netherlands, we are\r\npleased to sponsor the Hanoi meeting, and we hope that\r\nit will bring us closer to the goal of universal access to\r\nbasic social services.\r\nIn addition to our mutual commitment along the\r\nlines of the 20/20 Initiative, another long-standing target\r\nneeds a reaffirmed commitment by developed countries:\r\nthe agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product\r\nfor official development assistance. It is regrettable that\r\nindustrialized countries are increasingly distancing\r\nthemselves from this target. Norway, which has been well\r\nabove this target for decades, is actively seeking to\r\ncounter the growing donor fatigue and intends to further\r\nincrease its own official development assistance in the\r\nyears ahead.\r\nFor the poorest and most heavily indebted\r\ndeveloping countries the debt problem represents one of\r\nthe main obstacles to development. Urgent action is\r\nneeded to end the unsustainable debt burden of these\r\ncountries. The Norwegian Government has launched a\r\ncomprehensive national debt relief strategy as a\r\ncontribution towards this end. Its objective is to enable\r\nthese countries to enter the next millennium with a debt\r\nsituation that is not an impediment to economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The strategy includes concrete proposals on\r\nhow Norway can support and strengthen multilateral\r\nmechanisms already in place. As part of the strategy,\r\nNorway will grant unilateral debt reductions on a case-by-\r\ncase basis on top of the reductions made under\r\nmultilateral operations.\r\nThe number of children being exploited through\r\nchild labour seems to be on the increase. The girl child is\r\nparticularly vulnerable, although her labour is often less\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nvisible. The financial crisis currently affecting many\r\ncountries is magnifying the problem. The AIDS epidemic\r\nadds to this burden by leaving many children with an\r\nuncertain future as orphans needing to fend for themselves.\r\nThese challenges need to be met by action. The Norwegian\r\nGovernment gives high priority to this work, which we see\r\nas both a human rights issue and a development issue.\r\nAlmost a year has passed since the International\r\nConference on Child Labour in Oslo, where 40 countries\r\nagreed on an Agenda for Action on Child Labour. This\r\nAgenda points out a number of factors that can help\r\neliminate child labour over time. Access to education,\r\nappropriate legislation and mobilization of civil society are\r\nall keys to bringing about change, as is support for\r\ncommunity action designed to reduce the burdens of\r\nworking children. We should now focus on how to promote\r\nand support the development of national plans of action in\r\ncountries that experience child labour problems and that are\r\ncommitted to this process.\r\nEnabling people with disabilities to participate fully\r\nand actively in society is an important part of our efforts to\r\ncreate a society for all. The United Nations Standard Rules\r\non the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with\r\nDisabilities is a key tool towards this end. Priority areas for\r\naction should be to ensure accessibility, equality and full\r\nparticipation in society for people with disabilities and to\r\nfacilitate their participation in planning and policy-making.\r\nThe decision to designate 1999 as the International\r\nYear of Older Persons has been warmly welcomed in\r\nNorway, both by the Government and by the numerous\r\nNorwegian non-governmental organizations working in the\r\nfield of older people. A national committee has been\r\nestablished. Some key topics for our celebration of the Year\r\nwill be the rights of older people, appropriate care, lifelong\r\nlearning and solidarity between generations.\r\nNorway will take an active part in the preparatory\r\nprocess leading up to the special session of the General\r\nAssembly in the year 2000. The purpose of the special\r\nsession must be to review the implementation of the results\r\nof the Summit, but also to consider further actions and\r\ninitiatives. In this process we must encourage contributions\r\nfrom all relevant actors, not least from the community of\r\nnon-governmental organizations and other parts of civil\r\nsociety.\r\nIn his recent address to the General Assembly, our\r\nSecretary-General expressed his happiness about the fruitful\r\ncooperation over the past year between the United Nations\r\nand non-State actors, in particular in the processes leading\r\nup to the Convention on anti-personnel landmines and the\r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court. These\r\npositive experiences should be built upon in our\r\npreparations for the special session.\r\nMr. Bamba (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I would like to state at the outset that Côte\r\nd’Ivoire associates itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Indonesia on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nWhen the heads of State or Government adopted the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action in\r\nMarch 1995 no one could have predicted that a serious\r\nfinancial crisis linked to globalization, whose shock waves\r\nare still spreading, would completely call into question —\r\nat least as far as some countries are concerned — the\r\nreasonable expectations for economic growth and social\r\nprogress.\r\nThe social consequences of this crisis are disastrous.\r\nDaily in the hardest hit countries 15,000 people are losing\r\ntheir jobs, thus swelling the ranks of the poor and the\r\nmarginalized. Social safety nets, stretched to the limit, are\r\nproving unable to meet the growing needs of those\r\nstripped of their livelihood.\r\nFaced with this unprecedented challenge, the\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular those in Africa, are\r\nseeing the flow of external resources dry up, especially in\r\nterms of official development assistance, while the\r\nalready unbearable external debt burden only grows\r\nheavier.\r\nSuch a situation is cause for concern and casts a pall\r\nof uncertainty over the commitments entered into at\r\nCopenhagen and at other major international conferences.\r\nWe should not become discouraged, however. What we\r\nshould do is review our strategies and attune our policies\r\nin order to make the human person, more than ever, the\r\nfocus of development.\r\nMy delegation in this connection pays tribute to the\r\nwork of the United Nations Development Programme and\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund, which, by\r\nemphasizing the Human Development Index, have\r\nfocused attention on social indicators such as education,\r\nhealth, drinking-water availability and improved basic\r\nsocial services. It is up all of us, together with the\r\nexpertise of the bilateral and multilateral development\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nagencies, to investigate ways of raising or at least\r\nmaintaining the level of social indicators for our peoples.\r\nAmong the questions before our Assembly is one that\r\nwe believe to be key: what measures we must envisage to\r\nweave a social safety net for our peoples in general, and for\r\nthe most vulnerable among them in particular, in order to\r\nguarantee for them, the crisis notwithstanding, access to\r\nbasic social services.\r\nThe Government of Côte d’Ivoire has always, in its\r\nefforts, placed the full development of people’s potential at\r\ncentre stage. The President of the Republic clearly spelled\r\nout this basic concern in his policy address of 26 August\r\n1995:\r\n“To bring about a more homogenous society, in\r\nparticular through steps designed to improve quickly\r\nand substantially the living conditions of the most\r\ndisadvantaged in terms of housing, health, education\r\nand basic conditions of life in both rural and urban\r\nareas.”\r\nHe is speaking here of the third track of the presidential\r\nprogramme, whose implementation resulted in increased\r\nsocial investment, reflecting the irrevocable commitment of\r\nour Government to reaching, for its part, the goals set at the\r\nCopenhagen Summit.\r\nI would stress that the relevant steps are being taken\r\nwithin a well thought out framework that is based on a\r\nnational programme to fight poverty adopted in June 1997.\r\nIn the educational field, the investment budget went\r\nfrom 16 billion CFA francs ($32 million) in 1992 to 35\r\nbillion CFA francs ($70 million) in 1997 — a nearly 100\r\nper cent increase in the space of five years. It is noteworthy\r\nhere that elementary school expenditures account for 45 per\r\ncent of the overall educational budget. Moreover, 968\r\nelementary schoolrooms were built over the period 1993\r\nthrough 1997, 49 per cent of them in rural areas. This\r\nresulted in an increase in the rate of enrolment from 67 per\r\ncent in 1992 to 72 per cent in 1997.\r\nAltogether, for the period 1994 through 2001, we\r\nanticipate the construction of 5,000 new classrooms and the\r\nrefurbishing of 6,000 more, requiring investments totalling\r\nalmost 50 billion CFA francs ($100 million).\r\nIn the areas of housing and basic living conditions, the\r\nGovernment is undertaking to build low-income housing,\r\nrebuild run-down neighbourhoods and expand social\r\ninfrastructures. These steps will be buttressed by a major\r\nhousing programme, involving 12,000 low-income units,\r\nthat will involve projects initiated by the Government and\r\ncarried out by the private sector in 1998 and 1999.\r\nAt the village level, 1,330 housing units were built\r\nin 1997, versus 190 in 1994 and 1996.\r\nAs concerns hydraulics and the improvement of\r\nbasic social services, we have acted to ensure a reliable\r\nsupply of drinking water in both rural and urban areas. In\r\nurban areas, 37 drinking-water distribution centres were\r\nbuilt from 1995 through 1997, and in rural areas 1,188\r\nwells were drilled, resulting in one water-supply system\r\nfor every 580 inhabitants.\r\nIn the health-care field, which has always been a\r\npriority concern for the Government of Côte d’Ivoire, a\r\nnumber of steps have been taken to improve our people’s\r\naccess to basic health care. The strategy designed to\r\ntranslate all of this into reality involves the continued\r\nrestoration of existing infrastructures and the construction\r\nof new health centres. As a result, three major university\r\nand regional hospital centres were refurbished and\r\nequipped, and some 40 new dispensaries were built in the\r\ncapital as well as in the rest of the country.\r\nMoreover, these steps are being complemented on\r\nthe one hand by the implementation and restructuring of\r\nmajor health programmes concerning, inter alia, AIDS, an\r\nexpanded vaccination programme, Buruli’s ulcer and\r\nGuinea worm, and on the other hand stepped-up training\r\nfor health-care personnel..\r\nSince 1994 the public funds allocated to health care\r\nhave consistently increased, reaching 99 billion CFA\r\nfrancs ($198 million) in 1997. The result of this policy\r\nhas been a significant improvement in nationwide health\r\ncare coverage, as the following figures demonstrate.\r\nThere was one rural dispensary for every 9,331\r\ninhabitants in 1997, as against one for every 11,931 in\r\n1994 — an increase in the number of dispensaries from\r\n532 to 750 for the period in question. There was also one\r\nmaternity hospital for every 8,613 women of childbearing\r\nage in 1997, versus one for every 15,394 in 1994,\r\nreflecting an increase in the number of such facilities\r\nfrom 190 to 384 for that period. Furthermore, there is\r\nnow one physician for every 9,000 inhabitants, versus one\r\nfor every 11,111 in 1988. And the immunization rate\r\nwent from 60 per cent in 1996 to 70 per cent in 1997,\r\nwhich trend should allow us by the year 2000 to wipe out\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\npolio and neonatal tetanus as well as to check the spread of\r\nleprosy.\r\nOur Government’s efforts also have centred not only\r\non regularly supplying public health facilities with\r\nmedication but also on driving down the cost of that\r\nmedication, in particular by promoting generic medicines,\r\nincreasing medication imports and facilitating the\r\nestablishment of pharmaceutical plants.\r\nGiven the current globalization-dominated context,\r\nwhich I have already touched on, Côte d’Ivoire does not\r\nintend to wage alone the fight to improve our people’s\r\nhealth. On the contrary, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire is\r\ndetermined to wage that fight within the framework of an\r\nactive regional solidarity and international cooperation.\r\nThis determination reaches the very highest level, as\r\ndemonstrated by the personal involvement of the head of\r\nState of Côte d’Ivoire, who himself has launched several\r\ninitiatives and taken a number of steps towards better health\r\nin Africa and throughout the world.\r\nPresident Bédié, who was Africa’s representative at\r\nthe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the World\r\nHealth Organization, in addressing that body called to mind\r\nthe serious economic and financial crisis and its\r\nunfavourable impact on the social sectors in general and on\r\nhealth in particular. He listed the health-care challenges\r\nfacing Africa, stressing major new problems such as AIDS\r\nand Buruli’s ulcer. Finally he exhorted all countries to\r\nendeavour in a spirit of national and international solidarity\r\nso that better health for all in the twenty-first century can\r\nbecome a reality.\r\nHe also highlighted the connection between poverty\r\nand health; the impact of globalized trade and of technology\r\non health; the effectiveness of cooperation in the field of\r\ninternational health care and how non-health-related factors\r\nimpede the advancement of health care at the international\r\nlevel; the relationship between health and development; and\r\nthe relationship between the free-market system and\r\nuniversal access to care.\r\nAnother example of Côte d’Ivoire’s commitment to\r\nbetter health at the regional level was the initiative of the\r\nIvorian President at the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) summit in June 1998 in Ougadougou to propose the\r\ncreation of an African fund to fight AIDS and to take all\r\nnecessary steps to ensure the launching of the African\r\ninitiative against malaria. The heads of State or Government\r\nof the OAU hailed this initiative and adopted two\r\nresolutions designed to step up the fight against these two\r\nmajor scourges that are visiting suffering and death upon\r\nAfrica.\r\nSo far as the difficulties Africans face in obtaining\r\nanti-retrovirus treatment, the Ivorian President called\r\nattention to the fact that it is a flagrant injustice that\r\naccess to such treatments varies according to the level of\r\neconomic development. Chosen along with Uganda, Chile\r\nand Viet Nam to participate in the pilot phase of the\r\nUNAIDS initiative regarding access to anti-retrovirus\r\ntreatments, Côte d’Ivoire has tirelessly sought to win over\r\nnew partners, such as the European Union and major\r\npharmaceutical companies of the northern hemisphere.\r\nThese efforts, combined with those of other development\r\npartners made possible the launching of the initiative in\r\nAugust of this year.\r\nAs a sign of its commitment, Côte d’Ivoire has\r\nestablished a fund of 600 million CFA francs for the\r\ninitiative. Thus, in conjunction with other African\r\ncountries and development partners, we have prepared the\r\nway to fight with new vigour and solidarity against this\r\ndisease, the diverse effects of which spare no nation.\r\nAfrican countries must be assisted in their efforts to\r\nensure the provision of basic social services and to live\r\nup to the commitments they made at the Social Summit:\r\nto wipe out poverty, fight unemployment and ensure the\r\nsocial integration of marginalized people.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to reaffirm\r\nhere the appeal the Secretary-General made to the\r\nmember States of the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development — to take vigorous action\r\nfor Africa in the following five priority areas: first,\r\nincreasing the volume and quality of official development\r\nassistance to Africa; secondly, converting into grants the\r\nentire outstanding balance of the official debts of the\r\npoorest African countries; thirdly, expanding access to the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative; fourthly,\r\nopening markets to African exports and facilitating\r\nAfrican countries’ access to them; and fifthly,\r\nencouraging investment in Africa.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): The 1995 World Summit\r\nfor Social Development can be put on the list of major\r\nglobal events of the last decade. It was at that forum that\r\nconcrete targets and collective commitments aimed at\r\nensuring social progress and better living conditions were\r\ndefined. The commitments made in Copenhagen represent\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nsolemn pledges which, though not legally binding,\r\nconstitute strong ethical and moral imperatives.\r\nThe statements made yesterday and today by previous\r\nspeakers have vividly demonstrated the continued adherence\r\nof Member States to the fulfilment of obligations they\r\nundertook in Copenhagen. At the same time, many\r\nrepresentatives outlined problems and difficulties that prove\r\nthat the follow-up to the 1995 World Summit has been far\r\nfrom satisfactory.\r\nIn his letter to the Secretary-General in May this year,\r\nthe President of Ukraine shared the Secretary-General’s\r\nconcern that\r\n“poverty, unemployment and social disintegration\r\ncontinue to be desperately serious problems which tear\r\nat the social fabric of many countries and are often the\r\nsource of persistent subregional and regional tensions”.\r\n(A/53/211, para. 22)\r\nTo address these problems effectively, the President of\r\nUkraine emphasized that much more was required, through\r\nnational action as well as international cooperation.\r\nIt was widely acknowledged in the course of the\r\nrecent general debate that the main feature of the present\r\nstage of development of the world community is the\r\nglobalization of political, social, economic and humanitarian\r\nlife. On the one hand, recent years have been marked by\r\nsome of the negative effects of globalization. The financial\r\ncrises in Asia and in Russia, whose repercussions have been\r\nacutely felt all over the world, serve as the most recent\r\nexample of this.\r\nOn the other hand, a great advantage of globalization\r\nis the opportunity to share experiences and to learn from\r\neach other’s achievements and difficulties, to promote an\r\nexchange of new ideas and to resolve problems of\r\nindividual regions and countries by taking advantage of the\r\nworld’s best experience.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development and further initiatives, to be held in the\r\nyear 2000, will become a timely test for all of us as regards\r\nthe capability of the international community as a whole\r\nand of individual Member States to respond effectively to\r\nthe challenges of today.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Secretary-General, in\r\ndocument A/53/211, and fully support the opinion that,\r\namong the main goals of the special session should be to\r\nreaffirm and not to renegotiate the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, as well as to\r\nreview their implementation since 1995. While assessing\r\nnational, regional and global initiatives elaborated in this\r\nregard, the special session should pay additional attention\r\nto the impact of globalization; to an integrated approach\r\nto poverty eradication; to the promotion of full\r\nemployment and of social integration based on the\r\nenhancement and protection of human rights; and to the\r\ncreation of an economic, political, social, cultural and\r\nlegal environment that would enable people to enhance\r\ntheir social development.\r\nIn our opinion, the organizational session of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the special session has laid\r\ndown a good basis for further work in this direction. Our\r\ndelegation is pleased by the growing role in this process\r\nof the Commission for Social Development. We would\r\nalso like to note the combined efforts aimed at\r\nstreamlining the Summit follow-up made by the wide\r\nrange of different bodies of the United Nations system —\r\nin particular, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the\r\nInternational Labour Organization, the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund and the Bretton Woods institutions — as\r\nwell as the active involvement of non-governmental\r\norganizations to this end.\r\nWe welcome the initiative of the Government of\r\nSwitzerland to host the special session in the year 2000 in\r\nGeneva. We also highly appreciate its readiness to assist\r\nthose countries that do not have representatives in\r\nGeneva.\r\nThe implementation of the decisions of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit remains a very important component\r\nof Ukraine’s strategy in the area of social development.\r\nThe President and the Government of Ukraine are making\r\nevery effort to ensure the successful realization of the\r\nrelevant national programme and of a number of\r\nlegislative acts. The objective is to create a system of\r\nsocial relationships adapted to the current market\r\nconditions and environment; promote social integration,\r\nsocial justice, equal rights and opportunities for all; and\r\nensure the rights of national minorities. The most recent\r\nstep towards this end is the establishment of the national\r\ncommittee in charge of the implementation of the goals of\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons.\r\nThe Government of Ukraine continues to focus its\r\nefforts on solving the problems of youth, women,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nchildren, the disabled and other vulnerable groups of the\r\npopulation, who should not be consigned to the margins of\r\nsociety by the social and economic difficulties of an\r\neconomy in transition.\r\nUkraine will continue to strictly adhere to its\r\nCopenhagen commitments and will take an active part in\r\nthe process of preparing for the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe believe that the consolidation of efforts by all\r\nMember States aimed at overcoming the existing problems\r\nand at creating an environment for further economic and\r\nsocial progress will help achieve the goals of the World\r\nSocial Summit. In this regard, I would like to quote the\r\nwell-known British statesman and novelist, Benjamin\r\nDisraeli, who wrote more than a century ago, “The secret\r\nof success is constancy to purpose.” We are persistent in\r\nour will to contribute to the achievement of the goals of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit in the interests of and to the benefit of\r\nthe whole of humankind.\r\nMr. Shahid (Bangladesh): The international\r\ncommunity identified ways and means of addressing the\r\nchallenges of social development at the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in\r\n1995. We now look forward to the year 2000, when we\r\nshall review the progress achieved in implementing the\r\noutcome of the Summit.\r\nThe current global economic instability has had\r\nadverse consequences for societies. Measures for attaining\r\nsocial development have stalled as a result. The least\r\ndeveloped countries have suffered most. Their inadequate\r\nresource base has put them in a most difficult situation to\r\ncontinue their efforts for social development. Social\r\ndisintegration, endemic poverty, lack of employment and\r\nweak safety nets for vulnerable groups such as women,\r\nchildren and the elderly have compounded the problem\r\nfurther. Their collective impact may result in a\r\ndevelopmental crisis which will hurt the weak and the\r\nmarginalized.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nreport on the implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development. We fully endorse the\r\nstatement of the representative of Indonesia on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China. Given the time constraint, we\r\nwould like to flag a few issues of specific concern to us.\r\nFirst, it is clear that although measures have been\r\ntaken at the national, regional and international levels, much\r\nmore remains to be done for the complete implementation\r\nof the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit. The\r\nSecretary-General also raised this matter in his report. We\r\nbelieve that the best way to progress is to ensure that\r\nsocial issues are not overshadowed by economic ones,\r\ngiven the present global financial instability. We must not\r\nsacrifice those at the periphery in our efforts to engineer\r\na speedy global economic revival.\r\nSecondly, for implementing the outcome of the\r\nCopenhagen Summit at the national level, innovative\r\nmeasures are needed. In our efforts for poverty\r\neradication and social development, we have seen the\r\nusefulness of micro-credit as a tool. It has not only\r\naddressed issues of poverty, but by increasing economic\r\nactivity, it has also generated employment. By\r\nempowering women, it has had a number of fallout\r\neffects, including better sanitation and hygiene, increase\r\nin the number of schoolgoing children and more caloric\r\nintake.\r\nThirdly, while it is primarily the responsibility of\r\nnational Governments to implement the commitments\r\nmade at the Summit, it is also clear that without\r\ninternational cooperation and assistance, it will not be\r\npossible to do so. The United Nations has a critical role\r\nto play in this regard, and the Secretary-General’s report\r\nhighlights the United Nations system-wide follow-up to\r\nthe Summit in this regard. We believe that the United\r\nNations must focus on inter-agency cooperation to address\r\nthe issues in a focused manner, avoid duplication and\r\nincrease the allocation of resources for country level and\r\nregional level follow-up and implementation. All relevant\r\norganizations of the United Nations system should also\r\nprioritize their respective programmes with the objective\r\nof the speedy implementation of the outcome.\r\nFourthly, the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund must prioritize social development and\r\nallocate substantial resources for this purpose. If the\r\nsocial sectors are neglected, the result will be social strife\r\nand unrest, which may result in more instability.\r\nFifthly, the participation of civil society as partners\r\nof Governments will significantly contribute to the\r\nimplementation of the commitments made at Copenhagen.\r\nThe grass-roots approach of civil society will complement\r\nthe Government’s role of policy-setting, coordination and\r\noverall supervision of the implementation process. A\r\nstrong and accountable civil society can greatly help\r\nreduce poverty, create employment and increase social\r\ncohesion.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the preparations for the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development and further initiatives in the year 2000.\r\nWe also thank the Government of Switzerland for its offer\r\nto hold the special session in the year 2000 in Geneva.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French): My\r\ndelegation wishes to associate itself fully with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nAs I emphasized yesterday in the Third Committee,\r\nthe question of social development is one of the major\r\nissues facing humanity in the last years of this century. It\r\nwill be one of the vital priorities of the international\r\ncommunity at the beginning of the twenty-first century,\r\nprecisely because social issues are people, and people are\r\nat the beginning and at the end of any concept of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development, held in\r\nCopenhagen in March 1995, rallied a broad consensus\r\naround the essential need to refocus national priorities and\r\nthe agenda of our Organization on questions of human\r\ndevelopment. The Copenhagen Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action on Social Development adopted at the Summit\r\nremain today our common reference points for elaborating\r\nand implementing social policies. Given their relevance and\r\ntheir timeliness, made even more obvious today by the\r\nfinancial crisis in Asia and its unexpected repercussions in\r\nother parts of the world, Senegal does not believe that they\r\nneed to be renegotiated.\r\nAs the Preparatory Committee for the special session\r\nin the year 2000 recommends, we need to reaffirm the\r\nCopenhagen consensus, critically to assess its\r\nimplementation and adopt concrete and pragmatic\r\nrecommendations conducive to the effective and\r\ncoordinated implementation of the 10 commitments\r\nundertaken by our Governments.\r\nMy delegation is pleased by the high quality of the\r\nreports submitted to us on the preparation for the special\r\nsession in the year 2000 on follow-up to Copenhagen. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report on the follow-up to the\r\nCopenhagen Summit and the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee convinced me that the United Nations is\r\ndetermined to do everything to assure that Copenhagen +5\r\ndoes not become a replay of the Summit, but that it should\r\nserve as a spearhead for giving new impetus to the process\r\nalready under way to effectively implement the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation welcomes the offer\r\nmade by the Government of Switzerland to host the\r\nspecial session in the year 2000 at Geneva. My country\r\nenjoys excellent relations with the Government of\r\nSwitzerland and is convinced that that friendly country\r\nwill do its all to ensure that the special session convenes\r\nin the best possible conditions.\r\nThe social crisis that arose in the early 1990s, and\r\nthe anxiety and sense of impotence it provoked, made it\r\nnecessary for the States Members of the United Nations\r\nto convene the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nDespite the scope of measures adopted three years ago, it\r\nhas become clear today that poverty, far from\r\ndiminishing, has increased in certain countries or regions\r\nof the world, in the South and the North alike. Social\r\nconflicts have not ebbed. Social insecurity, fear for the\r\nfuture and the shortage or absence of jobs, particularly for\r\nthe young, remain major concerns for all our countries.\r\nThe gap is widening between rich and poor countries and,\r\nwithin the wealthy countries, between rich and poor\r\ncitizens. The solution to social problems is beyond the\r\nmeans and measures of any single Government alone.\r\nOfficial development assistance is plummeting from year\r\nto year. The goal of integrating women and the elderly as\r\nfull members of society remains unattained. The\r\nvulnerability of children and the failure to take into\r\naccount their rights, as enshrined in the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child, remains a serious challenge to the\r\nentire international community.\r\nThe picture I have just painted is reflected in various\r\ndocuments of the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nCommission for Social Development and in other studies\r\nconducted by United Nations agencies. The picture is\r\nhardly pretty, especially since, in some regions of the\r\nworld, particularly in Africa, civil wars and other inter-\r\nState conflicts are creating tens of thousands, even tens of\r\nmillions, of newly marginalized people.\r\nThe Human Development Report 1998 states that\r\nmore than a billion people are unable to meet their basic\r\nconsumption needs, that 60 per cent of the 4.5 billion\r\ninhabitants of the developing countries are without basic\r\nhealth facilities and that almost a third of these have no\r\naccess to drinking water.\r\nHumanity only raises problems that it can resolve\r\nand I have no doubt that it does have the resources\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nnecessary to defeat malnutrition and hunger, to guarantee a\r\ndecent life to every man and woman, and to build a\r\nbalanced society of mutual assistance and solidarity. The\r\ninternational community has the means to do this. It has the\r\nability to do this. It must have the generosity to do this.\r\nEven if the primary responsibility for implementing\r\nthe outcome of Copenhagen falls first to each Government,\r\nit is highly important that the United Nations, through its\r\nsystem, and other development partners strengthen their\r\nassistance to poor countries. I know that the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, like the World Bank, is currently\r\nseeking to refocus its activities on poverty eradication,\r\nwhile taking into account other important programming\r\nsectors, such as gender parity, productive employment,\r\ngood governance, sustainable development and the\r\nconservation and improvement of the environment.\r\nOther funds, programmes and agencies, as well as\r\nnumerous non-governmental organizations, are also striving,\r\nin their respective fields of competence, to implement the\r\noutcome of Copenhagen by reorienting and refocusing their\r\nactivities on questions of vulnerability, social integration\r\nand poverty eradication.\r\nIt is therefore important, in this dynamic context, that\r\nemphasis be placed on national and local capacity-building,\r\npromoting productive employment and lowering\r\nunemployment, promoting a micro-credit system, and\r\nimproving access to basic social services for all. In a word,\r\ngreater priority must be placed on promoting social\r\ninvestments and the social dimension of adjustment and\r\neconomic, monetary and financial restructuring\r\nprogrammes.\r\nMy country, Senegal, which enjoys excellent\r\ncooperation with the United Nations system, has drafted, in\r\ncooperation with its development partners, a national\r\npoverty eradication programme. We are trying to implement\r\nit with our own budgetary resources and those provided by\r\nfriendly countries and international institutions. The\r\nstrategic guidelines of Senegal’s ninth national plan for\r\neconomic and social development gives priority national\r\ninterest to poverty eradication. Poverty and its eradication\r\nremain major challenges that must be met during the first\r\nUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty.\r\nTo that end, we must develop an integrated and\r\ninnovative holistic approach that takes into due account the\r\nrole of values in formulating national social policy.\r\nUltimately, we must develop and implement a political\r\nculture of social progress, peace and democracy.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to express the\r\nhope that the special session to be held in the year 2000\r\nwill help us to attain this noble goal, which we all share.\r\nMr. Al-Humaimidi (Iraq) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): Allow me at the outset to join those who\r\nsupported the statement made by the representative of\r\nIndonesia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nIraq has always been keen on participating in the\r\ndeliberations under this agenda item for many reasons.\r\nFirst and foremost, this item is of particular interest and\r\nimportance to developing countries because it relates to\r\nan important part of the process of comprehensive\r\ndevelopment. Furthermore, Iraq faces a critical situation\r\nbrought about by the harsh circumstances resulting from\r\nthe economic sanctions which have been in effect for over\r\neight years. Because of this, the development process in\r\nIraq has faced many burdens. This is because Iraq must\r\nrespond to the traditional tasks required by the\r\ndevelopment process in any developing country, while at\r\nthe same time devising plans to alleviate the destructive\r\neffects of the sanctions in all areas of life.\r\nAt its fifty-second session the General Assembly\r\naffirmed the need for renewed political will on the\r\nnational, regional and international levels to realize the\r\ngoals of social development. Governments were urged to\r\nput in place or promote comprehensive strategies to\r\nimplement the outcome of the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. In this respect, we must emphasize some\r\nimportant facts. Realization of development requires the\r\nprovision of two critical and basic elements, as well as\r\nthe political will of the State and its genuine desire to\r\nrealize development. These factors are financial resources\r\nand international cooperation. Because of the acts of\r\naggression committed against Iraq on 17 September 1991\r\nand because of the continued economic embargo against\r\nit, Iraq has been deprived of financial resources. On the\r\nother hand, the sanctions have created basic obstacles at\r\nthe level of international economic and developmental\r\ncooperation. Thus, Iraq has been deprived of all basic\r\nfactors needed for any development, irrespective of shape\r\nor size.\r\nUndoubtedly the rights to health and education are\r\nthe cornerstones of social development. Without\r\npreserving and developing these cornerstones, no country\r\ncan claim to have taken important steps on the road of\r\nsocial development. In this context, I wish to address\r\nsome facts concerning the health and economic situation\r\nin Iraq. The ongoing embargo has led to a deterioration\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nin health services in terms of prevention and treatment,\r\nparticularly with regard to programmes of primary medical\r\ncare, nutrition, maternity, prenatal care, combating disease,\r\nenvironmental health, family care and planning, social\r\npsychological care and special programmes for the disabled.\r\nIn the area of family planning, the reproductive health\r\nproject was adversely affected by the failure to date to\r\nprovide the special equipment needed and provided for by\r\nthe International Family Planning Federation to the Iraqi\r\nSociety for Family Planning of 1997.\r\nIt has been impossible to provide more than 18 per\r\ncent of the services needed by the target audience,\r\nrepresenting the sector which is most in need of services in\r\nthe field of family planning and reproductive health. In\r\naddition, there has been a sharp decline in the level of\r\nservices because of the near total destruction of clean water\r\nsystems and pumping stations in the war. What remained\r\nwas eventually destroyed because of the embargo, due to\r\nthe lack of spare parts needed to maintain those stations\r\nand the scarcity of chlorine and other purifiers.\r\nAs regards education, this sector has also deteriorated\r\nbecause of the shortage in the most rudimentary\r\nrequirements for education. There is a shortage of pencils\r\nused by students in their studies. There is a shortage of\r\nover 650,000 desks because there are no raw materials to\r\nmake them. We have also have shortages in schoolbooks,\r\nof which 40 million are needed. More than 9,000 schools\r\nrequire restoration or maintenance. Other needs are also\r\ndifficult to provide, like writing boards, chalk and\r\nnotebooks. Due to the ongoing embargo, the expansion plan\r\nfor school construction, which included building 3,973 new\r\nschools between 1990 and 1996, came to a complete halt.\r\nAll of this has led to a widespread drop-out rate and to\r\nother behaviour problems. More than 500,000 students have\r\ndropped out of schools since 1995. The number of those\r\nwho have deserted the education workforce has reached\r\n12,373.\r\nBecause of the ongoing embargo there are also new\r\nchallenges that women must face, the most important of\r\nwhich is having to provide for their families and catering to\r\ntheir needs by doing marginal non-productive work. That\r\nhas adversely affected women’s productive social activities\r\noutside the home and has led to a deterioration in their\r\nsocietal role.\r\nThese are some of the symptoms that prevent the\r\nrealization of social development in Iraq. It should be\r\nmentioned here that resolution 52/136 reaffirmed the\r\nimportance of the right to development as an integral part\r\nof fundamental human rights for every human person and\r\nfor all peoples in all countries, particularly the developing\r\ncountries. The resolution calls on all Member States to\r\nmake further concrete efforts at the national and\r\ninternational levels to eliminate all obstacles to the\r\nrealization of the right to development.\r\nAccordingly, the international community, which\r\ntook upon itself a commitment under the Copenhagen\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action to promote a world\r\nenvironment favourable to realizing social development,\r\nis duty-bound to address the destructive direct or indirect\r\neffects of sanctions on the economic and social\r\ninfrastructures of targeted countries, where the first victim\r\nis the development process, particularly as we are about\r\nto evaluate the achievements and follow up the results of\r\nthe Copenhagen Summit. The first step towards the\r\nrealization of social development in Iraq must be the\r\nlifting of the economic sanctions that have no legal,\r\nhumanitarian or ethical justification whatsoever,\r\nparticularly since Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations\r\nunder the Security Council resolutions. This will enable\r\nIraq to provide the necessary elements that will lead to\r\naccelerated and comprehensive social development. Iraq\r\nwill then be able to compensate for the destructive effects\r\nof the embargo.\r\nMr. Samhan Al-Nuaimi (United Arab Emirates)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): I have the pleasure, on\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates, to\r\njoin those who have spoken before me in addressing my\r\nthanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General. Indeed,\r\nhis report on the follow-up to the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development held in Copenhagen in 1995 is\r\nreplete with invaluable signposts which provide a useful\r\nframework for our deliberations. I would also like to\r\nexpress my support for the statements on these issues\r\nmade by the representative of Indonesia on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nThe Social Summit marked a milestone in\r\nrelationships of international cooperation for development,\r\noffering the world an overall vision of the\r\nmultidimensional nature of world social development on\r\nthe eve of the twenty-first century. Notwithstanding the\r\ncommitments made by heads of State or Government that\r\nfound their way into the Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction adopted in Copenhagen, which included a priority\r\nlist of actions to be taken collectively by the international\r\ncommunity to ensure social integration, prosperity and\r\nhappiness, the efforts exerted up to now at national,\r\nregional and international levels through the Economic\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nand Social Council and various international programmes,\r\nas well as through the Commission for Social Development\r\nto ensure proper follow-up on these priorities, have not yet\r\nachieved the qualitative shift desired for the improvement\r\nin the social situation of the world today. The world\r\nsituation today has resulted from the widening economic,\r\nsocial and cultural gap between developed and developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe advantages of globalization and liberalization of\r\neconomies which have marked international relations in\r\nrecent years are still beyond attainment for most peoples of\r\ndeveloping countries. This is due to their growing exposure\r\nto the problems of malnutrition, disease, unemployment,\r\nserious ecological crises, the external debt burden, violence,\r\ndrug abuse, discrimination and injustice, as well as the\r\nmany other challenges of deep poverty which afflict the 1.3\r\nbillion people who lack the simplest and most elementary\r\nsocial services, such as basic food supplies, drinking water,\r\nhousing, safety, health, education, security and the like.\r\nThe delegation of the United Arab Emirates has fully\r\nsupported follow-through on the Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action adopted in Copenhagen, which, as we\r\nsee it, reflects a pragmatic approach needed to ensure\r\nincreased worldwide awareness of the nature of these social\r\nproblems at present. My delegation feels, accordingly, that\r\nan across-the-board implementation of this programme\r\nrequires us to take a determined approach in international\r\nand regional cooperative relations in order to adopt better\r\npolicies for social development based upon concepts of\r\ngenuine partnership and of burden-sharing within their\r\nlarger scopes. Thus will we be able to expand development\r\naid for developing countries and arrangements for the\r\nexchange of scientific and technological experiences, and\r\nfor trade and investment, either through bilateral or\r\nmultilateral channels. This will contribute to enabling the\r\ndeveloping countries to improve their ability to deal\r\nsuccessfully with the globalization of development. In this\r\ncontext, we should also call for joining our efforts to create\r\nthe appropriate machinery to address our shared concerns\r\nrelating to the family, children, women, the aged, the\r\nhandicapped, the provision of proper educational and health\r\nservices and the like.\r\nIt is our feeling that the armed conflicts afflicting\r\nmany different parts of the world are serious challenges to\r\nsocial development. Indeed, they are a major source of the\r\nproliferation of many other complex transnational problems,\r\nsuch as organized crime, illegal trafficking in arms and\r\nnarcotic drugs, money-laundering and the like. We therefore\r\nsupport the recommendations of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment designed to strengthen international\r\npartnership in order to meet these challenges. This would\r\nbe accomplished through finding alternative ways to\r\ndevelopment, developing human resources and a\r\nproductive workforce, reducing unemployment and\r\nimproving the quality of social services for all sectors of\r\nsocieties, on the basis of sustainability and justice.\r\nWe look forward to the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the year 2000 to take stock of the\r\nachievements in following through on Copenhagen. In this\r\nconnection, we stress the need and importance of\r\nstrengthening the role played by the United Nations and\r\nits specialized agencies in dealing more effectively with\r\nthese areas, especially the humanitarian, economic and\r\nsocial arenas.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates participated actively in\r\nthe World Summit in Copenhagen and, in response to the\r\nrecommendations of that important conference, has been\r\nkeen on strengthening our national development strategies\r\nand updating some of our legislation and developmental\r\nand social activities. All this is in keeping with our\r\naspirations to develop our human resources and to ensure\r\na decent living standard for the individual as a maker and\r\nbeneficiary of development. In this respect, His Highness\r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, head of State of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, has expressed our determination to\r\nimprove health services, training and education and to\r\nimplement programmes for social interdependence to help\r\nthe handicapped, orphans and the aged and to ensure that\r\nthey are better integrated into the mainstream of society.\r\nThese programmes will also improve their participation in\r\nbuilding society, while strengthening the concepts of\r\nfamily and societal unity and cohesion, taking account of\r\nthe particularities of our own customs and the traditions\r\nof our heritage and the teachings of Islam.\r\nBy the same token, our Government has made a\r\npoint of giving women a unique place in the realm of\r\nnational development, because they are the pillars of our\r\nsociety. We have also sought to strengthen grass-roots\r\nand community-based partnership, especially between\r\npublic interest and private sector organizations, in the\r\nimplementation of many policies and national\r\nprogrammes. This is in addition to the provision of job\r\nopportunities on an equitable basis to men and women\r\nalike. We are pursuing implementation of our plans to\r\ndevelop remote rural areas and link them to urban areas\r\nby providing them with electric power, water, adequate\r\nhousing and the like across our country.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nWe are also working hand in hand with bilateral,\r\nregional and international partners in development. Thus,\r\nwe have contributed to financing many socio-economic\r\ndevelopment projects in a number of other developing\r\ncountries, granting some of them concessionary loans to\r\nenable them, in turn, to meet their own needs for basic\r\nsocial services. We have also hosted a number of\r\ninternational colloquiums, seminars, conferences and\r\ntraining workshops designed to deal with social,\r\nenvironmental, housing and other developmental issues.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that social development is a\r\nfirm commitment which has been affirmed by various\r\ncovenants and agreements, foremost among which is the\r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural\r\nRights. We must take concerted action to realize the\r\naspirations expressed in the Programme of Action of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen,\r\nwhich are designed to bring about justice and to improve\r\nthe lot of many millions of people throughout the world.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Croatia): As this is the first time that\r\nI have had the honour of addressing the General Assembly\r\nat this session, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress my congratulations to Minister Didier Opertti upon\r\nhis election. I am confident that he will very successfully\r\nguide the deliberations of the Assembly.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development, held in\r\nCopenhagen in 1995, was the first major United Nations\r\nconference specifically on social development issues. The\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action adopted\r\nat the Summit represent a new consensus on the need to put\r\npeople at the centre of development. It was the largest ever\r\ngathering of world leaders with the common goal of\r\naddressing social issues, fighting poverty, creating\r\nproductive jobs and making a stable, safe and just society.\r\nThe presence of 117 heads of State or Government gave\r\nimmense political weight to the final conclusions.\r\nThe Summit’s goals of eliminating inequality within\r\nand among States were designed to create stability and\r\nsecurity in the world, which would lead to lasting peace. In\r\nthis noble endeavour it is necessary to focus not only on\r\nsocial and economic development but on the full spectrum\r\nof development, which includes full respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nIn this light, it should be noted that social\r\ndevelopment requires an integrated approach and involves\r\nimplementation of the conclusions of all the global\r\nconferences — those of Rio, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen,\r\nBeijing and Istanbul.\r\nAt this juncture, almost four years after the holding\r\nof the Social Summit, we need to seriously evaluate\r\nwhether enough has been done to implement the\r\ncommitments made at the Summit, as well as to explore\r\nways to proceed further in order to accomplish the goals\r\nset at Copenhagen.\r\nSocial problems are still spread across the entire\r\nworld, and it is obvious that they cannot be the exclusive\r\nresponsibility of national Governments. Rather, they\r\nrequire global attention and action. Not even the most\r\ndeveloped States are immune to the problems of social\r\ndevelopment, poverty, unemployment and social\r\ndisintegration. Some countries can cope with those\r\nproblems on their own, but most need the assistance and\r\ncooperation of the international community.\r\nUnfortunately, while there have been some national\r\nand collective efforts, including those of the United\r\nNations system, to fulfil the commitments made in\r\nCopenhagen, much remains to be done. As stated in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General,\r\n“it is clear that far more extensive and effective\r\naction is required at the international, regional and\r\nnational levels to tackle the desperately serious\r\nproblems of poverty, unemployment and social\r\ndisintegration faced by most countries“. (A/53/211,\r\npara. 78)\r\nLet me reiterate that it states “by most countries”.\r\nPoverty, instead of being reduced, has actually\r\nincreased since the holding of the Summit. In addition,\r\nonly a handful of countries have achieved or surpassed\r\nthe target of applying 0.7 per cent of their gross national\r\nproduct for official development assistance, as called for\r\nin Copenhagen.\r\nAlthough we are well aware that it is the least\r\ndeveloped countries which need the greatest assistance for\r\nsocial development, countries with economies in transition\r\nalso require international cooperation. The changes in the\r\neconomic system in these countries affected all other\r\naspects of social development and increased\r\nunemployment and poverty among certain segments of\r\nsociety. We wish to stress that dissatisfaction and\r\nfrustration in these countries could eventually exact a\r\nmuch higher price from the international community than\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nthe amount of temporary assistance now needed to put\r\neconomic and social development in those countries on the\r\nright track.\r\nFrom the point of view of the flow of international\r\nassistance, the Republic of Croatia, as a Central European\r\nand Mediterranean country, should belong to the category\r\nof donor States. However, the costs and consequences not\r\nonly of transition but also of the war of aggression which\r\nwas conducted against it were such that Croatia is still not\r\nin a position to assume that role.\r\nOn the national level, the Republic of Croatia has\r\nundertaken numerous measures designed to implement the\r\ncommitments of the Social Summit. Croatia has instituted\r\na National Employment Policy, which consists of various\r\nmeasures designed to decrease unemployment and\r\nunderemployment, decrease labour costs, increase labour\r\nmobility and improve cooperation between the Government,\r\nemployers and the unions in creating jobs.\r\nThe policy includes activities by the National\r\nEmployment Agency, in cooperation with employers, to\r\norganize training programmes for the unemployed in line\r\nwith the needs of, and changes in, the labour market.\r\nAttention is being paid to the needs of specific groups, such\r\nas the young and long-term unemployed. In keeping with\r\nthe Summit’s goal of equalizing opportunities for people\r\nwith disabilities, the National Employment Agency has\r\nspecial programmes for the disabled. The policy also\r\nincludes measures to stimulate self-employment by\r\nproviding credit, organizing seminars on establishing a\r\nbusiness and providing analysis of the lines of business\r\nwhich provide the best opportunities for self-employment in\r\nvarious localities.\r\nIn keeping with the Social Summit’s commitment to\r\nequality for women, the Croatian Government has\r\nestablished the National Policy for the Promotion of\r\nEquality. As part of this policy, measures have been\r\nestablished which are to be undertaken by the year 2000 by\r\nGovernment bodies, in cooperation with non-governmental\r\norganizations, for the purpose of improving the economic\r\nposition of women and their greater participation at all\r\nlevels of political life. This also constitutes implementation\r\nof the Beijing Platform for Action.\r\nThe Croatian Government has also established the\r\nNational Programme of Action for Children. The eventual\r\ngoals of this programme are to guarantee free and healthy\r\nfood for children under three years old in pre-school\r\nprogrammes, to eliminate taxes for children’s clothing and\r\nfood and to ensure adequate living conditions for all\r\nfamilies. In the field of health, the programme is designed\r\nto provide free health care for children and special\r\ndepartments and services for child rehabilitation,\r\nespecially for those children with developmental\r\nproblems. In addition, health guidance clinics for children\r\nare to be established, and the Government will actively\r\npromote the healthy upbringing of children and young\r\npeople.\r\nThe National Programme of Action for Children, in\r\nconjunction with the National Employment Policy and\r\nspecial measures for the advancement, upbringing,\r\neducation and social security of children, is designed to\r\nhelp eliminate poverty, one of the major aims of the\r\nSummit.\r\nIn meeting its commitments made at Copenhagen, as\r\nwell as facilitating its social development, Croatia will be\r\ngreatly assisted by the scheduled pledging conference for\r\ndevelopment and reconstruction, which the international\r\ncommunity is planning to conduct in Croatia.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to stress that increasing global\r\ninterdependence requires increased international solidarity\r\nto fulfil the commitments of the Social Summit to\r\neradicate poverty, provide productive employment and\r\npromote social integration.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of the Philippines.\r\nMrs. Lacanlale (Philippines): When our leaders\r\ncrafted the landmark document on social development in\r\nMarch 1995 at the Copenhagen Summit, they already\r\nenvisioned a review mechanism to ensure full\r\nimplementation of commitments. Thus, General Assembly\r\nresolution 50/161 of 22 December 1995 simply mirrored\r\nthat sentiment when it decided to hold a special session\r\nin the year 2000 for an overall review and appraisal of\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development. And our Heads of States or\r\nGovernments expect no less than the plenary of the\r\nAssembly to take full charge in ensuring adequate\r\npreparations for a successful review session in the year\r\n2000.\r\nMy delegation is fully satisfied with the preparations\r\nundertaken thus far. The Assembly has laid out clearly in\r\nits resolutions 51/202 and 52/25 the principal\r\nconsiderations that should guide the preparatory process\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nand the special session of the General Assembly in the year\r\n2000.\r\nWe fully agree that the mandated role of the\r\nCommission for Social Development should remain intact\r\nand that, as a functional Commission of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, it has the primary responsibility for the\r\nfollow-up to the Summit and review of the implementation\r\nof the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action.\r\nWe are gratified to note that the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment has indeed discharged its mandate accordingly\r\nand that a practical link has been established through the\r\ndesignation of its Chairman as ex officio in the Bureau of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee.\r\nMy delegation expects that on the basis of various\r\ninputs, particularly from the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment, the Preparatory Committee could then initiate\r\nits substantive activities in 1999. In this regard, it is critical\r\nto ensure that agreed conclusions of the Commission,\r\nparticularly on the priority themes for 1998 on promoting\r\nsocial integration and participation of all people, including\r\nthe disadvantaged and vulnerable groups and persons, and\r\non the priority themes for 1999 on social services for all,\r\nfind concrete expression in enriching the preparatory\r\nprocess for the special session.\r\nIt is equally important that the international\r\ncommunity continue to address the two other core issues on\r\npoverty and unemployment to ensure that the pertinent\r\ncommitments made at the Copenhagen Summit are fulfilled\r\nand that countries are indeed serious in meeting their\r\nrespective obligations under the Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action.\r\nThe preparatory process should, at the same time, seek\r\nmore opportunities that can bring about the implementation\r\nof commitments made at Copenhagen. It must not be\r\nlimited to activities or meetings which are, by themselves,\r\npart and parcel of the preparatory process. Supportive\r\nmeetings and other related activities must be organized to\r\nraise awareness for the immediate implementation of\r\ncommitments made at Copenhagen. Such support activities\r\ncould highlight the role of the United Nations system and\r\nthe participation of non-governmental organizations, as well\r\nas civil society. Relevant national or regional activities\r\ncould also be arranged and coordinated to ensure maximum\r\npolitical momentum for the implementation of the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action. The\r\nSecretariat should be able to provide the required assistance\r\nfor the arrangement and coordination of such activities.\r\nIt is clear to us that the principal objective of the\r\nspecial session is to reaffirm and not to renegotiate the\r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action. The\r\nspecial session can then review the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration and the Programme of Action and recommend\r\nfurther concrete actions and initiatives that will contribute\r\nto a full and effective implementation of commitments.\r\nThis Assembly must confirm such an understanding lest\r\nwe put the preparatory process and the special session in\r\ndisarray. The decisions adopted by the Preparatory\r\nCommittee at its organizational meeting in May this year\r\nwere very explicit in this regard.\r\nIt is very important that Member countries accord\r\nthe fullest support to the work of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee to ensure adequate preparation for the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly. This means that\r\nMember States should be actively involved in the\r\nCommission for Social Development, since this is the\r\nbody that will carry most of the burden in initiating\r\nsubstantive inputs for the Preparatory Committee. The\r\nCommission has been entrusted with the responsibility of\r\nacting as the forum for national reporting and for\r\nidentifying areas where further initiatives are needed for\r\nconsideration by the Preparatory Committee.\r\nWe also expect the Commission to have the first\r\nopportunity to examine the various inputs requested from\r\nthe Secretary-General in the decisions adopted by the\r\nPreparatory Committee at its organizational session. I\r\nrefer to the general guidelines, structure and common\r\nframework for national reporting which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral was requested to formulate. I also refer to a\r\nreport focusing on the implementation of the 10\r\ncommitments, including the three core issues, at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels, which will be\r\nmade available to the first substantive session of the\r\nPreparatory Committee from 17 to 28 May 1999. The\r\nthirty-seventh session of the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment in February 1999 must have every\r\nopportunity to examine such reports so that appropriate\r\ninputs are subsequently provided to the Preparatory\r\nCommittee.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the requested reports are\r\ncompleted in due time and that delegations are given an\r\nopportunity to examine them so that effective\r\ncontributions are made to the work of the Commission for\r\nSocial Development and, subsequently, to the Preparatory\r\nCommittee.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nIt is obvious that far more extensive and effective\r\naction is required at the international, regional, and national\r\nlevels to confront the serious problems of poverty,\r\nunemployment and social disintegration. It is also clear that\r\ncountries must do more to be faithful to what they have\r\ncommitted themselves to at Copenhagen.\r\nThe developing countries have done the best they\r\ncould under trying conditions — underdevelopment, the\r\ndebilitating burden of external indebtedness and other\r\nserious setbacks to their economies. My country is doing its\r\npart. The Philippine Government has consolidated and\r\nfocused its poverty alleviation efforts into a social reform\r\nagenda. Among its key thrusts are convergence and focus\r\nin the delivery of social services, asset reform and\r\nsustainable development of productive resources, institution\r\nbuilding and participatory governance. To guide our focus,\r\nwe are employing a 33-point minimum basic needs\r\nindicator system. This comprehensive survey has so far\r\nbeen put in place in all of our 77 provinces, in almost two\r\nthirds of our 1,539 municipalities, and more than a third of\r\nour 41,000 villages or barangays.\r\nWe intend to persist in our efforts despite the\r\naggravating circumstances that have been brought about by\r\nthe financial turbulence in our region. We also expect the\r\ninternational community to manifest its solidarity with us\r\nthrough concrete steps, including those that are directly\r\nresponsive to the commitments made at Copenhagen.\r\nWe see the preparatory process and the special session\r\nitself as a validation of the required courses of action\r\nagreed upon at the Social Summit. We see it as a\r\nrecommitment to a global vision of sustained and broad-\r\nbased developments, where equity and justice prevail\r\nworldwide.\r\nAnd in the midst of the current economic difficulties\r\nin our part of the world, we appeal to the international\r\ncommunity that now is the time to redouble our efforts to\r\nfully implement the Copenhagen Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nSudan.\r\nMr. Ahmed (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nwish at the outset to express our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his effort in preparing the report, contained in\r\ndocument A/53/211 of 6 August 1998, on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development. My delegation also wants to associate\r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of\r\nIndonesia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, in\r\nwhich he stressed the importance of promoting both\r\nNorth-South and South-South cooperation to foster social\r\ndevelopment. Everyone has praised United Nations efforts\r\nin this sphere.\r\nBy giving special attention to the social dimension\r\nof development, we are affirming the human aspect of\r\ndevelopment. In the past, efforts were concentrated on the\r\neconomic aspects of development. We are happy to recall\r\nthe sponsorship by the United Nations in the 1980s of a\r\nsuccessful meeting at Khartoum on the human aspects of\r\ndevelopment. Efforts then continued, culminating in\r\nCopenhagen in March 1995 with the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development.\r\nIn studying the report of the Secretary-General, we\r\ntook particular note of part IV, entitled “Priority theme\r\nfor 1998: promoting social integration and participation of\r\nall people, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups\r\nand persons: thirty-sixth session of the Commission for\r\nSocial Development”. This theme, which includes the\r\nconcept of the provision of social services for all, is\r\ndiscussed in paragraphs 16 to 19 of the report.\r\nIn this connection, my country, the Republic of\r\nSudan, has entered upon a pioneering experience in the\r\narea of social integration by creating a number of social\r\ndefence funds to help the poor and to provide them with\r\nresources enabling them to work in professions and in\r\nlight industry, while covering their medical expenses. We\r\nhave also created financial assistance funds for university\r\nstudents to help them afford accommodation and meet\r\nother basic needs. In addition, we have set up projects\r\nduring the academic vacations under the theme of “A\r\nproductive student”.\r\nIn connection with student aid, we want to highlight\r\nour Government’s efforts to broaden the educational base\r\nof our people, out of our belief in the principle of\r\neducation for all. In this context, our Government has\r\nestablished 23 universities throughout Sudan, where there\r\nwere only 5 before it came to power.\r\nAs part of the Government’s efforts to ensure social\r\nintegration, public and private institutions have developed\r\nthe idea of holding collective marriage ceremonies to help\r\nmen and women meet their marriage costs. This\r\nrepresents a contribution towards their stability, and a\r\nreinforcement of the family stability that is encouraged by\r\nthe precepts of Islam, which is the cornerstone of our\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nsociety. I particularly remember a collective marriage\r\nceremony organized by a government agency for a group of\r\ndisabled people, a ceremony which left its impact on the\r\nmembers of that group, by making them part of the fabric\r\nof an integrated society.\r\nWe all believe that people are the basic focus and the\r\npurpose of development; they are also the means to that\r\ndevelopment. People live in different environments and\r\ndifferent cultures. Thus, it has become difficult to impose\r\na single development model on all societies. For that\r\nreason, my delegation believes that we must reflect the\r\ncultural, social and religious diversity of all countries as we\r\nstrive to attain realistic and objective social development,\r\nwithout imposing a single model on everyone. In the light\r\nof that conviction, we call upon all members of the\r\ninternational community to work together to realize that\r\nprinciple of social development, which we have sought for\r\nso long through North-South and South-South participation\r\nand partnership.\r\nWe are making enormous efforts to further social and\r\neconomic development in the face of foreign pressures. The\r\nrecent aggression by the United States against a\r\npharmaceuticals factory in my country is but the latest\r\nexample. We also face domestic problems such as a civil\r\nwar, which was imposed upon southern Sudan and which\r\ncaused an exodus by hundreds of thousands of people from\r\nthe south to the north. This placed a heavy burden on our\r\neconomic resources and our social services. Despite all\r\nthese factors, my Government has made valuable efforts in\r\nthis regard, which have won commendation from the United\r\nNations and other organizations.\r\nSomething else that affects our economic and social\r\ndevelopment is the influx of thousands of refugees from\r\nneighbouring countries. As it faces that burden, my country\r\nhas decided to hold, in cooperation with the Organization\r\nof African Unity, a meeting of Foreign Ministers of African\r\ncountries in December at Khartoum, to consider and seek\r\nto resolve problems related to refugees and displaced\r\npersons, in order to create an environment in which all\r\nAfrican countries can enjoy economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe wish in conclusion to reaffirm our support for the\r\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly on\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit. Like other speakers, we are of the view that the\r\nsession should reaffirm the conclusions of the Copenhagen\r\nSummit, and should not reopen debate on matters already\r\nagreed upon. We believe that all parties, especially donor\r\ncountries, should demonstrate the political will to honour\r\nexisting commitments.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with the\r\ndecision taken by the General Assembly at its 30th\r\nplenary meeting, held on 6 October 1998, I now call on\r\nthe Observer of Switzerland.\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland): The current economic\r\nand financial crises affecting a large part of the world\r\nhave made the implications of globalization and\r\ninterdependence clear: no longer is it possible to remain\r\nan island of prosperity when the rest of the world suffers\r\nfrom a serious economic crisis; poverty anywhere\r\nconstitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere.\r\nIn situations of economic turmoil, there is always the\r\ndanger that the previously praised and obvious benefits of\r\nthe open economy will be forgotten. Yet a resulting\r\ngeneral swing back of the pendulum of economic policy\r\nmust be prevented. A strategy relying on two pillars,\r\nlinking social and economic policies, should achieve that\r\npurpose.\r\nOn one hand, protectionism — above all in\r\ndeveloped countries — has to be prevented and the\r\npursuit of sound macroeconomic policies has to be\r\nactively supported. On the other hand, the potential gains\r\nof an open economy have to be more widely spread\r\namong and within societies. Within this framework, a key\r\ntool will be the creation of freely chosen and\r\nremunerative employment in both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries and the improvement of socio-\r\neconomic conditions as specified by the recently adopted\r\nInternational Labour Organization Declaration on\r\nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work, which also\r\ncalls for new and focused assistance for developing\r\ncountries.\r\nInnovative solutions and approaches are required to\r\nimplement such a strategy, and the Swiss Government can\r\nfully subscribe to the forward-looking approach the\r\nSecretariat has emphasized in its preparatory work.\r\nFurther steps should be taken, however — for example,\r\nbetter coordination and cooperation within the United\r\nNations family and other international organizations to\r\nimprove the impact of our actions, which has to be\r\ncritically reinforced by reaching out to new important\r\nplayers.\r\nYesterday and today many speakers have suggested\r\nnumerous interesting approaches, many of which are\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nsupported by the Swiss Government. The discussion of\r\nthese proposals should be initiated at the earliest possible\r\nstage. However, permit me to focus today more particularly\r\non a specific Swiss contribution which, hopefully, will\r\npromote fruitful deliberations.\r\nDuring the meetings of the Preparatory Committee\r\nheld in May 1998, Switzerland invited the United Nations\r\nto hold its General Assembly special session from 26 to 30\r\nJune in the year 2000 at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.\r\nThis date conveniently follows the annual International\r\nLabour Conference, which will also be held at the Palais\r\ndes Nations in Geneva in June 2000. Other advantages of\r\nchoosing the Geneva location were presented in document\r\nA/AC.253/4. The following comments are therefore limited\r\nto particular parts of our offer.\r\nFirst, Switzerland will assume all additional costs that\r\nthe United Nations would have incurred. As a result,\r\nholding the follow-up conference in Geneva will have no\r\nprogramme budget implications for the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, through voluntary contributions Switzerland\r\nwill promote the best possible conditions for the\r\nparticipants of the conference. For example, to facilitate the\r\nparticipation of least developed countries, the Swiss\r\nGovernment will match the United Nations contribution for\r\na General Assembly special session and provide an\r\nadditional airline ticket to Geneva for each least developed\r\ncountry. For countries with no representation in Geneva,\r\nthere will be fully equipped office space. Furthermore, we\r\nare currently negotiating for the best possible participant\r\nconditions with various local service providers. For\r\nexample, government representatives will benefit from\r\nspecial conference rates for accommodation.\r\nAs mentioned in the Secretary-General’s note, the\r\nSwiss Government has announced its willingness to provide\r\nfurther assistance based on an assessment of individual\r\nneeds. To ensure the continuity of the work between the\r\npreparatory process in New York and the follow-up\r\nconference in Geneva, we offer to provide assistance for\r\ntravel between the two cities for countries belonging to the\r\nGroup of 77 with particular economic difficulties.\r\nAs stated in the relevant document of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee, a definitive decision regarding the place and\r\ndate of the session has to be taken by the end of this part\r\nof the General Assembly session, in 1998. We very much\r\nhope that such a decision will be taken, and I would like to\r\nthank all those representatives who have already expressed\r\ntheir support for the Swiss proposal.\r\nIn conclusion, the future development of worldwide\r\neconomic and social conditions hinges upon our ability to\r\nfind innovative solutions. The follow-up to the World\r\nSummit for Social Development, and more particularly its\r\nconference in the year 2000, provide the United Nations\r\nwith an opportunity to meet this challenge. We are\r\nconfident that Geneva has shown its capacity to serve as\r\na host for such an important conference and to contribute\r\nto its success by inspiring the international community to\r\nfind innovative solutions for some of the most urgent\r\nissues facing it at the dawn of the next century.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\ndecision contained in paragraph 87 of document A/53/45,\r\nentitled “Provisional agenda for the first session of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the Special Session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the Implementation of the Outcome\r\nof the World Summit for Social Development and Further\r\nInitiatives”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft decision?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 37.\r\nI should like to inform members that a draft\r\nresolution on this item will be submitted to the Secretariat\r\nat a later date.\r\nAgenda item 118 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nReports of the Fifth Committee (Parts I and II)\r\n(A/53/464 and Add.1)\r\nThe Acting President: If there is no proposal under\r\nrule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of\r\nthe Fifth Committee which are before the Assembly\r\ntoday.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 32nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 7 October 1998\r\nThe Acting President: Statements will therefore be\r\nlimited to explanations of position.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the Fifth Committee have been made\r\nclear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant\r\nofficial records.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the two reports of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that we\r\nare going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner\r\nas was done in the Fifth Committee.\r\nThe Assembly will first turn to part I of the report\r\nof the Fifth Committee (A/53/464).\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\ndecision recommended by the Fifth Committee in\r\nparagraph 7 of part I of its report.\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft decision\r\nwithout a vote.
