(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): This\r\nmorning the General Assembly will proceed to the election\r\nof five non-permanent members of the Security Council to\r\nreplace those members whose term of office expires on 31\r\nDecember 1998.\r\nThe five non-permanent outgoing members are the\r\nfollowing: Costa Rica, Japan, Kenya, Portugal and Sweden.\r\nThose five States cannot be re-elected and therefore their\r\nnames should not appear on the ballot papers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the Security\r\nCouncil will include in 1999 the following States: Bahrain,\r\nBrazil, Gabon, the Gambia and Slovenia. The names of\r\nthose States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members which will remain\r\nin office in 1999, three are from Africa and Asia, one is\r\nfrom Eastern Europe and one is from Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December\r\n1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected\r\naccording to the following pattern: two from Africa and\r\nAsia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean and two\r\nfrom Western European and other States. The ballot\r\npapers reflect this pattern.\r\nIn accordance with established practice, there is an\r\nunderstanding to the effect that, of the two States to be\r\nelected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa\r\nand one from Asia.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the\r\nnumber of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats\r\nto be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a\r\ntwo-thirds majority of those present and voting will be\r\ndeclared elected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there\r\nwill be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates\r\nwhich have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In\r\naccordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the\r\nelection shall be held by secret ballot, and there shall be\r\nno nominations.\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 8 October 1998\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed by the\r\nChairmen of the respective regional groups that for the two\r\nvacant seats from among the African and Asian States there\r\nare two endorsed candidates, namely, Malaysia and\r\nNamibia.\r\nAs for the Latin American and Caribbean States,\r\nArgentina is the endorsed candidate for one vacant seat.\r\nFrom among the Western European and other States,\r\nthere are three candidates for two vacant seats. The\r\ncandidates are Canada, Greece and the Netherlands.\r\nI call on the representative of Swaziland on a point of\r\norder.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): Perhaps members are\r\nsurprised that something unusual is happening today. This\r\nrelates to the circumstances. A renowned scholar and lover\r\nof African literature by the name of Chinua Achebe has\r\nsaid, “When you see a frog crossing your path, you must\r\nknow that something is behind its life”.\r\nMy delegation has asked to make a few remarks; in a\r\nway, I am uttering a prayer on behalf of my delegation, that\r\nas we elect the new members of the Security Council may\r\nGod the Almighty give them wisdom as they carry out the\r\nlaborious tasks that lie before them. I want also to alert\r\nthem to the obstacles they will meet when they get to the\r\nSecurity Council. Experience during my time here dictates\r\nthat they should be vigilant lest their purposes and aims be\r\ninterrupted in the Security Council when they set about\r\ndischarging their duties.\r\nFirst, as is well known, the Security Council is by no\r\nmeans supreme vis-à-vis the General Assembly; it is\r\nexpected to be accountable to the Assembly; it is expected\r\nto be transparent in its activities. Hence, its operations\r\nshould be well known to us all, including to non-members\r\nof the Council. That, according to the Charter, should be\r\ndone by making the debate a public one at times. But to the\r\ndismay of my delegation, we have time and again seen\r\nmeetings of the Security Council conducted behind what I\r\nmay be permitted to call an iron curtain, loosely known as\r\ninformal consultations.\r\nWhen one follows matters, slowly and carefully, in the\r\ncorridors, one learns that these are not just informal\r\nconsultations, but meetings on matters of significance, on\r\nwhich we would all be as interested as members of the\r\nSecurity Council to make our views known.\r\nMy delegation challenges the practice of informal\r\nconsultations. Normal practice dictates that informal\r\nconsultations in the consultations room should be\r\nfollowed by open meetings in which we can all request to\r\nparticipate in an open debate. Therefore, to my colleagues\r\nand to the Member States who will be going to the\r\nSecurity Council, I reiterate my preambular prayer that\r\nGod Almighty give them power and courage so that the\r\npractice of informal consultations and informal meetings\r\nmay come to an end, and so that the culture of the United\r\nNations may be properly followed.\r\nWe are about to exercise our right to vote, and I call\r\nupon those who will be voting, which includes my\r\ndelegation, to pray for the courage to vote for those who\r\nwill heed all our requests. We are about to give birth to\r\na child; if the child is born, it is expected to take\r\ninstructions from the parents. So it is for the Security\r\nCouncil; it must take heed of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich is the supreme body of the United Nations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In\r\naccordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we\r\nshall proceed now to the election by secret ballot.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now be\r\ndistributed.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot\r\npapers that have been distributed and to write on them the\r\nnames of the five States for which they wish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it\r\nwill be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a\r\nballot paper which do not belong to that region will not\r\nbe counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Holíková\r\n(Czech Republic), Mr. Juárez (Mexico) and\r\nMr. Chang (Republic of Korea) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11.20 a.m.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nresult of the voting is as follows:\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 33rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 8 October 1998\r\nGroup A — African and Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 176\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 176\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of Members voting: 176\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 118\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMalaysia 174\r\nNamibia 167\r\nPhilippines 1\r\nSenegal 1\r\nZimbabwe 1\r\nGroup B — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 176\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 176\r\nAbstentions: 4\r\nNumbers of Members voting: 172\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 115\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nArgentina 171\r\nChile 1\r\nGroup C — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 176\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 176\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumbers of Members voting: 175\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 117\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nCanada 131\r\nNetherlands 122\r\nGreece 87\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nthe following States were elected members of the\r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning\r\n1 January 1999: Argentina, Canada, Malaysia,\r\nNamibia and the Netherlands.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\ncongratulate the States which have been elected members\r\nof the Security Council. I also thank the tellers for their\r\nassistance in this important election.\r\nThis concludes our consideration of sub-item (a) of\r\nagenda item 15.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nshould like to draw the attention of the General Assembly\r\nto document A/INF/53/3/Add.1, which covers the period\r\nfrom 8 October through 3 November. Attention of\r\nmembers is drawn particularly to the change of schedule\r\non the consideration of agenda item 11, “Report of the\r\nSecurity Council”. Instead of being taken up on Monday,\r\n12 October, agenda item 11 will now be taken up on\r\nWednesday, 21 October.\r\nOther than the items already cited in the previous\r\nprogramme of work, the lists of speakers for the\r\nadditional i tems mentioned in document\r\nA/INF/53/3/Add.1 will be open as of Friday, 9 October.\r\nThe General Assembly, in due course, will be kept\r\ninformed of the dates for the consideration of other\r\nagenda items as well as of any additions or changes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.30 a.m.\r\n3\r\n"
