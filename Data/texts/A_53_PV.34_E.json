(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mangoaela\r\n(Lesotho), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAgenda item 164\r\nCauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/871)\r\nThe Acting President: I first give the floor to the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: I am privileged to introduce\r\nthis important debate on the report on Africa that I\r\nsubmitted to the Security Council last April and now\r\npresent to the General Assembly. I am also very pleased to\r\nwitness the seriousness with which the Assembly is treating\r\nthe questions posed in the report, for it reflects the\r\nAssembly’s recognition of Africa’s needs and Africa’s\r\nchallenges.\r\nMembers know that the real value of the report will be\r\nmeasured by the tangible, lasting difference that it makes in\r\nthe lives of the poorest and most vulnerable of Africa’s\r\npeoples. That is our challenge and that is our mission.\r\nThe report aims to contribute to Africa’s progress in\r\ntwo distinct, but related, ways: first, by paying the peoples\r\nof Africa the tribute of truth, by honestly and candidly\r\nreporting to the world their challenges and their\r\naspirations; secondly, by proposing realistic and\r\nachievable recommendations for how those challenges\r\nmay be met. In the report, I further emphasized that any\r\nand all efforts at securing peace had to be combined with\r\nsteps towards ending Africa’s poverty.\r\nIn this regard, I emphasized the need for a\r\ncomprehensive response to a challenge that has many\r\nroots and many facets. Specifically, I called for the\r\npromotion of investment and economic growth, of\r\nensuring adequate levels of international aid, of reducing\r\ndebt burdens and opening international markets to\r\nAfrica’s products. These are the aims on which we all can\r\nagree; we can also all agree that they are far from being\r\nmet.\r\nWhile the burden of responsibility for Africa’s fate\r\nlies in Africa’s hands, Africa’s development partners can\r\nalso do more and do better to assist Africa in its struggle\r\nfor lasting prosperity. I am pleased to say that there are\r\nindications that all sides have recognized the urgency of\r\nour common challenge.\r\nLast month, I convened an informal meeting of\r\nMinisters of the Development Assistance Committee\r\n(DAC) countries to highlight five priority areas in\r\nmeeting Africa’s economic challenges. Those are: first,\r\nthe need to increase the volume and improve the quality\r\nof official development assistance; secondly, to consider\r\nconverting all remaining official bilateral debt owed by\r\nthe poorest African countries into grants; thirdly, to\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nliberalize access to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\r\nDebt (HIPC) Initiative; fourthly, to ease access conditions\r\nfor African exports; and fifthly, to encourage investments\r\nin Africa, which has largely been marginalized in the\r\nprocess of globalization.\r\nI am pleased to say that all the Governments\r\nrepresented reaffirmed their support for the\r\nrecommendations in the report, and, in particular, for the\r\nfive priority areas I indicated. Indeed, some Governments\r\nhave already acted on their pledges of support and are\r\ntaking concrete steps. At the same time, they stressed the\r\nneed, on the part of African States, to create the enabling\r\nenvironments for investments and economic growth.\r\nThere must be reciprocity. No one can be expected to\r\ninvest in unstable and insecure neighbourhoods. This goes\r\nfor domestic investors as well as international investors. It\r\nplaces enormous responsibilities on African leaders to end\r\nthe current political crisis on the continent and to work\r\ntogether to bring peace through political means and accept\r\nthat one cannot use military means to solve these problems.\r\nSince the meeting with the DAC Ministers, I have had\r\na number of opportunities to emphasize to donors and other\r\ninternational organizations the importance of these\r\ninitiatives. Last Tuesday I met with Mr. Robert Rubin,\r\nUnited States Secretary of the Treasury, to discuss the\r\ncurrent global economic situation, in particular the crisis of\r\nglobalization and the United Nations response. I also urged\r\nimmediate and dramatic action on the debt situation facing\r\nAfrica’s poorest nations, particularly in these dark days of\r\nglobal economic crisis.\r\nI pointed out that none of these countries had played\r\nany part in this crisis, but they are all suffering from its\r\nfallout, not least due to the fall in commodity prices. I\r\nagain stressed the need to ease access to the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and urged that its\r\nrequirements be made more flexible to allow genuine relief.\r\nAs many representatives know, numerous initiatives in\r\nthe political and economic fields are under way as part of\r\nthe follow-up to the report. Most immediately, I will be\r\nconvening a discussion on debt relief by the Panel of High-\r\nlevel Personalities on African Development next week and\r\nexpect to hear new and innovative ideas for how we may\r\nbe more effective in our efforts to end Africa’s debt\r\nproblem.\r\nI am confident that the decision of the General\r\nAssembly to consider my report will add renewed\r\nmomentum to its implementation and inspire all who\r\nlabour in Africa’s service to do more and do better.\r\nAllow me to conclude by noting the added urgency\r\nof our challenge in a time when the global economy is\r\nfacing serious threats and when millions the world over\r\nhave been thrown back into a life of poverty after years\r\nof struggle and success. This crisis is now a threat not\r\nonly to Africa’s prospects for growth, but also to Africa’s\r\nattempts to secure free and democratic societies.\r\nWe must succeed, for we cannot afford to fail.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): My first duty is to congratulate the President and\r\nthe other members of the Bureau who have been elected\r\nto preside over the fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly. I venture to assert that Africa is confident that\r\nthey will help it assist the entire international community\r\nin making progress along the path of peace and progress.\r\nPeace and progress are precisely the focus of our\r\nconcerns today during this debate on the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development\r\nin Africa. On behalf of the African States and as current\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nBurkina Faso would like to hail the initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General, who has given the Assembly an\r\nopportunity to address the issues of a continent where\r\nendless conflicts and economic disparities have put it at\r\nthe forefront of our concerns recently.\r\nIt is virtually a commonplace to say that the\r\nsituation in Africa now is a problem of concern to the\r\ninternational community, and above all, to those whose\r\nprimary function it is to guarantee peace and collective\r\nsecurity — namely, the United Nations. Not that this\r\nOrganization has shirked its responsibilities in this field.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General more than adequately\r\ndemonstrates the interest the United Nations has in our\r\ncontinent and its problems. In addition, based on its\r\nexperience in the Congo in 1960, the United Nations has\r\nbecome involved in other operations, such as those in\r\nSomalia, Angola and the Central African Republic. But\r\nwe believe that it should be still further involved at a time\r\nwhen Africa is prey to serious conflicts which are\r\ndangerously impeding its development efforts.\r\nAs we are all aware, in addition to those that I have\r\njust mentioned, crises and conflicts are now causing\r\nconflagrations between Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Guinea-Bissau.\r\nAfrica is daily demonstrating its determination to settle\r\nthese fratricidal wars through peaceful means.\r\nAs regards Eritrea and Ethiopia, several mediation\r\nattempts have already taken place under the aegis of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, and it is expected that they\r\nwill resume shortly in Ouagadougou, perhaps even at the\r\nend of this month. Regarding Guinea-Bissau, the joint\r\nefforts of the subregional organization of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) are\r\nattempting to find a solution to this difficult problem.\r\nMoreover, the current Chairman of the OAU intends to\r\narrange in December a summit meeting of member States\r\nof the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution in Africa in order to achieve a just and lasting\r\nresolution of the various crises which are undermining the\r\ncontinent.\r\nWe are aware, however, that the efforts of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity to find African solutions to\r\nthese African problems must be supported by the\r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nThis was the thrust of the appeal recently made by\r\nBurkina Faso President Blaise Compaoré, the current\r\nChairman of the OAU, when he stated before the General\r\nAssembly that\r\n“the management of conflict situations often requires\r\nthe deployment of a level of human, material and\r\nfinancial resources beyond the capacities of our\r\ncountries. Thus, international organizations should\r\ncontinue to show solidarity and partnership with\r\nAfrica”. (A/53/PV.7)\r\nAs the Secretary-General emphasizes in the report\r\nbefore us,\r\n“Despite a number of important successes, the\r\ninability of the United Nations to restore peace to\r\nSomalia soured international support for conflict\r\nintervention and precipitated a rapid retreat by the\r\ninternational community from peacekeeping\r\nworldwide. An early and direct consequence of this\r\nretreat was the failure of the international community,\r\nincluding the United Nations, to intervene to prevent\r\ngenocide in Rwanda.” (A/52/871, para. 11)\r\nWhether or not this is true, it does not absolve us of\r\nthe duty to re-establish equilibrium, first, by working to\r\nrestore confidence between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican peoples, whom, as we have seen, may be feeling\r\nthat the Organization is not interested in their difficulties;\r\nand secondly, by persuading the United Nations to\r\ninvolve itself further in these crises and thereby\r\ndemonstrate its universal nature and, above all, its\r\ndetermination to guarantee world order.\r\nAside from all these considerations, the starting point\r\nmust of course, be genuine political will. In the section of\r\nhis report devoted to summoning the necessary political\r\nwill, the Secretary-General stresses the respective\r\nresponsibilities of Africa and the international community\r\nin this regard. For its part, Africa, in the Ouagadougou\r\nDeclaration adopted at the thirty-fourth ordinary session\r\nof the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment, provides clear indications of that will. In the\r\nDeclaration, the heads of State and Government recognize\r\nunequivocally that political issues are primarily national\r\nand undertake to work towards the establishment and\r\nconsolidation of effective democratic systems.\r\nThe Declaration gives priority to respect for human\r\nrights; the eradication of impunity; the establishment of\r\nsystems of government based on ongoing social dialogue\r\nand the search for political consensus; ending exclusion\r\nby involving all sectors, without discrimination, in the\r\nmanagement of public affairs; the fight against the illicit\r\nproliferation of weapons, in particular light arms; the drug\r\ntrade; the eradication of cross-border crime; and the\r\npromotion of credible and independent justice accessible\r\nto all.\r\nAfrica hopes that the international community will\r\nback the will strongly expressed in the Ouagadougou\r\nDeclaration by supporting it in all its aspects. It hopes\r\nthat the international community will support this effort\r\nby discharging its responsibilities and, in accordance with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recommendation, by easing the\r\nfinancial conditions imposed by the international financial\r\ninstitutions on countries in crisis, inter alia, by promoting\r\nsocial development, restructuring and reducing the debt\r\nburden, truly opening the international markets to African\r\nproducts, strongly supporting regional cooperation and\r\nintegration, and not fuelling conflicts for economic\r\nbenefit.\r\nThese considerations prompt me to address another\r\nimportant aspect of the African situation: economic\r\nproblems or, more precisely, the problem of development.\r\nIn this respect, too, the Secretary-General’s report\r\nreminds us most relevantly that the promotion of lasting\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\npeace on our continent requires significant economic\r\ndevelopment, because the interaction between peace and\r\ndevelopment is truly real and ineluctable. It is on the basis\r\nof this observation that the current Chairman of the OAU,\r\nPresident Blaise Compaoré, intends to convene next year an\r\neconomic summit on Africa to seek solutions to these\r\nthorny economic problems.\r\nThe proposals and initiatives to emerge from the\r\nsummit should be not a catalogue of pious wishes, but\r\nrather an innovative and new therapy for coping with the\r\nproblems of impoverishment and famine and, above all, for\r\nestablishing our countries on the road to globalization. We,\r\nor rather the myriad experts, have over-diagnosed Africa’s\r\nills. We now need strong medicine to overcome\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nThe economic summit must therefore not be just\r\nanother meeting and we must prepare it with maximum\r\ncare and judiciousness. Since it will be our gateway to the\r\ntwenty-first century, it must fulfil all hopes and all\r\nexpectations. The support for this conference that has\r\nalready been promised by the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Administrator of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the President of the World\r\nBank guarantees the serious results that we anticipate from\r\nit.\r\nFor now, we must deplore the serious economic\r\nupheavals and trade disparities from which Africa continues\r\nto suffer under an unjust international system, compounded\r\nby the burden of relentless debt to which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral referred earlier, despite the few relief measures\r\nundertaken by some countries and multilateral agencies. I\r\nmust also mention the vagaries of such natural disasters as\r\nfloods and drought and of such endemic diseases as AIDS\r\nand malaria, all of which hamper the development of our\r\ncontinent.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish again to congratulate most\r\nsincerely Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the depth and\r\nclarity of his report on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica. His ideas provide the Security Council with an\r\nopportunity to act beyond making statements, which,\r\nhowever necessary, are insufficient. We must act not only\r\nto end the current conflicts battering Africa, but also to\r\nspare other peoples these horrendous tragedies.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish most sincerely to thank the\r\nUnited Nations for its efforts in peacekeeping and\r\npromoting sustainable development in Africa. We hope that\r\nit will become even further involved and, in particular,\r\nrespond as rapidly to the conflicts in Africa as it does\r\nelsewhere in the world. We also hope that the United\r\nNations operational development system, despite its\r\nlimited resources, will continue to support our\r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. In addition, the Central\r\nand Eastern European countries associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated country\r\nCyprus, as well as the European Free Trade Association\r\ncountry member of the European Economic Area, Iceland,\r\nalign themselves with this statement.\r\nTo stay within the time limits set I will focus my\r\nintervention on the main issues it covers, its full text\r\nbeing made available in English and French.\r\nLet me first thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nimportant introduction today and for the leadership he has\r\nshown on this item throughout. We would, on behalf of\r\nthe European Union, like to take this opportunity to\r\nreiterate our appreciation to the Secretary-General for the\r\nreport before us on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development\r\nin Africa.\r\nOur discussions on the follow-up to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report take place at a very timely moment. On\r\nthe one hand, we are able to observe signs of political\r\nand socio-economic progress, sometimes referred to under\r\nthe expression “African Renaissance”. On the other hand,\r\nviolent conflicts are spreading over parts of the continent,\r\nwith the risk even of their escalating into open regional\r\nwar. Africa is at a crossroads. We therefore highly value\r\nthe integrated approach taken in the report to prevent\r\nviolent conflicts as well as its focus on human security\r\nand sustainable human development, two issues which are\r\nintrinsically linked. It is indeed appropriate that, following\r\nthe deliberations in the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly now addresses the report focusing on issues\r\nunder its own purview.\r\n“With sufficient political will on the part of\r\nAfrica and on the part of the international\r\ncommunity peace and development in Africa can be\r\ngiven a new momentum.” (A/52/871, para. 104)\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nThose are the words of the Secretary-General.\r\nMobilizing this political will called for by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the European Union is currently preparing for a\r\nsummit with the African States in the year 2000. While\r\navoiding overlaps with other existing forums, this summit\r\nwill offer a unique opportunity to debate political and\r\neconomic subjects of common interest at the highest\r\npolitical level. In addition, we are pleased to host a\r\nministerial meeting between the European Union and the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) in\r\nVienna in November 1998. Finally, to have words followed\r\nby deeds, the European Union, as the major donor to\r\nAfrica, contributing two thirds of total official development\r\nassistance flows to sub-Saharan Africa, and as the most\r\nopen market for these countries, is committed to renewing\r\nthe partnership agreement with the African, Caribbean and\r\nPacific countries and transforming the Lomé Convention\r\ninto an even more modern and efficient framework for\r\ncooperation which will remain strong and prominent in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s emphasis on the importance of human rights,\r\ndemocracy and good governance in the process of achieving\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development throughout the\r\nAfrican continent. Since 1995 the European Union has\r\nadopted several documents which form the current basis of\r\nthe European Union policy on violent conflicts in Africa.\r\nThe European Union is committed to addressing potential\r\ntrouble spots at a very early stage and to strengthen early-\r\nwarning capacities. This means a focus on the root causes,\r\nlike the imbalance of political, socio-economic or cultural\r\nopportunities among different identity groups, the lack of\r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of governance, the absence of\r\neffective mechanisms for the peaceful conciliation of group\r\ninterests and the lack of a vibrant civil society. Electoral\r\nassistance or the deployment of election observers, support\r\nin the development of democratic institutions, improved\r\npublic sector management and the establishment of\r\ntransparent independent judicial processes, all of which\r\npromote the rule of law and economic and financial\r\ndevelopment, are key priorities in this respect.\r\nThe Union believes that Africans must take the lead as\r\nwell as the main responsibility for the prevention and\r\nresolution of violent conflict. At the same time, the\r\ninternational community, including, of course, the European\r\nUnion, cannot be indifferent and will not be indifferent to\r\nevents in Africa. The Union actively supports efforts to\r\nenhance African capacities and means of action in the field\r\nof conflict prevention and resolution, in particular through\r\nsupport for initiatives of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and subregional organizations. Post-conflict\r\nreconstruction and peace-building aimed at the prevention\r\nof future conflicts is more than repairing physical\r\ninfrastructure. The purpose of peace-building efforts is to\r\naddress the root causes of violent conflicts in a targeted\r\nmanner. In this respect, development cooperation has to\r\nplay an important role.\r\nThe European Union fully shares the view of the\r\nSecretary-General that protecting human rights and in\r\nparticular political rights and economic freedoms,\r\npromoting transparency and accountability in public\r\nadministration and fighting corruption are not merely\r\ncrucial in building peace and promoting development, but\r\nare indeed prerequisites.\r\nThe dramatic and unacceptable deterioration in the\r\nadherence to international humanitarian law and its\r\nunderlying principles in violent conflicts, afflicting\r\ncivilians and humanitarian personnel, equally calls for a\r\nsolution. Ninety per cent of\r\ncasualties in today’s violent conflicts are civilian, the\r\nmajority of them women and children. The European\r\nUnion wants to draw attention to the social and economic\r\nconsequences of violent conflict on women, and reiterates\r\nthat a gender perspective has to be fully taken into\r\nconsideration. The European Union fully endorses the\r\nSecretary-General’s notion of children as “zones of\r\npeace”, and calls upon all States and parties to conflicts\r\nto respect existing international standards, to stop the use\r\nof children as combatants and to fully support the work\r\nof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for\r\nChildren in Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu.\r\nThe adoption of the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court, which the European Union worked so\r\nhard to achieve, is a significant step forward in bringing\r\nto justice those responsible, and therefore ending a culture\r\nof impunity. The Union considers the adoption of the\r\nStatute a milestone achievement, and once more urges all\r\nMember States to speedily ratify the Statute, in order for\r\nthe Court to come into operation as soon as possible.\r\nHumanitarian action has to address humanitarian\r\nneeds and has to facilitate recovery and reconstruction\r\nefforts. The Union welcomes the specific\r\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General, which\r\nshould be followed up collectively. In this context, the\r\nUnion draws attention to the proposals contained in the\r\nEuropean Commission’s working document on “Security\r\nof Relief Workers and Humanitarian Space” to limit the\r\nflow of arms into conflict-prone areas before and during\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nconflict; to understand the economic dynamics of war and\r\nthe danger of feeding the war machine through aid and\r\ntrade policies; and to use humanitarian assistance to\r\nstrengthen local structures and increase self-sufficiency. The\r\nCommission also proposed that humanitarian aid has to\r\nrespect international humanitarian law and humanitarian\r\nprinciples, that humanitarian activities have to encompass\r\nhuman rights and that foreign policy should provide the\r\nframework for humanitarian action and be consistent with\r\nhumanitarian objectives.\r\nThe European Union is currently engaged in the\r\nimplementation of the European Union Programme for\r\nPreventing and Combating Illicit Trafficking in\r\nConventional Arms. The Union welcomes the regional\r\nefforts to combat the illicit transfer and excessive\r\naccumulation of small arms emanating from Africa and\r\nstands ready to cooperate with those initiatives.\r\nIn the aftermath of conflict, humanitarian assistance\r\nmust be a step towards development, and must be delivered\r\nto promote long-term development objectives. In this phase,\r\na mix of activities and partnerships is needed. Development\r\nplanning should be undertaken already during a conflict\r\nwith the aim of building a constituency for peace and\r\nstability. In this respect more sophisticated consolidated\r\nappeals and strategic frameworks would be of essential\r\nimportance.\r\nThe struggle against widespread poverty in Africa\r\ncontinues to be one of the biggest challenges of our time.\r\nThe growth already achieved must be maintained and\r\naccelerated. To be fair and lasting, it must benefit all\r\nsections of society, taking into account environmental\r\nconcerns.\r\nThe European Union remains committed to the\r\nstruggle against poverty and the goal of halving the\r\nproportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report contains the bold vision\r\nrequired to translate the current recovery into a lasting\r\ntransformation that will set Africa on a course of\r\nsustainable human development.\r\nLike the Secretary-General, we believe that there is\r\nreason to stress the particular importance of certain aspects\r\nof proper management of public affairs. We also agree with\r\nthe Secretary-General that if we wish to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment there is a need for a basic strategy centred,\r\ninter alia, on macroeconomic stability and a stable\r\ninvestment environment, and that further economic reform\r\nmeasures are also called for.\r\nIn the context of a renewed partnership with Africa,\r\nthe European Union is committed to the general strategy\r\nrecommended in the report. True partnership implies\r\nreciprocal commitments. We welcome the increased\r\nefforts of African Governments to promote an enabling\r\nenvironment for investment, economic growth that will\r\nbenefit the poor, social progress and private sector\r\ndevelopment. We are prepared to step up to the greatest\r\nextent possible our support for countries engaged in such\r\nprocesses, in particular with regard to the reform of\r\ninstitutional and legal frameworks and the improvement\r\nof public service efficiency. It is of fundamental\r\nimportance that the countries involved have control over\r\nand responsibility for their development and reform\r\nstrategies. Formulas based on participatory approaches\r\nand consultation mechanisms are also essential for\r\nsuccess. In addition, we welcome the call for regional\r\nintegration of African countries, and we are prepared to\r\nlend such integration our continuous support.\r\nThe European Union also wishes to emphasize the\r\nimportance it attaches to incorporating ecological\r\nconcerns into all strategies designed to ensure sustainable\r\ndevelopment. In the current African context, the subject\r\nof desertification is of particular concern.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the fact that the\r\nreport singles out social development. Human and social\r\ndevelopment is synonymous with a people-oriented\r\napproach, and therefore should be at the centre of the\r\ndesign and implementation of macroeconomic policies.\r\nEconomic progress must benefit all members of society.\r\nIt is still of the utmost importance to eliminate all forms\r\nof discrimination against women and girls in Africa. In\r\nthis context, the European Union is committed to\r\ndeveloping a political dialogue with its African partners\r\non these issues, and is incorporating a perspective of\r\ngender equality into the regulations and guidelines that\r\ngovern its development cooperation programmes. Finally,\r\na sufficiently high level of financial resources, in\r\nparticular for basic health and education services, must be\r\nsecured through such mechanisms as the 20/20 Initiative\r\nlaunched in Copenhagen. In this context, we welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s comment in paragraph 27 of the\r\nreport, stressing that\r\n“Africa’s compelling development interests require\r\nthat a minimum of resources be diverted for military\r\npurposes.”\r\nExternal debt continues to be a serious impediment\r\nto sustainable development for many poor developing\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\ncountries. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative provides a good opportunity to bring the\r\ndebt back to a sustainable level, and should be speedily\r\nextended to more countries on the terms agreed upon. On\r\ntop of the debt relief already granted within the framework\r\nof the Paris Club and on a national basis, in particular\r\nthrough the cancellation of official bilateral debt and debt\r\nconversion arrangements, the European Union will fully\r\nparticipate in the HIPC Initiative in order to alleviate the\r\ndebt burden of the poorest countries.\r\nGiven that 99 per cent of Community imports\r\noriginating in sub-Saharan African countries already benefit\r\nfrom preferential, duty-free access in the context of the\r\nLomé Convention, enhancing their position in the European\r\nmarket will primarily have to be achieved through\r\nimproving their competitiveness and the production and\r\nexport capacities of the African economies. To this end, the\r\nEuropean Union is aiming, in its negotiations with the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific countries, formally opened\r\non 30 September, to progressively transform the old form\r\nof trade cooperation into a real economic partnership.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General stresses the need\r\nto reorient international aid, with a view to reducing the\r\ndependency of the partner countries, promoting the\r\nimplementation of the primary objectives of social\r\ndevelopment and increasing the competitiveness of African\r\neconomies. Concerned to establish genuine partnership, the\r\nEuropean Union is basing its assistance on the following\r\nprinciples: control of processes by Governments; shared\r\nresponsibility and participation; dialogue; contractual\r\nrelations rather than conditionality; fulfilment of mutual\r\nobligations; and a flexible approach adapted to partners’\r\nlevel of development, needs and long-term development\r\nstrategy.\r\nThe European Union is the world’s leading source of\r\ndevelopment assistance to Africa, providing more than two\r\nthirds of total official development assistance flows to sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. Development assistance remains a vital\r\ncomplement to the policies pursued by the African\r\ncountries. We are actively involved in improving\r\noperational coordination of development cooperation both\r\namong ourselves and with partner Governments and other\r\ninternational development actors, such as the United\r\nNations system. It is also crucial to ensure greater\r\ncoherence between our development policy and other\r\npolicies likely to affect the developing countries.\r\nAllow me, in conclusion, to reaffirm that the European\r\nUnion fully supports the Secretary-General’s call for\r\nconcrete action on the part of both the African countries\r\nand the international community to create a new\r\nmomentum for peace and development in Africa. The\r\ninternational community cannot be indifferent to events in\r\nAfrica. For the European Union, Africa’s sustainable\r\ndevelopment is a priority. The commitment of the\r\nEuropean Union to Africa is based on shared interests,\r\nvalues and objectives. We wish to help Africa to achieve\r\npeace, stability and sustainable development, in order to\r\nimprove the quality of life of its people.\r\nFinally, the European Union is ready to begin\r\ndiscussion with interested delegations on how the General\r\nAssembly can respond to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that is before us.\r\nMr. Petrella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for Argentina and for me\r\npersonally to speak so early in this important debate, and\r\nwhile you, Sir, the representative of an African country,\r\nare in the Chair.\r\nI wish to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\npragmatic and objective report on the causes of conflict\r\nin Africa. With its integrated and comprehensive\r\napproach, it shows clearly that economic and social\r\ndevelopment are not possible without the right\r\nenvironment of peace and stability. At the same time, the\r\nreport makes it plain that until the basic needs of human\r\nbeings are met, and as long as deep inequalities persist,\r\nthere will always be a threat of conflict.\r\nThe Secretary-General does not limit himself to\r\nmerely analysing the historical and current sources of\r\nconflict in Africa: he offers specific proposals designed to\r\novercome them. We have already started down that path.\r\nWith regard to peace and security, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the subregional organizations\r\nhave strengthened their conflict prevention mechanisms\r\nand early warning systems and have played a crucial role\r\nin the return of democratic institutions in Liberia and\r\nSierra Leone. Regional efforts aimed at bringing about the\r\npeaceful resolution of outstanding conflicts are being\r\ncarried out intelligently and in a spirit of conciliation.\r\nSimilarly, African contingents are participating actively in\r\nthe United Nations Mission in the Central African\r\nRepublic (MINURCA) with the aim of consolidating that\r\ncountry’s democratic process, as well as in other\r\npeacekeeping operations, and they are doing so with a\r\nhigh degree of dedication and professionalism.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nFor its part, the Security Council, heeding the appeal\r\nof the Secretary-General, has held two ministerial-level\r\nmeetings in one year and has created an ad hoc Working\r\nGroup under resolution 1170 (1998). That Working Group\r\nhas already recommended specific measures to make arms\r\nembargoes more effective and to strengthen Africa’s\r\npeacekeeping capacity. We encourage the ad hoc Working\r\nGroup to continue its work and to present recommendations\r\non three very important issues: the need to curb illicit flows\r\nof weapons; the adoption of measures designed to help host\r\nGovernments preserve the security and neutrality of refugee\r\ncamps; and enhancing the capacity of the Security Council\r\nto supervise activities authorized by it but carried out by\r\nMember States or coalitions of Member States.\r\nWith regard to economic and social development, we\r\ncan attest that most African countries are making efforts to\r\nstrengthen their democratic institutions, promote human\r\nrights and reform their economies. However, as the\r\nSecretary-General has stated, the heavy burden of external\r\ndebt and the decline in the prices of their export products\r\nare hindering their incorporation into an increasingly\r\nglobalized world. The international community, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization must\r\ndo their utmost to ensure that those obstacles do not prove\r\ninsurmountable. In particular, the United Nations should\r\nfollow the lead of the Secretary-General and speak for the\r\nmost disadvantaged, smallest and weakest countries. Its role\r\nin promoting development should be focused mainly on\r\nthose countries. Any approach that takes a different course\r\nshould first be carefully evaluated. The principle of good\r\ninternational citizenship entails minimum levels of\r\ndevelopment, and the most prosperous among us should\r\nmaintain our commitment to its achievement.\r\nIn keeping with this approach, Argentina has made the\r\ngreatest possible efforts to promote those two objectives. At\r\nthe multilateral level, together with interested African\r\ncountries, we have worked for the establishment of a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Atlantic.\r\nFurthermore, on 21 and 22 October this year, Argentina\r\nwill host the fifth ministerial meeting of the members of the\r\nZone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic,\r\nwhich comprises 21 African States and three Latin\r\nAmerican States committed to the principles of territorial\r\nintegrity, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the rule of law\r\nand human and social development.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping operations, Argentina\r\ncurrently has a presence in Angola and Western Sahara. We\r\nagain reaffirm our offer to provide training through the\r\ntraining centre for peacekeepers in Buenos Aires.\r\nIn the area of humanitarian assistance, Argentina\r\nhas, through the “White Helmets” initiative, carried out\r\nmine clearance tasks in Angola. We also have plans to\r\nparticipate in mine clearance and health care activities in\r\nSomalia and have undertaken to deliver and distribute\r\nfood aid in Sierra Leone with the assistance of the “White\r\nHelmets”.\r\nIn this same spirit of solidarity, through the\r\nArgentine horizontal cooperation fund we are putting into\r\neffect a set of mutual cooperation programmes with\r\nvarious African countries in areas as diverse as training\r\nin agriculture and livestock, pest eradication,\r\ncomputerization and reform of the State. On 4 and 5 May,\r\nin Harare, Zimbabwe, a seminar on State reform was\r\nheld, with the aim of having a mutual exchange of\r\nexperiences. The seminar was attended by high-level\r\nofficials from Angola, Namibia, Malawi, Lesotho,\r\nMozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Argentina.\r\nWe are also convinced that electoral monitoring\r\nmechanisms are an important tool for strengthening\r\ndemocratic systems and good governance. Argentina sent\r\nelectoral observers to the first election in South Africa\r\nbased on free and universal suffrage, which put an end to\r\napartheid, to the referendum on self-determination in\r\nEritrea and to the legislative elections held in Algeria in\r\nJune 1997. We are ready to offer our cooperation in the\r\nfuture if interested States so request.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General truly challenges\r\nus to seek concrete and realistic solutions. Faced with this\r\nchallenge, which extends to everyone — to the African\r\nleadership and to the international community — we\r\ncannot remain indifferent to the situation of the men and\r\nwomen of Africa. We have a moral responsibility to act\r\nand to do so without delay.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): We meet today in this\r\nAssembly to deliberate upon an issue of vital importance\r\nto the international community as a whole. The question\r\nis how to avert further conflict and to promote\r\nconfidence-building measures, as well as sustainable\r\ndevelopment, in Africa. This item was debated earlier this\r\nyear in the Security Council following the issuance of a\r\nreport by the Secretary-General on 13 April 1998. Many\r\ndelegations which spoke in the Council urged that the\r\nmatter also be considered by the larger membership in the\r\nGeneral Assembly and in the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. My delegation noted with keen interest the\r\nfurther consideration of this question by the Security\r\nCouncil last month.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report issued in April this year and for his\r\nsuccinct and focused introduction to the subject this\r\nmorning, which provides a framework for this important\r\ndebate.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of recent convulsions in the\r\nAfrican continent, no endeavour is more important and\r\nurgent than a sincere and concerted international effort to\r\nclose the chapter of violence which has traumatized the\r\nmajority of the people of the African continent for so long.\r\nMy delegation notes with concern the serious deterioration\r\nin the situation in some parts of Africa in the last six\r\nmonths since the issuance of the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nThere has unfortunately been a steady and alarming\r\ndecline in the quality of life in Africa since the 1980s.\r\nAfrican economies, already the weakest and the most\r\nfragile in the world, have been further undermined by\r\ncontinuing civil strife in many parts of the continent.\r\nGlobalization has also caused some of the African\r\neconomies to be further marginalized. As a developing\r\ncountry, Malaysia fully sympathizes with the plight of our\r\nbrothers and sisters in Africa.\r\nThe initiative by the United Nations aimed at\r\nconfidence-building and promoting common security and\r\ndevelopment in Africa is a major step in the right direction.\r\nThe goal that we seek in this endeavour should be lasting\r\npeace and security. We should assist the African economies\r\nto grow, relieve the millions of poor from disease, poverty\r\nand hunger and encourage the peoples of the affected\r\nregions in Africa to fully utilize their potential to provide\r\na better future for their children. We should endeavour to\r\nconceive a concrete strategy that identifies specific\r\nmeasures to be pursued towards meeting that objective. My\r\ndelegation recognizes that the primary responsibility lies in\r\nthe hands of the Governments and the States of Africa\r\nthemselves. They have the right and obligation to take\r\ncharge of their own destinies. However, the international\r\ncommunity can and should assist them when called upon to\r\ndo so.\r\nThe alarming frequency of armed conflict clearly calls\r\nfor a commitment on the part of all concerned to make\r\nevery effort to settle disputes by peaceful means.\r\nDiplomacy cannot work miracles, especially when one party\r\nto a dispute believes it stands to gain from resort to force.\r\nThus, all of us, African or non-African, should reaffirm the\r\nuniversal commitment to the spirit of Article 33 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the pursuit of all possible\r\npeaceful means to prevent armed conflict and the outbreak\r\nof war in respect of Africa. It is especially important that\r\nStates outside of Africa honour this commitment and not\r\ntake unilateral actions which could further endanger the\r\npeace and security situation in Africa.\r\nMalaysia shares the view that lasting peace and\r\nsecurity on the African continent can be assured only\r\nthrough long-term measures. A comprehensive and\r\ndetermined approach in the quest for peace in Africa, as\r\nin the rest of the world, must necessarily include the\r\neradication of poverty, promotion of democracy,\r\ndevelopment of good governance, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the establishment of the rule of law and\r\nrespect for human rights. However, we must accept that\r\nany measure taken should take full cognizance of the\r\npeculiar situation of each country or region.\r\nEfforts at preventing armed conflict should continue\r\nin parts of Africa where the potential for conflict remains\r\nhigh. My delegation welcomes the recent adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1196 (1998) and 1197 (1998)\r\naimed at strengthening both the effectiveness of arms\r\nembargoes in conflict areas and the African peacekeeping\r\ncapacity. We agree with the Secretary-General’s assertion\r\nthat the uncontrolled flow of arms increases tension and\r\ninsecurity in potential conflict areas and destabilizes the\r\ncontinent. However, if these resolutions are to be\r\neffective, efforts have to be stepped up to ensure full\r\ncompliance.\r\nWe wish to reiterate our support for efforts to further\r\nintensify cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations in early warning systems and\r\npreventive diplomacy. We commend the role played by\r\nthe Organization of African Unity in averting potential\r\nconflicts in Africa. The role played by various African\r\nsubregional organizations — namely, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States in Liberia and Sierra\r\nLeone, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development\r\nin Somalia and southern Sudan and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo as well as the Community of Portuguese-\r\nSpeaking Countries in Guinea-Bissau — deserves our\r\nsupport and commendation. These organizations, however,\r\nrequire the full backing of the international community to\r\nenable them to undertake preventive diplomacy in\r\naccordance with their expressed mandate within the\r\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe subject of sanctions continues to be a matter of\r\ngreat concern to United Nations Member States. My\r\ndelegation strongly feels that sanctions should be applied\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nwith great caution and should be resorted to only in cases\r\nof extreme necessity, when other peaceful options provided\r\nfor in the Charter have been proved inadequate. Sanctions\r\ncannot be used as an instrument for promoting the narrow\r\nnational interests of individual Member States. Sanctions,\r\nwhen deemed absolutely necessary, should have specific\r\nobjectives, be clearly targeted and have specific time-frames\r\nso as to reduce humanitarian costs. They should be subject\r\nto periodic reviews with a view to their early termination\r\nwhen they have served their specific purpose. My\r\ndelegation also believes that the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and other relevant organs of the United\r\nNations should intensify efforts to address the special\r\neconomic problems of third countries affected by sanctions\r\nregimes. My delegation notes with regret that quite a\r\nnumber of African States have been affected by ongoing\r\nsanctions. Efforts must be made to reduce the direct and\r\nindirect burdens brought about by such sanctions regimes\r\nupon third countries, particularly those in Africa.\r\nPeace and security are inextricably linked to the\r\npromotion of development. No business concern would\r\nwant to invest in countries where capital is not protected\r\nand where markets cannot thrive and prosper. Political\r\nstability is a critical factor in attracting foreign direct\r\ninvestment and capital essential for development and\r\ngrowth. In the absence of such conditions, many of the\r\ndeveloping countries in Africa would find it impossible to\r\nembark upon serious development programmes. They will\r\nhave to continue to depend on official development\r\nassistance, which, unfortunately, has been declining in\r\nrecent years. My delegation urges the developed countries\r\nto increase the volume and quality of official development\r\nassistance to those African countries that badly need such\r\nassistance. Malaysia also supports the call for greater access\r\nfor African products into international markets. It is\r\nestimated that a minimum growth rate of at least 6 per cent\r\nper annum is required if Africa is to avoid continued\r\nmarginalization and to begin to attain sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It is thus very important also that the\r\nmultilateral financial institutions give priority to efforts\r\naimed at boosting the economic potential of the African\r\ncountries.\r\nOf equal importance is the need to reduce Africa’s\r\ndebt burden to more manageable levels. My delegation\r\nsupports the call by the Secretary-General for the\r\nconsideration of converting into grants official bilateral\r\ndebts owed by the poorest African nations. This is critical\r\nif Africa is to progress in the long term. Such debts impede\r\npublic investment in physical infrastructure and human\r\nresources. They also impede foreign direct investment. We\r\nnote that the 1998 report of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development states that Africa\r\nowes the international community a total of $256 billion.\r\nIt is unfortunate that some African countries have got into\r\ndebt as a result of high spending related to arms\r\npurchases. It is of course the right of States to provide for\r\nadequate defence and security. However, it may be worth\r\nwhile for African States to consider reducing substantially\r\ntheir defence budgets and, in particular, arms purchases.\r\nMy delegation recognizes that this may be difficult to\r\nimplement initially, but it is necessary in order to\r\ninculcate a new culture of peace in Africa. A strong\r\ncommitment to that objective could assist in bringing\r\nabout greater confidence on the part of its external\r\npartners, thus helping to attract badly needed foreign\r\ninvestment and assistance.\r\nMalaysia’s interest in Africa and the well-being of\r\nits people is not a recent development. Since its\r\nindependence Malaysia has maintained very cordial and\r\nlong-standing relations with countries in North Africa as\r\nwell as with countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We have\r\nrejoiced in African successes and empathized with the\r\npain and suffering of the people of Africa. The friendship\r\nthat has developed is certainly based on a strong sense of\r\nsolidarity and partnership. Four years into our\r\nindependence, Malaysian soldiers participated in United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations in the Congo. We have\r\nbeen able to apply lessons learned there to our further\r\nparticipation in some 18 other United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations the world over, including eight\r\nin Africa. Today, Malaysian soldiers and policemen are\r\npresent in the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola\r\nand in the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in\r\nWestern Sahara. In the past, Malaysia’s involvements in\r\nAfrica included the United Nations Observer Mission in\r\nLiberia, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group\r\nin Namibia, the United Nations Operation in Mozambique\r\nand the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM\r\nII).\r\nMalaysia values its association and collaboration\r\nwith the African countries at the United Nations, in the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, in the Group of 77, in the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and in other\r\norganizations and forums. We have cooperated on many\r\nissues, such as the debt problem, increased trade and\r\ninvestment, commodities, South-South and North-South\r\ncooperation and questions relating to global peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nIn a spirit of South-South cooperation, Malaysia has\r\nsince 1981 been engaged in a technical cooperation\r\nprogramme with our partners in the South. We are pleased\r\nthat the programme has been well received by some 99\r\ndeveloping countries. To date, more than 3,600 participants,\r\nmainly from Africa, have undergone technical training and\r\nvarious short-term courses in Malaysia. We hope that the\r\nparticipants and their countries have benefitted from this\r\nprogramme. Despite our current economic situation, we\r\nremain committed to continuing to carry out this\r\nprogramme.\r\nWith certain African countries Malaysia has also\r\ndeveloped economic relations based on the concept of smart\r\npartnership. We endeavour to promote economic activities\r\nin a sound and sustainable manner to ensure that fair and\r\nmutually beneficial win-win relationships can be forged.\r\nHigh priority is accorded to encouraging more trade and\r\ninvestment. A number of African leaders and corporate\r\nfigures have given similar priority to this concept. A\r\nprocess of dialogue has been established through the\r\nLangkawi International Dialogue, the Southern African\r\nInternational Dialogue process and the Group of 15 forum.\r\nWe believe that through such efforts we and our\r\npartners in Africa can learn from our varied experiences in\r\ngovernance and socio-economic development. Through this\r\nprocess we can promote a greater and deepening sense of\r\nempathy and fraternity among leaders in both government\r\nand the private sector in the South. Malaysia’s relationship\r\nwith the African continent is part of our long-term\r\ncommitment to working together on the basis of shared\r\ninterests and mutual respect. We fully recognize and believe\r\nin the enormous potential of Africa.\r\nThe international community has a responsibility to\r\nmaintain a strong interest in and commitment to Africa. We\r\nmust work together with renewed vigour and in a spirit of\r\npartnership. Despite the difficulties and obstacles, the quest\r\nfor lasting peace and security must be relentlessly pursued\r\nin the African continent. There is an urgent need to\r\nimplement the important decisions relevant to Africa that\r\nhave been made in various United Nations organs and\r\nconferences. My delegation pledges Malaysia’s continued\r\ncommitment to working for peace and development in\r\nAfrica in the spirit of South-South cooperation and in\r\nsolidarity with the people of Africa.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (interpretation from French): Less\r\nthan six months ago the Secretary-General submitted a very\r\nrich report that, for the first time, clearly and lucidly\r\nanalysed the long-standing and new problems affecting\r\nAfrica, their underlying causes, and ways and means of\r\ntackling them. It was in fact at the request of the Security\r\nCouncil — which met at the ministerial level last year to\r\nconsider the desirability of concerted international action\r\nto promote international peace and security in Africa,\r\nwhich attested to the growing interest of the United\r\nNations in the stability and economic and social\r\ndevelopment of Africa — that the Secretary-General\r\nundertook to prepare that comprehensive and thorough\r\nreport on the state of a continent with which he has\r\nparticularly close ties, as he is himself a distinguished son\r\nof Africa. We are convinced that his report will help the\r\ninternational community better to understand Africa and\r\nbetter to gauge its ambitions and aspirations, and thus to\r\nrespond to its expectations. Now that the report is before\r\nthe General Assembly, it is important that the Assembly\r\ngive it the time and attention needed for serious, thorough\r\nconsideration, in particular of the portions of the report\r\nthat relate to it specifically.\r\nBefore turning to a few specific aspects of the\r\nreport, I should like, as I did before the Security Council,\r\nto recall a number of historical facts. While it is true that\r\nAfrica now faces problems that are both serious and\r\ncomplex, it is also true that it is a continent that possesses\r\nhope and a future, that has committed itself to the path of\r\nrecovery, and that, provided that it can find and be given\r\nthe means, will be able to tackle the challenges before it.\r\nWhile it is a continent beset by fratricidal\r\nconflicts — in which it is not unique — whose causes\r\nand origins the Secretary-General has lucidly analysed,\r\ndid it not immediately following independence try to\r\nprevent territorial disputes by endorsing the borders it had\r\ninherited from the colonial period? Did it not take charge,\r\nbetter than any other region, of dealing with conflict by\r\nsetting up the Central Organ of the Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, whose\r\nassistance is in constant demand and whose usefulness\r\nhas been amply confirmed?\r\nIs it not true that the sources of these conflicts date\r\nback to that bleak period of African history when, having\r\naroused the greed of the Powers of the day, Africa was\r\nsliced up and vivisected to satisfy colonial appetites, its\r\nborders arbitrarily drawn, its populations divided and\r\nscattered, and the age-old balance that had always\r\nsustained it brutally and irretrievably smashed? Is it not\r\nnow suffering the consequences of this dismemberment\r\nand paying the price for the divide-and-rule policy of the\r\ncolonial Powers — which, stoking and fuelling clan, tribal\r\nand regional rivalries, disrupted the building of national\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\ncohesion and paved the way for the tribalism and clan\r\nmentality that now seriously afflict Africa?\r\nLikewise, even if underdevelopment, disease and\r\npoverty are rife, has Africa not committed itself to the bold\r\nand ambitious undertaking of consolidating democracy and\r\nthe rule of law, which has already yielded promising\r\nresults, and of reforming, restoring and restructuring the\r\neconomy, which in many cases is marked by new growth,\r\nalthough at an unsustainable cost in social terms?\r\nIf Africa lags so far behind, that is because it had to\r\nstart with virtually nothing: during the colonial period it\r\nwas, at the worst, nothing more than a reservoir of natural\r\nresources ripe for plundering and of laughably cheap labour\r\nto be exploited and, if necessary, to be killed for unknown\r\nreasons, and, at the best, an immense territory in which\r\norder and security had to be maintained, and in which it\r\nwas therefore not absolutely necessary — despite all the\r\nmoralizing speeches — to build the infrastructure, hospitals,\r\nschools and factories that were desperately needed by the\r\npeople who in those days were called “the natives”. When\r\nAfrica regained its independence and vowed to rely on its\r\nown strength to create the right conditions for recovery, it\r\nwas obliged to do this in the worst possible conditions: it\r\nhad to fit in to an international order based on relations of\r\ndomination and marked by inequity in opportunities and\r\niniquity in trade.\r\nFinally, in what is by no means the least of its efforts,\r\nAfrica provided itself with an organization whose credo is\r\nunity, and an economic community whose goal is the\r\nintegration of all its economies. What more vivid proof\r\ncould there be of the progressive and irreversible realization\r\nof this great plan for unity than the fact that so many\r\nAfrican countries, as a first step towards the unification of\r\nthe continent, have joined together at the regional level in\r\npolitical and economic groupings in order to better pool\r\ntheir efforts and to take advantage of their\r\ncomplementarity?\r\nThe greatest challenge Africa must face today is\r\nobviously underdevelopment, along with everything it\r\nimplies. How to take up that challenge is clear: Africa must\r\nbe supported in its recovery efforts. That means that the\r\ninternational community should go beyond the initiatives it\r\nhas already undertaken and the efforts to which it has\r\nagreed — the results of which have clearly not matched the\r\nhopes invested in them. The results of United Nations\r\naction in this regard — whether through the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s or\r\nthe United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on\r\nAfrica — have been limited because the funds allocated\r\nhave never reached the desired levels, because official\r\nassistance has targeted sectors that have no real impact on\r\ndevelopment, because programmes have been designed\r\nwithout consulting the parties concerned — which is to\r\nsay, Africans — and, finally, because they were executed\r\nin an unsuitable domestic and international environment.\r\nWith regard to experiences in international\r\ncooperation and development assistance in Africa, in\r\nmany cases — although not all — these have been mere\r\npretences rather than expressions of genuine desire to\r\nassist Africa in starting its recovery. Still worse, they\r\nhave at times merely served to deepen Africa’s\r\ndependence and exacerbated its marginalization.\r\nThe General Assembly, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the Bretton Woods institutions are jointly\r\ncalled on today to contribute to the thinking process on\r\nthe methods to be used to help Africa achieve recovery.\r\nWithout genuine mobilization on the part of the financial\r\ninstitutions and United Nations agencies centred on a\r\nwide-ranging and ambitious programme of support for\r\nAfrica that coherently and comprehensively addresses the\r\nquestions of investment, development assistance, external\r\ndebt, trade and the negative effects of structural\r\nadjustment policies, any policy targeting Africa will be\r\ndoomed to failure and will be a hollow gesture.\r\nThe other problem Africa is facing with the same\r\nfaith and determination is the proliferation of conflicts on\r\nits soil. In this respect, it seems to us vital for the United\r\nNations to strengthen its cooperation with the\r\nOrganization of African Unity in handling these conflicts,\r\nas that organization knows and understands their causes\r\nbetter than any other body. The Central Organ of the\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution is in this regard a valuable tool which should\r\nbe fully utilized. In addition, the international community\r\nhas a duty to demonstrate solidarity with and assume its\r\nunshirkable responsibilities towards Africa.\r\nPreventive diplomacy is another aspect related to the\r\nhandling of conflicts. Like peacekeeping operations and\r\nthe delivery of humanitarian assistance, it should be\r\nsubject to the consent of the State concerned and depend,\r\ntherefore, on its cooperation.\r\nRespect for the sovereignty of States and the need to\r\nhave their consent are all the more important because of\r\nthe susceptibility of humanitarian assistance to\r\nexploitation for political purposes. Such assistance has\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nsometimes been diverted in ways that have gravely\r\nundermined it both in principle and in the field.\r\nFurthermore, it seems to us essential to keep in mind that\r\nhumanitarian assistance cannot and should not represent an\r\nalternative to preventing or settling conflicts any more than\r\nit should be a way of salving one’s conscience or an excuse\r\nfor inaction.\r\nLastly, I should like to comment on the question of\r\nthe proliferation of weapons. In this regard, Algeria is\r\ncompelled to note its interest in the proposal to reduce arms\r\nand munitions expenditures to 1.5 per cent of gross\r\ndomestic product. Likewise, we can only welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal regarding compiling, tracking\r\nand publicizing of information on arms traffic, which fuels\r\nlarge-scale crime and terrorism. If this undertaking is to be\r\neffective it should be handled by the Department for\r\nDisarmament Affairs and be part of resolute and relentless\r\ninternational cooperation designed to break up the arms-\r\nsupply networks that support terrorist groups in their\r\nundertakings of destruction and death.\r\nThe Secretary-General has given us a report filled with\r\nideas and recommendations that must now be translated into\r\nactions. By creating a Working Group to implement the\r\nrecommendations within its purview, the Security Council\r\ndemonstrated the serious approach it intends to take in\r\nhandling African issues and the determination that inspires\r\nit. The Assembly can do no less than the Council. It, too,\r\nmust implement and follow up the recommendations that\r\nfall within its area of competence. It has the will to do so;\r\nit should equip itself with the means.\r\nMr. Shervani (India): May I compliment the\r\nSecretary-General for undertaking a thorough and\r\ncomprehensive review of the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica in his report (A/52/871), which was submitted to the\r\nSecurity Council in April this year as document\r\nS/1998/318. The report has succinctly brought out the\r\ncomplex interplay of factors, forces and events that have\r\nhad an important bearing on developments in Africa this\r\ncentury. While acknowledging that there has been\r\nsignificant economic and political progress in recent years,\r\nthe report has noted that in many parts of the vast continent\r\nprogress remains threatened or impeded by conflict.\r\nAfrica holds a special place in our hearts. India and\r\nAfrica are inextricably and intimately bound by ties of\r\nhistory, with age-old commercial and civilizational links.\r\nWe have both been victims of disempowerment, deprivation\r\nand exploitation through the colonial experience. We are\r\njoined by our struggle for freedom. We both face\r\ngargantuan development challenges. What happens in\r\nAfrica is of abiding concern to us.\r\nThe Secretary-General has dwelt at some length on\r\nthe various factors that have contributed to the situation\r\nobtaining in parts of Africa. Most of Africa has suffered\r\nthe ravages of ruthless colonial exploitation. The\r\nconsequences have been compounded by challenges in\r\nnation-building, in development of economic capacities —\r\nparticularly in agriculture and small and medium-sized\r\nindustry — and in distributive disparities. However,\r\nAfrica’s situation is not unique. A number of countries\r\naround the globe have suffered from similar\r\ncircumstances and can identify with the challenges facing\r\nAfrica.\r\nWhat resurgent Africa did not receive, as devastated\r\nEurope did, was an infusion of resources matching its\r\nneeds. Its development has been stymied by a paucity of\r\nfinancial resources. Development assistance and value-\r\nadded exports, the engines of economic recovery,\r\nrepresent but a trickle in that vast continent. The question\r\nof sustained development is central to the problems faced\r\nby all developing countries, whether in Africa or\r\nelsewhere. The totality of this challenge needs to be\r\naddressed comprehensively, effectively and urgently. It is\r\norgans such as the General Assembly, as well as the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, that can address it in a\r\nsustained and meaningful manner in all its elements.\r\nAfrica is not, and must not be seen as, inherently\r\nunstable and riven by conflict. The efforts of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and other\r\nsubregional organizations to broker peace and\r\nmeaningfully address the root causes of conflicts are an\r\nencouraging development. The long-term objectives of\r\ndevelopment adopted by the OAU in the Lagos Plan of\r\nAction of April 1980 remain largely unfulfilled. A recent\r\nstudy by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)\r\nnoted that the emphasis on structural adjustment by the\r\ninternational financial institutions did not address the\r\nremoval of structural weaknesses in national capacities, in\r\nproduction and trade structures and in transport and rural\r\ninfrastructure, which produced macroeconomic\r\ndisequilibrium. Persuasive analysis has demonstrated that\r\ndecline or stagnation in parts of Africa has been caused\r\nby a combination of domestic pressures, external shocks\r\nand an artificial and extraneous adjustment model foisted\r\nupon them. It is against this background that we should\r\nconsider whether omnibus solutions, however well-\r\nmeaning, can be an answer to the real needs of Africa.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nGlobalization has brought in its wake manifold\r\nproblems, especially in developing countries. A greater\r\nreliance on market forces and a reduction in the scope of\r\ngovernance has weakened the State as an institution,\r\nresulting in social and economic pressures on large sections\r\nof society. While this may not be a permanent condition,\r\nGovernments must have the funds to pay for social support\r\nsystems in this transitional phase. Failure to do so invites\r\naggravated tensions and an undermining of fragile\r\ndemocratic structures. That countries in transition need\r\nmassive financial support to pre-empt pressures and to\r\nsecure democracy has been recognized in Eastern Europe;\r\nit is unfortunate that Africa, which, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s analysis points out, is in a comparable situation,\r\ndoes not receive anywhere near the same support.\r\nThe Secretary-General has made several important and\r\nfar-reaching suggestions in the section on humanitarian\r\nassistance. We would like to reiterate our serious concern\r\nover the significant decline in levels of funding for\r\nhumanitarian assistance, both in absolute terms and as a\r\nproportion of programme requirements. The perception that\r\nthis decline could be related to the political significance of\r\ncrises or levels of media interest needs to be corrected. That\r\nthis decline has been mostly felt in respect of consolidated\r\nappeals for countries of the African continent is a matter\r\nthat deserves our priority attention. We therefore strongly\r\nsupport the earlier proposals of the Secretary-General to\r\nundertake a comprehensive review of the funding of\r\nhumanitarian programmes, including, inter alia, the\r\nrelationship between funding provided for emergencies and\r\nresources made available for development programming.\r\nWe hope that the consolidated reports by the Humanitarian\r\nAffairs Coordinator on implications of underfunding,\r\nincluding forced changes in priorities and cancellation of\r\nactivities, will be an important first step in ensuring that\r\nadequate assistance is available to those in need.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize the central need for\r\ngenerating economic growth in Africa. The elements of\r\neffective, transparent and accountable governance,\r\nresponsive to the needs and priorities of the governed, are\r\nbeing put in place, as are decentralization and the taking of\r\ndecisions at those levels where they have the greatest effect.\r\nWe see the process as an integral one, where improvements\r\nin one sphere positively contribute to the growth of another.\r\nRendering all assistance and investment secondary to the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights will of necessity\r\nfail in achieving the primary purpose, which is the\r\npromotion of widespread prosperity in larger freedom.\r\nFurthermore, it has been our consistent belief to\r\ndiscourage modes of thought that seek to portray civil\r\nsociety and non-governmental organizations in opposition\r\nto the Government. We would like to see them in a\r\ncollaborative and cooperative mode, building on the\r\ncomplementarities which exist between them for the\r\nbenefit of the people of Africa.\r\nWe fully support the view of the Secretary-General,\r\nas expressed in paragraph 80 of document A/52/871, that\r\nwithout growth there can be no sustained increase in\r\nhousehold or government spending, in private or public\r\ncapital formation, in health or social welfare. After all,\r\ndistributive justice cannot imply distribution of poverty,\r\njust as sustainable development cannot mean sustenance\r\nof poverty and deprivation. In this regard, we favour the\r\nemphasis placed by the Secretary-General on export led\r\ngrowth. But we are constrained to point out that rising\r\nlevels of protectionism in developed country markets, the\r\nfrequent and unjustified use of anti-dumping duties and\r\ncountervailing measures, and tariff escalation and tariff\r\npeaks tend to negate the comparative advantages of\r\ndeveloping countries and the competitive advantage of\r\ntheir enterprises. The international community would need\r\nto act in concert to ensure that market access to products\r\nand manufactured goods from Africa is available as an\r\nintegrated element of a benign cycle we wish to see set in\r\nmotion.\r\nAfrica’s problems deserve special attention. The\r\nSecretary-General has focused on the issues at hand\r\ncandidly and in some detail and has also suggested\r\nremedial action. In this regard, Prime Minister Vajpayee,\r\nwhile addressing the Non-Aligned Movement’s summit in\r\nDurban last month, asked the Movement to examine the\r\nusefulness of an international conference or a special\r\nsession of the General Assembly to focus on the special\r\nneeds of Africa. I reiterate this suggestion for the\r\nconsideration by the Assembly.\r\nIn this twentieth anniversary year of the Buenos\r\nAires Plan of Action, the Government of India wishes to\r\nreaffirm its commitment to constructive and productive\r\nSouth-South cooperation, especially with Africa. To date,\r\napproximately 20,000 foreign participants have been\r\ntrained in India under the Indian Technical and Economic\r\nCooperation Programme. The Programme now extends to\r\nover 110 countries, encompassing areas such as\r\ninformatics, biotechnology, conventional and non-\r\nconventional energy sources, agriculture, small-scale\r\nindustry, telecommunications, natural-disaster prevention,\r\nrelief and rehabilitation, and others. Several countries in\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nAfrica have been our valued partners in the promotion of\r\nthis cooperation. Agreements on cooperation have also been\r\nconcluded with regional bodies such as the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community. We propose to continue\r\nfurther in this direction, expanding both the scope and the\r\ncoverage of our cooperation with them.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): It is an honour for me to\r\ntake part at an early stage in the discussion of an issue\r\nwhich is so important for the future of Africa.\r\nI think we should commend the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive report on this agenda item and his\r\ncontinued efforts to accelerate the settlement of conflicts in\r\nthis part of the world and to promote peace and\r\ndevelopment on the African continent.\r\nThis is the third time during the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that the situation in Africa is being\r\nconsidered in the main United Nations bodies. In our view,\r\nthis is yet more convincing evidence that the United\r\nNations continues to attach great importance to the\r\nproblems of Africa.\r\nToday Africa has reached a very important stage in its\r\ndevelopment. For almost a decade now, many African\r\ncountries have been making courageous efforts to build\r\nmore open societies in which the exercise of political power\r\nwould rest on democratic values. In some countries of the\r\nregion the economy has started to emerge from the abyss,\r\nand the people there seem to have realized the importance\r\nof gaining strength through unity. Through the efforts of\r\nindividual countries, the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and other regional organizations, some of the hot\r\nspots and conflicts on the continent have been eliminated or\r\neased.\r\nAt the same time, there are still persistent problems\r\nwhich continue to impact negatively the situation in many\r\nAfrican countries. As a whole, Africa remains marginalized\r\nin the present system of international economic relations.\r\nAs a result, the situation in most of the continent is still\r\ncharacterized by striking poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nTherefore, we as United Nations Member States should not\r\nbe indifferent observers.\r\nOne cannot be indifferent either to the fact, for\r\nexample, that nearly a third of the 42 countries of the sub-\r\nSaharan region are engaged in conflicts or civil wars. In\r\nsome of them, the vast movements of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons continue to be an alarming factor that\r\ncontributes to the internal instability.\r\nTherefore, we strongly believe that the issues of\r\npeace, security and stability and the problems of\r\nsustainable economic development of Africa should be\r\naddressed simultaneously, as they are closely interrelated.\r\nThe United Nations should be ready to meet these\r\nchallenges through its peacekeeping operations, good-\r\noffices missions, and the emergency relief programmes.\r\nAt the same time, broader international efforts, such as\r\nthe imposition of sanctions, can succeed only if they are\r\ncomplemented by genuine cooperation and support on the\r\npart of all countries of the region.\r\nIn our view, the leading role in ensuring such\r\ncooperation should continue to be played by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity. It is also imperative that\r\nthe international community enhance its political, material\r\nand technical support to the OAU in order to improve its\r\ncapabilities for resolving conflict situations within the\r\nAfrican framework.\r\nIn past years we have witnessed positive examples\r\nof preventive and peacekeeping efforts undertaken by\r\nsubregional organizations in southern Africa, West Africa\r\nand the Horn of Africa. Therefore, we support the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/52/871) to improve\r\ncoordination and the exchange of information between the\r\nUnited Nations and these organizations.\r\nFrom the very first days of its regained\r\nindependence, Ukraine has developed cooperation with\r\nAfrica on the basis of promoting a mutually beneficial\r\npartnership, keeping in view the long-standing traditions\r\nand history of its relations with many countries of this\r\ncontinent. The participation of Ukrainian units and\r\nobservers, as well as Ukrainian transport aircraft, in a\r\nnumber of United Nations peacekeeping operations in\r\nAfrica is yet further proof of our keen interest in further\r\ndeveloping these relations. We are only at the initial stage\r\nof this promising cooperation, and I take this opportunity\r\nto encourage interested African States to join us in this\r\nundertaking.\r\nIt is our sincere hope that Africa will eventually\r\novercome the difficulties it is facing today, and that the\r\ncontinent will turn into a region of political stability and\r\nsteady social and economic progress. It is not an easy\r\ntask, but it is our common obligation to help Africa in\r\nachieving this goal.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Bangladesh\r\nparticipates in this debate in the General Assembly with a\r\ngreat sense of pride and commitment: pride because of the\r\nindomitable spirit of the African people, which has always\r\nenergized us; commitment because we believe in the cause\r\nof peace and development in Africa.\r\nIt is from this perspective that Bangladesh\r\nwholeheartedly welcomes the report (A/52/871) of the\r\nSecretary-General, on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica. We note with particular appreciation the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s outlining of some initiatives to be pursued both\r\nwithin Africa and by the international community with a\r\nview to eliminating the roots of conflict through a variety\r\nof sustained economic and social measures. We also\r\nwelcome warmly the statement made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral at the outset of this debate this morning.\r\nBangladesh welcomed last April the Security Council\r\npronouncement that a comprehensive response to Africa’s\r\ncomplex and interrelated security and development\r\nchallenges was needed, and its urging the General\r\nAssembly, along with other United Nations bodies, regional\r\norganizations, international financial institutions and\r\nMember States, to consider the recommendations of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and take appropriate action\r\nof their own. It was important for Bangladesh to take part\r\nin the Security Council’s deliberations on that occasion. We\r\nare happy that a second ministerial meeting of the Council\r\non the situation in Africa took place on 24 September. We\r\nare also pleased to join the call made by the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement summit in Durban for the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations in the Secretary-General’s report. We\r\nstrongly believe that these recommendations can give a new\r\nmomentum to peace and development in Africa.\r\nWe fully share the view expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the prevention of conflict begins and ends with\r\nthe promotion of human security and human development.\r\nAs in other places, conflicts in Africa have their roots in\r\nsocial discrimination, economic deprivation and lack of\r\naccountability in the use of political power. At the same\r\ntime, we believe that the colonial legacy and its\r\ncontinuation in different forms and manifestations still\r\nprevent social and political assimilation and the equitable\r\ndistribution of resources, thus fomenting tensions and\r\nconflicts within and among nations. There is little\r\njustification for lamenting the human and material loss in\r\nconflicts in Africa and elsewhere when political divisions\r\nin every society are feeding today’s violence.\r\nWe find useful the suggestions in part III of the\r\nreport for addressing the threats to peace and security in\r\nAfrica. In particular, the Secretary-General’s emphasis on\r\nthe need to seek political solutions to disputes through\r\nutilizing the resources of the regional organizations, like\r\nthe Organization of African Unity, under the direction of\r\nthe United Nations, is worth considering.\r\nViolations of humanitarian law and the sanctity of\r\nhuman persons, particularly the abuses of the rights of\r\nwomen and children during conflicts is a major problem,\r\nand we are happy to see the attention paid to these\r\naspects by the Secretary-General in his report. We would\r\nlike to commend him for the appointment of a Special\r\nRepresentative on the impact of armed conflict on\r\nchildren, with a view to maintaining a sustained focus on\r\nthis issue. We fully support the idea of making children\r\na zone of peace during any conflict.\r\nRegarding human rights abuses in conflict situations,\r\nwe note the Secretary-General’s proposal to fund all\r\nspecial human rights missions from the assessed\r\ncontributions of the Organization. We support the idea\r\nthat the rights of all civilians, including relief workers in\r\nsituations of armed conflict, should be respected and\r\nprotected.\r\nA fair degree of consensus exists these days on the\r\nidea that Governments should be politically accountable\r\nand socially responsible, as well as pro-people, based on\r\nthe rule of law and respect for the dignity of human\r\npersons. In this context, we find merit in the suggestions\r\non various aspects of good governance made by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report.\r\nDevelopment is indeed a human right, and it is\r\ncentral to the prospects of reducing conflict in Africa. We\r\nbelieve that lack of development is the source of all\r\nconflict in Africa, and therefore the international\r\ncommunity needs to encourage African countries to focus\r\non development, with particular emphasis on investing in\r\nthe social sector. As the Secretary-General has said,\r\ninvestment in human resources must be recognized not\r\nmerely as a by-product of economic growth, but also as\r\na driving force for development. It is also an essential\r\ncomponent in eliminating poverty, which feeds all\r\ndiscontent, and hatred. As my colleague from Zimbabwe\r\nsaid in the Security Council debate, “the seed of\r\ndemocracy cannot germinate, let alone thrive, in the soil\r\nof mass poverty, illiteracy, hunger and disease”.\r\n(S/PV.3875, p. 32)\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nHere we believe that investment in the education of\r\ngirls has a most effective return. Indeed, in Bangladesh we\r\nhave seen how investment in women’s and girls’ education\r\nand empowerment, through an elaborate network of micro-\r\ncredit and other support programmes, has transformed them\r\ninto socially productive resources. We welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation that aid in Africa\r\nshould be restructured to focus on high-impact areas and to\r\nreduce dependency.\r\nNo domestic efforts can be successful in the\r\ndeveloping countries, in Africa in particular, unless these\r\nare matched by equally robust and positive international\r\nsupport. In this context, my delegation fully supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s call for at least 50 per cent of donors’\r\naid to Africa to be spent there — in Africa. Likewise, we\r\nendorse the Secretary-General’s call to all bilateral creditors\r\nto convert into grants all their remaining bilateral debt to\r\nthe poorest African countries. We also support his call to\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions to provide peace-friendly\r\nstructural adjustment programmes.\r\nIn addition to debt support and capacity-building,\r\nmarket access to products from the less developed African\r\ncountries is also important. In this connection, we support\r\nthe idea of enhanced and guaranteed access to developed\r\ncountry markets, as well as improved regional South-South\r\ncooperation. Indeed, relatively advanced neighbouring\r\ncountries could consider providing market access to\r\nproducts from the African least developed countries on a\r\nnon-reciprocal basis.\r\nRegional and subregional integration can also help\r\novercome single-country handicaps in economic activities.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s suggestions in this regard deserve\r\nserious consideration.\r\nBangladesh’s commitment to the well-being of our\r\nbrothers and sisters in Africa is rooted in a number of\r\ncompelling factors. Bangladesh has been a major\r\ncontributor to almost all peacekeeping and peacemaking\r\nefforts of the United Nations on the African continent. We\r\nhave together pursued similar lines of struggle for our\r\nindependence, and we still share similar values of life and\r\noutlook on the contemporary global situation.\r\nOn the economic front, most of the African countries\r\nare members of the group known as the least developed\r\ncountries, of which Bangladesh has the honour to serve as\r\ncoordinator. We therefore share common experiences and\r\ncommon goals in our struggle to foster a stable social order,\r\neconomic emancipation and political freedom in order to\r\nmake life meaningful to our peoples.\r\nLet me reaffirm our commitment to see a conflict-\r\nfree Africa contributing to global peace, security and\r\ndevelopment in a meaningful way.\r\nMr. Shen Guofang (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): First of all, on behalf of the Chinese delegation,\r\nplease allow me to extend our thanks to Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for the comprehensive report on Africa that\r\nhe has submitted to the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council. The report has played an important role\r\nin focusing the attention of the international community\r\non Africa. Two Security Council meetings on the report\r\nwere convened at Foreign Minister level, and some\r\nfollow-up actions have been taken. We support an in-\r\ndepth and comprehensive review of the report by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn the post-cold-war era, the aspiration for peace and\r\nstability and the pursuit of development and cooperation\r\nhave become the main trend on the African continent.\r\nRecently, however, the spate of regional conflicts in\r\ncertain parts of Africa has affected the unity, stability,\r\nsecurity and development of the regions and countries\r\nconcerned and has aroused the concern and attention of\r\nthe international community.\r\nAfrica is vast in area and rich in resources. The\r\nAfrican people have made tremendous contributions to the\r\nadvancement of human civilization. Making up one third\r\nof the United Nations membership, the African countries\r\nrepresent an important political force to be reckoned with.\r\nWithout stability in Africa, there will be no global peace.\r\nWithout the development of Africa, world prosperity will\r\nnot be possible. Therefore, we must look at Africa from\r\nthe strategic heights of global peace and development, pay\r\nreal attention to its stability and treat it as an equal\r\npartner for development.\r\nThe conflicts in Africa, which can be traced back to\r\ndeep historical roots, are at the same time set in complex\r\npresent-day realities. To resolve the conflicts and maintain\r\nstability on the continent is an important and arduous task\r\nfor the United Nations. In this connection, we believe that\r\nthe following two points are crucial.\r\nFirst, the prerequisite and starting point for settling\r\nAfrican conflicts is respect for the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of African countries and abstention\r\nfrom interfering in their internal affairs. We hold that all\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nconflicts and disputes should be settled through peaceful\r\nmeans.\r\nWe have taken note that the recent tireless efforts\r\nmade by some African countries and regional organizations\r\nhave facilitated the settlement of regional conflicts and have\r\nproduced tangible results. We believe that the United\r\nNations should increase its involvement and input in Africa,\r\nplay a constructive role as coordinator in settling African\r\nconflicts, and, in tandem with regional efforts, provide\r\nnecessary and timely assistance to African countries to meet\r\ntheir legitimate and reasonable requests.\r\nSecondly, attention should be given to taking steps to\r\nhelp promote development in Africa. Peace and\r\ndevelopment rely on and supplement each other and are\r\nmutually reinforcing. The promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the African economy will help resolve\r\nAfrican conflicts and at the same time realize lasting peace\r\nin Africa.\r\nThe African economy has been looking up in recent\r\nyears, but the overall reality remains grim. Goals laid down\r\nin the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) are still far from being\r\nrealized. Despite their multifarious efforts, African countries\r\nare still facing the danger of being marginalized in the\r\nglobalization process. Africa still has a long way to go to\r\nachieve its development.\r\nThe international community, especially the developed\r\ncountries, should carry out its commitments in real earnest\r\nwith regard to funds, debts, markets and goods, and create\r\na favourable external environment for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe support the proposals made in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report for reducing the debt burden of African\r\ncountries, opening markets wider to them and helping\r\nAfrica strengthen regional cooperation. We hope that the\r\norganizations concerned will, on the basis of a good\r\nunderstanding and knowledge of Africa, work out a feasible\r\nand specific programme that suits the national conditions of\r\nAfrican countries. We hope that these two points will be\r\ngiven due attention.\r\nChina has always cherished its traditional friendship\r\nwith the people of Africa and therefore attaches great\r\nimportance to strengthening its cooperation with the\r\ncontinent in various fields. We have always supported\r\nAfrican countries in their efforts to resolve conflicts and\r\nestablish lasting peace and have always respected their\r\nchoice of political system and path of development\r\nadapted to their national conditions. We will strive to\r\ncontribute even further to Africa’s development by\r\ncontinuing to support the efforts of its countries to\r\ndevelop their national economies and will continue to\r\noffer assistance within our capacity, without attaching any\r\npolitical conditions.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I should like at the outset to express my\r\ncountry’s satisfaction with the efforts of the United\r\nNations, and in particular of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan, to draw serious attention to the dangers of the\r\nconflicts raging in Africa. We support his most recent\r\napproach to highlight these problems and to formulate\r\nappropriate solutions to them on a firm and lasting basis.\r\nThis approach has resulted in the Security Council’s\r\ndischarging its main responsibilities for these conflicts,\r\nwhich threaten international peace and security. As a\r\npreliminary attempt to help the peoples of Africa to cope\r\nwith these tragedies and to evaluate the progress made\r\ntowards establishing peace and security on the continent,\r\nit has convened two ministerial meetings in two years to\r\nstudy the causes of conflict in Africa in a transparent and\r\nopen manner. In this respect, Kuwait declares its support\r\nfor the most recent presidential statement of the Council,\r\nissued at its 3931st meeting on 24 September 1998.\r\nKuwait fully endorses the recommendations and\r\nother contents of the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa. We associate ourselves\r\nwith his analysis of the causes of conflict in Africa. In his\r\nreport, the Secretary-General points to several factors\r\nwhich are at play in this regard, inter alia, the legacy of\r\ncolonialism, external intervention and economic\r\nfeebleness.\r\nKuwait believes, however, that, in the final analysis,\r\nthe primary responsibility falls to all those who have\r\nallowed the residual conflicts to expand and escalate, thus\r\nigniting ethnic and tribal hatreds that have ultimately\r\nencouraged external elements to interfere in the internal\r\naffairs of the African countries. They did so not to\r\naccomplish a specific development objective, but to\r\nreceive military support and impose their domination of\r\nAfrica’s economies without concern for the rights of\r\npeoples to enjoy their own natural resources and\r\npotentialities in an organized and equitable manner. This\r\nhad led to the emergence of all the ills which the friendly\r\ncountries of Africa are seeing today — military conflicts,\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\ncivil or ethnic wars, and innumerable economic and social\r\nproblems. All of these issues are the clear results of a lack\r\nof concentration, from the outset, on the objective of\r\ndevelopment. This has led to bloody violence, which has\r\nconsumed the material and human resources that have\r\ncharacterized a vibrant Africa.\r\nKuwait is following with great concern the conflicts\r\nraging in Africa, a continent linked to Kuwait and its\r\npeople by ties of particular friendship. We feel great respect\r\nand appreciation for the African peoples. Kuwait,\r\nalternating with Burkina Faso, leads the Committee for\r\nArab-African dialogue, the objective of which is to ensure\r\ncooperation in all areas between African and Arab\r\ncountries. Kuwait also leads the Committee of Sahelian\r\nStates to combat desertification and drought and has\r\ncommitted $30 million to it.\r\nOn the basis of this friendship, Kuwait has sought to\r\nprovide development assistance to the peoples of Africa in\r\norder to alleviate their sufferings. For example, the Kuwait\r\nFund for Arab Economic Development, founded in 1962,\r\nhas to date provided credits on preferential conditions to 33\r\nAfrican countries, which received 142 loans worth\r\n$1,000,560,499. It has also sent 42 technical assistance\r\nmissions to 25 African States, at a cost of $25 million. The\r\nFund’s recent report states that, in 1997, $10 million was\r\nprovided in the form of grants and technical assistance to\r\nthe countries of eastern, southern and central Africa, and\r\ngrants totalling approximately $11 million to those of\r\nwestern Africa. Kuwait has also continued its development\r\nsupport of the African countries through charitable Kuwaiti\r\norganizations, a unique role which has been appreciated by\r\nthe African peoples benefiting from it. Foremost among\r\nthese organizations is the Africa Muslims Agency, which\r\nstarted off in 1981 by granting assistance and generous\r\nsupport to African countries.\r\nKuwait is aware of the importance of the African\r\nStates providing all appropriate conditions which would\r\nconvince donor and friendly countries of the necessity of\r\ncontinuing to provide all types of assistance needed in the\r\ndevelopment field. The African States are aware of the\r\nimportance of the concept of sustainable development\r\nprimarily through their getting rid of the spectre of war,\r\nbloody conflicts and violence, which not only drain Africa’s\r\nhuman resources, but also scare off foreign investors who\r\nwould like to participate in the activation of the\r\ndevelopment process in Africa in a sincere manner. Thus,\r\nthe human element and material assistance are the nucleus\r\nof success for sustainable development plans throughout the\r\nworld, particularly in Africa.\r\nFinally, I would like to say that there can be no\r\ndevelopment without peace and stability. The expectations\r\nregarding development require political will, regional\r\nintegration and cooperation among the African countries\r\nto ensure the development of that continent.\r\nMr. Lee See-Young (Republic of Korea): My\r\ndelegation has examined with great interest and\r\nappreciation the report of the Secretary-General contained\r\nin document A/52/871. We concur with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his analysis of the fundamental causes of\r\nconflict in Africa. We also endorse his comprehensive\r\nrecommendations on conflict resolution and the promotion\r\nof sustainable development in Africa. As he pointed out,\r\nthe problems now facing Africa represent the immediate\r\nchallenges the entire international community must\r\naddress with a sense of urgency. The solutions to these\r\nproblems require the mobilization of the collective\r\npolitical will of all nations. I hope that today’s debate on\r\nAfrica will give us an opportunity to create a blueprint for\r\nhow the international community can best help Africa\r\nachieve peace and development.\r\nSince the 1970s, the Government of the Republic of\r\nKorea has given high priority to the promotion of\r\ncooperative relations with African countries in the spirit\r\nof South-South cooperation and solidarity with the people\r\nof Africa. My Government has continuously expanded its\r\nofficial development assistance to Africa. More recently,\r\nit has participated in a number of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in Africa, including United\r\nNations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II), United\r\nNations Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III)\r\nand the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in\r\nWestern Sahara (MINURSO). Our attachment to the issue\r\nof Africa became even greater during our recent two-year\r\ninvolvement as a member of the Security Council.\r\nAllow me to make comments on several points\r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General. My first\r\nconcerns conflict prevention and rapid response to\r\nconflicts. We agree that there is an urgent need to\r\nstrengthen efforts to prevent conflicts through early-\r\nwarning and preventive action. We welcomed the\r\nestablishment of the trust fund for preventive action of the\r\nSecretary-General and will continue to make contributions\r\nto the fund. We hope that contributions to the fund will\r\nincrease so as to enable the Secretary-General to expand\r\nhis initiatives to prevent potential conflicts, particularly in\r\nAfrica.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nMy delegation also believes that rapid response to\r\nconflicts is crucial to containing the intensity of conflicts\r\nand alleviating human suffering. One of the most effective\r\nways to reach that end is to build and enhance the\r\npeacekeeping capacities of Africa itself. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the recent move by the United Nations to\r\ncultivate closer ties with regional and subregional\r\norganizations, such as the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS).\r\nWe wish to take note of the Security Council\r\npresidential statement of 16 September 1998, which\r\nprovides for the ways and means to improve training and\r\nexchange of information for African peacekeeping capacity-\r\nbuilding. However, the crucial question remains of how to\r\nprovide logistical support to African troops in the early\r\nstages of conflicts. We consider it necessary to examine the\r\npossibility of establishing a stand-by arrangement for such\r\nlogistical support.\r\nSecondly, there is also an urgent need to alleviate\r\nhuman suffering in protracted conflicts, which are rampant\r\nin some parts of Africa. Particular attention should be paid\r\nto the need for protection for humanitarian assistance in\r\nconflict situations. Unfortunately, the security and safety of\r\nhumanitarian workers are increasingly threatened by\r\nnumerous acts in violation of international humanitarian law\r\nand by the spread of the culture of impunity. In this\r\nconnection, my delegation strongly endorses the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nfollow-up report on this issue to the Security Council last\r\nmonth. We believe that the General Assembly should also\r\nlook into the report since it touches upon a number of\r\nissues within the Assembly’s mandate. We sincerely hope\r\nthat the Secretary-General’s recommendations will be\r\ntranslated into concrete action through close collaboration\r\namong the relevant organs and agencies of the United\r\nNations.\r\nFurthermore, it is essential to ensure the security and\r\nneutrality of refugee camps. Serious thought should be\r\ngiven to how to separate combatants from bona fide\r\nrefugees and displaced persons. We believe that necessary\r\nmeasures can be taken in a manner proportionate to the\r\nintensity of conflict. In this regard, we support the concept\r\nof a “ladder of options” proposed by Mrs. Sadako Ogata,\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, at the\r\nSecurity Council meeting on 24 April this year.\r\nThird, my delegation believes that the international\r\ncommunity should make every effort to halt the arms flow\r\ninto and within the African continent. We fully support\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1196 (1998) of last month to\r\nenhance the effectiveness of arms embargoes already in\r\nplace. It is equally important that the various\r\nrecommendations listed in the resolution be effectively\r\nimplemented. Furthermore, given the cross-border arms\r\nmovement, country-specific arms embargoes do not\r\nsuffice to stem the flow of arms. We therefore propose\r\nthat serious consideration be given to the establishment of\r\na regional or subregional regime to control the arms flow\r\nin Africa. Drawing on the experience of the situation in\r\nthe African Great Lakes region, we also suggest that\r\npractical ways be explored to control the movement of\r\narmed persons, such as militias and mercenaries.\r\nLast but not least, we share the Secretary-General’s\r\nemphasis on good governance and sustainable\r\ndevelopment as fundamentals for long-term peace and\r\nprosperity in Africa. According to our own experience,\r\ngood governance based on respect for democratic\r\nprinciples and human rights better ensures peace, stability\r\nand prosperity in the long run.\r\nAt the same time, we believe that the international\r\ncommunity should step up efforts to resolve the pressing\r\nissue of debt relief for African countries and further\r\nstrengthen development cooperation with the region,\r\nbearing in mind the five priority areas the Secretary-\r\nGeneral emphasized this morning.\r\nAs for my Government, our development\r\ncooperation policy will continue to focus on increased\r\nprovision of human resource development programmes\r\nand grants in the framework of official development\r\nassistance. Recognizing the urgent need to facilitate\r\nprivate sector development in Africa and to promote\r\nAsian-African interregional cooperation, we plan to host\r\nan Asia-Africa trade and investment forum towards the\r\nend of this year. We expect that this forum will contribute\r\nto encouraging increased trade and investment flows\r\nbetween the two continents.\r\nConflicts still persist in many parts of the world,\r\nincluding Africa. But the reality we face today is that if\r\nwe are to fulfil our responsibility for international peace\r\nand security, we should give priority to the African\r\ncontinent. World peace will not be complete without\r\npeace and sustained development in Africa. We hope,\r\ntherefore, that our debate on this issue, the first ever in\r\nthe General Assembly, will create a new momentum for\r\na more constructive and concerted action on the part of\r\nboth the African countries and the international\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\ncommunity. The Republic of Korea reiterates its continued\r\ncommitment to work for peace and development in Africa\r\nin the spirit of solidarity with the people of Africa.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAllow me at the outset to thank the Secretary-General, his\r\nassistants and all those who contributed to preparing the\r\nreport on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa\r\n(A/52/871). This report reflects without doubt the will of\r\nthe United Nations to absorb the lessons of the past, and it\r\nembodies an ambitious vision of the performance of the\r\nUnited Nations in Africa, as well as the political, economic\r\nand human issues that Africa will confront in the future, in\r\nline with the noble purposes of the United Nations as set\r\nforth in the Charter.\r\nThe report reflects the close linkage between the\r\ncauses of conflict in Africa, on the one hand, and the\r\neconomic and social crises that the continent is undergoing,\r\non the other. Africa is still suffering under the weight of\r\nchronic debts, as well as declining official development\r\nassistance and the increasing conditionality associated with\r\nit. Africa is also suffering from the approach of selectivity\r\nof the world’s capital flows, which is not often based on\r\nobjective economic criteria. This is coupled with a\r\ndeteriorating economic and social situation in many African\r\ncountries which results from disease and poverty and their\r\nattendant economic and social upheavals. Yet our\r\naspirations for the African continent surpass by far the\r\nefforts being made at present at the international level to\r\nhelp the countries of the continent, especially the least\r\ndeveloped.\r\nIn this respect, we wish to reiterate the importance of\r\nthe General Assembly’s role in sensitizing international\r\norganizations and economic and financial institutions with\r\nregard to Africa’s problems, and in urging them to provide\r\nthe resources needed to help Africa develop its economy\r\nand to direct greater attention towards African problems.\r\nEgypt endeavours, within its capabilities, to contribute to\r\nthe process of economic reform through the provision of\r\ntechnical expertise in a variety of fields through the\r\nEgyptian fund for African technical cooperation.\r\nThe momentum of economic reform in the African\r\ncountries which aims at greater interaction in the\r\ninternational commercial market should be coupled with\r\ninterest in Africa’s human and social situations. In keeping\r\nwith this, we associate ourselves with the views expressed\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report on the importance of the\r\nhuman dimension and the problem of refugees in the\r\nAfrican continent. The report indeed highlights the\r\nproblem of Rwandan refugees in the Great Lakes region\r\nand stresses the necessity for the international community\r\nto secure firmly and effectively the protection and safety\r\nof the refugees and to keep their camps free of any\r\nmilitary presence, perhaps through the creation of an\r\ninternational mechanism to help the Governments of the\r\nhost countries maintain the neutrality and security of the\r\nrefugee camps.\r\nIt is also necessary in regard to these efforts to deal\r\nwith the other aspects of the refugee problem. Foremost\r\namong these are technical assistance and humanitarian\r\nassistance to the countries of the region and the\r\namelioration of social and environmental problems. The\r\nnegative implications for the peace and security of the\r\nhost country should be contained. The refugee camps\r\nmust be established away from border areas, and\r\nhumanitarian assistance should be coordinated between\r\nthe different organs of the United Nations on the one\r\nhand, and the other international aid organizations,\r\nespecially the International Committee of the Red Cross,\r\non the other.\r\nWe welcome the recommendations offered by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report of 22 September 1998\r\nconcerning protection for the humanitarian assistance\r\ngiven to refugees in situations of conflict. We hope that\r\nthe Security Council will take the necessary measures in\r\norder to implement these recommendations.\r\nNeedless to say, efforts aimed at improving\r\neconomic and social conditions in Africa require parallel\r\nefforts regionally and internationally so that the desired\r\neffects may be achieved through confronting the African\r\nconflicts which still constitute a basic impediment to\r\neconomic growth and foreign investment in Africa.\r\nTherefore, the General Assembly, in tandem with the\r\nSecurity Council, must deal with the African issues and\r\ncontribute effectively to settling these conflicts and\r\nproviding various solutions and recommendations relative\r\nto these issues.\r\nI wish to turn now to certain more specific remarks,\r\nbeginning with Somalia. The continued inattention to\r\nevents in Somalia is unacceptable. The United Nations\r\nhas to take the initiative to assess developments there and\r\nprovide possible assistance in order to facilitate the\r\nestablishment of the national reconciliation and peace that\r\nhave long been overdue there.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nFor our part, Egypt supports the efforts being made by\r\nall the parties concerned, and we will continue in our\r\nefforts to establish peace in Somalia in coordination with\r\nthe League of Arab States, the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\r\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development and all\r\nthe other concerned parties. We wish to reconfirm that the\r\nefforts to achieve national reconciliation in Somalia are not\r\nthe monopoly of a certain party. International and regional\r\nefforts should be coordinated in order to find a\r\ncomprehensive and just settlement. In this respect, Egypt\r\nstresses the importance of the role of the United Nations in\r\nsettling the situation, and we call on the United Nations to\r\nreactivate its role and fully enforce its ongoing presence\r\nthere.\r\nThere is another issue that the OAU places at the top\r\nof its priorities. All the African leaders in their statements\r\nbefore the Assembly this year called for lifting the\r\nsanctions against Libya. The Security Council has to move\r\nforward in its position on the Lockerbie crisis, especially\r\nnow that events have been moving in a positive direction.\r\nAll of us hope that progress will be achieved in good faith\r\nby all the parties concerned in the shortest time possible,\r\nwithin the framework of what the Secretary-General and his\r\nassistants are doing, with the agreements and required\r\nguarantees so that sanctions can be lifted from Libya once\r\nand for all. Thus a phase of tension would be terminated,\r\nand it is time for that to happen.\r\nDespite the fact that the United Nations has succeeded\r\nin contributing to the settlement of many crises in Africa,\r\nmost recently in Sierra Leone, the African continent still\r\nwitnesses the emergence and continuation of many crises\r\nwhich have implications for its peace and security. In his\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral referred to the continuing violence in the Great\r\nLakes region, appealed to the leaders of Burundi and\r\nRwanda to redouble their efforts to build peace and achieve\r\nnational unity and called for the necessary measures to\r\nenable the United Nations verification team to return to the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. That team had been\r\nwithdrawn following the deterioration of the situation there.\r\nPreventing the spread of arms in Africa is of primary\r\nimportance and should be treated accordingly. The\r\nSecretary-General referred to the fact that the interest in\r\ndevelopment in Africa requires the allocation of a minimum\r\nof resources to military purposes. This could be achieved\r\nthrough enforcing transparency and confidence-building\r\nmeasures in the military and security areas. We agree with\r\nhis suggestion, as the issue has implications for the\r\npreservation of international peace and security. Africa\r\nindeed showed particular interest in this field in April\r\n1996 through the conclusion of the Treaty of Pelindaba,\r\nwhich aims at making Africa a nuclear-weapon-free zone,\r\nand the adoption of the Cairo Declaration, which included\r\nseveral principles which stress Africa’s commitment to\r\nthe support of international peace and security.\r\nAnother aspect of militarization relates to the\r\nsecurity of the African continent. The illegal flow of\r\narms, especially small arms, is extremely serious and\r\nshould be confronted at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels. The political and military instability\r\nthat has affected the countries of the Great Lakes region\r\nprovides the clearest evidence of the consequences of\r\nsuch arms flows in the fomenting of endless conflicts.\r\nIn this context, Egypt supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal relating to confronting this\r\nphenomenon through the gathering and dissemination of\r\ninformation about it. The guidelines adopted by the\r\nDisarmament Commission two years ago on the illicit\r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, in addition to the\r\nrecommendations to be presented by the Panel of\r\nGovernmental Experts on Small Arms set up by the\r\nSecretary-General, should provide a framework so that we\r\ncan take effective steps to stop that serious phenomenon.\r\nAfrica today is going through an important historical\r\nstage when the values of democracy and respect for\r\nhuman rights are being consolidated. In this context,\r\nAfrica also aspires to achieve democracy at the\r\ninternational level. We hope that the reform of the United\r\nNations, including the reform and restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council, will ultimately lead to justice,\r\ndemocracy and transparency by giving Africa fair\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council in accordance with\r\nthe decisions taken at Harare by the Assembly of Heads\r\nof State and Government of the Organization of African\r\nUnity.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to underline the importance of\r\ncontinuing serious and effective coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OAU, its regional bodies and its\r\nMechanism set up to resolve the problems of the\r\ncontinent along the lines which have already begun. Here\r\nI wish to pay tribute to the OAU and its achievements in\r\nthe past few years. Its role is complementary to that of\r\nthe United Nations in settling conflicts so that peace and\r\nstability may prevail and the means to economic, social\r\nand environmental prosperity can be established\r\nthroughout Africa and elsewhere.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nMr. Babaa (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): At the outset, I should like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the important report he submitted\r\ntoday on this item. I should also like to reaffirm the\r\ncomments of the representative of Burkina Faso, who spoke\r\non behalf of the Group of African States, in particular his\r\nreference to the need to find African solutions to African\r\nproblems.\r\nOne year ago the Security Council held its first\r\nministerial-level meeting to consider the need for concerted\r\ninternational efforts to enhance peace and security in\r\nAfrica. The Secretary-General, in his report submitted to\r\nthe Council at that time, said that the scope of the\r\nchallenges facing Africa extends beyond the Security\r\nCouncil itself. My delegation therefore believes that this\r\ndiscussion gains special importance because it provides a\r\nfurther opportunity for the members of the General\r\nAssembly and the whole of the international community to\r\nshed more light on the problems of Africa and to consider\r\nthem in a way that will enable us to provide appropriate\r\nconditions for sustainable development in Africa. In that\r\nway the peoples of Africa will be able to enjoy peace and\r\nmake use of the economic opportunities available to them\r\nand which they richly deserve.\r\nIn his report in document A/52/871, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral referred to the causes of conflict in Africa and\r\nindicated that the main causes of the problems — racial\r\nconflict, tribal struggles and political instability in some of\r\nits parts, and economic underdevelopment in many of its\r\nparts — are the result of actions by those who violated the\r\nterritorial integrity of those African countries and divided\r\ntheir tribes by the borders which they demarcated. The\r\nhistory of Africa clearly shows that not a single African\r\ncountry demarcated its own borders with its neighbours.\r\nThe colonial Powers did this. Thus they fragmented\r\nkingdoms, States and groups and unjustly and arbitrarily\r\njoined unrelated tribes. In that way, when nobody was\r\nwatching, they sowed the seeds of what we now witness in\r\nthe way of the social conflict, ethnic tensions and civil wars\r\nwhich face many of the countries of the continent.\r\nAs the African continent was afflicted by foreign\r\nforces that confiscated its lands and imposed ignorance on\r\nits people, it has fared no better economically than it has\r\npolitically and socially. The colonial Powers plundered and\r\ndrained the resources of Africa. That led to distortions\r\ncaused by the colonialists in the African economy and\r\nstructures that are difficult to replace. The patterns of\r\nexchange that prevailed during the colonial period — which\r\nare based on concentrating on the extraction of minerals\r\nand other primary materials and their export for\r\nfabrication outside Africa — have been difficult to\r\nreplace. Furthermore, no significant investment took place\r\nduring that period with regard to the infrastructure such\r\nas roads, railroads, ports and airports. The education and\r\nhealth-care sectors were also neglected.\r\nFinancial and trade agreements offered to Africa by\r\nmany bilateral and multilateral institutions impose\r\nconditions that cannot lead to social peace, prosperity and\r\ndevelopment. They pave the way for unlimited foreign\r\ninvestment, the privatization of the public sector and the\r\ndevaluation of currency.\r\nMany African Governments were forced to sell their\r\npublic economic sectors, including mines, not to private\r\nAfrican sectors, but to foreign companies and monopolies\r\nwhich do not care about Africa’s interest, but whose\r\nsingle purpose is to make huge profits and to satisfy their\r\nshareholders in economic centres in other countries. Is\r\nthis not an injustice to Africa and to the sovereignty and\r\ndignity of its peoples? Those who want to help Africa\r\nshould not impose conditions on it, but should help by\r\nsupporting the potential of Africa in order to educate its\r\nchildren and enable it to exploit its resources. It is no\r\nlonger acceptable that Africa should be a source of raw\r\nmaterials and a consumer market for manufactured goods.\r\nGiving a new impetus for peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa requires taking decisive and\r\ncomprehensive actions in order to deal with the question\r\nof foreign debt afflicting the majority of African States.\r\nIt also calls for a reconsideration of the unjust conditions\r\nimposed on African Governments for assistance by\r\ninternational and private financial institutions.\r\nIf we do not reach economic and trade cooperation\r\nagreements that give Africa fair prices for its\r\ncommodities, if we do not give special support to these\r\ncountries in order to deal with the impediments to their\r\nexports, and if we do not remove the African debt in\r\nwhich the competing forces have entangled Africa,\r\nAfrican Governments will be unable to meet the basic\r\nneeds of their people. They will also find themselves\r\nfaced with continued upheavals threatening Africa’s\r\nstability and conflicts endangering its security.\r\nIt is Africa’s right to demand the cancellation of\r\ndebts. The creditors should give serious consideration to\r\nthis, if humanitarian, social and economic conditions truly\r\ncause them anxiety and if they would like to become\r\ngenuine economic and commercial partners of Africa and\r\nnot just neo-colonialists coming in another guise to\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nplunder its resources. Any relationship, whether economic\r\nor commercial, if based on equality, will be really of\r\ntangible benefit. It is not fair to ask African countries to\r\ncompete with those whose rise was due to Africa’s bounty,\r\nand whose development was accomplished at its expense.\r\nIt is unacceptable that Africa be left to flounder in its\r\nconflicts, poverty and underdevelopment while the\r\ninternational community stands by unperturbed, dropping to\r\nAfrica the crumbs of lip service, offering no solution to a\r\nproblem, no relief from hunger, no hope for salvation.\r\nAfrica has heard too many declarations and hollow\r\npromises. It is necessary to find a serious solution for the\r\nmany problems besetting many African countries, to\r\nundertake serious action in order to provide better education\r\nfor its children and to attain better health, social and\r\neconomic standards for the other population sectors in\r\nAfrica.\r\nAfrica knows very well that the responsibility for its\r\ngrowth and its progress lies primarily with its own sons.\r\nHowever, there is an external element that has greatly\r\ncontributed to the situation. Colonialism in Africa which\r\nlasted for many years is responsible for the backwardness\r\nin the continent. It is for the States which have colonized\r\nthe African peoples and exploited their resources to\r\napologize to these peoples for the indignities which they\r\nhave inflicted upon them and to fully compensate them for\r\nthe damage done to Africa.\r\nPeace in Africa is an integral part of international\r\npeace and development. Without stability in Africa there\r\nwill not be peace in the world. Without development in\r\nAfrica there will not be prosperity in the world. The\r\nmembers of the international community, particularly\r\ndeveloped States, have to contribute to African efforts in\r\norder to achieve world peace and full stability.\r\nIf developed countries really intend, and have the\r\npolitical will, to help Africa, they have to cooperate\r\npractically with the efforts of the continent in order to\r\neliminate hunger, disease and backwardness. They have to\r\nrefrain from any action that could hamper these efforts.\r\nRepressive economic measures have been imposed by some\r\ncountries on a number of States in Africa, including my\r\nown, on which unilateral American sanctions have been\r\nimposed for an entire decade. These sanctions are\r\nrepresented by the freezing of Libyan assets in United\r\nStates banks, depriving Libya of important technology\r\nneeded for its civil projects. In addition, the United States\r\nhas enacted a law that extends extraterritorially beyond\r\nAmerican jurisdiction in order to punish companies and\r\nindividuals of other nationalities.\r\nIn spite of these economic measures imposed on my\r\ncountry, it has participated unilaterally and through\r\nbilateral initiatives and multilateral initiatives in the\r\nefforts to achieve peace in our continent and to bolster\r\nstability in Africa. My country, despite the suffering of its\r\npeople for more than six years due to sanctions which the\r\nSecurity Council was forced to unjustly impose on it, has\r\nbeen generous in providing the necessary resources for\r\nthe continent and their investment in a better manner. The\r\njoint banks and companies which we established in\r\ncooperation with our African brothers, whether in\r\ntransport, fishing, mining or agriculture, are examples\r\nwhich do need elaboration and are facts which can stand\r\nby themselves with no need of proof.\r\nIn his report the Secretary-General refers to the\r\ncauses of conflict in Africa. The support of regional\r\nsubregional initiatives in Africa is necessary in order to\r\ndeal with all its problems. My country welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s remarks, as this is considered a\r\nnatural matter which comes within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Under the Charter, a special role\r\nhas been given to regional organizations to achieve the\r\npurposes of the Charter regarding the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the promotion of\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nWe look forward to the United Nations encouraging\r\nthe initiatives of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) to solve and contain the conflicts in Africa,\r\nespecially its capacity in the area of conflict resolution,\r\nthe activation of its mechanism to prevent, contain and\r\nsettle those conflicts and the consolidation of efforts to\r\nfoster multilateral cooperation and economic integration\r\namong African States. We hope that the international\r\ncommunity as a whole will take the necessary measures\r\nto guarantee the effective implementation of the activities\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s, especially in the elimination of\r\ntariff barriers facing African exports, improvement of the\r\ninfrastructures relating to economic and social\r\ndevelopment, the development of human resources and\r\nreinforcing the role of women in the development\r\nprocess. In addition, priority should be given to the least\r\ndeveloped African countries, landlocked countries and\r\ncountries that suffer from drought and desertification.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 34th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nThe Security Council has devoted two meetings in the\r\nlast two years to African problems. At its meeting last year,\r\nit contributed to solving these problems. At the Council’s\r\nmeeting of last year, my country stated that consideration\r\nof African problems should not be restricted to a particular\r\nbody, especially with regard to issues of international peace\r\nand security. It stated that this should be done at the highest\r\nlevel of the United Nations. We therefore welcome, once\r\nagain, the decision to hold this discussion here, where we\r\nhope that it will be repeated on the basis of the principle\r\nthat we have always confirmed, namely, that we have to\r\nactivate the role of the General Assembly in order for it to\r\ncarry out its function in accordance with the Charter. This\r\nincludes handling international peace and security issues\r\nand the promotion of sustainable development. We are\r\nhappy that this discussion is taking place now.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
