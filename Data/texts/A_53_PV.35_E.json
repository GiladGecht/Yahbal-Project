(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mangoaela\r\n(Lesotho), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 164 (continued)\r\nCauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/871)\r\nMr. Theron (Namibia): I have the honour to present\r\nthis statement on behalf of the Southern African States,\r\nnamely, Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,\r\nLesotho, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\r\nWe are about to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and\r\nsimultaneously we find ourselves at the threshold of a new\r\nmillennium. It is an appropriate moment to reflect and take\r\nstock on how far we have come in giving credence to the\r\naims and objectives of the Charter. This is a period of great\r\nhope and confidence in the efficacy of the United Nations.\r\nThe time is therefore quite appropriate for a new vision and\r\nforesight.\r\nWe are most grateful for this timely opportunity to\r\nparticipate in this very important debate. I therefore want to\r\nthank and congratulate the Secretary-General for his frank,\r\nanalytical and comprehensive report on the causes of\r\nconflict in Africa and for the valuable recommendations for\r\nthe prevention and resolution of social conflicts, as well\r\nas the proposals to ensure durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Only a true son of Africa with wisdom and\r\nvision, like the Secretary-General, could so accurately and\r\nextensively report on the situation as it currently exists in\r\nour continent.\r\nAs stated in the report, the challenges which face the\r\nAfrican continent, and their scope, cannot be discussed\r\nonly in the Security Council. Hence the General\r\nAssembly, as well as the other components of the United\r\nNations system, has also been tasked with discussing and\r\nimplementing as appropriate the relevant\r\nrecommendations contained in the report. This leaves us\r\nwith an ideal opportunity to ensure that the expectations\r\nof “We the peoples” are met by further enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations.\r\nWe all know that economic and social problems are\r\namong the root causes of conflicts and that stability is\r\nclosely linked to development. The Secretary-General\r\ntherefore rightly emphasized the actions required — such\r\nas democratization, good governance and sustainable\r\ndevelopment — that would, if carried out, bring about\r\ndurable peace and promote economic growth. The reality,\r\nhowever, is that official development assistance to Africa\r\nhas been drastically reduced over the past few years. The\r\nimpact of this decrease in resources considerably\r\ncontributes to the inability of the continent to become\r\nself-sufficient. In order to support development policies in\r\nAfrica, development assistance should be maintained and\r\nincreased.\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nWe wish to highlight particularly the importance of\r\nensuring that women form part and parcel of all efforts\r\ntowards conflict-resolution and sustainable development.\r\nThe problems are numerous, but we have to ensure that\r\nequality between women and men becomes a fact of life, as\r\nthis would set the stage for so much more to come.\r\nThe Secretary-General stated that Africa could not\r\ndepend solely on the developed world for assistance. He\r\nalso stated that the international community must show\r\npolitical will by taking concrete actions that would help to\r\nrealize the objectives of advancing Africa’s development\r\npriorities. In the same vein, we have time and again called\r\non the Western creditors to write off Africa’s external debt.\r\nThis deed would be viewed as an exercise of concrete\r\npolitical commitment to assist and complement Africa’s\r\nefforts to forge ahead with its own development. After all,\r\nAfrica today remains underdeveloped and suffers the most\r\nin an unstable international economic environment. The\r\ndeveloped world should therefore continue to cultivate a\r\nmore equitable and fair trade partnership with the\r\ndeveloping world.\r\nIn this regard, the Southern African region is working\r\nhard towards regional economic cooperation and\r\nintegration. Several successful initiatives have been\r\nundertaken to consolidate these efforts under the auspices\r\nof the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\r\nUnfortunately, despite these positive developments, old and\r\nnew conflicts are still part of our everyday lives.\r\nAnother important factor that could greatly contribute\r\nto alleviating some of our problems is the continued\r\nprovision of post-conflict peace-building and rehabilitation.\r\nOne can understand the concerns about the high costs\r\ninvolved in these exercises, but it should be obvious that\r\nthe advantages of securing peace and stability far outweigh\r\nthe costs of such exercises. Too often, frail, newly created\r\npeace initiatives are left alone, just to deteriorate into a war\r\nsituation again.\r\nOur region has closely followed the deliberations of\r\nthe Security Council on this item. We have noted the\r\npositive responses by the Council members that left us with\r\na sense of optimism for the future. They expressed\r\nwillingness to assist in addressing the problems identified\r\nby promising to make the proposed solutions work and by\r\nstrengthening cooperation on a number of issues. This\r\npositive attitude should give an impetus to our efforts to\r\ncooperate in a spirit of partnership.\r\nWe believe that peacemaking, peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building should remain high priorities for all of us.\r\nIt is hoped that the outcome of these deliberations on the\r\nroot causes of conflict in Africa will contribute to\r\nensuring long-term stability, peace and sustained growth\r\nand development.\r\nWe have the unenviable responsibility to prevent\r\nwhen and where necessary the escalation of further\r\nconflicts within our region, and more so when called upon\r\nto do so by legitimate Governments. These interventions\r\nare necessary to prevent massive human suffering and\r\nfurther destabilization and to preserve the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of States. This requires close\r\ncooperation and collaboration among regional and\r\nsubregional organizations that should be supported and\r\npromoted by the international community.\r\nFinally, the Southern African region recommends\r\nthat the General Assembly adopt measures that would\r\nensure that the recommendations in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report are implemented. Furthermore, we\r\npropose that the Assembly remain seized of this matter\r\nand that progress be reviewed on a regular basis.\r\nMr. Mochochoko (Lesotho): Lesotho fully\r\nassociates itself with the statements made by the\r\nrepresentatives of Burkina Faso and Namibia on behalf of\r\nthe African Group and of the southern African region,\r\nrespectively.\r\nI begin by paying tribute to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his keen interest in the peaceful resolution of conflicts\r\nin Africa and for his focused and comprehensive report\r\non the causes of conflict in Africa.\r\nI also wish to express Lesotho’s gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for the interest he has shown regarding\r\nthe situation in Lesotho. We are encouraged by the\r\nspecial interest and concern shown by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and indeed by the international community,\r\nregarding developments in Lesotho. It is our hope that the\r\nSecretary-General and the international community will\r\ncontinue to be actively involved in support of Lesotho’s\r\nefforts to consolidate peace and prevent the recurrence of\r\narmed confrontation through assistance in areas which\r\nwill facilitate the rapid re-establishment of income-\r\ngenerating activities as a means of laying a solid\r\nfoundation for the development of our country.\r\nOver the last year, the issues of peace and security\r\nin Africa have dominated the agenda of the Security\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nCouncil. On 25 September 1997, an unprecedented meeting\r\nof the Council was convened at the ministerial level to\r\nreview the state of the African continent and to consider\r\nappropriate concerted international action to promote peace\r\nand security there. As the Secretary-General pointed out\r\nthis morning, in April he submitted to the Security Council\r\nhis report on the causes of conflict in Africa in an effort to\r\naccelerate the settlement of conflicts and to promote peace\r\nand development on the continent. After its deliberations,\r\nthe Council recognized that achieving peace and security in\r\nAfrica is a continuous process; the Council therefore\r\nresolved to continue to assess progress in promoting peace\r\nand security in Africa at the level of foreign ministers on\r\na biennial basis.\r\nWe welcome the Security Council’s endorsement in\r\nresolution 1170 (1998) of the Secretary-General’s proposals\r\nin this regard, the aim of which, we believe, is the\r\ncontinued in-depth examination of the causes of conflicts in\r\nAfrica with a view to promoting durable peace and\r\ndevelopment in all parts of the continent. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal on holding Security Council meetings at\r\nthe summit level every five years is commendable and\r\ndeserves the support of the Assembly.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report indicates, each year\r\none in four countries in Africa experiences conflicts, and\r\nAfrica accounts for half of the worldwide deaths from\r\nconflicts. The sources of these conflicts are attributed to\r\nboth internal and international dimensions. It is for these\r\nreasons that joint African and international concerted efforts\r\nand coordinated contributions are essential to settle these\r\nconflicts and eliminate their causes. More importantly,\r\nAfrica has to demonstrate the will to use other, alternative\r\nmeans of dispute settlement rather than resort to the use of\r\nforce to settle conflicts. We remain confident that the\r\nmajority of African women and men are still eager to\r\nexpend their time, energy and creativity on the promotion\r\nof durable peace and sustainable development through\r\ndialogue.\r\nThe recent sad experience in Lesotho has taught us\r\nthat violence cannot be the basis for asserting one’s\r\nviewpoint, nor can it help solve disputes. As we embark on\r\nthe social and economic reconstruction of our country, we\r\nare acutely aware that dialogue must be the basic two-way\r\ninstrument in solving problems.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s assertion that,\r\neven though the primary responsibility for matters of peace\r\nand security lies with the United Nations, support for\r\nregional and subregional initiatives is both necessary and\r\ndesirable in view of the fact that the United Nations lacks\r\nthe capacity, resources and expertise to address all\r\nproblems that may arise in Africa. The contagious results\r\nof events such as occurred in Lesotho call for a much\r\nmore concerted effort by regional organizations in the\r\npromotion and resolution of conflicts. In this regard, we\r\ncommend the efforts of subregional organizations such as\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) in quelling dissidents in Sierra\r\nLeone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and\r\nrecently in Lesotho. These efforts strengthen our view\r\nthat wherever possible, the international community\r\nshould strive to complement rather than supplant Africa’s\r\nefforts to resolve Africa’s problems.\r\nWe therefore support stronger collaboration between\r\nthe United Nations and regional and subregional\r\norganizations in Africa, which in our view is essential for\r\ndealing with some of the conflict situations in Africa. The\r\nrecent meeting between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations on this issue is thus commendable. We are\r\nalso encouraged by Security Council actions to help\r\nstrengthen support for regional and subregional initiatives\r\nas well as to enhance coordination between the United\r\nNations and regional and subregional organizations in the\r\nareas of conflict prevention and the maintenance of peace.\r\nThe Secretary-General is right in pointing out that\r\nhigh among those who profit from conflicts in Africa are\r\ninternational arms merchants. The proliferation of small\r\narms continues to pose a serious threat to human security,\r\nnot only in Africa but the world over. Better control\r\nmeasures will be required to counter this proliferation. As\r\nthe Working Group created pursuant to Security Council\r\nresolution 1170 (1998) has rightly said, the flow of arms,\r\nammunition and explosives into Africa’s tensest regions\r\nis an area where the international community could\r\nquickly make a great deal of difference. Among initiatives\r\nthat can be taken in this regard are support for Africa’s\r\nefforts to build social cohesion, restoring the authority and\r\nlegitimacy of States as providers of safety and security,\r\nand enhancing African societies’ capacity to dialogue on\r\nsecurity issues in order to minimize the need for these\r\nweapons.\r\nWe urge all those who sell arms and assist their\r\nproliferation into conflict areas, particularly in Africa, to\r\ntake the necessary measures aimed at curtailing the threat\r\nposed by arms flows. We also urge the United Nations\r\nand regional and subregional organizations to take\r\nimmediate steps aimed at monitoring the accumulation\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nand transfer of small arms into conflict areas. In this regard,\r\nefforts by the Security Council aimed at strengthening the\r\neffectiveness of arms embargoes imposed by the Council\r\nare steps in the right direction.\r\nIt is evident that the scourge of conflicts in Africa\r\nundermines efforts towards economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the continent. The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport clearly shows the intrinsic linkage between peace and\r\ndevelopment. The challenge before the international\r\ncommunity is thus to work towards the achievement of\r\npeace and development in Africa. We reiterate the hope that\r\nthe General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council,\r\nother relevant bodies of the United Nations, regional and\r\nsubregional organizations, international financial institutions\r\nand other relevant organizations as well as Member States\r\nwill consider the Secretary-General’s report and its\r\nrecommendations, and take action as they deem appropriate\r\nwithin their respective areas of competence.\r\nFinally, as Africans, we are naturally perturbed by the\r\nrecent increase in the number of conflict situations in\r\nAfrica: the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo; the stalled peace process in Angola; the border\r\ndispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea; continued violence in\r\nSierra Leone and the exacerbation of conflict between\r\nSomalia and Sudan, to mention a few, are all causes of\r\nconcern to us. We appeal to all parties to these conflicts to\r\nsummon the necessary political will and rise to the\r\nchallenge of giving peace a new momentum. It is our hope\r\nthat the international community will continue to rally\r\nbehind Africa’s tireless efforts to find lasting peace,\r\nstability and development for the region. Africa’s quest for\r\nmaking peace, maintaining peace and building sustainable\r\npeace can be achieved through strengthening the United\r\nNations capacity to prevent conflict, to respond rapidly\r\nwhen conflicts erupt and to be able to provide post-conflict\r\npeace-building instruments.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania): I\r\nam speaking on behalf of the eastern African subregion,\r\ncomprising 12 countries — the Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea,\r\nEthiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles,\r\nSomalia, Sudan, Uganda and my own country, Tanzania —\r\nin support of the statement made by Burkina Faso on behalf\r\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and in the\r\nanticipation of that to be made later by Nigeria, which has\r\nthe chairmanship of the African Group for October.\r\nThe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa is our major\r\npreoccupation. We have commended the Secretary-General\r\nfor an insightful report on sources of conflict in Africa,\r\nways to prevent and address those conflicts, and how to\r\nlay the foundation for durable peace and economic growth\r\nfollowing their resolution. Allow me to reiterate those\r\nsentiments once again.\r\nThe gravity of the situation in Africa is self-evident\r\nfrom a cursory examination of the agenda of the Security\r\nCouncil. Africa dominates that agenda. The concerns of\r\nthe Security Council in exploring practical ways to\r\nprevent, reduce and resolve conflicts in Africa were\r\ntherefore both legitimate and necessary. But significantly,\r\nthere have been few solutions to the conflicts because the\r\nroot causes have not been addressed.\r\nIt is, however, true that the causes of conflict in\r\nAfrica are not unique. The conflicts in Africa are not\r\nconflicts only because their causes are African. They are\r\nconflicts most significantly because, like anywhere else,\r\nthe pervasiveness of abject poverty engenders frustrations,\r\ninstability and conflict. Indeed, there can never be real\r\npeace where injustice abounds.\r\nThe Secretary-General pointed the way. The key to\r\nthe resolution of conflicts in Africa and in all regions lies\r\nin meaningfully addressing the problems of development.\r\nIndeed, in presenting his report to the Security Council,\r\nthe Secretary-General rightly observed that\r\n“it is the persistence of poverty that is impeding the\r\nfull promise of peace for all of Africa’s peoples. The\r\nalleviation of poverty must be the first aim of our\r\nefforts. Only then — only when prosperity and\r\nopportunity become real — will every citizen, young\r\nor old, man or woman, have a genuine and lasting\r\nstake in a peaceful future for Africa — politically,\r\neconomically and socially.” (S/PV.3871, p. 4)\r\nAfrica, composed of 53 States, remains the poorest\r\nregion in the world. Of the 48 least developed countries\r\nin the world, 33 are in Africa. Africa’s poverty is further\r\nexacerbated by pressures of debt servicing, which\r\naccounts for one third of these countries’ export earnings;\r\ndeteriorating terms of trade; declining official\r\ndevelopment assistance; falling commodity prices;\r\nincreasing protectionism; and the negative effects of\r\nstructural adjustment programmes. Needless to say, such\r\nan environment attracts very little foreign direct\r\ninvestment. It is apparent, therefore, that the cake\r\navailable to meet Africa’s needs is a very small one. And\r\nit is no wonder there are many conflicts in the continent.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nIt is in this regard that we welcomed the initiative of\r\nthe Security Council and the report of the Secretary-General\r\non Africa. Indeed, when the report was first discussed in\r\nthe Security Council, there was unanimity that, while Africa\r\nbore primary responsibility for dealing with the challenges\r\nit faced, the challenge was such that Africa was incapable\r\nof facing it alone. It is in this context that we express the\r\nhope that specific and deliberate measures will be taken to\r\ntransform the Secretary-General’s recommendations into a\r\nworkable strategy for real and meaningful change in Africa.\r\nIn doing so, we need to bear in mind the World Bank’s\r\n1997 assessment of the situation:\r\n“Social indicators remain below those of other\r\nregions; fiscal deficits are high and domestic savings\r\nlow; aid dependency remains high; private investment\r\nand foreign direct investment levels, though beginning\r\nto improve, are low; and there is a significant\r\nunfinished agenda in areas such as the financial sector,\r\npublic expenditure management, and privatization.”\r\n(The World Bank Annual Report 1997)\r\nIt is a very bleak picture indeed.\r\nIn Washington the annual meetings of the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank have just concluded.\r\nWarnings about impending global economic crisis and\r\nrecession have been given. The stakes for Africa are\r\ntherefore even higher. The Bank’s President is reported to\r\nhave expressed concern that too little attention was being\r\npaid to the growing ranks of the unemployed and the risks\r\nof undercutting political stability. The poor, he warned,\r\ncannot wait. I would add that a hungry individual without\r\nshelter cannot appreciate exhortations on human rights. That\r\nindividual’s human rights are violated several times over.\r\nThus gullibility becomes a weapon of survival to the\r\ndetriment of Africa. We commend Mr. Wolfensohn for his\r\ncall to focus on sustainable development and on social\r\nissues. The warning he gave in his 6 October address to the\r\nBoard of Governors is apt:\r\n“We must do all this. Because if we do not have the\r\ncapacity to deal with social emergencies, if we do not\r\nhave longer-term plans for solid institutions, if we do\r\nnot have greater equity and social justice, there will be\r\nno political stability.”\r\nAfrica is in a state of emergency. The result of well-\r\nmeant programmes such as the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative of the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nhas proved disappointing. And yet Africa continues to face\r\na crippling debt burden at a time when the global economic\r\noutlook is not full of promise. And it is in Africa that\r\nboth the Bank and the international community are most\r\nneeded.\r\nOne of the dangers resulting from the prospect of a\r\nglobal economic slowdown is an increased tendency by\r\nStates to be inward looking. It is our hope that our shared\r\nconcern about our common humanity will drive us to\r\novercome destructive tendencies towards isolationism. At\r\nthis moment of trial, Africa needs a global partnership, a\r\npartnership that would allow it to use and fully live up to\r\nthe promise and aspirations of its people, the United\r\nNations and, indeed, the international community.\r\nIt is also in this regard that we wish to take the\r\nopportunity to especially commend those Governments\r\nthat have either taken or promised to take the necessary\r\nsteps towards debt cancellation for African countries, and\r\nparticularly the least developed among them. We should\r\nalso express our appreciation to the donor countries for\r\ntheir commitment to Africa. Our special gratitude goes to\r\nthe Netherlands and the Nordic countries for having\r\nattained the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their\r\ngross national product for official development assistance.\r\nThey are standard bearers for any undertaking this\r\nOrganization is committed to. We also recognize and\r\nappreciate Japan’s initiatives on African development\r\nbased on new partnerships. The second Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development is\r\nscheduled to convene in Tokyo in less than a fortnight’s\r\ntime.\r\nThere are countries such as Tanzania that have not\r\nexperienced the kind of conflicts that have bedevilled\r\nAfrica and yet are not immune from the effects of tension\r\nand strife elsewhere. Conflicts have been sources of\r\nuncontrollable influxes of refugees. These have\r\noccasioned untold human suffering to both the refugees\r\nand the host countries. While refugees deserve and\r\ndesperately need help, so do the host countries, which\r\nhave to cope with an unbearable burden with very limited\r\nresources, and experience considerable destruction to the\r\nenvironment. The United Republic of Tanzania — host to\r\nover 300,000 refugees, a number that is growing as a\r\nresult of the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Burundi — is particularly concerned about the\r\nlevel of international commitment to the burden it bears.\r\nWe therefore continue to make a special appeal for\r\nsupport — for it is not uncommon to read reports on\r\ncontributions to refugees that are silent about the great\r\nsacrifice that is being made by the host countries.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the wish of my\r\nsubregion, and indeed of Africa, that all hope is not lost. It\r\nwill therefore be reassuring if this Assembly adopts under\r\nthis agenda item a resolution that seeks to implement the\r\ntwin goals of peace and security, on the one hand, and\r\ndevelopment on the other. This, we believe, is the challenge\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General has set us. Indeed, what\r\nAfrica needs are not handouts, but the wherewithal for\r\nmeaningful development. Consequently, investments in\r\nhuman capital, physical infrastructure, such as roads and\r\nrailways, the provision of credit, and access to markets —\r\nto mention but a few critical elements — can speed up the\r\npositive changes that have been the hallmark of the last five\r\nyears.\r\nAfrica is ready to move forward. What is required is\r\na new, genuine partnership based on mutual respect and\r\npredicated on the premise that Africa needs to be taught\r\nhow to fish and not to receive shiploads of fish.\r\nMr. Kasanda (Zambia): In the past few years the\r\nSecurity Council agenda has been crowded with problems\r\nrelating to Africa. Last April the Secretary-General took a\r\nbold step in producing a report entitled “The causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa”. It is fitting that we should be\r\nconsidering this well-thought-out report.\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his landmark document, which brings many ideas and\r\napproaches to the range of problems and opportunities in\r\nthe continent of Africa. To be sure, through this document\r\nthe Secretary-General has neatly put Africa’s problems in\r\ntheir proper perspective. He has rightly identified the fact\r\nthat the sources of Africa’s problems lie in both diverse and\r\ncomplex internal and external interactions. He has also\r\nmade far-reaching recommendations on which action by the\r\nUnited Nations is urgently required.\r\nThe fact that the Assembly today is considering\r\nagenda item 164 on Africa underlines the international\r\ncommunity’s growing concern about the need to establish\r\nconditions amenable to peace, security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. It is common knowledge that\r\nAfrica, in the overall global framework, is lagging behind\r\nin economic development and is facing the stark realities of\r\nmarginalization as compared to other continents. The reason\r\nfor this situation lies in the severe socio-economic and\r\npolitical problems that confront Africa.\r\nThe countries of the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) have not only continued to face the\r\nage-old problem of Angola; the new conflict in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has also further\r\ncomplicated and enlarged the region’s area of concern for\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe situation in Angola has continued to deteriorate,\r\ndespite the international community’s patience and its\r\nefforts to bring Africa’s oldest civil conflict to an end.\r\nZambia is concerned that the hopes for peace and\r\nstability, as envisaged in the Lusaka Protocol, have not so\r\nfar been realized. The reason for this lies squarely at the\r\ndoor of Jonas Savimbi, who has refused to abide by his\r\nobligations under the Lusaka Protocol. We have already\r\ngone a long way down the road to peace. Neighbouring\r\ncountries and the United Nations have invested\r\nconsiderable effort and resources in the search for peace\r\nin Angola. We cannot afford now to abandon the Angolan\r\npeople, who have suffered so much and whose hopes\r\nwere pinned on the Lusaka Protocol. We hope, therefore,\r\nthat in spite of the setbacks, the international community,\r\nthrough the Security Council, will reassert its authority\r\nand use its immense wisdom to put the Angolan peace\r\nprocess back on track.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Zambia has been actively\r\ninvolved in the search by regional leaders for a lasting\r\nand peaceful solution. The leaders of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community and other regional\r\nleaders have done a commendable job in this regard under\r\nvery difficult circumstances. As the Assembly is well\r\naware, the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nis the primary responsibility of the Security Council.\r\nThere is no doubt that the situation in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, if unresolved, could pose a threat\r\nnot only to the region, but also to international peace and\r\nsecurity. The mediation efforts of SADC and other\r\nregional leaders, therefore, deserve the support of the\r\ninternational community, as these efforts are intended to\r\nforestall the threat to international peace and security\r\nwhich this crisis poses.\r\nIn the same vein, Africa has a responsibility to\r\nensure good governance and respect for human rights in\r\nthe process of achieving durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. All too often conflicts are in large\r\nmeasure the result of lack of political tolerance, lack of\r\nrespect for the sanctity of life and lack of inclusiveness in\r\nthe public administrations in African countries. It is\r\npleasing, however, that many countries in Africa have\r\ntaken appropriate steps to permit democracy to thrive and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nto ensure respect for the rule of law, which are part of the\r\nprimary conditions for peace and sustainable development.\r\nThe Secretary-General in his report has neatly\r\ncaptured the interrelationship between peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Africa’s greatest development\r\nchallenge is to reduce poverty. The international consensus\r\nis that there should be a 50 per cent reduction of poverty\r\namong the world’s poor by 2015. My country has\r\nchallenged itself to reduce poverty among 50 per cent of its\r\npopulation by 2004.\r\nWhile we recognize that development is a supreme\r\nnational effort, the complementary process of international\r\ncooperation is also a vital input. Market access is a key\r\nfactor in regenerating growth and development in Africa.\r\nDeveloped countries need to resist protectionist tendencies\r\ntowards African exports, not just to facilitate a qualitative\r\nand quantitative expansion of African export trade, but also\r\nto facilitate the sustenance of the extensive liberalization\r\nthat Africa has been painfully undertaking.\r\nThe external debts of African countries need to be\r\nsignificantly reduced beyond the internationally agreed 80\r\nper cent relief. Complete write-offs will have to be\r\nundertaken for many African countries as well. The\r\ninternational community faces the challenge to provide\r\nAfrica with a lasting exit from unsustainable debt burdens.\r\nThe Mauritius Mandate is a welcome step in this direction.\r\nWe also welcome the recent agreements to liberalize and\r\nextend the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)\r\nInitiative.\r\nAfter a period of decline, World Bank lending to\r\nAfrica is recovering. Since much of Africa depends on\r\nconcessional borrowing, early agreement on the twelfth\r\nreplenishment of the International Development Association\r\nis vital. We fully support the view that this should be\r\nachieved before the end of this year. Official development\r\nassistance in general has been declining for the past five\r\nyears. This trend needs to be reversed with a sense of\r\nurgency.\r\nCapacity-building in economic management is a vital\r\npart of promoting African development. Technical\r\nassistance programmes should give a major emphasis in this\r\narea. African development will continue with a dynamism\r\nof its own if the local capacity to manage African\r\neconomies is established and sustained.\r\nFor its part, Africa is proceeding with numerous\r\ninitiatives to promote development in such areas as\r\ndemocratization, economic liberalization and the\r\npromotion of economic integration. However, situations\r\nsuch as those obtaining in Lesotho, Angola, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and other parts of\r\nAfrica will always cruelly remind us that the greatest\r\ninternal impediments to African development are\r\nconflicts. The interplay of peace-building and prosperity\r\nshould go a long way in removing conflicts in Africa.\r\nMr. Konishi (Japan): The Japanese delegation\r\nheartily welcomes this meeting of the General Assembly\r\nconvened to address the problems confronting Africa.\r\nConsidering that Africa embraces more than a quarter of\r\nthe Member States of the United Nations and accounts for\r\nabout 13 per cent of the world’s population, there is no\r\ndoubt that global peace and prosperity will not be ensured\r\nin the twenty-first century unless peace and prosperity\r\nalso prevail throughout Africa. Addressing African\r\nproblems is thus an urgent task, not only for the countries\r\nand peoples of that continent, but also for the\r\ninternational community as a whole, and especially for the\r\nUnited Nations, the world’s sole truly universal\r\norganization.\r\nAlthough it is on the problems of Africa that we are\r\nfocusing our attention today, I would like to stress that,\r\nbased on the progress Africa has made in the political,\r\neconomic and social areas, my Government believes that\r\nthe outlook for the continent is positive. Indeed, in many\r\nAfrican countries, remarkable progress has been recorded\r\nin terms of democratization, economic reforms and social\r\ndevelopment. Approximately 20 African countries have\r\nnow attained an annual economic growth rate of more\r\nthan 5 per cent. Also encouraging is the regional\r\ncooperation that is flourishing among those States, thanks\r\nin no small part to the efforts of regional and subregional\r\norganizations, such as the Organization of African Unity.\r\nThese achievements, together with the amply\r\ndemonstrated intention of many African States to enhance\r\nand continue the current positive trend, augur well for\r\nAfrica’s bright future.\r\nNevertheless, as the report of the Secretary-General\r\nclearly states, there remains much work to be done, by\r\nAfrican States themselves and by the international\r\ncommunity, in order to sustain the current positive trend\r\nand to prevent any crises that could jeopardize the\r\nachievements that have been attained so far. The\r\nfundamental message conveyed in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General is simple and clear: We must address\r\nthe root causes of the problems besetting Africa. This will\r\nrequire a comprehensive approach that encompasses\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nactivities for the maintenance of peace and security as well\r\nas those for the promotion of economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy country fully subscribes to this message. As a\r\nmatter of fact, Japan has been vigorously advocating the\r\nneed for a comprehensive approach. In the development\r\nfield, for example, it is calling for a new development\r\nstrategy, a concept it introduced at the first Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development (TICAD\r\nI) in 1993. In subsequent efforts to implement this new\r\ndevelopment strategy, it convened two Asia-Africa\r\nforums — in Bandung in 1994 and in Bangkok in 1997 —\r\nand it has promoted cooperation between African countries,\r\nsuch as Côte d’Ivoire, Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, as well\r\nas between donor countries.\r\nAlong with these efforts in the field of development,\r\nJapan has been promoting the concept of conflict\r\nprevention, and in January this year it hosted the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on Preventive Strategy. This\r\nConference underlined the importance of developing a\r\nconceptual framework for a preventive strategy\r\nencompassing the United Nations, regional organizations,\r\nMember States and civil society. It recommended a series\r\nof measures which the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations might take immediately, including those\r\nrelating to the enhancement of Africa’s preventive capacity,\r\nespecially the early warning capability, and the effective\r\nmonitoring of the accumulation and transfer of small arms\r\nto conflict areas.\r\nBuilding upon these efforts, later this month Japan will\r\nhost TICAD II, in which high-level representatives,\r\nincluding heads of State, from more than 80 countries and\r\norganizations, as well as the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, are expected to participate. It is anticipated\r\nthat the Conference will adopt an agenda for action\r\nidentifying critical development issues in Africa,\r\narticulating the goals and objectives of efforts to address\r\nthose issues and encouraging the international community\r\nto mobilize in order to achieve those goals. This agenda for\r\naction will underscore the importance of conflict prevention\r\nand post-conflict reconstruction in restoring stability\r\nthroughout society, which is a prerequisite for development.\r\nJapan hopes that, in taking these and other initiatives,\r\nit will play a role as catalyst in the actual implementation\r\nof this comprehensive strategy aimed at addressing\r\nproblems of conflict and development.\r\nWe are all familiar with the actions which the\r\nSecurity Council has taken, as well as those that it intends\r\nto take, in responding to the recommendations contained\r\nin the report of the Secretary-General. At its ministerial\r\nmeeting on 24 September, the Council confirmed its\r\ndetermination to continue to address the various problems\r\nconfronting Africa. As a non-permanent member of the\r\nCouncil, Japan has been taking active part in that work.\r\nIn particular, my Government is determined to achieve\r\npractical results through its role as coordinator of the\r\nworking group on stemming illicit flows of arms to and\r\nin Africa.\r\nClearly, however, the Security Council alone cannot\r\nrespond adequately to the problems of Africa. It was the\r\nrecognition of the need for a comprehensive approach to\r\nAfrican problems that prompted the Security Council to\r\nrequest the Secretary-General to prepare for it a report\r\nthat would also be presented to the General Assembly;\r\nand indeed, the numerous recommendations put forward\r\nin the report extend far beyond the competence of the\r\nSecurity Council. Thus, as the Council embarked upon a\r\nconcrete course of action to respond to those\r\nrecommendations relating to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, it called upon other\r\nUnited Nations bodies, in particular the General Assembly\r\nand the Economic and Social Council, to urgently\r\nconsider taking action to follow up those\r\nrecommendations that relate to their respective areas of\r\nendeavour.\r\nOn this occasion, the Government of Japan strongly\r\nurges the General Assembly to respond immediately to\r\nthis call for action by the Security Council. Indeed, it is\r\nincumbent upon the General Assembly, in close\r\ncoordination with the Security Council and the Economic\r\nand Social Council, to thoroughly consider the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations and take concrete actions\r\naimed at achieving durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Japan is determined to contribute\r\nto this process in cooperation with other like minded\r\ncountries. The degree to which we are successful in\r\naddressing the problems of Africa now will be an\r\nimportant factor in determining the well being of the\r\nworld as a whole in the twenty-first century.\r\nMr. Valle (Brazil): At the close of the general\r\ndebate last week, the President of the General Assembly\r\npointed out that the need to address the causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of peace and sustainable development\r\nin Africa was a subject raised almost unanimously by the\r\ninternational community. This is an opportunity to\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nconsider this issue in depth and to broaden a discussion that\r\nhas already been taken up in the Security Council.\r\nIndeed, twice this year Brazil has expressed its views\r\nin this matter. The first time was on 24 April, when the\r\nSecurity Council discussed the thought-provoking report\r\nprepared by the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Subsequently, on 24 September, at\r\nthe ministerial meeting of that body, the Minister for\r\nForeign Relations of Brazil, Ambassador Luiz Felipe\r\nLampreia, extensively covered the subject of our discussion.\r\nOn both occasions, Brazil underlined the need for the\r\nestablishment of procedures that would ensure adequate\r\nintergovernmental coordination within the United Nations\r\nsystem to deal with conflict prevention and transition from\r\npeacekeeping to reconstruction.\r\nMy delegation is particularly interested in looking at\r\nways to implement Article 65 of the Charter, which allows\r\nthe Economic and Social Council to provide information to\r\nand assist the Security Council, as the Secretary-General\r\nreminds us in his report on the work of the Organization.\r\nThe General Assembly is in fact empowered to give\r\nguidance to both the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nSecurity Council to devise more efficient ways to increase\r\ncoordination in the multilateral response to the complex\r\ncrises that have arisen in Africa.\r\nAfrica has historically suffered more than the other\r\nregions of our planet. A historian of the continent wrote\r\nrecently,\r\n“Africa has been woefully misunderstood and misused\r\nby the rest of the world. Humanity simply does not\r\nrecognize its debts and obligations to Africa.”\r\nIn the Americas, Africa’s influence has been determinant\r\nwith its significant contribution to the culture and formation\r\nof societies.\r\nPresident Konaré of Mali has offered his vision for the\r\nfuture of Africa, which we share. I should like to quote\r\nhim:\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n“The future of our continent does not lie in the\r\nemergence of ethnic republics, which will only lead us\r\ninto general anarchy. It is important, we feel, not to\r\ndeny, much less crush expressions of autonomy. They\r\nmust be managed politically in a democratic context\r\nof the basic transfer of power and the emergence of\r\nlocal power with a view towards regional\r\nintegration ... [Borders] must be managed as ... joint\r\nareas and shared space.”\r\nThese wise words spoken by an African statesman can be\r\nseen as a source of inspiration for Africa and other\r\nregions of the world.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has provided us with\r\na focused report. His objective analysis and thoughtful\r\nrecommendations have led the Security Council to start a\r\nprocess of following up on the recommendations that\r\nproduced important documents in areas such as the\r\nenhancement of international sanctions regimes and the\r\nimprovement of the capacity of African regional and\r\nsubregional organizations in the area of conflict\r\nprevention.\r\nBrazil enthusiastically supported the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal for convening a ministerial meeting of\r\nthe Security Council on Africa on a biennial basis. This\r\nwill enable the international community, at a high\r\npolitical level, to focus on the problems faced by Africa\r\nand cooperate in identifying the necessary solutions. The\r\nSecurity Council, however, is not the most appropriate\r\norgan of the United Nation to address the root causes of\r\nconflict, which are embedded in deep social and economic\r\nfactors.\r\nBrazil believes that the General Assembly, with the\r\nlegitimacy of its almost universal membership, has the\r\nmoral authority to call the many autonomous subsystems\r\nwithin the domain of the United Nations system to truly\r\nrespond to the Secretary-General’s summoning of political\r\nwill. In this interdependent world of ours, cooperation and\r\ncoordination are the key actions to ensure success. A\r\npeaceful, stable and prosperous Africa is a crucial element\r\nto world stability. It is essential that the Governments\r\nhere represented coordinate their voices in the various\r\nforums so as to harmonize current and future international\r\ninitiatives on Africa, in order to ensure that their lofty\r\ngoals may be attained.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French): First\r\nof all, I would like to associate myself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Burkina Faso in his\r\ncapacity as representative of the current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nAllow me first of all to express on behalf of my\r\ncountry, Senegal, our warmest congratulations to the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his outstanding\r\nreport on the causes of conflicts and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa. We\r\nhave before us a reference document with relevant\r\ndiagnosis, in-depth analysis and practical suggestions.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the report has been\r\nsubmitted to the Security Council, which considered it in an\r\nopen debate on 24 April 1998, to the General Assembly\r\nand to other bodies of the United Nations system, including\r\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This\r\nis a frank, insightful, comprehensive and forward-looking\r\nreport.\r\nMy delegation is also gratified at the outstanding work\r\nunder way in the Security Council through which various\r\nworking bodies have been established on the aspects of the\r\nreport that fall under the competence of the Council.\r\nMoreover, the ministerial meeting of the Security Council\r\nof 24 September 1998 was an important landmark in the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in the\r\nreport.\r\nThe situation on our continent has been developing\r\nvery rapidly. In addition to the traditional, or classic, type\r\nof conflict, there are now conflicts of a new type — a new\r\ngeneration of conflicts, we could say — that bring in new\r\nplayers and are more complex and politically sensitive\r\nbecause they primarily involve internal contradictions.\r\nThe end of East-West antagonism seemed conducive\r\nto a qualitative revolution in the geopolitics of threats and\r\nin measures to prevent political, economic and social\r\ntensions in Africa.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General has appropriately\r\nhighlighted this new state of affairs, while emphasizing the\r\nrole of internal and external factors as well as the\r\nunderlying economic and financial causes of contemporary\r\nconflicts in Africa.\r\nTherefore, my delegation attaches great importance to\r\ndeveloping an innovative, dynamic and multidisciplinary\r\napproach within this framework, simultaneously taking into\r\naccount the varied sources of conflicts, the nature of the\r\nnew players and the unprecedented changes that\r\ncharacterize the African political scene. Indeed, the process\r\nof democratization in Africa seems also to be accompanied\r\nby a process of economic and commercial marginalization\r\nand an intensification of impoverishment, despite the\r\ncolossal efforts made by numerous African countries within\r\nthe framework of a dual transition to reform their\r\neconomies and to expand democracy.\r\nOther phenomena should be duly taken into account\r\nin the overall analysis, as well as in considering effective\r\nsolutions to the political and institutional instability in a\r\nnumber of countries of the continent. I shall mention a\r\nfew.\r\nLarge-scale banditry is growing exponentially, and\r\nits destabilizing activities are facilitated by, inter alia,\r\nillicit flows of arms, in particular small arms, and by the\r\nporous nature of borders between States.\r\nAnother phenomenon is the political struggles,\r\nsometimes violent, between opposition and ruling parties,\r\ncarried out by third-party militias, in contravention of the\r\nrules of democracy and constitutional law. Such struggles\r\nin some cases lead to military coups d’état against\r\ndemocratically elected regimes.\r\nThere are also the mutinies of factions of the armed\r\nforces that occur when demands for material needs or\r\nsalary turn into political demands, leading to coups d’état\r\nor attempted coups d’état.\r\nAnother problem is the “ethnicization” of political\r\nand social life and the resurgence of identity conflicts,\r\nparticularly in desert or mountainous zones, resulting, for\r\nexample, from land ownership problems or the emergence\r\nof ruptures in ethnic or regional balances in the\r\ndistribution of competences and national wealth.\r\nIn addition, there are objective constraints arising\r\nfrom the difficulty certain countries have in controlling\r\nethnic armed bands in the refugee camps.\r\nLast but not least, the reviews being conducted by\r\ncertain countries of their policies on borders and\r\nneighbouring countries call into question the principle laid\r\ndown by the OAU bearing on the uti possidetis juris —\r\nthe inviolability of borders inherited from colonialism.\r\nThis list cannot be exhaustive because the variables\r\nthat explain the causes of conflict are many and complex.\r\nThis complexity brings us to the crucial point of the\r\nnecessity of adopting of mechanisms for the prevention,\r\nmanagement and settlement of crises in Africa.\r\nAt the pan-African level, the OAU has dedicated\r\nitself to this difficult and complex task since 1992\r\nthrough its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nManagement and Resolution. Its action and initiatives\r\nshould be further supported by the United Nations and by\r\nthe entire international community, whose contribution to\r\nthe OAU Peace Fund is very much to be desired.\r\nThe Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), like the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) and other subregional organizations,\r\nis also developing its own subregional mechanisms. In July\r\n1998, in Banjul, Gambia, the Ministers of Defence, the\r\nInterior and Security adopted an important document\r\nbearing on the creation of a mechanism for prevention,\r\nmanagement and settlement of conflicts, as well as for\r\nmaintaining peace and security in West Africa. This\r\nmechanism provides for the establishment of an observer\r\ngroup, a council of mediation and security and a council of\r\nsages. ECOWAS, through its Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG), is henceforth empowered to intervene in each\r\nof its 16 member States when the situation prevailing in\r\nany one of them entails serious risk of humanitarian\r\ndisaster, threatens the peace and security of the subregion\r\nor constitutes an overthrow or an attempted overthrow of a\r\ndemocratically elected regime.\r\nMy delegation believes that strengthening, expanding\r\nand honing the mechanisms for concerted action and\r\nconsultation between the OAU and the United Nations are\r\nof the utmost importance, in the aim of strengthening the\r\nAfrican capacity in the prevention, management and\r\nsettlement of conflicts and consolidation of peace. This\r\nfinal aspect — the consolidation of peace — deserves to be\r\nfurther taken into consideration, for beyond its political\r\ndimension, the consolidation of peace implies, above all,\r\neconomic, financial and humanitarian assistance for\r\nreconstruction and for reintegration into the social fabric of\r\nthe fighters, refugees and other displaced persons.\r\nNaturally, the effectiveness of the machinery\r\nestablished depends on the political will of Governments.\r\nMy country, Senegal, which has made a significant\r\ncontribution to the establishment of the OAU and\r\nECOWAS mechanism, and which even convened in Dakar,\r\nin December 1995, an international seminar on preventive\r\ndiplomacy and the maintenance of peace in Africa, remains\r\nmore inclined than ever to support efforts in Africa and\r\nelsewhere on behalf of peace, stability and security.\r\nMy country pays tribute to the efforts of France, the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the United States to assist the African\r\ncountries in strengthening their ability to prevent conflicts\r\nand maintain peace. The initiative undertaken by Japan to\r\nhold in Tokyo in January 1998 a conference on preventive\r\nstrategy in which the situation in Africa was central to the\r\nagenda must also be hailed.\r\nIt has often been recalled the peace is not merely the\r\nabsence of war. As His Holiness Pope John Paul II\r\nproclaimed, “Development must be the new name of\r\npeace”. The report of the Secretary-General has the merit\r\nof drawing its essential force from the dynamic\r\ninteraction it wisely establishes between the promotion of\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa. The General\r\nAssembly, in its area of competence, and the other bodies\r\nof the United Nations system, including the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions, should today, more than ever, take\r\ninto account the serious development constraints which\r\nAfrica is courageously facing.\r\nIt must be noted with satisfaction that the World\r\nBank and the funds and programmes of the United\r\nNations system are currently engaged in reorienting their\r\naid measures to better assist the efforts of African\r\nGovernments with a view to ensuring development,\r\ngrowth and good governance in the continent.\r\nOfficial development assistance should be\r\nstrengthened instead of being reduced from year to year.\r\nAdjustment programmes should be made more compatible\r\nwith social tranquillity. New and additional substantive\r\nresources should be mobilized. The scope of the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, jointly\r\nundertaken by the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund, should be expanded. The question of the\r\nAfrican debt should be seriously examined, and\r\nacceptable solutions should rapidly be found. The idea of\r\na special conference devoted to the question of African\r\ndebt is even more relevant today. The machinery of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization should be reconsidered in order\r\nbetter to respond to the interests and concerns of the\r\nAfrican countries, which are living in an environment\r\ndominated by globalization of the economy.\r\nIn sum, the international community, as was\r\nsuggested several years ago by Senegal’s head of State,\r\nPresident Abdou Diouf, should seek to draw up a\r\n“Marshall Plan for Africa”, for an Africa that needs not\r\nonly compassion but above all assistance and partnership\r\nin a spirit of solidarity and dignity.\r\nMr. Saad (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nToday we are considering an issue that is of special\r\nimportance and great concern to us, due to its close\r\nrelationship with the effectiveness and activities of the\r\nUnited Nations in meeting its obligations vis-à-vis peace,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nsecurity and development, and due to its relationship with\r\nthe credibility of the various components of the\r\ninternational community as we strive for a world based on\r\nsolidarity, cooperation and responsiveness to events and\r\ndevelopments.\r\nI should like, on behalf of my delegation, to pay\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General, who has provided us with\r\na report that sets out a particular vision of the situation in\r\nAfrica in all its aspects. It constitutes a basis for\r\nunderstanding and discussing the increase in conflicts in\r\nAfrica, the suffering of the African people and the obstacles\r\nthey face in the process of reconstruction and development.\r\nWhile we believe that such a basis is required and\r\nnecessary, if we are to find practical solutions and establish\r\nframeworks and means of implementing and applying\r\nsolutions on the ground, it is not in itself sufficient and will\r\nnot be effective unless it is translated into action and leads\r\nto a coordinated and common effort by all.\r\nDiscussion of Africa and its needs has been slow to\r\nstart. However, the report of the Secretary-General has been\r\nsubmitted in timely fashion, and we now need to follow it\r\nup with serious, determined and timely steps in order to\r\nprevent problems from deteriorating, with disastrous or\r\neven catastrophic consequences.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen pays particular attention to\r\nevents and developments in the African continent, whether\r\npositive or negative, because of its historical and\r\ngeographic ties with Africa, its relationship with the African\r\npeople and our common interests that stem from those ties.\r\nWe in the Republic of Yemen are affected both positively\r\nand negatively by events and developments in Africa. There\r\nis no clearer proof of how Yemen is affected by these\r\nevents than the suffering experienced by Yemen as a result\r\nof it being a neighbouring country to the Horn of Africa,\r\nwith its internal conflicts and natural disasters. My country\r\nhas always tried to help to find solutions to those problems\r\nand to overcome the obstacles faced by the countries of the\r\nregion. The capital of my country, Sana’a, has hosted\r\nseveral meetings between the warring Somali factions in an\r\nattempt to put and end to the crisis in Somalia, achieve\r\nreconciliation and establish a basis for peace and stability\r\nin the country.\r\nThe efforts of Yemen and of other countries and\r\nregional and international organizations, including the\r\nUnited Nations, may not have led to definitive and positive\r\nresults in Somalia, but we see the light of hope and\r\noptimism and believe that further efforts in this field will\r\nlead to further cause for hope until the present darkness\r\ndisappears. We believe that close and coordinated\r\ncooperation among the countries neighbouring Somalia,\r\nsupported by the power, capacities and experience of the\r\nUnited Nations, reinforcing the efforts of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) and other relevant regional and\r\nsubregional organizations, is very important and necessary\r\nif we are to find a solution to the dilemma faced by\r\nSomalia. The experience of the United Nations in Somalia\r\nmay have been one of bitterness and failure, but we must\r\npersevere in our efforts and apply still greater efforts so\r\nas to achieve results.\r\nThe question of Somali refugees is an urgent\r\nhumanitarian issue. Despite its limited resources, Yemen\r\nhas opened its ports to receive Somali refugees out of a\r\nsense of responsibility and good-neighbourliness. The\r\nprolonged crisis in Somalia and the presence of Somali\r\nrefugees in Yemen represent serious problems for the\r\nGovernment of Yemen. This is in addition to the\r\ndifficulties faced by the Government with regard to the\r\ninternal economic and financial situation and the\r\ninternational economic crisis.\r\nWe believe that the resources provided by the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\nare not commensurate with the scale of the problems\r\nfacing Yemen, which houses these Somali refugees. These\r\nresources do not meet the requisite needs of the refugees.\r\nThe situation and needs of the Somali refugees in Yemen\r\nmust, therefore, be reviewed and reassessed; we must\r\nshoulder our responsibilities for their humanitarian needs.\r\nWith regard to the conflict between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea and its effects on the Horn of Africa and the\r\nsouthern entrance to the Red Sea, the Republic of Yemen\r\nis gravely concerned by its continuation and the escalation\r\nof tensions. We hope that a peaceful solution can be\r\nfound to that conflict.\r\nThe problems and concerns of the African continent\r\nrequire common understanding and close cooperation. We\r\nmust respond quickly if we are to put an end to the\r\ndeteriorating situation. My country hopes that that will be\r\nachieved on the ground without further delay, as any\r\ndelay will aggravate the situation and greatly increase the\r\neconomic, political and humanitarian costs.\r\nMr. Jele (South Africa): South Africa commends the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. This comprehensive report raises\r\nissues which are as timely as they are important for us in\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nAfrica. It is significant that the report identifies some of the\r\nroot causes of Africa’s dilemmas, as well as provides\r\nguidelines on conflict management and resolution.\r\nMr. Maidin (Brunei Darussalam), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nAlthough Africa’s colonial past should not be used as\r\nan excuse to justify the current challenges, it is important\r\nto take into account the legacy bequeathed to the continent\r\nwhen assessing its prospects for peace and development.\r\nIndeed, some of these challenges originated in Africa’s\r\ncolonial partitioning, the arbitrariness of its borders and the\r\nsetting of one locality against another in line with the old\r\nadage of divide and rule. Africa’s past therefore sets a\r\ncontext within which some of its current problems should\r\nbe seen. Nevertheless, our greatest challenge in Africa is to\r\nfind a solution to our problems in a manner which ensures\r\nthe continent its rightful place in the community of nations,\r\nwith our people in control of their own destiny.\r\nWe in South Africa believe that success in these\r\nendeavours can be measured by the extent to which our\r\npeople enjoy the right to democratic institutions,\r\ntransparency in government, governance through\r\nconstitutionality, the rule of law and full observance of\r\nhuman rights. We consider these norms as basic for\r\nensuring peace, stability and prosperity.\r\nIndeed, in many respects, we in Africa have gone a\r\nlong way, during this decade in particular, in democratizing\r\nour societies. However, for democracy to be sustainable and\r\nsecured it must be underpinned by economic development,\r\nparticularly by the need to exercise the right to development\r\nbecause the existence of extreme poverty, hunger,\r\ndeprivation and lack of access to basic needs contributes to\r\ninstability and conflict.\r\nIt is for this reason that Africa has constantly striven\r\nfor the establishment of just and equitable economic\r\nrelations with the developed countries, relations that will\r\nhelp forge a genuine and meaningful partnership in\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report should therefore serve\r\nas a basis for beginning a new relationship with Africa for\r\nits development. Most countries in Africa still wrestle with\r\nexternal indebtedness and its overhang. This is a severe\r\ndrain on resources and an absolute brake on development.\r\nDeveloped countries should, moreover, rethink and\r\nreverse the decline in development assistance programmes\r\nto make them more effective and capable of delivery to\r\nthe very people who need this assistance.\r\nGlobalization and liberalization have had negative\r\nimpacts in some respects on powerful, sounder\r\neconomies. For Africa’s economies, the impact of\r\nglobalization is often devastating. There is therefore an\r\nurgent need for concerted international efforts to continue\r\nto address this problem in order to mitigate its impact on\r\nour fragile economies.\r\nIn spite of these challenges to Africa’s development,\r\nthe situation is not one of utter gloom, but one of hope\r\ncoming from positive economic indicators in some\r\nregions. In the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity, for instance, recent economic performance\r\nhas, overall, been positive. The economic growth rate has\r\nranged between 2 and 8 per cent, and the average growth\r\nrate is about 3.8 per cent. The region has also designed\r\nnational reconstruction and development programmes\r\ndirected at complementing efforts for regional economic\r\nintegration.\r\nSound macroeconomic policies are in place in a\r\nnumber of African countries. However, success in\r\nattracting foreign direct investment is still elusive.\r\nSupportive international development efforts would\r\ntherefore be helpful in assisting African economies in the\r\nrelocation of capital directed at foreign direct investment.\r\nThe incidence of military coups in Africa has been\r\na matter of deep concern to the continent and the\r\ninternational community. Coups are unconstitutional and\r\ndisruptive and lead to much suffering and political and\r\nsocial dislocation.\r\nSouth Africa is committed to the resolution of\r\nconflicts through peaceful means. We believe that if such\r\nmeans are comprehensive and inclusive of all parties to a\r\ndispute, that would help secure a lasting political solution.\r\nAfrica has the world’s largest arsenal of small arms\r\nin circulation and continues to be a theatre of conflict and\r\ncivil strife partly because of the preponderance of illicit\r\ntransfers of these arms. In a number of our countries the\r\nillicit transfer of arms has contributed to increased acts of\r\nviolence and prolonged conflicts, which undermine the\r\nchances for peace agreements and impede national\r\ndevelopment and reconstruction.\r\nIt is for these reasons that South Africa also shares\r\nthe concern expressed in the report at the proliferation of\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\narms and supports the proposal for strengthening the\r\ninternational and domestic instruments to synchronize\r\npolicies against illicit arms-trafficking.\r\nIt is indeed important for Member States to participate\r\nin the provision of information to the United Nations\r\nRegister of Conventional Arms and to establish\r\nsupplementary subregional registers.\r\nWe also believe that increasing expenditure on\r\narmaments should be avoided, as the scarce resources that\r\nare spent would be better utilized if targeted for\r\ndevelopment purposes. Besides, such expenditure may also\r\nnurture and engender a culture of armed aggression and\r\nmilitary coups.\r\nConflict prevention requires increased coordinated\r\nefforts by the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), together with subregional actors,\r\nequipped with early warning systems and complemented by\r\neffective response mechanisms, to ensure successful\r\npeacekeeping deployment.\r\nThe provision of adequate resources is vital for\r\neffective and successful peacekeeping. The proposal to\r\nformulate, through the Security Council, clear criteria with\r\na more predictable basis for determining when to support\r\nthe deployment of peacekeeping operations should enhance\r\nthe role of the United Nations in the area of peacekeeping\r\nand would ensure that the United Nations deals with\r\nconflicts in an effective and decisive manner.\r\nSouth Africa supports the Secretary-General’s plea for\r\ncontributions to the OAU Peace Fund, as generous\r\ncontributions to it would lead to the enhancement of\r\nAfrica’s capability to operate in peace missions by\r\nproviding the necessary means for capacity-building.\r\nThe problem of refugees is mind-boggling. In this\r\nconnection, the practical recommendations regarding\r\nrefugee assistance are welcome, as such assistance would\r\ncontribute to enhancing the professionalism of public\r\nofficials.\r\nThe appraisal of humanitarian assistance, of its\r\nimperatives and delivery systems and of the link between\r\nemergency assistance for reconstruction and development is\r\nimportant. Humanitarian assistance is directed at people in\r\ndire situations of want, caused either by natural phenomena\r\nor through man-made situations.\r\nSouth Africa would like to underline the need for all\r\nparties, particularly in areas of conflict, to observe\r\ninternationally accepted standards of conduct and not to\r\nhinder such assistance from reaching those for whom it is\r\ndestined.\r\nAt their recent summit in Durban, the Heads of State\r\nor Government of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\ncommended the Security Council for establishing a\r\nfollow-up mechanism to implement within its competence\r\nthe recommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport and encouraged the Council to pursue its efforts in\r\nthis regard. They further recommended that the General\r\nAssembly, the United Nations system, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and other appropriate bodies should also\r\nconsider the report and follow up its recommendations.\r\nSouth Africa is committed to contributing in efforts\r\ntowards the eradication of the causes of conflict and for\r\nsustainable development in our continent.\r\nMr. Burleigh (United States of America): More than\r\na year ago, under the leadership of the United States, the\r\nSecurity Council held its first ever ministerial meeting on\r\nAfrica. Our goals were clear: to create a new and lasting\r\npartnership between Africa and the international\r\ncommunity for resolving conflict, to promote democracy\r\nand respect for human rights, and to accelerate the\r\nbuilding of political stability and Africa’s integration into\r\nthe global economy. Since then, the Security Council has\r\nstudied the thoughtful and incisive report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, prepared at the request of that ministerial\r\nmeeting. The Council’s working group is considering how\r\nbest the Security Council can take action on those issues\r\nthat fall within its authority.\r\nAfrica offers many examples of the best kind of\r\ncooperation between national leaders and the United\r\nNations in achieving a common goal. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report makes clear, this cooperation extends far\r\nbeyond the issues of peace and security that occupy the\r\nSecurity Council. In areas such as development, food\r\nsecurity, health, humanitarian aid and electoral assistance,\r\nthe partnership between Africa and the United Nations\r\nhas been close and fruitful. The United States is\r\ncommitted to that partnership and will continue to do its\r\npart, as we join together in taking on the opportunities\r\nand the challenges outlined in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport.\r\nI am pleased to note that the United States agrees\r\nwith the findings of the Secretary-General’s report. In\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nfact, recommendations in the report closely mirror the\r\nprogrammes and priorities of the United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development, as well as the initiatives\r\nannounced by President Clinton in his Partnership for\r\nEconomic Growth and Opportunity in Africa. The United\r\nStates is committed to strengthening our relationship with\r\nthe people of Africa, and we consider United Nations\r\nagencies to be among our most important partners in this\r\neffort.\r\nWhen President Clinton travelled to six African\r\nnations this past April, he heard first-hand about the efforts\r\nand accomplishments of the African people in writing a\r\nnew chapter in the history of their continent. He met with\r\neconomic leaders and business people who made clear in\r\nno uncertain terms that Africa is open for business. He saw\r\nthe natural and physical wonders of Africa and heard first-\r\nhand how these essential resources are being preserved for\r\nfuture generations. He met with the survivors of Rwanda’s\r\ngenocide as they undertook the tasks of rebuilding and\r\nreconciliation. And he talked directly with the African\r\npeople as they shared with him their dreams and aspirations\r\nfor the future and for the future of their children.\r\nThe United States is heartened by the enormous\r\nprogress that African nations and African people are\r\nmaking. Just a few years ago, there were only five\r\ndemocracies in Africa. Today, democracy is taking root\r\nacross Africa, from Botswana and Mozambique to Ghana\r\nand Benin. On the economic front, more and more African\r\ncountries are reaping the benefits of free markets, foreign\r\ninvestment and open economies.\r\nUnfortunately, not all the news is good. From the\r\nEritrean-Ethiopian border to Central and southern Africa,\r\nnations that were planting the seeds of peace, good\r\ngovernment and sustainable development are tragically\r\nreturning to the violence and conflict that plagued their\r\nnations in the past. Critical opportunities for rebuilding civil\r\nsociety, furthering economic and political development and\r\ncontributing to regional peace and security are being lost.\r\nThe United States is committed to helping resolve\r\nthese conflicts. Of course, each nation is primarily\r\nresponsible for creating its own framework for democracy,\r\ndevelopment and peace. However, we will join with our\r\ncolleagues in the United Nations to help where we can, not\r\nonly in the Security Council, but also in the General\r\nAssembly and other appropriate United Nations bodies\r\nwhich can play a critical role in resolving conflict.\r\nAlong the same lines, the United States believes that\r\nregional and subregional organizations have a critical role\r\nto play in resolving and preserving stability in Africa. In\r\nrecent years, the United States has contributed to the\r\ncrisis-management capability of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, as well as to subregional organizations, in\r\nsupport of African efforts to end conflicts in their midst.\r\nIn addition, our African Crisis Response Initiative,\r\nlike similar efforts by France and the United Kingdom, is\r\nhelping a new generation of African soldiers enhance its\r\npeacekeeping capability. We strongly urge the\r\ninternational community to continue to assist Africa’s\r\nregional and subregional organizations as they work to\r\nshape a new destiny for Africa’s people that is free of\r\ndiscord and violence.\r\nTo be sure, lasting peace and security must go hand\r\nin hand with political and economic development and\r\nwith good governance under the rule of law. As economic\r\nopportunity spreads, so too will the prospects for a\r\nsustained and lasting peace. Simply put, the cycle of\r\nviolence must be replaced by a cycle of opportunity.\r\nWe share the view of the Secretary-General that the\r\ninternational community must do more to broaden\r\neconomic opportunities for all Africans. Africa wants and\r\nneeds the world’s trade, investment and economic\r\nengagement. And, as a number of African leaders who are\r\nopening their markets to investment and trade are\r\ndiscovering, that remains the most successful and\r\nabundant path to sustainable development. Today, the\r\nUnited States is Africa’s largest single export market,\r\nhaving taken in $16 billion in African goods and services\r\nin 1997. Our exports to Africa totalled more than $6\r\nbillion in 1997. It is our goal to ensure that these numbers\r\nincrease in the future.\r\nPresident Clinton remains committed to working\r\nwith Congress to restore United States assistance for\r\nAfrica to its historic levels. The United States also\r\nbelieves that the building of technical capacity is critically\r\nimportant for Africa’s development. We remain hopeful\r\nthat efforts in the Development Assistance Committee of\r\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment will help us meet the goal of ensuring that\r\nat least 50 per cent of our assistance is spent in Africa. In\r\naddition, our Overseas Private Investment Corporation\r\nwill remain an important element for promoting\r\ninvestment in the emerging markets of Africa.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nAs the Secretary-General notes in his report, there is\r\nstill a need for international humanitarian assistance for\r\nAfrica, to help alleviate the devastating effects of conflict.\r\nWe support the proposal of the Executive Committee on\r\nHumanitarian Assistance to define a set of common\r\nprinciples for the conditions under which humanitarian\r\nassistance will be delivered.\r\nWe also agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\ninternational community must do more, through the World\r\nHealth Organization and other United Nations and\r\ninternational bodies, to stop the spread of infectious disease.\r\nFor far too many nations in Africa, the proliferation of\r\ndeadly diseases is causing not only despair for individuals,\r\nbut economic dislocation for their societies. That is why the\r\nUnited States is working to control the spread of diseases\r\nsuch as HIV/AIDS, malaria and dengue fever across the\r\ncontinent.\r\nAfrica is rich in natural resources, but its most\r\nimportant resource is its people. President Clinton has long\r\nspoken of the critical importance of education to develop\r\nhuman resources as a stepping stone to social development\r\nand economic prosperity. That is nowhere more evident\r\nthan in Africa, where poverty and political instability are\r\nkeeping too many children away from the classroom. In\r\nAfrica last April, President Clinton announced the\r\nEducation for Development and Democracy Initiative,\r\nwhich seeks to improve the quality of African education at\r\nall levels, with particular attention to the education of girls.\r\nOf course, if Africa is to truly move forward, it cannot\r\ndo so with one hand tied behind its back. Unfortunately, the\r\noften suffocating debt burdens under which many African\r\ncountries operate are having exactly that effect. The United\r\nStates is a strong supporter of comprehensive debt relief,\r\nincluding through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\nInitiative. Under this initiative, the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and other multilateral\r\ninstitutions, in conjunction with official creditors, are\r\nproviding coordinated debt relief to poor countries with\r\nunsustainable debt burdens.\r\nThe United States agrees with the thrust of the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations on the issue of debt.\r\nAnd we reiterate our call for creditors to follow the\r\nexample of the World Bank and the Paris Club in providing\r\ninterim debt relief to support reforms to date, rather than\r\ndelaying all debt relief until a future completion of an entire\r\nreform package.\r\nWhen President Clinton journeyed to Africa last\r\nMarch he told a crowd of nearly half a million people in\r\nAccra, Ghana,\r\n“One hundred years from now, your grandchildren\r\nand mine will look back and say this was the\r\nbeginning of a new African renaissance.”\r\nBut that dream will only become a reality if each and\r\nevery nation gathered here today joins together with the\r\nAfrican people in helping to bring peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment to their continent.\r\nMr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The report of the Secretary-General\r\ncontains a comprehensive analysis of the sources of\r\nconflict situations in Africa, which, by undermining the\r\npolitical and socio-economic stability of entire regions,\r\nresult in loss of life and human suffering and hamper the\r\nfulfilment of African peoples’ aspirations for peace and\r\nprogress. The short- and long-term measures proposed by\r\nthe Secretary-General aimed at preventing and settling\r\narmed conflicts and humanitarian disasters and at\r\nstrengthening peace and stability on the continent\r\npresuppose the use of the entire range of instruments\r\navailable to the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council is already undertaking concrete\r\nsteps within the framework of its competence to develop\r\nthe recommendations of the Secretary-General. The\r\nactivities of the special Working Group established by the\r\nCouncil, and its subgroups, made it possible to reach\r\nagreement on substantive decisions regarding support for\r\nregional and subregional initiatives in the areas of conflict\r\nprevention, the maintenance of peace and enhancing the\r\neffectiveness of arms embargoes. The question of\r\nenhancing Africa’s peacekeeping potential has also been\r\nconsidered.\r\nThe Security Council’s ministerial-level meeting held\r\non 24 September 1998 gave a preliminary summary of the\r\nresults of this work. Russia believes that it is important to\r\ncontinue to develop these questions. In addition, there is\r\na need to enhance the specific targeting of sanctions and\r\nto agree on specific criteria for the development of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. We are in favour of\r\ndeveloping the recommendations of the Secretary-General\r\nregarding humanitarian assistance, post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding, good governance and sustainable development.\r\nWhenever an aspect of these recommendations goes\r\nbeyond the competence of the Security Council, there is\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\na need for agreed actions by various bodies and agencies of\r\nthe United Nations system for the practical implementation\r\nof the objectives contained in the report. One of the real\r\npossibilities for establishing closer ties and coordination\r\nbetween United Nations bodies and the political, social,\r\neconomic and humanitarian aspects of the problem is to\r\nrevive the dormant Article 65 of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, on cooperation between the Security Council and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\nWithout a solid and long-term settlement of conflicts\r\nit will not be possible to ensure real access by the countries\r\nof Africa to the mainstream of sustainable and dynamic\r\ndevelopment and their full-fledged integration into the\r\nglobal economy. This will require a comprehensive\r\napproach to resolving the problems on the African\r\ncontinent. One of the key components of such a strategy\r\nmust be the establishment of a system to prevent and settle\r\nconflicts and provide a comprehensive solution to problems\r\nof post-conflict rehabilitation. Here there will be a need for\r\nfurther joint efforts by both the friends of Africa and\r\nAfricans themselves to break the vicious circle of\r\ninsufficient development, social and inter-ethnic problems,\r\npolitical and military instability, conflicts and the\r\nbreakdown of development programmes.\r\nWe highly value the role of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity in preventing and settling conflicts, providing\r\nfor sustainable development and solving serious\r\nhumanitarian problems. We also value the fruitful results of\r\nits activities in the area of regional integration and\r\nadvancement of the African Economic Community.\r\nRussia believes that the responsibility for development\r\nand for implementing an effective economic policy lies first\r\nand foremost with the countries themselves. At the same\r\ntime, under globalization it is impossible to do without\r\ninternational cooperation in order to establish favourable\r\nconditions for development. This is particularly relevant\r\nwith regard to African States, many of which cannot\r\nindependently break the vicious circle of socio-economic\r\nproblems, regardless of their keen desire to do so.\r\nWe support the recommendations contained in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General regarding the need for an\r\nanalysis of means to render technical assistance to the\r\nAfrican countries in order to promote the consolidation of\r\ntheir own potential, to take effective measures to reduce the\r\ndebt burden of the African countries and to provide\r\nconditions for access of African products to the markets of\r\nother regions.\r\nTo resolve the problems of Africa, there is a need to\r\nimprove coordination between the efforts of donors acting\r\nat the bilateral and multilateral levels. There is also a\r\nneed to coordinate the various initiatives aimed at the\r\ndevelopment of the African continent, such as the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s, the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative for Africa, the Tokyo International Conference\r\non African Development and the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\r\nfor the 1990s. In our view, a leading role in such\r\ncoordination should be played by the relevant\r\nintergovernmental and inter-agency machinery of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nTo resolve the social and economic problems of\r\nAfrica, the Secretary-General’s appeal is now more\r\nrelevant than ever with regard to the need for a\r\ncomprehensive approach to the challenges of globalization\r\nby taking all factors into account — not only financial\r\nand economic ones, but also social, political and cultural\r\nones.\r\nIn his autobiography, A Long Walk to Freedom,\r\nNelson Mandela noted that freedom is not only casting\r\noff of chains, but also the aspiration to respect the\r\nfreedom of others. This theme also recurs in the sections\r\nof the report of the Secretary-General that are devoted to\r\ngood governance and securing respect for human rights\r\nand the rule of law, which constitute the necessary\r\ncomponents for any efforts designed to make peace\r\nlasting. Suffice it here to recall the experience of South\r\nAfrica in overcoming the legacy of apartheid, the African\r\nCharter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the\r\ncontribution of African delegations to drawing up\r\nfundamental international treaties in the sphere of human\r\nrights.\r\nWe are confident that, through genuine partnership,\r\nAfrica will be able to redress the past inheritance of\r\ninjustice and enmity with a culture of human rights.\r\nThe Russian Federation greatly values its traditional\r\nfriendly ties with Africa. We note with great satisfaction\r\nthe growing role of African States in world affairs and\r\ntheir contribution to international economic integration\r\nand to strengthening the universal security system. Russia\r\nintends to render all possible assistance to resolve\r\nproblems on the African continent. Africa has been and\r\nremains a focus of our constant attention.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nIn addition to action within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations, we are now considering alternatives for\r\nexpanding our practical participation in strengthening\r\nAfrican peacekeeping, above all in such areas as\r\ntransportation, technical servicing for humanitarian activities\r\nand the training of rescuers and personnel involved in\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nUnderstanding the concern of many African countries\r\nfor the problem of uncleared mines, we are ready to render\r\nexpert assistance on demining.\r\nIn addition, we believe that it is advisable to develop\r\nand expand our positive experience in multilateral\r\ncooperation on the African continent. We believe that a\r\ngood example of such cooperation could be, in particular,\r\nthe Russian-Norwegian project for establishing automotive\r\nschools. We are open to proposals for other possible joint\r\nprojects that could make use of Russia’s technical and\r\nintellectual potential.\r\nAs Russian President Boris Yeltsin noted in his\r\nmessage to heads of State or Government and to the\r\npeoples and the countries of Africa:\r\n“For the Russian Federation, close ties with Africa are\r\nnot only a glorious page of history; this is the reality\r\nof today. We are firmly committed to an\r\nintensification of interaction with the States of the\r\nAfrican continent in the most varied fields — from\r\npolitics to the economy and culture.”\r\nMr. Akunwafor (Nigeria): I have the honour to speak\r\nin my capacity as Chairman of the African Group for the\r\nmonth of October 1998 and on behalf of member States of\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), made up of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde,\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nLiberia, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger, Nigeria, Senegal,\r\nSierra Leone and Togo. The Group is speaking on this all-\r\nimportant subject, which was introduced into this year’s\r\nagenda at our collective request. Permit me to express the\r\nappreciation of the group of ECOWAS ambassadors at the\r\nUnited Nations to the General Committee for its decision to\r\nconsider the subject in all its ramifications at this plenary\r\nmeeting.\r\nAt an earlier forum, we had cause to commend the\r\nSecurity Council for its laudable initiative to commission\r\nthis report, which was submitted to it in April by the\r\nSecretary-General. This action on its part to focus attention\r\non the need for a renewed and concerted international effort\r\nto promote peace, stability and sustainable economic\r\ngrowth and development is clearly unprecedented.\r\nCandid, insightful and appropriately packaged\r\nanalyses of the African predicament are not lacking. As\r\na matter of fact, we already have a plethora of that, with\r\nsupporting figures and statistics. Rather, there has been a\r\nshortage of concrete actions to address the socio-\r\neconomic problems of the continent. We would like to\r\njudge the international community by its actions in that\r\ndirection rather than by its declarations. As African\r\ncountries embark on the arduous task of building\r\ndemocratic institutions and instituting good governance\r\nand economic reforms, the international community\r\nshould come forward to encourage and support these\r\npositive tendencies in a practical manner.\r\nWhen the Security Council considered their subject\r\nlast April, it came to the conclusion that the challenges in\r\nAfrica demanded a comprehensive and coordinated\r\nresponse. On its part, it had set up an open-ended ad hoc\r\nworking group to review those aspects that touch on the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The ad\r\nhoc working group was expected to come up with specific\r\nproposals for concrete action by the Security Council. It\r\nhad also, at the same time, expressed the hope that other\r\nrelevant bodies of the United Nations, including the\r\nGeneral Assembly and other intergovernmental\r\norganizations, should equally consider the subject matter\r\nand take appropriate action within their areas of\r\ncompetence.\r\nEconomic difficulties are one of the root causes of\r\ninstability in Africa. It is therefore essential that African\r\ncountries are assisted to overcome these difficulties. The\r\nscale of poverty and misery is intolerably high. The\r\ncontinent deserves all assistance to help it to combat\r\npoverty.\r\nEven though the Assembly proclaimed the period\r\nfrom 1997 to 2006 as the first United Nations Decade for\r\nthe Eradication of Poverty, the root causes of poverty\r\nmust be addressed through concrete action in the core\r\nareas of capacity-building, health, food security, the\r\nenvironment, clean water and sanitation, among others.\r\nTo achieve the goal of eradicating poverty in Africa\r\nrequires strategies to expedite economic growth in the\r\nregion as elsewhere. Unfortunately, while many\r\nGovernments endorse poverty eradication as a primary\r\ninternational goal, they have not always translated this\r\ncommitment into tangible actions.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nFor instance, the combined official development\r\nassistance of donor countries peaked in the early 1990s and\r\nhas continued to record a steady decline since then. Official\r\ndevelopment assistance decreased from 0.34 per cent of\r\ndonors’ gross national product in 1990-1992 to 0.27 per\r\ncent in 1993-1995, and has continued to shrink since then.\r\nThis actual performance contrasts with the target of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national product agreed to at the 1992 Earth\r\nSummit in Rio. Only a few countries — the Nordic\r\ncountries and the Netherlands — have consistently met this\r\n0.7 per cent target.\r\nIn spite of the different debt initiatives, the external\r\ndebt situation of African countries constitutes a serious\r\nconstraint to the development of the continent. Debt\r\nservicing eats away large portions of hard-earned foreign\r\nexchange. For most of the countries in the region, the share\r\nof Government revenue devoted to debt servicing is larger\r\nthan the budget for the social sector — education and\r\nhealth combined. Even so, the total debt stock continues to\r\nrise owing to the capitalization of accrued interests. Total\r\ndebt forgiveness needs to be given more serious\r\nconsideration at this stage to allow the continent to address\r\nits developmental agenda in all earnestness. The recent\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, sponsored\r\nby the International Monetary Fund (IMF), should be made\r\nmore flexible. The six-year period of sustained IMF-\r\napproved macroeconomic reforms before eligibility is\r\nconsidered far too long.\r\nAt this juncture, the role of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions as catalysts for the socio-economic development\r\nof the continent becomes crucial. They need to understand\r\nthe efficacy of “peace-friendly” reform programmes which\r\ndo not undermine the ability of beneficiary countries to\r\nfulfil their basic responsibilities to their people in such\r\nareas as health, education and overall welfare.\r\nOther challenges facing the continent include the\r\nadverse effects of liberalization and the globalization of the\r\nworld economy and its marginalization of our weak\r\neconomies, and the unequal terms of trade which place our\r\ncountries at a disadvantage, to mention just a few. The\r\nAfrican Group will introduce a draft resolution before the\r\nAssembly that, we hope, will address the issues from the\r\neconomic and social perspectives. It is our desire to enter\r\nthe next millennium as equal partners and free agents. We\r\nexpect our development partners to commit themselves this\r\ntime around to the attainment of the goal of eliminating the\r\ncauses of conflict in Africa and promoting sustainable\r\npeace and economic growth on the continent. If we can\r\ntogether muster the necessary political will to act, then we\r\nare sure to leave a positive legacy of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Norway welcomes the fact\r\nthat the General Assembly has the opportunity to discuss\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on causes of conflict and\r\npromotion of peace and development in Africa. With a\r\nnumber of armed conflicts dominating the political scene\r\nin several regions of Africa, it is of crucial importance\r\nthat the international community, together with the\r\nAfrican countries, discuss ways and means to confront the\r\nchallenges. This regards not only the field of economic\r\ngrowth and development, good governance, democracy\r\nand human rights, but also, and not least, security and\r\nconflict prevention.\r\nA correct analysis of the current complex situation\r\nin a number of countries and regions in Africa is essential\r\nif our discussion is to result in specific action. We believe\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report is well founded and\r\nprovides us with tools with which we can address some\r\nof the primary challenges facing a majority of the African\r\npopulation. We are pleased to see that since its\r\npublication in April this year, a number of\r\nrecommendations have been followed up by the Security\r\nCouncil. We also note with satisfaction the follow-up\r\nactivities that have been initiated by the United Nations\r\nSecretariat.\r\nIn our view the simple word “will” is a key word in\r\nthe report. Norway fully agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral when he emphasizes the importance of having the\r\npolitical will to address the many challenges facing\r\nAfrica. We believe that this political will must be\r\nmanifested both by the African countries — whose\r\nleaders must put the interests of their own people first —\r\nand by the international community, through the creation\r\nof an international economic environment conducive to\r\nAfrica’s development aspirations.\r\nIt is imperative to bear in mind the linkage between\r\nsustainable economic growth and development, on the one\r\nhand, and political stability, good governance and\r\ndemocracy on the other. During recent years we have\r\nseen signs of positive and promising economic\r\ndevelopment trends in most African countries. We have,\r\nhowever, also witnessed severe setbacks. The continent as\r\na whole still lags behind the target of 6 per cent growth\r\nin gross national product per year set by the United\r\nNations in the New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s. In addition, the financial crises that\r\noriginated in Asia are having serious repercussions in\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nAfrica, such as lower commodity prices and the lack of\r\ndynamic markets.\r\nAfrica’s share of global trade has been reduced during\r\nthe last decade. When goods and capital are bought and\r\nsold with the push of a button, national borders and\r\nregulations in many countries lose their previous role. It is\r\ntherefore crucial to integrate African economies into the\r\nglobal trading regime and to work for more just terms of\r\ntrade on behalf of the poor countries. Norway contributes\r\nsubstantially in this effort, both bilaterally and\r\nmultilaterally, through the World Trade Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development and\r\nother appropriate agencies.\r\nOne of the main obstacles to economic and social\r\ndevelopment in Africa is the debt burden. Norway has\r\nrecently launched a comprehensive national debt-relief\r\nstrategy. The aim is to reduce the debt burden of 22 of the\r\npoorest and most heavily indebted countries, of which 18\r\nare African. The strategy includes concrete proposals on\r\nhow we can reinforce and further utilize existing\r\nmultilateral mechanisms. The most important new scheme\r\nin the strategy is to provide unilateral debt reductions on a\r\ncase-by-case basis additional to the reductions made under\r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\r\noperations.\r\nNorway is concerned about the international trend of\r\nreduced official development assistance disbursements. This\r\ntrend applies in particular to Africa, where foreign direct\r\ninvestment also is low. African countries will for the\r\nforeseeable future still be dependent on official\r\ndevelopment assistance in order to implement their\r\neconomic and social reform programmes. It is a challenge\r\nto us all to counteract the increasing donor fatigue in\r\nrelation to Africa. It is a regrettable fact that the\r\nindustrialized countries are increasingly distancing\r\nthemselves from the agreed United Nations target of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national product for development purposes.\r\nNorway has been well above this target for decades, and\r\nmy Government is currently working on a plan to increase\r\nNorwegian development assistance to 1 per cent of gross\r\nnational product in the years ahead. Special emphasis will\r\nbe on increased cooperation with our African partners,\r\npoverty alleviation, improved delivery of social services and\r\ndebt reduction.\r\nAfrican countries continue to be the main recipients of\r\nNorwegian official development assistance. It is my\r\nGovernment’s intention to disburse at least half of the total\r\nbilateral official development assistance to Africa. The\r\ngreater part of the multilateral assistance will be\r\nchannelled through organizations with a major\r\ncommitment in Africa. The poorest countries will be\r\ngiven priority also by means of earmarked contributions\r\nto the multilateral organizations. Development assistance\r\nto the least developed countries will receive special\r\nattention.\r\nFrom experience we have seen how short-term\r\nhumanitarian assistance and rehabilitation have\r\ncontributed positively in solving conflicts and stabilizing\r\npost-conflict situations. However, this kind of aid does\r\nlittle to alleviate the long-term causes of political\r\ninstability and unrest. Poverty and human suffering rank\r\nhigh among such causes, and the resulting conflicts often\r\ninduce even more poverty and suffering. It is of the\r\nutmost importance that developing countries themselves\r\nrealize that they must come to grips with the dimensions\r\nand causes of poverty in their countries, develop proactive\r\npoverty reduction strategies and allocate resources to\r\nimplement such strategies. In today’s adverse economic\r\nclimate, demonstrating the will to fight poverty and to\r\nachieve sustainable development is perhaps the only kind\r\nof attitude that can inspire donors to come up with more\r\naid.\r\nThere can be no economic development without\r\nhuman development. An integrated and inalienable part of\r\nhuman development is respect for all human rights: civil,\r\ncultural, economic, political and social. The human rights\r\naspect has played, and will continue to play, an important\r\nrole in Norwegian development assistance. Norway\r\ntherefore welcomes the increased awareness of human\r\nrights aspects shown by its partner countries in Africa.\r\nNorwegian development assistance has in part been\r\ndirected towards assisting African countries to fulfil the\r\nobligations undertaken in this field.\r\nA vital part of economic development is active\r\nparticipation and, through this, ownership by the people.\r\nIn order to achieve such participation, people need\r\nrelevant information. An environment of open debate\r\nmust be promoted. It is the responsibility of the\r\nauthorities in any country to safeguard human rights for\r\nits population. Respect for human rights is a prerequisite\r\nfor social and economic development, and studies\r\nconclude that economic development projects are more\r\nsuccessful where civil and political rights are respected.\r\nThis demonstrates that in practice a boundary between\r\ncivil and political rights on the one hand and economic\r\nand social rights on the other hand is artificial. They are\r\nin fact mutually reinforcing.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nThe protection of refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons forced to leave their homes because of conflicts\r\nmust remain a priority for the international community at\r\nlarge. The critical situation for internally displaced persons\r\nin several African countries illustrates the need for\r\nprotection. The Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees has expressed deep concern\r\nabout the violations of the principle of protection that have\r\noccurred in the Great Lakes and other regions. We share\r\nthis concern, and we would like to see a firm commitment\r\non the part of the countries concerned to the\r\nimplementation of these international principles.\r\nThe Regional Ministerial Meeting on Refugee Issues,\r\nco-chaired by the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees and the Secretary-General of the Organization for\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) that took place in Kampala in May\r\nthis year focused on the need to reconcile protection\r\nprinciples with the legitimate concern for State security. We\r\nregard this as a positive initiative, and we hope the\r\ndiscussions and follow-up efforts will bring progress in this\r\nundertaking. Indeed, we need a stronger partnership\r\nbetween the United Nations, the OAU and subregional\r\nbodies in this area.\r\nThere is an urgent need to strengthen political will and\r\nthe capacity of the international community for conflict\r\nprevention and crisis management. This must encompass\r\nmore than the provision of assistance in situations of forced\r\ndisplacement. What is needed is an improved and\r\ninnovative, coordinated international approach that would\r\nprovide a better link between political, military and\r\nhumanitarian players on the one hand, and relief and\r\ndevelopment on the other.\r\nA major step to improve the situation for the African\r\npeoples and to maintain peace and stability would be to\r\nstop the unlawful use and excessive accumulation of small\r\narms. The donor community has an important role to play\r\nhere in supporting such initiatives from African countries.\r\nSupport could be provided in a number of areas, from\r\nrestructuring the national security sector to collection and\r\ndestruction of small arms. We commend the establishment\r\nof a moratorium on small arms for interested West African\r\ncountries, and we support the Secretary-General in his\r\nappeal to all African countries to participate in the United\r\nNations Register of Conventional Arms.\r\nLandmines constitute another serious obstacle to post-\r\nconflict reconstruction. We urge all Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations to sign and ratify the Ottawa Convention.\r\nLikewise, we emphasize the need for adequate resources for\r\nmine-clearing activities. For its part, Norway has already\r\nstated its intention to contribute $120 million over the\r\nnext five years for this task.\r\nIn a situation where Africa is ridden by conflicts, old\r\nand new, it is also the time to focus on the responsibility\r\nand will of the continent’s leaders to make peace and\r\nseek reconciliation.\r\nIn conclusion, let me repeat that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report provides us with the analysis and tools\r\nwe need. Now it is up to all of us, the African countries\r\nand donor community alike, to demonstrate the political\r\nand economic will to make a difference for the people of\r\nAfrica.\r\nMr. Al-Najaar (United Arab Emirates)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): On behalf of the United\r\nArab Emirates, I am honoured to extend to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan our thanks and appreciation for his\r\nreport and for the valuable and comprehensive statement\r\nhe delivered this morning regarding the causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. This clearly reflects an objective\r\nanalysis of the situation in the African continent.\r\nSuccessive meetings have been held by the Security\r\nCouncil — the latest only a few days ago — at the level\r\nof foreign minister, and a large number of delegates\r\nparticipated today in the discussion of this important item.\r\nThis reflects the collective international concern vis-à-vis\r\nthe information contained in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. In that report he clarified the external and\r\ninternal causes leading to the deterioration of African\r\nnational institutions, the continuing decline of the rates of\r\neconomic growth, investment and the gross national\r\nproduct. The report also referred to the problems of the\r\naccumulation of debt, widespread poverty, unemployment,\r\nilliteracy, displacement and epidemics, which have\r\nbecome rampant in large segments of the population of\r\nAfrica. This is in addition to other threats arising from the\r\nhotbeds of tension and the bloody armed conflicts in\r\nsome areas.\r\nNonetheless, a relative détente has taken place and\r\nhas had a limited impact on the situation in this continent\r\nin recent years. This was demonstrated in the\r\nconsolidation of aspects of democracy, reform and\r\nsustainable development, and it showed that there is a\r\nsincere will, on the part of some of Africa’s States and\r\npeoples, to emerge from the crises and achieve prosperity\r\nand stability. However, most of the areas of Africa do\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nstill suffer from the negative impact of the socio-economic,\r\npolitical and environmental decline, and we can see that the\r\nsocieties of Africa have endured this, increasingly, year in\r\nand year out, from the beginning of the 1980s until now.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is profoundly concerned\r\nvis-à-vis this sustained African reality because that reality\r\nreflects on stability and on regional and international\r\nsecurity. Therefore, we consider that containing this\r\nsituation is a collective responsibility which cannot be\r\nundertaken in the absence of regional and international\r\ninterdependence and solidarity. We also reiterate our\r\nsupport for the proposals in the report that call for the\r\nactivation of peacekeeping, as well as humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment assistance programmes and post-conflict\r\npeace-building in African areas of hotbeds of tension.\r\nWe reiterate the importance of mobilizing local,\r\nregional and international efforts for the enhancement and\r\ndevelopment of African human resources, as well as for the\r\nprovision of funds for financing and assistance to enable\r\nthe societies of the African continent to undertake the\r\nnecessary reform for their developmental structures. We\r\nalso consider that this common world approach requires for\r\nits realization the following priority steps.\r\nFirst, the warring African factions must summon the\r\nnecessary political will to implement a ceasefire, stop\r\nbloodshed and respond to the peaceful endeavours for\r\nreconciliation, be it in the national, bilateral or regional\r\nframework, in accordance with the Charter and the rules of\r\ninternational law.\r\nSecondly, the international community must devise\r\nand implement a comprehensive and objective programme\r\nto curb the flow and transfer of arms to the areas of tension\r\nin the African continent.\r\nThirdly, steps must be taken to enhance and develop\r\nthe framework for cooperation and coordination between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of African Unity\r\nand its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\r\nand Resolution, as well as other relevant institutional\r\narrangements. Here, the goal should be the development of\r\na plan of action that is more capable of propelling all the\r\nwarring African parties towards implementing military\r\ndisengagement and ceasefire agreements, thus creating a\r\npeaceful environment conducive to national reconciliation.\r\nFourthly, we must devise an international strategy to\r\nrespond to early warnings that is more effective and\r\ndeveloped, and thus capable of preventing crises in Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to state that dealing with\r\nand containing the grave challenges which the African\r\ncontinent faces now may be an arduous task, but it is not\r\nimpossible. Let us therefore firm up the international\r\ncommitment to providing support and assistance to the\r\ncountries and peoples of that continent and in order to\r\nhelp it achieve its lofty goals and secure improved\r\nintegration into the concomitant process of socio-\r\neconomic globalization.\r\nMr. Larraín (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nDespite the geographical distance involved, Chile feels\r\nvery close to the African continent, the progress of which\r\nit has followed since before the onset of the\r\ndecolonization process, in which the countries of Latin\r\nAmerica played a supporting role that I wish to recall.\r\nIndeed, in the Second World War, the nations of\r\nLatin America developed a particular sense of what the\r\nworld could be after the conflict. In those years, the\r\npeoples of Asia and Africa were subject to colonial\r\nregimes and unable to participate directly in the\r\npreparatory negotiations on the text of the United Nations\r\nCharter. Their hopes were vested in the commitments that\r\nmight be given with respect to colonial territories. Latin\r\nAmerica assumed that responsibility in anticipated\r\nrepresentation of what would become the third world.\r\nMore than 50 years have passed since then and over\r\n50 independent African States are now Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. Chile is their friend and in some it has\r\nresident diplomatic missions. We must recognize that the\r\nUnited Nations makes it much easier for countries such as\r\nours to maintain relations with those African States in\r\nwhich we do not have resident diplomatic relations and\r\nwith which we do not have significant cultural and\r\neconomic ties.\r\nDuring its membership of the Security Council in\r\n1996 and 1997, Chile witnessed from that organ’s\r\nperspective a number of tragedies suffered by Africa. The\r\ngeographical distance between Chile and Africa and the\r\nfact that we do not have global or strategic interests in\r\nthat continent were the very factors that allowed us to\r\nplay an active and independent role for peace and\r\ndevelopment there. We recall with pleasure the ministerial\r\nmeeting of the Security Council on Africa that was held\r\non 25 September 1997. We have had the opportunity to\r\nconsider the Secretary-General’s report, which we value\r\nvery highly.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nIf the international community is to be able to use the\r\ntools that are best suited to a proper analysis of the\r\nconflicts in Africa, it is absolutely necessary to identify the\r\ncauses at play.\r\nIn many cases, the colonial system in Africa lasted\r\nless than a century. However, it entirely reshaped the\r\npolitical environment, social structures and economic\r\nsystems. It is common knowledge that the borders drawn by\r\nthe colonial Powers often did not correspond to ethnic\r\nrealities. This is a relevant factor with a significant impact\r\nas a source of conflict.\r\nIt should be recognized, however, that the countries of\r\nAfrica which inherited this legacy understood that there was\r\nno system capable of offering a political and territorial\r\norganization better tailored to African realities. Moreover,\r\nthere is an understandable aversion among the current\r\nindependent States to any threat to their territorial unity.\r\nThat is why there have been few changes in the African\r\ngeopolitical map since the completion of the decolonization\r\nprocess.\r\nAnother important and related element is the cultural\r\nimprint of the colonial system on Africa. As a country with\r\na colonial past, we are certain that that system imposed\r\npositive and negative models alike on the local populations.\r\nUnfortunately, the imposition of such patterns often meant\r\nthat endogenous elements which might have lent harmony\r\nand stability to the social system were discarded or\r\ndiscounted.\r\nIn Africa, the traditional political and social\r\norganization stresses the group and group solidarity. Often,\r\nhuman relations are dominated by humanitarian\r\nconsiderations unknown in the Western world. We feel it\r\nimportant that African thinking be given real weight on the\r\nAfrican political scene so as to allow the ongoing\r\nestablishment of stable and legitimate democratic\r\nGovernments based on African humanism and profound\r\nrespect for the fundamental rights of individuals.\r\nAs elected members of the Security Council in 1996\r\nand 1997, we were able to appreciate how Africans\r\nthemselves were increasingly addressing African problems\r\nthrough various subregional schemes backed by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity. This very positive\r\nphenomenon was supported by the international community.\r\nWe believe it essential for the United Nations to cooperate\r\nadequately with those subregional groupings in handling a\r\nconflict.\r\nWe pay tribute to the countries of those groups and\r\noffer them our fullest support for Africa’s activities for\r\nAfrica. This does not mean that the world should cease to\r\nattend to their problems; on the contrary, it should be\r\nready to cooperate along the lines that Africa is laying\r\ndown.\r\nChile has been consistently concerned with the\r\nhumanitarian situation in conflict areas and believes that\r\nrespect for international humanitarian law is fundamental.\r\nIn this regard, we deplore the difficulties often\r\nencountered by international humanitarian agencies. The\r\ndisinterested and difficult work of humanitarian workers,\r\nbe they from the United Nations or the non-governmental\r\norganizations, in conflict zones is quite remarkable to all\r\nof us.\r\nOne of the main concerns of these agencies, first\r\namong which is the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), is the grave\r\nsituation of refugees on the African continent. According\r\nto UNHCR, approximately 8 million people are either\r\nrefugees or internally displaced, though less information\r\nis available on the latter.\r\nSince the main objective of the humanitarian\r\nagencies is to assist persons suffering in conflicts, they\r\nare often also the only witnesses to events in the field. It\r\nshould be noted that these agencies provided us with\r\nvaluable information for our work in the Security\r\nCouncil, and we take this opportunity to thank them. It is\r\nimportant that this kind of link between the Security\r\nCouncil and the agencies cooperating in humanitarian\r\nwork in conflict zones in Africa and the rest of the world\r\ngrow increasingly closer.\r\nI wish to reaffirm to the General Assembly what my\r\ndelegation reiterated on several occasions in the Security\r\nCouncil. When a conflict ends, a country embarks on a\r\njourney that ends when it is able to establish a stable\r\npolitical and security situation. This means that the United\r\nNations system must not disengage from a country or\r\nregion in which peace, often very fragile, has been\r\nachieved. The United Nations, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the international community should attach\r\nhigh priority to promoting a country’s social and\r\neconomic development. The Security Council must ensure\r\na fluid and coordinated link between its responsibilities\r\nand those of other United Nations development\r\ncooperation bodies. This, ultimately, is the only stable\r\nsource of peace.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\nWith respect to the post-conflict period and in the\r\ncontext of the factors giving rise to conflicts in Africa, I\r\nhave a final thought that I wish to share. It is good to keep\r\nin mind one reality that we have noted in the African\r\ncontinent. Some countries there are demonstrating great\r\neconomic vitality and thus giving the lie to many\r\npessimists’ emphasis on Africa’s difficulties in extricating\r\nitself from underdevelopment. We should watch these\r\nexperiments closely and promote them. They could be a\r\nmodel to follow. The international community’s sole wish\r\nis for human tragedies to give way to social coexistence\r\nand economic development and for the Africans themselves\r\nto appreciate with genuine optimism the awakening of a\r\nnew Africa in the coming years.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): On behalf of the delegation\r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland, I welcome this opportunity\r\nto take part in the General Assembly’s debate on the\r\nSecretary-General’s report entitled “The causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa” contained in document A/52/871.\r\nMy delegation fully aligns itself with the statements by\r\nthe representatives of Burkina Faso, on behalf of the\r\nOrganization of the African Unity (OAU), and of Namibia,\r\non behalf of the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC).\r\nThe report is indicative and provides us with a true\r\npicture of the problems Africa is facing. It also addresses\r\nrecommendations for action by the international community.\r\nSince time immemorial Africa has been besieged by\r\nmultifaceted problems which have created conflicts\r\nthroughout the continent. Some of these conflicts have\r\nproved to be of a huge and complicated nature, thus\r\nrequiring immense resources from African States\r\nthemselves to counter the effects they create. Added to\r\nthese endless crises are new conflicts which clamour\r\nequally for our attention, due to their complexity and the\r\ngrave dangers they pose.\r\nThese crises are a test of the strength of the\r\ninternational community, which more often than not must\r\nswiftly respond to the plight of the people of Africa. Africa\r\nherself has a moral obligation to lead the way forward with\r\nthe necessary political will, which though often elusive is\r\nnonetheless essential to every resolve undertaken to end the\r\ncrises.\r\nThe report sets out a practical set of recommendations\r\nfor action by the international community. In his own\r\nwords, the Secretary-General wished the report to form the\r\nbeginning of a new relationship between the United\r\nNations and Africa. He has in this spirit challenged\r\neveryone to create a new beginning that is result-oriented,\r\nproductive and meaningful.\r\nThe number of conflicts on the continent remains\r\nhigh. Conventional conflicts between nation-States have\r\nnot gone away, as evidenced by those in the Horn of\r\nAfrica and the Great Lakes region. The source of\r\ninstability is most often internal, but the nature of these\r\ncrises is such that they spread rapidly by generating and\r\nfuelling the movement of displaced persons, arms-\r\ntrafficking, ethnic strife and foreign interference. This is\r\ntrue with the developments in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo. The bloody crisis in the Congo has undone\r\nprogress achieved since President Laurent Kabila’s\r\nGovernment was installed. In Angola, the situation has\r\neluded the dreams and hopes raised by the Lusaka\r\nProtocol and is poised to drag that country back into a\r\ncivil war.\r\nOn a much more positive note, though, we are\r\nencouraged by the developments to promote a peaceful\r\nresolution of the various conflicts afflicting the continent.\r\nThe sustained efforts deployed by African countries in an\r\nattempt to contain the crises which erupted in Sierra\r\nLeone, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo are a clear testimony\r\nto Africa’s commitment to lasting peace, security and\r\nstability. In all these efforts, the OAU has endeavoured to\r\nassume its continental responsibility in a spirit of\r\ncooperation, solidarity and complementarity between the\r\ncontinental body and African subregional organizations\r\nsuch as the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) as well as SADC. Such an\r\napproach is offering real prospects for conflict\r\ncontainment and permanent conflict resolution in Africa.\r\nHowever, these initiatives need to be strengthened and\r\nsupported at the continental level and internationally in a\r\nspirit of future partnership to realize international peace\r\nand security.\r\nRegardless of how much effort we put into these\r\ncrises, the continuing illegal flow of arms is helping to\r\ntransform many tensions into armed confrontation and to\r\nmaintain a climate of insecurity. The Security Council\r\nmust continue to urge those countries that supply these\r\nweapons to show restraint and to try to enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the Council’s arms embargo. It is in this\r\nspirit that my delegation welcomes Security Council\r\nresolution 1196 (1998), concerning strengthening the\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\neffectiveness of arms embargoes in conflict situations\r\nimposed by the Council. Illicit arms flow to and within\r\nAfrica must come to an end. The international community\r\nmust come together in a coordinated and concerted manner\r\nto find a credible and effective solution to the flow of arms\r\nin our continent.\r\nMuch needs to be done to provide an environment in\r\nwhich individuals feel protected, civil society is able to\r\nflourish, and government carries out its responsibilities\r\neffectively and transparently, with adequate institutional\r\nmechanisms to ensure accountability. At the same time,\r\nguaranteeing fair and impartial enforcement of the law is\r\nindispensable for the protection of human rights. In a\r\nnutshell, this requires respecting the autonomy, integrity and\r\nindependence of the judiciary and ensuring fair and\r\nimpartial law enforcement by the State. Strengthening\r\njudicial institutions is another very important area in which\r\nthe international community can help African countries to\r\npromote good governance. Whilst Africa has evidenced all\r\nefforts towards democratization, it remains true that such a\r\nquest is dependent only upon African nations themselves,\r\nwhich are charged with the responsibility of establishing\r\nideals reflective of the African norms and cultural values.\r\nDemocratization gives people a stake in society. It\r\ngives people a sense of belonging, it gives people power\r\nand, most important of all, it makes them feel that they\r\nhave a true stake in security. Without that, lasting peace\r\nwill not be possible and sustainable development will not\r\nbe realized. Our structures within the country’s home-grown\r\nsystem of governance bears clear testimony to this. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland, under the leadership of His Majesty\r\nKing Mswati III, is built upon a system of consensus\r\nconsultation wherein all citizens are free to express their\r\nviews on how the Kingdom’s destiny should be mapped\r\nout.\r\nGood governance alone cannot ensure the inflow of\r\ninvestment and economic growth. However, once good\r\ngovernance has been firmly established, it goes without\r\nsaying that an enabling environment for investment and\r\neconomic growth must follow, for no one can be expected\r\nto invest in an unstable or insecure neighbourhood. The\r\nworld economic system is highly competitive and market-\r\nbased. It is, however, regrettable that Africa has become\r\nlargely marginalized in recent years in terms of attracting\r\nsignificant inflows of long-term foreign direct investment.\r\nIf Africa is to participate fully in the global economy,\r\npolitical and economic reforms must be carried out. It is\r\nencouraging to note, though, that many Governments are in\r\nthe process of successfully implementing necessary reforms\r\nin the areas of economic deregulation, rationalized\r\nstructures, adequate infrastructure and predictable policies.\r\nAs a result, some countries already enjoy stronger growth,\r\nand this in itself gives us reason to remain optimistic that\r\nthe very near future awaiting Africa is bright. We are\r\ngrateful to our partners in the international community for\r\nthe initiatives they have put in place for Africa’s\r\nrenaissance.\r\nClosely linked to the question of economic growth\r\nand past economic imbalances is the thorny issue of the\r\ncontinent’s external indebtedness. The attainment of\r\nsustainable development hinges on effective elimination\r\nof the bottleneck of external indebtedness. Many States in\r\nAfrica lack the financial capital needed to address basic\r\nexpectations and fundamental needs. In 1995 alone,\r\nAfrica’s external debt totalled $328.9 billion. To service\r\nthis debt, African countries would have to devote their\r\nexport earnings to donors as well as external commercial\r\nlenders.\r\nWhile Africa cannot avoid its share of responsibility\r\nfor the present debt predicament, the international\r\ncommunity needs to acknowledge its own role in the\r\ncreation of the problem. During the cold war, bilateral\r\nand multilateral loans were often linked mainly to\r\ngeopolitical priorities, purchasing political peace and\r\nstability in areas of interest to the super-Powers or their\r\nallies. In this connection, the Kingdom of Swaziland fully\r\nsupports the efforts of the Organization of African Unity\r\nin calling for an international agreement to clear the entire\r\ndebt stock for the poorest countries in Africa within a\r\nreasonably short period of time and in the context of\r\nAfrica’s overall economic reforms.\r\nIn the recently concluded Security Council\r\nministerial meeting convened by Ms. Hjelm-Wallén,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, the international\r\ncommunity spelt out in no uncertain terms its renewed\r\ncommitment to the plight of Africa. My delegation was\r\nencouraged to learn that our partners in the developed\r\nworld are determined to assist in reducing poverty in\r\nAfrica in order to build peace and prevent conflict as well\r\nas to promote African development in general. This is the\r\nkind of cooperation that we are looking for. Africa cannot\r\nbe left behind if the world is to be the global village that\r\nwe all aspire to.\r\nFinally, my delegation applauds the action taken by\r\nthe Security Council in ensuring that the continent\r\nassumes its rightful position in the international arena, and\r\nthe steps taken by the Council in its realization that\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 35th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 9 October 1998\r\naddressing conflict situations and threats to peace and\r\nsecurity without going deep into the root cause of conflicts\r\nis an exercise in futility and a waste of the resources\r\namassed by the Organization. My delegation therefore\r\nagrees with the Secretary-General’s report that Africa —\r\nand indeed, Africans themselves — should rise to the\r\nchallenge, but they must not be left alone to do so. In order\r\nto achieve durable peace and prosperity in Africa, we are\r\nof the view that there exists a moral imperative, a political,\r\nhumanitarian and economic necessity on the part of the\r\ninternational community, to respond to the plight of its\r\npartners in Africa. The measures that the General Assembly\r\nwill be adopting during this session must not steer us into\r\na situation of paralysis; the recommendations identified in\r\nthe report must be critically analysed with a view to their\r\nfull implementation.\r\nMr. Mahugu (Kenya): At the outset, my delegation\r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his pragmatic,\r\nobjective and, indeed, bold report on the causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. The report sets out a multifaceted\r\nand practical set of recommendations for action by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn his own words, the Secretary-General wishes the\r\nreport to form the beginning of a new relationship between\r\nthe United Nations and Africa. He has, in this spirit,\r\nchallenged us all, both individually and collectively, as\r\norganizations or States, to take the cue and seek to create\r\na new beginning that is result-oriented, productive,\r\nmeaningful and designed to resolve the current unhealthy\r\nsituation. It is therefore fitting that this item is included on\r\nthe agenda of the fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nKenya welcomes the challenge by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the three broad areas he has highlighted in his\r\nreport: the need for Africa to rely on political rather than\r\nmilitary responses to problems; the need to summon the\r\npolitical will to seriously promote good governance, human\r\nrights and democracy; and the necessity of undertaking and\r\nadhering to the various reforms necessary to promote\r\nsustainable economic growth and stability.\r\nSince the early nineties, African leaders have sought\r\nto resolve their conflicts by peaceful means. At the\r\ninstitutional level, the Organization of African Unity\r\nestablished in 1993 the Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution. That body has\r\nenhanced the many regional initiatives under way in\r\nseeking to resolve conflicts by peaceful means.\r\nIn addition, African States have embarked on\r\nimportant steps in instituting far-reaching political\r\nreforms. But a lot more remains to be done in order to\r\nsuccessfully complete the promotion and enhancement of\r\nthe process of democratization. This is an important area\r\nin which African States must rise to the challenge in\r\norder to establish good governance.\r\nAt present, Africa is characterized by political\r\nconflicts on the one hand and serious economic problems\r\non the other. These two characteristics are invariably\r\ninterrelated. We take this opportunity to express\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for highlighting this\r\nfundamental truth in his report. In our view, there can be\r\nno development without peace, and, conversely, there can\r\nbe no peace without development.\r\nIt is clearly evident that to succeed in building a\r\nframework for enduring peace and stability in Africa, the\r\ninternational community must work together with African\r\npeople. Africa needs support in all fields of its\r\nendeavours. In this context, I wish to mention the\r\nproblem of inadequate assistance for development, which\r\nis an indispensable complement to the policies of African\r\nStates and needs to be made sufficient. Africa’s total debt,\r\ncurrently at $350 billion, is also a problem that requires\r\nserious international consideration. I also wish to mention\r\nthe need for increased market access for African exports\r\nand the removal of trade barriers.\r\nWe therefore call upon the international community\r\nto do its share in addressing the causes of conflict in\r\nAfrica. The United Nations has an important role to play\r\nin this regard.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
