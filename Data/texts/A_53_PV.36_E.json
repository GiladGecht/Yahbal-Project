(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Filippi Balestra\r\n(San Marino), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work\r\nLetter from the Chairman of the Committee on\r\nConferences (A/53/298/Add.1)\r\nThe Acting President: I should like first to draw the\r\nattention of representatives to document A/53/298/Add.l,\r\nwhich contains a letter dated 1 October 1998 addressed to\r\nthe President of the General Assembly by the Chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Conferences. As members are aware, the\r\nAssembly, in paragraph 7 of its resolution 40/243, decided\r\nthat no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly should be\r\npermitted to meet at United Nations Headquarters during a\r\nregular session of the Assembly unless explicitly authorized\r\nby the Assembly.\r\nAs indicated in the letter I have just mentioned, the\r\nCommittee on Conferences has recommended that the\r\nGeneral Assembly authorize the Committee on Information\r\nto meet in New York during the main part of the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts the\r\nrecommendation of the Committee on Conferences?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 164 (continued)\r\nCauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/52/871)\r\nMr. Mohammed (Ethiopia): Permit me at the outset\r\nto thank the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his report on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development\r\nin Africa. The report provides a comprehensive and\r\nobjective analysis of the sources of conflict in Africa,\r\nranging from historical legacies to economic challenges\r\nand factors attributable to specific conflict situations.\r\nMost important, it examines, at length and with the\r\nrequisite clarity, the various ways and means at the\r\ndisposal of the international community and Africa to\r\naddress conflicts in the continent, and it draws important\r\nconclusions and recommendations that require further\r\nfollow-up and implementation. In this respect, my\r\ndelegation commends the follow-up actions taken thus far\r\nby the Secretary-General and by the Security Council, in\r\nparticular the holding of the ministerial meeting of the\r\nCouncil on 24 September 1998.\r\nWe are also grateful to the President of the General\r\nAssembly for giving this matter the attention and the\r\npriority it deserves in the deliberations of the Assembly\r\nat its current session.\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nAfrica is indeed a vast and varied continent, and the\r\nsources of conflict and the challenges it faces reflect in\r\nmany ways its diversity. But, as the Secretary-General\r\nrightly points out in his report, the sources of the challenges\r\nand conflicts in Africa are closely interrelated or are linked\r\nby a number of common themes and experiences. Inasmuch\r\nas the causes of conflict in Africa and the challenges that\r\nAfrican countries face are complex and diverse, their\r\nsolution clearly demands the determined effort of Africa\r\nand genuine partnership on the part of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe past few years have been viewed by many as the\r\nbeginning of a new era of hope and of African renaissance.\r\nNotwithstanding the failures and tragedies, especially in\r\nSomalia and Rwanda, the present decade has undoubtedly\r\nwitnessed important transformations in Africa. Many\r\nAfrican countries, including my own, have undertaken far-\r\nreaching political and economic reform measures aimed at\r\npromoting political pluralism and establishing an\r\nenvironment conducive to a market-oriented economy.\r\nRegional cooperation and integration have also gained new\r\ndimensions and momentum in Africa, leading to the\r\nestablishment of the African Economic Community and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. The role\r\nand contribution of subregional organizations, such as the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),\r\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\r\nand the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC), both in the field of economic integration and in\r\nconflict prevention and resolution have also become an\r\nimportant factor for stability and progress in Africa in\r\nrecent years.\r\nIn spite of these laudable accomplishments and our\r\nexpectations and hopes for the best, developments of the\r\npast few months, namely the emergence of new conflicts\r\nand the resurgence of old ones in various parts of Africa,\r\nhave become a serious source of concern and\r\npreoccupation. This makes the debate on the report of the\r\nSecretary-General and the focus on Africa all the more\r\ntimely and challenging.\r\nIn addressing the sources of conflict in Africa, the\r\nSecretary-General rightly refers to historical legacies as one\r\nof the factors of conflict in Africa, especially in the context\r\nof boundary or territorial disputes. The significance of these\r\nlegacies and the need for permanent solutions was\r\nacknowledged from the very outset by the founding fathers\r\nof our regional organization, the OAU, who in their great\r\nwisdom and vision declared in 1963 that African countries\r\nwould accept boundaries inherited at the time of their\r\naccession to independence. As rightly pointed out by the\r\nSecretary-General, that wisdom and vision of African\r\nleaders has proved over the past three and half decades to\r\nbe indispensable in preventing and resolving conflicts\r\narising from territorial claims in Africa.\r\nMore often than not, in situations of border disputes,\r\nviolations of this sacrosanct principle, accompanied by the\r\nuse of force, remain the primary source of territorial\r\nconflicts in Africa. Needless to say, even in the absence\r\nof that principle, it is very clear that international law\r\nprohibits the use of force, except in self-defence, as a\r\nmeans of resolving disputes or changing circumstances on\r\nthe ground.\r\nThis explains the cause of the present unfortunate\r\nand dangerous situation in the Horn of Africa, and the\r\nirresponsible and belligerent behaviour of Eritrea towards\r\nits neighbours and its recent aggression against Ethiopia.\r\nThe present conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is not\r\njust a simple or ordinary bilateral dispute between the two\r\ncountries. Rather it is the result of aggression committed\r\nby Eritrea, which constitutes a flagrant violation of\r\ninternational law and the principles enshrined in the\r\ncharters of the United Nations and of the OAU.\r\nThe Government of Ethiopia, guided by its\r\nunwavering commitment to the peace and development\r\nnot only of its own people but also of its subregion, has\r\nexercised maximum self-restraint in the face of the\r\nEritrean aggression. It has accepted and fully cooperated\r\nwith the various peace efforts, initiatives and decisions, in\r\nparticular those of the United States and Rwandan\r\nfacilitators and the decisions of the OAU and of the\r\nSecurity Council. Eritrea, however, remains defiant in its\r\nrejection of these important initiatives and decisions.\r\nIt goes without saying that primary responsibility for\r\nresolving conflicts in Africa and elsewhere rests in the\r\nhands of the parties directly involved. The international\r\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations system, and\r\nrelevant regional and subregional organizations also have\r\na pivotal role not only in facilitating or complementing\r\nthe efforts of the parties concerned, but also in ensuring\r\nrespect for the norms and principles of international law,\r\nespecially when these are so flagrantly violated. Inaction\r\non the part of the international community and\r\nappeasement in the face of such violations will only\r\nencourage intransigence and set a dangerous precedent\r\nwith far-reaching consequences for peace and stability. It\r\nshould be made clear that lasting peace cannot be\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nachieved at the expense of, or by compromising, principles\r\nand norms of international law, or by appeasement of those\r\nwho engage in irresponsible action.\r\nThe Secretary-General highlights in his report various\r\nmeans and methods of responding to conflict situations, and\r\nmakes important recommendations, some of which have\r\nbeen followed through by the Secretary-General and by the\r\nSecurity Council. In particular, we welcome the measures\r\naimed at enhancing African capacity and preparedness for\r\npeacekeeping, as well as the efforts being made to address\r\nquestions relating to illicit arms transfers and to the\r\nimplementation of arms embargoes imposed by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nOne of the important issues raised in the report is the\r\nrole of external factors in peace efforts and the need for\r\ncoordination of their actions. In fulfilling the mandate\r\nentrusted to it by the OAU and IGAD, Ethiopia has made\r\nand continues to make efforts to assist in the resolution of\r\nthe crisis in Somalia.\r\nOur experience in this regard has clearly shown that\r\nparallel initiatives and the lack of coordination among\r\nexternal actors have created obstacles to making an\r\neffective impact on the peace process. Therefore, with\r\nrecognition of the need for coordination of all external\r\nforces for durable peace in Somalia, encouraging efforts are\r\nnow being made to establish a mechanism for harmonizing\r\nthe policies and actions of external actors. We are confident\r\nthat the international community, and the United Nations in\r\nparticular, will provide their support for this endeavour, and\r\nwe remain actively engaged in the search for peace in\r\nSomalia.\r\nCooperation and coordination of activities between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OAU are essential for the success\r\nof efforts to deal with conflict situations in Africa. My\r\ndelegation wishes in this connection to acknowledge the\r\nimportant measures taken by the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations to enhance and strengthen the cooperation\r\nand coordination between the two organizations.\r\nThe tragic victims of violent conflicts in Africa, as in\r\nother parts of the world, are often innocent civilians,\r\nincluding children, which makes the humanitarian\r\ndimension of conflicts an issue of grave concern to the\r\ninternational community. In most conflict situations in the\r\ncontinent international action has been largely initiated in\r\nresponse to appalling humanitarian tragedies. In all\r\ncircumstances, however, it should be stressed clearly that\r\nrespect for the rules and norms of international\r\nhumanitarian law by all parties to a conflict is not an\r\noption, but an imperative. Humanitarian responses and\r\nactions need to be undertaken in a coordinated and timely\r\nmanner and with strict adherence to the humanitarian\r\nprinciples of neutrality, impartiality and universality. It is\r\nof absolute importance that all the sectors involved in\r\nhumanitarian activities, including the United Nations\r\nsystem, respect these principles and avoid roles contrary\r\nto their mandates, which must remain strictly\r\nhumanitarian at all times and in all places.\r\nAs pointed out in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\ndevelopment is a human right and remains the principal\r\nlong-term objective of all countries in Africa. Sustainable\r\ndevelopment is also central to the prospect of conflict\r\nprevention and durable peace in Africa. It is clearly\r\nevident that to succeed in building frameworks for\r\nenduring peace and stability on the African continent, the\r\ninternational community must form genuine partnerships\r\nwith the African countries to strengthen the continent’s\r\nsocial and economic foundations.\r\nIn short, while the international community should\r\ncontinue to focus on achieving peace, security and\r\nstability, which are so pivotal, it should not ignore the\r\nmagnitude of the socio-economic challenges confronting\r\nthe continent, which are real and are at the centre of the\r\nissue of peace in the continent.\r\nAfrican countries are cognizant of this stark reality\r\nand have undertaken far-reaching economic reforms\r\naimed at revitalizing and transforming their economies. It\r\nwas hoped that these actions would make Africa an\r\nattractive destination for capital and foreign direct\r\ninvestment. Regrettably, these much desired outcomes\r\nhave largely not materialized. First, the level of external\r\nassistance is declining and export earnings are shrinking\r\nas commodity prices plummet. Secondly, due to declining\r\ndomestic resources to finance the necessary social\r\noverhead capital, Africa is not able to tap the benefits of\r\nthe growing global economy.\r\nAfrica therefore strongly advocates reforms and calls\r\nfor globalization that is responsive and sensitive to the\r\nsituation of the world’s weakest economies. This has to\r\nbe accomplished through increased and carefully targeted\r\nofficial development assistance flows, by opening up\r\nmarkets for commodities of export interest to Africa, by\r\nconverting official bilateral debts owed by the poorest\r\nAfrican countries into grants and by improving the access\r\nof people living in poverty to productive opportunity. In\r\nthis regard, Ethiopia fully endorses the recommendations\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nof the Secretary-General made at the informal meeting of\r\nthe Foreign Ministers of the Development Assistance\r\nCommittee countries and reiterated during the ministerial\r\nmeeting of the Security Council on 24 September 1998.\r\nThese recommendations rightly highlight priority areas in\r\nmeeting Africa’s economic challenges. We believe that\r\nimplementation of these recommendations greatly helps\r\nmitigate the negative impacts of globalization in Africa. It\r\ncould also help the efforts of African countries to promote\r\neconomic growth and development in the continent.\r\nIn concluding, let me express the conviction of my\r\ndelegation that with sufficient political will and\r\ndetermination on the part of all of us — both in Africa and\r\nin the international community at large — we will be able\r\nto lay a solid foundation for peace and development in\r\nAfrica as we enter the new millennium.\r\nMr. Pohan (Indonesia): The delegation of Indonesia\r\nconsiders it both timely and appropriate for the General\r\nAssembly to undertake a review and reappraisal of our\r\ncollective and concerted endeavours to restore peace and\r\nstability and enhance prospects for development in the\r\nAfrican continent. Our deliberations reflect the continuing\r\nconcern of the international community over these issues\r\nfacing Africa and its collective determination to forge a\r\npartnership between the continent and the rest of the world\r\nto resolve them.\r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for his report\r\nof 13 April 1998 on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica, which contains balanced suggestions between\r\neconomic and security issues, on the one hand, and internal\r\nand international aspects, on the other, and whose\r\nimplementation would bolster peace and security in the\r\ncontinent. We also support the five priority areas he\r\noutlined at the outset of our debate. In our view, the steps\r\nto be taken by the Secretariat and United Nations organs on\r\nfollow-up activities based on these specific proposals\r\ncontain realistic and achievable goals in mitigating the\r\nnumerous problems confronting the African countries.\r\nIndonesia reiterates its support for the efforts being\r\nmade to reach the goals envisioned by the people of Africa,\r\nin concert with the position taken by the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement in its Final Document adopted in Durban, South\r\nAfrica. The Movement, while recognizing the recent\r\npositive developments in Africa in the socio-economic\r\nfields, injected a fresh, new momentum into our continuing\r\nendeavours to collectively address the various interlinked\r\nissues through a comprehensive and integrated approach.\r\nOn the basis of the experience of many Member\r\nStates, including Indonesia, a recognition of the\r\ninterrelated nature of peace, security and development\r\nagainst the backdrop of a world that is entering a\r\nqualitatively new horizon should lead to the peaceful\r\nresolution of disputes which will mitigate the negative\r\nimpact of globalization that threatens to marginalize the\r\ndeveloping countries and further reduce the minimal\r\nadvantages they enjoy.\r\nAs Africa stands poised at the threshold of the next\r\nmillennium and looks towards the attainment of its goals\r\nof stable peace and secure economic prosperity, its\r\nabundant natural resources and the innate genius of its\r\npeople will be a force to be reckoned with in the global\r\neconomy. However, such a prospect calls for an\r\nenvironment of peace and security, without which\r\ndevelopment would be impeded. Hence, my delegation\r\nviews with apprehension the persistence of conflicts in\r\nvarious parts of Africa, resulting in an unconscionable toll\r\nin human lives and material devastation. In this regard,\r\nwe welcome the involvement of the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and subregional\r\norganizations, and we commend their tireless efforts to\r\nresolve disputes peacefully and amicably through dialogue\r\nand negotiations, as conflicts in Africa are not amenable\r\nto military solutions. There is much that these\r\norganizations can achieve through working in concert to\r\nremove obstacles that endanger security, and thereby\r\nfacilitate the peace process. Ultimately, however, it is up\r\nto the leaders of Africa to set aside their differences in\r\nthe larger interests of their peoples and countries. The\r\nneed of the hour demands no less.\r\nIt is pertinent to note that in its presidential\r\nstatement of 16 September 1998, the Security Council\r\naffirmed its intention to take steps consistent with its\r\nresponsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand called for the strengthening of Africa’s capacity to\r\nparticipate in all aspects of peacekeeping and for\r\nincreased bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the field\r\nof peacekeeping. Resolution 1197 (1998), adopted by the\r\nCouncil last month, focuses our attention on the need to\r\nundertake a series of measures that would contribute to\r\nconflict prevention and resolution. Taken together, they\r\nwould augment Africa’s capabilities with regard to both\r\npeacekeeping and dealing with conflict situations and\r\nthereby contribute to the stability of the continent.\r\nIt is also self-evident that in the arduous task of\r\nbuilding the essential infrastructure for peace and stability\r\nin the African continent, the international community\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nmust work together with the African countries in\r\nstrengthening the continent’s economic and social\r\nfoundations. Poverty and pestilence, illiteracy and hunger\r\nbreed despair and resentment. Only through sustained\r\neconomic and social development will people gain a vested\r\ninterest in working towards peaceful solutions of their\r\ndifferences.\r\nIt no longer suffices for the international community\r\nto convene and merely engage in perfunctory expressions\r\nof empathy and support for the African countries without\r\nextending concrete assistance. If indeed there is a genuine\r\ndesire to prevent humanitarian disaster or to avoid costly\r\npeacekeeping operations and peacemaking efforts, then\r\ncomprehensive, concerted and concrete action on economic\r\ndevelopment cooperation must be taken. Anything less will\r\ncast aspersions on the credibility of the international\r\ncommunity’s commitment to the cause of Africa. Let me\r\nemphasize our full support for the Assembly’s endeavours\r\nin exercising its jurisdiction and in fulfilling its\r\nresponsibilities to Africa.\r\nIndonesia’s commitment to the people of Africa has in\r\nthe past been demonstrated by, among other things, its\r\nsupport of African development during its chairmanship of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, its participation in such\r\nforums as the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s; support for the United\r\nNations Special Initiative on Africa; and bilateral\r\ncooperation with a number of African countries.\r\nFinally, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that\r\nIndonesia convened a High-level Advisory Meeting on the\r\nSouth Summit in Jakarta last August and will convene the\r\nforthcoming High-level Meeting on Regional/Subregional\r\nCooperation in Bali from 2 to 4 December of this year,\r\nwhich will pave the way for the next South summit meeting\r\nin Cuba prior to the Millennium Assembly in the year 2000\r\nto further intensify South-South cooperation. It is our hope\r\nthat these processes will help meet the challenges of\r\nglobalization facing the South, and Africa in particular, and\r\nthereby facilitate the integration of the developing countries\r\ninto the mainstream of the global economy.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (interpretation\r\nfrom French): As the Security Council has done, the\r\nGeneral Assembly is today considering the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThis discussion is important for two reasons. First,\r\nit concerns peace and development in Africa and therefore\r\nthe future of that continent. Given the major challenges\r\nposed at the end of this century by economic\r\nglobalization and technological changes, which themselves\r\ngive rise to serious concerns about the future of\r\nhumankind, the African peoples, more than others, are\r\nfeeling vulnerable. They are turning, full of hope, to our\r\nOrganization, which has worked so hard for their\r\nfreedom.\r\nThey are expecting these discussions to shed the\r\nnecessary light to enable us to discern the signs of the\r\ntimes, interpret the complex realities of human existence\r\nand provide more humane conditions of life. They are\r\nexpecting also recommendations conducive to concrete\r\nand sustained action.\r\nThese deliberations are likewise important because,\r\nsince they coincide with a twofold fiftieth anniversary —\r\nthat of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of\r\npeacekeeping operations — they bring us to the very\r\nraison d’être of the United Nations. Indeed, the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations created it, inter alia, to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war and to\r\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\r\nlarger freedom.\r\nThe United Nations thus has a mission to promote\r\npeace and development, but these efforts are not close to\r\nfruition in today’s Africa. But with the will and resolve\r\nof the African peoples, these goals will be achieved\r\ntomorrow with — we hope — the sustained support of\r\nthe international community. That is what is at stake in\r\nthese deliberations.\r\nAt this stage, allow me to reiterate our most heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General on the report,\r\nwhose clear-sighted analyses and bold conclusions we\r\nsupport. To its credit, the report calls upon us to consider\r\nthe issue of security from a holistic perspective. Security\r\nand therefore peace can be guaranteed in a durable way\r\nonly if we fight together to reduce poverty and to\r\npromote development and democracy.\r\nThe report, truly a plea for development and peace\r\nin Africa, makes a timely contribution to promoting the\r\nconfidence of the African masses in our Organization.\r\nThrough the deliberations it prompted in the Security\r\nCouncil, ordinary men and women throughout Africa\r\nwere able to hear, in the voice of their United Nations, an\r\necho of their own daily reality.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General is, in our opinion,\r\na plea for peace in Africa. This peace can be assured only\r\nby the peaceful settlement and prevention of conflicts. We\r\ncan no longer, we must no longer, prepare for war in order\r\nto have peace; rather, we need to support peace in order to\r\nprevent war. These two concepts constitute the essence of\r\nmy statement.\r\nAs this century comes to a close, Africa is the arena\r\nof many conflicts. Within some States, ethnic and political\r\ndifferences and conflicts of interest — because they have\r\nbeen improperly dealt with or poorly managed — are\r\ndegenerating into confrontation and civil war. Likewise,\r\nneighbouring, brotherly countries are divided or torn apart\r\nby border disputes born, in most instances, of lack of\r\nrespect for the sacrosanct principle of the inviolability of\r\nthe borders inherited from the colonial era.\r\nAs regards the consequences, considerable resources\r\nhave been mobilized to conduct fratricidal wars while\r\nhunger racks populations, and there is a distressing\r\nprocession of refugees, displaced persons and entire\r\npopulations that are prey to epidemics, massacres and\r\nslaughter.\r\nAfrica needs peace. Already facing so many scourges,\r\nit cannot continue to enjoy the luxury of useless and\r\nexpensive wars among its peoples. If it is to have peace,\r\ntolerance and respect must once again become African\r\nvirtues. Law, dialogue, working together and seeking\r\nconsensus in order to reconcile apparently opposing\r\ninterests preserve peace better than taking up arms.\r\nSuch dialogue must be the rule in relations among\r\nAfrican States, all of which, in accordance with the Charter\r\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and that of the\r\nUnited Nations, are committed to resolving their differences\r\nby peaceful means, including by having recourse to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nAfrica expects the international community to support\r\nthe strengthening of the capacities to intervene and act of\r\nthe conflict-settlement mechanisms that have been\r\nestablished by the Africans themselves. It also expects the\r\ninternational community to provide constructive, positive\r\nsupport to the democratization process taking place as part\r\nof the establishment of States based on the rule of law in\r\norder to ensure peace and stability.\r\nSuch assistance must be provided impartially, without\r\nsystematic support for certain political factions. It should\r\nhelp promote and consolidate national concord. In order to\r\nmaintain peace in Africa we also need to commit\r\nourselves resolutely to conflict prevention. This brings me\r\nto the second point of my speech.\r\nAccording to the Charter, the mission of the United\r\nNations is\r\n“to take effective collective measures for the\r\nprevention and removal of threats to the peace”.\r\nConflict prevention is thus one of the primary\r\nresponsibilities of the Organization. And yet we do not\r\nalways sufficiently stress preventive action. In fact, more\r\nof the resources of the Organization are used for purely\r\ntherapeutic measures such as the deployment of\r\npeacekeeping operations — which are often deployed too\r\nlate.\r\nTherefore, we think it useful to stress some activities\r\nthat could help prevent conflicts or, at the very least,\r\nprevent those conflicts from degenerating into violence or\r\narmed struggle. Peacekeeping forces made available to\r\nStates after or during a conflict, seek to prevent a\r\nresumption of violence. Cameroon believes that the\r\nUnited Nations, and in particular the Security Council,\r\ncould decide to systematically deploy forces preventively\r\nin situations where there was a clear danger of an armed\r\nconflict breaking out at any moment. This would be\r\nparticularly relevant to border disputes. Given the success\r\nof the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force in the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, it should not\r\nremain the lone example of this approach. Likewise, when\r\nconfronted with these conflict situations the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should be encouraged to have greater recourse to\r\nthe appointment of personal representatives.\r\nIn the context of the struggle for peace in Africa,\r\nspecial attention should be paid to the illicit trafficking in\r\nsmall arms and their circulation among civilians. This is\r\na matter of concern to us. Ninety per cent of those\r\nwounded or killed by these weapons are civilians — 80\r\nper cent of them women or children. It is therefore urgent\r\nto seek a global consensus on the oversight and control of\r\nillicit arms transfers. Cameroon welcomes the convening,\r\nin the near future we hope, of a United Nations\r\nconference to consider all aspects of the illicit arms trade.\r\nThe Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions\r\nin Central Africa would appreciate United Nations\r\nassistance so that we could develop effective measures for\r\nstemming the flow of small arms in our subregion.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nThe prevention of conflicts necessarily depends on the\r\ndevelopment of a culture of peace. We appreciate the aid\r\nreceived from the United Nations, through the Standing\r\nAdvisory Committee, to support our efforts to consolidate\r\npeace and security in the subregion.\r\nWe are confident that we can continue to benefit from\r\nthis assistance and that of friendly countries for the\r\npursuance of our programmes to develop the men and\r\nwomen of our subregion into makers of peace. This is an\r\nurgent and importance task. The preamble to the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\nConstitution reminds us that\r\n“since wars begin in the minds of men, and it is in the\r\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be\r\nconstructed”.\r\nThe effort to prevent conflicts cannot be confined to\r\npolitical causes; it must also deal with economic causes.\r\nAs the Security Council, meeting at the level of heads\r\nof State or Government on 31 January 1992, acknowledged,\r\n“The absence of war and military conflicts\r\namongst States does not in itself ensure international\r\npeace and security. The non-military sources of\r\ninstability in the economic...[field] have become\r\nthreats to peace and security.” (S/23500, presidential\r\nstatement, eleventh paragraph)\r\nPoverty is therefore a threat to peace and stability.\r\nThis is all the more true in Africa, where, because of the\r\ncrushing debt burden, the constraints of structural\r\nadjustment and the dwindling aid received, African States\r\nare no longer able to finance adequately the minimum\r\nsocial services that are necessary for the well-being of their\r\npeoples.\r\nHence, how can we prevent conflicts in Africa if we\r\ndo not attack the economic and social problems that have\r\nan impact on peace and security with the same energy as\r\nwe tackle political problems?\r\nThe holistic view of security, which was so eloquently\r\ndescribed by the Secretary-General in his report, calls for\r\nthe Security Council, to which the Charter confers “primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity”, to use all of the Charter’s potential to attack\r\npoverty in Africa. Why not use the machinery described in\r\nits Article 65, whereby the Economic and Social Council\r\ncan provide the Security Council with information and\r\nassist it if the latter so requests?\r\nWhat Africa needs to ensure its sustainable\r\ndevelopment is, in the first place, an equitable solution to\r\nthe debt burden problem, which is strangling the\r\neconomies of our countries to the point where financial\r\ntransfers have become negative for many of them. Here\r\nwe welcome the announcement by the Secretary-General\r\nof the holding this week of a high-level round table on\r\nAfrican debt. It also needs a balanced partnership with the\r\nindustrialized countries that would allow Africa to get the\r\naid and investments it needs. Finally, it needs a review of\r\nthe working methods and functioning of the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank so that these two\r\nimportant instruments will serve Africa and its sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThat is why Cameroon welcomes the proposal of the\r\nSecretary-General to target efforts towards resolving the\r\neconomic problems of Africa in the five following\r\npriority areas: increasing and improving official\r\ndevelopment assistance; converting into grants all\r\nremaining official bilateral debt; expanding access to the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative;\r\nmaking more flexible the conditions for access to markets\r\nfor African exports; and finally, increasing investments.\r\nIf the international community were to keep its promises\r\nin these five areas, there would be real progress towards\r\nthe creation of conditions for sustainable development and\r\ndurable peace in Africa.\r\nCameroon made the following point last April in the\r\nSecurity Council: the absence of development may\r\nconstitute a threat to international prosperity, peace and\r\nsecurity. As communications develop, distances between\r\nvarious parts of the planet are getting much smaller.\r\nThe twenty-first century cannot tolerate islands of\r\nprosperity and opulence in an ocean of suffering and\r\ndestitution. Africa’s economic backwardness, therefore, is\r\nstill a major challenge to us all; we can and must meet\r\nthis challenge. Global equilibrium and the very survival\r\nof humankind depend on it.\r\nThe international community has mobilized in the\r\npast to rebuild and develop some parts of the world.\r\nAfrica expects the international community to assist it in\r\nits renaissance at the dawn of the third millennium. When\r\nAfrica awakes, it will remember.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nMr. Mapuranga (Zimbabwe): My delegation fully\r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by the\r\nrepresentative of Namibia on behalf of the Southern African\r\nStates, as well as that delivered by the representative of\r\nBurkina Faso on behalf of the member States of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). I shall therefore\r\nendeavour to refrain from making a contribution repetitive\r\nof issues already raised in those two statements.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to recall that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report entitled “The causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica” was the subject of a formal meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil. We are encouraged to note that the Security\r\nCouncil, for its part, has taken significant steps, such as\r\nsetting up working groups and adopting important\r\nresolutions on the Secretary-General’s recommendations.\r\nIn this regard, we most heartily welcome this meeting,\r\nwhich has afforded the Assembly the opportunity to focus\r\non aspects of the report which lie within the purview of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s authority.\r\nAs we explore ways and means of achieving peace,\r\nsecurity and stability, we cannot ignore the magnitude of\r\nthe socio-economic problems confronting the African\r\ncontinent, which are ever so real and lie at the very core of\r\nthe issue of peace and stability in Africa, the most\r\neconomically backward region of the world. Very often,\r\nthere is a tendency to dwell on the symptoms, while\r\navoiding a confrontation with the root causes of instability\r\nin Africa.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General emphasizes that\r\nany and all efforts at securing peace have to be combined\r\nwith steps towards ending Africa’s poverty. Specifically, he\r\ncalled for the promotion of investment for economic\r\ngrowth, ensuring adequate levels of international aid,\r\nreducing the excruciating debt burden and opening\r\ninternational markets to Africa’s products. This is an appeal\r\nwhich has the full support of my delegation, because it\r\naddresses some of the root causes of conflict in my\r\ncontinent.\r\nMy delegation strongly supports the priorities\r\nhighlighted by the Secretary-General on 24 September 1998\r\nat the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers of the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\n(OECD) Development Assistant Committee. Those priority\r\nneeds are to increase the volume and improve the quality of\r\nofficial development assistance; to consider converting all\r\nremaining official bilateral debt owed by poor countries into\r\ngrants; to liberalize access to the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative; to ease access conditions for\r\nAfrican exports; and to encourage investment in Africa,\r\nwhich has largely been marginalized in the process of\r\nglobalization. I wish at this point to acknowledge and\r\ncongratulate those Governments and development partners\r\nwhich have taken the lead in responding to these priority\r\nneeds by converting bilateral debt owed by the poorest\r\nAfrican countries into grants and increasing their\r\ndevelopment budgets in general.\r\nMost of our countries in Africa have come a long\r\nway and made significant and very demanding strides to\r\ncreate an enabling environment for investment and\r\neconomic growth. I wish to assure the international\r\ncommunity that Africa will not be found wanting in this\r\nglobal effort to promote durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment on the continent. We have long realized that\r\nAfrica’s problems require African leadership to find the\r\nsolutions, but there is much that countries with greater\r\nresources can do in solidarity to make those solutions\r\nwork.\r\nIn this connection, the United Nations should\r\nendeavour to extend, in concrete terms, assistance to the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution.\r\nSimilarly, it is imperative to support such subregional\r\nsecurity arrangements as the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG), which accomplished a splendid mission by\r\nrestoring a democratically elected Government in Sierra\r\nLeone, and the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence and\r\nSecurity, whose member States are currently involved in\r\noperations to uphold the authority of the Government in\r\nthe Kingdom of Lesotho and to defend the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo from invasion by two of its\r\nneighbours.\r\nWith regard to the role of the United Nations\r\nsystem, my delegation welcomes the commitment made\r\nby the Secretary-General that the Senior Management\r\nGroup and the important sectors represented by those\r\nsenior managers should vigorously work on follow-up\r\nactivities to the report. We are most pleased that the\r\nSecretary-General has asked the Deputy Secretary-General\r\nto monitor the implementation of those follow-up\r\nactivities. We also wish to encourage the pace-setting\r\ncontacts and exchanges between the Secretaries-General\r\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\r\nUnity.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nI wish to conclude by reiterating the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s findings that peace and prosperity must be sought\r\nas one, with equal zeal and priority, and that political\r\nstability needs to be buttressed by economic development.\r\nLet us realize the goal of promoting durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa.\r\nMr. Dangue Réwaka (Gabon) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It is well known that the Security Council, of\r\nwhich Gabon is currently a member, has held two formal\r\nmeetings on the Secretary-General’s report on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa to consider the recommendations that\r\nfall within its purview as the principal organ responsible for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nFollowing the first of these two meetings, held on 24\r\nApril 1998, the Security Council adopted resolution 1170\r\n(1998), whereby it decided, inter alia, to establish an ad\r\nhoc Working Group mandated\r\n“to review all recommendations in the report related\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nand in that context, to prepare a framework for the\r\nimplementation of recommendations, as appropriate,\r\nand to submit specific proposals for concrete action\r\nfor consideration by the Council by September 1998”.\r\n(Security Council resolution 1170 (1998), para. 4)\r\nThat Working Group, chaired by Gabon, has brought\r\nits thinking process to bear on the topics of coordination\r\nbetween the Organization and African regional and\r\nsubregional organizations in the areas of prevention and\r\npeacekeeping; the building of African capacity in\r\npeacekeeping; illicit flows of small arms; strengthening\r\narms embargoes; security and neutrality in refugee camps;\r\nand the Security Council’s ability to monitor the activities\r\nit has authorized. It was in this context of broader activity\r\nthat the Security Council, at its meeting of 24 September\r\n1998, began to take specific measures to follow-up the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations. As Gabon clearly\r\nexpressed its views on these matters during the Council\r\nmeetings devoted to the report, I am sure I may today focus\r\nsolely on the problems involved in promoting durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa.\r\nAmong the aspects underlined by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report, I would particularly stress that the\r\nbasic principles of democracy must be respected in Africa\r\nbecause, in our opinion, the continent’s development\r\ndemands that all actors of civil society be taken into\r\naccount. Thus it is vital that the people themselves take\r\ncharge of their development. In order to do this, they\r\nmust ensure that their rights are recognized and that\r\ndemocratic rules are observed in the conduct of their\r\ncountry’s social, economic and political affairs.\r\nAs far as my country is concerned, the head of the\r\nGabonese delegation has already at this fifty-third session\r\neloquently reported on the work we have done and are\r\ncontinuing to do in all those areas.\r\nWith respect to sustainable development, we concur\r\nwith the Secretary-General about the need for economic\r\ngrowth to be accompanied by progress on the social and\r\nhuman levels. High priority must therefore be given to the\r\ndevelopment of social services in order to meet basic\r\nneeds and support human capital, particularly in the key\r\nareas of education, health and vulnerable groups.\r\nPlainly, if this target is to be met, there must be\r\ninvestment in infrastructures, as well as economic and\r\npolitical reforms in order to create an environment\r\nfavourable to the emergence of a productive private sector\r\nand an efficient public sector. Recent studies by the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) on direct foreign investment around the world\r\nprove that Africa is a profitable region for investors. But\r\nwe must note that for some years development assistance\r\nhas steadily declined, with attendant adverse effects on\r\nthe economies of many African countries.\r\nInternational assistance therefore needs to be\r\nrestructured, and the developed countries should be urged\r\nto direct that assistance towards the sectors deemed\r\nworthy of priority by the African countries and to\r\nincrease it substantially in order to offset the shortage of\r\ndirect foreign investment and of national resources.\r\nLikewise, donor countries should fulfil the commitments\r\nthey have freely made and strive to bring their aid and\r\nassistance programmes into line with the recipient\r\ncountries’ plans.\r\nIt cannot be overemphasized that an increase in\r\nfinancial resources for Africa’s development necessarily\r\ninvolves a lasting solution to the painful problem of\r\nAfrican debt. Certainly, relief has been agreed to by many\r\ndonor countries, but increased efforts need to be made.\r\nIn this respect, while hailing the initiative of the\r\nBretton Woods institutions in favour of the most indebted\r\nand poorest countries, it is regrettable that the number of\r\nbeneficiary countries of that initiative is still restricted\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nbecause of the slow pace of the debt-relief process and the\r\nconditionalities imposed. Accordingly, I support the\r\nSecretary-General’s idea that concerted political action at\r\nthe highest level is required in order to find a satisfactory\r\nresolution of the problem of African debt.\r\nHas not the time come to apply the twofold proposal\r\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which\r\nadvocates forgiveness of all the debt of the poorest African\r\ncountries and reconsideration of the situation of so-called\r\nupper tier, middle-income countries within a reasonably\r\nshort period of time and in the context of comprehensive\r\nreform of their respective economies?\r\nThose are some factors which combine to exacerbate\r\ntension and conflict in our continent.\r\nConcerted action by Member States of the United\r\nNations, the United Nations system as a whole and the\r\ninternational financial institutions, together with other\r\norganizations, would help to give a comprehensive,\r\nsatisfactory response to the multisectoral recommendations\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that our efforts would be\r\nfruitless if at the end of this exercise the General Assembly\r\nfailed to adopt, for example, a plan of action and follow-up\r\nmechanism which would facilitate and secure\r\nimplementat ion of the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations.\r\nMr. Benítez-Sáenz (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The question before us is one of the priorities of\r\nUruguay’s foreign policy: the situation in Africa, the\r\nmaintenance of lasting peace as a top priority for\r\nsustainable development and full enjoyment of the inherent\r\nfreedoms and rights of the individual, with the full exercise\r\nof democratic government. Without peace there cannot be\r\nfull respect for human rights. Without peace it is not\r\npossible to secure sustainable development. Without peace\r\nit is not possible to have the full exercise of a democratic\r\nsystem of government in which the three branches of the\r\nState — the executive, legislative and judicial — enjoy\r\ntheir rights on an equal footing and independent of one\r\nanother.\r\nI can be very brief, because we fully agree with all of\r\nthe excellent report presented by the Secretary-General in\r\ndocument A/52/871 of 13 April 1998. We are glad that the\r\nreport, originally requested by the Security Council, has\r\nalso been submitted by the Secretary-General to the\r\nAssembly because this contributes not only to recognition\r\nof the legitimate powers of this sovereign organ of the\r\nOrganization, but also to highlighting them.\r\nBecause of its own history, nature and particular\r\ncharacteristics, Uruguay regards its presence in Africa as\r\na matter of fraternal equality, with all the solidarity that\r\nsuch feelings involve. Uruguay’s sole interest is in\r\ncooperation with the fraternal continent in order to secure\r\nthe stability necessary for its development and well-being.\r\nWe are convinced that the development and well-being of\r\nAfrica mean the development and well-being of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, and that they will contribute\r\nto the development and well-being of the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\nTo that end, Uruguay has deployed its personnel in\r\na number of peacekeeping operations. It has contributed\r\nin this way in Mozambique, Liberia and Rwanda, and its\r\npersonnel are still being deployed in Angola and Western\r\nSahara.\r\nThese operations have meant the loss of Uruguayan\r\nlives; our nation’s citizens have shed their blood on\r\nAfrican soil. Though this has meant inconsolable grief for\r\nour families, it has also certainly, contributed to exalting\r\nthe honour of our people, civilian or military, as they\r\ncontribute alongside the fraternal peoples of Africa to the\r\nobjective of peacekeeping.\r\nBut this is not all that binds us to the African\r\ncontinent. Just a few months ago, at a high-level meeting,\r\nwe were considering the importance of ensuring equal\r\naccess for all developing countries to international\r\nmarkets. On that same occasion, my delegation stated that\r\nsecuring competitiveness and a more active involvement\r\nin international markets is today a prerequisite for growth.\r\nWe need only glance at the African continent and at\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean to understand how\r\nimportant agriculture is in those countries for achieving\r\nsustained economic development. For this reason,\r\nUruguay once again reaffirms that we must work in\r\nconcert within the framework of the competent\r\nmultilateral institutions in order to significantly reduce\r\nagricultural tariffs, which now rise as high as 600 per\r\ncent.\r\nWe must join forces to end export subsidies on\r\nagricultural products from developed countries, which\r\nwork to the detriment of those of us who wish to achieve\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\ngreater economic growth, well-being, food security and\r\nsustainable development. We feel able to compete in a free\r\nand well-balanced world market, but we will never be able\r\nto compete with the treasuries of the industrialized\r\ncountries.\r\nFive days ago, in this very Assembly, we\r\ncommemorated the twentieth anniversary of the Buenos\r\nAires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing\r\nTechnical Cooperation among developing Countries. We are\r\nconvinced that this instrument of international cooperation\r\nremains an essential tool for our countries in today’s world.\r\nIn this context, Uruguay, together with a number of South\r\nAmerican and African countries, has set up the Afro-Latin\r\nAmerican Institute, whose purpose is to promote political\r\nbonds between these two subregions in order, in the future,\r\nto have closer relations and share mutual experiences in\r\nareas such as trade, education, health and agriculture.\r\nIt should also be noted that Uruguay, Argentina and\r\nBrazil, together with the African countries that have\r\ncoastlines on the South Atlantic, make up the Zone of\r\nPeace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic. This\r\nrepresents one more area of political and economic\r\ncooperation, as well as a guarantee of peace in the region.\r\nFor all these reasons, in conclusion, we feel bound to\r\nunderscore our full concurrence with the Secretary-General\r\nregarding the need to conduct preventive diplomacy in a\r\nbetter, more precise and more global fashion, having\r\nparticularly in mind post-conflict activities that will permit\r\nthe construction and consolidation of lasting and durable\r\npeace in Africa.\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): There was wisdom in\r\nbringing to the attention of the General Assembly the\r\nquestion of the causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa. We\r\nshare the position that, while the matter should continue to\r\nenjoy high priority on the agenda of the Security Council,\r\nconsideration by the General Assembly is required.\r\nAfrica is a huge and rich continent. As the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General correctly indicates, the sources of\r\nconflict in Africa are a reflection of the continent’s\r\ndiversity and complexity. Yet it is easy to perceive the\r\nelements that have preconditioned these conflicts. Some are,\r\nof course, internal in nature; others are legacies of the past,\r\nwhen kingdoms, States and communities were arbitrarily\r\ndivided by the colonial masters; and still others are\r\nconsequences of economic want, with the control of\r\nprecious natural resources or competition for scarce land\r\nand water resources igniting border problems.\r\nAs noted in the same report, more that 30 wars have\r\nbeen fought in Africa since 1970, the majority of them\r\nintra-State in origin.\r\nIt may be worth noting that the promised benefits of\r\nthe process of globalization appear to be elusive for many\r\ncountries in Africa. At the same time, other African\r\ncountries have in fact been adversely affected by the\r\nnegative forces of globalization through depressed prices\r\nin export commodities following the financial turmoil that\r\nbegan in East Asia. Invariably, this has accentuated the\r\ninherent conditions inhibiting sustainable development in\r\nmany African countries.\r\nWe must all realize that the continuing conflicts in\r\nAfrica pose a major challenge to all our efforts to ensure\r\nglobal peace, security and prosperity. All efforts vis-à-vis\r\nother flash points in the world are incomplete and\r\ninconclusive unless the conflicts in Africa are seriously\r\naddressed. The international community and the African\r\ncountries themselves must be able to find ways and\r\nmeans to quickly end the civil strife that is occurring in\r\nsome parts of the continent, prevent more conflicts and\r\nprovide a durable foundation for peace, security and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe believe that peacemaking efforts need to be well\r\ncoordinated and well prepared. In this regard, we fully\r\nagree with the Secretary-General’s statement that\r\n“Where a peace process is needed, it is the role of\r\nthe United Nations, with OAU, to help create one.”\r\n(A/52/871, para. 18)\r\nCertainly, the role of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and other regional bodies in Africa such as the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nand the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) in the resolution of the conflicts in Africa and its\r\ndevelopment and prosperity cannot be overemphasized.\r\nMy delegation is pleased that the Security Council\r\nhas taken up the recommendations in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General and that appropriate follow-up actions\r\nare being pursued. In this regard, we encourage the\r\nWorking Group established pursuant to Security Council\r\nresolution 1170 (1998) to carry out its important task in\r\nthe most expeditious manner.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nWe also believe that efforts aimed at preventing armed\r\nconflicts should continue to be directed towards those parts\r\nof Africa where the potential for conflict remains high. In\r\nthis regard, it becomes crucial that the international\r\ncommunity accord the fullest support to Security Council\r\nresolutions 1196 (1998) and 1197 (1998), aimed at\r\nstrengthening both the effectiveness of arms embargoes on\r\nconflict areas and the peacekeeping capacity of the African\r\ncountries themselves.\r\nStopping the proliferation of arms will also have a\r\ngreater chance of success if accompanied by an initiative\r\nengaging the countries concerned in a process of\r\nconfidence-building and thus giving them a common\r\naspiration for security and development. We therefore\r\nsupport any initiative that the United Nations can\r\nimplement in this regard. The United Nations should be\r\nable to evolve a strategy that brings into focus all\r\ninterrelated elements, encouraging concerned African\r\ncountries to put at centre stage the commonality of their\r\ninterests for a stable and prosperous Africa.\r\nThe usual tools of peacemaking must be brought to\r\nbear. This may involve the deployment of peacemaking\r\nresources as essential ingredients of the strategy. It may\r\nrefer to diplomatic efforts and the traditional approaches of\r\nnegotiation, mediation, good offices, fact-finding missions\r\nand judicial resolution.\r\nBut one important component must be the protection\r\nof civilians in situations of conflict. We endorse the\r\nproposal in the Secretary-General’s report on zones of\r\npeace for children, join the call for stopping the use of\r\nchildren as combatants and reiterate our appeal to all parties\r\nin conflicts to respect existing universal humanitarian\r\nprinciples.\r\nApart from the security issue, the required action must\r\nalso address humanitarian needs and assistance for the\r\nrecovery and reconstruction of affected African countries.\r\nProviding assistance to the victims of conflict is a moral\r\nimperative and must be pursued as a complement to action\r\ndirected at the resolution of the conflict itself. It is not a\r\nsubstitute for political action aimed at conflict resolution. It\r\nis a necessary provision, as a step towards full recovery,\r\nrehabilitation and development. It is therefore critical that\r\nhumanitarian assistance be properly coordinated with the\r\naffected countries themselves.\r\nAnother critical component of the strategy is the\r\nstrengthening of the economic foundations for sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the African countries. Many of them\r\ncontinue to rely substantially on official development\r\nassistance for development financing. It is important that\r\nthere should be no disruption or reduction in the provision\r\nof such sources of finance. We note the comment in\r\nparagraph 90 of the same report of the Secretary-General\r\nthat\r\n“Dramatic cuts in assistance to Africa have been\r\nregistered in recent years. This trend has hurt rather\r\nthan helped Africa’s efforts to implement the\r\ndifficult economic and political reforms which are\r\nnow under way across the continent.”\r\nOn a related issue, the United Nations system should\r\nbe able to sustain a level of development cooperation that\r\nis adequately funded and supported by the donor\r\ncommunity. We need to reinvigorate all the initiatives that\r\nfavour the countries in Africa, such as United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nThe international community must also find a\r\nsolution to Africa’s unsustainable external debt burden. In\r\nparagraph 95 of his report, the Secretary-General notes\r\nthat\r\n“Significant movement on lifting Africa’s\r\ncrippling debt burden will require concerted political\r\naction at the highest levels.”\r\nMy delegation fully endorses the call of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for definitive action by the international\r\ncommunity on the question of Africa’s external debt.\r\nMy delegation also joins the call for special efforts\r\nthat must be extended by the developed countries to\r\nensure access for competitive African goods and\r\ncommodities. We agree with the proposal that the\r\nquestion of eliminating trade barriers to African products\r\nshould be high on the agenda of the major industrialized\r\ncountries and that in this regard an appropriate common\r\npolicy should be adopted either bilaterally between the\r\nconcerned African countries and the developed countries\r\nor within the World Trade Organization.\r\nI wish to conclude by expressing the hope that the\r\nstatements we have all made before this Assembly may\r\nbe translated into specific contributions to resolve the\r\nperennial conflict in the African continent and bring about\r\npeace, security and prosperity in that region.\r\nLet me also reaffirm the full support of the\r\nPhilippines for the Secretary-General’s call for concrete\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\naction to create a new momentum for peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe General Assembly’s consideration of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the situation in Africa gives us a\r\nfurther opportunity to consider the important questions\r\nraised in the report. It also allows us to reflect more\r\nprofoundly on ways and means of helping Africa meet the\r\nchallenges that it is facing. The widening of the debate on\r\nthis question in the General Assembly will facilitate an\r\nunderstanding of the problems of the continent and, we\r\nhope, will further sensitize the international community to\r\nthe need to work for the development of our countries.\r\nThe inclusion of this item on the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly also reinforces the action of the Security\r\nCouncil, which last April showed great interest in the\r\nmaintenance of peace in Africa and in contributing to the\r\ndevelopment and growth of the continent.\r\nOur meeting today will also contribute to a better\r\nunderstanding of this huge and multifaceted continent. It\r\nwill help balance the view that some have of Africa by\r\nrecalling that that ancient continent in which young States\r\nare developing is also a land of hope and of the future that\r\naspires to contribute to global civilization and to make its\r\nmark on the coming century. The security problems that\r\naffect certain regions of Africa continue, of course, to be a\r\nsource of concern. The consequences of these problems are\r\noften tragic and create intolerable situations whose first\r\nvictims are civilians. The cost and the damage caused by\r\nthese scourges consume enormous amounts of human and\r\nfinancial resources that could be used for the development\r\nof the continent.\r\nEven if fratricidal wars are reaching alarming\r\nproportions in some regions, we should not forget that\r\npolitical stability, which is linked to the breakdown of the\r\nsocial fabric, especially along ethnic lines, is not a problem\r\npeculiar to Africa.\r\nMy country believes that the United Nations has a\r\nfundamental role to play in finding solutions to intra-State\r\nconflicts. This means that all the structures and institutions\r\nof the United Nations should coordinate their activities\r\neffectively and should be in a position to respond\r\nappropriately to the needs that arise.\r\nWe applaud the efforts of the Secretary-General in that\r\nrespect. It goes without saying that the contribution of\r\nMember States is vital to ensure that this work is\r\nsuccessful. However, cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity is crucial\r\nin this area. Experience has shown that the establishment\r\nof structures for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution by that pan-African organization requires major\r\nresources, given the activities that must be carried out. In\r\nthis connection, the delegation of Tunisia welcomes the\r\nmeasures recently recommended by the Security Council.\r\nWe believe that prevention should be at the centre of\r\nefforts to preserve peace and security in Africa.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping, we believe that the\r\nmodalities for cooperation advocated by the Security\r\nCouncil to strengthen the capacity of Africa in that\r\nrespect deserve to be developed in practice. The idea of\r\na partnership between troop-contributing countries and\r\nthose that can provide equipment is a useful way to\r\nincrease the participation of African States in\r\npeacekeeping operations. It is important to stress here the\r\nvital role of the United Nations in launching these\r\noperations and defining their mandate, as well as in\r\nfinancing them, in keeping with the primary responsibility\r\nof the Security Council in this area.\r\nThe various initiatives to strengthen the\r\npeacekeeping capacity of Africa should therefore be\r\nviewed positively. We should like to stress that the\r\ncontinuation and development of these initiatives require\r\nus to take account of the parameters established by the\r\nAfrican States as well as the objectives outlined by the\r\nOAU.\r\nMy country’s delegation also believes the effort for\r\nconflict prevention should not be confined to security\r\nmatters but must also encompass socio-economic issues.\r\nTensions and crises often lead to the outbreak of conflicts\r\nthat originate in the persistence of poverty,\r\nmarginalization and deteriorating living conditions.\r\nQuite clearly, without development we can hardly\r\nhope to reduce conflicts whose origin often lies in\r\npoverty, marginalization and discrimination. Economic\r\ngrowth alone certainly cannot guarantee stability or social\r\npeace, but without it there can be no lasting improvement\r\nin the economic and social situation in our countries.\r\nIn order to achieve this, and despite the difficult\r\ninternational environment, African countries have adopted\r\nstrong economic measures through stabilization\r\nprogrammes and structural adjustment programmes. These\r\nprogrammes have all had a multidimensional aspect\r\nencompassing, inter alia, economic and commercial\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nliberalization measures, improving financial management\r\nand modernizing taxation systems.\r\nNevertheless, we would stress that many African\r\ncountries that have established Draconian structural\r\nadjustment programmes have often had to slash their social\r\nexpenditures and therefore reduce basic social services. The\r\nnecessary economic restructuring has led to the recovery\r\nthat we are now seeing in Africa after 20 or so years of\r\nrecession. However, this improvement will remain fragile\r\nunless backed up by the international community through\r\nsufficient infusions of secure resources and a favourable\r\nexternal context.\r\nAccordingly, the countries of the South can give\r\nconsiderable assistance to Africa through technology\r\ntransfers, training, joint ventures and investment. The\r\nsolidarity of the countries of the South was made clear at\r\nthe Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment and the Asia-Africa Forum on experience\r\nsharing.\r\nWork done now by the industrialized countries and the\r\nUnited Nations system should, we think, be much more\r\nvigorous in terms of official development assistance,\r\ninvestment, access to markets and dealing with the problem\r\nof indebtedness.\r\nTurning specifically to the problem of indebtedness, it\r\nis widely acknowledged that it has serious consequences for\r\ninvestment and new growth. Not only does it make it\r\nimpossible for public investment in physical infrastructure\r\nand human resources, but it discourages private investment,\r\nincluding foreign investment. Need I recall here that the\r\nexternal debt of African countries, expressed as a\r\npercentage of exports and gross domestic product, is the\r\nhighest of all developing regions?\r\nIn this context, Tunisia appreciates the initiatives taken\r\nby some countries to cancel the debts of African countries.\r\nBecause of the complex situation existing in our continent,\r\nwe believe that urgent measures for Africa should be taken\r\nto alleviate the external debt, as well as to promote\r\neconomic diversification and to mobilize additional\r\nfinancial resources both by means of official development\r\nassistance and by encouraging the private sector to invest\r\nin Africa.\r\nMy delegation welcomes this debate on the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the situation in Africa. The high\r\nlevel of the discussion is a good sign that our work will\r\nconclude positively.\r\nMr. Menkerios (Eritrea): In speaking on this agenda\r\nitem, it is quite fitting to start by commending the\r\nSecretary-General for his insightful report on the root\r\ncauses of conflict and the measures necessary to ensure\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa.\r\nAlthough the causes and remedies of Africa’s political\r\nand economic problems are well presented in the report,\r\nit is important to highlight and expound upon some of the\r\nkey elements of these problems and solutions.\r\nThe causes of Africa’s problems, both political and\r\neconomic, have external and internal roots, and a proper\r\nunderstanding of these is necessary when looking for\r\nsolutions. The colonial experience left a legacy of ills for\r\nthe continent. The depletion and decimation of material\r\nand human resources undermined, if not destroyed, social\r\ninstitutions; not so well-fitted — indeed, implanted —\r\npolitico-economic systems; and a host of other injustices\r\ncontributed to a handicapped start for African countries at\r\nthe time of independence. Overcoming this legacy has\r\nproved very difficult for African peoples and\r\nGovernments, especially when the attempt was\r\ncomplicated by the unequal relationship which, of\r\nnecessity, ensued with the economically developed\r\ncountries, leading to Africa’s marginalization in all\r\nspheres of international development. This, I believe,\r\nneeds to be well understood and accepted, and conscious\r\nefforts made, both internally and externally, to\r\ncompensate for or correct it through time.\r\nWe would, however, be looking for excuses for our\r\nfailures — incorrect and irresponsible — if we Africans\r\nwere to believe and say that all our problems were caused\r\nby factors beyond our doing and control, and if we\r\nexpected their solutions to come from outside as well. It\r\nhas been more than 30 years since decolonization in most\r\nof Africa, and corrupt, dictatorial and inept regimes in\r\nmany African countries are responsible for preventing\r\nAfrican peoples from making any headway in any aspect\r\nof society during this period. This has also affected the\r\ninternational attitude and response to Africa. Any change\r\nin the hitherto existing international attitude and response\r\nof neglect to Africa can come only as a result of positive\r\nchanges inside Africa itself.\r\nSuch positive changes have of course begun to arrive\r\nin many parts of Africa, especially during the last decade.\r\nResponsible regimes have appeared, committed to\r\nbuilding democratic institutions, adopting development\r\nstrategies based on their peoples’ needs and their human\r\nand material resource capability, enhancing especially\r\ntheir human resource capacity and, most importantly,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nworking for regional cooperation and integration. This\r\nprocess of change, I believe, is well set. Despite the\r\nenormous problems that are being encountered along the\r\nway, it can and will only continue forward for it represents\r\nthe positive aspirations of a growing number of Africa’s\r\npeoples that are no longer prepared to accept being\r\nexcluded from the determination of their own destiny.\r\nParallel with the eruption of conflicts — mostly with\r\nroot causes associated with past ills and economic\r\ndeprivation — and the appearance of famines and other\r\nhuman disasters in many areas, Africa’s continental and\r\nregional capacity to work in a concerted manner for peace,\r\nstability and economic development has increased. The\r\nsustained higher rate of economic development achieved in\r\nmany countries, which can be taken as the best indicator of\r\nimprovement in all the other aspects of social life, also\r\nattests to the continuity of the process of positive change in\r\nAfrica.\r\nBut although this process may be expected to\r\ncontinue, the speed with which it can continue depends on\r\nmany crucial factors. It all starts with changes made within\r\neach country in the direction of establishing and\r\nstrengthening democratic institutions, adopting and\r\nimplementing appropriate, self-reliant development\r\nstrategies, eliminating corruption, ensuring the democratic\r\nparticipation of the population in all aspects of their\r\nnation’s life, et cetera. Fostering regional cooperation both\r\nin establishing peace and stability and in working for\r\neconomic development is of great importance. Partnership\r\nfrom the international community in these endeavours —\r\nsupport to enhance capacity, increased investment, the\r\nopening up of international markets for mutual benefit, and\r\nopening up other doors for Africa’s integration into the\r\nworld economy — is also essential.\r\nMuch more could be said on these points, but I\r\nbelieve this has been adequately done in the comprehensive\r\nreport of the Secretary-General. What remains to be\r\nachieved is a genuine and concerted effort to implement the\r\nrecommendations that have been made. Eritrea fully\r\nendorses the basic recommendations made in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, and pledges to do its part to ensure\r\nthat Africa’s regeneration becomes a reality.\r\nConflicts exist today in several parts of Africa, and\r\nmuch has been said about these conflict and their resolution\r\nduring the general debate at the present session, as well as\r\nin other forums. One of these conflicts is the border conflict\r\nbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia, which remains unresolved\r\nbecause of the refusal of the Ethiopian Government to talk\r\nabout a peaceful solution unless and until Eritrea\r\nunilaterally and unconditionally withdraws from territories\r\nthat Ethiopia claims but that are within Eritrea’s\r\nestablished borders.\r\nOne does not erase the fact that one is an aggressor\r\nby simply accusing the victim of being the aggressor.\r\nThat, unfortunately, is what Ethiopian representatives here\r\nhave tried to do during this entire session. Eritrea has\r\nmade it abundantly clear that the sad and unnecessary\r\nconflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia started as a result of\r\nEthiopia’s violation of Eritrean sovereignty and Ethiopia’s\r\noccupation of Eritrean territories that are clearly within\r\nEritrea’s borders as established during the colonial period.\r\nEritrea has not only invited independent verification of\r\nthis fact from the outset, but has also presented concrete\r\nproposals for the peaceful and legal solution of the issue.\r\nEritrea remains ready for dialogue with the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire\r\nand cessation of hostilities, demilitarization of all disputed\r\nareas throughout the area of the border between the two\r\ncountries, and the demarcation of the common border on\r\nthe basis of recognition of the inviolability of boundaries\r\nestablished during the colonial period.\r\nIt is disappointing that the Ethiopian Government\r\nrejects any proposal for a peaceful solution short of\r\nEritrea’s unconditional acceptance of its ultimatum on\r\nunilateral withdrawal from disputed territories. It threatens\r\nto use force unless its ultimatum is bowed to.\r\nI would like to pledge the continuing firm\r\ncommitment of the State of Eritrea to seeking a peaceful\r\nand legal solution and to condemning the use of force. I\r\nwould like to invite the representative of Ethiopia to make\r\na similar commitment before the General Assembly.\r\nClearly, it is the rejection of these principles and\r\nadherence to the threat or use of force that constitutes\r\naggression. Clearly too, succumbing to this threat or use\r\nof force would constitute appeasement.\r\nThere has been adequate independent testimony to\r\nEthiopia’s violation of the human rights of Eritreans and\r\nEthiopians of Eritrean origin, and of the humane\r\ntreatment of Ethiopians in Eritrea. Throwing the mud that\r\nyou find on your own face, which is what we have heard\r\nthe Ethiopian representative doing here, cannot reverse the\r\nfacts.\r\nI would like to reiterate that Eritrea is prepared to do\r\nits share to ensure peace and stability with its neighbour,\r\nEthiopia, with the rest of the Horn of Africa region, and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nwith all of Africa, and to work for the implementation of\r\nthe essential proposals made in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 45/6 of 16 October 1990, I now call\r\non the observer for the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross.\r\nMs. Junod (International Committee of the Red\r\nCross) (interpretation from French): As members know, the\r\nmission of the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\n(ICRC) is to prevent and relieve the suffering caused by\r\nwar. Sadly, Africa is the main arena for its activities today.\r\nThe ICRC has 19 operational and regional delegations and\r\nsome 3,000 staff on that continent, and its work in Africa\r\naccounts for almost half of its operational budget. We\r\ntherefore feel closely involved with the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa, which\r\nreflects a number of our own concerns. We had the\r\nprivilege of taking the floor before the Security Council\r\nduring the open debate that took place last spring, and now\r\nwe think it important to make a brief contribution in this\r\nplenary meeting of the General Assembly, which represents\r\nthe entire community of States.\r\nWe must deplore the human suffering caused by the\r\neruption of new conflicts since the publication of the\r\nreport — in Guinea-Bissau, between Ethiopia and Eritrea,\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, most\r\nrecently, in Lesotho — adding to the already heavy toll.\r\nWorking for conflict victims is the raison d’être of the\r\nICRC. Today more than ever, this work would be\r\ninconceivable without the ongoing dialogue the ICRC\r\nmaintains not only with the United Nations but also with\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU), which has also\r\ngranted it observer status. This close cooperation, especially\r\nin the framework of the OAU Commission of Twenty on\r\nRefugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in Africa, is\r\nindispensable for gaining a better understanding of the\r\ncontexts in which we have to operate. That understanding\r\nis further enhanced by a valuable network of contacts,\r\nwhich are required to increase our effectiveness.\r\nWe shall confine our remarks today to two main areas:\r\nreaffirmation of the relevance of international humanitarian\r\nlaw, and the need for genuinely humanitarian action to\r\nassist victims of conflict, action that prepares the ground for\r\nreconstruction and creates the conditions necessary for\r\nsustainable development.\r\nLike the Secretary-General, we have noted the sharp\r\ndecline in the level of adherence to humanitarian norms\r\nin crisis situations. In view of the abuses and atrocities\r\ncommitted against civilian victims of conflict, particularly\r\nwomen and children, and against refugees, displaced\r\npersons, detainees and prisoners, it is absolutely essential\r\nto restore respect for universal humanitarian principles by\r\nall those who bear weapons. Furthermore, it should be\r\nremembered that the non-governmental actors appearing\r\non the scene in increasing numbers are also duty-bound\r\nto observe minimum humanitarian standards.\r\nThe ICRC can therefore only endorse such a clear\r\ndiagnosis and such a pressing appeal in these times\r\nmarked by the proliferation of conflicts in countries where\r\nState structures have collapsed and by the emergence of\r\nstruggles aimed at asserting identity of one kind or\r\nanother in which the annihilation of a group of people\r\nregarded as rivals is the principal objective. A new\r\ndifficulty has been added to this, one associated with what\r\nwe refer to as the privatization of war and the emergence\r\nof forces which depend on private groups or individuals\r\nover whom State authorities have little or no influence.\r\nAfrica is rich in traditions imbued with profound\r\nhuman values which it shares with humanitarian law and\r\nwhich can be found in the codes that have traditionally\r\ngoverned the conduct of hostilities. The challenge before\r\nus all is therefore to revive those values, especially\r\namong the young — the vital force which makes up three\r\nquarters of the continent’s population. This mobilization\r\nis a long-term preventive effort to make everyone aware\r\nof the fact that, whatever the situation, there are limits to\r\nviolence and that neither those who order acts of violence,\r\nnor those who carry them out, nor those who tolerate\r\nthem can say “I did not know”. All the Member States of\r\nthe United Nations have undertaken not only to respect,\r\nbut also to ensure respect for, the humanitarian law\r\ntreaties. This is therefore a universal collective obligation\r\nwith regard to all conflict victims. It is everyone’s\r\nbusiness.\r\nIn this regard, the African countries have embarked\r\non a process of legislative reform with the technical\r\nassistance of the ICRC’s Advisory Service in order to\r\nincorporate into their national legislation the measures\r\nnecessary to implement humanitarian law, and in\r\nparticular to prosecute the perpetrators of violations.\r\nIt is unfortunately a well-known fact that war\r\ncriminals usually manage to avoid being brought to\r\njustice. The creation by the Security Council of the ad\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nhoc Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda\r\nwas a first step in criminal prosecutions. The adoption in\r\nRome of the Statute of the International Criminal Court is\r\nnow another reason to hope, especially because it covers\r\nviolations committed during internal armed conflicts and\r\nincludes war crimes such as the recruitment of children\r\nunder the age of 15 into armed conflicts, rape and sexual\r\nslavery.\r\nThere are other factors that give us every reason to\r\nexpect that the number of victims will decline in the future.\r\nOf the 47 parties to the Ottawa Convention banning anti-\r\npersonnel mines, 13 are African States. In fact, we learned\r\nthis morning that a new State, Guinea, has been added to\r\nthat list. We have no doubt that many others will follow\r\ntheir lead in the near future. Subsequently, all will have to\r\njoin forces to take practical measures to eliminate\r\nlandmines.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General raises the issue of\r\nthe proliferation of light weapons, which without a doubt\r\naccount for innumerable violations of humanitarian law.\r\nThe proposal put forward by Mali for a moratorium on the\r\nmanufacture, export and import of light weapons in West\r\nAfrica is a pioneering initiative in this respect.\r\nThe Secretary-General has stressed the need for the\r\ninternational community to use all the mechanisms at its\r\ndisposal in a consistent and coordinated manner to find\r\ncomprehensive solutions to conflicts. Such solutions must\r\ntake into account political, social and economic factors\r\nwithout which lasting results cannot be achieved. Indeed,\r\nthe ICRC notes with increasing concern the tendency shown\r\nby certain States in recent years to resort to humanitarian\r\naction instead of taking political or even military action\r\nwhen it is appropriate within the framework of relevant\r\ninternational instruments. Central Africa is a good example\r\nof this.\r\nHowever, nothing can replace the political will to\r\nresolve the underlying causes of conflict and the tragedies\r\nthey cause by using the whole range of legitimate means\r\navailable, including restoring law and order. Humanitarian\r\nassistance cannot be a substitute. Supplying aid to the\r\nvictims of conflict is the business of organizations whose\r\naims and working methods are genuinely humanitarian. The\r\nissue of the safety of the resident, refugee and displaced\r\npopulations of the Great Lakes region provides us with a\r\nprime illustration of this and we are seeing the tragic\r\nconsequences today.\r\nAcknowledging the need for a strategic approach,\r\npolitical, military and humanitarian players therefore have\r\nto harmonize their activities. They must seek synergies\r\nbetween their activities with due regard for their\r\ninterdependence, but also for their respective mandates\r\nand specific roles. However, this approach must not\r\nsubject all humanitarian action to political objectives at\r\nthe expense of the principles of humanity, impartiality,\r\nneutrality and independence.\r\nThe best interests of victims remain at the core of\r\nthe concerns and operations of the ICRC. For example, as\r\nthe Secretary-General points out, the imposition of\r\nsanctions by the international community can affect\r\nunforeseen victims. Furthermore, we have always spoken\r\nin favour of exemptions on humanitarian grounds. We are\r\npleased to note in this connection that more sensitive\r\nindicators for assessing and even anticipating the impact\r\nof sanctions on the population are being developed.\r\nAll of this is not to say that humanitarian action has\r\nno political dimension or that it never has any impact on\r\nthe course of a conflict. It is true that the presence of\r\nhumanitarian organizations has sometimes had adverse\r\neffects by unintentionally serving the purposes of war. In\r\nthis regard the ICRC shares the Secretary-General’s\r\nconcern about emergency situations which attract a\r\nmultitude of aid agencies with divergent objectives and\r\nworking methods. In such circumstances it is essential\r\nthat these agencies harmonize their action and avoid\r\nduplication of efforts. Moreover, this is vital for the safety\r\nof all concerned.\r\nThe report highlights the need to integrate and\r\nestablish links between the concepts and the actions\r\ninvolved in assistance, rehabilitation, reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment. The ICRC fully endorses this opinion. In its\r\naid operations it has opted where possible for an approach\r\nwhose ultimate purpose is to help the individuals and\r\ncommunities concerned to regain their autonomy and to\r\nfree themselves of dependence on outside assistance by\r\ninvolving them as closely as possible in the planning and\r\nimplementation of programmes.\r\nNumerous efforts are being undertaken in this regard\r\nin various parts of Africa to restore the means of\r\nproduction to population groups which have suffered the\r\neffects of war in such areas as agriculture, animal\r\nhusbandry, fisheries and handicrafts. Similarly, the ICRC\r\nis running programmes to restore basic health services, to\r\nfit those disabled by war with prosthetic devices and to\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nrepair water-supply networks and sewage and waste\r\ndisposal systems.\r\nIn conducting its operations the ICRC mobilizes all\r\navailable local partners. For both the ICRC and the\r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\r\nSocieties, the network of African national organizations\r\nprovides invaluable support. Their volunteers often work in\r\nextremely difficult conditions. Many have lost their lives in\r\nthe course of their duties on the African continent.\r\nProviding aid without taking steps to provide\r\nprotection would be absurd and could even be counter-\r\nproductive. Any operation carried out on behalf of victims\r\nof conflicts must not only bring them the material\r\nassistance they need but also protect them from the dangers\r\nthat prolong and exacerbate their suffering, while at the\r\nsame time preserving their human dignity.\r\nThe aim of the ICRC’s protection activities is\r\nessentially to ensure respect for the lives and physical\r\nintegrity of individuals. This endeavour is inseparable from\r\nthe work of defending human rights, whose ultimate\r\npurpose is the smooth functioning of civil society and the\r\nexercise of civil, political, economic, social and cultural\r\nrights.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin the debate on this agenda item.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second intervention\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Yimer (Ethiopia): Since last Friday the Assembly\r\nhas been discussing the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa.\r\nThis is a very important topic, and the reason for the\r\ninscription of this item on the agenda is that there are\r\nconflicts in Africa. That is the reality. We are not\r\ndiscussing this issue in the abstract, because there are\r\nconcrete conflict situations in Africa, and we cannot gloss\r\nover them in discussing this agenda item.\r\nOne of the conflict situations in Africa today is the\r\none between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General was issued on 13 April 1998; almost\r\nexactly a month later, Ethiopia was subjected to an\r\nunprovoked act of aggression by Eritrea. That is the\r\nreality.\r\nThis afternoon the representative of Eritrea presented\r\nthe usual rehash of the Eritrean attempts to hoodwink\r\ninternational opinion on the character of the conflict. This\r\ndoes not come as a surprise to us. Towards the end of his\r\nstatement he said that there was a border conflict between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea. But the reason for the conflict today\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea is not the border dispute. It\r\nis aggression committed by a State Member of the United\r\nNations against another to solve a border dispute — the\r\nuse of force to resolve a border dispute, in violation of\r\nArticle 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United\r\nNations. So Ethiopia is the victim of aggression.\r\nThe aggressor historically presents itself as the\r\nvictim; this is a familiar ploy, which we have heard again\r\nthis afternoon. Again, that does not come as a surprise to\r\nus. We are not alone in saying that force was used to\r\nsettle a border dispute. Since 12 May 1998, a day that\r\nwill live in infamy, as we said earlier, there have been\r\nattempts to resolve this problem, although Ethiopia has\r\nnever responded in kind.\r\nThere have been attempts by third parties, beginning\r\nwith the United States and Rwanda and up to the\r\nCommittee of Ambassadors of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), who submitted their report recently\r\non the conflict. None of these third parties has ever\r\nindicated that Ethiopia had committed an act of\r\naggression against Eritrea. On the contrary, they have said\r\nin clear terms who was where before 12 May 1998. This\r\nis clear to everyone, including the Eritrean aggressor.\r\nNow if in addressing this body today we are saying\r\nsomething we have said before and which is familiar, it\r\nis because Eritrea has used this ploy — saying that there\r\nis a border conflict — repeatedly. We have always said\r\nthat the border conflict can be resolved only by peaceful\r\nmeans, not by the use of force. If someone uses force to\r\nresolve a border dispute, then the victim has every right,\r\nunder Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nin exercise of the right of self-defence, to reverse the\r\naggression. I must put that in terms that are as clear as\r\npossible, and not for the first time. We are not addressing\r\nthis to Eritrea, because there is no point. We are\r\naddressing this to the international community.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nThe other familiar ploy is that Eritrea has submitted\r\nconcrete proposals. But those concrete proposals happen to\r\nbe at variance with the proposals submitted by third parties\r\nin the past. The familiar proposals are cessation of\r\nhostilities, a ceasefire, demilitarization and a plethora of\r\nother proposals to appear peace-loving.\r\nWe are not going to reward this aggression. We are\r\nnot going to appease the aggressor. We have never done\r\nthat at any point in our history. We are not going to follow\r\nthis path, because it is not a path to peace; it is a path to\r\nappeasement. Ethiopia has never refused dialogue with\r\nEritrea. We have said that we will engage in dialogue only\r\nwhen the aggression is reversed; then we will resolve it\r\npeacefully, by any means, in any forum. There is no\r\nshortage of forums to settle border disputes, because border\r\ndisputes are numerous throughout the world.\r\nThere is no point in rehashing the same stories to\r\nappear peace-loving, as I said earlier. The best thing to do\r\nwould be to accept what the third parties politely said: that\r\nthere should be a return to the status quo ante of 12 May\r\n1998, and at that point there is a procedure proposed by\r\nthose third parties to be set in motion once the status quo\r\nante has been restored.\r\nThose proposals were supported by the Organization\r\nof African Unity. They were supported strongly by the\r\nSecurity Council. Then the OAU, within the framework of\r\nthese proposals, started its own process. And the last\r\nproposal in the most recent report of the OAU Committee\r\nof Ambassadors was — we have it here in black and white;\r\nwe have the document for everyone to see — that before\r\n12 May 1998 Eritrean troops were within Eritrea, and after\r\n12 May 1988 they were within Ethiopian territory, because\r\nthose territories were administered by Ethiopia before that\r\nday. And what happened between 6 and 12 May constitutes\r\n“the fundamental element of the crisis”. That is what they\r\nsaid.\r\nDoes that indicate that Ethiopia was the aggressor? On\r\nthe contrary. Maybe they never used the word “aggressor”,\r\nbecause in the international community we do not call a\r\nspade a spade. But we will call a spade a spade, here and\r\neverywhere, however much the Eritrean regime tries to\r\npresent itself as a victim, because all aggressors throughout\r\nhistory have presented themselves as victims. We propose,\r\ntherefore, that the aggression should be reversed, and then\r\nwe will sit down and negotiate a peaceful resolution of the\r\ncrisis.\r\nThat is the bottom line. It is futile to try to\r\nhoodwink others or to engage in duplicity to change the\r\nreality that the Eritrean aggression continues. It continues\r\neven as I speak. But we have been bending over\r\nbackwards for the last several months, and we will\r\ncontinue to do so with a view to a peaceful resolution.\r\nBut we will never succumb to aggression.\r\nMr. Menkerios (Eritrea): I would hate to turn this\r\nAssembly, which is discussing the question of conflict\r\nand economic problems in Africa and how to resolve\r\nthem, into a forum more like a court, where declarations\r\nare made to an audience that does not have direct access\r\nto the truth.\r\nI would like to take the Ethiopian representative at\r\nhis word. I agree with him that, actually, it is normal for\r\nthe aggressor to appear as a victim.\r\nInstead of repeating these statements here to each\r\nother and to this Assembly, we challenge the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment and the Ethiopian representative to make it\r\nexplicit here that we should have an independent\r\ninvestigation of who is actually the aggressor and who is\r\nnot — who is in whose land and who is not. We still\r\nstand by that invitation.\r\nRegarding the question of a peaceful solution, here\r\nagain we have heard the Ethiopian representative continue\r\nto misrepresent the fact that there have been attempts in\r\nthe past at facilitation in which political recommendations\r\nwere made — not recommendations based on the\r\ninvestigation of facts. It is true that we demanded an\r\ninvestigation of the facts on the ground, and then that\r\nthere be concrete proposals. And this is exactly what the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) heads of State are\r\ndoing right now.\r\nIf there were a finalized recommendation that the\r\nOAU had accepted and did not see any reason to pursue,\r\nthen there would have been no reason for the team of\r\nesteemed heads of State in Africa to send ambassadors to\r\ninvestigate the facts on the ground and then to examine\r\nthese facts and come up with proposals for a solution.\r\nThese heads of State have just invited both leaders — the\r\nleaders of the two countries — to come to Ouagadougou\r\nwithin the next few days, or perhaps a week or two, to a\r\nmeeting to listen, to present their findings, to present their\r\nproposals. We have accepted and cooperated with this\r\nprocess.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nIt is unreasonable, irrational even, to continue to insist\r\nthat there have been recommendations that everybody has\r\naccepted and everybody has finalized, and that it is only\r\nEritrea that has not complied with them. This has been\r\nrepeated many, many times.\r\nEritrea again reiterates that it is ready to cooperate\r\nwith the peace efforts of Africa, of the OAU — peace\r\nefforts in support of this attempt, this effort by Africa. And\r\nthis process is continuing. We hope that the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment will do the same as well.\r\nMr. Yimer (Ethiopia): There is a saying, “Something\r\nis better than nothing”. In the statement in exercise of right\r\nof reply by the representative of Eritrea, at least we have\r\nheard something. He referred to facilitation. He referred to\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) process. He\r\nreferred to the eminent heads of State of the OAU. He\r\nreferred to the committee of ambassadors who, as I have\r\nsaid, have presented proposals. All this was glossed over\r\nwhen they were mentioned in his main statement. That is\r\nwhy I said this is an improvement in Eritrea’s behaviour, at\r\nleast as far as we know it up to today.\r\nThe representative of Eritrea said that this body does\r\nnot have access to the truth. The truth is contained in\r\ndocuments. The documents are available. We can make\r\nthem available to everybody so that they can make their\r\nown judgments. It is not abstract. It is not difficult to find.\r\nSo it is an utter distortion to say that this body has no\r\naccess to the truth. The international community can have\r\naccess to the truth. It has access to the truth.\r\nHe also talked about an independent investigation. The\r\nindependent investigation has been done by the committee\r\nof ambassadors, which has submitted a report. Those\r\nambassadors have submitted a report to their Foreign\r\nMinisters; their Foreign Ministers have presented it to the\r\ntwo Governments; and of course the heads of State are\r\npreparing to present their recommendations. So I hope we\r\nare not talking about the independent investigation that the\r\nEritrean Government is trying to establish, because they\r\nhave been laying down conditions. One condition — they\r\nhave said, “We have concrete proposals of our own”, to go\r\nalong with all this cessation of hostilities, ceasefire,\r\ndemilitarization. Then we have this proposal, this idea now\r\nthat there should be an independent investigation. At the\r\nsame time, and in the same breath, they are saying and we\r\nare hearing — at least, as I said, it is something — that\r\nthere is a process going on, but it is not yet consummated.\r\nThat is a fact. It is not yet consummated. But every step of\r\nthe way there have been conclusions. There have been\r\nconclusions, and that is a reality. Whether Eritrea likes it\r\nor not, these conclusions are stated in black and white,\r\nand they have rejected them. We have accepted them. So\r\nthe improvement is there now, but the situation will not\r\nchange, because when it comes to taking concrete actions\r\nwe don’t see anything coming from the Eritrean\r\nGovernment.\r\nI am going to repeat myself this afternoon. We are\r\nsaying we are prepared to go all the way to solve this\r\nproblem peacefully. But solving this problem peacefully\r\ndoes not mean accepting aggression, allowing the\r\naggressor to enjoy the fruits of aggression. That is what\r\nI want to stress again and again. Nobody should be under\r\nany illusion here. And the Eritrean Government is not\r\nunder any illusion that we are going to accept the\r\nconsequences of the 12 May 1998 aggression. The\r\nprocess is there. That process will have to result in the\r\nreversal of the aggression. Then we will sit down and\r\nnegotiate however long it might take to settle the border\r\ndispute, the existence of which we have never denied.\r\nMr. Menkerios (Eritrea): I simply want to remind\r\nthis Assembly that I have just heard the threat of the use\r\nof force. This threat has continually been made by the\r\nleaders of Ethiopia: that Eritrea must unilaterally\r\nwithdraw from lands that are in dispute, lands that are\r\nquite clearly within Eritrean boundaries but the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment claims them as theirs; and unless we do so\r\nunconditionally, unilaterally, they will use force to make\r\nus do so. That is exactly what we heard from the\r\nEthiopian representative right now.\r\nThat is the crux of the matter from the beginning,\r\nfrom the outset — that you use force, and then the other\r\nside defends itself, and simply because you cry out\r\n“aggression”, you expect everybody to accept that as\r\naggression. It is the use of force and the threat of the use\r\nof force that we have just heard again that has become\r\nthe crux of the problem. Eritrea has rejected the use of\r\nforce, reiterates again that it rejects the use of force, is\r\nprepared for a peaceful and legal solution to this problem\r\nand is cooperating with the attempts of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) to come up with a report.\r\nI again challenge the representative of Ethiopia, who\r\nsaid that there are reports, and that these reports are\r\navailable to this body, that finalized reports have come\r\nfrom the OAU peace process. We are still in the process.\r\nWe are still waiting for the heads of State to come out\r\nnot only with a full report on their investigations but also\r\nwith their proposals for a peaceful solution. As we have\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nsaid, we have cooperated in the past, and we will continue\r\nto cooperate in the future in search of a peaceful solution.\r\nBut there are threats every day, guns actually pointed\r\nat our head, being told every day that Ethiopia has finalized\r\nits preparations for war, that Ethiopia actually is going to\r\nevict us, the Eritreans, out of our own land — lands that\r\nclearly are within Eritrea. We have been saying that we are\r\nready to demilitarize all disputed areas in the interest of a\r\npeaceful solution: demilitarization by both sides of the\r\nentire border, all disputed areas, and we are ready to have\r\nan international monitoring body in this area until we\r\npeacefully demarcate the border.\r\nAll this is very clear to the Ethiopian Government.\r\nDespite this, Ethiopia has made conditions and says that\r\nunless its conditions are unconditionally, unilaterally met by\r\nEritrea, that unless Eritrea withdraws, they will make it do\r\nso by force. And he repeated it again.\r\nWe are prepared to defend our right as well. It is our\r\nduty and right to defend our own territory, as we are doing.\r\nAnd we will continue to do this despite the threats of the\r\nEthiopian Government. But it is these threats, this use of\r\nforce, this reliance on the use of force that really has been\r\nthe crux of the problem from the outset up until now. This\r\nis being repeated every day by Ethiopia’s leaders.\r\nWhat kind of a peaceful atmosphere is this? What kind\r\nof a conducive atmosphere to a peaceful solution of the\r\nissue can this provide? Under intimidation? Under threats\r\nthat are repeated daily by Ethiopia’s leaders?\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nI should like to inform members that a draft resolution\r\non this item will be submitted to the Secretariat at a later\r\ndate.\r\nAgenda item 113\r\nProgramme budget for the biennium 1998-1999\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/53/485)\r\nThe Acting President: If there is no proposal under\r\nrule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly decides not to discuss the report of the\r\nFifth Committee that is before the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Statements will therefore be\r\nlimited to explanations of vote or position.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendation of the Fifth Committee have been made\r\nclear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant\r\nofficial records.\r\nMay I remind Members that under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered\r\nin a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a\r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote\r\nonly once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary\r\nmeeting unless that delegation’s vote in plenary\r\nmeeting is different from its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I also remind delegations that, also in\r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401,\r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that we\r\nare going to proceed to take a decision in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft\r\nresolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in\r\nparagraph 6 of its report.\r\nThe draft resolution is entitled “Analysis of savings\r\nresulting from the improved overall cost-effectiveness\r\nachieved pursuant to the ninth session of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development, including\r\nthe restructuring of the intergovernmental machinery and\r\nthe reform of the Secretariat, as requested by the General\r\nAssembly in its resolution 52/220 of 22 December 1997\r\nand proposals pursuant to General Assembly decision\r\n52/462 of 31 March 1998”. The Fifth Committee adopted\r\nthe draft resolution without a vote.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 36th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 12 October 1998\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the\r\nsame?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 53/3).\r\nThe Acting President: We have thus concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 113.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.\r\n22\r\n"
