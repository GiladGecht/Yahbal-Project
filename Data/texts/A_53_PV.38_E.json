(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mangoaela\r\n(Lesotho), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 158\r\nWorld Solar Programme 1996-2005\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.8)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Zimbabwe to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.8.\r\nMr. Mapuranga (Zimbabwe): Zimbabwe, along with\r\nother Members of the United Nations, proposed the\r\ninclusion of the item on the World Solar Programme 1996-\r\n2005 in the current agenda of the General Assembly. There\r\nis also a draft resolution prepared and circulated on this\r\nitem.\r\nThis item is of particular concern to Zimbabwe, as it\r\nis to many other States Members of the United Nations.\r\nPresident Mugabe is the Chairman of the World Solar\r\nCommission, a body composed of 18 heads of State and\r\nGovernment that, since its establishment in 1994, has\r\noverseen and guided the preparation of the World Solar\r\nProgramme, which it approved in June last year. The\r\nProgramme is before us today in document A/53/395.\r\nThe World Solar Programme 1996-2005, which was\r\nlaunched at the World Solar Summit held in Harare in\r\nSeptember 1996, represents a major effort for the\r\npromotion of all forms of renewable energy — bearing in\r\nmind, here, that the term “solar” is utilized in a generic\r\nsense to encompass other renewable sources of energy.\r\nThe Programme reflects the political will of the 104\r\nnational delegations that attended the World Solar Summit\r\nand constitutes an important contribution to the struggle\r\nfor the achievement of sustainable development.\r\nIt would be useful to briefly observe that, in the\r\nWorld Solar Programme, particular emphasis is placed on\r\nthe mandates and recommendations of both Agenda 21 of\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment — the Earth Summit — of 1992 and the\r\n1981 Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development\r\nand Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of\r\nEnergy. While the Nairobi Programme of Action provided\r\nspecific energy-related policies and programmes in a\r\nnumber of areas, including energy assessment and\r\nplanning, transfer, adoption and application of mature\r\ntechnologies, research, development and demonstration, as\r\nwell as education and training, the Earth Summit also\r\ndiscussed energy and explicitly concluded that energy was\r\nessential to economic and social development and\r\nimproved quality of life. Indeed, the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change relates its\r\nimplementation to the energy policies of the Parties to the\r\nConvention, and energy has received the attention of other\r\nsubsequent major United Nations conferences, including\r\nthe 1994 Global Conference on the Sustainable\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, as one of\r\nthe factors for furthering sustainable development.\r\nTaking into account the recommendations which\r\nemerged from these major conferences, we feel that the\r\npreparatory process which led to the World Solar Summit\r\nand the subsequent adoption of the World Solar Programme\r\nlay on a firm foundation. The Programme was prepared on\r\nthe basis of the outline approved by the Summit and the\r\ncommitments contained in the Harare Declaration on Solar\r\nEnergy and Sustainable Development, also adopted at the\r\nSummit, containing a series of recommendations for actions\r\nto be undertaken at the national and international levels.\r\nThe Programme also contains global, regional and national\r\nrenewable energy projects to be implemented as a joint\r\neffort of Governments, interested and relevant organizations\r\nand agencies, the private sector, international financial\r\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations.\r\nThe implementation of many of the more than 400\r\nhigh-priority national projects is already under way, with\r\ninternational financial assistance of some $400 million\r\nbeing provided. Let me hasten to add, in this regard, that\r\nmany other national projects are being implemented with\r\nnational funding, both public and private, from the\r\nconcerned countries themselves.\r\nWe are convinced that, on the one hand, the increased\r\nutilization of renewable energies — and I mean here solar,\r\nwind, biomass, geothermal, tidal and so forth — will meet\r\nthe increasing concerns of both industrialized and\r\ndeveloping countries with the preservation of the\r\nenvironment and the interests of posterity and future\r\ngenerations. On the other hand, it will address the urgent\r\nneed to provide access to basic energy services, for\r\ncooking, lighting, heating, cooling and so forth, to the more\r\nthan 2 billion people who do not benefit from such an\r\nelementary necessity of life. Many of these men, women\r\nand children live in rural areas, remote regions or island\r\nhabitats where they can only have recourse to solar, wind\r\nand other forms of renewable energies.\r\nOne of the United Nations specialized agencies, the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), has already adopted — at the last\r\nsession of its General Conference in 1997 — a resolution\r\nendorsing the World Solar Programme and inviting all\r\nMember States to contribute to the success of its\r\nimplementation, with special emphasis on education and\r\ntraining. Several successful inter-agency consultations have\r\nbeen organized by the World Solar Commission, and\r\nseveral agreements have already been concluded.\r\nThe President of Zimbabwe and the other heads of\r\nState and Government who are members of the World\r\nSolar Commission believe that the time has now come for\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly to adopt a\r\nresolution in support of the World Solar Programme. The\r\nendorsement of the World Solar Programme by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations would constitute\r\na major contribution to its successful implementation. It\r\nwould also enhance the attainment of the objective of\r\nsustainable development and would constitute a\r\nrecognition of the work of the World Solar Commission\r\nin the promotion of the use of renewable energies. The\r\nstrategic importance of the World Solar Programme to\r\nboth developing and developed countries cannot be\r\noveremphasized.\r\nThe Programme is a tangible demonstration by the\r\nWorld Solar Commission and others that have supported\r\nthe World Solar Summit process that they recognize that\r\nachieving a sustainable energy future is an enormous\r\nchallenge which requires the contribution of all concerned\r\nparties, Governments, the international community, the\r\nprivate sector, academia and non-governmental\r\norganizations. Our major objective in this endeavour\r\nshould be that of a significant shift towards\r\nenvironmentally sound energy sources and technologies,\r\nincluding the expanded use of renewable sources of\r\nenergy.\r\nTurning now to the draft resolution itself, it will be\r\nnoted that the preambular part basically highlights the\r\nmajor mandates which have been the guiding principles\r\nbehind this process: Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration\r\non Environment and Development, the World Solar\r\nSummit itself and the resolution adopted by the UNESCO\r\nGeneral Conference endorsing the World Solar\r\nProgramme. Also noted with appreciation in the\r\npreambular part is the support so far demonstrated by\r\nsome developed countries in this process. The issue of\r\nenergy will be a major topic in the discussions of the\r\nninth session of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in 2001, and that very important fact has\r\nbeen highlighted in this section of the draft resolution.\r\nIn the operative part of the draft resolution, the\r\nguiding role which has been assumed by the World Solar\r\nCommission is taken cognizance of. It is also in this\r\nsection that the General Assembly would endorse the\r\nProgramme and invite all Member States of the United\r\nNations to contribute to its successful implementation.\r\nThe Secretary-General would be invited to take certain\r\nactions, in consultation with UNESCO and in close\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme and other relevant organizations, in order to\r\nensure that the Programme is integrated into the United\r\nNations efforts to bring about sustainable development, to\r\nbring the Programme to the attention of funding and\r\ntechnical assistance sources and seek their contribution to\r\nits implementation and to continue to sensitize and generate\r\ngreater awareness among Member States and international,\r\nregional and national institutions of the strategic importance\r\nof this Programme to the goal of sustainable development.\r\nThe Secretary-General would also be invited to report to\r\nthe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly on the\r\nimplementation of the resolution by the various United\r\nNations entities, with a view to its being considered as an\r\nagenda item.\r\nI am most confident that the noble intentions of this\r\ndraft resolution do not in any way detract from the\r\nprofound objectives of the United Nations regarding the\r\npromotion of sustainable development and the enhancement\r\nof the human condition. I therefore would count on the\r\nsupport, and I dare say the unanimous support, of the\r\nmembers of this Assembly for this important initiative of\r\nthe World Solar Commission, and I take this opportunity to\r\nmake an earnest appeal for substantial sponsorship of the\r\ndraft resolution, which we hope will be adopted without a\r\nvote.\r\nFinally, I am advised by the Secretariat that action on\r\nthe draft resolution now before the General Assembly,\r\nwhich has just been distributed this morning can only be\r\ntaken tomorrow, in order to allow all delegations the\r\nopportunity to read it. But if all delegations have indeed\r\nread it and have no objection to it, my delegation would be\r\npleased if that rule were waived and action were taken this\r\nmorning on the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Khan (India): May we compliment the\r\nrepresentative of the Chairman of the World Solar\r\nCommission, the Permanent Representative of Zimbabwe,\r\nfor his statement, with which we fully associate ourselves,\r\nand for his introduction of the draft resolution on this\r\ncrucial agenda item.\r\nIndia is one of the few countries to have initiated\r\nresearch and development with a view to harnessing new\r\nand renewable energy sources, even before the energy crisis\r\nof 1973. As a result of sustained efforts since then, a\r\nsubstantial research and development and manufacturing\r\nsector has emerged in the country for the design and\r\nproduction of non-conventional energy supply equipment.\r\nWe also have one of the world’s largest programmes\r\nfor renewable energy. To give but a few examples, India\r\nnow generates more than 900 megawatts from wind\r\nenergy, nearly 141 megawatts from small hydroelectric\r\ngenerating plants, over 83 megawatts from biomass and\r\nmore than 28 megawatts per installed square kilometre\r\nfrom solar photovoltaic systems. In addition, we have\r\ninstalled nearly 1 million solar water heating systems and\r\nsolar cookers, which decrease pollution and bring\r\nnutritional benefits.\r\nIndia receives solar energy equivalent to 20\r\nmegawatts per square kilometre of its surface area and is\r\ncommitted to progressively increasing the production and\r\nutilization of new and renewable sources of energy,\r\nespecially solar energy. At present, solar energy is being\r\nutilized through both routes available, namely the solar\r\nthermal route and the solar photovoltaic route. We are\r\nusing solar thermal devices for heating water, cooking,\r\ndrying, water desalination, refrigeration processes,\r\nindustrial process heating and steam generation for\r\nindustrial use, including generation of electricity. By\r\nutilizing solar concentrators and properly designed\r\nreceivers we have been able to achieve steam\r\ntemperatures of up to 1,000 degrees centigrade.\r\nIndigenously developed solar water heaters of capacities\r\nranging from 50 litres to 240,000 litres per day have been\r\ninstalled for domestic, commercial and industrial\r\napplications.\r\nSolar photovoltaic cells have emerged as a useful\r\npower source not only for lighting, pumping of\r\nunderground water and telecommunications, but also as\r\npower plants for meeting the entire electricity needs of\r\nisolated villages, hospitals or lodges. Based on single-\r\ncrystal solar cells made of silicon, several types of these\r\ndevices are now being deployed in India. These include\r\nsolar lanterns, domestic lights, street lights, community\r\nlighting systems, power for telecommunications\r\nequipment installed on our offshore oil exploration and\r\nmining platforms, rural telephone systems and the like.\r\nEnergy-deprived populations mostly live in rural and\r\nremote areas, where extending national power grids would\r\nbe prohibitively expensive both in financial and energy\r\nterms. Solar photovoltaic power is inducing a powerful\r\nrevolution in such areas. On Sagar Island, in our province\r\nof West Bengal, a 26-kilowatt solar photovoltaic plant is\r\nmeeting the entire electricity needs of all 300 homes.\r\nSimilar initiatives are being pursued in villages in\r\nsouthern India.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\nOver the last few years, India has placed increasing\r\nemphasis on producing grid-quality power through the solar\r\nphotovoltaic route. Two 100-kilowatt grid-interactive power\r\nplants have been established in the province of Uttar\r\nPradesh. The private sector has been fully involved in these\r\nprojects, and a 100-kilowatt power generation system has\r\nbeen installed and is being operated in Maharashtra by a\r\nprivate Indian company. Several companies in the private\r\nsector have also installed captive solar photovoltaic power\r\nplants.\r\nSignificant incentives are being extended by the\r\nGovernment to the private sector and individual citizens in\r\norder to promote the use of solar energy through a separate\r\nfinancing agency, the Indian Renewable Energy\r\nDevelopment Agency. Solar energy equipment shops known\r\nas “Aditya” are being established in major cities and towns,\r\nin collaboration with manufacturers’ associations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nAt the same time, market orientation is being imparted\r\nto make renewable energy programmes commercially viable\r\nand sustainable. To that end, limited budgetary funds are\r\nused only for selected demonstration projects.\r\nIt is therefore natural that India has been a member of\r\nthe World Solar Commission since its inception in 1994,\r\nunder the chairmanship of President Robert Mugabe, and\r\nhas actively participated in the World Solar Summit\r\nprocess. The personal representative of the Prime Minister\r\nof India attended the World Solar Summit in Harare on 16\r\nand 17 September 1996. Subsequently, India also\r\nparticipated in the second meeting of the World Solar\r\nCommission, which approved the World Solar Programme\r\nfor the decade 1996-2005. Under the Programme, we will\r\nbe implementing eight projects, including those of research\r\nand development, institutional improvement, capacity-\r\nbuilding, the generation of grid-quality power from solar\r\nenergy, the decentralized use of renewable energy, and the\r\nconstruction of a 200-kilowatt solar power plant at Leh and\r\nanother 100-kilowatt solar power plant at Nyomo.\r\nIn the spirit of South-South cooperation, India has\r\nbeen willing to share its developmental experience and\r\nexpertise with other developing countries. It is the\r\ncoordinator of the solar energy applications project of the\r\nGroup of Fifteen developing nations and has been\r\npromoting increased use of new and renewable sources of\r\nenergy through its Technical and Economic Cooperation\r\nProgramme.\r\nWe are convinced that fulfilling basic human needs\r\nand improving the quality of life are the main objectives\r\nof any developmental process. Energy is an essential\r\ncomponent of economic and social growth. It is therefore\r\na matter of serious concern that nearly 40 per cent of the\r\nworld’s people have an inadequate energy supply for their\r\ndaily needs. Support for and promotion of efforts to\r\nredress this inequitable and untenable situation must\r\nremain one of the priorities of the international\r\ncommunity. We therefore commend the draft resolution\r\nsubmitted by Zimbabwe, which we have co-sponsored, for\r\nadoption by the Assembly.\r\nMr. Salleh (Malaysia): My delegation wishes to\r\nmake a statement in support of the draft resolution on the\r\nWorld Solar Programme 1996-2005, which was\r\nintroduced by the delegation of Zimbabwe. The Prime\r\nMinister of Malaysia, The Honourable Dato’ Seri\r\nMahathir Mohamad, is a member of the World Solar\r\nCommission and participated in the World Solar Summit\r\nheld in Harare in September 1996. The World Solar\r\nProgramme 1996-2005 was launched during that Summit.\r\nMalaysia fully endorses the Programme, the text of which\r\nis annexed to document A/53/395.\r\nThe World Solar Programme 1996-2005 embodies\r\nan important step forward in encouraging the wider use of\r\nall forms of renewable energy. The Programme has been\r\nconceived as a concrete follow-up to the\r\nrecommendations of the Rio Earth Summit. It provides a\r\ncomprehensive basis for an important plan to sensitize\r\nGovernments, intergovernmental organizations, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, financial institutions, the\r\nprivate sector, academia and others concerned on the need\r\nto support the development and utilization of renewable\r\nenergy for sustainable development.\r\nMy delegation would like to express Malaysia’s\r\nsincere appreciation to the President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, Mr. Robert Mugabe, for his able leadership of\r\nthe World Solar Commission and his wisdom in guiding\r\nthe preparation of the World Solar Programme 1996-\r\n2005. We also extend our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, the Director-General of\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and others concerned for their\r\nimportant and substantial contributions in the preparation\r\nof the Programme.\r\nEnergy is a fundamental factor in the socio-\r\neconomic development process of nations, and in\r\nparticular in the industrialization process of developing\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\ncountries. The growth in current patterns of energy demand\r\nis expected to continue well into the next decade. About\r\nthree quarters of the world’s energy demand is now being\r\nmet by fossil fuels. Given the current proportion of fossil\r\nfuels consumed and the rapid growth patterns of energy\r\ndemand, there is an urgent need to place in perspective a\r\nworldwide sustainable energy system.\r\nFossil fuels, the traditional primary energy sources,\r\nwill unavoidably be depleted in the long run. It is therefore\r\nimportant that attention be paid to other sources, in\r\nparticular renewable sources which would not only meet\r\nfuture needs but also sustain development for future\r\ngenerations. Solar energy can help meet those needs. This\r\nissue must be seen within the context of the protection and\r\npreservation of the global environment, cost effectiveness,\r\nthe widely available option of conventional sources of\r\nenergy and the more intelligent and efficient use of energy\r\nin order to foster continuing socio-economic growth.\r\nSpreading the sources of energy must also be\r\nconsidered and appreciated as basic to the development\r\nprocess of many countries. Questions relating to the\r\nequitable balance of growth, equal access to amenities,\r\nnational well-being and socio-economic stability depend on\r\na wise and strategic approach to these important issues of\r\nenergy supply. To some marginalized communities, to those\r\nin remote locations and to those not within the range of a\r\nnational grid, the issue of providing other possible sources\r\nof energy becomes not only relevant, but crucial for their\r\nsocio-economic uplift. The broader use of solar energy and\r\nother renewable energy sources, especially in the\r\nelectrification of rural areas and the production of clean\r\ndrinking water, will be an impetus towards the creation of\r\na better quality of life for rural and remote communities in\r\nthe developing countries.\r\nMalaysia believes that in implementing the World\r\nSolar Programme 1996-2005, the international community\r\nmust embark upon a strategic approach based on the\r\nconcerted effort of all nations. There has to be a fair\r\ndistribution of responsibilities between both the developed\r\nand the developing nations. There has to be adequate\r\ntransfer of technology. Those who already possess or have\r\nbenefited from the relevant technologies should consider it\r\ntheir moral and social obligation to participate in and\r\ncontribute to the process of sharing and transferring. The\r\ndeveloped countries, non-governmental organizations, the\r\nprivate sector and intergovernmental bodies which have the\r\nresources, knowledge and experience can provide the\r\nnecessary assistance. Solar energy technologies, for\r\ninstance, need to be transferred to the developing countries\r\nwith minimum cost and hindrance, and with intellectual\r\nrights being part and parcel of the technology transfer.\r\nAdditionally, the critical factor of funding must be given\r\ndue consideration.\r\nMy delegation regards the World Solar Programme\r\n1996-2005 as adding a significant contribution to the\r\nefforts aimed at promoting sustainable development and\r\nthe further implementation of Agenda 21. It is therefore\r\nimportant that all concerned should participate to the\r\nfullest extent possible in the implementation of the\r\nProgramme. My delegation is of the view that the\r\nProgramme should be given due consideration during the\r\ndeliberations on energy at the forthcoming ninth session\r\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development to\r\nadvance the movement towards sustainable patterns of\r\nproduction, distribution and use of energy.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation sincerely hopes that the\r\ndraft resolution will find the consensus of all members of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French): As\r\na member of the World Solar Commission, Senegal fully\r\nsupports the statement made by the representative of\r\nZimbabwe under the item on the World Solar Programme\r\n1996-2005. The great diversity of countries that make up\r\nthe membership of the Commission is a clear reflection\r\nof the consensus on the essential role that this important\r\nsource of energy could play in improving the quality of\r\nlife of peoples. This consensus has been reinforced by the\r\ninclusion of this important item on the agenda of our\r\nAssembly.\r\nFollowing in the wake of the United Nations\r\nconference on solar energy held in Namibia in 1981, the\r\nWorld Solar Summit was held in Harare in 1996, under\r\nthe chairmanship of President Mugabe and with the\r\nparticipation of the Prime Minister of Senegal. The\r\nSummit outlined a coherent set of priorities that are the\r\ncornerstones of the World Solar Programme for the\r\ndecade 1996-2005.\r\nThese objectives are oriented towards the\r\nelectrification of rural areas; education and training in\r\nsolar energy technology; sensitizing decision makers and\r\nthe public at large about the potential of renewable\r\nsources of energy; desalination and water purification; and\r\nthe transfer of ecologically rational technologies.\r\nThe Harare Declaration in support of the Programme\r\nstresses, inter alia, the many advantages of using solar\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\nenergy strictly from the point of view of electrification, as\r\nwell as because of the economic benefits related to poverty\r\nreduction through the promotion of income-generating\r\nactivities, in particular in isolated rural areas.\r\nMoreover, the harnessing of this great source of\r\nenergy is significantly helping preserve the environment by\r\ngreatly reducing harmful effects such as industrial pollution\r\nand deforestation.\r\nIn this way, the objectives and plan of action of the\r\nWorld Solar Programme are well-harmonized with the\r\nefforts of the international community to bring about\r\nsustainable development based on economic and social\r\nprogress and the preservation of the environment. Thus, the\r\nProgramme may be seen as an attempt to give shape to the\r\ncommitments of the Rio Earth Summit, in particular of the\r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\r\nThese are just some of the reasons for Senegal’s\r\nsupport and special interest in the World Solar Programme.\r\nWe are grateful to the United Nations agencies and\r\nother partners for their support of the Programme.\r\nWe hope that the adoption of the draft resolution, of\r\nwhich my country is a sponsor, will be the beginning of a\r\ntrue world partnership in which all of our countries pool\r\ntheir efforts for the triumph of a cause which, after all,\r\nreflects the noble ideals of the Charter: “to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life” for all peoples.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): My delegation associates\r\nitself with the statement made by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Zimbabwe on agenda item 158, entitled\r\n“World Solar Programme 1996-2005” and thanks him for\r\nthe introduction of the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/53/L.8.\r\nAs a member of the World Solar Commission,\r\nJamaica actively participated in the preparatory process\r\nwhich has resulted in the definition of the Programme\r\nbefore us.\r\nI take this opportunity to convey Jamaica’s\r\nappreciation to the Chairman of the Commission,\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, for his effective and inspired leadership of our\r\nwork since the World Solar Summit in 1996. May I also\r\nexpress Jamaica’s appreciation to the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for its\r\nsignificant contribution to the development of the\r\nProgramme.\r\nThe World Solar Programme offers a dynamic\r\nframework for the promotion of widespread use of solar\r\nand other renewable energy sources on a global scale. It\r\nrepresents a concrete follow-up to the recommendations\r\nof the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development regarding the use of energy sources for\r\nsustainable development. The Programme was also\r\nformally adopted within the framework of the Programme\r\nfor the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 at the\r\nnineteenth special session of the General Assembly, in\r\nJune 1997.\r\nJamaica has increasingly incorporated within its\r\nsustainable development strategy a sustainable energy\r\npolicy, acknowledging the integral role which energy\r\nmust play in promoting economic development.\r\nWe are committed to ensuring access by our entire\r\npopulation to viable sources of energy. Diversification of\r\nJamaica’s energy base remains a central goal of our\r\nenergy policy and part of the wider strategy for\r\nsustainable energy use. Within this wider strategy, special\r\nattention has been given to the development of solar\r\nenergy, with a view to assessing its viability as a valid\r\nalternative source of energy for the medium and long\r\nterm.\r\nThe programme for the development of solar energy\r\nuse in Jamaica includes the expanded use of solar water\r\nheaters for both domestic and industrial use, with a view\r\nto eventual reduction of dependence on expensive fossil\r\nfuels. It also includes the use of solar technology in\r\nindustry, such as in the solar crop-drying process used in\r\nthe processing of vegetables, timber and fruit. Such\r\nprojects expand industry and employment opportunities in\r\nrural, agricultural areas. It includes as well the\r\nintroduction of solar lighting or photovoltaic systems for\r\nrural electrification programmes. This is a particularly\r\nimportant effort which will facilitate the electrification of\r\nremote villages where servicing with traditional electric\r\npower lines has proved difficult.\r\nJamaica fully endorses the commitments and bases\r\nfor action articulated in the World Solar Programme, as\r\ndetailed in document A/53/395. We endorse in particular\r\nthe effort to accord priority attention to attracting private\r\ncapital investment in the development of solar and other\r\nalternative energy systems. We are committed to the\r\neffort to accelerate rural development through the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\nharnessing of renewable energy sources and strongly\r\nsupport the call for investment in research and development\r\nin renewable energy sources and for training in the\r\napplication and maintenance of these technologies, with\r\nemphasis on community involvement.\r\nWe wish to underscore the need for technical\r\nassistance and financing for renewable energy initiatives.\r\nWe therefore call on the international community to support\r\nin particular the global, regional and national renewable\r\nenergy projects listed in the World Solar Programme. These\r\nprojects have been identified by Governments as deserving\r\nthe highest priority for implementation.\r\nJamaica offers its unreserved support to the World\r\nSolar Programme and, accordingly, has joined in sponsoring\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.8 and commends it to the General\r\nAssembly for adoption by consensus.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): In spite of the calamity,\r\nhuman and economic, that befell my country in 1974, the\r\npeople of Cyprus, through their indomitable spirit of\r\nsurvival and their hard work, have managed to lift the\r\nstandard of living of our people to admirable levels. One of\r\nthe sources of sustainable development used by our\r\nGovernment and our people was and is the utilization of the\r\nsunlight that blesses our island 360 days a year. Cyprus is\r\nnot endowed with indigenous sources of fossil fuels. With\r\nthe notable exception of solar energy, the utilization of\r\nwhich accounts for 4 per cent of Cyprus’s primary energy\r\nconsumption, the rest of the energy required to meet its\r\nenergy needs is imported. Consequently, the country is\r\ntotally dependent on imported energy, primarily crude oil\r\nand refined products.\r\nDeployment of renewable energy sources is one of the\r\npriorities of Cyprus’s energy policy, which has the goal of\r\nlimiting energy importation. In fact, alternative forms of\r\nenergy are being used on a practical basis by Cypriots for\r\ntheir daily needs. Windmills have been used extensively in\r\nthe past for pumping water from wells, mostly for irrigation\r\npurposes. Solar water heaters are being used for meeting\r\ndomestic hot water needs. The awareness of Cypriots of the\r\nuse of renewable energy sources is reflected in the fact that\r\nCyprus is a leading country — indeed, the leading country\r\nin the world — in installed solar collectors.\r\nSolar heaters have been used in Cyprus since 1960.\r\nAmbitious manufacturers have managed to adapt the\r\ntechnology of solar heaters to local conditions. Today, more\r\nthan 90 per cent of dwellings in Cyprus are equipped with\r\nsolar heaters. A laboratory was established by the\r\nGovernment in 1980 to provide technical assistance to the\r\nmanufacturers of solar heaters. After the 1980s, when the\r\nsecond generation of solar collectors penetrated the\r\nCypriot market, hotels began to use solar energy for\r\nheating water and swimming pools. Currently, more than\r\n50 per cent of hotels are equipped with solar collection\r\nsystems.\r\nSolar energy is used in Cyprus in other, non-thermal,\r\napplications, for instance powering telecommunication\r\nreceivers and transmitters in remote areas where the\r\nelectricity grid does not reach. Furthermore, the Cypriot\r\nTelecommunication Authority has installed solar cells in\r\ntelephone kiosks which are not easily accessible by the\r\nelectricity grid. Further, solar energy utilization in Cyprus\r\nis being pursued both by the private sector and by the\r\nGovernment authorities. Towards that end, research and\r\nadaptation work is being carried out in fields such as\r\nsolar cooling and heating, solar desalination and further\r\ndeployment of photovoltaic systems. It is estimated that\r\nthe contribution of solar energy to the national energy\r\nbalance will double in the next 10 years.\r\nWithin the context of the policy for the further\r\nexploitation of renewable energy sources, the Electricity\r\nAuthority of Cyprus has taken the decision to purchase\r\nelectricity produced from alternative sources and fuels at\r\na higher price than it would cost the Authority to produce\r\nit. This measure is considered to be a milestone for\r\nsustainable development and for the promotion of solar\r\nenergy for the production of electricity.\r\nMy Government is willing to share our experience\r\nand expertise on this issue with other interested\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nCyprus expresses its deep appreciation to Zimbabwe\r\nfor its important initiative and for hosting the World Solar\r\nSummit. We lend our full support to the World Solar\r\nProgramme 1996-2005 and are pleased to be among the\r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/53/L.8, which, we hope,\r\nwill be adopted without a vote.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. I should like to inform\r\nmembers that the General Assembly will take action on\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.8 tomorrow morning in order to\r\nallow consultations to be concluded.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\nAgenda item 159\r\nObserver status for the Association of Caribbean States\r\nin the General Assembly\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.3)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Guatemala to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.3.\r\nMr. Estévez López (Guatemala) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is my honour on behalf of its 32 sponsors to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/53/L.3, entitled “Observer\r\nstatus for the Association of Caribbean States in the\r\nGeneral Assembly”.\r\nMr. Filippi Balestra (San Marino), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe original sponsors of this draft resolution are the\r\n25 member States of the Association — all of which belong\r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States — as\r\nwell as France, an associate member, and the Netherlands,\r\nwhich participates as an observer in the activities of the\r\nAssociation that are of particular interest to it. The\r\nmembers of the Association are extremely grateful to\r\nFrance and to the Netherlands for their sponsorship. They\r\nare also grateful to the most recent sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution, namely, Bangladesh, Canada, India, Italy and the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Three of those\r\nStates — Canada, India and Italy — have observer status\r\nin the Association.\r\nIn decision 49/426 of December 1994, the General\r\nAssembly recognized the appropriateness of granting\r\nobserver status in the Assembly to,\r\n“those intergovernmental organizations whose\r\nactivities cover matters of interest to the Assembly”.\r\nThe explanatory memorandum that is annexed to\r\ndocument A/53/143, which was presented to the Assembly\r\nlast July, outlined the reasons why the activities of the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States, an intergovernmental\r\norganization, fully meet this criterion. That memorandum\r\nalso indicated that the adoption of the draft resolution\r\nincluded in document A/53/143 as annex II, which I am\r\nhonoured to introduce today, would be beneficial to the\r\nAssociation and therefore to the Assembly, which promotes\r\ngoals that coincide largely with those of the Association.\r\nIn fact, the Convention Establishing the Association\r\nof Caribbean States, which entered into force on 4 August\r\n1995, states in article III, paragraph 1:\r\n“The Association is an organisation for consultation,\r\ncooperation and concerted action, whose purpose is\r\nto identify and promote the implementation of\r\npolicies and programmes designed to:\r\n(a) harness, utilise and develop the collective\r\ncapabilities of the Caribbean Region to achieve\r\nsustained cultural, economic, social, scientific and\r\ntechnological advancement;\r\n(b) develop the potential of the Caribbean Sea\r\nthrough interaction among Member States and with\r\nthird parties;\r\n(c) promote an enhanced economic space for trade\r\nand investment with opportunities for cooperation\r\nand concerted action, in order to increase the\r\nbenefits which accrue to the peoples of the\r\nCaribbean from their resources and assets, including\r\nthe Caribbean Sea;\r\n(d) establish, consolidate and augment, as\r\nappropriate, institutional structures and cooperative\r\narrangements responsive to the various cultural\r\nidentities, developmental needs and normative\r\nsystems within the region.”\r\nFor all these reasons, it seems to us that it would be\r\nexcessive and unnecessary for us to try the patience of the\r\nAssembly by dwelling further on the appropriateness of\r\nthe Assembly’s adopting the draft resolution before us. I\r\nwill add, however, that the draft resolution is self-\r\nexplanatory and that its operative part is identical to those\r\nof earlier resolutions through which the General Assembly\r\ngranted observer status to other intergovernmental\r\norganizations.\r\nI will therefore conclude by expressing the hope that\r\nthe draft resolution will be adopted without a vote. I\r\nwould also like to express the appreciation of its sponsors\r\nto all the members that support it.\r\nMr. Singh (India): I deem it an honour to speak on\r\nthe agenda item concerning the granting of observer status\r\nto the Association of Caribbean States in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\nRelations between India and the countries of the\r\nCaribbean region go well back into history. Strengthened by\r\na shared historical and cultural experience, these relations\r\nare poised for a new level of development, reflecting the\r\ncommon aspirations of our countries and peoples.\r\nI had the privilege of visiting some countries of the\r\nregion in 1991 as Minister of State for External Affairs.\r\nThe warmth of the people and the extensive potentialities\r\nfor intensified cooperation between India and the Caribbean\r\ncountries that I observed during that visit left an indelible\r\nimpression on me. My presence here today in many ways\r\nreflects this personal attachment.\r\nIndia enjoys extensive and wide-ranging bilateral\r\ncooperation with all countries of the Association of\r\nCaribbean States. We have therefore maintained close links\r\nwith it since its establishment on 4 August 1995. As an\r\nobserver, we have regularly participated in its meetings and\r\nare in the process of formalizing an agreement for\r\ncooperation with its member countries through the\r\nAssociation, in addition to bilateral cooperation agreements.\r\nWe look forward, through that agreement, to an opportunity\r\nto share and to assist, but also to learn.\r\nWe have been distressed by the havoc wrought by\r\nhurricane Georges on some of the countries of the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States. We have provided some\r\nimmediate assistance and will endeavour to do more\r\nthrough the provision of pharmaceuticals and medical\r\nsupplies. We trust that with the support of the international\r\ncommunity, those countries that have borne the brunt of\r\nhurricane Georges will soon recover.\r\nThe aims of the Association of Caribbean States,\r\nwhich seeks to utilize the potential of the region for the\r\neconomic and social development of all its constituents, are\r\nexemplary. India, along with other countries of our region,\r\nhas been engaged in a similar venture in the context of the\r\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. We\r\nview the regional organizations as the building blocks of a\r\nnew compact of South-South cooperation for the economic\r\nprosperity and social welfare of all.\r\nWe are convinced that greater cooperation between the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States and the United Nations\r\nwould be beneficial to all Member States, enabling us to\r\nshare each other’s experience and enlarge our mutually\r\nbeneficial cooperation. We are conscious of the enormous\r\ncapacities available in the Caribbean countries. The granting\r\nof observer status to the Association would no doubt lead\r\nto a rewarding relationship. We therefore commend the\r\ndraft resolution submitted by Guatemala for adoption by\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): Italy is very glad to co-sponsor\r\nthe draft resolution aimed at granting observer status in\r\nthe General Assembly to the Association of Caribbean\r\nStates. Through this draft resolution the international\r\ncommunity will show once again its awareness of the\r\ncharacteristics and special needs of the Caribbean States;\r\nit will express its appreciation for their extremely valuable\r\nrole; and it will help foster an even closer relationship\r\nbetween them and the United Nations.\r\nMy country is proud of the excellent relations it\r\nenjoys with all of the Caribbean countries. In concrete\r\nterms, we are engaged in numerous initiatives of\r\neconomic, technical and financial cooperation, both\r\nbilateral and multilateral. The closeness between Italy and\r\nthe Caribbean States stems from the geographic,\r\nenvironmental and historical characteristics that we share.\r\nThe Italian people, who live in a land with almost 5,000\r\nkilometres of coastline and countless islands and\r\narchipelagos, are no strangers to the problems and\r\ndifficulties faced by small island and coastal States,\r\nincluding, of course, natural disasters.\r\nHaving common problems also means that we have\r\nmany ideas and experiences and a great deal of know-\r\nhow and expertise to share in helping each other. This is\r\none of the main reasons why Italy has actively promoted\r\ncooperation and partnership with the Alliance of Small\r\nIsland States since its very inception. I wish to underline\r\nthat we have contributed with deeds, and not simply with\r\nwords, to the follow-up of the Global Conference on the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates, in line with the historic Barbados Declaration of\r\n1994. The international community as a whole should\r\nshare and take stock of the invaluable experience that the\r\nsmall island States have accrued in many sectors.\r\nThis year my country, Italy, became the fifth largest\r\ncontributor to the United Nations regular budget,\r\nreflecting its new position as the fifth largest producer of\r\nwealth in the world. Many Italian companies are involved\r\nin the building or management of high-quality tourist\r\nstructures, cruise ship services and air transportation in\r\nthe Caribbean. Last but not least, more and more Italian\r\ntourists are attracted by the extraordinary, exotic beauty\r\nof these lands and by the unique kindness and warm\r\nhospitality of their peoples.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\nItaly, which has long-standing ties of friendship and\r\nculture with the Caribbean States, will continue to follow\r\nthis area with great attention and will continue to be as —\r\nif not more — supportive of its needs in the future as it has\r\nbeen in the past.\r\nHere at the United Nations in particular, our friendship\r\nhas also developed through common battles — battles we\r\nhave fought together for democracy and against privilege,\r\nfor transparency and against closed doors, for participation\r\nand against exclusion.\r\nIn conclusion, Italy welcomes the developments of the\r\npast three years, which have strengthened cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Association of\r\nCaribbean States. This is a particularly successful example\r\nof collaboration with a regional organization and an\r\nexemplary partnership which now fully deserves proper\r\nrecognition and appreciation by the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Caribbean is a cultural, political and\r\neconomic entity of which my country is a part for reasons\r\nboth constitutional and historical. These reasons orient\r\nColombia’s foreign policy towards the goal of integration\r\nand give it a fundamental interest in the development of\r\nrelations with the countries of the Caribbean basin.\r\nColombia believes in the strengthening of the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States as a body for economic\r\nintegration and political coordination that ensures the\r\nbalanced social and cultural development of our peoples. In\r\nthis respect, the Association of Caribbean States has proved\r\nto be one of the best instruments for promoting the\r\nimplementation of policies geared towards developing the\r\ncollective capabilities of the Caribbean to achieve sustained\r\nsocial, cultural, economic, scientific and technological\r\nprogress in the region.\r\nColombia has maintained a proactive and consistent\r\npolicy in all of the Association’s Committees, in particular\r\nin the Committee on Budget and Administration and also in\r\nthe Committee on Trade Development and External\r\nRelations, which it chairs.\r\nMy country is the depositary State for ratifications of\r\nthe agreement establishing the Association, which was\r\nsigned in Cartagena de Indias in July 1994. Colombia also\r\nhad the privilege of hosting the third meeting of the\r\nAssociation’s Ministerial Council, held in November 1997,\r\nalso in Cartagena, whose outcome included the approval of\r\na plan for a tourism zone in the Caribbean, which we\r\nwelcome and which will be taken up at the next\r\nministerial meeting.\r\nWe have been involved with the Association since\r\nthe process of defining its scope began, and we have\r\nmade every effort to promote its institutional\r\ndevelopment. That is why we support the participation,\r\nwith observer status, of the Association of Caribbean\r\nStates in the framework of the United Nations.\r\nWe are convinced that in addition to strengthening\r\ndialogue among our States, the Association itself will gain\r\nnew vigour as a mechanism for political cooperation.\r\nSuch a mechanism is vitally needed to represent the\r\ncommon interests of our region at the international level\r\nand to work more closely with the United Nations system\r\ntowards the shared goal of developing programmes to\r\nimprove the standard of living of the countries of the\r\nregion.\r\nMy country is pleased to support, and is co-\r\nsponsoring, the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/53/L.3 on the granting of observer status to the\r\nAssociation of Caribbean States in the General Assembly,\r\nwhich was introduced today by the delegation of\r\nGuatemala.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): Created in August 1995,\r\nthe Association of Caribbean States (ACS) is, by\r\ncomparison with other regional institutions, a relatively\r\nnew forum. Despite its brief existence, however, it has\r\nalready demonstrated its great potential for promoting\r\nconsultation, cooperation and concerted action among its\r\nmembership to develop the countries and peoples that it\r\nrepresents.\r\nThe Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action\r\nwhich were agreed upon at the Association’s first summit\r\nmeeting held three years ago in Port of Spain, Trinidad\r\nand Tobago, identified three main sectors of cooperation,\r\nnamely, trade, tourism and transport. In so doing, our\r\nleaders hoped to explore more fully the abundant\r\nresources of the Caribbean Sea, a sea that separates us\r\ngeographically but at the same time joins us together\r\nthrough a common history, culture and interests.\r\nOver the years we in the Caribbean have learned to\r\nappreciate the benefits of working together to maximize\r\nour strength and to fulfil our shared aspirations. As part\r\nof a widening network of agencies, the ACS has created\r\nexpanded opportunities for our States to engage in\r\nfunctional cooperation. In addition to the three T’s —\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\ntrade, tourism and transport — the Association also serves\r\nto intensify our efforts in such vital fields as education,\r\nhealth, the environment and natural-disaster preparedness.\r\nTo achieve its full potential, however, the Association\r\nof Caribbean States must be drawn into cooperation with\r\nthe wider United Nations system. As provided for in\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter, the symbiotic relationship\r\nbetween the world Organization and regional arrangements\r\ncan boost the efficiency and effectiveness of international\r\nprogrammes. The record has shown that, with proper\r\ncoordination, partnerships among complementary\r\norganizations can be of considerable advantage for all\r\nparticipants and all States.\r\nPersuaded of this mutual benefit, the Caribbean\r\nCommunity States, which constitute 14 of the 25 members\r\nof the ACS, wish to fully support the Association’s request\r\nfor observer status in this Assembly. On their behalf,\r\ntherefore, I would like to join others who have spoken this\r\nmorning to urge the unanimous adoption of draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.3 as a first step towards the proposed partnership.\r\nMr. Dausá Céspedes (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to address the Assembly\r\nin support of the draft resolution on granting observer status\r\nfor the Association of Caribbean States in the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are addressing this issue because of the links of\r\nfriendship and solidarity that have historically tied the\r\npeople of Cuba to the peoples of the Association of\r\nCaribbean States. The establishment of the Association of\r\nCaribbean States was not only a historic event for its\r\nmember States but also a milestone for all of us who, with\r\nlegitimate pride, predicted that this would be a great\r\nsuccess in the process of regional integration to which we\r\nare all committed. Important international conferences on\r\ncooperation for development, sustainable development and\r\ntrade and development have enjoyed the invaluable\r\nparticipation and support of the member countries of the\r\nAssociation.\r\nCuba feels honoured to participate in this debate. We\r\nare convinced that the Association of Caribbean States can\r\nand must contribute to the multilateral debate and to the\r\nprogress of the United Nations. My country has an active\r\npresence and a high degree of interest in all the processes\r\nand negotiations taking place within the framework of the\r\nAssociation. Cuba has been honoured to organize a number\r\nof meetings of the Association of Caribbean States.\r\nFor many reasons, as sacred and long-lived as our\r\nshared roots, Cuba supports this draft resolution. We are\r\nconvinced — because we have seen proof — that the\r\nspirit that unites the Association of Caribbean States will\r\nundoubtedly contribute to our shared progress in the quest\r\nfor future peace, justice and well-being for all the peoples\r\nof the world.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.3\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.3 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/5).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 159?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 162\r\nObserver status for the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development in the General\r\nAssembly\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.4)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Poland to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.4.\r\nMr. Kozlowski (Poland): I am honoured to address\r\nthe General Assembly today on behalf of all 29 members\r\nof the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD). I would also like to inform the\r\nAssembly that I have just learned that the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia has joined the sponsors\r\nof this draft resolution.\r\nIt is also my great personal honour and privilege\r\nhere to represent Poland, one of the newest members of\r\nthe OECD.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\nThe OECD is an international intergovernmental\r\norganization established by a 1960 Convention and based\r\nin Paris. It comprises countries that share the values of an\r\nopen-market economy, democracy and respect for human\r\nrights. Although it is not a universal body, it has developed\r\na global scope and outlook. It is essentially a forum for\r\npolicy debate, sharing experiences, discussing problems,\r\ndesigning appropriate solutions and appraising outcomes for\r\nthe short and medium term. The OECD’s standards of\r\nexcellence are well-reflected in the statistical, economic and\r\nsocial data and publications it steadily makes available to\r\nall interested parties.\r\nThe OECD has three principal aims which are spelt\r\nout unambiguously in its Convention. The first aim is to\r\nachieve the highest sustainable economic growth and\r\nemployment and a rising standard of living in member\r\ncountries, while maintaining financial stability, and thus to\r\ncontribute to the development of the world economy. The\r\nsecond aim is to contribute to sound economic expansion in\r\nmember as well as non-member countries in the process of\r\neconomic development. Thirdly, the OECD seeks to\r\ncontribute to the expansion of world trade on a multilateral,\r\nnon-discriminatory basis in accordance with international\r\nobligations.\r\nThese aims are to the fullest extent compatible with\r\nthe principal goals of the United Nations. They clearly\r\nconfirm that both the United Nations and the OECD have\r\na common agenda and may benefit from establishing a\r\ncloser relationship.\r\nThe OECD covers most areas of government activity.\r\nThe issues it deals with include economics, finance,\r\nstatistics, fiscal and enterprise affairs, trade, energy,\r\ntransport, environment, development cooperation, education,\r\nemployment, labour and social affairs, science, technology\r\nand industry, food, agriculture and fisheries, public\r\nmanagement and territorial development. The OECD carries\r\nout its work through some 200 specialized bodies assisted\r\nby an international secretariat of about 1,900 staff.\r\nIn addition, the OECD system encompasses a number\r\nof semi-autonomous bodies, including the Nuclear Energy\r\nAgency, the International Energy Agency, the European\r\nConference of Ministers of Transport, the Development\r\nCentre, the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation,\r\nand the Club du Sahel.\r\nThe OECD is an innovative organization, constantly\r\nadapting to emerging needs and requirements. Addressing\r\nissues across disciplines and countries, the OECD is now\r\nfocusing its attention on such central themes as balancing\r\nmacroeconomic and structural policies, ageing\r\npopulations, sustainable development, combating bribery\r\nand corruption, corporate governance, electronic\r\ncommerce, employment, education and training, taxation,\r\ntrade and quality regulations. All these themes are\r\nrelevant to economic growth and prosperity for the future.\r\nLike its programme of work, the membership of the\r\nOECD has been continuously evolving over the years,\r\nthereby responding to new challenges and reflecting\r\nchanges in international relations. Since 1994, Mexico, the\r\nCzech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Republic of\r\nKorea have joined the organization, opening it up to the\r\nperceptions, influences and interests of new members.\r\nOver the years, the OECD has also developed\r\nstronger ties with non-members, especially with those\r\nrepresenting the so-called emerging and transition markets\r\nin different regions. This has been carried out through a\r\nrange of thematic and country activities. Thanks to\r\nOECD’s outreach programme, a number of non-member\r\ncountries participate as observers in the work of specific\r\nOECD bodies. The OECD Development Centre and\r\nDevelopment Assistance Committee provide possibilities\r\nfor policy dialogue and analysis of development issues, in\r\ncooperation with a number of interested developing\r\ncountries. The recent meeting of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan with the OECD Development Assistance\r\nCommittee, which was devoted to the problems of Africa,\r\nclearly demonstrated OECD’s commitment to the cause of\r\npeace and prosperity in that continent, as well as its\r\nsupport for the Secretary-General’s recommendations\r\ncontained in his landmark report on Africa.\r\nThe representatives of United Nations agencies and\r\nbodies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of\r\nthe United Nations, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Environment Programme,\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), the Economic Commission for\r\nEurope and the International Atomic Energy Agency, are\r\nengaged as observers and participants in different\r\nmeetings of the OECD. Likewise, the OECD enjoys\r\nobserver status in the Economic and Social Council and\r\nUNCTAD. It also takes part in United Nations\r\nconferences and conventions on an ad hoc basis.\r\nIt is precisely this ad hoc arrangement that no longer\r\nseems sufficient, judging by the level of expectations and\r\npotential for cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nHence, there is a need for consolidation of the links\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 38th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 15 October 1998\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OECD. A more\r\nworkable, practical and mutually beneficial arrangement\r\nwould consist in granting the OECD the status of observer\r\nin the General Assembly. This is in essence the rationale\r\nfor the submission of this draft resolution for adoption by\r\nthe Assembly. With this in mind, on behalf of the countries\r\nmembers of the OECD and the latest sponsor, I recommend\r\nthe adoption of draft resolution A/53/L.4, on observer status\r\nfor the OECD in the General Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.4.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.4 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/6).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 162?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nMr. Mangoaela in the Chair.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to announce a\r\nchange in the programme of work concerning agenda item\r\n23, “Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community”, as contained in document\r\nA/INF/53/3/Add.1. Instead of being taken up on\r\nThursday, 22 October, item 23 will be considered on\r\nThursday, 29 October.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.45 a.m.\r\n13\r\n"
