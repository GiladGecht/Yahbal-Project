(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mangoaela\r\n(Lesotho), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 158 (continued)\r\nWorld Solar Programme 1996-2005\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.8)\r\nThe Acting President: I have been informed that\r\nthere are additional sponsors of draft resolution A/53/L.8:\r\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Austria, Bangladesh,\r\nBotswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Costa\r\nRica, Croatia, Greece, Lesotho, Malta, the Marshall Islands,\r\nMyanmar, the Netherlands, Spain, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia and Turkmenistan.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.8.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.8 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/7).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration\r\nof agenda item 158?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nIf there are any delegations that still wish to sponsor\r\nthe resolution that has just been adopted, they may sign\r\nup with the Secretariat.\r\nAgenda item 166\r\nElection of judges of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991\r\nLetter from the President of the Security Council\r\n(A/52/1023)\r\nMemorandum by the Secretary-General\r\n(A/53/351)\r\nCurricula vitae (A/53/352)\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly will\r\nnow proceed to the election of three judges to an\r\nadditional Trial Chamber of the International Tribunal for\r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law Committed\r\nin the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991.\r\nBy its resolution 1166 (1998) of 13 May 1998, the\r\nSecurity Council decided to establish a third Trial\r\nChamber of the International Tribunal. It also decided that\r\nthree additional judges should be elected as soon as\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 16 October 1998\r\npossible to serve in the additional Trial Chamber and that\r\nthe judges so elected should serve until the date of expiry\r\nof the terms of office of the judges currently serving on the\r\nTribunal, that is, until 16 November 2001.\r\nIn connection with the election, I should like to bring\r\nthe following matters to the attention of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nFirst, in accordance with article 13, paragraph 2, of the\r\nStatute of the International Tribunal, the three judges of the\r\nthird Trial Chamber of the International Tribunal shall be\r\nelected by the General Assembly from a list of candidates\r\nsubmitted by the Security Council.\r\nAt its 3919th meeting, on 27 August 1998, the\r\nSecurity Council, in accordance with article 13,\r\nsubparagraph 2 (c) of the Statute of the International\r\nTribunal, established in resolution 1191 (1998) a list of nine\r\ncandidates, taking due account of the adequate\r\nrepresentation of the principal legal systems of the world.\r\nThe list was formally conveyed to the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly by a letter dated 27 August 1998 from\r\nthe President of the Security Council. The letter was issued\r\nas document A/52/1023.\r\nSecondly, in accordance with article 13, subparagraph\r\n2 (d), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, the Holy\r\nSee and Switzerland, being non-member States, shall\r\nparticipate in the election in the same manner as the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations. On this occasion, I am\r\nhappy to welcome here the representatives of the Holy See\r\nand Switzerland.\r\nFinally, I should like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the documents relating to the election. The\r\nmemorandum by the Secretary-General concerning the\r\nelection of judges of the International Tribunal is contained\r\nin document A/53/351.\r\nThe list of candidates is to be found in paragraph 6 of\r\ndocument A/53/351.\r\nThe curricula vitae of the candidates are to be found\r\nin document A/53/352. In that connection, may I bring to\r\nthe Assembly’s attention article 13, paragraph 1, of the\r\nStatute of the International Tribunal, which reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n“The judges shall be persons of high moral\r\ncharacter, impartiality and integrity who possess the\r\nqualifications required in their respective countries for\r\nappointment to the highest judicial offices. In the\r\noverall composition of the Chambers due account\r\nshall be taken of the experience of the judges in\r\ncriminal law, international law, including\r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights\r\nlaw.”\r\nAs representatives know, the election of judges will\r\ntake place in accordance with the relevant provisions of\r\narticle 13 of the Statute of the International Tribunal.\r\nIn addition, given the similar nature of the election\r\nof judge of the International Court of Justice and the\r\nelection of judges of the International Tribunal, it was\r\ndecided at the time of the previous elections of judges, in\r\n1993 and 1997, to follow similar election procedures in\r\nthe General Assembly. In his memorandum, the\r\nSecretary-General suggests that this precedent be applied\r\nto the election of judges of the third Trial Chamber of the\r\nInternational Tribunal.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly agrees to that\r\nsuggestion?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with article\r\n13, subparagraph 2 (d), of the Statute of the International\r\nTribunal, the candidates who receive an absolute majority\r\nof the votes of States Members of the United Nations and\r\nof the non-member States maintaining permanent observer\r\nmissions at United Nations Headquarters shall be declared\r\nelected.\r\nThe consistent practice of the United Nations has\r\nbeen to interpret the words “absolute majority” as\r\nmeaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they\r\nvote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose,\r\nare all 185 Member States and the two non-member\r\nStates, namely the Holy See and Switzerland.\r\nAccordingly, 94 votes constitute an absolute majority\r\nfor the purpose of electing judges of the International\r\nTribunal.\r\nIf in the first ballot the number of candidates\r\nobtaining an absolute majority is less than three, a second\r\nballot will be held, and balloting will continue in the\r\nsame meeting, if and as necessary, until three candidates\r\nhave obtained an absolute majority. In any second or\r\nsubsequent ballot, each elector may vote for no more than\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 16 October 1998\r\nthree candidates less the number of candidates who have\r\nalready obtained absolute majorities.\r\nFollowing the practice in the election of judges of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, the Secretary-General\r\nsuggests in his memorandum that subsequent balloting\r\nshould be unrestricted — I repeat, that subsequent balloting\r\nshould be unrestricted. Votes may accordingly be cast in\r\nany second or subsequent ballot for an eligible candidate\r\nwho has not yet obtained an absolute majority.\r\nIt is further suggested that if in the first ballot more\r\nthan the required number of candidates obtain an absolute\r\nmajority of votes, a second ballot will be held on all\r\ncandidates, and balloting will continue at the same meeting\r\nuntil the required number of candidates, and no more,\r\nobtain an absolute majority.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly agrees to the\r\nprocedures I have just outlined?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nOnce again, the delegation of Mexico will not participate in\r\nthe election of judges of the International Tribunal for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. Mexico has consistently held that, in\r\nestablishing that Tribunal, the Security Council acted\r\nbeyond its sphere of competence, since the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations contains no explicit provision giving the\r\nCouncil the authority to create jurisdictional organs of this\r\nnature.\r\nMexico remains convinced that, once it is operational,\r\nthe International Criminal Court, which was indeed\r\nestablished in conformity with the norms of international\r\nlaw, will render the creation of new special tribunals\r\nunnecessary.\r\nThis position notwithstanding, Mexico will continue to\r\npay in timely fashion its assessed financial contribution to\r\nthe Tribunal, strictly abiding by the decisions that the\r\nGeneral Assembly has adopted on this matter.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nthe Holy See.\r\nMonsignor Panikulam (Holy See): The Holy See has\r\nclosely followed the process leading to the establishment of\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991.\r\nThe Holy See, and especially Pope John Paul II, has\r\nunceasingly worked for the cessation of hostilities, the\r\nreconciliation of the parties and international humanitarian\r\nsolidarity with all the victims, and has without any\r\ndistinction condemned in the strongest terms the\r\nperpetrators of crimes, holding them responsible not only\r\nbefore the tribunal of God but also in the courts of human\r\njustice. From the beginning of the conflict, the Holy See\r\nhas supported, especially within the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the principle\r\nof the personal responsibility of the parties, and it\r\ntherefore welcomes today the establishment of the\r\nInternational Tribunal as an instrument of the international\r\ncommunity to express its condemnation of violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nThe Holy See equally welcomes the provisions of\r\nthe Statute of the International Tribunal, as amended on\r\n13 May 1998, in article 13, subparagraphs 2 (a) and (d),\r\nwhich acknowledge the Holy See’s active participation in\r\nthe establishment of the Tribunal, as a non-member State,\r\nmaintaining a permanent observer mission at the United\r\nNations.\r\nHowever, the Holy See, in consideration of its\r\nspecific nature and of its objectives as a sovereign\r\ninternational entity, and in accordance with recognized\r\npractice in similar cases, has decided to abstain from\r\ncasting its vote on the individual candidates for the office\r\nof judge of the International Tribunal.\r\nThe Holy See expresses its confidence in the choices\r\nthat will be made by the international community and its\r\nsincere best wishes for success to the elected judges in\r\ntheir service to the cause of justice. It is the hope of the\r\nHoly See that the persisting culture of impunity will soon\r\nbe brought to an end and that all responsible for serious\r\ncrimes in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, including\r\nthose in Kosovo, will be brought promptly to justice.\r\nThe Acting President: We shall now proceed with\r\nthe election.\r\nThe voting process has now begun.\r\nRepresentatives are requested to use only the ballot\r\npapers now being distributed. Only those candidates\r\nwhose names appear on the ballot papers are eligible for\r\nelection. Representatives will indicate the three candidates\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 16 October 1998\r\nfor whom they wish to vote by placing crosses to the left\r\nof their names on the ballot papers. Ballot papers on which\r\nmore than three names are marked will be considered\r\ninvalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names\r\nappear on the ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, Ms. Tavora\r\n(Brazil), Ms. Pavlova (Bulgaria), Mr. Mwangi (Kenya)\r\nand Mr. Obeid (Syrian Arab Republic) acted as\r\ntellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.45 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11.40 a.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 174\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 174\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 173\r\nRequired absolute majority: 94\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. David Anthony Hunt (Australia) 88\r\nMr. Peter H. Wilkitzki (Germany) 74\r\nMr. Patrick Lipton Robinson (Jamaica) 70\r\nMr. Mohamed Bennouna (Morocco) 69\r\nMr. Húgo Aníbal Llanos Mansilla (Chile) 62\r\nMr. Per-Johan Viktor Lindholm (Finland) 46\r\nMr. Waldo Bandara Srinihal Wadugodapitiya\r\n(Sri Lanka) 40\r\nMr. Jan Skupinski (Poland) 28\r\nMr. Luis Valencia Rodríguez (Ecuador) 22\r\nThe Acting President: Since no candidate has\r\nobtained an absolute majority, the Assembly will have to\r\nproceed to another unrestricted ballot in order to fill the\r\nthree vacancies.\r\nBallot papers are being distributed. All the candidates\r\nwhose names appear on the ballot papers are eligible.\r\nOnce again, I remind representatives to place a cross\r\nat the left of the names of the three candidates for whom\r\nthey wish to vote. Any ballot paper on which more than\r\nthree names are marked will be considered invalid. Votes\r\nmay be cast only for those whose names appear on the\r\nballot papers.\r\nMr. Izquierdo (Ecuador) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation, in order to facilitate the election,\r\nhas decided to withdraw the candidacy of Ambassador\r\nLuis Valencia Rodríguez.\r\nThe Acting President: The representative of\r\nEcuador has stated that one of the names on the list of\r\ncandidates established by the Security Council should be\r\nremoved. I take it that the representative of Ecuador is\r\ninforming the General Assembly that his national has\r\ndecided to withdraw his name from the list. On that\r\nunderstanding, the name of Mr. Luis Valencia Rodríguez\r\nof Ecuador will be removed from the next ballot.\r\nMr. Wyzner (Poland): With the same understanding\r\nas that of the representative of Ecuador and in the same\r\nspirit, I would like to inform the Assembly that the name\r\nof Mr. Skupinski should be removed from the ballot.\r\nAt the same time I would like to express regret that\r\nagain this time, as a year ago, the region and school of\r\nlaw that Mr. Skupinski would have represented will not\r\nbe represented in the Tribunal. I am afraid this will not\r\nhelp the Tribunal in its work.\r\nThe Acting President: From the representative of\r\nPoland’s statement that one of the names on the list of\r\ncandidates established by the Security Council should be\r\nremoved, I take it that he is informing the General\r\nAssembly that his national has decided to withdraw his\r\nname from the list. On that understanding, the name of\r\nMr. Jan Skupinski will be removed from the next ballot.\r\nIn view of the fact that the ballot papers will need to\r\nbe revised in order to reflect the changes that have just\r\nbeen announced, we shall suspend the meeting for 10\r\nminutes.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.45 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12.05 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly will\r\nnow proceed to another unrestricted ballot to fill the\r\nremaining three vacancies.\r\nBallot papers are now being distributed. All the\r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers are\r\neligible. Once again, I would remind delegates to place a\r\ncross at the left of the names of the three candidates for\r\nwhom they wish to vote. Any ballot paper on which more\r\nthan three names are marked will be considered invalid.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 39th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 16 October 1998\r\nVotes may be cast only for those whose names appear on\r\nthe ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, Ms. Tavora\r\n(Brazil), Ms. Pavlova (Bulgaria), Mr. Mwangi (Kenya)\r\nand Mr. Obeid (Syrian Arab Republic) acted as\r\ntellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 12.15 p.m. and\r\nresumed at 1.20 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 175\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 174\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 173\r\nRequired absolute majority: 94\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. David Anthony Hunt (Australia) 113\r\nMr. Patrick Lipton Robinson (Jamaica) 98\r\nMr. Peter H. Wilkitzki (Germany) 87\r\nMr. Mohamed Bennouna (Morocco) 76\r\nMr. Húgo Aníbal Llanos Mansilla (Chile) 57\r\nMr. Per-Johan Viktor Lindholm (Finland) 30\r\nMr. Waldo Bandara Srinihal Wadugodapitiya\r\n(Sri Lanka) 19\r\nThe Acting President: Having obtained an absolute\r\nmajority, Mr. David Anthony Hunt (Australia) and\r\nMr. Patrick Lipton Robinson (Jamaica) are elected members\r\nof the International Tribunal to serve in the third Trial\r\nChamber.\r\nMs. Rasi (Finland): In order to facilitate the voting\r\nprocess, I wish to request that the name of Judge Lindholm\r\nbe deleted from the list.\r\nThe Acting President: Members have heard the\r\nstatement just made by the representative of Finland. The\r\nname of Mr. Per-Johan Viktor Lindholm will be deleted\r\nfrom the ballot papers.\r\nMr. De Saram (Sri Lanka): In light of the results of\r\nthe voting, I am withdrawing the name of the candidate of\r\nSri Lanka, Mr. Wadugodapitiya.\r\nThe Acting President: The name of Mr. Waldo\r\nBandara Srinihal Wadugodapitiya has been withdrawn and\r\nwill be deleted from the list.\r\nThere remains one seat to be filled. The Assembly\r\nwill now proceed to another ballot to fill the remaining\r\nvacancy. In accordance with the decision taken earlier,\r\nthat ballot shall be unrestricted.\r\nBallot papers are being distributed.
