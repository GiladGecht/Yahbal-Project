(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 11\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/52/2)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call on\r\nthe President of the Security Council, His Excellency Sir\r\nJeremy Greenstock, to introduce the report of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom), President\r\nof the Security Council: It is a privilege for me, Sir, to be\r\ncalled upon to address the General Assembly under your\r\npresidency and to follow in the footsteps of many\r\ndistinguished predecessors from a wide range of Member\r\nStates, including my own, in introducing the annual report\r\nof the Security Council, covering the period from 16 June\r\n1997 to 15 June 1998.\r\nThe members of the Security Council continue to\r\nattach great importance to the timely preparation and\r\nsubmission of this annual report in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter. As in\r\nprevious years, the report was issued to all Member States\r\nin draft and was adopted at a public meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil. The members of the Security Council also took\r\ncare to submit the report to the Assembly in good time\r\nbefore the start of the general debate on 21 September. The\r\nmembers of the Council remain indebted to the Security\r\nCouncil secretariat for their hard work and professionalism\r\nin contributing to this, and for their unstinting efforts on so\r\nmany other matters throughout the course of the year.\r\nAs the annual report for this period makes clear, the\r\nSecurity Council has had another very busy year. This\r\ndoes not in itself demonstrate high productivity, but rather\r\nreflects the many problems related to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security with which the Council\r\nhas had to deal. During the period under review, the\r\nCouncil held over 100 formal meetings, adopted 61\r\nresolutions and agreed upon 41 statements by its\r\nPresident. The subject matter of the questions before the\r\nCouncil remains as wide-ranging as ever. The situation in\r\nAfrica occupied much of the time of the Council, and was\r\nconsidered as a general item in its own right. But the\r\nreport of the Council, which records the consideration of\r\nissues arising also in Asia, Europe, Australasia and\r\nCentral America, shows that peace and security issues are\r\nnot confined to any one geographical region. It is also\r\nnoteworthy that the Council has considered certain aspects\r\nof peace and security from a global perspective, for\r\nexample its consideration of protection for humanitarian\r\nassistance to refugees and others in conflict situations,\r\nand of the role of civilian police and other aspects of\r\npeacekeeping operations. I am sure that today’s debate in\r\nthe Assembly, which is an important event as part of the\r\nprocess of dialogue between the Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council, will deal not just with the history and\r\nthe statistics but also with the substance of some of these\r\nissues.\r\nMay I comment on the format and composition of\r\nthis report, which shows some significant developments\r\nin comparison with its predecessors. The members of the\r\nCouncil have taken careful note of the need to enhance\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nthe transparency of the Council, a concept which applies\r\nnot only to the way in which the Council carries on its\r\nwork, but also to the way in which that work is reported\r\nand recorded. It has long been a concern of many members\r\nof the Organization that the analytical nature of this report\r\nshould be enhanced. In response to those concerns, the\r\nPresident of the Security Council set out new guidelines for\r\nthe content of the report in a note of 12 June 1997\r\n(S/1997/451). That decision is reflected for the first time in\r\nthe report before us today.\r\nMembers will have noted that, in accordance with that\r\ndecision, this year’s report includes, as background, a\r\ndescriptive list of the decisions, resolutions and presidential\r\nstatements of the Council for the year preceding the period\r\nwhich is covered. For the 16 June 1997 to 15 June 1998\r\nperiod covered by the report, the report now includes, for\r\neach item of substance, a description in chronological order\r\nof the consideration by the Council of the subject and of\r\nthe actions taken by the Council on that item, including\r\ndescriptions of the decisions, resolutions and presidential\r\nstatements, and a list of communications received by the\r\nCouncil and of reports from the Secretary-General. It also\r\nincludes information on the dates of formal meetings and\r\ninformal consultations, on which subjects were discussed,\r\non the work of subsidiary organs including the sanctions\r\ncommittees, on the documentation and working methods\r\nand procedures of the Council, and on matters brought to\r\nthe attention of the Council but not discussed by it in the\r\nperiod covered. The appendices now include full texts of all\r\nthe resolutions, decisions and statements adopted or voted\r\nupon by the Council during this period, together with\r\ninformation about meetings with troop-contributing\r\ncountries. All in all, the intention of these changes is to\r\nmake the report more comprehensive and easier to use, and\r\nto set out a more detailed record of the work of the Council\r\nduring the past year.\r\nAnother significant development is the inclusion in\r\nthis report, for the first time, of brief assessments of the\r\nwork of the Council prepared by representatives who had\r\ncompleted their functions as President of the Council. These\r\nassessments were prepared by each President under his own\r\nresponsibility, though they were prepared in consultation\r\nwith the other members of the Council for the month\r\nduring which he presided. They do not represent the views\r\nof the Council as such, and naturally each report reflects in\r\nsome respects the individual perceptions of each President.\r\nBut members of the Council believe this new approach is\r\none which is helpful and informative and which will\r\nprovide a useful insight into the substance of the work of\r\nthe Council during the course of the year.\r\nAlthough this report of the Council is, for these\r\nreasons, rather fuller than those of previous years, I must\r\nrecall that it is not intended as a substitute for the official\r\nrecords of the Security Council, which provide a more\r\nsubstantive account of the Council’s deliberations. The\r\nreport should be read, for the purposes of this discussion\r\nin the General Assembly, in conjunction with other\r\nofficial documents of the Council, to which it constitutes\r\na reference guide.\r\nFinally, Mr. President, I would like to assure you\r\nand all the members of this Assembly that the members\r\nof the Council will listen attentively to the debate which\r\nis being held today. As in previous years, members of the\r\nCouncil value this opportunity for a dialogue, and will\r\ngive careful consideration to the points which are put\r\nforward.\r\nMr. Kastrup (Germany): For the fifty-third time,\r\nthe Security Council is presenting an annual report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. As in previous years, Germany\r\nwelcomes this presentation. The report is the result of\r\nenormous efforts made by the Secretariat staff to give the\r\ngeneral membership more than a rough idea of the work\r\nof the Council and the issues the Council dealt with\r\nbetween June 1997 and June 1998. Let me seize this\r\nopportunity to thank all those involved in this time-\r\nconsuming endeavour.\r\nAt the same time, the report also seems to be a\r\nstrong indication that far more efforts are needed to bring\r\nabout a comprehensive reform of the Organization. Of\r\ncourse, everybody knows that the report of the Council is\r\nonly one element of the badly and urgently needed overall\r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nAllow me to elaborate on these points in more detail\r\nand in the following sequence: first, workload and\r\neffectiveness of the Council; secondly, innovative\r\nelements in this year’s report; and thirdly, the necessity to\r\naim at more comprehensive reform measures.\r\nWith regard to workload and effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil, the report reflects the enormous workload of the\r\nCouncil in the past 12 months. The numbers have been\r\nmentioned by the President of the Council. Among other\r\nthings, the activities of the Security Council considered by\r\nthe report cover wide areas of conflict, mostly in, but not\r\nlimited to Africa. The former Yugoslavia, Georgia and\r\nTajikistan also figured on the agenda, as did Asian\r\ncountries such as Afghanistan and Cambodia. The report\r\nuses more than 300 pages to cover these and other\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nquestions, without counting the 48 additional pages which\r\nreflect the monthly assessments of the respective Presidents\r\nof the Council. Altogether this adds up to over 60 pages\r\nmore than last year’s report. In other words, the report,\r\nwhose drafting apparently absorbs a great deal of time and\r\neffort, has again grown considerably.\r\nI really wonder how many of us might have read\r\nevery single page of the report or at least substantial\r\nselected parts of it. The report undoubtedly has its merits as\r\na reference document. However, the question remains of\r\nwhether it could be done in a more comprehensive, more\r\neffective and less time- and paper-consuming manner.\r\nI would now like to address the innovative elements\r\nin this year’s report. There can hardly be any doubt that the\r\ninnovative elements in this year’s report are the monthly\r\nassessments of the work of the Council, which have been\r\nincluded as an addendum to the report. The assessments\r\nrepresent the reaction of the Council to the requests for a\r\nmore analytical report which Germany and many other\r\ncountries have made repeatedly in the past. The inclusion\r\nof the assessments deserves broad applause. It is a new\r\neffort to add life to a routine exercise and, like many new\r\nefforts, it had a rather slow start. Germany would like to\r\nencourage all future presidencies of the Council to be as\r\nopen, forthcoming and analytical as possible, since there\r\nhardly seems to be any other way for thorough analysis but\r\nthrough individual assessments.\r\nGermany has noted with appreciation the early\r\npresentation of the report, on 9 September 1998.\r\nI would now like to comment on the necessity of\r\naiming at more comprehensive reform measures. The report\r\ninforms the general membership about the work of the\r\nSecurity Council in the past. My delegation would like to\r\nsee improved information and to see participation take place\r\nnot in the aftermath of events but at the time of their\r\noccurrence. In addition to calling for more transparent\r\nworking methods, Germany firmly holds the view that the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council has to be changed. The\r\ncurrent membership no longer corresponds to the realities\r\nof the world. The pivotal and comprehensive Security\r\nCouncil reform proposal of the former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Razali Ismail, continues to be, in\r\nthe view of many delegations, a constructive basis for\r\nfurther discussions.\r\nReform does not consist of papers and documents, as\r\nwell written as they may be. For the first time, there is the\r\nchance for a true and complete overhaul of the Security\r\nCouncil, which in its present composition is no longer\r\ncapable of meeting the expectations of the membership,\r\nlet alone those of the international community and the\r\npublic. The United Nations can count on Germany and\r\nour active commitment during this session to work to\r\nbenefit the entire Organization.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): Before\r\ngiving the floor to the next speaker, I should like to\r\npropose that the list of speakers on this item be closed at\r\n12 noon today. If there are no objections to this approach,\r\nI shall take it that the Assembly agrees with this proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\ntherefore ask representatives who wish to participate in\r\nthe debate on this item to inscribe their names on the list\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I wish to thank the\r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom,\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober 1998, for introducing the report of the Security\r\nCouncil. I would particularly like to thank him for the\r\nsuccinct and focused oral presentation he has just made,\r\nwhich places the report in the right context, thereby\r\nproviding a framework for an in-depth discussion of the\r\nsubject.\r\nMy delegation notes that the current report is the\r\nfirst submitted by the Security Council pursuant to the\r\nmeasures initiated by the Council in June 1997 aimed at\r\nenhancing the analytical nature of the report. My\r\ndelegation finds the report a great improvement over\r\nthose submitted by the Council in the past. Its modified\r\nformat and more rational organization of its content have\r\ncontributed to its overall readability. We particularly\r\ncommend the more organized layout of the report, which\r\nconsists of a set of three sub-headings setting out brief\r\nbut useful background information on the issues dealt\r\nwith by the Council, their actual consideration by the\r\nCouncil and a description of the communications received\r\nby the Council during the period under review. In terms\r\nof its coverage of the decisions of the Council, we find\r\nthe report more descriptive, which therefore makes it an\r\nimportant and much needed analytical tool for Member\r\nStates that are not members of the Council.\r\nOne innovative change in the format of the report\r\nwhich my delegation finds particularly useful is the\r\nassessment of the work of the Council by the President of\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nthe Council for each particular month, prepared under his\r\nown responsibility. While these assessments do not\r\nconstitute the collective views of the Council as a whole\r\nbut are prepared following consultations with members of\r\nthe Council, they give an important overview of the work\r\nof the Security Council during a particular month. Overall,\r\nthese assessments, which are written in a balanced,\r\nobjective and non-controversial manner, contain pertinent\r\nand useful observations and comments by the President of\r\nthe Council during the month in question with respect to\r\nthe work of the Council, particularly in regard to improved\r\nworking methods of the Council and the contribution of\r\neach President in that direction. My delegation would\r\ntherefore encourage the continuation of such monthly\r\npresidential assessments, which we hope could be further\r\nimproved in future.\r\nMy delegation would like to pay tribute to the Council\r\nfor its increasing preparedness to be more open and\r\ntransparent in its work in response to the expressed wish of\r\nMember States that are not members of the Council. This\r\nnew openness is reflected by the increased flow and sharing\r\nof information with non-members of the Council, either\r\nthrough the early availability of draft resolutions to\r\ninterested States Members of the Organization, the regular\r\nor sometimes daily briefings by the President of the\r\nCouncil, or more formal or open debates. Through such\r\nopenness, Member States that are not members of the\r\nCouncil no longer have to depend on newspaper accounts\r\nof the deliberations and decisions of the Council, as was\r\nlargely the case in the past. This has enormously facilitated\r\nthe work of interested permanent missions in their reporting\r\nto their Governments and has contributed to a great extent\r\nto improving the image and credibility of the Council vis-à-\r\nvis the States Members of the United Nations.\r\nWe are particularly grateful to the members of the\r\nCouncil for giving, during the period of their presidency,\r\ndetailed daily briefings to non-members immediately\r\nfollowing the conclusion of informal consultations of the\r\nCouncil. These are especially useful to interested Member\r\nStates that follow the issues closely and that are expected\r\nto take part in the formal debates that sometimes follow\r\nthese informal consultations. We would like to commend\r\nthe high quality of the briefings given by the Presidents of\r\nthe Council, compared to previously, and hence the\r\nnoticeably increased attendance at these briefings. I should\r\nadd that non-Council members find equally useful the\r\nestablished practice of announcing in the Journal of the\r\nUnited Nations the issues scheduled for consideration in the\r\ninformal consultations under the agenda item entitled\r\n“Other matters”.\r\nOn the substantive aspect of the work of the\r\nCouncil, my delegation would like to touch on a few\r\nissues it considers important, namely with respect to\r\nsanctions and peacekeeping. On the question of sanctions,\r\nwhile my delegation recognizes that they are a legitimate\r\ninstrument of enforcement provided for in the Charter and\r\nserve specific purposes, we would like to reiterate the\r\npoint we made in the General Assembly that sanctions\r\nshould be an instrument of last resort, when all other\r\nmeans have failed. They should be imposed only if\r\nabsolutely necessary. They should have clear and specific\r\nobjectives and parameters, and they should be clearly\r\ntargeted, with specified time-frames and appropriate\r\nreview mechanisms based on a fair and objective\r\nevaluation of the effects and effectiveness of the\r\nsanctions.\r\nThis is important in order to ensure the credibility of\r\nthe Council, for while the decision to impose economic,\r\nmilitary, financial or diplomatic sanctions may easily be\r\ntaken through the adoption by the Council of a simple\r\nresolution, their implementation usually raises a large\r\nnumber of problems for the international community,\r\nincluding the neighbouring States. Sanctions can, and\r\nusually do, take a very long time to work. They can cause\r\nenormous collateral negative effects to innocent and\r\nblameless civilians, including women, children, the aged\r\nand the infirm, in the target States as well as others\r\nbefore they achieve their objectives. Unless they are\r\nperceived as being fair and can be effectively carried out\r\nwith the strong and consistent support of the international\r\ncommunity, sanctions may run the risk of being\r\nchallenged, thereby undermining the prestige and\r\ncredibility of the United Nations itself.\r\nIn this regard, therefore, it is important for the\r\nCouncil to take a careful look at the use and practices of\r\nsanctions with a view to ensuring their efficacious and\r\njudicious implementation, in the interest of ensuring their\r\ncontinuing international support. It is particularly\r\nimportant that sanctions not be perceived as punitive\r\ninstruments in the hands of one or two Council members\r\nwhich are intent on punishing a particular country or\r\ncountries that they do not like. A step in the right\r\ndirection in this regard is further to improve the working\r\nmethods and practices of the various sanctions\r\ncommittees, such as through increased transparency of\r\ntheir working procedures, greater access to information by\r\nnon-Council members and increased consultation with the\r\naffected States. My delegation would also encourage the\r\nChairmen of the sanctions committees to put into effect\r\nthe practice of giving oral briefings after each meeting, in\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nthe same manner that the President of the Security Council\r\ndoes following the informal consultations of the Council.\r\nIt is also important for the Council to consider in\r\ngreater depth the “dual-use” principle adopted by the\r\nsanctions committees, particularly when it is applied in the\r\ncontext of requests for humanitarian consideration. This is\r\nbecause almost all goods necessary for human survival have\r\nsome military use. Furthermore, because military and\r\neconomic sanctions are often imposed as a package, it is\r\npolitically difficult for the Council to lift economic\r\nsanctions while maintaining those relating to the military.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping, my delegation is\r\ngratified at the way that peacekeeping operations have\r\nbenefited enormously from the lessons learned from past\r\nexperiences. As a troop- contributing country, Malaysia is\r\nequally pleased with the increased and regular interaction\r\nbetween the Council and troop- contributing countries. This\r\ncontributes in no small measure to increased awareness and\r\nappreciation on the part of the Governments concerned of\r\nthe problems and requirements of peacekeeping. It is also\r\nhelpful in terms of generating continued support by States\r\nMembers of the Organization for such peacekeeping\r\noperations, currently and in future. In this regard, it is\r\nimportant for troop-contributing countries to be reimbursed\r\non a timely basis — hence the importance of all Member\r\nStates’ paying their peacekeeping contributions on time, in\r\nfull and without conditions.\r\nMy delegation notes the increasing reliance by the\r\nUnited Nations on regional partners in managing regional\r\nconflicts, including the undertaking of peacekeeping\r\noperations. While such a division of labour and sharing of\r\nresources may be the appropriate thing to do, especially at\r\na time of severe financial constraints on the part of the\r\nOrganization, it is imperative that in doing so there should\r\nbe established clear lines of authority, responsibility and\r\ncommunication between the United Nations and the\r\nregional organizations concerned. At the same time, it is\r\nimportant to ensure that in all these efforts there is no\r\nabandoning of the central and critical role of the United\r\nNations, particularly the Security Council, in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, as\r\nenshrined in the Charter.\r\nThere is no denying the central and critical role of the\r\nSecurity Council in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. However, in carrying out its work it is\r\nimportant that it have the strong and consistent support of\r\nthe international community in order to ensure the\r\nlegitimacy of its decisions in the eyes of non-members of\r\nthe Council, which sit on the outside and are not privy to\r\nits deliberations. To the extent that this annual report of\r\nthe Security Council contributes to this increased\r\nunderstanding of and support for the work of the Council,\r\nmy delegation warmly commends it. As improving the\r\nworking methods of the Council is an ongoing process,\r\nmy delegation looks forward to better reporting of the\r\nwork of the Council to the General Assembly, including,\r\nwhenever possible, the submission of special reports, as\r\nprovided for in the United Nations Charter.\r\nMr. Powles (New Zealand): I would like to note at\r\nthe outset that on questions involving the working\r\nmethods of the Council, and particularly issues of\r\ntransparency, New Zealand has the privilege of\r\nmaintaining close coordination with the delegation of\r\nArgentina. That delegation has informed me that it is in\r\nsympathy with the statement that follows. I should also\r\nlike at the outset to join the Permanent Representative of\r\nMalaysia in thanking the President of the Security\r\nCouncil for his presentation of the Council’s report this\r\nmorning.\r\nUnder this item the Security Council endeavours to\r\naddress the General Assembly’s right to be informed of\r\nthe measures the Council has decided upon or has taken\r\nin order to maintain international peace and security\r\nduring the period under review. This requirement is spelt\r\nout in Article 15 and Article 24, paragraph 3, of the\r\nCharter. It arises from the essential nature of the\r\nrelationship between the two organs, whereby the Security\r\nCouncil acts on behalf of the wider membership\r\nrepresented in this Assembly.\r\nThe present report of the Security Council in\r\ndocument A/53/2 sets out the many important issues that\r\nwere brought to the Council’s attention and the action\r\ntaken by the Council between 16 June 1997 and 15 June\r\nthis year. If I may begin by indulging in a little\r\nparochialism, a question of special significance to my\r\nown delegation was the Council’s consideration of a\r\nUnited Nations role in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea,\r\nas called for in the peace Agreement signed at Lincoln\r\nUniversity in New Zealand in January of this year. We\r\nremain grateful to those members of the Council that took\r\na particular interest in the matter and contributed to the\r\npositive outcome which has led to the establishment of a\r\nsmall United Nations political office in Bougainville to\r\nmonitor the peace process.\r\nLooking farther afield, the report records how the\r\nCouncil necessarily devoted a good deal of effort over the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\npast year to the situation in Africa, including consideration\r\nof the Secretary-General’s valuable report on “The causes\r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa”. Given the importance\r\nof the topic, a very large number of delegations were\r\nrepresented at the open meeting of the Council on 24 April\r\n1998, and many Member States non-members of the\r\nSecurity Council spoke. The Council subsequently adopted\r\nresolution 1170 (1998) which among other things\r\nestablished an ad hoc Working Group on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report.\r\nI would also like to refer to the Security Council’s\r\ncrucial role, through the adoption of resolution 1172 (1998),\r\nin giving expression to the international community’s\r\ncondemnation of nuclear testing by India and Pakistan in\r\nMay this year. Our satisfaction at this outcome was,\r\nhowever, unfortunately tempered by the relatively low\r\nturnout for the open meeting on Saturday, 6 June, when the\r\nresolution was adopted. This was largely attributable to the\r\nfact that notice of the possibility of this Saturday meeting\r\nwas only provided by fax to Missions long after the close\r\nof business on Friday, 5 June. In my own Mission, the\r\nrelevant fax was recorded as having been received well\r\nafter midnight. I am just not sure how many conscientious\r\nMissions are still at work at that hour on a Friday night.\r\nI would add that many Member States non-members\r\nof the Council that did manage to take part in the 6 June\r\nmeeting were given further cause for concern when the\r\nCouncil proceeded to adopt the relevant resolution before\r\npermitting them to speak.\r\nBut to turn to the report itself, there are a number of\r\ndistinct improvements in this year’s report which we wish\r\nto recognize. We are particularly pleased to see included in\r\ndocument A/53/2 as an addendum the monthly assessments\r\ndone by the former Presidents of the Council. This\r\nrepresents an encouraging step towards greater\r\ntransparency. The assessments of the former Presidents are\r\nan important contribution to our understanding of the\r\nconsiderations that informed the Council’s decision-making.\r\nThey allow us, the wider membership, a glimpse into the\r\nclosed world of the Council’s informal consultations, where\r\nmost Council decisions are in fact made.\r\nWe are also pleased to see that this year’s report\r\nreturns to the practice of telling us how many informal\r\nconsultations of the whole were held on each question\r\nbefore the Council. As my colleague from Argentina\r\ncommented on this very occasion last year, the quantity of\r\ninformal consultations that the Security Council holds is\r\nnot a superfluous or irrelevant fact. Rather, and I quote him,\r\n“it is information that gives non-members an idea of\r\nthe extent to which the work of the Council has\r\nbeen conducted by means of procedures for which\r\nthere is no record whatsoever”. (A/52/PV.39, p. 10)\r\nWe will have more to say specifically on the\r\nworking methods of the Council under agenda item 59,\r\n“Question of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters”. Many delegations in recent years, whether while\r\nserving on the Council or in the context of the Open-\r\nended Working Group dealing with the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, have put forward useful ideas for its\r\nmodernization. Our own cooperation with Argentina has\r\nits seeds in the year 1994, during which we served\r\ntogether on the Security Council. We wish Argentina and\r\nthe four other newly elected members of the Council —\r\nCanada, Malaysia, Namibia and the Netherlands — every\r\nsuccess in the continuing effort to make the Council more\r\ndemocratic and accountable.\r\nSome of the proposals that have been made from\r\ntime to time for improvements have taken root, as this\r\nreport shows. But as is often the case with so many good\r\nideas, practice can fall short of principle. It seems to my\r\ndelegation that the heart of the problem lies in the\r\nimbalance between open meetings of the Council and the\r\nfar more frequent use of informal consultations of the\r\nwhole for taking decisions. Meetings held in private can\r\nobviously be useful at times. But they should not have\r\nbeen permitted to become the normal modus operandi for\r\nany part of this Organization.\r\nAs The New York Times columnist A. M. Rosenthal\r\nreminded us on 6 March this year in a powerful piece of\r\nwriting headed “The Secret Council”, it wasn’t always\r\nthis way. The great majority of meetings were in fact held\r\nin public during the first 20 years after the Organization’s\r\ncreation. Council members could and did meet privately,\r\nbut, as Mr. Rosenthal notes,\r\n“the purpose was to have some quiet conversation,\r\nnot to close the real business to the public”.\r\nOpen meetings stimulated a good deal of public\r\ninterest in the United Nations, something it sorely needs\r\nnow, despite the impressive efforts of our Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the celebrity “rubber-chicken” circuit —\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nefforts which are of course admired and supported by us\r\nall.\r\nAll of us here are indeed fortunate to be living at a\r\ntime when access to information has never been greater. It\r\nis the cornerstone of democracy and one of the truly\r\npositive effects of globalization. When it comes to issues of\r\ninternational peace and security, people around the world\r\nwant to know what their diplomats and Governments are\r\ndoing in their name. It seems to me very worrying,\r\ntherefore, that the Security Council continues to cling to the\r\nhabit of secrecy in so much of its decision-making, when\r\nthe tide is so clearly running the other way.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me first of all to express our gratitude to\r\nthe President of the Security Council for his introduction to\r\nthe report covering the period from 16 June 1997 to 15\r\nJune 1998, contained in document A/53/2.\r\nArticles 10 through 17 of the Charter of the United\r\nNations refer to the functions and powers of the General\r\nAssembly. Pursuant to Article 15, the Assembly shall\r\nreceive and consider both the annual reports and the special\r\nreports issued by the Security Council. Likewise, in Article\r\n24, paragraph 3, the Charter establishes that the Council\r\nshall submit annual and, when necessary, special reports to\r\nthe General Assembly for its consideration.\r\nThese two provisions establish a link of the greatest\r\nimportance for the performance of the United Nations, a\r\nlink that reflects the fact that when the Security Council\r\nacts in conformity with the Charter, it does so on behalf of\r\nthe Member States. At the same time, there is an organ\r\nwithin the Organization, the General Assembly, in which all\r\nMember States are represented, and it is vested with a\r\nbroad mandate covering the various issues and questions\r\nwithin the framework of the Charter.\r\nThe importance of the report of the Council to the\r\nAssembly is further underscored by the fact that in Article\r\n15, paragraph 1, the Charter makes a separate reference to\r\nthe report of the Council, highlighting it and distinguishing\r\nit from all the reports of the various other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations submit to the General Assembly. These are\r\nreferred to in paragraph 2 of that same Article.\r\nWe believe it is appropriate to give a brief account of\r\nthe steps taken by the General Assembly with a view to\r\nstrengthening the link the Charter establishes between the\r\nmain organs of the Organization, in particular between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, through\r\nvarious means, including the system of reports.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/233 of 1993 recalls\r\nthat the Organization is based on the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of States and that the General\r\nAssembly is the only principal organ consisting of all\r\nMembers in which each State an equal opportunity to\r\nparticipate in the decision-making process. In its operative\r\npart, it encourages Member States to participate actively\r\nin a substantive and in-depth discussion on, and\r\nconsideration of, the reports of the Security Council in\r\norder to fulfil the relevant provisions of the Charter.\r\nResolution 48/264 of 1994 invites the President of\r\nthe General Assembly to propose appropriate ways and\r\nmeans to facilitate an in-depth discussion by the\r\nAssembly of matters addressed in the reports of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe process that was begun by the resolutions to\r\nwhich I have referred underwent significant development\r\nwith the adoption of resolution 51/193 on 17 December\r\n1996. That resolution encourages the Council, in the\r\nsubmission of its reports to the General Assembly, to\r\nprovide a timely, substantive, analytical and material\r\naccount of its work. The resolution urges the Security\r\nCouncil to take a set of measures regarding the content of\r\nits reports to the General Assembly: first, to include\r\ninformation on the consultations of the whole undertaken\r\nprior to action or deliberation by the Council on issues\r\nwithin its mandate, and on the process leading to such\r\naction; secondly, to include the decisions,\r\nrecommendations or progress of work of the subsidiary\r\norgans of the Council, in particular the sanctions\r\ncommittees; thirdly, to highlight the extent to which\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, on issues falling\r\nwithin the scope of the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council, have been taken into account by the\r\nCouncil in its decision-making; fourthly, to strengthen\r\nfurther the section in the report on the steps taken by the\r\nCouncil to improve its working methods; and, finally, to\r\ninclude information on requests received under Article 50\r\nof the Charter and actions taken by the Council thereon.\r\nAlmost two years have elapsed since the Assembly\r\nadopted that resolution which, in broad terms, traced the\r\npath for a useful flow of information from the Council to\r\nall the States Members of the Organization represented in\r\nthe General Assembly, thus permitting the Assembly to\r\ncarry out thoroughly the role assigned to it by the\r\nCharter.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nFrom the report before us, we note in particular the\r\nCouncil’s endeavours to improve the content and features\r\nof its annual report. Given its importance for proper\r\nunderstanding of the process that precedes adoption of\r\ndecisions by the Security Council, the inclusion of\r\ninformation on consultations of the whole therefore\r\nconstitutes an important step. It is desirable to continue\r\nbroadening and developing this practice. The same applies\r\nto the inclusion of the decisions and recommendations of\r\nthe subsidiary organs of the Council, in particular the\r\nsanctions committees.\r\nMy delegation wishes to welcome the addition to the\r\nreport of monthly assessments of the Council’s work by the\r\nrespective former Presidents. This is without doubt the most\r\nnoteworthy, innovative and positive event to point out.\r\nEven if such assessments are included as an information\r\ntool and do not represent the opinions of the Council, they\r\nconstitute an important step in the right direction, aimed at\r\nenhancing transparency and enabling the Assembly to carry\r\nout a judicious and objective evaluation of the work\r\naccomplished by the Council during the relevant period.\r\nWe would also like to underscore the Council’s\r\nconsultations on its working methods held during the period\r\ncovered by the report, as well as the consideration of the\r\nposition paper prepared by 10 Council members on that\r\nissue. We have read the position paper with great interest.\r\nMy country concurs with the recommendations contained\r\ntherein, in particular with those tending in the same\r\ndirection as the proposals presented by the Movement of\r\nNon-Aligned Countries to the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council and\r\nOther Matters Related to the Security Council, proposals on\r\nwhich there is unquestionably general agreement.\r\nIt is of great importance for the informal working\r\ngroup of the Security Council on documentation and other\r\nprocedural matters to continue its consideration of these\r\nmatters so as to arrive at substantive agreements that will\r\ncontribute to transparency and greater democracy in the\r\nfunctioning of the Council.\r\nMr. Yel’chenko (Ukraine): I should like to join\r\nprevious speakers in expressing my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, President of the\r\nSecurity Council for the current month, for presenting the\r\nannual report covering the work of that organ from 16 June\r\n1997 to 15 June 1998.\r\nFor the past several years, consideration of the\r\nCouncil’s annual reports by the General Assembly has\r\noffered a special occasion for addressing a number of\r\nwide-ranging issues relating to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, which ultimately is the\r\nsupreme raison d’être of this world Organization.\r\nJudging from past experience, as well as from the\r\ndebate which is taking place now, this is a good\r\nopportunity to dwell on the substance of the issues before\r\nthe Security Council and to consider the manner in which\r\nit carries out its responsibilities as enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter. Evaluation of the structure and content\r\nof the annual account of the Security Council’s activities\r\nis also an important subject, and we therefore welcome\r\nthe new format of the Council’s report, which contains a\r\nnumber of useful improvements and innovations aimed at\r\nenhancing its analytical nature.\r\nI have no intention of questioning the topicality of\r\nthese subjects, but I would like to place particular\r\nemphasis on the issue of the relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and other current or potential\r\ncontributors to the maintenance of international stability.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed growing demands\r\nfor the development of a strong esprit de corps between\r\nall the actors in contemporary international relations with\r\nthe capability to contribute to the maintenance of peace\r\nand security. These demands are nurtured by the\r\nrealization that a coherent engagement and partnership\r\nbetween the United Nations membership, various organs\r\nof this Organization, its specialized agencies and regional\r\narrangements, as well as other actors, such as non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, constitute an essential\r\ncondition for ensuring the success of the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to address and avert the manifold\r\nthreats to global security.\r\nIn view of the requirement for more integrated and\r\ncoordinated action in this area, we strongly believe that\r\nthe time has come for the Security Council to make a\r\nquantum leap in elevating its relationship with all the\r\nconstituents that make up together what is called the\r\ninternational community. Primary attention in this respect\r\nshould be focused on the relationship of the Security\r\nCouncil with the Member States from which it derives all\r\nits power and responsibility.\r\nIt is undeniable that, over the past few years, the\r\nSecurity Council has taken many worthwhile steps to\r\nincrease the openness and transparency of its activities.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nWe welcome this progress and encourage the Security\r\nCouncil to continue this pursuit. However, all the valuable\r\npractices which the Council has introduced so far cannot\r\nsubstitute for its genuine interaction with the Members of\r\nthe United Nations that are not members of this organ.\r\nMy delegation is strongly convinced that the\r\ncornerstone for such a relationship is laid down in Article\r\n31 of the Charter, which says that\r\n“Any Member of the United Nations which is not\r\na member of the Security Council may participate,\r\nwithout vote, in the discussion of any question brought\r\nbefore the Security Council whenever the latter\r\nconsiders that the interests of that Member are\r\nspecially affected.”\r\nIn the view of my delegation, the contents of Article\r\n31 actually imply that non-members of the Security Council\r\nare provided with the same rights to influence the decisions\r\nof the Council as its members, except for the right to\r\nparticipate in the voting procedure. I think that all we need\r\nnow is strict compliance with this very clear message of\r\nArticle 31. It would be difficult for my delegation to concur\r\nwith any other interpretation of the Charter provisions to\r\nwhich I have referred.\r\nI do not wish to leave the impression that my\r\ndelegation challenges the practice of the Council’s informal\r\nconsultations, which under some circumstances can\r\nrepresent a useful means of facilitating the search for a\r\ncompromise in order to ensure prompt action by the\r\nOrganization. However, neither this practice nor any other\r\nconsideration can prevent the Council from starting a new\r\nphase in the history of its relationship with the increased\r\nmembership of the United Nations as a whole. What we do\r\nchallenge and would like to get rid of is the current modus\r\noperandi under which the overwhelming majority of\r\nMember States are practically excluded from the decision-\r\nmaking process of that very important organ, which, in\r\ncarrying out its duties, acts on their behalf. In this\r\nconnection, I cannot but fully support the concern voiced\r\nby the Permanent Representative of New Zealand with\r\nregard to the Council meeting of 6 June this year.\r\nThe relationship of the Security Council with other\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations is another area in\r\nwhich the provisions of the Charter could be better\r\nexploited in order to strengthen international cooperation in\r\ndealing with traditional as well as new threats to global\r\nstability.\r\nThus, the Security Council’s interaction with the\r\nGeneral Assembly should not be limited to the discussion\r\nof the Council’s report now taking place, even if the\r\nAssembly’s consideration of annual reports of the Council\r\nrepresents some kind of a dialogue between these two\r\nmain organs of the United Nations. As a more far-\r\nreaching step that could significantly elevate such\r\ninteraction, the Security Council should re-evaluate the\r\npotential of its right, enshrined in Articles 11 and 12 of\r\nthe Charter, to request the General Assembly to make\r\nrecommendations with regard to situations threatening\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe economic, social and humanitarian crises that\r\nthreaten global stability compel the international\r\ncommunity to think more seriously about new\r\nmechanisms of multilateral action, as well as new forms\r\nof cooperation between the existing institutions. Thus, we\r\ncannot but note the growing interest in the initiative of\r\nthe President of Ukraine, which he personally presented\r\nin this General Assembly Hall in 1995, to establish a\r\nUnited Nations economic security council.\r\nTouching upon the same problem, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report on the work of the Organization\r\nhighlighted the need for new forms of cooperation\r\nbetween the principal organs of the United Nations and its\r\nMember States. Furthermore, he included a timely\r\nreminder of the dormant provisions of Article 65 of the\r\nCharter, under which the Economic and Social Council\r\nmay furnish information to the Security Council and shall\r\nassist the Security Council upon its request.\r\nIn recent years, the Security Council has intensified\r\nits dialogue with regional and subregional organizations.\r\nWe think that this is a good sign. It is widely believed\r\nthat regional action, as a matter of decentralization,\r\ndelegation and cooperation with the United Nations, can\r\nnot only ease the burden of the Council, but also\r\ncontribute to a deeper sense of general responsibility for\r\nthe present and future of the planet, as well as to the\r\nfurther democratization of international affairs.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations continues to grow and in some\r\ncases has reached considerably higher levels. In particular,\r\nwe would refer to the successful examples of such\r\ncooperation in resolving the conflicts on the territory of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia. These days, the international\r\ncommunity is witnessing the establishment of another\r\nunprecedented pattern of cooperation in its efforts to\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nachieve a peaceful solution of the situation around Kosovo.\r\nHowever, in order to avoid situations in which\r\nregional action, instead of being part of the solution,\r\nbecomes part of the problem, it is imperative to keep the\r\nactivities of regional organizations under the effective\r\ncontrol of the Security Council, as prescribed in Chapter\r\nVIII of the Charter. It is also important to emphasize that,\r\nunder the existing norms of international law, the relevant\r\ndecisions of the Security Council constitute the only\r\ngrounds for enforcement measures that may be taken by\r\nregional organizations, as provided for in Article 53 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nBy offering these brief but certainly not exhaustive\r\nremarks, my intention was to emphasize that the Security\r\nCouncil has a special role to play in establishing a new\r\npattern of international cooperation as we approach a new\r\nera with new challenges.\r\nI would like to conclude by expressing my\r\ndelegation’s gratitude and appreciation to all members of\r\nthe Security Council that have participated in its work\r\nduring the period covered by the report under our\r\nconsideration for their valuable contribution to its activities.\r\nThe manner in which they have performed their duties will\r\nbe beneficial to all the candidates for non-permanent seats\r\nin the Security Council, including my own country,\r\nUkraine, which aspires to be elected to that organ for the\r\nperiod 2000-2001.\r\nThis is also an opportune occasion to offer our\r\ncongratulations to the representatives of Argentina, Canada,\r\nMalaysia, Namibia and the Netherlands on the recent\r\nelection of their countries to serve as non-permanent\r\nmembers in the Security Council, starting 1 January 1999.\r\nMy delegation would like to wish these countries every\r\nsuccess in discharging their very important responsibilities.\r\nMr. Tello (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is today considering the report of the\r\nSecurity Council covering the period from 16 June 1997 to\r\n15 June 1998, submitted in accordance with Article 24,\r\nparagraph 3, and Article 15, paragraph 1, of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations. I should like to thank the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, who is presiding\r\nover the Council for the month of October, for following\r\nthe healthy practice of personally introducing the report.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the members of the\r\nSecurity Council are increasingly sensitive and open to the\r\ncall of the majority of the Members of the United Nations\r\nfor information relating to the daily activities of that\r\nbody. However, we believe that we are far from winning\r\nthe battle for a detailed, substantive and analytical annual\r\nreport.\r\nIt must not be forgotten that we, the Members of the\r\nOrganization, delegate to the Security Council\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. It receives its mandate from us. It must\r\nanswer to us.\r\nAccess to information is a right, not a privilege, of\r\nthe Members of the United Nations. It is the duty of the\r\nmembers of the Security Council to keep others properly\r\ninformed with regard to the issues that it considers and\r\nthe reasons for the decisions that it takes or considers\r\ntaking — decisions that, in accordance with Article 25 of\r\nthe Charter, we all must accept and carry out.\r\nIn this regard, the monthly assessments prepared\r\npersonally by some of the former Security Council\r\nPresidents are extremely useful, because they are\r\nunquestionably more complete and analytical than the\r\nbare factual descriptions included in the section of the\r\nreport relating to the questions considered by the Council\r\nduring the period in question.\r\nWe are particularly grateful to Costa Rica for issuing\r\nits assessment as an official document of the Security\r\nCouncil, and especially for the attachment on working\r\nmethods. Such initiatives are certainly encouraging\r\nbecause they show that within the Council there is a\r\nrecognition of the need to improve the work of that body\r\nand to reflect upon measures that could be taken to that\r\nend.\r\nMy delegation, together with most of the delegations\r\nrepresented here, is convinced that in preparing their\r\nannual report, the members of the Security Council must\r\ntake into account the criteria established in resolution\r\n51/193, adopted on 17 December 1996, in particular the\r\nmeasures referred to in paragraph 4 of that resolution.\r\nIt would be of particular interest to the Assembly to\r\nhave information about what happens in the so-called\r\ninformal consultations of the Council, mysterious\r\nconclaves that have become common practice. In those\r\nclosed meetings, about which we know very little,\r\ndecisions are taken that may affect all of us.\r\nA transparent Security Council that reports fully and\r\nin timely fashion to the General Assembly is a goal that\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nwe can attain only with the cooperation of the members of\r\nthat body. In that respect, we acknowledge the efforts that\r\nhave been made and urge that they be redoubled, taking\r\ninto account the recommendations of the General Assembly,\r\nwhich is the most important, representative and democratic\r\nbody of the United Nations — the body from which the\r\nCouncil derives its authority and jurisdiction. Rather than\r\nmerely receiving an account of events or a compilation of\r\ndocuments, we would like to know the legal and political\r\nfoundations underlying the decisions taken by the Council.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm that Mexico\r\nwill continue to play an active part in deliberations on this\r\nissue that are taking place in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council and\r\nOther Matters Related to the Security Council.\r\nMr. Ortega Urbina (Nicaragua), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): My delegation welcomes this\r\nopportunity to consider the report of the Security Council\r\nto the General Assembly covering the period from 16 June\r\n1997 to 15 June 1998. We would like to express our\r\nappreciation to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, President of the\r\nCouncil for this month, for his excellent introduction of the\r\nreport.\r\nThe work of the Security Council is of the greatest\r\nimportance to all Members of the United Nations, and the\r\nannual report is a useful tool for keeping us informed of the\r\nactivities of the Council. The General Assembly has a\r\nlegitimate interest in the activities of the Council. The\r\nreport must be as informative as possible. The efforts to\r\nmake it more user-friendly are therefore greatly appreciated,\r\nand the more analytical nature of the report demonstrates\r\nthe willingness of the Council to acknowledge requests\r\nmade in previous meetings for better information.\r\nThe General Assembly and the Security Council have\r\ndifferent responsibilities, and the division of labour between\r\nthe two bodies, established by the United Nations Charter,\r\nmust be respected. The Council’s primary responsibility for\r\npreventing conflict and maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity is essential, and nothing must be done that might\r\nreduce the Council’s ability to carry out its responsibilities\r\nin an efficient manner. At the same time, we must\r\nrecognize that questions of peace and security, conflict\r\nprevention and conflict resolution are closely connected to\r\nissues that are the responsibility of the General Assembly.\r\nThese issues include development and the reduction of\r\npoverty, development assistance, efforts aimed at\r\nreconciliation and confidence-building, human rights,\r\nenvironmental issues and the need to provide all countries\r\nwith opportunities to participate in the global economy.\r\nThe activities of the General Assembly are important for\r\ncombating the root causes of conflicts and promoting an\r\ninternational environment conducive to peaceful\r\ncooperation and development. The need for close\r\ncooperation and coordination between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council must be emphasized.\r\nWe have already had the opportunity to commend\r\nthe Secretary-General for the holistic approach chosen in\r\nthe report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\npeace and development in Africa. The report has laid out\r\na path which we, the Member States, should follow.\r\nImportant first steps were taken when this report was\r\nconsidered by both the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. The challenge now before us is to further\r\ndevelop this comprehensive approach to the issues before\r\nthe United Nations while at the same time maintaining a\r\nclear distinction between the responsibilities of the\r\nvarious United Nations bodies.\r\nWe would like to underline the need for greater\r\ntransparency in the work of the Security Council. There\r\nhas been progress over the last few years, and we\r\nappreciate the now-established practices for sharing\r\ninformation with non-members. The regular briefings by\r\nthe President of the Council are important and helpful.\r\nThe informal briefings given by several members of the\r\nCouncil are also very helpful to members of delegations\r\nwho spend a considerable amount of time waiting outside\r\nthe Council’s meeting rooms hoping to pick up\r\ninformation.\r\nWe also support the idea that the Council should\r\nconsider the possibility that meetings which are largely\r\ninformative in nature — such as briefings by the\r\nSecretariat or by the Secretary-General’s special\r\nrepresentatives — be organized as open meetings rather\r\nthan consultations of the whole. This would of course not\r\npreclude the possibility that the Council, after such\r\nbriefings, would conduct closed consultations on the issue\r\nwhen this is considered useful.\r\nNorway has welcomed the principle of open\r\norientation debates on different issues on the Council’s\r\nagenda. We are convinced that this practice can be further\r\ndeveloped. It is of course important to make sure that\r\nsuch debates are organized and scheduled in such a\r\nmanner that the views of the membership at large can be\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\ntaken into account in the Council’s own deliberations on the\r\nissue at hand.\r\nIt is of particular importance to secure openness and\r\ntransparency when peacekeeping operations are considered.\r\nAll countries participating in these operations, including\r\ncountries that participate with civilian personnel in multi-\r\nfunctional operations, have a particular need to be consulted\r\nwhen such operations are discussed. When a mandate for a\r\nnew operation is considered, all potential contributors\r\nshould be given opportunities to present their views. We\r\nappreciate the mechanisms established for this purpose and\r\nunderline the responsibility of all — Council members and\r\ntroop contributors alike — to make full use of such\r\nmechanisms.\r\nTransparency is also important for regional and\r\nsubregional organizations that cooperate with the United\r\nNations. These organizations have proved themselves to be\r\nimportant instruments for the promotion of peace and\r\nsecurity. In Africa, the Organization of African Unity and\r\nsubregional organizations continue to be valuable partners\r\nof the United Nations in its efforts to promote peaceful\r\ndevelopment. In other parts of the world, regional\r\norganizations are also becoming increasingly important in\r\nconflict prevention, crisis management and peace-building.\r\nThe crisis in Kosovo has reminded us what a valuable\r\npartner the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) can be to the Security Council and the\r\nSecretary-General in crisis management in Europe. Our goal\r\nmust be a better unity of purpose and the integration of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts with those of other\r\nstakeholders. Norway will assume the chairmanship of the\r\nOSCE in January next year, and we are determined to\r\nfurther refine the already well-established working\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the OSCE. It\r\nis our firm belief that greater collaboration between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations is needed to\r\nenhance our common ability to prevent conflicts and reduce\r\nthe need for future peacekeeping operations.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating the importance my\r\nGovernment attaches to the work of the Security Council\r\nand to the Council’s ability to carry out its mandate. It goes\r\nwithout saying that the Council can rely on Norway’s\r\ncontinued and loyal support.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): At the outset, allow me to thank\r\nAmbassador Jeremy Greenstock, Permanent Representative\r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland to the United Nations and President of the Security\r\nCouncil for the month of October, for his useful\r\npresentation of the annual report of the Council. This\r\npractice, initiated five years ago and maintained since\r\nthen, enhances the relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council. Our thanks also go\r\nto the Security Council secretariat for its efforts, without\r\nwhich the timely submission of the report would not have\r\nbeen possible.\r\nThe consideration of the Council’s report by the\r\nGeneral Assembly provides a useful occasion for the\r\ngeneral membership to look at how effectively the\r\nCouncil is fulfilling its obligation to ensure the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and also\r\nat the manner in which it is discharging its cardinal\r\nduties. At the same time, this is an occasion for non-\r\nmembers of the Council to present their views on the\r\nchallenges, both present and future, in the important task\r\nof saving ourselves and posterity from the scourge of war,\r\nthus contributing to carrying out the tasks of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMy delegation is very pleased to note that the new\r\nmeasures set out in the note by the President of the\r\nSecurity Council of 12 June 1997 (S/1997/451) are\r\nreflected in both the format and the substance of the\r\nreport before us. This is a most welcome manifestation of\r\nthe importance attached by the Council to the views and\r\ncomments that have been made by the general\r\nmembership over the years on enhancing the transparency\r\nand openness of the work of the Security Council. One of\r\nthe most important of the new elements that further\r\nenhance the substantive and analytical character of the\r\nannual report is the monthly assessments provided by the\r\nformer Presidents of the Security Council for the period\r\nunder report. Although these assessments are prepared by\r\nformer Presidents of the Council under their own\r\nresponsibility, they are the result of consultations\r\ninvolving other members of the Council and thus reflect\r\nthe generally shared perspectives of the Council members.\r\nWe find that some of the assessments are presented in a\r\nbold and frank manner. This enables us to appreciate the\r\ndifferences in perception among Council members on\r\ncertain issues. It is, in our view, an indication of an\r\nincipient democratization in the Council. In this regard,\r\nwe would like to urge that this constructive and healthy\r\ntrend be encouraged as far as possible.\r\nThe statistics provided in the report on the number\r\nof resolutions, decisions and presidential statements of the\r\nCouncil indicate that last year the Council had a vast\r\nagenda, including some dangerous situations in certain\r\nparts of the world, and that the workload of the Council\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nwas heavy. It promises to remain so in view of the issues\r\nand ongoing conflicts of which the Council continues to be\r\nseized.\r\nAs reflected in the report, last year there were new\r\nsituations that threatened peace and security. In dealing\r\nwith these situations, the Council in some instances had to\r\nresort to measures under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nAlthough it is acknowledged that the Security Council has\r\nthe right to take the necessary measures when international\r\npeace and security are clearly threatened, the Council\r\nshould resort to sanctions only after other measures have\r\nbeen duly exhausted. In our view, it is also important that\r\nhumanitarian crises should not be used as pretexts for\r\ninvoking Chapter VII measures. Frequent use of sanctions\r\nby a unique organ such as the Security Council, where\r\ndemocracy is conspicuous by its absence, may be perceived\r\nas the coercive political tool of a few powerful countries on\r\nthe Council rather than as a useful international policy tool\r\nto deal with threats to international peace and security. As\r\nexperience clearly shows, the existing sanctions that have\r\nbeen imposed on some countries are frustratingly difficult\r\nto lift for a variety of reasons, which prolongs the misery\r\nbrought by those sanctions to the countries concerned and\r\nthe economic difficulties of third countries which are\r\nrequired to implement the sanctions. Despite the fact that a\r\nnew trend concerning sanctions is taking shape in the\r\nCouncil, this should not encourage an obvious tendency in\r\nthe Council to resort to sanctions at the first opportunity.\r\nWe would like to suggest that the principles on sanctions\r\nset forth in General Assembly resolution 51/242 should\r\nguide our decision-making on this matter.\r\nSituations which would require the application of\r\nsanctions regimes may be very few. However, their\r\nimplications for regional peace and security are always\r\nserious enough to warrant special arrangements to ensure\r\nthe smooth flow of up-to-date information to the general\r\nmembership on the decisions and activities of the Security\r\nCouncil concerning sanctions regimes. Furthermore, it is\r\nlegitimate for the general membership to expect such\r\ninformation. In this regard, submission of special reports by\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly in accordance\r\nwith Article 24 (3) of the Charter and mechanisms such as\r\nspecial briefings would facilitate the smooth flow of\r\ninformation to the general membership. Myanmar favours\r\nthe view that the Security Council should submit special\r\nreports to the General Assembly on specific important\r\nsituations. These special reports would complement the\r\nannual reports of the Security Council and would promote\r\nand enhance the interactive relationship between the two\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to observe the\r\ncommendable initiatives taken by some Presidents of the\r\nCouncil on the issue of working methods of the Council.\r\nI refer in particular to the position paper on working\r\nmethods of the Security Council prepared by the elected\r\nmembers of the Council. My delegation subscribes to the\r\nproposals contained in the paper for the democratization\r\nand improvement of the working methods and decision-\r\nmaking of the Security Council. It is encouraging that the\r\nmembers of the Council were able to consider the issue,\r\nalthough in a preliminary manner. This signifies that\r\nCouncil members appear to be committed to the\r\nenhancement of transparency and openness in the\r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to state that we, like all\r\nother members, welcome Security Council resolution\r\n1121 (1997), which established the Dag Hammarskjöld\r\nMedal as a tribute to those men and women who have\r\nmade the ultimate sacrifice in peacekeeping operations\r\nunder the operational control and authority of the United\r\nNations.\r\nFinally, I would like to stress that it is the\r\nresponsibility of all of us to enhance the relationship\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council\r\nin all its aspects. As proven by this year’s annual report,\r\nwe do not shy away from this important duty. We believe\r\nthat the present debate on the annual report, together with\r\nother existing mechanisms and channels set up for this\r\npurpose, will make us understand better the priorities and\r\npreferences of both organs. We also hope that the debate\r\nwill contribute to the further improvement of the annual\r\nreport of the Council.\r\nMr. Gambari (Nigeria): The General Assembly is\r\nmeeting today to discuss the report of the Security\r\nCouncil for the past year, submitted for the consideration\r\nof the Assembly. My delegation would like to thank\r\nAmbassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock of the United\r\nKingdom, President of the Council for the month of\r\nOctober 1998, for introducing the report. As usual, the\r\nreport is a guide to the activities of the Council for the\r\nperiod under review. My delegation wishes to take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate its appreciation for the\r\ncomprehensive report, which reflects the ongoing\r\nrationalization of the Council’s documentation and\r\nprocedures.\r\nThe submission of this report by the Security\r\nCouncil and its consideration by the General Assembly\r\nwill enhance the cooperation between the two principal\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\norgans of our Organization. This is essential because the\r\nSecurity Council executes its mandate on behalf of the\r\nwhole membership of the United Nations. We note that\r\nduring the year under review the Council held a total of\r\n103 formal meetings, adopted 61 resolutions and issued 41\r\npresidential statements. This impressive record of activity\r\nshows how seriously the Council takes its assignment of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. However, it\r\nmust work harder to match its record of meetings,\r\nstatements and resolutions with a corresponding record of\r\naccomplishment in order to resolve the conflicts before it.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the\r\nactivities of the Council on matters of direct relevance to\r\nmy region, Africa. Conflicts, especially in the continent of\r\nAfrica, dominated its agenda during the period under\r\nreview. The Council held meetings on the situation in\r\nSierra Leone, the Central African Republic, Angola,\r\nWestern Sahara, Rwanda, the Republic of the Congo and\r\nSomalia, culminating with the recent meetings on the\r\ncauses of conflict in Africa and the promotion of\r\nsustainable peace and development on the continent.\r\nAfrica is indeed endowed with immense natural and\r\nhuman resources. Unfortunately, it has had more than its\r\nfair share of regional and internal conflicts on the Security\r\nCouncil’s agenda. These conflicts have adversely affected\r\nthe unity, security, progress and socio-economic and\r\npolitical development of our continent and have generated\r\nserious apprehensions on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. They have also brought alarming human\r\nsuffering and deprivation, creating swarms of refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons. My delegation is pleased that\r\nthe Council is currently giving special consideration to the\r\nroot causes of these conflicts with a view to finding\r\nappropriate mechanisms to resolve them. Africa is a force\r\nto be reckoned with in international affairs. There can be no\r\nglobal peace or world prosperity without the stability and\r\ndevelopment of the African continent, which must be\r\nassisted to come out of its cycles of instability and poverty.\r\nMy delegation shares the Secretary-General’s views\r\ncontained in his report on African conflicts that long-term\r\nsolutions to conflict situations on our continent require a\r\nholistic approach linking peace, security, good governance,\r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt this juncture it is appropriate to draw attention to\r\nthe link between peace and development. In many conflicts\r\nin Africa and elsewhere, socio-economic inadequacies are\r\na significant aspect of their underlying causes. It is time to\r\nreview our commitment to the linkage between peace and\r\ndevelopment in order to ensure the transformation of the\r\nfragile peace which still exists in many post-conflict\r\nsituations in Africa and elsewhere into real and\r\nsustainable peace. Our actions and decisions in our quest\r\nfor a peaceful and secure world must be guided by the\r\nfact that peace and development are mutually reinforcing.\r\nHowever, my delegation wishes to reiterate here the\r\nneed for the urgent reform and democratization of the\r\nworking methods and procedures of the Security Council\r\nin order to enhance its transparency, its legitimacy and,\r\nultimately, its effectiveness. The membership should be\r\nexpanded in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories. We have continued to assert that Africa\r\ndeserves two permanent seats in a reformed and expanded\r\nSecurity Council. We have also stated unequivocally that\r\nthe present status quo whereby Africa — with 53 Member\r\nStates of the Organization — has no permanent seats in\r\nthe Security Council is both unacceptable and increasingly\r\nuntenable.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must also\r\nencompass the proper relationship between it and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This relationship ought to be improved\r\nupon in terms of closer cooperation, closer coordination\r\nand more regular consultation in order to enhance the\r\noverall effectiveness of the work of our Organization. The\r\nAssembly should play a more active role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, a domain\r\nthat has so far been dominated by the Council. After all,\r\nalthough the Security Council has the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, it does not have exclusive responsibility for\r\nit.\r\nWe cannot end this statement without drawing\r\nattention to the now obvious fact that the Security\r\nCouncil needs the initiatives of regional institutions as a\r\nnecessary adjunct to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The success story of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) in the West African\r\nsubregion, especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone, clearly\r\ndemonstrates that such regional initiatives, where they\r\nexist, stand a far greater chance of success if they are\r\nadequately and promptly supported by the Security\r\nCouncil in its peace-making and peacekeeping efforts.\r\nThis success is further proof of the necessity for\r\ncooperation and consultation between the United Nations\r\nand subregional organizations. ECOMOG represents a\r\nunique initiative by a subregional organization within the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nframework of regional arrangements with regard to crisis\r\nmanagement and conflict resolution.\r\nFinally, we would like to remind the Security Council\r\nnot to relent in its efforts to provide ECOMOG with the\r\ntechnical and logistical support it requires to execute its\r\nongoing mandate in Sierra Leone. We appreciate the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to strengthen the United Nations\r\noffice in Freetown, as well as its involvement in the\r\ndisarmament and demobilization of the combatants and the\r\ndeployment of military liaison and security advisory\r\npersonnel to Freetown. However, it is our view that much\r\nmore needs to be done on the part of the international\r\ncommunity to strengthen cooperation in very concrete and\r\nreal terms between the United Nations, on the one hand,\r\nand subregional and regional organizations, on the other\r\nhand, in their complementary role in the maintenance of\r\nglobal peace and security.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): It\r\nis a pleasure for me to extend my thanks to Ambassador\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock, the Permanent Representative of the\r\nUnited Kingdom and President of the Security Council for\r\nthe month of October, for presenting to the General\r\nAssembly the report of the Council for the period 16 June\r\n1997 to 15 June 1998. I would also like to extend my\r\nthanks to the Secretariat for the preparation of the excellent\r\nreport submitted to us.\r\nI would first like to begin by making two general\r\ncomments. First, the submission to the General Assembly\r\nof the annual report by the Security Council is a\r\nconstitutional requirement in accordance with the provisions\r\nof Article 15 of the Charter. It highlights the fact that the\r\nCouncil is accountable to the Assembly in its capacity as\r\nrepresenting the United Nations membership on whose\r\nbehalf the Council undertakes its tasks. Indeed, the report\r\nrepresents the link and the concrete relationship between the\r\ntwo organs spelt out by the Charter, in particular with\r\nregard to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe discussion of the Council’s report is a key tool for\r\nthe General Assembly to carry out its mandate in following\r\nup on the work of the Council and to discuss the measures\r\ntaken by the Council in order to issue recommendations\r\nrelative to these matters. I would like to say here that,\r\nalong with the provisions of the Charter governing the\r\nrelationship between the Assembly and the Council, the\r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice\r\ndelivered in 1962 contributed a great deal in confirming this\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council in an official manner.\r\nSecondly, many of the points I will make have\r\nalready been adopted in General Assembly resolution\r\n51/193, adopted on 17 December 1996. The primary\r\nobjective of that resolution was to provide international\r\naffirmation of the relationship between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council and to provide the\r\ngreatest possible amount of democratization and\r\ntransparency in international relations.\r\nWe must admit here that the present report\r\nrepresents a notable improvement over previous ones. It\r\nis more coherent and user-friendly, and we appreciate\r\nthis. However, I think there is great room for\r\nimprovement, and here I should like to remind the\r\nAssembly of the paper submitted by the group of 10 —\r\nthe countries that are non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, including Egypt — on 22 December\r\n1997, and which the President of the Council, the\r\nAmbassador of Costa Rica, attached to his report as\r\nSecurity Council President for that month and which\r\nincluded recommendations to improve the working\r\nmethods of the Council.\r\nIn this context, allow me to make the following\r\ncomments.\r\nFirst, this year’s report is still using the narrative\r\nstyle, which we have always criticized. As a result, the\r\nreader of the report cannot sense what are the real\r\ncurrents of thought prevailing in the Council. We believe\r\nthat the report should be divided into objective, analytical\r\nand descriptive parts, thereby reflecting the background\r\nfor the issues considered by the Council, its activities\r\nover the year and the viewpoints of all the parties\r\ninvolved, as well as the circumstances surrounding the\r\nadoption by the Council of its various resolutions, on\r\nevery issue.\r\nFor the report to bear fruit, the General Assembly\r\nshould be able, after considering it, to give its specific\r\nopinion on the issues covered by the report, either through\r\nan independent follow-up outside the purview of the\r\nmandate of the Council or through specific\r\nrecommendations to the Council with respect to its\r\nopinion on the issue, in accordance with the text of\r\nArticle 10 of the Charter.\r\nSecond, one might say that the report, to a large\r\nextent, still seems like a compendium of documents\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nalready distributed to and read by Member States, which is\r\na waste of time and money. It is not really of value from a\r\nfunctional or a political perspective, and runs counter to the\r\nUnited Nations austerity policy. Anyone who is interested\r\nin the issues discussed by the Council does not need to\r\ndrown in endless lists of the titles of communications\r\nreceived by the Council or resolutions adopted by it, and so\r\non. I think that the report can merely cover documents\r\nwhich are not included in the compendium of the Security\r\nCouncil’s decisions and resolutions.\r\nThird, any organ, to function effectively, needs a\r\nconstitutional framework governing its responsibilities,\r\nmandate, rights and duties. It also requires a procedural\r\nframework that defines its modus operandi. We do not\r\nthink that the Council can continue its work without clear\r\nrules of procedure governing its methods of work, because\r\nthe rules of the Council are still provisional — and here I\r\ndo not deal with why they have remained provisional all\r\nthese years — and they do not apply, for example, to\r\nclosed consultations in which everything done by the\r\nCouncil is prepared. For example, a State cannot just ask to\r\nparticipate in private meetings to express its point of view\r\nbefore the Council on a matter of interest to it, though the\r\nprovisions of Article 31 of the Charter and of rule 37 of the\r\nrules of procedure allow this.\r\nFourth, it is said that there are undefined and\r\nunrecorded practices that govern the Council’s closed\r\nconsultations. These have developed as a matter of custom\r\nand have no written records. The group of 10 non-\r\npermanent members of the Council specifically highlighted,\r\nin the introduction to the paper submitted in December\r\n1997 and which I mentioned earlier, that\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“A process of registration of such practices should be\r\nembarked upon to provide elements of clarity and\r\ncertainty without in any way hindering the Council\r\nfrom developing and further articulating these\r\npractices.”\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nI think that this is very important because the Council does\r\nnot work in a procedural void.\r\nFifth, the descriptive part of the report should contain\r\na factual summary of discussions held in private sessions,\r\nespecially, and as I mentioned earlier, in view of the fact\r\nthat the Council carries out the bulk of its work at\r\nprivate, non-recorded private meetings.\r\nSixth, the assessment made by the President of the\r\nCouncil, under his own responsibility and in his own\r\ncapacity, represents progress yet does not express the\r\nopinion of the members of the Council. It is also an\r\ninstant photographic record of what happens inside the\r\nCouncil, and here we think that the assessment should\r\nhave an analytical element and should be adopted by the\r\nCouncil itself.\r\nSeventh, holding meetings under the “Arria formula”\r\nis a good practice which we encourage, but in order for\r\nit to be fully beneficial, it must be more flexible, because\r\nuntil now it has taken the form of private meetings to\r\nwhich usually high officials coming from capitals are\r\ninvited to meet with Council members. We think that\r\nthese meetings should be open to Permanent\r\nRepresentatives. The report should contain an objective\r\ndescription of those meetings or deliberations. No further\r\nproof of the need for records for the Council’s meetings\r\nis required beyond the fact that the members of the\r\nCouncil had asked Ambassador Arria of Venezuela last\r\nyear to remind them of the background for his initiative,\r\nin this regard.\r\nEighth, the report lacks an analysis of the situations\r\nleading to the imposition of sanctions and of the\r\nobjectives and consequences of such sanctions. I think\r\nthat an evaluation of the results achieved is needed in the\r\nreport to assess how effective the sanctions are, how\r\nsupportive they are of, or in consonance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations, and their\r\nimpact on the domestic and regional fronts of the targeted\r\ncountry. Here we would like to draw the attention of the\r\nCouncil to the working paper on sanctions adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly within the framework of “An Agenda\r\nfor Peace”. We were hoping that the Council would\r\nbenefit from it.\r\nIn this connection, I think that the Council should\r\nthink about affording members on which sanctions are\r\ngoing to be imposed and other affected States the\r\nopportunity of expressing their views to the Security\r\nCouncil before such sanctions are imposed or renewed.\r\nNinth, the meetings of the sanctions Committee\r\nshould be official and public, with records taken during\r\nprivate sessions, both of which should be featured in the\r\nreport.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nTenth, we welcome the continued practice of holding\r\nconsultations between the Council and Members\r\ncontributing troops to peacekeeping operations. However,\r\nin order for the consultations to really understand the reality\r\nof the problems faced by such forces in the field, they\r\nshould not become routine meetings. I think that allowing\r\nthe troop-contributing States enough time to consider the\r\nvarious relevant reports of the Secretary-General would\r\nincrease their objective contribution, thereby enriching the\r\nmeetings by allowing both the political and military\r\ndimensions to be taken into account. The report should\r\nobjectively reflect the deliberations of such meetings instead\r\nof merely stating when they were held, as is the case with\r\nthe present report. It is high time the Council invited troop-\r\ncontributing countries to partake in decision-making\r\nregarding the use of armed forces of Members, in\r\naccordance with Article 44 of the Charter.\r\nFinally, in accordance with Article 24, paragraph 3, of\r\nthe Charter, along with the annual report submitted by the\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly, special reports are\r\nrequired on specific issues of which the Council is seized.\r\nHere I would like to remind the Assembly again of the\r\njoint paper submitted to the Council by Egypt and\r\nIndonesia in 1996. It included an exhaustive list of cases in\r\nwhich the Council should submit special reports to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, I have unfortunately to express my\r\nregret that the report of the Council to the General\r\nAssembly did not heed the recommendations of General\r\nAssembly resolution 51/193. Nor does it explain why that\r\nresolution was not heeded.\r\nOne final point: I hope that the Security Council will\r\nheed the rising calls for a fresh look into its working\r\nmethods so that whatever actions it may take will have\r\nmore credibility and legitimacy.\r\nMr. Amorim (Brazil) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nIt is a pleasure to see you, Sir, chairing our work.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Jeremy Greenstock, for his balanced and\r\nobjective presentation of this year’s report to the General\r\nAssembly. We attach great value to this practice, which\r\nwas introduced in 1993 by my predecessor, Ambassador\r\nSardenberg, and we are glad to note that it has now become\r\nan established tradition.\r\nThe Security Council has continued to meet on an\r\nalmost daily basis during the period covered by this\r\nyear’s report — and in the four months that have elapsed\r\nsince then — to tackle a multiplicity of challenges in\r\ndifferent parts of the world. To start with our own region,\r\nwe note that there is only one remaining item on the\r\nCouncil’s agenda that deals with a country in the\r\nAmericas — specifically, the situation in Haiti. Although\r\nthe return of democratic rule to that sister nation has yet\r\nto give rise to the kind of institutional consolidation\r\nconducive to an improved social and economic\r\nenvironment, Haiti’s problems should not continue to be\r\nviewed indefinitely through the prism of the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nIn line with the philosophy espoused by the\r\nSecretary-General in his latest report on the work of the\r\nOrganization — a philosophy that we ourselves have been\r\nadvocating — the time has come for placing Haiti in a\r\ndifferent United Nations context, with the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the General Assembly taking up their\r\nresponsibilities in promoting longer-term peace-building\r\ntasks, which the Security Council is not in a position to\r\nassume and should not assume.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan’s recent trip to Latin\r\nAmerica, which included visits to Brazil, Argentina,\r\nUruguay and Mexico, came at a moment of heightened\r\nregional awareness of the importance of international\r\ncooperation for the peaceful settlement of disputes. As we\r\nmake strides to harmonize and integrate our region on the\r\nbasis of shared humanism and respect for international\r\nlaw, we also remain intent on stressing our commitment\r\nto the multilateral system for the maintenance of peace\r\nand security, as embodied in the United Nations Charter.\r\nLatin America has played a pioneering role in building up\r\nand living by a culture of peace. The Treaty of Tlatelolco\r\nestablished the first nuclear-weapon-free zone 30 years\r\nago. The few remaining territorial disputes in the area are\r\nbeing effectively dealt with by diplomatic negotiation.\r\nOnly a few months ago, at the southernmost tip of South\r\nAmerica, in Argentina, the declaration of Ushuaia was\r\nadopted, on the creation of a zone of peace and\r\ncooperation free from weapons of mass destruction — a\r\nzone encompassing the six countries that are members or\r\nassociated States of the Southern Cone Common Market:\r\nArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia and Chile.\r\nAs we aspire to associate peace with justice and\r\ngreater economic opportunity for all, in our part of the\r\nworld we will continue to work closely with those in\r\nother regions who share these aspirations and are ready to\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\njoin hands in promoting a worldwide move away from\r\nbelligerence and instability, with a strong United Nations at\r\nits centre. We are happy that next year we will have the\r\ncompany of Argentina in the Council. We would also like\r\nto acknowledge the excellent contribution made by Costa\r\nRica.\r\nCurrent trends, however, do not allow us to feel\r\nentirely confident that the world is becoming a safer place\r\nor that the Security Council’s authority is not at risk. As the\r\nmore utopian expectations raised by the end of the cold war\r\nsubside, it is disquieting to note the persistence of\r\nintractable conflicts in the Middle East, the Balkans and the\r\nfringes of the former Soviet Union, as well as in several\r\nparts of Africa. The nuclear testing in South Asia has added\r\na new and worrisome dimension to that region’s security\r\nproblems.\r\nAt the same time, it may be even more unsettling to\r\nwitness our commonly accepted basis for legitimate\r\ninternational action in the field of peace and security — the\r\nUnited Nations Charter — being circumvented, for\r\nwhatever reasons. Without going into the individual merits\r\nof specific decisions by regional organizations and other\r\nnon-universal bodies, these waivers — proclaimed outside\r\nthe United Nations legal standard — are symptomatic of a\r\nlack of confidence in the Council’s judgement, which\r\nshould be a matter for deep reflection by all Member\r\nStates. It would be truly disheartening if the post-cold-war\r\nperiod, instead of setting the stage for an era of greater\r\ninternational cohesion, were to degenerate into new patterns\r\nof fragmentation and spheres of influence, to the detriment\r\nof the principles and objectives of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nThis Organization experienced a moment of renewed\r\nconfidence in its capacity to articulate constructive\r\ndiplomatic responses to international crises when Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan returned from Baghdad with a\r\nMemorandum of Understanding re-establishing cooperation\r\nbetween the Iraqi Government and the United Nations\r\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM). Nevertheless, a sustained\r\npattern for such cooperation has yet to be achieved. Until\r\nthe day that Iraq is in full compliance with its obligations,\r\nthe Security Council will not be in a position to turn the\r\npage on the consequences of its past aggression against\r\nKuwait. At present, the concept of a comprehensive review\r\nof what has been achieved and what is lacking under the\r\nsanctions regime offers the best possibility for progress and\r\ndeserves to be approached in earnest. Full cooperation by\r\nIraq with UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency must, of course, be established beforehand.\r\nIn Africa, the promise of peace associated with the\r\nend of apartheid has yet to be translated into the true\r\nAfrican renaissance imagined by Nelson Mandela. The\r\nstark contrast offered by the nightmarish conflict in\r\nAngola would suffice to dispel any illusions. The defiance\r\nwith which Jonas Savimbi continues to systematically\r\nflout his repeated commitments to disarm and join in the\r\nbuilding of his country has provoked, in the region and\r\nbeyond, a degree of outrage that is reserved only for a\r\nhandful of other notorious figures in our contemporary\r\nworld. Still, no end to the suffering of the Angolan people\r\nis in sight, while the Council seems powerless to make\r\nsure that its own resolutions are implemented.\r\nIn the Balkans the cycle of intolerance unleashed by\r\nthe fragmentation of the former Yugoslavia is still\r\nrunning its course of pain and devastation. We have\r\nfollowed with increasing uneasiness the plight of the\r\nKosovar people and agree with those who believe that the\r\ninternational community has a collective responsibility to\r\nprevent humanitarian crises from degenerating into human\r\ncatastrophes. The international community must try to\r\nreach a better understanding, however, on the multilateral\r\nbasis for resorting to coercion on humanitarian grounds.\r\nThe open debate in the Security Council on this issue —\r\nwhich took place very recently, in September — did not\r\ncome to a clear convergence of views, and further\r\ndiscussion is certainly necessary on this matter. Let us\r\nrecall that, however, that at present the only accepted\r\nbasis for using force without Security Council\r\nauthorization is Article 51 of the Charter, which provides\r\nfor the legitimate right to self-defence. This provision\r\ndoes not allow for enlarged interpretation.\r\nThe Security Council’s credibility was greatly\r\nenhanced at the beginning of this decade, when it\r\nappeared that working towards consensus was in the best\r\ninterest of all its Members. But as the international\r\ncommunity grapples with the turbulence provoked by\r\nfinancial instability, and potentially destabilizing\r\nprecedents are established in the international political\r\nsphere, some observers have begun to talk — somewhat\r\nominously — of the end of the relatively benign post-\r\ncold-war period.\r\nIn order to re-establish confidence in our institutions\r\nand in our capacity to work towards consensus, we must\r\nagree on certain fundamentals. United States President\r\nBill Clinton, in his courageous statement made in Rwanda\r\nin March, pointed out that the only crucial division among\r\nthe peoples of the world at the dawn of the new\r\nmillennium is the line between those who embrace the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\ncommon humanity we all share and those who reject it;\r\nthose who find meaning in life through respect and\r\ncooperation and those who embrace war. This is a\r\npronouncement with which we agree entirely.\r\nSuch a philosophy is incompatible with an attachment\r\nto outdated oppositions between East and West or between\r\nNorth and South. It is diametrically opposed to the dark\r\nprophecies contained in false notions such as the so-called\r\nclash of civilizations. Peoples from all walks of life,\r\nirrespective of creed, culture, or ethnic background, are\r\nbeginning to appreciate the benefits of cross-fertilization\r\nbetween different traditions. Today it is possible to contend\r\nthat the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi is just as relevant to the\r\nmoral upbringing of students in industrialized countries as\r\nis that of Raoul Wallenberg to those of developing ones.\r\nOur times have made a reassessment of old stereotypes\r\npossible and a better understanding of our common destiny\r\nas a species an imperative. Concepts of East and West,\r\nNorth and South, have to be seen in this perspective.\r\nThe only instruments at our disposal that will succeed\r\nin joining together all those who embrace our common\r\nhumanity are those capable of being perceived by the entire\r\ninternational community as representative of universal\r\ninterests. The United Nations is the only such organ in the\r\nfield of peace and security. The Security Council should be\r\nits respected voice. We must strive to preserve its authority\r\nand work towards its enhanced stature.\r\nIn order to ensure that the Security Council does\r\nindeed maintain its role in promoting peace in the years to\r\ncome, it will be essential for Member States to confront the\r\nurgent need to finalize the process of United Nations\r\nreform by agreeing on the shape of an expanded and\r\nmodernized Council. The elements of a reform that is both\r\nmeaningful and feasible are known to each and every one\r\nof us. They involve expansion in the two categories of\r\nmembers, permanent and non-permanent, with the presence\r\nof developing countries in both of them, on a non-\r\ndiscriminatory basis vis-à-vis developed nations. Reform\r\nalso implies added transparency both within the Security\r\nCouncil — in the relation between permanent and non-\r\npermanent members — and in the relations of the Security\r\nCouncil with other bodies, particularly the General\r\nAssembly. It requires a decision-making process that\r\ncombines fairness with effectiveness, realism with equity.\r\nThe gradual erosion of the legitimacy and credibility\r\nof the Security Council is not a risk for the distant future.\r\nIt is a process that has already started. It is incumbent upon\r\nus, Member States, to stop this process and indeed to\r\nreverse it. Reform is not a panacea. It will not change by\r\nmagical fiat the old thinking of some and the diffidence\r\nof others. But it is an indispensable requirement. We may\r\nchoose to ignore it only at our own peril.\r\nMr. Sáenz Biolley (Costa Rica) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Costa Rica is particularly gratified, Sir, to see\r\nyou presiding over our meeting today. We are glad to\r\nparticipate in the consideration of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly covering its\r\nwork during the period from 16 June 1997 to 15 June\r\n1998.\r\nOver the last 22 months, my delegation has been\r\nhonoured to represent the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States as one of the elected members of the\r\nSecurity Council. In that capacity, Costa Rica has striven\r\nto be a worthy representative of our Group and to\r\npromote the basic principles of our foreign policy: the\r\npromotion of human rights, respect for international\r\nhumanitarian law, fulfilment of the principle of non-\r\nintervention, absolute compliance with the prohibition of\r\nthe use of force and the promotion of democracy as the\r\nbest way to achieve the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nWe are convinced that the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil must necessarily be guided by these clear-cut and\r\ngenerally applicable principles. We believe that a constant\r\neffort must be made to avoid yielding to the temptation to\r\nseek pragmatic and easy ways out of the crises that the\r\nSecurity Council addresses. We believe that, since the\r\nSecurity Council deals with the most serious and sensitive\r\nsituations affecting international relations and threatening\r\npeace and security, the Council should seek correct and\r\nlasting solutions to such crises.\r\nIn the context of the consideration of the report of\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly, I wish to\r\nhighlight just a few aspects of the work of the Council.\r\nFirst of all, I will note the complex nature of the causes\r\nof crises and the need to find integrated solutions to them,\r\nincluding the carrying out of multidisciplinary\r\npeacekeeping missions and operations. Secondly, I will\r\ndraw attention to the need for the Council, in its\r\nproceedings, to observe strictly the principles of\r\nsovereignty and sovereign equality of States, as well as\r\nthe norms embodied in the Charter of the Organization.\r\nThirdly, I will refer to the need for the measures adopted\r\nby the Security Council — in particular, sanctions — to\r\nadhere strictly to international humanitarian law and to be\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nlimited exclusively to such measures as may be absolutely\r\nnecessary.\r\nFurthermore, taking into account the fact that the bulk\r\nof the Security Council’s work in this period has been\r\nfocused on Africa, I shall be referring to the situation in\r\nthat continent. I shall also be mentioning the nuclear tests\r\nthat took place in May this year, which, in our view,\r\nrepresent one of the gravest events that took place in the\r\nperiod under consideration.\r\nFirst of all, all the crises that are on the agenda of the\r\nSecurity Council have complex causes. Nowadays, the\r\nsources of threats to international peace and security\r\ntranscend traditional concepts and include economic and\r\nsocial issues, and in particular, issues relating to the failure\r\nto respect human rights. We believe that we must move on\r\nfrom the traditional concept of political armed conflicts\r\namong States to embrace a much more integrated and\r\ncomprehensive concept of threats to peace and security.\r\nSuch a concept would include situations of extreme\r\npoverty, critical economic and social underdevelopment, the\r\nviolation of human rights, massive flows of refugees or\r\ninternally displaced persons, ethnically-based civil wars,\r\nextreme degradation of the environment, terrorism and even\r\ncertain socio-political phenomena such as corruption, drug-\r\ntrafficking, international crime, fundamentalism and\r\nintolerance, all of which have become required items on the\r\nglobal security agenda.\r\nWe believe that we must find multidisciplinary\r\nsolutions to these crises and develop and establish specific\r\nproposals and mechanisms for well-defined action in\r\nresponse. In this context, peacekeeping missions cannot\r\ncontinue to be designed exclusively from the military\r\nperspective, but must also include political and\r\nhumanitarian components. Today, peace and security can be\r\nbuilt only through a comprehensive undertaking that goes\r\nbeyond ceasefire monitoring to encompass other,\r\nindispensable elements in the transition process from\r\nconflict to peace and democracy, such as the promotion of\r\neconomic development and human rights, the building of\r\ntrust among various political actors, and the monitoring of\r\nelections.\r\nSecondly, it is essential that the Security Council\r\nscrupulously respect in its proceedings the principles of\r\nsovereignty and the sovereign equality of States, as well as\r\nthe norms embodied in the Charter of the Organization. The\r\nSecurity Council acts on behalf of all States Members of\r\nthe United Nations when it discharges its primary function\r\nof maintaining international peace and security. That is why\r\nthe Council’s activities should not and cannot be secrets\r\nkept from States Members of the Organization. Its\r\nfunctions require the basic criterion of transparency. The\r\nSecurity Council’s action must also be effective, however.\r\nWe must therefore acknowledge that, on certain\r\noccasions — exceptional, to be sure — some\r\nconfidentiality and privacy are required in the decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nMoreover, if the Security Council is to work\r\neffectively, it must receive the broadest possible\r\ninformation from the membership. This need, together\r\nwith the basic criterion of due process, requires the strict\r\napplication of Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter, which\r\npermit States Members of the Organization which are not\r\nmembers of the Security Council to participate in\r\ndiscussions without the right to vote.\r\nThese considerations prompted the elected members\r\nof the Security Council, in December 1997, to present a\r\nposition paper on the Council’s working methods. The\r\ndocument is reflected in the report under consideration as\r\npart of the monthly assessment prepared by my delegation\r\nfor December 1997. Many aspects of this position paper\r\nhave been incorporated into that organ’s practices.\r\nUnfortunately, some key proposals have yet to be\r\nincorporated.\r\nAs we noted in that paper, we take the view that the\r\nconvening of open meetings of the Security Council\r\nshould be the norm. Informal consultations, in the strict\r\ntechnical-legal sense, are not meetings of the Security\r\nCouncil. No decision may be taken at such consultations,\r\nnor do they fulfil the obligations articulated in Articles 31\r\nand 32 of our Charter. We believe that all States\r\nMembers of the Organization, and in particular the States\r\ndirectly interested, are entitled to express their views on\r\nsituations under consideration by the Council in the\r\nearliest stages of that consideration.\r\nWe also believe that the Secretary-General and his\r\nrepresentatives should submit their reports to the Security\r\nCouncil more frequently and in public meetings. It is\r\nsimply unacceptable for the Secretary-General to regard\r\ncertain information as secret and for most Members of the\r\nOrganization not to have access to it. We therefore call\r\non the Secretary-General in the future to present his\r\nreports, as a general rule, at public meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nFurthermore, we are particularly glad to welcome the\r\nincorporation of the monthly assessments prepared by\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nformer Presidents of the Security Council into the annual\r\nreport to the General Assembly. We believe that the\r\ninclusion of these assessments represents a significant\r\ncontribution to the quality of the report before us.\r\nThirdly, we feel that the measures adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council, in particular sanctions, should conform\r\nstrictly to international law and to healthy political thinking.\r\nThe adoption of any measure that entails the use of force\r\nor military elements must satisfy all the vital legal, political\r\nand strategic requirements. Any action of this kind requires\r\nthe clear authorization of the Security Council in each\r\nspecific case, and we do not believe that authorizations\r\nshould be granted without clear limits or a basis in a\r\nsubsequent decision of other organs or groups of States. To\r\ndo so would involve the Security Council’s renunciation of\r\nits primary and untransferable responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This\r\nconsideration is particularly pertinent nowadays, especially\r\nin the light of developments in the Balkans.\r\nAny measure adopted by the Security Council must\r\nclearly define its political, strategic and practical goals, as\r\nwell as a pre-established programme of subsequent action.\r\nIn any event, any measure taken should guarantee the\r\nprovision of humanitarian assistance to the victims of\r\nconflict and the scrupulous respect for and promotion of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nWhen the measures adopted take the form of sanctions\r\nor prohibitions, these should comply strictly with\r\ninternational humanitarian law and be confined exclusively\r\nto such measures as are absolutely indispensable. We feel\r\nthat sanctions are solely a means of collective self-defence\r\nfor the international community, designed exclusively to\r\nexert pressure on Governments or authorities that threaten\r\npeace and security. That is why sanctions should not\r\nbecome a method — more or less covert — of intervening\r\nin affairs that fall essentially within the domestic\r\njurisdiction of States. They should be used as a last resort,\r\nbefore the use of force is authorized, in cases in which\r\nthere is a clear and objective threat to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn addition, and as a necessary corollary to the\r\naforementioned principles, sanctions should always be\r\ninterpreted and applied so as to ensure the well-being of the\r\ncivilian population. Humanitarian exceptions are vital\r\nelements of any sanctions regime. In this respect, my\r\ndelegation prefers sanctions designed to punish the leaders\r\nresponsible for unlawful policies directly, rather than the\r\npopulation at large. This kind of sanction, however, should\r\nbe particularly respectful of the human rights of the\r\nindividuals involved, make the assumption of innocence\r\nand avoid affecting minors. Moreover, because of their\r\npunitive nature, sanctions should be interpreted in a\r\nrestrictive way by those responsible for implementing\r\nthem.\r\nSimilarly, my delegation does not accept the\r\nexistence of perpetual sanctions. Any sanctions regime\r\nmust be temporary and based on clear and objectively\r\ndeterminable conditions for its lifting. A sanctions regime\r\nthat is not subject to a deadline is in itself a violation of\r\nthe basic rules of peaceful coexistence among people. In\r\nthis context, we welcome the new developments with\r\nrespect to the Lockerbie terrorist attack and the sanctions\r\nagainst Libya.\r\nCosta Rica also believes that sanctions must\r\nnecessarily be accompanied by dialogue among the parties\r\nso as to enable the Government subject to a sanctions\r\nregime to change its policies and thus adapt its conduct to\r\nthe requirements of the international community.\r\nSanctions are not an end in themselves, but should be part\r\nof an overall strategy designed to find a peaceful political\r\nsolution to the crisis from which they have arisen. Costa\r\nRica therefore supports the Secretary-General’s proposal\r\nfor a comprehensive review of the relationship with Iraq\r\nas soon as that country resumes its cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations Special Commission and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency.\r\nIn the period under consideration, the Security\r\nCouncil’s agenda was dominated by various crises in\r\nAfrica. Experience has taught us that the use of force has\r\nnot settled African disputes or resolved the serious\r\nproblems besetting the peoples of that continent. On the\r\ncontrary, those wars have exacerbated the human tragedy.\r\nWe must acknowledge that the international\r\ncommunity cannot and must not seek to impose on\r\nAfrican countries external solutions that are alien to their\r\nway of life and their national and regional experiences. It\r\nis for Africans themselves to define and establish, through\r\ntheir own regional and subregional structures, their own\r\nmodels for achieving peace, development and respect for\r\nfundamental freedoms and rights. In this regard, we\r\nbelieve that a new vision is required for African\r\ncountries, one that takes into account their exceptional\r\nsituation and their own priorities and is designed to\r\npromote the building of a genuine and sustainable peace.\r\nIn this context, it is furthermore vital, in parallel with that\r\nprocess, for the leaders of Africa to show a creative,\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nresponsible and unprejudiced attitude with regard to a\r\nnumber of political issues.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to refer to the nuclear tests\r\ncarried out in Asia in May this year. My delegation\r\nbelieves that among all the events of the period under\r\nconsideration, those tests have some of the widest\r\nrepercussions. We believe that they are a challenge to the\r\nrepeatedly expressed will of the international community,\r\na dangerous ingredient in the build-up of nuclear tensions\r\nand an assault on international peace and security. We are\r\nafraid that similar incidents may occur in the future, forcing\r\nthe Security Council to consider the matter once again.\r\nFor my delegation, these months have been a period\r\nof arduous labour. Our commitment to the basic principles\r\nthat I outlined earlier — respect for sovereignty, sovereign\r\nequality, democracy and human rights — has remained\r\nunswerving, while at the same time we have striven to\r\napply these principles to the harsh realities faced by the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Li Hyong Chol (Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea): First of all, I should like to say that my\r\ndelegation takes note of the report of the Security Council\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly.\r\nIn ensuring international peace and security, in\r\nconformity with the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, the responsibility of the Security Council\r\nis important indeed, which is why all Member States are\r\npaying special attention to the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe attention given by Member States to the activities\r\nof the Security Council has increased considerably,\r\nparticularly in the present international situation, after the\r\nend of the cold war. A large number of countries expect the\r\nSecurity Council to act properly, in accordance with the\r\nfunctions and principles envisaged in the United Nations\r\nCharter, and their enthusiasm to directly participate in and\r\ncontribute to the Council’s activities is growing more than\r\nit ever has before.\r\nThis reality gives rise to the need for United Nations\r\nMembers to review in detail and from a new angle all\r\naspects of Security Council activities and to bring about\r\nradical changes, so as to ensure that the Security Council\r\nmakes a real contribution to the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe non-permanent members of the Security Council\r\nare elected, and the Council carries out its duties on\r\nbehalf of the general United Nations membership,\r\npursuant to Articles 23 and 24 of the United Nations\r\nCharter. It is therefore certain that the Security Council\r\nshould have its work reviewed and assessed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which comprises 185 Member States.\r\nWe should seize the opportunity to do so during our\r\ndeliberations on the item now before us.\r\nIn my delegation’s view, it is essential for the\r\nSecurity Council to ensure impartiality and transparency\r\nin all its activities. In this regard it is important for the\r\nSecurity Council to decisively improve the quality of its\r\nannual report. The report presented to the General\r\nAssembly lacks information needed for correctly assessing\r\nthe annual work of the Security Council. It is of a\r\nprocedural nature, containing only the dates of meetings,\r\nresolutions and so forth. Accordingly, the report does not\r\nhelp us to have a proper understanding of the Council’s\r\nactivities.\r\nThe Council’s annual report presented to the General\r\nAssembly should certainly give a substantive and\r\nanalytical account of its annual work, not simply remind\r\nMembers of the records of the meeting — which have\r\nalready been made public — so that the positive and\r\nnegative aspects of the Council’s work can be\r\ndifferentiated. For this purpose, the report should include\r\ndetailed information concerning, in particular, the process\r\nof adopting and implementing resolutions and of informal\r\nconsultations and the activities of the subsidiary organs of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIn recent years we have often heard complaints from\r\nMember States that the activities of the Security Council\r\nlack impartiality and transparency and that the Council is\r\ndealing with disputes in an unjust manner according to\r\nthe will of certain countries. In order for the Security\r\nCouncil to make a real contribution to the maintenance of\r\npeace and security through just activities, it should discard\r\nits way of thinking and its working methods, inherited\r\nfrom the period of the cold war.\r\nIf the Security Council continues, as it has in the\r\npast, to deal with matters in a biased manner, without\r\ntaking into account the views of the parties concerned and\r\nby persistently maintaining informal consultations as its\r\nmain working method under the pretext of ensuring\r\nefficiency in the Council’s work, no one can expect\r\npositive results. Rather, this will fuel confrontation among\r\nthe parties concerned, thus further aggravating disputes.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nThe activities of the United Nations for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security should be\r\nundertaken in a way that will reflect the views of the\r\ninternational community; and the views of the international\r\ncommunity should be formed in a democratized and open\r\nforum on the basis of the principle of impartiality, not in an\r\nundemocratic and closed Security Council. To this end, the\r\nparties concerned should be allowed to participate in\r\ninformal consultations, their views should be respected and\r\nthe process should be made public.\r\nWe oppose the current working method of the Security\r\nCouncil by which, through informal consultations, certain\r\nbig Powers are depicted as defenders of the peace and weak\r\ncountries are depicted as breakers of the peace. This was\r\nmanifested recently by the fact that Japan, which is\r\nobsessed with groundlessly finding fault with us, abused the\r\nSecurity Council so as to slander my country unjustifiably.\r\nJapan brought the issue of our satellite launch to the\r\nattention of the Security Council. Given its nature, that\r\nissue is not one that should be discussed in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn this regard, we cannot but call into question, first,\r\nthat the Security Council took up the issue of our satellite\r\nlaunch, even though there is no doubt that it was not a\r\nmatter to be dealt with by the Security Council, and,\r\nsecondly, that the Security Council issued the so-called\r\npress statement after discussing the issue in a private room,\r\nby a trick of Japan, and then described it as though it were\r\nthe view of the international community.\r\nThis clearly shows how impartiality is being ignored,\r\nhow the view of the international community is being\r\nfabricated in a closed setting of the Security Council and\r\nhow the Council is being abused by certain countries for\r\ntheir own political purposes instead of fulfilling its mission\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIf the Security Council is to ensure impartiality in its\r\nactivities, it is also important for it to draw appropriate\r\nlessons from its past serious wrongdoings resulting from\r\nabuses committed by certain big Powers for their own\r\npurposes and to take corrective measures in conformity\r\nwith today’s changed situation.\r\nAs is well known, in 1950, the United States illegally\r\nbrought the Korean question to the Security Council for\r\ndiscussion, without our being present, and forcibly\r\nengineered the adoption of a resolution in contravention of\r\nArticle 27, paragraph 3, of the United Nations Charter. This\r\nled to the abuse of the name of the United Nations by the\r\nUnited States and its intervention in the Korean war. Even\r\ntoday, the United States is attempting to justify the\r\npresence of its troops in South Korea.\r\nWe cannot remain indifferent to the abuse of the\r\nname of the United Nations by the United States in order\r\nto use its armed forces and achieve its military strategy.\r\nWe believe that the Security Council should take effective\r\nmeasures to rectify this kind of past wrongdoing.\r\nAt its thirtieth session, in 1975, the General\r\nAssembly adopted resolution 3390 B, calling for the\r\ndissolution of the United Nations Command in South\r\nKorea on the basis of recognition of the urgent need to\r\ntake new, decisive measures for terminating foreign\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of Korea in order to\r\nguarantee a durable peace and accelerate its independent\r\nand peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula.\r\nIn line with this resolution, we have been making\r\ncontinuous efforts to put an end to the abuse of the name\r\nof the United Nations by the United States. In April 1994,\r\nwe advanced a proposal to hold negotiations between the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United\r\nStates on replacing the old armistice system with a peace\r\narrangement and, in February 1996, made a proposal to\r\nconclude an interim agreement between the two countries\r\nuntil the signing of a peace agreement and to establish a\r\njoint military mechanism for implementing that\r\nagreement.\r\nHowever, the United States, failing to respond\r\npositively to the United Nations resolution and our peace-\r\nloving proposals, is still camouflaging the United States\r\ncommand in South Korea as the United Nations\r\nCommand, in order to deceive the world and distort the\r\ntruth, as if the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nand the Member States of the United Nations had\r\nbelligerent relations.\r\nThis abnormal situation has lasted for nearly half a\r\ncentury. Nevertheless, the Security Council has taken no\r\nmeasures yet to resolve the situation. This indicates that,\r\ndespite the changed international situation, the Security\r\nCouncil is still under the influence of the United States\r\nand certain other big Powers, which has the negative\r\neffect of putting its credibility in question.\r\nThe Member States of the United Nations should not\r\nturn away from the current situation in the Security\r\nCouncil, but should pay due attention to enabling it to\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nmake a substantial and effective contribution to peace and\r\nsecurity by democratizing it and ensuring its impartiality.\r\nMr. Shen Guofang (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): The Chinese delegation wishes to thank the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, Ambassador\r\nGreenstock, for submitting this annual report to the General\r\nAssembly. The report has duly reflected the Council’s work\r\nin the year from mid-1997 to mid-1998.\r\nThe international situation is undergoing profound\r\nchanges at the turn of the century. It has become the\r\ncommon understanding and shared aspiration of all Member\r\nStates of the Organization to maintain lasting peace, create\r\na secure environment for development and establish a just\r\nand stable world political order. According to the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, the Security Council, as an important\r\norgan of the United Nations, shoulders major responsibility\r\nfor the maintenance of world peace and security. In\r\ncarrying out its duties, the Council should listen to the\r\nviews of the vast number of Member States so that its\r\nactions will fully and truly reflect the will of the entire\r\nmembership of the Organization. In this light, the Chinese\r\ndelegation would like to make the following observations\r\non the work of the Council.\r\nFirst, the functions and role of the Council as laid out\r\nin the Charter should be further strengthened. Practices over\r\nthe past year have shown that the Council is irreplaceable\r\nin the leading role of maintaining world peace and security.\r\nWe believe that the Council should follow strictly the\r\nstipulations of the Charter and act in accordance with the\r\nwill of the majority of Member States in its work. Only by\r\nso doing can it retain its authority.\r\nSecondly, the United Nations should enhance and\r\nexpand its cooperation with regional organizations in\r\nmaintaining world peace and security. The United Nations\r\nhas had fruitful cooperation with relevant regional\r\norganizations in Africa and Central Asia over the past year.\r\nChina is in favour of regional organizations playing a\r\nconstructive role, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter, and it calls on the United Nations system to\r\nprovide meaningful support to regional organizations, such\r\nas the Organization of African Unity (OAU), that are in\r\nneed of necessary funds and technical expertise.\r\nAt the same time, we maintain that any multinational\r\nmilitary operation carried out with the authorization of the\r\nCouncil should strictly regulate its activities according to\r\nrelevant provisions and should standardize the mechanism\r\nof fulfilling its obligations to the Council, reporting to the\r\nCouncil and following the political guidance of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThirdly, over the past year the Council has been\r\nmore, rather than less, involved in the internal conflicts of\r\nsome countries. We are of the view that in dealing with\r\nthese important and complicated issues, the Council\r\nshould strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter, act upon the consent or request of countries\r\ninvolved and make the utmost effort to help resolve the\r\nconflict through peaceful means. We are not in favour of\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of a country in the\r\nname of alleviating humanitarian crises, or the use of\r\nmilitary threat or intervention with wilful invocation of\r\nChapter VII of the Charter.\r\nIn this connection, we are also opposed to placing all\r\nthe problems of conflict areas on the agenda of the\r\nCouncil. This does not conform to the principles guiding\r\nthe division of work among the various organs of the\r\nUnited Nations; nor does it facilitate the effective\r\nfunctioning of other United Nations organs, especially the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This practice may also sometimes\r\noverwhelm the priority issues before the Council and\r\naffect the Council’s effective functioning.\r\nFourthly, concerning the question of sanctions, we\r\nare of the view that wilful and frequent resort to sanctions\r\nwill not help resolve conflicts or disputes. On the\r\ncontrary, it will only further complicate a matter, inflict\r\nsuffering on the people of the country under sanction and\r\ncause economic difficulties or losses to third countries\r\nthat have to observe the regime. There have already been\r\ncases like this. Once again we call for early\r\nimplementation of the relevant principles set forth in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/242. We maintain that\r\nwhen sanctions are unavoidable, the specific target, scope\r\nand duration should be clearly defined, and sufficient\r\nconsideration should be given to humanitarian concerns.\r\nWe do not favour the current situation, where it is all too\r\neasy to impose sanctions but difficult to lift them.\r\nFifthly, the importance that the Council is requested\r\nto attach to African issues must be translated into\r\nconcrete deeds. African conflicts remained very much on\r\nthe agenda of the work of the Council last year. The\r\nprolonged turmoil on the African continent has evolved\r\nagainst a profound historical background and is the result\r\nof various complex internal and external factors. China\r\nhas all along been of the view that the Council should\r\nconsider seriously the legitimate demands of African\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 40th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\ncountries and respond positively to their appeals, and that\r\nit should give effective support and coordination to the\r\nefforts of African countries and regional organizations in\r\nsolving the problems of Africa.\r\nWe are pleased that for two consecutive years the\r\nCouncil has held meetings at the level of foreign ministers\r\nexclusively to discuss the problems of Africa. We hope that\r\nCouncil discussions on the African issue, which have been\r\nelevated with regard to the level of participants, will also\r\ngo deeper on substantive issues, with a view to finding an\r\neffective way to help accommodate the real concerns of\r\nAfrican countries and promote lasting stability and\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nThe Council acts upon the common will of Member\r\nStates. In order to make it easier for Member States in\r\ngeneral to gain more comprehensive acquaintance with the\r\nCouncil’s work, the Council has worked tirelessly in recent\r\nyears, in response to General Assembly resolution 51/193,\r\nto improve its working methods, including the way in\r\nwhich it drafts its report. As was pointed out earlier by the\r\nPresident of the Council, further improvement has been\r\nmade on the basis of past experience in the way the present\r\nannual report on the work of the Council was drafted. In\r\nparticular, the report now contains monthly assessments of\r\nthe Council’s work written by the successive Presidents\r\nafter consultation with other members of the Council. We\r\nhope that these measures will help further improve the\r\ntransparency and the effectiveness of the Council’s work.\r\nChina is in favour of continued efforts to improve\r\nthe Council’s work so that the Council will be able better\r\nand more accurately to reflect the will of Member States,\r\nand to carry out the tasks set out in the Charter more\r\neffectively by drawing on past experiences and lessons\r\nand by pooling the wisdom of Member States in general.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nConcerning agenda item 20, entitled “Strengthening of the\r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance\r\nof the United Nations, including special economic\r\nassistance”, I have requested the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Denmark to the United Nations,\r\nMr. Jørgen Bøjer, to coordinate the informal consultations\r\non the draft resolutions under that agenda item, and he\r\nhas graciously accepted.\r\nMay I request those delegations intending to submit\r\ndraft resolutions under agenda item 20 to do so as early\r\nas possible in order to allow time, if need be, for\r\nnegotiations with a view to reaching consensus on the\r\ndraft resolutions.\r\nAnnouncements\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\n1998 United Nations Pledging Conference for\r\nDevelopment Activities will be held on Wednesday,\r\n4 November, and Thursday, 5 November, in the morning.\r\nThe announcement of voluntary contributions to the\r\n1999 programme of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees will take place on Friday, 13\r\nNovember, in the morning.\r\nThe announcement of voluntary contributions to the\r\n1999 programmes of the United Nations Relief and\r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\r\nwill take place on Thursday, 3 December, in the morning.\r\nMembers are requested to consult the Journal for the\r\nannouncements on these activities for further details.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
