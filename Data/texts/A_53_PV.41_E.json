(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/53/2)\r\nMr. Sharma (India): Towards the turn of the century,\r\na famous lawyer known for the length of his arguments was\r\nonce told by a judge, “I have listened very carefully to your\r\npresentation, and I must say, I am none the wiser”, to\r\nwhich the lawyer replied, “None the wiser, possibly, my\r\nlord, but certainly better informed.” The Security Council’s\r\nannual reports to the General Assembly seem to be drafted\r\nin the same spirit, except that by looking at a compilation\r\nof Council documents which we have seen individually as\r\nthey were issued over the year, we are not even better\r\ninformed.\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, which conferred on the\r\nSecurity Council primary responsibility for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security on behalf of the full\r\nmembership of the United Nations, also stipulated that the\r\nCouncil should submit annual and, when necessary, special\r\nreports to the General Assembly for its consideration. The\r\nintent of the Charter is quite clear. The Council has been\r\ndelegated responsibilities, and it is expected that it should\r\ngive a full accounting of its work to the membership from\r\nwhich it receives its powers. That has never happened, but\r\nit is more than ever necessary that the letter and spirit of\r\nthe Charter should be respected in the Council’s reports.\r\nTwo years ago, at the initiative of members of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, the General Assembly at its fifty-first\r\nsession adopted resolution 51/193, which encouraged the\r\nSecurity Council to provide a substantive, analytical and\r\nmaterial account of its work. It included an indicative list\r\nof what the general membership would wish to see\r\nincluded in the Council’s reports.\r\nUnfortunately, the Council continues to fall short of\r\nthe wishes of the General Assembly. What we still have\r\nin its report is merely a listing of what the Council has\r\ndone or said on a number of issues. What the general\r\nmembership would have expected, in addition to the\r\nmeasures indicated in resolution 51/193, is a report that\r\nprovided, for example, an objective assessment of the\r\nextent to which the Council’s activity or decisions had\r\nbeen helpful regarding the issues before the Council, and\r\nthe Council’s assessment of its own work.\r\nIn the absence of such an evaluation, we must\r\nperforce comment on the various sections in the report\r\nonly on the basis of the limited information that it\r\nprovides. We note that over the last year the Council has\r\ntried to broaden its horizons. On the one hand, a whole\r\nnew doctrine is being built up of the wider implications\r\nof security in the post-millennial world. Economic\r\ndeprivations, trade disputes, environmental degradation\r\nand large-scale human rights violations, to name only a\r\nfew, are all seen as threats in a seamless weave of global\r\nsecurity. And, it is argued, the Security Council should\r\nhave a role in all of these. Others argue that, in the field\r\nof disarmament, the Council must monitor compliance\r\nwith multilateral treaties. A third argument is that the\r\nCouncil must have a role in any international system of\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\ncriminal justice. Though there is no intergovernmental\r\nagreement on these concepts, they have stretched the canvas\r\nof Security Council action well beyond anything envisaged\r\nfor it in the Charter. This year, for instance, the Council\r\nheld a meeting to consider issues related to humanitarian\r\nassistance, not a traditional concern of the Security Council,\r\nand not an area in which the collective experience of the\r\npermanent members would have provided any great\r\ninsights.\r\nHowever, it is apparent from the report that, despite\r\nclaims and arguments that the concept of security is now\r\nmuch wider than it was 50 years ago, the Council still\r\nmostly addresses problems that are properly within its\r\nmandate as defined in the Charter. It is understood that\r\nsecurity has a wider dimension, but it does not follow from\r\nthis that the Security Council’s role should be widened to\r\npermit it a say in questions of economic or social security.\r\nWe would expect the Security Council to continue to\r\nrestrict itself only to international peace and security, as\r\ndefined and understood in the Charter.\r\nIt is also interesting that, despite the lip service that is\r\npaid to the wider concept of security, the budget of the\r\nUnited Nations still does not reflect this. Over the last few\r\nbienniums, when the United Nations budget has been held\r\nto zero real growth, it was reasonable to expect that, if\r\neconomic and social issues were given higher priority, more\r\nresources would have been channelled towards them.\r\nHowever, the percentage of the budget earmarked for the\r\nSecurity Council has been preserved with the utmost care,\r\nnot because it was addressing the wider issues of security,\r\nbut because it continues to retain a privileged position even\r\nin the allocation of scarce resources. All the more reason,\r\ntherefore, why the general membership should ask if the\r\nSecurity Council is giving it value for money.\r\nIt would be difficult to agree that it is. On three issues\r\nwhere the Council has stretched its mandate, the report says\r\nvery little. As regards Iraq, the international community\r\nagrees that mandatory resolutions adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil must be implemented. However, the expansion of\r\nthe role of the Council in running what is described as the\r\noil-for-food programme is quite without precedent. Without\r\nany expertise in the matter, or indeed a mandate, the\r\nSecurity Council is in effect deciding what the needs of\r\nIraq are; the wishes and economic priorities of the\r\nGovernment are almost secondary. This is an extraordinary\r\ndevelopment, very little debated.\r\nThe Council has had several meetings on Africa. This\r\nin itself may have been helpful in drawing attention to\r\nproblems long neglected. But what has the Council\r\nachieved? It has set up six working groups, but there is\r\nvery little to indicate that these have, or will, produce\r\nanything substantive.\r\nThe two ad hoc Tribunals which the Council has set\r\nup were, in our consistent view, not within its powers to\r\nestablish. Nevertheless, they exist, though it makes us\r\nuncomfortable that two judicial bodies should be set up\r\nand be described as subsidiary organs of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nHowever, what is even more regrettable are two\r\noffshoots of this decision.First, in a letter written by the\r\njudges of the International Court of Justice to the\r\nSecretary-General, the Court notes that it has an annual\r\nbudget of approximately $11 million, while the 1997\r\nbudget of the International Tribunal for the former\r\nYugoslavia stands at $70 million. The International Court\r\nof Justice has expressed its regret that it and the ad hoc\r\nTribunals do not receive comparable treatment. This is\r\ngrossly anomalous and needs correction. A Charter body\r\nshould not suffer in comparison with those set up,\r\nthrough decisions of dubious legality, by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe other unfortunate offshoot, though of course not\r\nreflected in the report of the Council, was the pressure\r\nbrought to bear to ensure that the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court gave a continuing role to the\r\nSecurity Council. In setting up the ad hoc Tribunals,\r\nwhich under the Charter it had no power to do, the\r\nSecurity Council argued that the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security in the former Yugoslavia\r\nand in Rwanda made it essential to set them up. In the\r\nnegotiations on the Statute of the International Criminal\r\nCourt, it was argued that the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security might sometimes make it necessary for\r\nthe Court not to act, if the Security Council so decided.\r\nThese arguments contradict each other; neither is tenable\r\nas a basis to give the Security Council a role in the\r\nadministration of international law.\r\nI will turn now to chapter 24 of the report. This\r\nchapter is one of those under part I of the report, entitled\r\n“Questions considered by the Security Council under its\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security”. It is interesting that under this section the\r\nCouncil should again have had to have a separate chapter\r\non “The responsibility of the Security Council in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security”. This, of\r\ncourse, was the rubric and the excuse under which the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nCouncil took upon itself the right to pronounce itself on the\r\nnuclear tests in South Asia. Is one to believe that in\r\naddressing the issues listed in the other 23 chapters in this\r\nsection the Council was not acting to maintain international\r\npeace and security?\r\nWhen the Council took up its consideration of this\r\nissue, I sent a letter to the President of the Council, on the\r\ninstructions of my Government, asking for clarifications on\r\nwhy the Council thought it necessary to meet on our\r\nnuclear tests. This letter is listed among those that the\r\nCouncil received, but my Government still has not received\r\nthe courtesy of any response, let alone a satisfactory\r\nresponse, from the Council. The questions I raised about\r\nthe draft resolution in my letter remain just as valid about\r\nthe version adopted. They are fundamental questions, which\r\nmust concern the wider membership, about the way the\r\nCouncil functions, and I shall recall some of them.\r\nIf the Security Council assumes a role in disarmament,\r\ncan it continue to ignore the overwhelming demand for\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons, which has been repeatedly\r\nendorsed by the General Assembly? Will the Council\r\nhenceforth engage itself in matters relating to nuclear\r\ndisarmament?\r\nIf indeed the Charter of the United Nations envisaged\r\nany role for the Security Council on non-proliferation\r\nissues, which is doubtful, why did it not act on the\r\nproliferation of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons since\r\nthe United Nations was established? Is the Security\r\nCouncil’s concern on matters of proliferation limited to\r\nhorizontal proliferation alone? Is the continued retention of\r\nnuclear weapons by the nuclear-weapon States not\r\nconsidered a proliferation risk that threatens international\r\npeace and security?\r\nIf nuclear tests are a threat to non-proliferation and\r\ndisarmament, or if the imputation is that tests raise tensions,\r\nwhy did the Council not take cognizance of the more than\r\n2,000 tests carried out over the last 50 years, including as\r\nrecently as 1996?\r\nOn what basis can the Council call on a country which\r\nhas undertaken no legal commitment to do so to stop\r\nnuclear weapon development programmes, when this\r\nprocess continues in other countries without the Council\r\ntaking any notice?\r\nCan the Council call on a country not to develop\r\nballistic missiles when it has made no such call on others,\r\nincluding those who have several thousand of these\r\nweapons in their arsenals and continue to produce and\r\ndevelop them? The United Nations has not even\r\nconsidered the negotiation of a treaty to ban the\r\ndevelopment or production of ballistic missiles.\r\nOn what basis did the Council limit its concern on\r\nnuclear weapons to an arbitrarily defined geographical\r\nsubregion, when nuclear weapons by definition have a\r\nglobal reach and impact, and when the security concerns\r\nof India extend well beyond that subregion? Non-\r\nproliferation is a global issue and cannot be segmented\r\naccording to political preferences.\r\nThe Security Council acts on behalf of the full\r\nmembership of the United Nations. Neither of the treaties\r\nmentioned in the draft resolution — the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) —\r\nenjoys universal adherence among the United Nations\r\nmembership. Since several Member States of the United\r\nNations are not States parties to these treaties, on whose\r\nbehalf did the Security Council “reaffirm” its commitment\r\nto these Treaties?\r\nCan the Security Council urge any Member State of\r\nthe United Nations to become a party to any treaty\r\nwithout delay and without conditions? This is tantamount\r\nto coercion and a clear violation of the fundamental\r\nprinciple that a State must freely consent to be bound by\r\na treaty, a right protected by the law of treaties.\r\nOn what basis can the Secretary-General report to\r\nthe Council on the steps taken by the countries addressed\r\nby this resolution, when most of its provisions are ultra\r\nvires or at variance with international law and infringe on\r\nthe sovereign prerogatives of Member States?\r\nUnder Article 31 of the Charter,\r\n“Any Member of the United Nations which is\r\nnot a member of the Security Council may\r\nparticipate, without vote, in the discussion of any\r\nquestion brought before the Security Council\r\nwhenever the latter considers that the interests of\r\nthat Member are specially affected.”\r\nThe Council disregarded this Charter provision by\r\nnot giving India an opportunity to participate in the\r\ndiscussions on its draft on the nuclear tests in South Asia.\r\nThe general membership of the United Nations will note\r\nthis as one more instance of the Council acting in a\r\nmanner that was neither open nor transparent, a problem\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nthat has been repeatedly highlighted in the discussions in\r\nthe Open-Ended Working Group of the General Assembly\r\non Security Council reform.\r\nIt is this lack of transparency that gives rise to the\r\nbelief that the Council often acts not on behalf of the\r\ngeneral membership, as it must under the terms of the\r\nCharter, but to preserve privilege. The Non-Aligned\r\nMovement has consistently spoken on these reform aspects\r\nrelating to the Council’s activities. We also recall that in\r\nDecember 1997 the non-permanent members of the Council\r\nsubmitted a position paper which reflected a sense of\r\ndissatisfaction with the Council’s methods of operation and\r\nmade suggestions for reform. We have to correct the\r\nsituation in which the Council is perceived as oscillating\r\nbetween hasty action, leaving the developing world\r\ndissatisfied, or no action, making the developing world feel\r\nthat the Council is being indifferent because the interest of\r\nthe permanent members is not engaged.\r\nIn addition, while the Security Council assumes new\r\npowers and functions of dubious legality, we also see\r\ndisturbing attempts to bypass it or to ignore its role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security when this\r\nsuits powerful interests. Some States, including some\r\npermanent members, have questioned the need for the\r\nauthorization by the Council of peace enforcement by\r\nregional arrangements, so clearly stipulated in Article 53 of\r\nthe Charter; in the course of two recent crises, regarding\r\nIraq and Kosovo, it has been argued that a resolution of the\r\nCouncil authorizing military action was not required. In\r\nAfghanistan, despite the repeated appeals of its legitimate\r\nGovernment, the Council has done nothing to check foreign\r\nintervention, which has sought to overthrow the\r\nGovernment by armed force. These are developments that\r\nundermine the authority of the Council even further.\r\nThe report makes pro forma references to the situation\r\nin the Middle East, one of the issues where the Council has\r\nmarginalized itself. Several times in the recent past,\r\nincluding this year, special sessions of the General\r\nAssembly have been called to discuss this issue, which is\r\non the agenda of the Security Council, but on which the\r\nCouncil has been less than involved. These decisions of the\r\ngeneral membership reflect a deep dissatisfaction with the\r\ncurrent functioning of the Council. This situation should not\r\nbe allowed to drag on.\r\nThe Council’s annual report was not intended to\r\nconfirm the need for reform, but that is what it does. It is\r\nclear that the Council needs to be made more transparent\r\nand more representative of the general membership; the one\r\nobjective will probably depend on the other. We hope that\r\nthis report will provide one more spur for the process of\r\nexpansion and reform of the Security Council, which\r\nIndia, along with others, proposed five years ago, and\r\nwhich was carried by consensus in the General Assembly.\r\nMs. Ramiro Lopez (Philippines): I would like to\r\nthank the Security Council for its report and the President\r\nof the Council for presenting the report to us today.\r\nThe report of the Security Council is not only a stark\r\nand compelling historical record of the critical global\r\nevents during the period it covers; the report is also a\r\nfaithful record of the action and response of the Security\r\nCouncil to these events. But perhaps just as significantly,\r\nthe report is also a cogent and real link between the\r\nSecurity Council and those of us who sit in this\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn this regard, I welcome the sincere efforts of the\r\nCouncil to enhance the analytical nature of the report,\r\nsomething that many United Nations Member States have\r\nbeen asking for over the years. This effort has somewhat\r\nincreased the content of the report, but this is an increase\r\nthat is well justified. I must also mention at this point that\r\nthe efforts of the Council throughout the year to make its\r\nproceedings and the proceedings of its Committees more\r\ntransparent are welcome developments which we should\r\ncontinue to encourage.\r\nHowever, we would like to see more substantive\r\ninformation appear in the report, as called for in\r\nresolution 51/193, on the work of the Council’s subsidiary\r\nbodies, such as the Sanctions Committee — particularly\r\ninformation on the consultations of the whole undertaken\r\nprior to action by the Council on substantive issues within\r\nits mandate.\r\nEven as we, as an Organization, continue to debate\r\nthe issue of reforming the United Nations — a debate that\r\nthreatens to outlast us all — we must take every\r\nopportunity to enhance our work, which can be achieved\r\nthrough the positive interaction of the Assembly and the\r\nCouncil. This positive interaction would revitalize the\r\nAssembly’s role in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. For, while the Security Council is structured\r\nand primarily geared towards addressing actual threats to\r\npeace, the Assembly is quite suited to preventing conflict\r\nand creating the conditions for peace and progress and,\r\nindeed, many of us believe, has a central role to play in\r\nthe area of peace.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nWith this precisely in mind, we mandated that the\r\nPresident of the Assembly should, based on his assessment\r\nof the debate on this report, hold informal consultations to\r\ndiscuss any action that should be taken by the Assembly\r\nbased on this report. An indispensable requirement for such\r\nconsultations, and in fact for the meaningful consideration\r\nof any action by the Assembly, is the submission of a\r\nreport that is more substantive and analytical.\r\nWe look forward to these consultations, confident that\r\neach and every member of this Assembly, and this\r\nAssembly as a collective body, have much to contribute in\r\nour common quest for peace.\r\nMs. Wensley (Australia): Australia attaches\r\nconsiderable importance to this agenda item. As the organ\r\nof the United Nations with primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\r\nSecurity Council plays a key role which directly affects the\r\ninterests of all Member States. Its report to the General\r\nAssembly is one very important means — but, I emphasize,\r\nonly one — available to the Council to keep the wider\r\nmembership informed of the decisions it has taken which\r\nimpact on those interests.\r\nComment on the report provides all Member States\r\nwith the opportunity to reflect upon the relationship\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council\r\nand on how that relationship can be strengthened. It also\r\nenables us to recognize and to reaffirm the central role the\r\nCouncil plays.\r\nThe report before us is, in Australia’s view, a useful\r\nreference document which summarizes the extensive work\r\ncarried out by the Security Council over the last year.\r\nReading it, there is no denying the vital contribution the\r\nCouncil has made to the maintenance of peace and security\r\nand there is no denying that it will continue to play a\r\npivotal role.\r\nI take this opportunity to place on record the\r\nappreciation of the Australian Government to all the\r\nmembers of the Council, permanent and non-permanent, for\r\nthe contributions they have made. To the newly elected\r\nnon-permanent members which will assume their seats next\r\nyear, I reiterate Australia’s congratulations on their election\r\nand pledge our full support for the task ahead of them,\r\nincluding, I would suggest, responding in both intellectual\r\nand practical ways to the issues being raised in the debate\r\non this report — a debate which, I must say, my delegation\r\nis finding very interesting and useful. I hope, to use\r\nAmbassador Sharma’s introductory language, that if we, the\r\nGeneral Assembly members, are better informed by the\r\nreport, then they, the members of the Security Council,\r\nmay be the wiser for this discussion.\r\nLife as a non-member of the Security Council can at\r\ntimes be very frustrating. Day to day, we know that\r\nconsultations are taking place amongst the members of\r\nthe Council on issues crucial to global peace and security.\r\nSometimes we have a very direct and material interest in\r\nthe issues under discussion; at other times, our own direct\r\nsecurity concerns may be less engaged, but our broader\r\ninterests as members of the community of nations are\r\nnonetheless affected.\r\nInvariably, the consultations amongst Council\r\nmembers take place behind closed doors. Resolutions and\r\nstatements are negotiated and decisions taken informally\r\nwithout reference to the wider membership and are often\r\ncloaked in a shroud of secrecy. There are, sometimes,\r\ngood reasons for this. The issues are often such that both\r\nconfidentiality and speed of decision-making are crucial.\r\nBut at the same time, the process generates frustrations\r\nand tensions for non-members, who are not only excluded\r\nfrom the decision-making process, but also often denied\r\naccess to timely and comprehensive information about\r\nhow those decisions are reached.\r\nThese are, of course, not new concerns. As we have\r\njust been reminded by the representative of the\r\nPhilippines, they have long been the subject of discussion.\r\nThe call for greater transparency and openness in the\r\nwork of the Security Council can be traced back many\r\nyears.\r\nSome important progress has been made in this time.\r\nThe annual report of the Council has undergone numerous\r\nchanges in format, most recently this year. We welcome\r\nthese changes, which we believe make the report a more\r\nuseful reference document and a more useful analytical\r\ntool.\r\nMore important are reforms that have been\r\nintroduced to keep the wider membership informed of\r\nissues before the Council as they happen. In these days of\r\ninstant telecommunications and blanket media coverage of\r\nany significant international event, the need for\r\ninformation about the activities of the Council becomes\r\nmore imperative. Contrary to the normal laws of supply\r\nand demand, the more we hear, the more we need to\r\nknow. Watching an event unfold on CNN does not satisfy\r\nour Governments’ appetite for information; it simply\r\nsharpens it.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nSurely, the Members of this Organization that are not\r\nmembers of the Security Council deserve better access to\r\ninformation about the Council’s activities than the media.\r\nWe must have information that is both more timely and\r\nmore comprehensive. We must be able to brief our\r\nGovernments on these activities, because they must make\r\ninformed and timely policy decisions and they, too, face\r\npressures from the media.\r\nThe briefings given to non-members by the President\r\nof the Council following informal meetings are a most\r\nimportant innovation. While my delegation has at times felt\r\nuncomfortable waiting for media conferences to conclude\r\nbefore we and other non-members are briefed — and the\r\nsymbolism of this is obvious— we are nonetheless\r\nappreciative of the effort that is being made to keep us\r\ninformed. To this end, I would like to thank those Council\r\nmembers that have made a particular effort to give full and\r\ndetailed briefings during their tenure of the presidency.\r\nWe believe strongly that these briefings must continue,\r\nnot as an optional or discretionary activity of the\r\npresidency, but as a central part of the rights and\r\nresponsibilities that members assume when they take their\r\nseats in the Council. It is equally important that all\r\nmembers remain accessible to non-members and respond\r\npromptly to requests for information. This holds for both\r\npermanent and non-permanent members, although it could\r\nperhaps be argued that the responsibility of the five\r\npermanent members is even greater, as they are the keepers\r\nof the Council’s institutional memory. For its part, Australia\r\nwill increasingly look at how members discharge or\r\npropose to discharge their responsibility towards non-\r\nmembers in determining our support for candidatures for\r\nnon-permanent seats.\r\nOther improvements have been made in the Council’s\r\nworking methods to assist openness and transparency. The\r\nmonthly assessments that are offered by each outgoing\r\nPresident, which are included as an annex to this year’s\r\nreport, are interesting, but could be circulated much more\r\nusefully at the end of each month. The Council’s decision\r\nin April this year to circulate the tentative forecast and\r\nschedule of work is another welcome decision.\r\nIt is interesting to note that many of these\r\nimprovements had their genesis in the discussions in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council reform,\r\nand we are pleased that the Council has adopted them. The\r\nWorking Group’s report, which will be taken up in a later\r\nplenary meeting under another agenda item, offers a\r\nnumber of further suggestions for improving the\r\ntransparency and openness of the Council. They warrant\r\nvery careful consideration.\r\nThe General Assembly has an important role to play\r\nin reminding the Security Council of its responsibility to\r\nkeep the wider United Nations membership informed of\r\nits activities. Transparency is an important principle, as\r\nwe have heard over and over again in today’s debate, but\r\nthe issue is more than simply one of principle. Keeping\r\nnon-members informed is crucial to maintaining their\r\nsupport. Over time, any erosion of support will inevitably\r\nhave an impact on the standing of the Council and the\r\ncredibility of its decisions. This in turn, I suggest, would\r\nhave wider repercussions in terms of the overall\r\ncredibility and influence of the United Nations itself.\r\nI reiterate that the report of the Security Council that\r\nwe are dealing with today is a good document. It is a\r\nvaluable step in the direction of greater transparency and\r\nopenness in the work of the Council, but it is only one\r\nsmall step. We look forward to many more as part of the\r\nprocess of reform, which remains a fundamental\r\npreoccupation of my Government.\r\nMr. Fowler (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nAs this is the first time that I have taken the floor under\r\nyour presidency, Sir, allow me to express my pleasure at\r\nseeing you presiding over our deliberations. I am certain\r\nthat under your expert guidance the work of the General\r\nAssembly this year will be profitable and productive.\r\nThe debate on the report of the Security Council is\r\none of the most important items on the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly because, under the terms of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, the relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly is unique.\r\nNowhere else in the Charter do the Member States entrust\r\na select few of their number with the responsibility for\r\ndecision-making in what is arguably the most vital area of\r\nour collective activity: the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. In no other area do all the States\r\nmembers of the General Assembly agree to carry out the\r\ndecisions made by those few.\r\nThe relationship between the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council took shape in the\r\nwake of the global conflicts that characterized the first\r\nhalf of this century, and we can congratulate ourselves\r\nthat the Council’s work on behalf of all of the Member\r\nStates has been one of the main bulwarks against\r\nconfrontation on a global scale. The Council has\r\nmanaged, with varying degrees of success, to contain\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nseveral of the all too numerous threats to international\r\npeace and security, which, although less extensive and more\r\nlimited, have characterized the second half of the twentieth\r\ncentury. However, the Security Council is in danger of\r\nbeing unable to meet the new challenges to peace and\r\nsecurity in the coming millennium. As we are well aware,\r\nthese challenges relate more to conflicts within States than\r\nto conflicts between States, conflicts that increasingly target\r\ncivilian populations.\r\nThe danger stems from two negative and closely\r\nrelated trends: first, the inability of the Security Council to\r\nachieve swift consensus on missions seeking to resolve\r\nsome of the world’s most worrying problems; and secondly,\r\nthe Draconian reduction in resources for peacekeeping, both\r\nhuman and financial — resources that are an indispensable\r\ncondition for an effective Council. Both trends are serious\r\nthreats to the Council’s relevance and both are reversible,\r\ngiven the requisite will and commitment.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThree trends appear to us to emerge from the report of\r\nthe Security Council for the period from 16 June 1997 to\r\n15 June 1998 which we believe are likely to have the\r\ngreatest influence on the Security Council’s future\r\neffectiveness. The first is what may be the beginning of a\r\nmove from the closed, secretive, behind the scenes\r\ndeliberations and decision-making of the Council in favour\r\nof a more open and transparent process. Still more can be\r\ndone to ensure that Member States not currently members\r\nof the Council remain well seized of the Council’s\r\nactivities, and that Member States involved in and affected\r\nby matters before the Council are able to exercise their\r\nCharter rights, especially under Articles 31 and 32.\r\nEvidence of such an evolution can be found in the\r\npresidential assessments and summaries annexed as part of\r\nthe report, as well as the detailed briefings provided by\r\nsuccessive Security Council presidencies immediately\r\nfollowing the Council’s deliberations. It is Canada’s hope\r\nthat this practice will continue and become enshrined as a\r\npart of a President’s duty. Another indication of this happy\r\ntrend is the willingness of some Council Presidents to hold\r\nopen debates on issues on which Member States not\r\ncurrently members of the Council wish to speak. In this\r\nregard, I note with regret that while the views of non-\r\nCouncil members are sometimes heard immediately prior to\r\nthe Council taking a formal decision, this is not the same\r\nas the Council actually considering the views of Member\r\nStates before taking such a decision.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group on Security\r\nCouncil reform has made some progress in nearing\r\ngeneral agreement on the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council, particularly considering the need for\r\ntransparency of the Council’s work as well as its\r\ndecision-making process, including, of course, work on\r\nthe curtailment of the veto. The advances made in these\r\ndiscussions are somewhat encouraging. Unfortunately, the\r\nsame cannot be said of the Working Group’s efforts to\r\nfind general agreement on the thorny matter of expansion.\r\nA second and positive trend is the somewhat greater\r\nwillingness of the Council to engage in broader thematic\r\ndebates that expand the Security Council’s capacity to\r\ndeal with modern challenges to peace and security. I refer\r\nparticularly to debates such as those concerning\r\nlandmines, child soldiers, the protection of humanitarian\r\nassistance workers and the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe situation in Africa. In regard to the last of these, I\r\nwish to express Canada’s admiration for the successful\r\nfollow-up process in the form of the ad hoc Working\r\nGroup of the Security Council established pursuant to\r\nresolution 1170 (1998) and its six thematic subgroups.\r\nThese debates are helping the Council to examine\r\nand re-examine traditional interpretations of its mandate\r\nin order to address emerging threats which are likely to\r\nhave an impact on our collective security in the next\r\ncentury. The addition of peace-building to the Council’s\r\nrange of responses is also welcome, as it stands to come\r\nto grips with the root causes of conflict and should help\r\nto allow consideration by the Council of broad threats to\r\nhuman security. Considerations of peace-building will,\r\nhowever, further exacerbate the continuing resource crisis\r\nwith which the Council is so hobbled.\r\nThe third trend is not a positive one. I refer to the\r\nerosion of the credibility of the Council. The most\r\nworrisome example of this trend is the decision by the\r\nheads of State or Government of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, at their summit meeting this June in\r\nBurkina Faso, no longer to be bound by Security Council-\r\nimposed sanctions — in this case, those levied against\r\nLibya. This action is a troubling precedent which is, of\r\ncourse, contrary to the clear Charter obligations of all\r\nMember States of the United Nations to carry out the\r\ndecisions of the Security Council. It is clear, however,\r\nthat leadership requires “followership” and that the\r\nCouncil can only lead with the continuing consent of the\r\nmembership — a consent which must be continually won\r\nand nurtured.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nCanada believes that such questioning is reversible.\r\nThe Security Council must become more willing to become\r\ninvolved, and more consistent in both how and when it\r\nbecomes involved, in issues that pose a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. It must also, however,\r\nbecome more sensitive to the collateral humanitarian impact\r\nof sanctions. Further, the Council belongs to all of us. It\r\ncannot be allowed to focus on solving the problems of one\r\nregion while remaining indifferent to those of others.\r\nAnother step that would aid in arresting the erosion of\r\nthe Council’s authority is to narrow the distinction between\r\nelected and permanent members of the Council. Such a\r\nmove could only raise the credibility of the Council and\r\nthus result in greater effectiveness in the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council decisions.\r\nWe believe that the General Assembly must continue\r\nto pay close attention to the work of the Security Council\r\nto ensure that in the coming century the Council, which\r\nmakes peace and security decisions on our behalf, evolves\r\nin the direction of more responsibility, more accountability\r\nand less impenetrability.\r\nMr. Konishi (Japan): As a member of the Security\r\nCouncil, my delegation wishes to associate itself with the\r\nstatement made by Ambassador Greenstock this morning in\r\nhis capacity as President of the Security Council for this\r\nmonth. We are fully supportive of all his assessments and\r\nwould simply like to add a few supplementary comments.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the consideration of this\r\nimportant matter in the General Assembly, as it will\r\nprovide an opportunity to reflect upon and carefully assess\r\nthe developments pertaining to international peace and\r\nsecurity which have taken place during the period from 16\r\nJune 1997 to 15 June 1998. But even more importantly, it\r\nwill provide us with the opportunity to consider the\r\nquestion of the Security Council’s relationship with, and\r\nresponsibility to, the wider membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to welcome the\r\nnumerous positive developments reflected in the format of\r\nthis year’s report. There are, in the view of my delegation,\r\ntwo major examples of improved transparency in the work\r\nof the Council which have been pursued during the period\r\nunder consideration. One is the inclusion in the addendum\r\nto the report of monthly assessments made by former\r\nPresidents, which offer an analytical perspective. Another\r\nis the diligent conduct of daily briefings by the presidency.\r\nThey are attended by an increasingly large number of non-\r\nCouncil Member States interested in acquiring timely\r\ninformation on deliberations in the informal consultations\r\nof the Council.\r\nAs the President of the Security Council in April of\r\nthis year, Japan, too, strove to improve transparency in\r\nthe work of the Council in both these aspects. These\r\nefforts are reflected in the report on pages 347 to 351.\r\nWe are pleased to see that the report faithfully\r\nincorporated improvements according to the blueprint\r\nprovided in the note by the President of the Security\r\nCouncil (S/1997/451) issued on 12 June 1997. My\r\ndelegation is hopeful that these improvements will further\r\nstrengthen the Council’s accountability to the wider\r\nmembership.\r\nIt goes without saying that improving transparency\r\nin the work of the Council is one of the many important\r\nelements in the greater task of enhancing the credibility\r\nand effectiveness of the Council and the United Nations\r\nas a whole. In the view of my delegation, however, the\r\nimproved transparency of the Council will have its true\r\nimpact felt only when the composition of the Council\r\nitself reflects the realities of the changing world. My\r\ndelegation would like to reaffirm its commitment to all\r\nthese efforts to further enhance the credibility of the\r\nCouncil, and the United Nations as a whole, so that it can\r\nbetter deal with the challenges that lie ahead.\r\nMr. Čalovski (The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): The delegation of the Republic of Macedonia\r\nwould like to congratulate the President of the Security\r\nCouncil, the Permanent Representative of the United\r\nKingdom, on his introduction of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly for the period 16 June\r\n1997 to 15 June 1998. We consider the Security Council’s\r\nreport in conjunction with the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization.\r\nWe are pleased with the informative and useful\r\npresentation by the Council President and with the format\r\nand the content of this year’s report. It is correct to say\r\nthat it represents an improvement in comparison with last\r\nyear’s report. It is clear that this year’s discussion in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council has influenced the Council to report to\r\nthe General Assembly more fully and comprehensively.\r\nIn the light of our stated position in favour of having a\r\nmore relevant General Assembly and more relevant\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nSecurity Council, we expect that next year’s report will\r\nreflect further improvement.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is mentioned in the report\r\nseveral times. I would like to take this opportunity to state\r\nthat cooperation between the Republic of Macedonia and\r\nthe Security Council has been satisfactory indeed. My\r\ndelegation has maintained excellent relations with all\r\nmembers of the Security Council, both elected and\r\npermanent. I would like to thank them for the cooperation\r\nthey have extended and for their support of the preventive\r\nmeasures that have helped the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity in our region.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Security Council\r\nseveral times deliberated on the question of the United\r\nNations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), which\r\nis stationed in my country, on our western and northern\r\nborders with Albania and with the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia. Twice, the Security Council decided to extend\r\nthe mandate of the Force. The success story of this one and\r\nonly preventive United Nations mission is now common\r\nknowledge in the Organization. It represents an important\r\ncontribution by the United Nations and by the Republic of\r\nMacedonia to the stability of the region. Given\r\ndevelopments in Albania and in Kosovo and Metohija, the\r\nimportance of the mission of UNPREDEP now and in the\r\nimmediate future has increased. The Republic of Macedonia\r\nwill continue to give its full support to the mission, and I\r\nam sure that the Security Council’s support will not be\r\nlacking.\r\nThe Security Council has become the centre of the\r\npolitical activities of the United Nations. It is the busiest\r\norgan of the Organization. Owing to its ability to act under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter, the Security Council is the most\r\npowerful political body in the sphere of international\r\nrelations. Owing to the veto power of its permanent\r\nmembers, the Security Council is the only undemocratic\r\nbody of our Organization. So there is no doubt as to why\r\nreform of the Security Council is, politically, the most\r\ndelicate undertaking of United Nations reform. For some\r\ntime in the future the present situation will not change.\r\nHowever, it is correct to state that the Security Council has\r\nendeavoured to improve its working methods and to\r\nbecome more transparent. That can be seen from the\r\npresent report. It is true that closed consultations and the\r\ndecisions taken at closed consultation meetings are the\r\nsubject of concern for many delegations. On the other hand,\r\nit is not correct to say that non-members of the Council\r\ncannot find out what is going on in the closed consultations\r\nroom or bring their views to the attention of the members\r\nof the Council. As far as my delegation is concerned, I\r\nam pleased to state that all members of the Council have\r\nbeen cooperative. We therefore have no complaints to\r\nmake. We would like to express satisfaction at the\r\ncooperation extended to us.\r\nThis is not the time to speak about the role of the\r\nSecurity Council or about the role of the General\r\nAssembly. We will have the chance to do that under other\r\nrelevant agenda items. Nevertheless, I would like to use\r\nthis opportunity to stress that there is an unquestionable\r\nneed to strengthen the role and the relevance of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in order to stop its diminishing\r\ninfluence in international political affairs. My delegation\r\nis in favour of a relevant Security Council and of a\r\nrelevant General Assembly. Close cooperation between\r\nthose United Nations organs is of paramount importance.\r\nIf both can act in a timely manner, with the full force of\r\nthe Charter and with the backing of Member States, the\r\ninternational community and, in particular, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the United Nations will\r\ndefinitely become the most relevant Organization for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and for\r\nthe strengthening of international cooperation.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French): In\r\nconformity with Article 24 (3) of the Charter, the Security\r\nCouncil has submitted its fifty-third report for\r\nconsideration by the General Assembly. Let me at the\r\noutset pay deserved tribute to the members of the Security\r\nCouncil for the quality, depth, and exhaustively analytical\r\nand balanced character of the report, which enables us\r\nclearly to see their commitment and their devotion in the\r\nservice of international peace and security: the primary\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council.\r\nIn reading the report, we note that a number of\r\npoints arise. The world situation continues to be\r\ndominated by numerous localized tensions and wars\r\nwhich pose a serious threat to the peace and stability of\r\nmany regions in spite of the unrelenting efforts of the\r\ninternational community, and more particularly of the\r\nSecurity Council, to find lasting political solutions. Here\r\nI would mention the lack of progress in the Middle East\r\npeace process, the ongoing civil war in Afghanistan, the\r\nescalating violence in Kosovo, the standoff in the Cyprus\r\npeace process and the many conflicts in Africa. All these\r\nsituations, which threaten international peace and security,\r\nare of grave concern to the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nThe Security Council, the guarantor of international\r\npeace and security, is well aware of this, and during the\r\nperiod under review devoted a great deal of time and\r\nenergy to limiting these dangers. In this context, I want to\r\nhighlight and to welcome the discrete but vigorous action\r\ntaken by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to achieve\r\nthe peaceful settlement of a number of serious crises.\r\nWe especially welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\ncourageous initiatives and diplomatic breakthroughs at the\r\nbeginning of the year during the tensions in the Persian\r\nGulf. My delegation believes that since some of these\r\ninitiatives are undertaken with the backing of the Security\r\nCouncil, it would also be important to continue to support\r\nthe credibility of the United Nations and the authority of its\r\nSecretary-General so that other actions he undertakes with\r\nStates to strengthen peace are respected by all.\r\nThe report of the Security Council gives top priority\r\nto the crises convulsing Africa, the continent that is\r\ncurrently experiencing the largest number of internal\r\nconflicts on the Council’s agenda. I am referring here to\r\nAngola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Western\r\nSahara and Sierra Leone. This unenviable situation led the\r\nSecurity Council to examine conditions for a concerted\r\ninternational effort to promote peace and stability in Africa\r\nduring a special meeting at the ministerial level on 25\r\nSeptember 1997.\r\nAt that meeting, the members of the Council asked the\r\nSecretary-General to submit a report on the sources of\r\nconflict in Africa and ways to prevent and ultimately\r\neliminate them, as well as to formulate recommendations on\r\nthe establishment of durable peace and economic\r\ndevelopment. In that valuable report, which was favourably\r\nreceived by our entire community of nations, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, having rightly pointed out the intrinsic relationship\r\nbetween peace and development, outlined the criteria,\r\nmeans and mechanisms that should be set up to ensure and\r\nsafeguard peace, a sine qua non condition for sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General gave rise to a vast\r\nupsurge of solidarity throughout the world. We should\r\nnevertheless remain vigilant and prudent for, as Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan himself has said,\r\n“it is in deeds rather than in declarations that the\r\ninternational community’s commitment to Africa will\r\nbe measured”. (A/52/871, para. 106)\r\nThese very sensible words remind us of the numerous\r\ndisappointed expectations and the frustrations experienced\r\nby Africa at crucial moments in its history.\r\nThe drama of Rwanda, Somalia and the Congo\r\n(Brazzaville) yesterday and of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo today are all real examples, experienced by\r\nAfricans, not of a lack of interest on the part of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community in the\r\ncrises of that continent, but of situations in which the\r\nhesitation and, often, the inaction of the Council gave rise\r\nto much frustration on the part of certain Member States.\r\nWith regard to the specific area of prevention, it\r\nshould be pointed out that much still remains to be done\r\nat the level of the United Nations system. When a\r\nsituation shows signs of becoming an acute crisis and\r\ncalls out for urgent measures to be taken or for a rapid\r\ndeployment of United Nations forces, it would be\r\nadvisable for United Nations organs, and particularly the\r\nSecurity Council, to react immediately to safeguard\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe are increasingly noticing the development of a\r\nfeeling that, because of its internal contradictions, the\r\nSecurity Council takes too long to react to critical\r\nsituations in Africa. At the same time, a trend is emerging\r\nbased on the firm conviction that in the face of the\r\nCouncil’s inertia Africa should try to look to itself to\r\nresolve its problems at either the regional or subregional\r\nlevels.\r\nMy delegation is of the opinion that regional and\r\nsubregional initiatives and efforts for the prevention and\r\nsettlement of conflicts must be encouraged whenever\r\npossible, but within the context of full cooperation\r\nbetween regional organizations and the international\r\ncommunity, in accordance with the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe crises in Africa concern not only Africa, but the\r\nentire international community. It is therefore in the\r\ninterest of peace and security that the Security Council\r\nshould increasingly help Africans in order to ensure that,\r\nin the face of these painful crises in Africa, States give\r\ngreater emphasis to a culture of preventing conflicts rather\r\nthan a policy of reacting to situations and crises that have\r\nalready led to much loss of human lives.\r\nIt is also appropriate to welcome the initiative taken\r\nlast January by the Government of Japan in organizing at\r\nTokyo a conference on preventive strategies. That\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nconference focused essentially on efforts that should be\r\nundertaken by the international community to strengthen the\r\npreventive warning capacities of States and international\r\norganizations in order to respond to the different stages in\r\nthe evolution of conflicts by specifically targeting the real\r\ncauses of conflicts and their exacerbation, the factors that\r\nlead to outbreaks of violence and those that are likely to\r\ncontribute to the preservation of peace after conflicts.\r\nA necessary revision of the Security Council’s modus\r\noperandi should be undertaken in order to ensure that this\r\ntrend towards inertia does not have grievous consequences\r\non the credibility and legitimacy of the Council. It must be\r\nstressed in this regard that there is already a large measure\r\nof consensus on such essential points as the Council’s\r\nmeetings and the participation of non-members, its\r\nprogramme of work and the informational meetings\r\nconvened by the President for countries that are not\r\nmembers of the Council. In this connection, the members\r\nof the Council have already grasped the full extent of the\r\nreform that must be undertaken to achieve a marked\r\nimprovement in the Council’s methods; and important\r\nmeasures in that direction have already been proposed.\r\nWhat remains to be done is to translate this impetus\r\ninto reality and to institutionalize it to endow the Council\r\nwith greater transparency and legitimacy. In so doing we\r\nshall be helping that important decision-making body at the\r\nheart of our system to ensure that its decisions are better\r\nunderstood and generally better supported by the Member\r\nStates of the Organization.\r\nMr. Fulci (Italy): First of all, allow me to congratulate\r\nthe Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom,\r\nAmbassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the current President\r\nof the Security Council, for his clear, comprehensive and\r\nthoughtful presentation of the Council’s annual report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish to extend my compliments\r\nto the Secretariat for its excellent work in preparing the\r\ndocument.\r\nItaly has constantly stressed, and wishes to underline\r\nonce again, the importance of the General Assembly’s\r\ndiscussion of the Security Council’s report. This report is\r\nan essential tool for ensuring effective coordination and\r\ninteraction between the Council and the General Assembly,\r\nin accordance with the relevant provisions of the United\r\nNations Charter, particularly its Article 15. Moreover, this\r\nyear’s report, which covers the period from 16 June 1997\r\nto 15 June 1998, deserves even greater attention, since for\r\nthe first time it was prepared taking into account the\r\nmeasures approved by the Council in June 1997 to improve\r\nits format and its content. While we consider these\r\nmeasures still insufficient, the new format of the report\r\nmust be considered as an achievement in the context of\r\nthe strong desire and efforts for greater transparency in\r\nthe work of the Council and for greater participation by\r\nnon-members. It also represents a step in the direction of\r\nallowing a more meaningful debate on the Council’s\r\nreport, an objective which, in our view, the United\r\nNations membership should continue to pursue constantly\r\nand with sincere determination.\r\nAmong the changes and additions that appear in this\r\nyear’s report, one would note first of all the inclusion for\r\neach subject of background information on the decisions\r\nand resolutions of the Council as well as presidential\r\nstatements for the one-year period preceding the period\r\ncovered; the description, in chronological order, of the\r\nCouncil’s consideration of the matter in question and of\r\nactions it took on that item, including descriptions of\r\ndecisions, resolutions and presidential statements; and the\r\ninsertion of factual data, including dates of formal\r\nmeetings and informal consultations on which a subject\r\nwas discussed. All these elements help provide a clearer\r\nand more concise picture of the events relevant to the\r\nvarious items. We especially appreciate the fact that for\r\neach of them the report contains a brief description of the\r\nsubject matter of the informal consultations of the whole.\r\nWe would like also to praise the inclusion in the\r\nreport of a separate part — part V — on the work of the\r\nsubsidiary organs of the Security Council, such as the\r\nsanctions committees, the two ad hoc Tribunals for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, the Governing\r\nCouncil of the United Nations Compensation Commission\r\nand the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM).\r\nThe activities of the sanctions committees, the United\r\nNations Compensation Commission and UNSCOM were\r\npreviously described in the introduction to the report,\r\nwhereas the Council’s action on questions related to the\r\nYugoslav Tribunal was indicated under one of the items\r\nconcerning the situation in the former Yugoslavia. In its\r\nnew format, the report not only provides more detailed\r\ninformation about the work of the sanctions committees,\r\nbut also includes a summary of the activities of the two\r\nad hoc Tribunals. These are indeed positive developments,\r\nas they enhance the analytical and comprehensive\r\ncharacter of the report — something which, I recall, had\r\nbeen called for repeatedly.\r\nSections V and VI of the appendices contain the text\r\nof all resolutions adopted by the Security Council and all\r\nstatements made and/or issued by the President of the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nSecurity Council during the period in question. Once again,\r\nwe are pleased with this change, which results in a more\r\nrational presentation of the text of the Council’s decisions\r\nand presidential statements.\r\nUndoubtedly, the most innovative measure reflected in\r\nthis year’s report is the inclusion, as an addendum, of the\r\nmonthly assessment of the work of the Council by\r\nrepresentatives who have completed their functions as\r\nPresident of the Council. Although these assessments are\r\nprepared under the sole responsibility of each former\r\nPresident of the Council and are not to be considered as\r\nrepresenting the views of the Council, they complement the\r\nreport in a very useful manner, especially where they\r\ncontain indications on priorities given and new trends that\r\nhave emerged in the work of the Council.\r\nWe are confident that the practice of the monthly\r\npresidential assessments will constantly evolve towards a\r\nless factual and more conceptual analysis of the Council’s\r\nactivity. We would also like to encourage the future\r\nPresidents of the Council to follow the very good example\r\nset by Ambassador Berrocal Soto of Costa Rica during his\r\nDecember 1997 presidency and submit the monthly\r\nassessment for publication and distribution as a separate\r\ndocument of the General Assembly and of the Security\r\nCouncil. Such a measure would do a great deal to increase\r\nthe transparency of the work of the Council.\r\nAs I have already stated, there are areas in which the\r\nformat and content of the report are still, in our opinion,\r\ninsufficient to enhance the interaction between the Council\r\nand the General Assembly. I refer in particular to the need\r\nfor substantive indications of the process leading to the\r\nCouncil’s decisions. We believe that the report should give\r\na brief account not only of the dates and subject matter of\r\nthe various informal consultations, but also of discussions\r\non crisis areas, regional tensions, humanitarian emergencies\r\nand other issues crucial to international peace and to local\r\nand global stability. I think that we are entitled to know\r\nwho said what. This is really very important for us to know\r\nwhen they come to us and ask to be re-elected and given a\r\nnew mandate. I am speaking of the elected members, of\r\ncourse.\r\nWe continue to believe that the full transparency of\r\nthe work of the Council is no less important than the\r\neffective performance of the Council’s mandate. What we\r\nneed is a true balance between these two principles, in\r\naccordance with the letter and the spirit of Article 24 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, which states that the Members of\r\nthe Organization\r\n“confer on the Security Council primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, and agree that in carrying out its\r\nduties under this responsibility the Security Council\r\nacts on their behalf”.\r\nWe are also of the view that other aspects of the\r\nreport could be improved, for example by providing more\r\nanalytical information on meetings with troop-contributing\r\ncountries, as well as by highlighting the extent to which\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on issues falling within the\r\nscope of both the Assembly and the Security Council are\r\ntaken into account by the Council in its decision-making.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that the Security Council should\r\nfully implement the provision contained in Article 24 (3)\r\nof the Charter concerning the submission of special\r\nreports by the Council to the General Assembly. For these\r\npurposes, General Assembly resolution 51/193, adopted in\r\nDecember 1997, remains a good basis for analysis and\r\ndiscussion.\r\nAs our colleague Ambassador Greenstock pointed\r\nout, during the period covered by the report the Council\r\nhas continued its intense activity in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and related humanitarian\r\naspects.\r\nThe number of meetings held and of decisions taken\r\nremains high, and this, in my view, is the most\r\nconvincing evidence of the commitment of the members\r\nof the Council — both permanent and elected — to\r\nperforming their mandate. There is a need to further\r\nensure that this mandate is carried out with full\r\ntransparency so as to enhance, and not to undermine in\r\nany way, the fundamental role of the General Assembly\r\nas the major pillar of the United Nations. What is\r\nnecessary, in our opinion, is to increase the public\r\nmeetings and to reduce the secret ones.\r\nOur New Zealand colleague, Ambassador Michael\r\nPowles, referred this morning to an eminent journalist,\r\nMr. Abe Rosenthal, the former executive editor of The\r\nNew York Times, who recently recalled\r\n“The culture of secrecy is so imbedded in the\r\nwork of the Council that the victims, the public and\r\nthe press take it for granted. They assume it was\r\nalways that way.\r\n“No, it was not ... For more than 20 years after\r\nthe UN was created in 1945, almost all Council\r\nmeetings were open.”\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nAnd the journalist added:\r\n“Except for the selection of the Secretary-General, the\r\nCouncil met in its own chamber, TV and reporters\r\npresent, every word recorded ...\r\n“Most important of all, people of any country\r\ncould see what their diplomatic representatives and\r\nGovernment were doing to help the world or hurt it.”\r\n(“The Secret Council”, The New York Times, 6 March\r\n1998)\r\nOn this and other aspects, some progress has been\r\nmade in the right direction, yet much remains to be done.\r\nIn particular, many of us were unpleasantly surprised when\r\ncomparing this year’s statement by the five permanent\r\nmembers after their meeting with the Secretary-General\r\nwith their 1997 statement on the same issue. Last year they\r\nspoke of the need to increase the “transparency and\r\nefficiency” of the Council. This year, a reference is made\r\nonly to “efficiency”; in other words, “transparency” has\r\nbeen dropped. May I take the liberty of reminding the\r\ndelegations of the five permanent members that\r\ntransparency is not a concept they can freely dispose of. On\r\nthe contrary, it is a concept strictly linked to the\r\naccountability that all members of the Security Council\r\nalike, permanent and elected, should have vis-à-vis this\r\nAssembly.\r\nI did not come here today prepared to discuss in detail\r\nthe issue of Security Council reform, and in particular the\r\nCouncil’s enlargement. I had instead expected — and I\r\nexpect — to tackle this important issue under the agenda\r\nitem allocated to it, that is, item 59. However, since some\r\nspeakers this morning raised the question, I feel obliged to\r\nrefer to it.\r\nThe rumour is being circulated in some quarters that\r\nmy country, Italy — specifically, my delegation — is trying\r\nto obstruct the reform process. This is a slanderous rumour.\r\nNothing could be further from the truth. Italy is deeply\r\ncommitted and has been committed from the very\r\nbeginning to the reform of the Council, and in particular to\r\nits expansion. At the very beginning of the exercise Italy\r\ntabled a very specific proposal that received the support or\r\ninterest of more than 80 countries. Here in this very room,\r\n80 countries spoke in favour of or commented in favourable\r\nterms about this Italian proposal. Later on Italy declared\r\nitself ready to also accept the fall-back position of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement — that is to say, an increase for the\r\ntime being in elective seats only — a proposal that already\r\nenjoys the support of 113 countries. And in this year’s\r\ngeneral debate, at the Assembly’s 11th meeting, Italian\r\nForeign Minister Dini went even further. The Italian\r\nGovernment, he said, would be willing to support any\r\nreasonable formula — I repeat, any reasonable formula —\r\nprovided that it does not prejudice the eventual\r\nestablishment of a common European seat on the Council,\r\ndistance Italy from the other principal industrial countries\r\nor increase the number of countries that are “more equal”\r\nthan others, transforming the majority of Member States\r\nfrom protagonists into mere spectators of these few\r\ncountries’ decisions. How can anyone, how can anyone in\r\ngood faith call this obstructionism?\r\nWhat we are opposing, and we are opposing it, I\r\nmust admit, with great determination — and we are\r\ncertainly not alone in this — are attempts by one side to\r\npass the reform with a vote of less than the two thirds of\r\nthe United Nations Member States provided for in Article\r\n108 of the Charter. What we are opposed to is any elitist,\r\nselective and undemocratic solution which would be to\r\nthe advantage of very few and to the detriment of a great\r\nmany Members of our Organization.\r\nMr. Monteiro (Portugal): On 31 December, Portugal\r\nwill conclude its current mandate as a member of the\r\nSecurity Council. This mandate, conferred by the General\r\nAssembly through elections, is an honour and\r\nresponsibility that we have accepted with utter seriousness\r\nand have tried to exercise fully and effectively.\r\nThe task which the Security Council is entrusted\r\nwith is one of the primary purposes set out in the United\r\nNations Charter: the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. To this end, Portugal and the other members\r\nof the Council are mandated to act on behalf of all the\r\nMembers of the United Nations. This task is not an easy\r\none; I agree with the Permanent Representative of\r\nSwaziland, who described it as almost needing divine\r\ninspiration. But it is one which the members of the\r\nCouncil, including Portugal, undertake to perform on\r\nbehalf of all those Member States that have seats in this\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nActing on behalf of the United Nations Members\r\nimplies, in our view, that the Council is also accountable\r\nto them. This does not in any way weaken the authority\r\nof the Council. On the contrary, it reinforces it, by\r\nproviding a clearer picture of its activities and a better\r\nunderstanding of its responsibilities. This is why Portugal\r\nand others have struggled to help bring about a more\r\ntransparent Council, with full participation by Member\r\nStates. The consideration of the report of the Security\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nCouncil by the General Assembly today is the very\r\nexpression of that accountability.\r\nFurthermore, the report is important because it\r\npreserves for posterity the memory of that principal organ\r\nof the United Nations. Hence the need to be informative,\r\naccurate and comprehensive in the report.\r\nAs was underlined by the President of the Council,\r\nAmbassador Greenstock, in his important address this\r\nmorning, this report is indeed more informative than those\r\nof previous years and permits a better understanding of the\r\nwork of the Security Council. Also more reader-friendly,\r\nthe report includes assessments by the various Presidents of\r\nthe Council of the activities carried out during their\r\nrespective presidencies, providing interesting and further\r\ninsights into the work carried out by the Council.\r\nAfter my first presidency, in April 1997, I wrote an\r\nassessment of the work of the Security Council during that\r\nmonth — the first such assessment to be written — which\r\nwas made available to all Member States at the time. This\r\npaved the way for the establishment of the Council’s\r\ncurrent practice.\r\nWhile focusing on the past, this report does at the\r\nsame time, in our view, reveal a new trend for the future —\r\na future in which participation is not merely a theoretical\r\nstipulation but also a concrete reality.\r\nMembers of the Council have understood the\r\nimportance of following this trend. They have suggested\r\nvarious measures for improving the methods of work of the\r\nCouncil and increasing the participation of the general\r\nmembership in its work. In an annex to the assessment of\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Costa Rica, readers will be\r\nable to see a letter that was sent last December by 10\r\nmembers of the Council — the 10 elected Members —\r\ncontaining their suggestions as a result of the experience\r\nthey garnered in the Security Council. Five of these\r\nMembers were at the end of their terms, while the other\r\nfive were halfway through theirs. This was an important\r\ninitiative that generated a useful discussion on the methods\r\nof work among Council members, as well as in the working\r\ngroup on documentation and procedures.\r\nFollowing that initiative, we hope that very soon a\r\ncertain number of measures will be ready for consideration\r\nby the Council, and this may allow for improved\r\nparticipation in the Council’s work by Member States —\r\nespecially those States that contribute to peacekeeping\r\noperations — and pave the way for the Council to enhance\r\nthe transparency of its work through an increased number\r\nof public meetings.\r\nThe efforts towards transparency must be pursued\r\nconsistently and continuously. I am confident that this\r\nwork will carry on. Others will follow in our footsteps\r\nand continue to strive for these goals. I am encouraged by\r\nthe strong will expressed in this direction by all of the\r\nnew, incoming members of the Council, recently elected\r\nfor 1999-2000, over the need persistently to enhance the\r\ntransparency of the Council, increase the participation of\r\nMember States in its work and improve the relationship\r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly. I recall,\r\nparticularly, the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Canada, The Honourable Lloyd Axworthy, who, during\r\nthe recent general debate, called for a more open and\r\ntransparent Security Council and for the full exercise of\r\nthe rights of participation of Member States in its work,\r\nas conferred by the Charter, He wisely said,\r\n“Far from constraining the Council’s efficiency, this\r\nwill improve the decisions it takes and render its\r\nactions more effective.” (A/53/PV.15)\r\nThe question of increasing the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council is currently at a stalemate. It is,\r\ntherefore, important to press for a change in the methods\r\nof the work of the Council. This course of action might\r\neven facilitate at a later stage the consideration of the\r\nquestion of equitable representation of the general\r\nmembership in the Council, in a manner more adapted to\r\nthe current international situation. No doubt the Security\r\nCouncil would thus increase its legitimacy.\r\nIn our view, the work carried out within the\r\nframework of the General Assembly by the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group will continue to represent a decisive\r\ncontribution to that end. The important goals that we want\r\nto achieve require the efforts of both the Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe challenges raised by the various conflicts and\r\ndisputes in the world today continue to call for a strong\r\nSecurity Council. Its authority and efficiency must\r\ntherefore be preserved. We should discourage\r\nconfrontation or division among United Nations organs or\r\nbetween these organs and regional organizations. We\r\nshould encourage respect for the specific powers with\r\nwhich they have been invested and promote the\r\ncoordination of efforts, among them efforts towards\r\nachieving our common goals. Very recently, following a\r\npublic debate on Africa, the Council demonstrated its\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nopenness towards this objective and, through its resolution\r\n1197 (1998), established a comprehensive framework of\r\ncooperation with regional organizations in Africa. We are\r\nconfident this will serve as a model for other parts of the\r\nworld and other regional organizations.\r\nWithin the United Nations, different organs\r\ncomplement one another in performing their functions. This\r\nnotion of complementarity, a cornerstone of the structure\r\ncreated by the Charter, requires not only transparency of the\r\norgans but also the full exercise of initiative on their part.\r\nAs we have said before, the Security Council has to do\r\nmore to improve the transparency of its methods of work\r\nand the participation of Member States. As a key player,\r\nthe General Assembly should also have a more dynamic\r\nrole in this regard and should continue to take the necessary\r\nsteps towards the same goal.\r\nThe Secretary-General, through his initiatives and his\r\naction in the process he is conducting to reform the\r\nOrganization, has shown us how to move forward, giving\r\nform to the very notion of complementarity of the organs\r\nwithin the United Nations. Let us follow his example and\r\nthe impetus he has created and continue to try from within\r\nthe General Assembly, in a convergent action, to improve\r\nthe relationship with the Security Council and to ensure an\r\nenhanced flow of information and greater participation by\r\nthe general membership in the work of that organ.\r\nThe Security Council’s work is quite demanding. The\r\nCouncil must act promptly with regard to events around the\r\nworld. There is an increased expectation on the part of the\r\ninternational community with regard to the response by the\r\nCouncil to various conflicts or disputes. Members of the\r\nCouncil feel this pressure. They know they must act quickly\r\nbut effectively in each of the situations with which they are\r\nfaced every day in the Council. As reflected in the annual\r\nreport, the Council is spending more and more time on its\r\nwork in comparison with previous years. This situation\r\nraises particular difficulties for smaller States with Missions\r\nthat cannot easily bear the heavy burden that the work in\r\nthe Council represents. This is an important challenge for\r\nthese States, which must turn the difficulties in their work\r\ninto incentives for an effective term on the Council.\r\nWe know that in the exercise of the functions of the\r\nCouncil, there is sometimes a tendency to rely on the work\r\nof the permanent members. I would like to stress, however,\r\nthat there is a fundamental role to be played by the elected\r\nmembers within the Council, and in particular by smaller\r\nStates. Often, it is these smaller States that are in a better\r\nposition to understand the situations of conflict and dispute,\r\neither because they are geographically closer to the States\r\ninvolved or because they have similar economic, social\r\nand political conditions. Their contributions are therefore\r\nvery important in assessing and evaluating solutions to\r\nenable the Council to take better decisions.\r\nThis does not undermine the roles of either the\r\npermanent members or of other large States in the work\r\nof the Council. In fact, the power of the Council lies in\r\nthe ability of its members to complement each other,\r\nthrough their diverse perspectives, and to merge in\r\nmaking a coherent decision. The binding nature of the\r\ndecisions of the Security Council, as determined by the\r\nCharter, only highlights this importance.\r\nLet me underline some other issues to which we\r\nhave dedicated a considerable part of our efforts during\r\nPortugal’s mandate in the Council.\r\nThe General Assembly, through the adoption of its\r\nresolution on An Agenda for Peace, made an important\r\ncontribution to the subject of sanctions, developing new\r\nideas on sanctions regimes and suggesting practical\r\nmeasures to improve their implementation. It was a\r\nchallenge to which the Council has yet to respond.\r\nPortugal remains committed to engaging the Council\r\nin a profound reflection over this issue, which is today a\r\nmatter of concern to the international community, as\r\nclearly reflected in the General Assembly resolution,\r\nbearing in mind the increasing number of sanctions\r\nregimes and their impact on international relations.\r\nAs Chairman of the Security Council Committee\r\nestablished by resolution 661 (1990) concerning the\r\nsituation between Iraq and Kuwait, and following the\r\nimplementation of the most comprehensive humanitarian\r\noperation ever undertaken by the United Nations, I am\r\nvery aware of the difficulties involved in the\r\nimplementation of sanctions, their efficiency and their\r\nside effects. The Committee has undertaken every effort\r\nin order to improve the implementation of the\r\nhumanitarian operation, and the results have been\r\nundeniably positive. The cooperation of the Iraqi\r\nGovernment with the Secretary-General and his initiatives\r\nin adapting the structures of the Secretariat have been\r\ncrucial to the success of the operation, which aims at\r\nalleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of\r\neight years of the most severe sanctions ever imposed by\r\nthe United Nations, which have, unfortunately, yet to\r\nachieve their desired objectives.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nThe Council should reflect profoundly on this. Despite\r\nthe size of the humanitarian programme, it is not sufficient\r\nto resolve all the problems of the Iraqi people; after all, it\r\nwas not conceived to do so. In its implementation, however,\r\nall interested parties have been learning from their daily\r\nexperience in this operation, which started almost two years\r\nago.\r\nOther chairpersons of sanctions committees have their\r\nown experience in implementing different sanctions\r\nregimes. The experience gathered so far should not be\r\nwasted. It should be kept for the benefit of the Council and\r\nfuture members. With this purpose in mind, we are engaged\r\nwith members of the Council in a discussion on new\r\nmeasures to help future improvements in the\r\nimplementation of sanctions, as well as to prevent their\r\nhaving a negative humanitarian impact by a better targeting\r\nof their effects. This subject should be the topic of\r\ndiscussion by the entire membership and a public debate\r\nshould be prompted on the issue. We believe that the\r\nCouncil would benefit from this — from receiving different\r\nviews and suggestions that would be presented.\r\nPortugal considers that a public debate of thematic\r\naspects particularly relevant to the work of the Council is\r\nan important part of its activities. Early on in our mandate,\r\nI proposed an open debate on post-conflict peace-building,\r\nwhich I considered would be useful for the Council to\r\nidentify crucial issues relevant to its own decisions. I am\r\nhappy to see that thematic debates have become an\r\nimportant part of the programme of the Council. We are\r\nalso encouraged by the interest expressed by Member States\r\nin participating in these public meetings of the Council.\r\nThis also holds true for the open debates that the\r\nCouncil has held on specific issues with the participation of\r\nrepresentatives of United Nations agencies and the\r\nSecretariat. We welcome the greater participation in the\r\nwork of the Council of high-level representatives of the\r\nSecretariat and United Nations agencies, such as the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund and the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. To overcome the\r\nchallenges that the Council is faced with today, we need\r\ntheir input and their invaluable experience. That is why we\r\nhave always supported their participation in meetings of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nAmong these, I recall the meetings on children in\r\narmed conflict, which were held during the June presidency\r\nof Portugal this year, and more recently on the protection\r\nfor humanitarian assistance to refugees and others in\r\nconflict situations, in which the contributions of interested\r\nparties were very important to the action subsequently\r\nundertaken by the Council.\r\nThe Security Council should listen more to the other\r\nactors on the international scene, who, outside the United\r\nNations or the intergovernmental framework, have deep\r\nknowledge of international issues, follow closely the\r\nproblems associated with the resurgence of conflicts and\r\nundertake many actions to help prevent them. I wish to\r\nrefer here to non-governmental organizations, as\r\nrepresenting civil society, which have been kept apart\r\nfrom the work of the Council. Their activities have\r\nproved to be crucial in the process of pacification of\r\ninternational conflicts, in which, facing considerable risks,\r\nthey continue to assist people in need.\r\nIn fact, the Council, in its decisions, has appealed\r\nfrequently to non-governmental organizations,\r\nacknowledging thereby the importance of their action in\r\nthe prevention of conflicts and in the peace-building\r\nefforts of the United Nations. The importance of these\r\norganizations in preventing illicit arms trafficking by\r\nhelping Security Council sanctions committees to monitor\r\nviolations of arms embargoes was also recognized\r\nrecently by the Council in its resolution 1196 (1998).\r\nThe Secretary-General, for his part, in a conference\r\nlast month, underlined the important role played by non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in raising public awareness,\r\ntweaking the world’s conscience and shaping policy.\r\nCalling for a partnership, he has demonstrated how\r\ncooperation is increasing between the United Nations and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, with mutual benefits in\r\nseveral areas. This implies, naturally, more responsibility\r\non the part of non-governmental organizations, which, in\r\nthe words of the Secretary-General, have to protect\r\nthemselves against the abuse of the idea of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and protect their invaluable\r\nfranchise.\r\nWe do not see why the Council should keep itself\r\nclosed to the important source of information and\r\nassistance that these organizations represent. It should, in\r\nfact, listen carefully to them, and encourage and protect\r\ntheir action to prevent and resolve international conflicts.\r\nWe are therefore encouraged by positive signs within the\r\nCouncil in this regard.\r\nThe Security Council maintains a close and day-to-\r\nday relationship with the press. The nature of the matters\r\nconsidered by the Council requires the prompt\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\ndissemination of information all over the world. The press\r\namplifies the decisions taken by the Council. The\r\nrelationship between them is thus of the utmost importance\r\nto the efficiency of those decisions. The Council should\r\nmake all the necessary efforts to preserve that relationship\r\nand to prevent the effects of partial or imperfect\r\ninformation. The gap between what appears in the\r\nnewspapers with regard to the work of the Council and the\r\ninformation that its President is mandated to convey to the\r\npress is, unfortunately, increasing. This permits different\r\ninterpretations of the will of the Council. The way is\r\ntherefore open to the manipulation of information, which,\r\nin our view, should be firmly prevented.\r\nAs to Member States, the information is mainly\r\nconveyed through briefings by the presidency of the\r\nCouncil. We believe that those briefings are the best way\r\nto ensure the objectivity and impartiality of the information\r\non the work of the Council. We have tried, during our\r\npresidencies, to hold these briefings regularly and\r\nimmediately upon the conclusion of the consultations of the\r\nwhole, recognizing the importance for Member States of\r\nprompt information on the different subjects under\r\nconsideration by the Council. These briefings should be\r\nfurther encouraged and improved, as they constitute\r\nappropriate channels of information to Member States\r\noutside the Council and prevent information from being\r\nunduly influenced by national interests.\r\nThe experience of Portugal in the Council has been\r\nhighly gratifying, even if we feel a certain amount of\r\nfrustration at all that we would have liked to do, but for\r\nwhich we have run out of time. We admire the tireless\r\nwork carried out by all its members, my colleagues in the\r\nCouncil, and the Secretariat in its daily activities, which is\r\nof vital importance to the international community. We\r\nknow better now how difficult it is to have the burden of\r\ntaking decisions that affect so many countries, regions and\r\npeople.\r\nThe ideas I have just put forward do not represent a\r\ncriticism of the Council. Rather, they should be envisaged\r\nas constructive inputs. We will leave the Council with an\r\neven greater respect for its role and its action, which is\r\nfundamental for the preservation of peace and international\r\nsecurity.\r\nOnce outside the Council, we will continue to strive\r\nfor an even better Security Council, one that is more\r\nrepresentative and transparent, without losing sight of the\r\nneed to preserve its efficiency. We will not see it as a\r\ndistant body. The renovation of the Council is also a way\r\nof bringing it closer to the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. On the other hand, we are confident that\r\nwithin the Council, efforts will continue to be made to\r\npursue these goals. Its members are fully aware that that\r\nis not only the expectation but also the will of the\r\ninternational community. And it is the international\r\ncommunity, after all, that the Security Council represents.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nI would like to associate myself with previous speakers in\r\nexpressing appreciation to the Permanent Representative\r\nof the United Kingdom, Ambassador Greenstock, who, as\r\nthe current President of the Security Council, introduced\r\nthe annual report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMy delegation has carefully reviewed the report\r\ncontained in document A/53/2, covering the period from\r\n16 June 1997 to 15 June 1998. We welcome the\r\nimprovements that have been introduced into the present\r\nreport, in particular the provision of some information\r\nabout the consultations of the whole and the attachment\r\nof the monthly assessments of the former Presidents of\r\nthe Council.\r\nAccording to the report, during the period covered\r\nthe Security Council made enormous efforts to deal with\r\nissues related to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security in several parts of the world, some of which\r\nwere more successful than others.\r\nDuring the period covered, the Security Council\r\nconsidered the Afghanistan crisis under its responsibility\r\nto maintain international peace and security, and issued\r\nthree presidential statements on the subject. The Council\r\nrejected the notion that the Afghanistan crisis had a\r\nmilitary solution and called for the prompt cessation of\r\nhostilities and the resumption of inter-Afghan negotiations\r\nto establish a broad-based Government with a view to\r\nreaching a lasting and peaceful settlement of the crisis.\r\nBut as a matter of deep concern, the Taliban\r\nmovement, in a clear case of contempt for the will of the\r\ninternational community, intensified its military operations\r\nin the northern part of that country, committed heinous\r\ncrimes against humanity, pursued a policy of systematic\r\nethnic and religious persecution and, in a flagrant\r\nviolation of international law, stormed our Consulate-\r\nGeneral in Mazar-i-Sharif and murdered Iranian diplomats\r\nin cold blood, which raised worldwide outrage and\r\ncondemnation. We welcome the timely reaction of the\r\nCouncil to the recent developments in Afghanistan, which\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nof course go beyond the period covered by the present\r\nreport. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that the situation in\r\nAfghanistan requires the continued attention of the Council\r\nin discharging its main responsibility under the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nIn Tajikistan, peace and tranquillity, however fragile,\r\nprevail. They have been achieved through the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, the support of a number of regional States\r\nand, indeed, the strong determination and good faith of the\r\nGovernment of Tajikistan and of the opposition. While\r\nthere is fear that peace and stability in Tajikistan will be\r\ndisturbed by the Taliban, our earnest hope is that the\r\ncommitment to the General Agreement on the\r\nEstablishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan\r\nand its Protocols will lead that country to prosperity and\r\nirreversible peace and stability.\r\nDuring the period covered, the Council dealt with\r\nseveral issues in Africa. The number and the intensity of\r\narmed conflicts on the continent which are considered to\r\nhave threatened peace and security continue to be a source\r\nof grave concern for the international community.\r\nThe inclusion of an item entitled “The situation in\r\nAfrica” in the Council’s agenda and the convening of two\r\nmeetings at the ministerial level were a sign that the\r\nCouncil needs to do more about the situation in Africa. The\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, dated 13 April 1998, on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa and the follow-up\r\nmeasures taken by the Council, including the establishment\r\nof an ad hoc Working Group to review the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations in that report, raised\r\nexpectations that the peace, security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment so deserved by people in Africa will receive\r\nas much attention and devotion as they do in other parts of\r\nthe world.\r\nWe believe that it is the legitimate right of the\r\nMember States, which conferred on the Security Council\r\nthe responsibility for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, to receive special annual reports and be fully\r\naware of its activities. Despite the great number of\r\nquestions before the Security Council which are considered\r\nto have threatened international peace and security, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has not received any special report\r\nduring the past half century. We believe that the time is\r\nripe to define the word “necessary” in Article 24, paragraph\r\n3, of the Charter. The Working Group on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is the appropriate forum to take up this\r\nimportant issue.\r\nOne of the improvements introduced into the present\r\nreport is the inclusion of information about the issues\r\nconsidered in the consultations of the whole. It is well\r\nknown that the important decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil are taken during those consultations. My\r\ndelegation welcomes this improvement. Nevertheless, we\r\ncontinue to believe that the present report reflects very\r\nlittle substantive information about those consultations,\r\nwhich are the basis for the formal decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council. The report still needs to be further\r\nimproved by providing an analytical assessment of the\r\nprocess of decision-making of the Security Council in\r\nsuch consultations.\r\nIn the absence of substantive information on the\r\nconsultations of the whole, the main avenue available to\r\nall non-members of the Security Council is to wait around\r\nthe South Lounge for scattered pieces of information and\r\nto attend the briefings by the Council presidency, which\r\ndepend on the individual approach of the Council\r\nPresident at the time.\r\nWhile emphasizing the need for all Council members\r\nto inform non-members, we believe that there is also a\r\nneed for structured contact between the non-permanent\r\nmembers and the members of the geographical groups\r\nfrom which they have been elected to serve in the\r\nSecurity Council. Such contact would enable the non-\r\nmembers to be informed of the latest developments in the\r\nCouncil and eventually enhance the participation of non-\r\nmembers in the work of the Council, thereby promoting\r\nthe credibility, authority and effectiveness of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nAccording to Articles 10, 11 and 12 of the Charter,\r\nthe General Assembly may discuss and make\r\nrecommendations on the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security to Member States or the Security\r\nCouncil or to both. It was first thought that the favourable\r\natmosphere created by the ending of the cold war would\r\nallow for structuring a balanced interaction between the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. While the\r\nCouncil has been actively engaged in this field,\r\nregrettably the Assembly has found little opportunity to\r\ndischarge its responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security in cooperation with the\r\nCouncil. In order to realize the goal of these Charter\r\nArticles, it is necessary to find proper ways to use the\r\npotential of the general membership of the United Nations\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nI should not conclude without referring to another\r\nimprovement in the present report — the inclusion of\r\nassessments by former Presidents of the Security Council.\r\nI would like to express appreciation to all Council\r\nPresidents for providing their assessments of the work of\r\nthe Council. At the same time, there seems to be an\r\nopportunity for improvement in this area. We hope these\r\nassessments will become more analytical and substantive in\r\nthe future, represent the view of the Council as a whole and\r\nbe published routinely, with a structured format,\r\nimmediately after the end of each presidency.\r\nMr. Ibrahim (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): Article 24 of the Charter states that United\r\nNations Members confer on the Security Council primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and agree that in carrying out its duties under this\r\nresponsibility the Council acts on their behalf. This means\r\nthat the Council is accountable to the Members of the\r\nOrganization in accordance with the principle that authority\r\nis not conferred without accountability.\r\nIt is with this understanding that my delegation\r\nparticipates in this debate. We feel that it is of paramount\r\nimportance since it provides the Members of the United\r\nNations an opportunity to review the work of the Security\r\nCouncil and to evaluate its activities in the light of the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nWhen the General Assembly considered the reports of\r\nthe Security Council at previous sessions, many comments\r\nwere made with regard to the Council’s working methods\r\nand many proposals were submitted on the form and\r\ncontent of its annual report.\r\nIt is gratifying to note at this session that the\r\npublication of the journal of the Security Council on a daily\r\nand monthly basis has become an established practice. The\r\nperiodic briefings by the Presidents of the Security Council\r\nprovided an opportunity for Members to have access to\r\nmore information regarding the Council’s informal\r\nconsultations.\r\nDespite that, the proposals to improve the work of the\r\nSecurity Council and to improve the preparation of its\r\nannual report have not been sufficiently taken into account.\r\nThe report of the Security Council contained in\r\ndocument A/53/2 has brief information on the subsidiary\r\norgans of the Council, including the sanctions committees.\r\nAppendices V and VI contain the resolutions and\r\npresidential statements adopted by the Council during the\r\nperiod under review. Part I of the report contains brief\r\nreviews of what took place in the informal consultations\r\nprior to the adoption of these resolutions and presidential\r\nstatements. The addendum included in the report contains\r\nthe monthly assessments by the successive Presidents of\r\nthe Council. This feature has been included for the first\r\ntime, and we consider it a great improvement.\r\nWe hope the Security Council will follow up with\r\nother improvements, with a view to fulfilling the need for\r\nmore transparency in its consideration of the issues, for\r\nan official evaluation of the problems it handles, and for\r\nthe rationale behind the statements and the relevant\r\nresolutions it adopts.\r\nMost of the delegations that took part in the debate\r\nduring previous sessions stressed the importance of\r\nholding more open, formal meetings and limiting informal\r\nconsultations to the minimum possible. However, it seems\r\nto us that the Council did exactly the opposite. The record\r\nbefore us states that it held 103 formal meetings during\r\nwhich it adopted 61 resolutions and issued 41 statements.\r\nDespite the fact that the report mentions that the\r\nCouncil held 215 consultations of the whole, totalling\r\nsome 588 hours, it does not have any information on the\r\ndebates that took place during these consultations —\r\ninformation that the Council often provides to high-level\r\nofficials of the Organization’s Secretariat.\r\nMy delegation fully understands that a small group\r\nwould enable the Security Council to accelerate its work.\r\nBut it is untenable to have recourse to informal\r\nconsultations in such an unacceptable way that would cast\r\naspersions on the legitimacy of the work of the Security\r\nCouncil as far as the rest of the membership of the United\r\nNations are concerned. It is this membership that has\r\nentrusted the Council its main responsibility in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nParagraph 1 of Article 15 of the Charter states that\r\nthe General Assembly shall receive and consider annual\r\nand special reports from the Security Council that shall\r\ninclude an account of the measures taken by the Council\r\nto maintain international peace and security. We do not\r\nrecall that the Council has recently provided any special\r\nreports, despite the conflicts in many parts of the world.\r\nIf the Council had provided the Assembly special reports\r\non these events, then, in collaboration with the Assembly,\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nit might have provided solutions for such problems and thus\r\naverted possible tragedies and suffering.\r\nIt is possible that the Council has its reasons. If that\r\nis indeed the case, it would have behooved the Council to\r\nclarify those reasons in its annual report in order for the\r\nAssembly to consider them and find other means to avert\r\nfuture tragedies.\r\nThe report of the Security Council contains a list of\r\nCouncil consultations with the States that contribute troops\r\nfor peacekeeping operations. My delegation welcomes this\r\ninasmuch as it has been a demand which the Member\r\nStates have advanced and insisted upon. But we must\r\nexpress our concern that the Council is not committed to\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations as in the case of its\r\ndisregarding consultations with other States which are not\r\nCouncil members and which are parties to a conflict under\r\nconsideration by the Council, as is provided for by Article\r\n31 of the Charter.\r\nOur experience with the Security Council has made it\r\nclear that some Council members do not just oppose\r\nadhering to Article 31. Their inclination towards\r\nunilateralism and towards the adoption of resolutions with\r\nuncommon and unjustifiable haste with regard to complex\r\nissues has in fact been accentuated.\r\nOn 25 August last, the United States and the United\r\nKingdom presented a draft resolution to the Security\r\nCouncil on their dispute with my country concerning the\r\nLockerbie incident. On 27 August, the Council adopted the\r\ndraft resolution even before the documents annexed to it\r\nhad been translated and before the authorities concerned in\r\nmy country had had a chance to consider them. This\r\nconduct ignored the call for transparency and openness in\r\nthe work of the Security Council. It also resulted in wasting\r\nan opportunity to adopt a resolution that would take into\r\naccount the interests of all parties concerned to expedite the\r\nresolution of a conflict, and hasten the lifting of sanctions\r\nfrom which the Libyan people have suffered for almost\r\nseven years.\r\nThe Security Council has taken many measures to\r\nimprove its annual report, and we hope that such measures\r\nwill pave the way for others that would make the report\r\nmore comprehensive so that in the future it may contain\r\njustifications for the Council’s actions.\r\nThis should also include a comprehensive and clear\r\nsummary of discussions taking place in informal\r\nconsultations, especially when there is a periodic review of\r\nsanctions. This would enable other States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations to learn in a documented way the\r\npositions taken by Council members during such\r\nconsultations. Only then will the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly really reflect the\r\nCouncil’s work and honestly record its activities.\r\nWe consider that it is important to review the\r\nworking methods of the sanctions committees with a view\r\nto enabling the countries concerned to attend the meetings\r\nand state their views on these issues. We also consider\r\nthat the Security Council should return to the proper\r\npractice, and enable other Members of the United Nations\r\nto state their views regarding the issues under discussion,\r\nand to contribute to the decision-making process, instead\r\nof being confronted with predetermined resolutions on\r\nmatters that affect them all. The Council should broaden\r\nthe base of its consultations with States not members of\r\nthe Council particularly those that are concerned with\r\nwhat the Council is discussing. That is one of the\r\nprincipal means to legitimize the Council resolutions, and\r\nto improve the possibility of their being implemented.\r\nMy delegation wishes in conclusion, to reaffirm the\r\nimportance of strengthening dialogue and interaction\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council.\r\nThis should not be limited to a single annual occasion,\r\nwhen the Assembly considers the Council’s report.\r\nRather, it should be an ongoing process based on the\r\nprimary Charter responsibilities of those two organs.\r\nMr. Larraín (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nI wish first of all to congratulate Ambassador Sir Jeremy\r\nGreenstock, Permanent Representative of the United\r\nKingdom and current President of the Security Council,\r\non his clear and concise introduction of the report of the\r\nCouncil for the period 16 June 1997 to 15 June 1998. My\r\ncongratulations go also to the devoted staff of the\r\nSecurity Council secretariat on their excellent work.\r\nThis is the first report to contain assessments made\r\nby the successive Presidents of the Council, in their\r\npersonal capacity. As a member of the Council, Chile\r\nparticipated in the work of the informal working group of\r\nthe Security Council concerning the Council’s\r\ndocumentation and other procedural questions, which\r\ndevised this formula, which was described in the note by\r\nthe President of the Council of 12 June 1997\r\n(S/1997/451). This formula has enabled us to move\r\ntowards meeting the universal desire for more analytical\r\nand substantive reports, as expressed by an overwhelming\r\nmajority of the membership of the General Assembly\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nthrough the adoption of resolution 51/193 of 17 December\r\n1996, as aptly recalled this morning by the representative\r\nof Colombia.\r\nWe are pleased that from July 1997 each Council\r\nPresident prepared an assessment of the work of the\r\nCouncil during his presidency. This, we believe, is a\r\npractice that should be followed by all future Presidents; we\r\nurge all to follow the example of the delegation of Costa\r\nRica, which was the first to distribute copies of its\r\nassessment to all Member States well before the publication\r\nof the report before the Assembly today. We believe too\r\nthat future Presidents of the Council, especially those\r\nrepresenting non-permanent members, should try to include\r\nas much substantive information as possible so as to make\r\ngood use of this formula. These assessments should be a\r\nreal working tool for the other Members of the\r\nOrganization. Taken together, the 12 substantive\r\nassessments constitute a great contribution to transparency\r\nbecause they will enable the General Assembly to be better\r\ninformed about measures adopted or agreed upon by the\r\nSecurity Council relating to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, thus ensuring the necessary coordination\r\nand cooperation between the two organs.\r\nBy the same token, we think it would be most useful\r\nfor members of the Council to know the extent to which\r\nthis new formula of assessments by each Council President\r\nhas helped Member States to understand better how the\r\nCouncil is dealing with the matters pertaining to\r\ninternational peace and security that lie within its purview.\r\nThe report of the Council to the General Assembly is\r\nbasic to the good relations and coordination that must exist\r\nbetween the two organs; it falls within the general\r\nframework of the transparency that must characterize the\r\nwork of the Council. But these good relations and this\r\ntransparency do not end here: the Council should constantly\r\nimprove its working methods and increase their\r\ntransparency. To that end, there should be an effort\r\nincreasingly to reflect the discussions on so-called cluster\r\nII questions in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council. Along the same lines, the\r\nrecommendations set out in the position paper prepared by\r\nthe 10 elected members of the Council for 1997 are of\r\nparticular relevance; we had the honour to participate in the\r\npreparation of that paper. Such exercises within the Security\r\nCouncil are an effective way to promote greater\r\ntransparency and openness and should continue. Only in\r\nthis way can we put an end to formal, descriptive reports,\r\nwhich are of little use.\r\nIt would be impossible to refer now to all the items\r\nconsidered by the Security Council; I believe that each\r\ndelegation will speak of those that are of interest to it.\r\nMy delegation would like to note how the Council has\r\nbeen addressing the question of Africa over the past\r\nmonths, drawing its inspiration from the report of the\r\nSecretary-General of 13 April 1998, entitled “The causes\r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa” (S/1998/318). We\r\nparticularly welcomed the convening of a second\r\nministerial meeting on Africa and the establishment of an\r\nad hoc working group to consider all the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations; this led to the preparation of\r\na number of documents that were adopted by the Council.\r\nWe believe that the question of Africa must continue to\r\nbe considered exhaustively, using a comprehensive\r\napproach. The Council, along with the other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, must attach the highest priority to this\r\nmatter, and we are pleased that this is understood.\r\nTurning to another matter, two cases of sanctions\r\nimposed by the Council have evolved somewhat. I refer\r\nhere to the cases of Libya and of Iraq. We hope that the\r\nprocedural details of a trial in the Netherlands of the\r\nsuspects in the Lockerbie incident will be quickly\r\nclarified, and that these will not prove an obstacle, so that\r\nthe trial can take place, enabling the sanctions affecting\r\nthe Libyan people to be lifted soon.\r\nDuring the reporting period, one of the items that\r\nwas the focus of the greatest attention was the crisis with\r\nIraq, which took place early in the year. Thanks to the\r\ntimely intervention of the Secretary-General, military\r\naction was averted. While the tension that directly led to\r\nthe crisis seems to have abated, the situation in Iraq is far\r\nfrom satisfactory. That is why we express the hope that\r\na renewal of cooperation by Iraq with the United Nations,\r\nas a first step, and, as second step, a comprehensive\r\nreview of the sanctions imposed on that country by the\r\nSecurity Council, sending clear, precise and consensus-\r\nbased signals to Iraq as to what remains to be done, will\r\nvery soon permit the unblocking of this situation that has\r\nalready stretched out over many years and that has caused\r\nso much suffering to the Iraqi people.\r\nI would also like to refer to Haiti. Almost a year\r\nafter the Security Council established the United Nations\r\nCivilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH), my country\r\nconsiders that the role that Mission has played in creating\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\na professional police force that respects democratic values\r\nhas been of enormous significance. Nevertheless, despite\r\nthe progress achieved by MIPONUH, the political situation\r\nprevailing in Haiti today does not make it advisable to end\r\nthis Mission, whose mandate will expire on 30 November.\r\nIn this connection, my country believes that the\r\ninternational community has a duty towards the Haitian\r\npeople, which is being fulfilled today through an\r\nappropriate international presence. If the continuation of\r\nthat international presence is requested in due time by the\r\nhead of State of Haiti, my country will do everything\r\npossible in its capacity as a member of the group of Friends\r\nof the Secretary-General for Haiti to assist that country of\r\nmy region.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the sister Republic of Argentina on its\r\nillustrious election to the Security Council, as well as\r\nCanada, Malaysia, Namibia and the Netherlands, which will\r\nalso be members of the Council in the coming biennium.\r\nWe are sure that they will know how to continue the task\r\nof making the Security Council what we all desire it to be.\r\nMr. Lidén (Sweden): First of all, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador Jeremy\r\nGreenstock, for his presentation of this year’s report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThis annual debate is a welcome opportunity for the\r\nfull membership of the United Nations to take stock of the\r\nwork of the Security Council. My country attaches\r\nparticular importance to this opportunity.\r\nThe Security Council carries a heavy responsibility. It\r\nexercises this responsibility on behalf of all Members of the\r\nOrganization, and must be seen to do so. The highest\r\npossible degree of openness is a requirement in this regard.\r\nSweden has, for its part, tried to make openness and\r\ntransparency a hallmark of its present Security Council\r\nmembership. Openness is a significant goal in itself; but, in\r\nparticular, it is a means to promote broad consultations and\r\nto involve non-members of the Council in the work to\r\nprepare and implement Council decisions.\r\nThe format of the Security Council report before us\r\ndiffers, as has already been noted by other speakers, from\r\nthat of preceding years. An important new element is the\r\naddition of monthly assessments by the respective Council\r\nPresidents, the first of them, as it happens, having been\r\nprovided by Sweden. These assessments should try to meet\r\nthe need expressed by many States for a more analytical\r\nand succinct Council reporting. I trust that all Council\r\nmembers will carefully consider the views expressed\r\nduring today’s debate on this and other aspects of the\r\nreport.\r\nImproving the transparency and the working methods\r\nof the Council is an important issue of principle. It is not\r\na theoretical question, but one in which practical steps\r\nthat lead to concrete results can and should be taken.\r\nDuring its tenure on the Council, Sweden has argued and\r\nstriven consistently for such improvement. Non-members\r\nof the Council have the right to be well briefed about the\r\nwork of the Council. We continue to work for an\r\nimproved use of troop-contributor meetings as an\r\ninstrument to influence and inform Council decision-\r\nmaking. Statements by the President of the Council to the\r\npress should be readily available to the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations. During Sweden’s\r\npresidency of the Council a record was kept of daily\r\nactivities in the Council on the Mission’s Internet home\r\npage, which included statements to the press. The\r\nPresidency before us also made such statements public on\r\nthe Internet, and we hope that others will follow that\r\npractice.\r\nThis report of the Security Council covers an active\r\nand, in many respects, troublesome period. A number of\r\ncrises which have been on the Council’s agenda for a\r\nlong time have continued to call for the Council’s\r\nattention. In some cases they have been further\r\naggravated. At the same time, other issues have come to\r\nthe fore, such as the nuclear-test explosions by India and\r\nPakistan, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and\r\nthe aggravated situation in Kosovo. The past year has\r\nbeen a period of significant achievements for the Council,\r\nbut it has also been one of substantial difficulties in\r\ntackling a number of complex issues.\r\nFrom Sweden’s perspective, some particularly\r\nimportant highlights of the work of the Council over the\r\npast year deserve to be mentioned: first, the adoption of\r\na firm resolution on Kosovo setting out clear demands\r\nthat are now to be met under international control;\r\nsecondly, continued insistence on full Iraqi compliance\r\nwith Security Council resolutions, while the oil-for-food\r\nmechanism has been improved; thirdly, steps taken to\r\ndevelop a long-term strategy for peace and security in\r\nAfrica, together with African organizations and States;\r\nfourthly, Security Council support for nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament in the wake of India and\r\nPakistan’s nuclear testing; and fifthly, increased attention\r\nto international humanitarian and human rights law in the\r\ncontext of the responsibilities of the Security Council,\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nincluding through the strengthening of the two ad hoc\r\nTribunals.\r\nThe Security Council has followed through on major\r\npeacekeeping operations in all parts of the world and agreed\r\non necessary steps to develop their mandates in keeping\r\nwith changing circumstances. Since last year, two new\r\npeacekeeping operations have been established in Africa: in\r\nSierra Leone and the Central African Republic. These are\r\nconcrete examples of the Council’s willingness to exercise\r\nits responsibility for international peace and security.\r\nThe Security Council is becoming more conscious of\r\nthe need for a broad mix of personnel and the right balance\r\nin peacekeeping operations. Military, civilian police and\r\nother components must be better integrated. The\r\nappointment of special representatives of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in conflict situations, with the support of the\r\nCouncil, has proved a useful tool. That said, there is reason\r\nfor concern that sometimes Security Council deliberations\r\non peacekeeping are stymied by a narrow and short-term\r\nbudgetary approach. A penny-pinching or tardy Council\r\nweakens its own authority and often also that of the\r\nSecretary-General. It runs the risk sending an inadvertent\r\nmessage of lack of concern to the parties affected, and it\r\nruns counter to the general acknowledgement of the need\r\nfor early and preventive action.\r\nThere are of course situations in which fundamental\r\ndisagreements or competing interests, in particular between\r\npermanent members, will stall the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. Such situations are today fewer in number than\r\nbefore, but almost by definition significant when they\r\noccur. They affect the overall work of the Council, but,\r\nfortunately, there is also a general understanding on the\r\nneed to try to limit the damage they cause.\r\nIn many situations, it is clearly difficult for the\r\nSecurity Council to define an effective strategy. The\r\ninstruments available can seem ill-suited to some of today’s\r\ncomplex conflicts, in many ways domestic but with major\r\ncross-border aspects, sometimes with the participation of\r\nseveral parties with less than clear command structures or\r\npolitical objectives. In such situations, durable peace is\r\nrarely a straightforward result only of political leaders\r\nreaching an agreement to be implemented. Peace has to be\r\nestablished through a lengthy process of confidence-\r\nbuilding and the reconstruction of torn societies.\r\nBut such difficulties can never be an excuse for the\r\nSecurity Council not to play its part in earnest. The\r\nCouncil’s responsibilities impel it to act, when necessary by\r\nsetting a framework for other actors and factors to fulfil\r\ntheir roles.\r\nThe increasingly central role of regional\r\norganizations for peace and security is an important\r\ndevelopment with long-term implications. Such a role is\r\nand must be a result of the aspirations and the ability of\r\nthose organizations themselves. Regionalism should be by\r\ndesign and not by default, in the interest both of regional\r\norganizations and the United Nations. The mere fact that\r\nsomeone else is seized of a matter should not, however,\r\nmean that the Security Council may dispense with\r\nconsidering what it needs to do.\r\nThe Security Council’s ability to address difficult\r\nissues and to take action is largely a question of political\r\nwill and of leadership by all members of the Council. The\r\nelected members are essential in this regard, as they help\r\nbring further legitimacy to the work of the Council.\r\nThe permanent members are equally important in\r\nthat respect. If there is a sense in their permanency —\r\nbeyond political realism — it should be that it induces a\r\nlong-term perspective, consistency and a willingness to be\r\nbolder and to take on difficult and uncertain tasks that\r\nrequire staying power from the international community.\r\nThat type of leadership would, I am convinced, be\r\nwelcomed by the broad membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nOpenness and effectiveness should be interrelated\r\nobjectives for the Security Council. The actions of the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, and indeed\r\nthe United Nations system as a whole, must be mutually\r\nreinforcing. Responsibilities may differ, but not the\r\nvocation as set out by the Charter.\r\nMr. Guillén (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe are particularly grateful to the Security Council for\r\nthe report we have received and are considering today,\r\nand to the Permanent Representative of the United\r\nKingdom — the current President of the Security Council,\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock — for his clear and\r\ncomprehensive introduction of the report to the General\r\nAssembly, in keeping with the practice initiated earlier by\r\nBrazil during its presidency of the Security Council.\r\nWe interpret this introduction as an expression of the\r\nwill of the Council to establish a dialogue with the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in accordance with Article 24 of the\r\nCharter. This interaction and effective relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nis essential. The work of both organs must be mutually\r\nreinforcing because, although their responsibilities in the\r\narea of peace and security differ, their goal is a shared one,\r\nas set out in the Charter. The Assembly’s role is not limited\r\nto adopting resolutions on financial allocations for\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nWe welcome the ongoing efforts of the Council to\r\nimprove the content of the report and the measures taken to\r\nthat end. We welcome also the significant improvements\r\nthat were made, in particular the inclusion of background\r\ninformation with the list of decisions, resolutions and\r\npresidential statements adopted by the Council the previous\r\nyear; a description of the consideration given to each item\r\nin the course of the year; communications received by the\r\nCouncil; and reports of the Secretary-General submitted to\r\nthe Council.\r\nWe particularly appreciate the assessments of the work\r\nof the Security Council prepared under the responsibility of\r\nrepresentatives who have completed their functions as\r\nPresident, which are appended to the report. In this regard,\r\nwe are pleased to recall the initiative taken by the\r\nPermanent Representative of Portugal in April 1997, which\r\nestablished this practice.\r\nGiven the importance of these assessments, we believe\r\nthat it would be very useful to have them available as soon\r\nas each presidency is over, without having to wait until this\r\nreport is submitted. Such evaluations should be submitted\r\non behalf of the Security Council and should not be limited,\r\nas in some cases, to a mere summary of facts that appear\r\nin other parts of the report, without being accompanied by\r\nan assessment. In this regard and with a view to a careful\r\nstudy and analysis of the document in the General\r\nAssembly, it would be advisable that the Council not adopt\r\nits report two and a half months after the end of the period\r\ncovered in that report.\r\nGiven the frequent use of statements to the press by\r\nthe presidency of the Council, such statements should be\r\nrecorded in some manner in order to determine their\r\npolitical and legal value, since they stem from agreements\r\nthat are sometimes reached with difficulty by the members\r\nof the Council.\r\nIt has been proposed that States that are not members\r\nof the Council should be able, under Articles 31 and 32 of\r\nthe Charter of the Organization, to participate in meetings\r\nor consultations in which they are involved prior to the\r\nCouncil’s reaching a decision. In our view, this is a\r\nprecondition for according legitimacy to a given Council\r\ndecision. Of course, this also requires establishing a\r\nmechanism of timely notification and information.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s views on the\r\nproposal that the Security Council should resort to the\r\npower conferred on it in Article 65 of the Charter to\r\nobtain from the Economic and Social Council the\r\nnecessary information and assistance to enable it to\r\nconsider a specific situation in a more comprehensive and\r\neffective manner. We believe also that difficult\r\nagreements on peacekeeping in regions affected by\r\nconflicts could unravel in the absence of political,\r\neconomic and social stability. Hence these political\r\nagreements require a strategic convergence of economic\r\nand social cooperation projects, which should bring the\r\nSecurity Council closer not only to the Economic and\r\nSocial Council but also to other United Nations bodies as\r\nwell as financial institutions.\r\nIn the report of the Security Council now before the\r\nGeneral Assembly we can see both that the increase in\r\nserious crises within States calls for urgent measures,\r\nabove all of a humanitarian nature, and that the crises are\r\nbecoming ever larger. But something new has been\r\nadded: serious reluctance and indifference regarding\r\ninternational concerns. All of this together has produced\r\na vacuum that the Council members explicitly mentioned\r\nin the Charter are hardly willing to fill. All of this has\r\nradically transformed the import of the solemn statement\r\nof 31 January 1992 by the heads of State of the member\r\ncountries of the Security Council.\r\nPerhaps it is not necessary to repeat that the\r\nOrganization was not designed to deal with these new\r\nsituations, especially when a system of collective action\r\nsuch as the one provided for in the Charter was never\r\nestablished or implemented. However, generally\r\nspeaking — and therefore in relative terms — all efforts\r\nof the Council to deal with such cases deserve the\r\nconsideration of all Member States.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 41st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 October 1998\r\nThe information we have — not from the Security\r\nCouncil but glimpsed or guessed at from outside — gives\r\nthe impression that the new conflicts require actions clearly\r\nbacked by the authority of the Council, and in some cases\r\nalso by deterrence. At the same time, depending on the\r\ncase, in other situations operations should be deployed in\r\nthe field only on the basis of civilian, not military,\r\napproaches. Above all, operations must always be based on\r\nnot only the consent of but also the cooperation of the\r\nStates affected by the conflicts.\r\nTo a large extent the validity of the Security Council’s\r\nactions depends on its members’ accountability to all the\r\nMember States regarding the measures it takes on their\r\nbehalf and on the extent to which its decisions are based on\r\nthe Charter. This is because the Council is an essentially\r\npolitical organ operating under the Charter; its decisions\r\nwould not be legitimate in those cases where they exceeded\r\nthe Charter provisions or the norms of international law.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
