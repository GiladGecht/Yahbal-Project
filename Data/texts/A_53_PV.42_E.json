(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 7\r\nNotification by the Secretary-General under Article 12,\r\nparagraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/53/357)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): As\r\nmembers are aware, in accordance with the provisions of\r\nArticle 12, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United\r\nNations and with the consent of the Security Council, the\r\nSecretary-General is mandated to notify the General\r\nAssembly of matters relative to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security that are being dealt with by\r\nthe Security Council and of matters with which the Council\r\nhas ceased to deal.\r\nIn this connection, the General Assembly has before\r\nit a note by the Secretary-General issued as document\r\nA/53/357.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of that\r\ndocument?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 27\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLeague of Arab States\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/434)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.11)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Egypt to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.11.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIn my capacity as Chairman of the Arab Group for the\r\nmonth of October, I have the honour to submit, on behalf\r\nof the Arab delegations of Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti,\r\nJordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\r\nMauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan,\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates,\r\nYemen and Palestine, the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/53/L.11, under agenda item 27, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the League\r\nof Arab States”.\r\nThe League of Arab States is considered to be the\r\noldest regional organization in the world, because it was\r\nestablished in March 1945 — seven months before the\r\nfounding of the United Nations itself. The League is\r\nproud to be very closely linked with the United Nations.\r\nSuch a link is considered to be a real, tangible expression\r\nof the cooperation and coordination that are required\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nunder the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter between\r\nthe United Nations and regional arrangements. I would note\r\nhere that such links have been strengthened since the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session adopted by\r\nconsensus a resolution on cooperation between both\r\norganizations.\r\nThere is no doubt that at present we see that the\r\nrelationship between the two organizations is becoming\r\nmore diversified as far as joint cooperation is concerned.\r\nForemost among the issues of concern to the two\r\norganizations are matters related to international peace and\r\nsecurity. In this respect, we believe that there is an urgent\r\nneed to intensify cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States in order to\r\nachieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the\r\nMiddle East that will guarantee to the Palestinian people all\r\ntheir legitimate national rights, foremost among which is its\r\ninalienable right to establish its independent state. It will\r\nalso guarantee the rights of Syria and Lebanon to regain\r\ntheir occupied territories.\r\nFrom another perspective, the Arab States note with\r\nsatisfaction the reference in document A/53/434 to\r\ncooperation between the League and the various\r\norganizations and specialized agencies of the United\r\nNations system in the economic, social, developmental and\r\ntechnical fields, thereby benefiting all the member States of\r\nthe League. We also note that there are other areas and\r\ngreater opportunities for cooperation and coordination that\r\nshould be pursued further, especially at the technical level,\r\nin order to achieve the common objectives of the two\r\norganizations.\r\nIn the preamble to the draft resolution submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, certain paragraphs stress the aspiration\r\nof both organizations to consolidate the ties existing\r\nbetween them in various fields and their desire to continue\r\ncooperation in order to contribute to the promotion of the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\nIn the operative paragraphs of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly expresses its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the follow-up action taken by him to\r\nimplement the proposals adopted at the coordination\r\nmeetings between the two organizations over the last year.\r\nWe also request the Secretary-General to continue his\r\nefforts to strengthen the coordination between the two\r\norganizations and the agencies related to both of them.\r\nOperative paragraph 10 welcomes the results of the\r\nsectoral meeting on trade and development held in Cairo in\r\nJune 1998. Paragraph 12 reaffirms the importance of\r\nholding the next meeting on cooperation between the\r\nrepresentatives of the two secretariats during 1999, and a\r\nsectoral meeting on one of the areas of priority during the\r\nyear 2000.\r\nFinally, on behalf of the Arab Group, I should like\r\nto invite the General Assembly, which represents the\r\ninternational community, to support cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States through\r\nthe adoption by consensus of the draft resolution before\r\nus.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 477 (V), of\r\n1 November 1950, I now call on the observer of the\r\nLeague of Arab States.\r\nMr. Hassouna (League of Arab States)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): At the outset, allow me to\r\nextend to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of the fifty-third session of\r\nthe General Assembly. Your election to this lofty post\r\nbears witness to the trust we place in you and the\r\nappreciation of the international community for your\r\ncountry, Uruguay.\r\nThe League of Arab States came into being in\r\nMarch 1945 as the first regional organization within the\r\nframework of the new international order that was\r\nestablished following the Second World War. Cooperation\r\nbetween the League and the United Nations has\r\ndeveloped gradually and continuously, and as a result we\r\nhave accumulated considerable experience and achieved\r\nmajor objectives over the years. All of our experiences\r\nand achievements confirm the necessity and the\r\nimportance of intensification of our cooperation to ensure\r\ninternational peace and security and to serve the common\r\ninterests of both organizations, not only at the political\r\nlevel, but also at the economic, social, cultural and\r\nhumanitarian levels.\r\nIn this context, allow me to reaffirm the keenness of\r\nthe League of Arab States and its specialized agencies to\r\ncontinue and strengthen cooperation with the United\r\nNations in all fields. This was referred to in the report\r\nsubmitted by the United Nations Secretary-General to the\r\nAssembly today in document A/53/434. That report\r\ncontains the most important aspects of cooperation,\r\ncoordination, consultation and exchange of information\r\nbetween the League of Arab States and the United\r\nNations at all levels over the period covered.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General that we have\r\nbefore us states that consultations were pursued between the\r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the League\r\nof Arab States both during the last session of the General\r\nAssembly and during the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s visit to the Middle East in March 1998. At those\r\nmeetings, the two Secretaries-General discussed Arab issues\r\nof regional and international importance, such as the\r\nquestions of Iraq, Libya, Somalia and the Comoros, in\r\naddition to the Palestinian question and the peace process\r\nin the Middle East. Although they discussed those issues,\r\nin our view progress in efforts to contain or settle many of\r\nthese crises depend to a great extent on constructive\r\ncooperation and fruitful consultations between these two\r\nSecretaries-General, in fulfilment of the common objectives\r\nand interests of both the United Nations and the League of\r\nArab States.\r\nAt its last session, the General Assembly adopted a\r\nresolution to hold a sectoral meeting on the question of\r\ntrade and development — a priority area for the attainment\r\nof progress in economic and social development in the\r\nArab region — at the headquarters of the League of Arab\r\nStates in 1998. That meeting was quite successful, as it\r\nstressed the importance of giving impetus to international\r\nand regional cooperation in the area of trade and\r\ndevelopment. In this respect, account was taken of the\r\nefforts to set up an Arab free-trade zone, to develop inter-\r\nArab trade relations and to deal with the social and\r\neconomic consequences resulting from world economic\r\ntrends, while strengthening Arab economic potential with\r\nrespect to competitiveness in the world markets. This was\r\ndone in full awareness of the fact that the development\r\nambitions of the Arab States cannot be fully achieved\r\nexcept in an environment of stability, security and just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Arab region.\r\nFrom this rostrum, at the last session of the General\r\nAssembly, the League of Arab States expressed its\r\nappreciation and support for the Secretary-General’s report\r\non reform which, inter alia, affirmed the Organization’s\r\ndetermination to strengthen cooperation with regional\r\norganizations so that these organizations may increasingly\r\nbecome partners with the United Nations in all areas\r\nrelating to international peace and security and the\r\nprevention of conflicts. The League of Arab States\r\nparticipated in the third joint meeting between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, held at Headquarters on\r\n28 and 29 July 1998, on the question of cooperation to\r\nprevent conflicts. At that meeting, the League of Arab\r\nStates expressed its concept of how to strengthen\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations in this sphere. In this regard, it stressed\r\npreventive measures, including early warning systems,\r\npreventive diplomacy, preventive redeployment,\r\npreventive disarmament and peace-building on the basis\r\nof evolving economic and social capacities. We look\r\nforward to the meeting on follow-up, to be held by the\r\nrepresentatives of concerned organizations on 10 and 11\r\nDecember of this year, hoping that it might be possible\r\nthrough that meeting to set up new, practical mechanisms\r\nfor strengthening cooperation in conflict prevention\r\nmeasures. This would accomplish complementarity of\r\nundertakings by the various organizations in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter.\r\nDespite the increasing role and importance of the\r\nLeague of Arab States in endeavours relating to\r\ninternational peace and security, as has been reflected in\r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions, the\r\nLeague does not yet have recognition by the host country\r\nof United Nations Headquarters; nor has it been granted\r\nthe same full diplomatic status as other regional\r\norganizations in accordance with Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter. That recognition of diplomatic status for the\r\nLeague of Arab States and other, similar regional\r\norganizations, such as the Organization of African States\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference, would\r\nbolster the capacities of the Missions of those\r\norganizations, facilitating their tasks, and removing some\r\ncommon obstacles to the fulfilment of their\r\nresponsibilities in the host country. In this respect, we\r\nshould bear in mind that the League of Arab States, as\r\nwell as other regional organizations accredited to the\r\nEuropean headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva,\r\nare accorded full diplomatic status there. We are\r\nconvinced that the Government of the United States will\r\npay due attention to this question in light of the\r\ncomprehensive support for this just request by members\r\nof the League of Arab States, the Organization of African\r\nUnity and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nEfforts to resolve the Palestinian issue and to put an\r\nend to the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories\r\noccupied since 1967 is first among the priorities of the\r\nLeague of Arab States. We hope that present efforts to\r\ngive new impetus to this peace process will lead to\r\npositive results which would contribute to the attainment\r\nof a just and comprehensive settlement to the Middle East\r\nproblem.\r\nAt its last meeting the Council of the League of\r\nArab States, at the level of Ministers for Foreign Affairs,\r\nheld in September 1998, highlighted the importance of\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nsupporting the peace process on the basis of the resolutions\r\nof international legitimacy, in particular Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the land-for-peace\r\nprinciple and the right of the Palestinian people to self-\r\ndetermination and to the establishment of its independent\r\nState with Jerusalem as its capital. Moreover, the League’s\r\nCouncil stressed the need to implement Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978), which calls for the immediate and\r\nunconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied\r\nLebanese territory. The League also called on Israel to\r\nresume negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks\r\nfrom the point where they were stopped, more than two\r\nyears ago. The Council of the League of Arab States has\r\nalso called for the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 465 (1980), which declares the settlements\r\nestablished on occupied Arab land illegal and calls for the\r\ndismantling of these settlements. The Council of the League\r\nhas also stressed that all measures adopted by Israel to\r\nchange the geographic and demographic status of Jerusalem\r\nare null and void, in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolutions adopted in this regard. If the United Nations is\r\ntruly keen on respecting the bases of international\r\nlegitimacy, the rule of law and the commitment by all\r\nStates, without exception, to the observance of the\r\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter and the decisions\r\nof the Organization, the League of Arab States feels that it\r\nis high time Israel respected United Nations resolutions,\r\nparticularly those of the Security Council. These are\r\nresolutions which must be complied with by all States,\r\nwithout exception. Otherwise, the United Nations would\r\nallow itself to practise double standards and thereby lose its\r\ncredibility and efficiency.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm that our support for\r\nthe United Nations stems from the profound conviction of\r\nthe member States of the League of Arab States that there\r\nis a need to apply the principles, ideals and lofty goals of\r\nthe United Nations Charter. If is also based upon the\r\nLeague’s keen desire, as a regional organization, to have\r\nconstructive cooperation with the United Nations in all\r\nfields in order to promote common interests in the areas of\r\npeace and development. These issues are highlighted in the\r\ndraft resolution before the Assembly today, and I hope that\r\nit will be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We shall\r\nnow take a decision on draft resolution A/53/L.11.\r\nAt the last session of the General Assembly the draft\r\nresolution on this item was adopted without a vote.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.11?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.11 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/8).\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I shall\r\nnow call on the representative of Israel, who wishes to\r\nexplain a position on the resolution just adopted.\r\nMr. Gilon (Israel): The delegation of Israel has\r\njoined the consensus on the resolution on this item for the\r\nfifth time in a row. In so doing, we are guided by the\r\ndesire to make peace with our neighbours, all of which\r\nare members of the League of Arab States.\r\nToday there is new hope for progress on the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian track, and we continue to strive for progress\r\non the other tracks as well. The peace process, which\r\nbegan in Madrid in 1991, was, after all, based both on the\r\nbilateral tracks between Israel and its neighbours and on\r\nthe multilateral track.\r\nWe take this opportunity to call upon the Arab\r\nStates to resume participation on the multilateral track so\r\nthat progress can be made in the crucial areas covered by\r\nthis channel.\r\nPeace and economy go hand in hand. One follows\r\non the heels of the other. That is why Israel has continued\r\nto actively support the economy of the Palestinians in the\r\nterritories through a variety of policies, packages and\r\nprogrammes. For example, through courses provided by\r\nthe Centre for International Cooperation in the Ministry\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Israel trained some 700 Palestinians\r\nin 1997 alone in the fields of management, public health\r\nand agriculture.\r\nIsrael reiterates its support for increased efforts by\r\nArab States towards similarly supporting the Palestinian\r\neconomy, such as those undertaken by the European\r\nUnion, Norway, Japan and the United States. In this\r\ncontext, Israel supports cooperation between the United\r\nNations and various regional organizations, including the\r\nLeague of Arab States. Indeed, such cooperation is based\r\non provisions of the United Nations Charter.\r\nIt is therefore regrettable that Israel alone remains\r\nexcluded from the regional group fitting its geographic\r\nlocation, owing to the political objections of some\r\nMember States. Israel calls upon the members of the\r\nLeague of Arab States to honour Israel’s equal right to\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nparticipate in the Group of Asian States. The fact that Israel\r\nalone is still denied membership in any regional group\r\ndirectly contradicts the declared commitment of the United\r\nNations to sovereign equality of all its Members, as\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter.\r\nThis is the first resolution on an issue relating to the\r\nMiddle East to be adopted by the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-third session. We are pleased that the resolution was\r\nadopted by consensus. We therefore take this opportunity\r\nto recommend that all parties to the peace process exercise\r\nrestraint in both the language of resolutions to be submitted\r\nand all related statements. We cannot build confidence in\r\nthe Middle East by engaging in polemical debates in New\r\nYork. The peace process is, by its nature, bilateral between\r\nthe parties; inflammatory rhetoric offered in international\r\nforums surely belongs to another era.\r\nBy resolving today to promote in word and in deed an\r\natmosphere of cooperation and growth in the region, the\r\nnations involved in the peace process can transform today’s\r\nhope into tomorrow’s reality. Let us hope that they do not\r\nmiss this historic opportunity.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): May I\r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 27?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 21\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/272 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.10/Rev.1)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to the representative of Honduras to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.10/Rev.l.\r\nMr. Noé-Pino (Honduras) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation would like to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for submitting his report dated 17\r\nOctober 1998 on item 21 of the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly, “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization of American States”, in compliance with\r\nresolution 51/4 of 24 October 1996.\r\nThe Republic of Honduras is deeply honoured to\r\nintroduce to the Assembly the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/53/L.10/Rev.1, sponsored by the countries\r\nlisted therein and by those that joined later: the Bahamas,\r\nBelize, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Suriname\r\nand Uruguay.\r\nWithout any doubt, the new order of the\r\ninternational community requires ever closer cooperation\r\nbetween regional organizations and the United Nations. In\r\nthis respect, we recall resolution 47/11 of 29 October\r\n1992 relating to the promotion of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States\r\n(OAS). That resolution served as a basis for establishing,\r\nin the following years, such important international\r\nprogrammes as the Agenda for Peace, the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment and others of equal importance. All of these\r\nfall within the purposes espoused by the United Nations\r\nand the OAS, whose goals are to ensure international\r\ncooperation in seeking solutions to international\r\neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems, and\r\nin the development of and fostering of respect for\r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms.\r\nRecent efforts by these international organizations\r\nhave been very satisfactory in joint operations, such as in\r\nthe case of the Mission in Haiti and the support for\r\nHaiti’s legislative, municipal and presidential elections in\r\n1995, as well as in their participation in missions as\r\nelectoral observers — for example, on 20 October 1996\r\nin Nicaragua, where the United Nations system provided\r\ntechnical cooperation. Similarly, there have been joint\r\nefforts in the demining efforts in Central America and in\r\nthe initiatives to turn the western hemisphere into a zone\r\nfree of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOAS in their efforts to combat drug-trafficking marks a\r\nsignificant international development.\r\nIt is quite right to acknowledge the efforts carried\r\nout by the two Secretaries-General and the frequent\r\nmeetings of the representatives of the two organizations,\r\nwhich, happily, on 17 April 1995 signed an agreement for\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAS.\r\nThis year, in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nthe signing of the OAS Charter in Bogotá on 30 April\r\n1948, my delegation and other delegations representing\r\npeoples that cherish international peace and security\r\nwithin a framework of peaceful and harmonious\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\ncoexistence have expressed their best wishes for the well-\r\nbeing of that organization.\r\nThe conclusions of the eighth Ibero-American Summit,\r\nheld this month in the Portuguese city of Oporto, noted that\r\nnew pragmatic criteria are needed in order to find concrete\r\nsolutions. The dignitaries attending the Summit pointed out\r\nthat thinking based on merely rhetorical concepts is\r\nobsolete and that what is needed in the context of the\r\ncurrent economic crisis is for the international financial\r\ninstitutions to provide the necessary resources.\r\nThe sponsors of this draft resolution understand that,\r\non the threshold of the next millennium, cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations is essential if we hope to attain higher\r\nlevels of development. We should promote the launching of\r\nnew programmes and the exchange of information,\r\nespecially between the United Nations economic and social\r\nagencies and the Organization of American States, in the\r\ncontext of the Programme of Action for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. We must also continue to support the work\r\nundertaken by the Organization of American States in the\r\nfield of regional cooperation.\r\nThe particular political circumstances of the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean region, the consolidation of its\r\ndemocracies, progress in its relations with the United\r\nNations, and mutual respect for the good-faith fulfilment of\r\ncommitments undertaken by both organizations in the\r\nformal international legal framework have led us, a group\r\nof friendly and fraternal countries, to submit this draft\r\nresolution to the General Assembly today. We hope that it\r\nwill be adopted.\r\nMrs. Alvarez (Dominican Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): In its capacity as Chairman of the Group of\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, the Dominican\r\nRepublic endorses the draft resolution entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States”, contained in document A/53/L.10/Rev.1.\r\nNow that the cold war is over, the United Nations\r\nmust give priority to the eradication of poverty, sustainable\r\nhuman development and equal rights for men and women\r\nin order to bring human rights fully into force. Similarly,\r\nthe United Nations, which is characterized by pluralism and\r\ndemocracy, is a perfect tool for promoting a new world\r\norder in which the rights to development and peace can be\r\nrealized. Everything points to the fact that, in the coming\r\ncentury, the international system will be marked by\r\nincreased globalization and that such problems as\r\nunemployment, corruption and the lack of education will,\r\nby their very nature, be solvable only at the world level.\r\nIn this context, it is essential to strengthen relations\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and subregional\r\norganizations, in particular the Organization of American\r\nStates (OAS), and regional and subregional economic\r\nintegration instruments, to which the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean countries attach great importance.\r\nIn his report, contained in document A/53/272 and\r\naddendum 1, the Secretary-General stresses that the need\r\nfor increased cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations has never been greater, while\r\nrecognizing that no single model of cooperation will\r\ncover all eventualities. Nevertheless, it is encouraging for\r\nour countries to note that various avenues of cooperation\r\nhave been considered, reflecting the particular fields and\r\ncapacities of various organizations.\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution\r\n51/4, among the joint activities of the United Nations and\r\nthe OAS, the International Civilian Mission to Haiti\r\ncontinues to be the principal expression of close\r\ncooperation between the two organizations. More\r\nspecifically, in the past two years, the United Nations has\r\nparticipated actively in our region, coordinating with the\r\nOAS various assistance programmes, such as the\r\nconference on “Governance, Democracy and Civil Society\r\nin the Caribbean Community”; the Colloquium on the\r\nInternational Protection of Refugees in Central America,\r\nPanama and Mexico, at which the Cartagena Declaration\r\non Refugees was adopted; the International Conference on\r\nCentral American Refugees; and the San José Declaration\r\non Refugees and Displaced Persons.\r\nMoreover, OAS civil servants are taking increasing\r\npart in forums organized by the Economic Commission\r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean and vice versa, as\r\nwell as in an exchange of information, in particular in the\r\narea of social policy, statistics and regional integration.\r\nParticular mention should be made of the research\r\nprogrammes undertaken in Argentina, Brazil, Chile,\r\nColombia and Paraguay for the joint programme on social\r\npolicies for Latin America to identify, systematize and\r\npropose strategies and policy tools for increasing the\r\nefficiency and impact of social programmes.\r\nThe strengthening of contacts and regional\r\ncooperative relations between the United Nations and the\r\nOAS, in the context of the work of the United Nations\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme and the Inter-\r\nAmerican Commission for the Control of Drug Abuse, has\r\nbeen undertaken within a policy of mutual support and\r\nexchange of information and technical assistance. The\r\nUnited Nations and the OAS have also cooperated within\r\nthe framework of the technical cooperation programme\r\nundertaken by the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights. I should also mention the informal contacts\r\nbetween the World Food Programme, the OAS and the\r\nCaribbean Community.\r\nThe countries members of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States understand that, on the\r\nbasis of regional cooperation, the United Nations can\r\nrespond effectively to the complex mandate of these new\r\ntimes.\r\nIt is therefore essential for Member States to renew\r\nour political commitment to the Organization’s future. The\r\nLatin American and Caribbean region hopes that the\r\nmechanisms for cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand our regional body will continue to be strengthened, in\r\nongoing respect for the mandate, functions and legal\r\nframework of the Organization of American States\r\nenshrined in Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. In\r\nthis way, we will be displaying a pluralist and open spirit,\r\nexpressed in collective regional cooperation, as manifested\r\nin the draft resolution we have submitted to the Assembly.\r\nWe hope it can be adopted without a vote.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): The 14 members of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) Members of the United\r\nNations fully support draft resolution A/53/L.10/Rev.1,\r\nwhich has just been presented by the Ambassador of\r\nHonduras to the General Assembly for adoption. We hope\r\nthat, with its passage, cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of American States (OAS)\r\nwill be further enhanced.\r\nCARICOM recalls with satisfaction that the first joint\r\nmission between the United Nations and a regional\r\norganization, the OAS, was a successful experiment. It\r\ndemonstrated that the world Organization and regional\r\narrangements could come together as envisaged in Chapter\r\nVIII of the United Nations Charter to promote peace and\r\nsecurity in areas of potential conflict. The joint United\r\nNations-OAS International Civilian Mission in Haiti has\r\ngone further to advance democracy, human rights and\r\neconomic and social reconstruction for that country’s\r\npeople. CARICOM is proud of its own contribution to this\r\ncollaborative effort and remains committed to Haiti’s\r\ndevelopment within our family of nations.\r\nWe were equally pleased to support resolution 51/4,\r\nwhich amplifies the areas of cooperation between the two\r\ninstitutions concerned. We know that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and the Secretary-General\r\nof the OAS meet from time to time to discuss their\r\nmutual interest in, inter alia, conflict prevention, good\r\ngovernance, democracy, human rights and the\r\nstrengthening of civil society in our region. Such\r\nmeetings, we believe, can serve to strengthen the role and\r\neffectiveness of the two organizations in advancing peace\r\nand development throughout the hemisphere.\r\nAlthough the Caribbean region has fortunately not\r\nsuffered from the same devastating effects of conflicts\r\nthat other regions have experienced, we are certainly not\r\nso complacent as to believe that we are immune from\r\nthreats to our welfare. Accordingly, we fully support the\r\nuse of such instruments as preventive diplomacy, peace-\r\nbuilding measures and the rule of law to guarantee our\r\nprogress. Also, since the roots of conflict lie mainly in\r\npoor economic and social conditions, we are concerned to\r\nsee greater international and institutional cooperation to\r\nremove these impediments from our societies.\r\nAt a conference on governance, democracy and civil\r\nsociety in the Caribbean, jointly sponsored by the OAS,\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\r\nCARICOM and the Inter-American Development Bank\r\n(IDB) and held last year in Barbados, the United Nations\r\nwas brought into closer recognition of the particular\r\nconditions and needs of our subregion. We would like to\r\nthink that that encounter provided a new impetus to our\r\ncollective efforts to position our small nations to better\r\nface the challenges which a new era in international\r\nrelations has brought.\r\nIn this context, we welcome increasing cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OAS to involve such\r\nrelevant institutions as the World Bank, the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), the World Food Programme, the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),\r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the\r\nLatin American Economic System (SELA) and the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC), to name a few.\r\nTwo priority areas in functional cooperation for the\r\nCaribbean are drug control and sustainable development.\r\nWe therefore hope that the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme (UNDCP) and the Inter-\r\nAmerican Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) will\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\ncontinue to consult and coordinate their activities to reduce\r\nthe deleterious impact of drug abuse and drug trafficking on\r\nour small and vulnerable societies. In the second area,\r\nsustainable development, we encourage fully a closer and\r\ncooperative relationship between the Department of\r\nEconomic and Social Affairs and the OAS to fully\r\nimplement the Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. The\r\nsuccess of the Barbados Programme of Action is critical to\r\nreaching the developmental goals of the Caribbean.\r\nIt has been said, and rightly so, that often the most\r\nvaluable asset for small developing States such as our own\r\nis our human resources. Not surprisingly, at the second\r\nSummit of the Americas, held in April this year, heads of\r\nState or Government decided to give priority to education.\r\nWe in the Caribbean are fully persuaded of the need to\r\ntrain our young people to become productive citizens not\r\nonly of our own countries but of the world. We would\r\ntherefore like to see in the continuing programme of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAS more\r\nemphasis placed on the major area of human resource\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWith these remarks I wish, on behalf of the\r\nCARICOM group of States, to commend resolution\r\nA/53/L.10/Rev.1 for unanimous adoption by this Assembly.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In\r\naccordance with resolution 253 (III) of 16 October 1948, I\r\nnow call on the Observer for the Organization of American\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Kaufman (Organization of American States)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): On behalf of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization of American States, Mr. César\r\nGaviria, and of the OAS Assistant Secretary-General,\r\nAmbassador Christopher R. Thomas, who is present and\r\nsends a special greeting to you, Sir, I should like to extend\r\nto members of the Assembly my warm greetings and\r\ngratitude for the appropriate and efficient way in which the\r\ncoordination activities between the two organizations were\r\ncarried out in the previous biennium.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS) has been taking\r\nplace through many years of sustained interaction in various\r\nspheres of regional cooperation.\r\nIn the General Assemblies of both organizations,\r\nresolutions have been adopted in which it has been agreed\r\nthat cooperation activities have been and are of great\r\nimportance, always emphasizing the need to reaffirm\r\nexisting commitments between both institutions.\r\nCooperation between the two organizations was defined\r\nin the Collaboration Agreement signed by the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral in April 1995, which formalized a fruitful\r\nrelationship, confirming once again that the\r\ncomplementarity between the international organizations\r\nis not only possible but productive and therefore\r\nnecessary.\r\nThe General Assembly of the OAS held recently in\r\nCaracas adopted a resolution on the question of\r\ncooperation between the OAS and the United Nations\r\nwhich once again recommended the continuation and\r\nstrengthening of cooperation activities as well as\r\nincreased inter-sectoral contacts among those responsible\r\nfor technical areas in the United Nations and the OAS, in\r\naccordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement\r\nsigned by both organizations.\r\nJoint activities carried out in the past two years\r\nreflect the diversity of issues in which the OAS and the\r\nUnited Nations have been involved. The International\r\nCivilian Mission in Haiti (MICIVIH), which was jointly\r\nsponsored by the two organizations, has worked\r\nintensively to create appropriate conditions for the\r\nrestoration of peace and democracy in that nation. The\r\nconfiguration of a mutual consultation system between the\r\nOAS and the United Nations on this problem has been\r\nimproved and has borne fruit, which both organizations\r\nbelieve lays the foundations for future activity in the\r\nregion.\r\nWith regard to conservation of the environment and\r\nsustainable development, the United Nations and OAS\r\ntogether made significant contributions during the Summit\r\nof the Americas on Sustainable Development held\r\nrecently in Bolivia. At that Summit they decided on the\r\nchallenges of development in Latin America in the\r\ncoming years and identified the main urban problems that\r\nwill be the subject of future joint activity. They also\r\nadopted mandates for the OAS and various United\r\nNations bodies to implement measures to improve\r\nstandards of living and environmental conditions\r\nthroughout the region.\r\nWith regard to natural disasters, the OAS has\r\nworked with the United Nations to reduce vulnerability to\r\nnatural disasters, and in this case we have also had the\r\nsupport and cooperation of multilateral bodies such as the\r\nWorld Bank and the World Health Organization. The\r\nOAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\ncooperating on an ongoing basis with the United Nations.\r\nThe Working Group on Indigenous Populations and the\r\nSubcommission on the rights of minorities have been of\r\nparticular interest to both institutions. The OAS Inter-\r\nAmerican Commission of Women (CIM) was invited to\r\ncome to the United Nations to participate in an inter-\r\nAmerican consultation group on the participation of women\r\nin the decision-making process, a meeting that took place\r\nat the beginning of the year.\r\nMany other activities have been the subject of joint\r\nwork between the OAS and the United Nations, such as\r\nelectoral monitoring and strengthening democratic\r\ninstitutions. In the area of education, science and culture,\r\nboth organizations are cooperating in creating an\r\ninternational network of institutions to train specialized\r\nteachers.\r\nAlso of interest to both organizations are other\r\nactivities such as those carried out by the Inter-American\r\nCommission for the Control of Drug Abuse and by the\r\nInter-American Children’s Institute, programmes on labour\r\nand employment, and cultural issues.\r\nThe Organization of American States is pleased with\r\nthe results of many years of multilateral and regional\r\ncooperation — especially this year, when the OAS is to\r\nmark its fiftieth anniversary. On the eve of the new\r\nmillennium, the OAS looks forward to that anniversary with\r\nthe hope and expectation that we will be able to provide all\r\nthe citizens of the hemisphere with continued fruitful\r\nactivity in areas that are of high priority for our member\r\ncountries. The agenda of the OAS for the coming years,\r\nalways in coordination with the United Nations and other\r\nregional and international organizations, is founded on\r\nmandates reflecting the will of member countries and is\r\nfocused on increasing unified action on the continent.\r\nThrough restructuring and administrative\r\nmodernization, the Organization of American States is\r\nready to engage in more meaningful and direct activities in\r\nthe region — again, with the support of organizations such\r\nas the United Nations. Our association with that\r\nOrganization over the years has proven to be of importance.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.10/Rev.1. In that connection, I wish to\r\nannounce that Canada and Peru have become sponsors of\r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nI call on the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Jin Yongian: Should the General Assembly\r\nadopt draft resolution A/53/L.10/Rev.1, there will be no\r\nprogramme budget implications.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): May\r\nI take it that the General Assembly wishes to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.10/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.10/Rev.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 53/9).\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): May\r\nI take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 21?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 25\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/420)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In\r\nconnection with this item, I wish to inform members that\r\nI have received a letter dated 19 October 1998 from the\r\nPermanent Representative of Peru, in which he indicates\r\nthat the States members of the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem do not intend to submit a draft resolution under\r\nagenda item 25 during the fifty-third session. They\r\nrequest that the item be considered at the fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, and it is their intention\r\nto submit at that session a draft resolution under that\r\nitem.\r\nMay I take it, then, that it is the wish of the\r\nAssembly to defer consideration of agenda item 25,\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nLatin American Economic System”, to the fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the Assembly and to include it in the\r\nprovisional agenda of that session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): This\r\nconcludes our consideration of agenda item 25.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/53/2)\r\nMr. Mahugu (Kenya): As Kenya approaches the end\r\nof its two-year tenure in the Security Council, which will\r\nconclude in December, my delegation welcomes the report\r\nof the Security Council (A/53/2) for the period 16 June\r\n1997 to 15 June 1998. I would also like to thank the\r\ncurrent President of the Security Council, my colleague Sir\r\nJeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom, for introducing\r\nthe report and for addressing some issues which continue to\r\nrequire the Council’s close attention.\r\nThe annual submission of the Security Council report,\r\nand discussion of it by all the Members of the United\r\nNations, provide a useful opportunity for all nations not\r\nonly to address the substantive issues which continue to be\r\nthe focus of the Security Council’s work, but also to\r\ncritically analyse the Council’s methods of work. That\r\nassessment enables the Council to examine itself and,\r\nheeding the advice of Member States, to make appropriate\r\nadjustments to its work methods and to the way in which\r\nit addresses security issues confronting it. In our two-year\r\ntenure, we have seen the concrete implementation of ideas\r\nand suggestions advanced in this annual analysis by\r\nMember States. However, more work needs to be done, and\r\nwe are encouraged that Member States continue to air their\r\nopinions on the work of the Security Council, because the\r\nCouncil, as a dynamic institution, can only benefit when it\r\nis exposed to the oxygen of ideas.\r\nMy delegation finds that this year’s report is well\r\nstructured and that it incorporates additional improvements\r\nwhich make it easier to digest. The monthly assessments by\r\nsuccessive presidencies of the Council during the reporting\r\nperiod add an insider’s flavour and incorporate a dimension\r\nof transparency consistent with the Council’s stated\r\nobjectives. Although this innovation is an improvement, the\r\nairing and exposure of issues to the general membership\r\ncontinues to be constrained by the tradition of over-\r\nconfidentiality that sometimes shrouds the informal\r\nconsultations. Indeed, issues of immense importance are\r\nraised, addressed and disposed of in these “informal”\r\nsettings, allowing only a final, ready-cooked product to be\r\nshown to the general membership. While there are\r\noccasions when such an approach is appropriate, allowing\r\nmore meetings, including briefing meetings, to be open to\r\nall Members would on balance be a definite plus. Sadly,\r\nwhen meetings are open, they are sometimes not well\r\nattended, and participation is limited. However, we believe\r\nthat discussion of how to strike a happy balance between\r\nthose opposing tendencies can define an acceptable way\r\nforward.\r\nOther innovations which have evolved in the\r\nmethods of work of the Security Council are the official\r\ndistribution of the Council’s work programme for the\r\nmonth and the circulation by the presidency of a tentative\r\nprovisional monthly work schedule. The former is now in\r\nplace and needs no further discussion. The latter,\r\nhowever, merits some comment. The informal working\r\ngroup of the Security Council concerning the Council’s\r\ndocumentation and other procedural questions agreed that\r\na provisional monthly work schedule would be circulated\r\nby each presidency. Although this has been faithfully\r\ncarried out by some, it may be proving to be slightly\r\nmore difficult to institutionalize this practice. In order to\r\nfirmly root this practice, the tentative provisional schedule\r\nas well should be circulated as an official document after\r\nit has been approved by the Council, even though it is\r\nrecognized that it is still tentative and subject to change.\r\nIn addition, after each presidency the final work schedule\r\nthat the Council has waded through for that month could\r\nbe incorporated as part of the documentation that will\r\nappear in the annual report, together with the monthly\r\nassessment. This proposal can be taken up by the working\r\ngroup.\r\nThe ability of the Council to pronounce itself\r\nimmediately on burning issues of the day directly related\r\nto its mandate is a feature that continues to be relevant\r\nand has to be nourished. Although the formal instruments\r\navailable to the Council are well known, and some are\r\neven enshrined in the Charter, their immediate use when\r\ncrises erupt is often constrained by lengthy negotiations.\r\nStatements to the press by the President have therefore\r\nproved to be effective tools available to the Council to\r\nimmediately share its perspective on an issue with the\r\ngeneral membership, but especially with the public at\r\nlarge. This enables the public to know that the Council is\r\nseized of a matter, thereby signalling the trend of possible\r\nfuture action. Naturally, because of their utility and speed,\r\nstatements to the press can, in the proper hands, be very\r\neffective instruments of the Security Council and can\r\ntherefore be the object of intense and sometimes\r\nprotracted negotiations in the Council. Moreover, with the\r\nmedia tending to give more coverage to the national\r\nsecurity concerns that are of importance to more powerful\r\nStates, statements to the press by the presidencies of these\r\nnations are exposed to more coverage. This is not\r\ncompletely the fault of the media, but the result is that\r\nsecurity issues of great concern to some of these nations\r\ninvariably get aired more frequently than others. A new\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nrelationship between the media and the rotatingpresidencies\r\nof the Council therefore needs to be structured to alter this\r\nsomewhat unfortunate reality.\r\nI would like to say a word about troop-contributing\r\ncountry meetings. These are organized in conjunction with\r\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations to exchange\r\ninformation with troop-contributing countries on operations\r\nin which their troops are on mission. Although individual\r\nnational problems are resolved at the Secretariat level and\r\nthe meetings tend to be formal, we have found such\r\nmeetings quite useful and relevant, and we encourage their\r\ncontinuation. As much as possible, we urge that the\r\nmeetings be held prior to the Security Council consultations\r\nregarding the conflict area for which the respective\r\npeacekeeping operations have been established.\r\nNearly 22 months have gone by since Kenya was\r\nelected to the Security Council. We had hoped that by the\r\ntime we left the Council the number of agenda items on\r\nAfrica would have been reduced, thus signalling the\r\nbeginning of a genuine African renaissance. Unfortunately,\r\nthe conflicts in Africa have not only increased, but have\r\nalso mutated into even more complex crises. In our view,\r\nthere are four categories of African conflict situations\r\nbefore the Council: first, crises that have been resolved, so\r\nthat post-conflict, peace-building issues prevail; secondly,\r\ncrises that are hopefully close to being resolved; thirdly,\r\ncrises that refuse to go away; and fourthly, new and\r\nmutated peace and security problems.\r\nIn the first category, Liberia’s crisis has been resolved,\r\nand post-conflict, peace-building issues dominate. We\r\nencourage the Secretary-General and his Special\r\nRepresentative to continue their efforts there under the\r\naegis of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia.\r\nIn the second category, we had hoped that Sierra\r\nLeone would soon join the first category of nations.\r\nUnfortunately, the rebels have increased their onslaught and\r\natrocities against the people of Sierra Leone. We encourage\r\nthe international community to make available even more\r\nlogistical support to the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States Monitoring Group to enable it to finish up\r\nthe job. However, in this second category, thankfully, the\r\nsituation in the Central African Republic is stabilizing with\r\nthe help of the United Nations Mission in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic; and with elections imminent and national\r\nreconciliation on track, there is some hope.\r\nIn the third category — crises that refuse to go\r\naway — there is Angola, among other countries. UNITA’s\r\nassault on the Lusaka Protocol and its refusal to extend\r\nState administration has brought the peace process to its\r\nknees.\r\nThe fourth and last category — the new and mutated\r\nconflicts — is unfortunately growing in size. This\r\ncategory includes the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nthe Ethiopia-Eritrea border dispute and Guinea-Bissau.\r\nRegional efforts aimed at resolving these conflicts\r\nare active and serious and need to be given maximum\r\nsupport by the Security Council and the international\r\ncommunity. In this regard, I would like to inform the\r\nAssembly that on Sunday, 18 October 1998, an East\r\nAfrican Cooperation Consultative Summit took place on\r\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in\r\nmy capital city of Nairobi and was chaired by President\r\nDaniel arap Moi. The Summit, whose communiqué has\r\nbeen circulated as an official document of the Security\r\nCouncil under the symbol S/1998/970 of 19 October\r\n1998, makes the following proposals. First, it calls for an\r\nimmediate cessation of hostilities. Secondly, it calls for\r\nnegotiations for a ceasefire agreement and a troop\r\nstandstill. Thirdly, it urges that adequate measures be\r\ntaken to address the security concerns of neighbouring\r\ncountries. Fourthly, it urges that the security of\r\nmarginalized groups be addressed. Fifthly, it calls for an\r\norderly withdrawal of foreign troops. Sixthly, it calls for\r\nthe initiation of an all-inclusive political dialogue. Finally,\r\nit calls for the emplacement of a neutral, international\r\npeacekeeping force under the auspices of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations.\r\nThe Summit also supported ongoing regional\r\nmediation efforts being carried out by the member States\r\nof the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) in consultation with the OAU and the United\r\nNations. In this regard, we are encouraged to learn that\r\nanother mediation conference under the aegis of SADC\r\nwill take place in Lusaka, Zambia, on 26 October 1998.\r\nIt is only through the vibrant coordination of efforts\r\nbetween the region and the United Nations that a just and\r\nlasting peace can be achieved in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo.\r\nAlthough most of the agenda items that the Security\r\nCouncil has on its plate are African, the focus and the\r\nallocation of resources to cope with these crises continues\r\nto be non-African. Even if there may be a tidy\r\njustification for this, my delegation would like to see the\r\nstriking of a balance that allows for a realistic reallocation\r\nof focus and resource distribution that conforms to the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nSecurity Council’s Charter-based primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nAs Kenya prepares to leave the Security Council at the\r\nend of this year, the weight of these imbalances continues\r\nto press on our collective conscience. Naturally, we hope\r\nthat they will be noticed, addressed and, indeed, resolved.\r\nMay I, in this context, take this opportunity to again\r\ncongratulate the brotherly country of Namibia and the other\r\nfour newly elected members of the Council — Argentina,\r\nCanada, Malaysia and the Netherlands. I wish them success\r\nand extend Kenya’s complete support and cooperation as\r\nthey work to make the Council more effective and, indeed,\r\ndemocratic.\r\nI must also take this opportunity to thank the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his hard-working\r\nstaff for continuing to be at the forefront of all peace and\r\nsecurity issues. I also wish to thank him for his support on\r\nAfrican issues and to encourage him to continue doing his\r\nexcellent work, in the hope that the attention he gives to\r\nthese problems will bring forth a rich harvest of peace,\r\nsecurity and prosperity.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): I wish to thank the President\r\nof the Security Council for his clear and concise\r\nintroduction of the Council’s report (A/53/2) covering the\r\nperiod 16 June 1997 to 15 June 1998.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the consideration of the\r\nCouncil’s report, as this constitutes an exceptional occasion\r\nfor necessary dialogue and interaction between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, as both organs of the\r\nUnited Nations seek solutions to the problems facing the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMy delegation has carefully examined the contents of\r\nthis year’s report and is pleased to note that there are\r\nseveral improvements over last year’s. The improvements\r\nintroduced can be acknowledged as a positive development\r\nfrom the point of view of the enhancement of transparency\r\nand accountability of the Council’s work.\r\nWe welcome the incorporation in the report of the\r\nmonthly assessments as an important step in the direction\r\nof a more analytical report. The combination of views of\r\nthe various Presidents during the period has certainly\r\nassisted in broadening the perspective on the work of the\r\nCouncil. We also note that briefings continue to be\r\nprovided to non-members of the Council, following\r\ninformal meetings, and we would urge that these briefings\r\nbe institutionalized and expanded to serve as a greater\r\nsource of information on the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMy delegation notes with concern that the period\r\ncovered by the current report has been one of mixed\r\nresults in terms of the capacity of the Security Council to\r\ndeal effectively with the different sources of instability\r\naround the world.\r\nWhile there have been some notable successes, there\r\ncontinue to be conflicts which undermine the political,\r\neconomic and social fabric of the States concerned,\r\nbringing destruction and untold suffering to the victims of\r\nwar. The increases in attacks and the use of force against\r\nrefugees and other civilians, particularly women and\r\nchildren in conflict situations, also pose a direct challenge\r\nto the resolve of the international community.\r\nIt is against this background that my delegation\r\nwelcomes the public debates held by the Security Council\r\nduring the last year on the protection of humanitarian\r\nassistance to refugees and others in conflict situations as\r\nwell as on the impact of armed conflict on children.\r\nMy delegation remains perturbed that Security\r\nCouncil resolutions have not been adhered to by several\r\nparties, thus thwarting the ability of the Council to\r\neffectively maintain control of ongoing conflicts. In this\r\nregard, I wish to underscore the importance which my\r\ndelegation attaches to the Security Council as the\r\nprincipal authority for multilateral decision-making in\r\nmatters affecting international peace and security. We\r\ntherefore reiterate our concern at the tendency of States\r\nto take unilateral action which they deem to be in their\r\nnational interest in situations of conflict with other\r\nnations. Jamaica reaffirms its confidence in the principle\r\nof collective security, on which the role of the Security\r\nCouncil is predicated.\r\nIn addition to the substance of the report, my\r\ndelegation attaches great importance to reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. In this regard, we commend the efforts\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council in the conduct of its\r\nextensive discussions. These discussions have generated\r\nmany concrete ideas and proposals pertaining to the\r\ndecision-making process of the Council as well as to its\r\nstructure, which could contribute to making the Council\r\nmore efficient and effective.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nWe are disappointed that further progress has not been\r\nachieved and that the realization of the reform of the\r\nCouncil remains a distant hope.\r\nThe Security Council is vital to the functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations. It is therefore essential for its effectiveness\r\nthat it command the confidence of the international\r\ncommunity. Jamaica supports an expansion of membership\r\nwhich would make the Security Council more representative\r\nof the Member States it serves. We also advocate the\r\nadoption of further procedures which would make the\r\nCouncil more democratic and transparent in its decision-\r\nmaking. In this connection, we were pleased to note the\r\nposition paper on the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil attached to the monthly assessment by the\r\npresidency of Costa Rica for December 1997. We hope that\r\nthese proposals will be institutionalized.\r\nMr. Cho (Republic of Korea): My delegation\r\nwelcomes today’s opportunity to deliberate on the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly. We\r\nconsider this practice to be an important step forward in\r\nensuring closer collaboration and coordination between the\r\ntwo principal United Nations organs sharing the\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe appreciate the steady efforts made by the members\r\nof the Security Council and the Secretariat to make the\r\nreport more user-friendly and substantive. We also join\r\nothers in thanking the President of the Council, the\r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom, for his\r\nuseful introductory remarks.\r\nIt is indeed difficult to pursue transparency and\r\nefficiency at the same time. But these two concepts\r\ncomplement each other. In this age of information, it goes\r\nwithout saying that the efficiency of any organization\r\ndepends to a large extent upon how adequately information\r\nis internally shared. However, the degree of information-\r\nsharing relies heavily upon the extent of transparency\r\nwithin the organization. Therefore, we are of the view that\r\nefficiency and transparency can and should be pursued in\r\ntandem within the United Nations.\r\nHaving said that, in my comments today I will focus\r\nmainly on the issue of ensuring greater transparency in the\r\nwork of the Security Council, which is essential to\r\nenhancing closer interaction and collaboration between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, which is\r\nenvisaged also in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMy first point relates to the need to ensure greater\r\nsubstantiveness and analytical depth to the annual report.\r\nIn this regard, we note with satisfaction that\r\nimprovements were made this year, as for the first time\r\nmonthly assessments by the presidency were attached as\r\nan addendum to the report. This is a welcome step\r\nforward. These monthly assessments serve as a useful\r\ncomplement to the report and enable the outgoing\r\nPresident to provide an individual view on the work of\r\nthe Security Council for every month in a more\r\nsubstantive way. For this reason, the Republic of Korea,\r\nupon completion of its presidency of the Council in May\r\nlast year, took the voluntary initiative to introduce the\r\nnew practice of preparing and distributing monthly\r\nassessments.\r\nWe commend the efforts of all those delegations that\r\nprovided comprehensive monthly assessments in the\r\nattachment to the report. Moreover, we welcome the\r\ninitiatives to distribute the assessments to the general\r\nmembership as an official document immediately\r\nfollowing their issuance. These are concrete steps\r\ncontributing to the improvement of the historical\r\ntransparency of the Council’s work. It is our sincere hope\r\nthat they will continue to be further built upon.\r\nAnother related issue is transparency in the work of\r\nthe subsidiary organs of the Security Council, including\r\nthe sanctions committees. Recently, a number of\r\ntransparency measures, such as the Chairman’s briefings\r\nto non-members, have been introduced. We also note that\r\nthis year’s report contains information regarding the work\r\nof the subsidiary organs. This is a positive improvement\r\non last year’s report, which contained only the dates of\r\nthe meetings of the subsidiary organs. But we believe that\r\nmore can be done. We are of the view that decisions\r\nand/or the relevant parts of the summaries of the\r\nproceedings of subsidiary organs should promptly be\r\nmade available to non-members of the Council, as long as\r\nthey do not compromise the confidentiality of the work of\r\nthe organs. We further believe that such information\r\nregarding the substantive work of the subsidiary organs,\r\nin particular the sanctions committees, should be included\r\nin the annex of the annual report of the Council.\r\nNow allow me to turn to a subject related to the\r\nreal-time transparency of the Council. In the report we\r\nnoted some positive developments in the expanded use of\r\norientation debates or open, public meetings on certain\r\nregional or thematic issues. But many delegations,\r\nincluding my own, believe that more needs to be done in\r\nthis regard. These open meetings provide the members of\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nthe Security Council with useful opportunities to hear the\r\nviews of non-members and concerned international\r\norganizations at the beginning of the consideration of the\r\nissue by the Council. The open format of these meetings is\r\nitself the best guarantor of the real-time transparency of the\r\nCouncil, as it allows all interested non-members to have\r\nfirst-hand observation of what is transpiring in Council\r\ndeliberations.\r\nWith this in mind, in May of last year my delegation\r\norganized the first open debate on protection for\r\nhumanitarian assistance to refugees and others in conflict\r\nsituations. We also welcome the recent follow-up open\r\ndebate on the issue, organized by Sweden last month, as\r\npart of a laudable pattern of displaying the continuing\r\ninterest of the Council in this issue of global concern.\r\nWe share the widely held view that the Council should\r\ndo more to increase the frequency of open meetings. One\r\neasy reform would be to consider the provisional work\r\nprogramme for each month at the beginning of a new\r\npresidency in a formal meeting. More serious consideration\r\nshould also be given to how to involve non-members in the\r\nCouncil’s deliberations on those issues in which they have\r\na direct interest. This requires that even more urgent\r\nattention be given to reconsidering the recent prevalence of\r\nthe practice of holding informal consultations of the whole,\r\nwhich are conducted only among Council members.\r\nThere is also a need to set up a more effective\r\nmechanism to alert non-members of the Council to the\r\npossibility of weekend or other emergency Council\r\nmeetings well in advance. Steady efforts have been made\r\nin this regard. Unfortunately, however, there still remains\r\nthe problem of late notice for the Council’s emergency\r\nmeetings, which has prevented a number of interested non-\r\nmembers from taking part in such meetings. We believe\r\nthat when unscheduled or emergency meetings of the\r\nCouncil are anticipated, the presidency of the Security\r\nCouncil should make its best efforts to give instructions to\r\nthe Secretariat so that it can send emergency notices to\r\nnon-members of the Council as soon as possible.\r\nLast but not least, we cannot overemphasize the need\r\nto continue our collective efforts to devise new transparency\r\nmeasures that are both feasible and easily implementable.\r\nIt is essential for the Council to keep abreast of the general\r\nmembership’s views proposed in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform. In this regard, the\r\ninformal working group on Council documentation and\r\nprocedure should play a more proactive role in filtering the\r\npropositions made in the Open-ended Working Group and\r\nrefining them in a practical way. We are of the view that\r\nthese two working groups can reinforce each other in\r\npursuing the common task of ensuring the greater\r\ntransparency of the Council.\r\nMy delegation remains deeply committed to the\r\ncause of greater transparency of the Council. At the end\r\nof our tenure in the Council last December we and other\r\nnon-permanent members took the joint initiative of\r\nsending to the President of the Council a letter containing\r\na number of practical suggestions for transparency\r\nmeasures. Then we followed up on that initiative in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group by submitting the two\r\nwritten proposals that are contained in the Working\r\nGroup’s report to the General Assembly.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to emphasize the need for\r\na more effective partnership between the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council in the discharge of\r\ntheir common task of coping with the broad range of new\r\nconflicts and instabilities in the post-cold-war period. This\r\ngoal can be attained only through a continuous reform of\r\nthe working methods of the Council. Indeed, transparency\r\nin the work of the Council is the easiest short cut to\r\nenhanced partnership between these two vital United\r\nNations organs. The Republic of Korea will continue to\r\nmake its positive contribution on the basis of the recent\r\nexperience gained from its two-year involvement in the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\nMr. Varso (Slovakia): At the outset, allow me to\r\nthank the President of the Security Council for the month\r\nof October, Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the\r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom, for his\r\ncomprehensive presentation of the Council’s annual report\r\nto the General Assembly. Our compliments also go to the\r\nSecretariat for the excellent preparation of the report and\r\nits submission in a timely manner.\r\nThe relationship between the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly, as the two principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, is a crucial factor in the Organization’s\r\noverall performance. Actions of the two organs must be\r\nconcerted and mutually reinforcing in order to achieve\r\ngreater coherence of effort to secure the primary goal of\r\nthe Organization, namely, the efficient maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nFor that purpose, the flow of information on the\r\nwork of the Security Council to the general membership\r\nshould be as informative and transparent as possible. At\r\npresent, there are just two channels through which the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\ngeneral membership can obtain such information: one is the\r\ndaily briefing by the presidency of the Security Council,\r\nand the other one is the annual report submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly under Article 24 of the Charter. Since\r\nthe daily briefing by the presidency based on the Council’s\r\ninformal consultations is merely an informal interaction\r\nbetween the presidency and non-members, the only official\r\nsource of information on the Council’s work remains its\r\nannual report.\r\nIn recent years, a number of points have been raised\r\nby Member States in order to transform the annual report\r\nof the Security Council into a more substantive and\r\nanalytical assessment of the Council’s work. After a\r\nthorough study of the Council’s last report, covering the\r\nperiod from 16 June 1997 to 15 June 1998, my delegation\r\nis pleased to note several improvements in regard to the\r\ncontent and format of the report. Unlike previous reports,\r\neach chapter of part I is introduced by background\r\ninformation on the decisions taken by the Council in\r\nrelation to particular subjects for the one-year period\r\npreceding the period covered. The new part V is devoted to\r\nthe work of the subsidiary organs of the Council, and\r\nprovides, for the first time, information on the work of the\r\nsanctions committees. Assessments of the work of the\r\nCouncil, prepared by each outgoing presidency under its\r\nown responsibility for the month during which it presided,\r\nare attached as an addendum to the report. This progress is\r\nhighly welcome; nevertheless, we believe there is still\r\nroom, as well as a need, for further improvements.\r\nSlovakia joins the voices calling for enhancing the\r\nanalytical nature of the Council’s annual report. We\r\nperceive the attachment of monthly assessments of the\r\nCouncil’s work to the report to be a first step. These\r\nassessments should be transformed into monthly reports\r\nfocusing on an analytical evaluation of the Council’s work\r\nwithin informal consultations and the process leading to\r\ndecisions of the Council during the period under review.\r\nThe monthly report should also reflect the divergence of\r\nviews among Council members on the matter in question\r\nand should avoid factual data already covered by other parts\r\nof the annual report. In order to avoid possible lengthy\r\ndiscussions necessary for the monthly report’s approval by\r\nthe Council members, it should be prepared as the sole\r\nresponsibility of the outgoing presidency.\r\nTransparency in the decision-making process and\r\nworking methods of the Security Council is a major issue\r\nof the ongoing debate on Council reform. Lack of\r\ntransparency undermines the Council’s credibility and\r\ncontributes to widening the gap between the Council and\r\nthe rest of the membership. The long-standing prevalence\r\nof the practice of informal meetings, the so-called\r\nconsultations of the whole, has been a matter of concern\r\nnot only of the Member States which have never served\r\nas Members of the Security Council, but also of those\r\nthat have very recent experience of being non-permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nDistinctive features of the informal consultations are\r\ndiscussion behind closed doors and the absence of any\r\nwritten records. The only way for non-members to get\r\nany information is either to attend an informal briefing by\r\nthe presidency conducted later that day or to spend the\r\nnecessary amounts of time in the next room, waiting for\r\na Council member willing to share some information at\r\nthe end of the consultations. Apparently, the current\r\npractice does not meet the requirements for the interaction\r\nbetween the Council and the general membership to be\r\nopen and transparent. Although the Security Council is\r\nmaster of its work, informal consultations should not\r\nserve as a systematic substitute for formal meetings, but\r\nrather a complementary one.\r\nWe believe that records not only of the formal\r\nmeetings of the Council, but also of its informal\r\nconsultations, should be included in its annual report. This\r\nwould enhance significantly the transparency of the\r\nCouncil’s work, ensure the accountability of each of its\r\nmembers to the rest of the membership and improve its\r\nrelationship with the General Assembly. Similarly, there\r\nis a need to bring the work of the sanctions committees\r\ncloser to the general membership. The sanctions\r\ncommittees rely in most cases solely on the cooperation\r\nof States and organizations in a position to provide them\r\nwith pertinent information on violations of the sanctions\r\nconcerned. Thus, efficient implementation of the measures\r\ntaken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, and the subsequent establishment of a\r\ncomprehensive regime to monitor the implementation of\r\nthe prohibitions, is a two-way process. Enhanced\r\ntransparency and closer cooperation between the Security\r\nCouncil and Member States are needed if the actions of\r\nthe Security Council, taken on behalf of Member States,\r\nare to be more resolute and efficient.\r\nThe dynamics of the post-cold-war era have brought\r\nnew challenges to the United Nations and its principal\r\norgans, including the Security Council. Many conflicts of\r\nthis period have taken the form of intra-State violence,\r\ncivil strife and ethnic clashes that have significant\r\nexternal repercussions and disastrous humanitarian\r\nimplications. However, the more recent decline in\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\npeacekeeping activity without a parallel decline in the level\r\nof conflict requiring international attention may prove to be\r\ncounter-productive. The Security Council cannot afford this\r\nkind of lethargy, which could lead to possible damage to its\r\ncredibility. A timely decision and response of the Security\r\nCouncil to a conflict or threat of conflict, including\r\npreventive measures, are crucial in order to avoid the\r\nmultiplication of tragic consequences.\r\nPeacekeeping operations have taken on a more\r\ncomplex nature, often fulfilling multifunctional tasks.\r\nTroop-contributing countries which carry the burden of a\r\npeacekeeping operation on the ground should be allowed to\r\nparticipate appropriately in the decision-making process\r\nbefore any decision on the mandate of the operation has\r\nbeen taken by the Security Council.\r\nWe appreciate the framework within which the current\r\npractice of holding meetings of troop-contributing countries\r\nhas been established. However, those meetings should not\r\nbecome routine, but rather ensure the more active\r\nparticipation of troop-contributors and a constructive\r\nexchange of views. In this connection, my delegation is\r\nproposing that the relevant section of the Council’s annual\r\nreport, currently a mere list of dates, be filled in with a\r\ndescription of the most important points raised at particular\r\nmeetings of troop-contributing countries.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress once again the\r\nimportance of the interactive and transparent relationship\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly.\r\nSlovakia is ready to contribute to further improvements in\r\nthe work of the Security Council. It is also in this context\r\nthat my country aspires to be elected a member of the\r\nSecurity Council for the period 2000-2001.\r\nMr. Sychou (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nAt the outset, I wish to thank the Ambassador of the United\r\nKingdom for the report he has submitted and the Secretariat\r\nfor preparing a comprehensive report on the work of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe work of the Security Council, which enjoys\r\ncomprehensive power in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, is at the focus of the international\r\ncommunity’s attention. The Security Council’s authority, as\r\nconfirmed in the practice of recent years, is broad enough\r\nto prevent and seek solutions to crisis situations through the\r\nmethods of preventive diplomacy, with minimum recourse\r\nto the use of force, which generally cannot be used without\r\nthe Council’s authorization.\r\nIn recent times, the international community has\r\nattached serious importance to the process of the\r\nstructural and institutional reform of the Security Council,\r\na main organ of the United Nations system devoted to\r\nlong-standing traditions that must adapt to contemporary\r\nrealities. We feel that its willingness to seek compromise\r\nin the broader interests of the Member States should\r\nguarantee the success of the Council’s reform process,\r\nwhich calls for a corresponding display of political will.\r\nWe believe that changes in the context of the\r\nSecurity Council should seek to ensure the equitable\r\ngeographical representation on the Council of all regional\r\ngroups, without exception; increased transparency and\r\nopenness of the Council; and a rationalization of its\r\nworking methods in the areas of information and\r\nconsultation.\r\nThe main components of reform include the\r\nimprovement of the Security Council’s accountability\r\nmechanism, one element of which is the Council’s\r\nsubmission to the General Assembly of annual reports on\r\nits work.\r\nThe substance of the Security Council’s report, in\r\nour view, lies not in the simple provision and subsequent\r\nrecording of statistical information, but in the desire to\r\nestablish an extensive dialogue on the problems between\r\nthe two most authoritative organs that would include an\r\nanalysis of the various points of view and their synthesis\r\nin specific, rational proposals for resolving issues on the\r\nCouncil’s and the Assembly’s agendas. It is precisely\r\nalong these lines, in our view, that the Security Council\r\nshould improve and develop its practice of submitting\r\nreports.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus notes with satisfaction some\r\ndefinite progress in the preparation and submission of the\r\nSecurity Council’s report this year. As before, we would\r\nstress primarily the need to make the substantive sector of\r\nthe report more analytical, based on an examination of\r\nboth the process of preparing the Council’s decisions and\r\nof the specific results of its work. In this context, the new\r\npractice of supplementing the Council’s reports with\r\nmonthly analytical assessments of its work, prepared by\r\nrepresentatives of former Presidents of the Council, is a\r\npositive one.\r\nAt the same time, as can be seen in the draft report,\r\nthis material should not be limited to general reiterations\r\nof the text of the report itself for any given period, but\r\nshould seek to analyze and assess the internal specifics of\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nthe Council’s work from the perspective of its President. It\r\nshould also contain commentaries and proposals with\r\nrespect to the Council’s adoption of decisions. Constructive\r\napproaches along these lines were demonstrated by the\r\ndelegations of Costa Rica, Chile and Portugal. We rightfully\r\nexpect the further confirmation of this practice in the\r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nAn additional impetus for enhancing the report’s\r\nanalytical nature could be the preparation of analytical\r\nreviews of the most important decisions taken by the\r\nCouncil for the period under consideration, including an\r\naccount and description of the motives for the decisions and\r\nthe difficulties involved in their adoption.\r\nThe goal of achieving greater transparency in the\r\nSecurity Council’s work can be met by including in the\r\nreport brief summaries of the results of the Council’s\r\ninformal consultations of the whole. I wish to express the\r\nhope, in this regard, that such information will be made\r\navailable in written form as the consultations are held, not\r\nmerely at the end of the reporting period in the text of the\r\nCouncil’s report.\r\nOne of the most feasible and effective ways to\r\nimprove the report further could be a deeper preliminary\r\nconsideration of the draft report at open meetings.\r\nMoreover, it seems important — as we have stressed more\r\nthan once — to introduce into practice procedures for the\r\nsubmission of Security Council reports by the President in\r\noffice at the time of their consideration or by one of the\r\npermanent members, on a rotational basis, as well as a\r\nstatement in response by the President of the Council or by\r\none of the five permanent members following the\r\ncompletion of the discussion of any given item on the\r\nagenda as a preliminary reaction to the proposals and\r\nrecommendations made by member States.\r\nWe also feel that it would be useful to include in the\r\nCouncil’s work the practice of holding guideline\r\ndiscussions, at the level of Foreign Minister, on the most\r\nimportant issues on the international agenda, similar to the\r\nmeeting held by the Security Council on 24 September this\r\nyear on progress in the maintenance of peace and security\r\nin Africa.\r\nBearing in mind the convergence of approaches on the\r\npart of most States in considering the working methods and\r\ntransparency of the Council, with respect to which an entire\r\nseries of innovations has been tried and proven, the\r\nRepublic of Belarus supports the continuation, during the\r\ncourse of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly,\r\nof the work of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in\r\nthe Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council. We hope that the\r\nWorking Group’s activities will open up broader\r\npossibilities for new proposals to improve current\r\npractices in the Security Council’s work.\r\nMr. Pérez-Otermin (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me at the outset, Sir, to thank\r\nAmbassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock for presenting the\r\nannual report of the Security Council in his capacity as\r\nPresident of that body. It is worth noting that in doing so\r\nhe was acting within the letter and spirit of the Charter of\r\nthe Organization and in accordance with Articles 15 and\r\n24.\r\nWhile it is true that the Security Council is, indeed,\r\nthe most important body in the Organization because of\r\nthe priority role entrusted to it, it is no less true that its\r\nactivities are carried out on behalf of and as representing\r\nits Member States, as is clearly expressed in Article 24 of\r\nthe Charter. My country therefore considers the subject of\r\nthis General Assembly meeting to be very important, both\r\nformally and substantively, as the Council is thereby\r\nfulfilling its duty by informing the sovereign body of the\r\nOrganization about the activities that it has carried out in\r\naccordance with its mandate.\r\nWe are pleased that the form and content of the\r\nreport reflects considerable progress towards the\r\nobjectives that the General Assembly has set out in its\r\nresolutions, the most recent being 51/193 of 17 December\r\n1996. However, that will not prevent us from taking this\r\nopportunity to refer to certain objectives that my\r\ndelegation believes should be pursued as soon as possible\r\nso that the Security Council does not lose the credibility\r\nthat, in the opinion of the States represented here and of\r\nthe public in general, it must have if it is to function\r\nproperly.\r\nThe purposes and principles of the Charter have\r\nbeen and continue to be the standard according to which\r\nany activity carried out must be cleared and reaffirmed,\r\nas must any basis for reform, in both form and substance.\r\nI do not believe I am mistaken in asserting that it is\r\ngenerally acknowledged that the main area of competence\r\nof the Security Council — the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security — has changed over time\r\nand that the conflicts with which the Council must deal\r\ndiffer in both form and character from those formerly\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nwithin its competence. Furthermore, progress in\r\ncommunications technology means that other ways and\r\nmeans must be envisaged for its activities on the basis of\r\ntheir new character.\r\nIn this context, we reaffirm once more that there can\r\nbe no peace without development and that there can be no\r\ndevelopment without education. We therefore believe that\r\nthe activities of the United Nations should be focused on\r\nachieving those values so as to accomplish its goals\r\nsuccessfully and on a permanent basis.\r\nAs is well known, my country, Uruguay, has had a\r\nsignificant presence in peacekeeping operations since their\r\ninception, taking part in 16 missions with a total of about\r\n10,000 men, with some loss of human life. However, that\r\ndoes not keep us from recognizing that conflict prevention\r\nhas become as important as dealing with conflict itself and\r\nthat, in turn, if post-conflict activities are not dealt with in\r\na responsible manner, the result might be the rekindling of\r\nconflicts that had been extinguished. My country therefore\r\nconsiders the work of the Organization in that area to be\r\nvital.\r\nIn that context, we agree with what has been\r\nreaffirmed here by many colleagues with regard to seeking\r\ngreater coordination between the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, giving greater viability to the\r\nArticles of the Charter that provide for such coordination so\r\nthat the Economic and Social Council can play its essential\r\nrole in the work of building or rebuilding peace wherever\r\ncooperation is required in various spheres such as\r\nagriculture, education, health and civil and civic life in all\r\nof its dimensions.\r\nI should not like to proceed with these brief comments\r\nwithout acknowledging that while there has been some\r\nnoteworthy progress in the activity of the Security Council,\r\nmuch remains to be done to ensure that it becomes more\r\ntransparent and democratic and that a greater part is played\r\nby States that are not members of the Council, as well as\r\ngenerally by those directly affected by measures taken by\r\nthat body. In such cases the channels of communication\r\nbetween those countries and the Council leave much room\r\nfor improvement.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation hopes that open meetings\r\nwill take place more frequently at which the opinions of\r\nnon-members can be heard; that Article 31 of the Charter\r\nand rule 37 of the provisional rules of procedure of the\r\nSecurity Council will be fully applied so as to increase the\r\nnecessary participation of non-members in Council\r\nmeetings; that more periodic meetings will be held with\r\ncountries that are affected by the decisions of the Council;\r\nand that non-members will be invited to participate in the\r\ninformal consultations of the Council when it discusses\r\nissues that affect them directly, in accordance with\r\nArticles 31 and 32 of the Charter.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (interpretation from French):\r\nMy delegation would first like to thank the Security\r\nCouncil for having submitted on a timely basis to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the report under consideration relating\r\nto its activities over the past year, from 16 June 1997 to\r\n15 June 1998, which has been submitted in conformity\r\nwith Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter. I should also like\r\nto thank the President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Greenstock of the United Kingdom, for\r\nhaving introduced the report.\r\nThe Assembly’s annual discussion of the report of\r\nthe Security Council provides an opportunity for 170\r\nStates Members of the Organization that are not members\r\nof the Council to be informed of the activities of this\r\nimportant body, whose main function is the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. It also provides a\r\nvaluable opportunity for the members of the Assembly to\r\nmake observations and suggestions about how to improve\r\nthe flow of information between the two principle bodies\r\nof our Organization, the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe note with interest the improvements made by the\r\nSecurity Council in its report to the Assembly for the past\r\nyear, particularly the inclusion of information relating to\r\nthe work of subsidiary bodies of the Council, including\r\nthe sanctions committees, and the introduction of\r\ninformation relating to the documentation, working\r\nmethods and procedure of the Council as well as to\r\nmeetings with troop-contributing countries.\r\nWe wish also to express our appreciation for the a\r\npractice reflected in this year’s report: the inclusion of\r\nbrief assessments of the work of the Council by\r\nsuccessive Presidents. Even if these are not intended to\r\nreflect the views of the Council, they have the merit of\r\nadding to the available information on the substance of\r\nthe work of the Council, especially with regard to\r\ninformal meetings. This and other elements certainly have\r\ntheir advantages, and we welcome them.\r\nYet my delegation considers that, despite these\r\ninnovations, the report of the Council in its new form\r\nremains a document whose basic concept is basically\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nunchanged; it continues to be a compilation of Council\r\ndecisions — resolutions and presidential statements — and\r\nof communications and documents received and generated\r\nby that organ, along with a factual description of the work\r\nof the Council. What is needed is an analysis of the items\r\nsubmitted to the Council and of the Council’s consideration\r\nof them.\r\nThat is why it is important for the Security Council to\r\nsubmit to the General Assembly special reports on specific\r\nquestions, as needed — for which provision is made in the\r\nCharter. That would certainly help improve the information\r\navailable to all States Members of the Organization on the\r\nsubstance of the Council’s activities, particularly at a time\r\nwhen those activities have proliferated and grown more\r\ndiverse. Above all, it would facilitate objective assessment\r\nof the work of the Council.\r\nWe welcome the readiness expressed by the Security\r\nCouncil to continue its consideration of other ways to\r\nimprove its documentation and procedures, including the\r\nsubmission of special reports as provided for in Article 24\r\n(3) of the Charter. We appeal to the Council to formulate\r\nnew measures to increase the transparency of its work.\r\nHere, we favour more formal meetings open to all Member\r\nStates, enabling them to address the Council on a variety of\r\nimportant questions. We suggest also improved modalities\r\nfor the reports made by the President of the Council to non-\r\nmembers following informal consultations; these should be\r\nmore detailed.\r\nIn conclusion, I express my hope that the Council will\r\ncontinue to give due attention to improving the form and\r\ncontent of its report to the Assembly, and to increasing\r\ntransparency in its work. We hope too that the discussions\r\nin the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council will lead to a specific plan\r\nfor reforming the Council’s working methods in a manner\r\nthat will meet the shared expectations of all countries.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call on\r\nthe representative of Burkina Faso, who wishes to make a\r\nstatement in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): I wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply on\r\nbehalf of the States members of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU). In his statement on agenda item 11, “Report\r\nof the Security Council“, delivered at the 41st meeting, the\r\nrepresentative of Canada commented on the decision by the\r\nheads of State of the OAU to lift sanctions against the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya. In his view, this constituted “a\r\ntroubling precedent which ... is contrary to the ...\r\nCharter”.\r\nI believe that I speak for the OAU in saying that we\r\nfeel rather indignant about this, and that we do not\r\nunderstand Canada’s position. When the representative of\r\nCanada spoke of respect for the Charter he was knocking\r\nat an open door. We remind him that the OAU has a\r\ncharter of its own, founded on the same principles of\r\ninternational law and the same moral values. Above all,\r\nAfrica has wisdom of its own, which gives priority to\r\ndialogue over coercion in the settlement of all disputes\r\nand misunderstandings. It is inconceivable to us that in\r\nany major forum, much less the United Nations, anyone\r\nshould venture so blithely to censure a unanimous\r\ndecision by 53 heads of State, forgetting that their\r\ncountries constitute nearly a third of the membership of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nOur leaders took the decision to lift the embargo\r\nagainst Libya after lengthy consideration, after an in-depth\r\nanalysis of the situation and after weighing all the pros\r\nand cons. African States, to be sure, are Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, but Africa has its own problems, to\r\nwhich we are seeking African solutions. Our position\r\ncannot be interpreted as a challenge to the Security\r\nCouncil. Our consolation is that this assessment did not\r\ncome from the two members of the Security Council that\r\nare directly involved in the crisis; their restraint since the\r\nOuagadougou decision leads us to believe at the least that\r\nthey understand the decision so cautiously taken by our\r\nheads of State.\r\nAfrica will certainly take note of Canada’s attempt\r\nto repay it in this way for its votes, which counted for a\r\ngreat deal in Canada’s election to a Security Council seat.\r\nAfrican representatives here in any event are well aware\r\nof this state of affairs, and through the current Chairman\r\nof the Organization of African Unity, we will of course\r\nbring it to the attention of our heads of State.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): May\r\nI take it that the Assembly decides to take note of the\r\nreport of the Security Council contained in document\r\nA/53/2?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 42nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 22 October 1998\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We have\r\nthus concluded this stage of our consideration of agenda\r\nitem 11.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.30 p.m.\r\n20\r\n"
