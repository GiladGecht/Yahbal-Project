(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 16 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other\r\nelections\r\n(a) Election of seven members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/53/440)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In\r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 42/450 of 17\r\nDecember 1987, the Assembly elects the members of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination upon their\r\nnomination by the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/53/440,\r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to fill the vacancies in the Committee that will\r\noccur as a result of the expiration on 31 December 1998 of\r\nthe terms of office of China, the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, Egypt, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Togo and\r\nUruguay.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1 January\r\n1999, the following States will still be members of the\r\nCommittee: Argentina, Austria, the Bahamas, Brazil,\r\nCameroon, the Congo, France, Germany, Indonesia, the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Mexico, Nicaragua,\r\nNigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, the Russian\r\nFederation, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda,\r\nUkraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, the United States of America, Zambia\r\nand Zimbabwe.\r\nAccordingly, those 26 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nI should now like to inform members that the\r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic\r\nand Social Council. There are two African States for three\r\nvacancies: Benin and Egypt. There is one Latin American\r\nand Caribbean State for one vacancy: Uruguay. There are\r\nthree Asian States for three vacancies: China, Japan and\r\nthe Republic of Korea.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,\r\nall elections should be held by secret ballot. However, in\r\naccordance with paragraph 16 of decision 34/401, the\r\nAssembly may, in elections to subsidiary organs, dispense\r\nwith secret balloting when the number of candidates\r\ncorresponds to the number of seats to be filled.\r\nThe number of States nominated from among the\r\nAfrican States, the Asian States and the Latin American\r\nand Caribbean States is equal to or does not exceed the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled in each of those regions.\r\nMay I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes to\r\ndeclare those States nominated by the Economic and\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nSocial Council from among the African States, the Asian\r\nStates and the Latin American and Caribbean States —\r\nnamely, Benin, China, Egypt, Japan, the Republic of Korea\r\nand Uruguay — elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination for a three-year term\r\nbeginning on 1 January 1999?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\ncongratulate the States that have been elected members of\r\nthe Committee for Programme and Coordination.\r\nRegarding the one vacancy remaining from among the\r\nAfrican States and the one vacancy remaining from among\r\nthe Western Europe and other States held over from a\r\nprevious session, the General Assembly will be in a\r\nposition to act on them upon the nomination by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council of one Member State from\r\neach of those two regions.\r\nI therefore propose that the Assembly keep this sub-\r\nitem on the agenda of the fifty-third session.\r\nIf I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Assembly\r\nagrees to that procedure.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We have\r\nthus concluded this stage of our consideration of sub-item\r\n(a) of agenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 17\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother appointments\r\n(h) Appointment of a member of the Joint Inspection\r\nUnit\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/53/109)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): As\r\nindicated in document A/53/109, the General Assembly is\r\nrequired during the fifty-third session to appoint a member\r\nto fill the vacancy on the Joint Inspection Unit that will\r\narise from the expiration of the term of office on 31\r\nDecember 1999 of Mr. Sumihiro Kuyama of Japan.\r\nAs also indicated in document A/53/109, in\r\naccordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the statute of\r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit, the President of the General\r\nAssembly shall consult with Member States to draw up a\r\nlist of countries — in this case, one country — that\r\nwould be requested to propose a candidate for\r\nappointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nAfter holding the necessary consultations, I should\r\nlike to communicate to the Assembly the information,\r\nreceived from the Chairman of the Group of Asian States,\r\nthat the Group of Asian States has agreed that Japan\r\nshould propose one candidate for the vacancy.\r\nIn accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the\r\nstatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, Japan will therefore\r\nbe requested to propose a candidate and a curriculum\r\nvitae highlighting the candidate\u0027s relevant qualifications\r\nfor the task ahead.\r\nAfter holding the appropriate consultations described\r\nin article 3, paragraph 2, of the statute of the Joint\r\nInspection Unit, including consultations with the President\r\nof the Economic and Social Council and with the\r\nSecretary-General in his capacity as Chairman of the\r\nAdministrative Committee on Coordination, I will submit\r\nto the Assembly a qualified candidate for appointment to\r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 17.\r\nAgenda item 51\r\nElimination of coercive economic measures as a means\r\nof political and economic compulsion\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.7/Rev.1)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to the representative of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya to introduce draft resolution A/53/L.7/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Dorda (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): In the aftermath of the collapse, almost a\r\ndecade ago, of the international balance — or, in the\r\nterms used by some, when the cold war ended — people\r\nof goodwill believed that the era of tensions, conflicts,\r\nwars and the arms race was for ever gone. They believed\r\nthat the international community could breathe a little\r\neasier; that the world would witness a new phase in its\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nhistory, a phase of constructive cooperation; that savings\r\nand revenues would be devoted to development and to the\r\nachievement of progress within a framework of\r\ncomplementary action. This was their optimistic explanation\r\nof the other term they coined, “the new world order”.\r\nHowever, no sooner had the people of goodwill awakened\r\nfrom their daydreams than they realized that what had\r\nreally happened and what was taking place on the ground\r\nwas different from their expectations and hopes.\r\nTheir dreams rapidly evaporated. They realized that\r\nthey had no time even for daydreaming. Instead of one cold\r\nwar, they witnessed the eruption of, or caused to erupt,\r\nseveral “hot” wars that consumed the blood of innocent\r\nhuman beings. Some of these wars were stopped and some\r\ntemporarily abated. Some of them are still raging and some\r\nsimmering. However, all of them have taken human lives\r\nin numbers too high to count and have left behind\r\nincalculable damage and destruction. All the losses have yet\r\nto be tallied. The only increases have been in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations, the number of refugee\r\ncamps and the number of hungry and orphaned. The sigh\r\nof relief has given way in this era to confusion, fear and\r\nanxiety caused by pressures, threats and orders imposed\r\nfrom above.\r\nInstead of constructive cooperation, an era of\r\nembargoes, boycotts and economic blockades was ushered\r\nin. In terms of both human and material casualties, the\r\nvictims of this era may surpass in numbers the victims of\r\ndestructive wars. After all these years have elapsed, and\r\nsince the collapse of international balance — or as the\r\nothers may say, “the end of the cold war” — all dreams,\r\nhopes, and wishes have indeed evaporated. There was a\r\nstark new awakening to the light of a bitter truth.\r\nThe international community realized that the victor of\r\na non-war — the so-called cold war — had decided to put\r\nits political, economic, cultural and social stamp on the\r\nworld. The world would merely have to listen and obey.\r\nThis applies even to the victor\u0027s closest allies. That victor\r\nalso decided that its interests came above and before\r\neveryone else\u0027s interests, even those who shared common\r\ninterests with that victor.\r\nThe victor in the cold war believed that the\r\ninternational situation had become ripe for it to dictate its\r\nconditions and issue its orders so that it could re-draw the\r\nworld map in a manner that would guarantee its own\r\ninterests before the rise of any kind of international\r\nequilibrium or balance, and could pre-empt the rise of such\r\na balance.\r\nNow, those countries that disobey the\r\naforementioned orders and try to build their own societies\r\nbased on their own particularities, and as an extension of\r\ntheir own roots, or based on their intellectual convictions\r\nor political and economic options, are qualified as “rogue\r\nStates”. Orders were issued to freeze the assets and funds\r\nof such countries that were invested in the country\r\nconcerned. Even their imports, which were fully paid for\r\nand which met all applicable international legal\r\nconditions, were frozen. Then laws were enacted which\r\nwould punish the rest of the countries of the world if they\r\ndealt with these countries or if their dealings with them\r\nexceeded a certain limit.\r\nIt is indeed a new world order. But why all of this?\r\nLet us reply to this question by raising some\r\nquestions of our own: First, why was Libya not punished\r\nbefore 1 September 1969, the date of its revolution?\r\nSecond, was this due to the fact that before that date,\r\nLibya had accepted the establishment of military bases on\r\nits soil? Was it because after that date Libya cleared out\r\nthose bases, liberating its land and skies? Third, was it\r\nbecause before that date Libya had signed concessions\r\nwith American oil companies that focused on the interests\r\nof those companies at the expense of the interests of the\r\nLibyan people? And because after that date, Libya\r\ncorrected all mistakes retroactively, thus restoring to the\r\nLibyan people their usurped rights?\r\nFourth, was it because Libya, prior to that date, had\r\naccepted being an occupied dependency when the treaty\r\nconcluded with the United States deprived Libya of the\r\nsimplest elements of sovereignty over its own territory?\r\nAt that time, Libyan police could not apprehend the pilots\r\nwho used Libyan shepherds and their sheep as training\r\ntargets and killed them. Libya\u0027s prosecutorial authorities\r\nwere unable to investigate, and its courts were unable to\r\ntry, the culprits for their premeditated crimes. Even\r\nchildren were not spared these training runs. As a result,\r\na young girl named Emmetika was killed, together with\r\na number of other children. The air base, formerly known\r\nas Wheelus Air Base, now carries the name Emmetika as\r\na sign of respect commemorating her and all those\r\nmartyrs who were killed by aerial bombardment or under\r\nthe wheels of vehicles driven by clearly inebriated\r\nsoldiers and officers from American military bases. These\r\nincidents are documented with dates and places. We can\r\nprovide this information via the Internet so that it will be\r\nknown for sure that we are not falsely accusing anyone.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nWas this also due to the fact that, after that date,\r\nLibya achieved true independence and freed its decision-\r\nmaking from any dependence on anyone? Fifth, where are\r\nthe human rights of those martyrs? Are they not human\r\nbeings like any other human beings? Or, perhaps, human\r\nrights, too, have taken their leave?\r\nSixth, why was Iran not punished before its Islamic\r\nRevolution? Why is it being punished now? Seventh, why\r\nwas the Shah of Iran supported at a time when he was\r\nfilling all prisons with all free men and all those who\r\ndiffered with him in opinion, and while his intelligence\r\nservice — the SAVAK — was the most infamous organ of\r\nsuppression in the second half of this century? Perhaps that\r\nwas not terrorism, because it was in the service of the\r\ninterests of those who made the Shah the policeman in the\r\narea against those who did care for the interests of their\r\nhomeland, Iran. Human rights at the time must have been\r\nin some sort of coma.\r\nEighth, why are Iran\u0027s assets frozen? Why is an\r\nembargo imposed against it and against those who\r\ncooperate with it for good and prosperity? Is it because Iran\r\ndecided to be independent and refrained from performing\r\nthe role of the policeman previously performed by the\r\nShah? Is it because Iran decided to be the master of its own\r\ndestiny? Or is it perhaps because it returned to its roots and\r\nits religion and decided to shed all that is alien to it?\r\nNinth, why is the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea being punished? Who fought against whom? Which\r\ndivided itself from the other? Which is standing against\r\nreunification with the other? Why do we not leave every\r\nsociety to itself, to decide its own destiny, without any\r\ninterference?\r\nViet Nam and Germany are good living examples.\r\nUntil recently, the call for the unification of Germany could\r\nhave been called an aberration. My country did not fear\r\nbeing accused of such an aberration. Our leader, from the\r\nrostrum of the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Belgrade,\r\ncalled for the reunification of Germany. Those who did not\r\nhave political vision, those who did not read human history\r\nand thus were unable to absorb its lessons, were surprised\r\nat such a call. Yet Germany today is one united country.\r\nSocial facts impose themselves on events of both history\r\nand geography. But who is able to learn such lessons?\r\nTenth, why is the Sudan being punished now? Is it\r\nbecause it is no longer Numayri\u0027s Sudan? Or because it is\r\nlaying the basis for a path linking it to its own roots,\r\nhistory and environment? Maybe that is why the Sudan is\r\nbeing strangled. Or is it because the democracy of\r\nreligious sects was better than the existing political\r\nregime in the Sudan? Does anybody have the right to\r\nimpose a political formula on others? From where did\r\nthey acquire such a right? Who gave them such a\r\nmandate? And why did the United States exclude Arabic\r\ngum products from the embargo? Perhaps Arabic gum is\r\nnot Sudanese.\r\nEleventh, why is Cuba being punished? The\r\nstatement made several days ago in this Hall by the\r\nForeign Minister of Cuba gave all the answers to that\r\nquestion.\r\nThe acceptance of the right of a certain country to\r\nenact and implement extraterritorial laws could set a\r\nprecedent for all other countries, enabling them to enact\r\nsimilar extraterritorial laws and to try to give them effect.\r\nIn this case, would the world in which we live be\r\ncivilized, or would it become a jungle?\r\nAmong the options that cannot be precluded is the\r\nfact that the producers of any given commodity, and\r\nespecially raw materials, could be forced to establish\r\nspecial organizations among themselves to preserve their\r\ninterests in the international market, be they agricultural,\r\nmineral or other. Such action would be justifiable by a\r\nnumber of objective considerations, not to mention the\r\ninterests of those concerned. Various regions might be\r\nforced to set up their own economic groupings and\r\npressures would be ineffective because the situation has\r\nbecome one of life or death. Continents could soon\r\nbecome self-contained economic frameworks, regardless\r\nof all internal and external conditions. This is no longer\r\nan option — it is now a very urgent and vital necessity.\r\nThe international community is called upon to do\r\naway with a precedent that could take the world to the\r\nbrink of the unknown, with all its possible consequences\r\nand repercussions. I can understand that one member or\r\neven several members may have their own view of Libya;\r\nthat is their right. Certainly, Libya has its own opinion of\r\na certain country and even of several countries. Libya is,\r\nin turn, entitled to that opinion. However, the draft\r\nresolution before the Assembly today does not concern\r\nLibya alone and its wording is very clear to all. This is a\r\ncommon issue which concerns the entire international\r\ncommunity. The voting will be on the subject matter, and\r\nnot on Libya. Thus, it would be meaningless to agree to\r\nthe content of the draft resolution and then to abstain\r\nfrom voting in favour of it. Any explanation of an\r\nabstention would also be absolutely meaningless.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nThe subject of the draft resolution relates to what is\r\nenacted by States, and not to what is enacted by the United\r\nNations. Thus, this cannot justify or explain any abstention\r\neither. Those who support the content of the draft resolution\r\nmust not fail to hit the green button when voting begins.\r\nMr. Donokusumo (Indonesia): On behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, I would like to make a few brief\r\nand general comments on this important draft resolution.\r\nIn this era of globalization and liberalization, the\r\npractice of imposing unilateral coercive measures of an\r\nextraterritorial nature has accrued additional serious\r\ndimensions and its impact can have devastating\r\nconsequences for the affected countries. Such practices run\r\ncounter to the imperatives of international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment and to the spirit of partnership being fostered\r\nin the increasingly interdependent world. Moreover, the\r\nimposition of such measures by one country on another\r\ncontravenes international law and is totally incompatible,\r\nnot only with international rules and regulations, but also\r\nwith the principles of equal sovereignty, non-intervention\r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign\r\nStates.\r\nAs a result, such coercive actions prevent the affected\r\ncountries from enjoying their equal and non-discriminatory\r\nrights in pursuing development and from freely expanding\r\ntheir international trade. In fact, resolution 1994/47 of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights states that such measures,\r\nunilaterally implemented against developing countries,\r\nhinder the full realization of all rights set forth in the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly the\r\nright of people to a minimum standard of living and\r\ndevelopment. In addition, in his subsequent report\r\n(E/CN.4/1995/43), responding to this resolution, the\r\nSecretary-General stated that the application of such\r\nmeasures is incompatible with the principle of international\r\ncooperation, has a negative impact on the economies of the\r\ndeveloping countries suffering these measures, and\r\nconstitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the\r\naffected individuals, groups and peoples.\r\nFor these purposes, the international community\r\nshould work together, striving to ensure that countries\r\nrefrain from such activities. In this regard, it is necessary to\r\nensure that the World Trade Organization be kept free of\r\npolitical constraints and be economy-oriented. The\r\ninternational community should also seek to promote the\r\nright to development of all countries, in conformity with the\r\nprinciples and spirit of the United Nations and its Charter.\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana): A few days ago, in this very\r\nHall, the General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming\r\nmajority a resolution on the necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by\r\nthe United States of America against Cuba. Today, the\r\nAssembly is being called upon to consider the need to\r\neliminate coercive economic measures as a means of\r\npolitical and economic compulsion.\r\nAlthough, prima facie, the scope of the present\r\nagenda item is more general than that of the resolution\r\nadopted a few days ago, the underlying principles at stake\r\nare the same in the two cases. Consequently, the reasons\r\nwhich informed the massive condemnation of the\r\neconomic embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba hold true for the elimination of\r\ncoercive measures generally as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion.\r\nThe main objective of all such measures is to\r\nprevent the targeted State or States from exercising their\r\nright to decide, voluntarily, their own political, economic\r\nand social systems. But that runs counter to the cardinal\r\nprinciple of the United Nations Charter, which upholds\r\nthe sovereign equality of States and non-intervention and\r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs.\r\nAgain, the legislation backing such measures,\r\nepitomized by the so-called Helms-Burton and D\u0027Amato-\r\nKennedy Acts passed by the United States Congress, have\r\nextraterritorial effects which adversely affect the\r\nsovereignty of third States, the legitimate interests of\r\nentities or persons under their jurisdiction and the\r\nfreedom of trade and navigation. From that perspective,\r\nthe legislation violates not only the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations and the norms of\r\ninternational law, but also freedom of international trade\r\nand navigation, which is enshrined in many international\r\nlegal instruments, including those of the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nAnother feature of the measures in question, and the\r\nlegislation backing them, is that they are unilateral in\r\nnature, taken without any regard whatsoever to the United\r\nNations Charter principle requiring all Member States to\r\nrefrain from the threat or use of force in their\r\ninternational relations or to the provisions of Chapter VI\r\nof the Charter, which call on Member States to settle\r\ndisputes by peaceful means such as negotiation, inquiry,\r\nmediation, conciliation, arbitration and judicial settlement.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nWe are also disturbed by the recent attempt to\r\nintroduce new concepts of international law aimed at\r\ninternationalizing the essential elements contained in\r\nextraterritorial laws through multilateral agreements. We\r\nreject outright all such attempts, as we do the present trend\r\nto strengthen and expand these elements through the\r\nBretton Woods institutions. We also reaffirm our rejection\r\nof evaluations, certifications and other coercive measures\r\nused as a tool for pressurizing Member States.\r\nThere have been numerous resolutions in the past in\r\nwhich this Assembly has called upon Member States to\r\ntake urgent and effective steps to end coercive economic\r\nmeasures in their international relations. Notable among\r\nthem is General Assembly resolution 51/22 of 1996. At\r\ntheir recent summit meeting, held in Durban in September\r\nthis year, the heads of State or Government of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement reaffirmed their rejection of all such\r\nmeasures and of the enactment of extraterritorial laws as\r\nbeing incompatible with international law and the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. Earlier in the\r\nyear, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity also adopted a decision\r\nexpressing concern at the continued imposition of\r\nextraterritorial coercive measures and calling for their\r\nelimination. Furthermore, on several occasions, the heads of\r\nState or Government at the Ibero-American Summits have\r\ncalled for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade\r\nmeasures by one State against another that affect the free\r\nflow of international trade. And just a few days ago, the\r\nentire European Union, speaking in this Assembly through\r\nits spokesman, the representative of Austria, expressed its\r\nvehement opposition to unilateral coercive legislation which\r\nhas extraterritorial effects.\r\nFor all these reasons, my delegation calls once more\r\nupon States which apply unilateral coercive measures to put\r\nan immediate end to them. We also call on all States not to\r\nrecognize any legislative enactments which back such\r\nmeasures.\r\nWe wish to conclude by reiterating that it is the\r\ninalienable right of every State, however small, however\r\nweak and however poor, to choose the political, economic\r\nand social system that it deems appropriate for the well-\r\nbeing of its people, in accordance with its own national\r\nplans, policies and priorities. No other State has the\r\nprerogative or the right to interfere in the exercise of such\r\nchoice.\r\nMy delegation will vote in favour of draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.7/Rev.1.\r\nMs. Flórez Prida (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The position of the Government of the Republic\r\nof Cuba on the item that has brought us together today is\r\nvery well known. The Government of the Republic of\r\nCuba made public its rejection of the 1996 Iran and Libya\r\nSanctions Act, also known as the D\u0027Amato-Kennedy Act,\r\nfrom the very moment that it was passed. Consequently,\r\nwe voted in favour of General Assembly resolution 51/22,\r\nwhich called for the immediate repeal of unilateral\r\nextraterritorial laws that impose sanctions on companies\r\nand nationals of third States and which also called for\r\nsuch measures not to be recognized.\r\nBy means of that law the United States of America\r\nis seeking once again to extend the scope of its domestic\r\nlegislation to third States — an action that has repeatedly\r\nbeen denounced — in this case, by applying sanctions on\r\ncompanies and individuals from countries that trade with\r\nor invest in the oil sectors of Libya and Iran.\r\nThe enactment of such measures reveals the true\r\nnature of the policy being pursued by those countries that\r\nclaim to promote trade liberalization but that at the same\r\ntime seek to impose their domestic legislation on all other\r\ncountries, including their closest allies, without any moral,\r\nlegal or political basis.\r\nAlthough it has been recognized by a number of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, it is necessary to reiterate\r\nthat the application of such measures by one country\r\nagainst another is a blatant violation of international law\r\nand of the principles of the Charter, including the\r\nsovereign equality of States and non-intervention and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of sovereign States.\r\nThe international community has repeatedly\r\ncondemned the damaging effects of the application of\r\nsuch measures on the health, well-being and enjoyment of\r\nhuman rights of people, in particular those in the most\r\nvulnerable sectors of the countries to which they are\r\napplied.\r\nMy country profoundly believes that in the current\r\ninternational circumstances the international community\r\nmust prevent the proliferation of such measures,\r\nparticularly those that are extraterritorial, and demand an\r\nend to such practices.\r\nAccepting such legislation would mean recognizing\r\na system of international relations that favours the\r\nhegemony and irresponsible policy of one great Power.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nMy delegation, consistent with its condemnation of\r\nany extraterritorial act that violates the sovereignty of\r\npeoples, associates itself with the broad international\r\nrejection of this kind of legislation and trusts that the\r\nUnited Nations will play its proper role in ensuring that the\r\nwill and the decisions of the international community in this\r\nregard are upheld.\r\nConsequently, the Cuban delegation will vote in favour\r\nof draft resolution A/53/L.7/Rev.1, entitled “Elimination of\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion”.\r\nMr. Al-Hitti (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): May\r\nwe at the outset express our thanks and appreciation to the\r\nfraternal delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for its\r\nefforts to have this item included in the agenda of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe international community has been overwhelmingly\r\npreoccupied in recent years due to the increased arbitrary\r\nuse of economic and political coercive measures — whether\r\nimposed unilaterally or collectively, under the banner of the\r\nUnited Nations — through the abuse of authority by some\r\nof the powerful States in the Security Council.\r\nThe numerous reports adopted by the specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations and intergovernmental or\r\nnon-governmental organizations have all confirmed beyond\r\nany doubt that these coercive measures affect directly and\r\ndangerously all aspects of society, economy, health and\r\neducation in all countries targeted by these sanctions. Their\r\nnegative impact on those affected will continue for many\r\ngenerations to come as a result of the concomitant physical\r\nand psychological trauma left after the sanctions are lifted.\r\nAs is well known, this economic and political coercion\r\naffects third countries linked through economic relations\r\nwith this or that targeted country. This endangers the\r\ninternational trade system and international relations as a\r\nwhole.\r\nThe Charter clearly states the circumstances in which\r\nthe international community may have to resort to the use\r\nof economic sanctions. The first of these is the existence of\r\nany threat to international peace and security, provided that\r\nall preventive or pre-emptive measures together with other\r\nundertakings, such as international arbitration and mediation\r\nin conflicts and the assignment of a role to regional\r\norganizations to find adequate solutions to conflict, have all\r\nfailed.\r\nIt is unfortunate that many States, particularly\r\ninfluential States in the Security Council, rode roughshod\r\nover these standards and began imposing coercive\r\neconomic and political measures against other States. This\r\nwas done for no other reason than the refusal by those\r\nStates to acquiesce to the will of hegemonic States on the\r\ninternational political scene. Experience has already\r\nshown that these States care for nothing other than their\r\nown narrow national interests when dealing with\r\nimportant international issues.\r\nDifferences of opinion between States are in the\r\nnature of things. What is not normal is for some States to\r\nregard these differences as a basis for adopting policies\r\nthat run counter to international law with a view to\r\nforcing other countries to change their political and\r\neconomic approach in a way that would make them\r\nresponsive to the political or economic approach followed\r\nby the States that impose these policies. That is so even\r\nif this approach runs completely counter to the interests\r\nof the countries on which coercive political and economic\r\nmeasures are imposed.\r\nWe believe that the General Assembly, which\r\nrepresents the will of the international community, is the\r\nappropriate forum in which to discuss this important and\r\ncritical question.\r\nMy delegation therefore calls on all Member States\r\nto pool their efforts in order to stand up to the policies of\r\nimposing coercive economic and political measures —\r\npolicies that would not shy away from using food and\r\nmedicine as a weapon to bring political pressure to bear\r\non countries that are trying to break out of dependency\r\nand to safeguard the independence of their political\r\ndecision-making. All of these are rights guaranteed to all\r\nStates by the Charter and by the principles and custom of\r\ninternational law.\r\nMrs. Bashir (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt is a tribute to the Assembly that it provides an\r\nimportant rostrum for weak States to be heard — States\r\ntargeted by the forces of aggression and injustice.\r\nOnce again, the Assembly is today debating the\r\nunilateral use by a major Power of coercive political and\r\neconomic measures as a means of putting pressure on\r\nother sovereign States in an attempt to coerce them into\r\ndependence.\r\nAt the last session, in resolution 52/181, the General\r\nAssembly expressed deep concern because the unilateral\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nuse of such measures adversely affects the economies and\r\nthe development efforts of developing countries. Moreover,\r\nsuch measures have a negative impact on international\r\neconomic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to institute\r\na non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system.\r\nIn the same resolution, the General Assembly urged the\r\ninternational community to adopt urgent effective measures\r\nto stop the use by some developed States of coercive\r\neconomic measures against developing States in order to\r\navoid a contradiction with the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nAt last session\u0027s debate, it was demonstrated that such\r\ncoercive economic measures are illegal and that they run\r\ncounter to the most fundamental principles of peaceful\r\ncoexistence and international economic cooperation. They\r\nalso contradict the international consensus on the need for\r\na more open, non-discriminatory world trading system, and\r\ncall into question the credibility of the noble standards of\r\ntrust and the supremacy of the rule of law, which are\r\nimportant underpinnings of international relations and of\r\nrelations between States.\r\nThe United States of America has ignored numerous\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions; in fact, it has expanded its\r\nuse of these coercive economic measures, to the point that\r\nnow there are more than 70 States, including my country,\r\nagainst which the United States Administration has issued\r\npresidential decrees. The political motivation for this\r\ncoercive United States action has sent the wrong message\r\nto insurrectionist movements in my country; this in turn has\r\nhampered the peace talks that were under way in Nairobi\r\nwhen the United States decree was issued.\r\nThe United States continued its aggression against\r\nSudan when, on 20 August 1998, it launched a missile\r\nattack on a plant producing human and veterinary\r\npharmaceuticals, located in the heart of our capital,\r\nKhartoum. The United States justified its heinous crime\r\nwith empty arguments and baseless allegations which\r\nlacked any proof. The United States Administration still\r\nrejects Sudan\u0027s call — which enjoys the support of the\r\noverwhelming majority of Member States — for the\r\nSecurity Council to send a fact-finding mission to look into\r\nthese allegations.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation reaffirms that the use of\r\nsuch coercive economic measures violates the principle of\r\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of States, their\r\nnational sovereignty, and their political and development\r\nchoices based on their own economic and cultural criteria.\r\nMy delegation also affirms that ignoring General Assembly\r\nresolutions calling for an end to such measures can only\r\nhamper — indeed, destroy — the principles of dialogue\r\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes between States.\r\nMy delegation will vote in favour of draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.7/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Nejad-Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nPowerful transnational forces are at work reshaping the\r\nkey features of world markets in capital, goods, services,\r\nlabour and technology. As discussed in detail here in the\r\nAssembly in the course of the two-day high-level\r\ndialogue back in September, the twin processes of\r\nglobalization and liberalization have expanded and\r\ndeepened the mutual interdependence of societies, which\r\nhas in turn increased the potential for international\r\ninteraction and cooperation. In such an environment,\r\nrecourse to unilateral and extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures is a serious threat to the basic\r\nprinciples and the foundations of the international\r\neconomic, trade and financial system.\r\nThe impermissibility under international law of\r\nunilateral and extraterritorial sanctions against other\r\ncountries is uniformly recognized by the international\r\ncommunity. The adoption of coercive economic measures\r\nfalls within the mandate of the United Nations only in\r\nparticular situations where there exists a threat to the\r\npeace or a breach of the peace. Moreover, several relevant\r\nprinciples set forth in the Charter provide a solid basis for\r\nthe Organization to offset the exercise of unilateral\r\nsanctions by individual States. United Nations\r\ndocumentation against unilateral action is comprehensive.\r\nAccording to General Assembly resolutions, unilateral\r\ncoercive measures violate the principles of non-\r\nintervention, non-interference in the internal and external\r\naffairs of other States, and the exercise by States of their\r\nsovereign rights. In this regard, both paragraph 2 of the\r\nDeclaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the\r\nDomestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their\r\nIndependence and Sovereignty, resolution 2131 (XX) of\r\n21 December 1965, and article 32 of the Charter of\r\nEconomic Rights and Duties of States, resolution 3281\r\n(XXIX) of 12 December 1974, stipulate that\r\n“No State may use or encourage the use of\r\neconomic, political or any other type of measures to\r\ncoerce another State in order to obtain from it the\r\nsubordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights”,\r\nwith the former Declaration adding “or to secure\r\nfrom it advantages of any kind”.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nMoreover, the General Assembly has denounced on\r\nvarious occasions unilateral and extraterritorial economic\r\ncoercion as a means of achieving political goals.\r\nResolutions on economic measures as a means of political\r\nand economic coercion against developing countries\r\nadopted at the forty-fourth, forty-sixth, forty-eighth, fiftieth\r\nand fifty-second sessions of the General Assembly, and the\r\nresolution entitled “Elimination of coercive economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic compulsion”\r\nadopted at the fifty-first session are prominent examples of\r\nthe series of United Nations responses to such unlawful\r\nactions.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe imposition of coercive economic measures and the\r\nenactment of domestic legislation with extraterritorial\r\nimplications for the horizontal escalation of such actions\r\nand measures also contradict provisions of established\r\ninternational trade law, including those under World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) regulations.\r\nVarious forms of coercive economic measures and\r\nactions were imposed against 79 foreign countries, in\r\nparticular developing countries, between 1979 and 1992,\r\nand from 1993 to 1996 unilateral sanctions were imposed\r\nno fewer than 61 times against 35 countries. These statistics\r\nindicate that recourse to such measures and actions has\r\nbeen on the rise in terms of number, and that these\r\nmeasures have intensified in severity in recent years. The\r\nnature of such illegal measures has also changed; for\r\nexample, they now take the form of measures with\r\nextraterritorial implications against the trade and investment\r\npartners of targeted countries. This unfortunate development\r\nand the consequent violation of the sovereignty of other\r\nStates have recently taken on dangerous dimensions. They\r\ncontravene the principle of territoriality of national laws and\r\nthe legitimate interests of companies and persons falling\r\nunder their jurisdiction.\r\nRecourse to unilateral measures has had a serious\r\nadverse impact on the economic, trade and financial\r\nrelations of countries from both North and South with the\r\ntargeted developing countries. The main targets, however,\r\nare companies and legal persons and entities of these very\r\ncountries which are prohibited from engaging in economic,\r\ncommercial and financial relations with targeted countries.\r\nSuch actions create serious distortions in the international\r\neconomy, impede an expansion of North-South and South-\r\nSouth relations, hinder regional cooperation among\r\ndeveloping countries and impose tremendous costs on other\r\nregional countries in their endeavours towards integration\r\nin the international economy.\r\nIn almost all United Nations resolutions and\r\ndecisions on financial and commercial issues and related\r\nfinancial declarations and conclusions of high-level\r\nmeetings in the entire system, the critical need for an\r\nequitable, rule-based, secure, non-discriminatory and\r\npredictable multilateral trading system has been\r\nemphasized. The necessity of a favourable and conducive\r\ninternational economic and financial environment and a\r\npositive investment climate as a means to facilitate and\r\npromote the participation of developing countries in\r\ninternational trade and finance has also been endorsed\r\nyear after year by Member States by consensus. These\r\ninstruments have, inter alia, invariably called on all\r\ncountries to abolish all measures which could impede free\r\ninternational trade and financial transactions. The\r\ncommitment to uphold and strengthen the multilateral\r\ntrading system for the economic and social advancement\r\nof all countries and peoples was reaffirmed and renewed\r\nin the ministerial communiqué of the high-level segment\r\nof the 1998 substantive session of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, held in July this year.\r\nOn the basis of these principles and commitments,\r\nthe international community has vigorously reacted to\r\nthese illegal measures and actions. Developed countries\r\nhave also discussed and rejected the enactment of these\r\nillegal instruments within various existing coordination\r\nframeworks among themselves and have used\r\ninternational and intergovernmental mechanisms to pre-\r\nempt recourse to such measures. The adoption in\r\nNovember 1996 by the Council of Ministers of the\r\nEuropean Union of a regulation and a joint action to\r\nprotect the interests of natural or legal persons residing in\r\nthe European Union against extraterritorial legislation is\r\na case in point. Developing countries have also\r\nindividually enacted legal measures rendering any foreign\r\nlegislation which is directly or indirectly aimed at\r\nrestricting or impeding the free flow of trade and\r\ninvestment to the detriment of any country inapplicable\r\nand without legal effect within their national territories.\r\nThe same has taken place in regional, intergovernmental\r\nand international meetings among developing countries.\r\nThe twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nin Durban; the thirty-fourth regular Assembly of Heads of\r\nState and Government of the Organization of African\r\nUnity in Ouagadougou; the eighth session of the Islamic\r\nSummit Conference in Tehran; and the twenty-second\r\nannual meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nGroup of 77 and China in New York have all rejected\r\nrecourse to such illegal unilateral and extraterritorial\r\nmeasures. It is also worth mentioning that consideration of\r\nthis crucial issue at all recent international conferences,\r\nsummits and other high-level meetings is a manifestation of\r\nthe multidimensional character of these unlawful measures\r\nwhich adversely affect all countries and the global economy\r\nas a whole.\r\nFinally, the legislation known as the Iran and Libya\r\nSanctions Act is an obvious example of extraterritorial\r\ncoercive economic measures. It is a United States domestic\r\ninstrument without any foundation in international law\r\nwhich has targeted the economic, commercial and financial\r\nrelations of other countries with the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran. As is fully known and has been further corroborated\r\nby recent developments, external pressures on oil\r\ncompanies to stay away from investing in the development\r\nof Iranian oil and gas projects has not encountered success.\r\nMoreover, that legislation, whose enactment is known to be\r\na product of domestic politicking, contradicts the provisions\r\nof the Declaration of Principles of International Law\r\nconcerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among\r\nStates. We call upon all the Member States of the United\r\nNations to refrain from recourse to such measures and to\r\nnullify any already in place. In our view, the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Elimination of coercive economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic compulsion”\r\nis an appropriate response on the part of the General\r\nAssembly to such unlawful and illegal measures. It\r\nrepresents our collective commitment to the principles,\r\ngoals and objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations, recognized principles and norms of international\r\nlaw and the provisions of the existing related international\r\ninstruments. It deserves to be adopted by consensus by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The discussion of agenda item 51 provides the\r\nopportunity for us to speak very briefly on the problem of\r\neliminating coercive economic measures used to exert\r\npolitical and economic pressure. This raises once again the\r\nthorny issue of sanctions.\r\nAs we know, sanctions were originally among the\r\npolitical means to which States could resort in order to\r\nmake recalcitrant members of the international community\r\nlisten to reason. Relevant international law has done\r\neverything possible to incorporate sanctions into the arsenal\r\nof political and legal coercive measures. However, since the\r\nfounding of the United Nations, sanctions have tended to be\r\nan exception among exceptions, in that they were intended\r\nto be used with great caution and discretion, as is the case\r\nwith any weapon. This means that they should be used\r\nonly once peaceful means, such as negotiation, mediation\r\nand conciliation, have been exhausted. It is in this sense\r\nthat the Charter of the United Nations clearly spells out\r\nin Article 2, paragraph 3, that:\r\n“All Members shall settle their international disputes\r\nby peaceful means in such a manner that\r\ninternational peace and security, and justice, are not\r\nendangered.”\r\nBut it is precisely economic sanctions that are most\r\nunjust and the most harmful, because of their contagious\r\neffects and the insidious damage they inflict. If a country\r\ncannot for four, five or six years export its products or\r\nobtain foodstuffs from abroad, imagine the suffering of\r\nthe people of that country. The paradox is this: the quest\r\nto punish a State for a serious failing or for an offence it\r\nhas committed — in other words, because an injustice has\r\ntaken place — results in another injustice: starving a\r\npopulation that, in terms of the scale of responsibility, is\r\ncompletely innocent. Herein lies the iniquity of economic\r\ncoercion.\r\nIn the case of Libya, which for seven years now has\r\nbeen a classic example, it is the Libyan people who have\r\nbeen paying a high price in the form of the many\r\nprivations they must endure daily. This is an absurd\r\nsituation. The attempt to right the wrongs caused by the\r\ntragedy of Pan Am flight 103 has succeeded only in\r\ncreating more suffering: that of the families of the victims\r\nof this tragedy, who continue to live with the frustration\r\nof unanswered questions and especially the knowledge\r\nthat the matter has now become a problem between\r\nStates; and that of the Libyan people, who are wondering\r\nwhy they should experience such misfortune.\r\nBased primarily on these humanitarian\r\nconsiderations, the African heads of State, on their part,\r\ndecided on the elimination of unjust and unilateral\r\neconomic measures against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nThey noted further that the effects of those measures had\r\nspilled over beyond the region of the country involved, in\r\nviolation of international law, and thereby endangered the\r\ninterests of other countries, in particular those of the\r\ndeveloping countries. They stated also that those measures\r\nwere at the root of the economic and social ills suffered\r\nby neighbouring countries and peoples.\r\nI have spoken only of Africa here, but it is clear that\r\ncriticism of such measures is now very widespread. The\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, for instance, at its most recent\r\nsummit in South Africa recalled the unjust nature of\r\neconomic coercion. Eminent voices such as those of His\r\nHoliness John Paul II have spoken out against these same\r\nmeasures, in particular those against Cuba. For all these\r\nreasons, we should support draft resolution A/53/L.7/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nAs Chairman of the Islamic Group, I have the honour to\r\nspeak today on item 51 of the agenda of the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly, entitled “Elimination of\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion”.\r\nAllow me at the outset to extend to Mr. Opertti\r\nsincere congratulations on his election as President of the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly and to wish him\r\nevery success. I am fully confident that his experience and\r\nstatesmanship will stand us in good stead in the conduct of\r\nour work.\r\nAt a time when we are looking forward to entering the\r\ntwenty-first century in a spirit of tolerance, amity and\r\nbrotherhood among all humankind, the elimination of\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion has become an urgent need in order\r\nto get rid of the effects of the use of force and the\r\nconfrontational thinking that prevailed in international\r\nrelations during the cold-war era. These were a stumbling-\r\nblock on the path of the economic development of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nCoercive economic measures run counter to the\r\n“Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning\r\nFriendly Relations and Cooperation among States in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations”,\r\nadopted by the General Assembly on 24 October 1970 by\r\nresolution 2625 (XXV), which states that\r\n“No State or group of States has the right to\r\nintervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason\r\nwhatever, in the internal or external affairs of any\r\nother State. Consequently, armed intervention and all\r\nother forms of interference or attempted threats against\r\nthe personality of the State or against its political,\r\neconomic and cultural elements, are in violation of\r\ninternational law.” (see resolution 2625 (XXV), annex,\r\npara. 1)\r\nThe Declaration also states that\r\n“No State may use or encourage the use of\r\neconomic, political or any other type of measures to\r\ncoerce another State in order to obtain from it the\r\nsubordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights\r\nand to secure from it advantages of any kind.”\r\n(ibid.)\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 51/22 recalled its\r\nnumerous resolutions in which it called upon the\r\ninternational community to take urgent and effective steps\r\nto end coercive economic measures, and expressed grave\r\nconcern over the recent enactment of extraterritorial\r\ncoercive economic laws in contravention of the norms of\r\ninternational law, the aims and purposes of the United\r\nNations and the relevant provisions of the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nThat resolution reaffirmed the inalienable right of\r\nStates to economic and social development and to choose\r\ntheir political, economic and social system on the basis of\r\nthe international Organization\u0027s commitment to the\r\nconsolidation of the rights of peoples embodied in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law, in the\r\ninterest of achieving the Organization\u0027s objectives of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe Islamic Group, proceeding from the precepts of\r\nits glorious religion, its profound belief in the\r\nestablishment of justice among humankind and its\r\nadherence to the principles of international law, in\r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and its\r\nnoble objectives calling for the immediate elimination of\r\nextraterritorial, unilateral laws, urges the international\r\ncommunity to promptly take steps to put an end to the\r\nuse of unilateral measures against developing countries.\r\nHere I should like to recall resolution 15/8 adopted by the\r\neighth Islamic Summit Conference, held in Tehran from\r\n9 to 11 December 1997. It reaffirmed that unilateral\r\nmeasures affecting other parties and the attempt to\r\nenforce domestic law in the territories of other States are\r\nin contravention of the principles of international law\r\ngoverning relations among States and the United Nations\r\nCharter, which sets forth the obligation of all States not\r\nto interfere in the internal affairs of other States and to\r\nsettle their disputes by peaceful means.\r\nThe resolution called on States, inter alia, to\r\nconsider the so-called D\u0027Amato Act in contravention of\r\ninternational law and norms and to regard it as null and\r\nvoid. In this regard, I also would like to recall paragraph\r\n69 of the final communiqué of the twenty-fifth session of\r\nthe Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Organization\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nof the Islamic Conference, held in Doha, Qatar, from 15 to\r\n17 March 1998. Inspired by the aforementioned principles,\r\nin this paragraph:\r\n“The Conference reaffirmed its solidarity with\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the Great Socialist\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya for their position concerning\r\nthe so-called D\u0027Amato Law and rejected any arbitrary\r\nor unilateral measure, whether political or legal\r\napplied by one country against another one. It urges\r\nall States to consider this law which is against the\r\ninternational law and norms, as null and void.”\r\nVoting in favour of the draft resolution before us\r\ntoday is an imperative dictated by our responsibility to\r\nadhere to the provisions and principals of international law\r\nand to achieve the noble aims of the United Nations\r\nCharter, while taking full account of the general principles\r\ngoverning the international trade system and trade policies\r\nfor development which are included in the relevant\r\nresolutions, norms and provisions of the United Nations and\r\nthe World Trade Organization.\r\nMr. Li Hyong Chol (Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea): The delegation of the Democratic People\u0027s Republic\r\nof Korea believes that the discussion of agenda item 51,\r\nentitled “Elimination of coercive economic measures as a\r\nmeans of political and economic compulsion” is very timely\r\nand significant, as it reflects the current international\r\nsituation. Elimination of unilateral coercive economic\r\nmeasures is a fundamental condition for the establishment\r\nof democratic and equitable international economic\r\nrelations.\r\nToday, power politics still remain intact, even though\r\nhumankind is at the threshold of a new millennium after the\r\ncold war. This reality indeed casts a gloom over the\r\nprospects for international relations and also runs counter to\r\nthis era\u0027s trend towards a peaceful and just new world. As\r\nreality shows, coercive economic measures serve only as\r\ntools of power politics.\r\nSanction measures now being applied cannot and\r\nshould not be tolerated, either in view of their purpose,\r\npursuing political and economic pressure, or of the\r\nunacceptable logical and legal grounds used to justify their\r\napplication and their catastrophic consequences.\r\nIn this connection, the international community should\r\npay serious attention to the question of upon whom and on\r\nwhat grounds the sanctions are imposed, and it should work\r\nout a fair solution. In many instances, the target States of\r\nthe sanctions are small States whose social systems and\r\npolitical policies and positions are alleged to be reason for\r\nsanctions. It is both serious and deplorable that the\r\nsituation, which is characterized by coercive sanctions and\r\ndomination by power, has been created as a result of\r\nextraterritorial and arbitrary laws and acts on the part of\r\ncertain big Powers.\r\nThe use of forcible means in pursuit of political aims\r\nis a clear violation of the purposes of the United Nations\r\nCharter, the principles of international law, resolutions of\r\nthe General Assembly and the declarations and\r\nprogrammes of action of major international conferences.\r\nChapter I, Article 1 of the Charter establishes that\r\nthe development of friendly relations based on respect for\r\nthe principle of equal rights and self-determination and\r\nachieving international cooperation in solving international\r\nproblems of an economic, social and cultural character\r\nshould be the main purpose of relations between the\r\ncountries. In addition, article 32 of the Charter of\r\nEconomic Rights and Duties of States, contained in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 3281 (XXIX), states that\r\n“No State may use or encourage the use of\r\neconomic, political or any other type of measures to\r\ncoerce another State in order to obtain from it the\r\nsubordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”\r\nIn particular, the just demand of the developing\r\ncountries and their efforts to include the issue of ending\r\nunilateral coercive economic measures in the agenda of\r\nthe General Assembly has been met since 1989.\r\nAccordingly, a number of resolutions and decisions —\r\nsuch as resolution 51/22 on “Elimination of coercive\r\neconomic measures as a means of political and economic\r\ncompulsion” and resolution 52/181 on “Unilateral\r\neconomic measures as a means of political and economic\r\ncoercion against developing countries” — were adopted\r\nin subsequent Assembly sessions.\r\nIn addition, the declarations and programmes of\r\naction adopted at such major conferences of the United\r\nNations as the World Summit for Social Development and\r\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, held in recent\r\nyears, condemned unilateral economic-sanction measures\r\nas acts of interference in the internal affairs of the\r\nsovereign States as well as gross human rights violations,\r\nand they called for the repealing of such coercive\r\nmeasures and laws.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nHowever, in disregard of the requirements of the\r\ncurrent era, certain countries still continue to resort to\r\nfrequent imposition of economic sanctions upon developing\r\ncountries as a means of coercive political and economic\r\npressure. This is an unpardonable challenge to the\r\ninternational community which can never be justified.\r\nThe most prolonged and severe coercive economic\r\nmeasures of this kind in our century are none other than the\r\nunilateral economic sanctions and blockade imposed by the\r\nUnited States upon the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea. By means of more than a dozen laws, such as the\r\nTrading with the Enemy Act and Foreign Assets Control\r\nRegulations, legislated on 28 July and 17 December 1950\r\nrespectively, the United States has been continuously\r\nimposing comprehensive economic sanctions upon our\r\nRepublic and its population for almost half a century.\r\nWhat makes this more serious is that, even though\r\nfour years have elapsed since the conclusion by the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea and the United\r\nStates of America of the Agreed Framework — which, it\r\nwas hoped, would promote the improvement of relations\r\nbetween both countries — the United States has not taken\r\nsteps to lift the sanctions imposed upon us, thus failing to\r\nfulfil its commitment, and it has imposed further conditions\r\nfor lifting the sanctions. It continues to resort to a hostile\r\npolicy towards us.\r\nAll of this attests to the fact that the United States has\r\nbeen using economic sanctions as a hostile policy and a\r\nmeans of compulsion aimed at isolating and stifling our\r\nRepublic. If anachronistic pressure and blackmail continue\r\nto remain unchecked, they will present a dangerous element\r\nthat may bring about another type of cold war by inciting\r\nconfrontation and hostility among countries.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to reiterate that\r\nMember States of the United Nations should pay due\r\nattention to the early implementation of the United Nations\r\nresolutions concerning the elimination of sanctions as a\r\nmeans of political and economic pressure, including\r\nunilateral coercive economic measures against developing\r\ncountries, and they should make every effort to that end.\r\nMy delegation also urges that unilateral coercive\r\neconomic measures against developing countries should be\r\neliminated at an early date. At the same time, my\r\ndelegation is strongly opposed to the attempt to initiate and\r\nindefinitely maintain sanctions as a forcible means to\r\nchange legitimate political and economic systems of\r\nindividual countries.\r\nIn this regard, the delegation of the Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of Korea will vote in favour of the\r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/53/L.7/Rev.1.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to actively join in the efforts of the\r\ninternational community with a view to eliminating as\r\nearly as possible the unilateral coercive economic\r\nmeasures and establishing equitable international relations.\r\nMr. Vermeulen (South Africa): South Africa is\r\ncommitted to the principles of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates and the freedom of international trade. These\r\nfundamental principles guide my delegation in our\r\nconsideration of the draft resolution under agenda item\r\n51, concerning the elimination of coercive economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic\r\ncompulsion.\r\nThe Heads of State or Government of the Movement\r\nof Non-Aligned Countries addressed this very issue at the\r\ntwelfth summit meeting held in Durban on 2-3 September\r\n1998. On that occasion the Non-Aligned Movement\r\n(NAM) condemned the unilateral application of coercive\r\neconomic and other measures and the enactment of\r\nextraterritorial laws aimed at preventing developing\r\ncountries from exercising their right to freely decide their\r\nown political, economic and social systems.\r\nSouth Africa would like to reiterate and endorse the\r\ncall of the NAM Durban summit on all countries not to\r\nrecognize the unilateral or extraterritorial imposition of\r\nsanctions against other States and foreign companies or\r\nindividuals and to refrain from adopting such coercive\r\nmeasures as a means of exerting pressure on non-aligned\r\nor other developing countries.\r\nAs the leaders of NAM noted, these measures\r\nconstitute violations of international law and the Charter\r\nof the United Nations. They called on the international\r\ncommunity to take effective action to arrest the trend,\r\nincluding attempts to introduce or internationalize such\r\nextraterritorial measures through multilateral institutions\r\nor agreements, and they specifically rejected the trend\r\ngeared towards the strengthening of coercive unilateral\r\nmeasures through the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nMy delegation would like to reiterate and underline\r\nour opposition to all forms of unilateral coercive\r\nmeasures, and we will vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution before us.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): It gives me great pleasure to\r\nbe able to participate in this debate and to once again\r\nreiterate the position of the Government of the Republic of\r\nNamibia on this issue, which is of great importance to us.\r\nTwo years ago the General Assembly adopted\r\nresolution 51/22 of 27 November 1996, on the item entitled\r\n“Elimination of coercive economic measures as a means of\r\npolitical and economic compulsion”. The resolution calls\r\nfor the immediate repeal of unilateral extraterritorial laws\r\nwhich transcend national boundaries and impose sanctions\r\non companies and nationals of other States. It also calls\r\nupon other Member States not to recognize unilateral\r\nextraterritorial coercive economic measures or legislative\r\nacts imposed by any State.\r\nIt is regrettable that since the adoption of that\r\nresolution, the Member State concerned continues to apply\r\nextraterritorial coercive measures in defiance of the\r\ndemands of the international community. Despite the end of\r\nthe cold war, external interventions through dubious means\r\nstill persist. These interventions are being felt in most of\r\nthe developing countries, such as Libya and Cuba to\r\nmention only two.\r\nOn several occasions during the sessions of this body\r\nand in other international forums, Namibia has registered its\r\nstrong opposition to the laws enacted by a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations which seek to advance its political,\r\neconomic and military interests in countries of the\r\ndeveloping world, with a view to preventing those countries\r\nfrom exercising their inalienable rights to self-determination\r\nby freely choosing their political system and to determine\r\ntheir own path of economic, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment. The spirit and letter of these dubious laws\r\ncontravene the resolutions of the General Assembly, in\r\nparticular resolution 2131 (XX) of 21 December 1965, on\r\nthe inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of\r\nother States and the protection of their independence and\r\nsovereignty.\r\nThese extraterritorial laws also contravene resolution\r\n3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, which prevents the use\r\nof economic, political or any other means to coerce another\r\nState in order to obtain from it the subordination of the\r\nexercise of its sovereign rights.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation once again calls upon the\r\nUnited States of America to refrain from adopting or\r\nimplementing extraterritorial measures which are coercive\r\nin nature, such as the recent enactment of the Helms-Burton\r\nand the D\u0027Amato-Kennedy Acts, which constitute a blatant\r\nviolation of the principles of international law and the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe Government of Namibia — out of respect for\r\nthe sovereignty of other States, the non-interference in the\r\ninternal matters of other Member States, the promotion of\r\ninternational cooperation, peace and security, and the\r\ncreation and maintenance of just and mutually beneficial\r\nrelations among nations — will not entertain any\r\nunilateral measures by any State.\r\nIn the same vein, Namibia will also continue to work\r\nwith other peace-loving countries in the United Nations to\r\nfight against coercive economic measures which are\r\ndetrimental to the new world order, as signified by the\r\ndevelopment of the new global economy and liberal trade\r\nregimes.\r\nFinally, my delegation fully supports and will vote\r\nin favour of draft resolution A/53/L.7/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Gambari (Nigeria): In my capacity as\r\nChairman of the African Group for the month of October\r\n1998, I have the honour to address the General Assembly,\r\nat its fifty-third session, on agenda item 51, entitled\r\n“Elimination of coercive economic measures as a means\r\nof political and economic compulsion”.\r\nOn behalf of the African Group, I would like to\r\nrecall that, in its Final Communiqué, the most recent\r\nsummit meeting of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU), which took place in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso,\r\non 8 June 1998, addressed the necessity for the\r\nelimination of unjust economic measures as an instrument\r\nof economic and political coercion. Noting that the\r\nimplementation of coercive economic measures in many\r\ndeveloping countries has resulted in considerable social\r\nand economic deprivation for the citizenry, the summit\r\nrecommended, inter alia, that any extraterritorial measures\r\nused as a means of political and economic coercion be\r\nreviewed in such a way as to alleviate the negative impact\r\non the lives of innocent citizens, both in the target State\r\nand in the neighbouring countries.\r\nIt is a reality that sanctions are a tool of enforcement\r\nand, as such, they have the tendency to constrain the\r\neconomic and social life of the affected State. It is also a\r\nfact that sanctions regimes established by the United\r\nNations normally include humanitarian provisions.\r\nHowever, the implementation of the humanitarian\r\nprovisions related to international sanctions is often\r\ncumbersome and thereby leads to delays in the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nprocurement, delivery and distribution of essential\r\ncommodities, such as food and medicine. As a result, the\r\nmost vulnerable segments of the population — mostly\r\nwomen and children — are often those that are hit the\r\nhardest by the harmful effects of international sanctions.\r\nAllow me to make reference to the report of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/53/1), which, inter alia, welcomes the\r\nconcept of “smart sanctions”, which would be targeted at\r\npressuring Governments rather than ordinary people in the\r\ncountries concerned. The implementation of such a new\r\nconcept would surely encourage the tailoring of sanctions\r\nspecifically to protect the majority of the populace from\r\neconomic hardships.\r\nIn this connection, I would also like to draw attention\r\nto the open debate in the Security Council on the document\r\nentitled “Supplement to an Agenda for Peace: position\r\npaper of the Secretary-General on the occasion of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations”. In that\r\ndocument, former Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali put his\r\nfinger right on the contradictions which arise from the\r\nemployment of sanctions in efforts to maintain international\r\npeace and security. Several questions which were raised in\r\nthat debate are relevant to our discussion of agenda item 51\r\nin this Assembly.\r\nFirst, how do all we Members of the United Nations\r\nensure that sanctions are properly targeted at the decision-\r\nmakers, rather than at the general population, of the\r\ncountries concerned? Secondly, how do we make adequate\r\nprovisions to protect innocent civilians, who invariably\r\nsuffer disproportionately from the effect of international\r\nsanctions? Thirdly, how do we compensate the\r\nneighbouring States, which often bear the brunt of the\r\nenforcement of sanctions at great expense to their own\r\neconomies and even to their own domestic peace and\r\nstability? Finally, are we fully aware that the prolongation\r\nof sanctions against a country could have the unintended\r\neffect of producing greater intransigence and defiance from\r\nthe peoples and their respective Governments, which may\r\nindeed find ground by pleading that sanctions are an\r\ninternational conspiracy to unduly punish them?\r\nMoreover, the unilateral imposition of measures by\r\nsome countries on other States, in an attempt to influence\r\nthe domestic politics of the targeted country or countries,\r\ngive sanctions a very negative connotation and may very\r\nwell undermine their moral force.\r\nWe in the African Group believe that the\r\nrelationship between States Members of the United\r\nNations and the international community should become\r\nincreasingly more cooperative, rather than confrontational.\r\nIf they did, extraterritorial coercive economic measures as\r\na means of political and economic compulsion would be\r\ncompletely eradicated.\r\nThe African Group therefore supports the draft\r\nresolution before the General Assembly, which we hope\r\nwill give relief, both in economic and social terms, to the\r\nordinary citizens of affected countries. In this regard, we\r\nwish to note that, while it is the primary responsibility of\r\nthe Security Council to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity, that mandate must be exercised without\r\njeopardizing the well-being of the innocent, ordinary\r\ncitizens of any nation.\r\nThe General Assembly, moreover, has the\r\nresponsibility, not only to bring this fact to the attention\r\nof the Security Council and the international community\r\nas a whole, but also to adopt appropriate resolutions, such\r\nas the draft before us, to correct injustices resulting from\r\nthe imposition of unilateral, extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures.\r\nOn the part of my delegation, we shall certainly vote\r\nin favour of this draft resolution.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): My delegation is\r\nparticipating in this debate in order to join others in\r\nexpressing Malaysia\u0027s position on this important issue, as\r\nwe did on a related item pertaining to Cuba on 14\r\nOctober 1998.\r\nFrom the statements made in this Assembly today\r\nand in the past, and the responses received by the\r\nSecretary-General pursuant to a previous resolution of the\r\nAssembly on this subject, it is clear that there is\r\nconsiderable concern on the part of the international\r\ncommunity over the use of coercive economic measures\r\nas a means of political and economic compulsion. This\r\nconcern is based on the following compelling arguments.\r\nFirst, such coercive economic measures violate the\r\nestablished norms of relations among nations, including,\r\nin particular, those enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations and numerous relevant resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly. They violate the universal principles of the\r\nequal sovereignty of States and non-intervention in their\r\ninternal affairs.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nSecondly, they violate the letter and spirit of the\r\nAgreement Establishing the World Trade Organization and\r\nthe acknowledged objectives and purposes of many regional\r\neconomic or trade organizations, which, inter alia, uphold\r\nand promote the universal principles of international trade,\r\nin particular, the principles of non-discrimination and\r\nfreedom of international trade.\r\nThirdly, such unilateral measures are discriminatory in\r\nnature, intended to serve specific political agendas against\r\nthe target country or countries.\r\nFourthly, these measures have an extraterritorial\r\ndimension, in that they extend the application of domestic\r\nlaws to other countries.\r\nLike many delegations that have addressed the\r\nAssembly on this subject, Malaysia is against the\r\napplication of such extraterritorial coercive measures in\r\ninter-State relations. We fully subscribe to the final\r\ndocument of the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, held in Durban in September 1998, which, inter\r\nalia, called on all States to refrain from adopting or\r\nimplementing extraterritorial or unilateral measures of\r\ncoercion as a means of exerting pressure on non-aligned\r\nand other developing countries. It is clear that these\r\nmeasures are as unpopular as they are anachronistic — they\r\nare a throwback to a world of the past, characterized by its\r\ncold-war rigidity. They are out of step with the current\r\ntrend towards increasing interdependence as well as\r\ninteraction and interconnectedness among States, developed\r\nand developing, a trend impelled by a new and palpable\r\nuniversal sense of a truly global community. In an\r\nincreasingly borderless world in which global trade plays a\r\npivotal role in relations among States, there is really no\r\nplace or justification for the continuation of such policies.\r\nIn expressing Malaysia\u0027s support for draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.7/Rev.1, which was initiated by the delegation of\r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, my delegation joins the call\r\nfor the immediate repeal of such unilateral extraterritorial\r\nlaws, in particular the D\u0027Amato-Kennedy Act and the\r\nHelms-Burton Act, the main objectives of which are, inter\r\nalia, to restrict the target country\u0027s access to markets,\r\ncapital, technology and investment in order to maximize the\r\nintended negative impact of that policy on the country or\r\ncountries concerned. We urge the immediate repeal of such\r\nmeasures and their replacement with measures that are fair\r\nand consistent with the corpus of international laws,\r\nprinciples and regulations, in keeping with the spirit of our\r\ntime. Indeed, my delegation urges not only the immediate\r\nrejection or abandoning of these measures but an earnest\r\neffort on the part of the international community to forge\r\na new dynamic in relations among States that will\r\nanimate and define this new spirit of our time. In this\r\nregard, my delegation believes that the United Nations has\r\na unique role to play.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.7/Rev.1.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote\r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Burleigh (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States opposes the draft resolution proposed by\r\nLibya under agenda item 51, entitled “Elimination of\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion”. Member States should understand\r\nthat this draft resolution is not about unilateralism,\r\ncoercion, compulsion or extraterritoriality. This is an\r\nattempt by Libya to divert attention from its own non-\r\ncompliance with terrorism-related sanctions and to shift\r\nthe focus to those in the international community that\r\nseek to call States like Libya to account. The fact is that\r\nkey sanctions on Libya are imposed by the United\r\nNations. The Security Council reviews these sanctions\r\nevery 120 days and will conduct the twentieth such\r\nreview this week. After every review the Council has\r\ndetermined that conditions have not been met to lift\r\nsanctions.\r\nThe primary sponsor of this draft resolution has\r\nchosen not to respond positively to obligations imposed\r\nby international law, the United Nations Charter and the\r\nSecurity Council in several resolutions adopted under\r\nChapter VII. It would be unfortunate to reward its\r\nintransigence with support of this draft resolution.\r\nThe use of sanctions as an effective and appropriate\r\nforeign policy tool by States, multilateral organizations\r\nand the United Nations itself is worthy of discussion. But\r\nwhen it is raised in a condemnatory way in a body such\r\nas the General Assembly of the United Nations by a State\r\nthat does not respect Security Council resolutions, the\r\nsubject is unworthy of the attention of Member States.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nEvery sovereign State has the right to decide with\r\nwhom it will or will not trade. My Government regards\r\neconomic sanctions as a legitimate instrument of foreign\r\npolicy. The United States is by no means the only nation\r\nthat resorts to such measures when necessary. In fact,\r\napplying the logic of paragraph 2 of the draft resolution, the\r\ninternational community would never have imposed\r\neconomic sanctions against the Republic of South Africa to\r\nforce it to end the apartheid regime or against what was\r\nthen known as Rhodesia — what is now Zimbabwe.\r\nWhen faced with unacceptable international behaviour,\r\nthe United States resorts to unilateral economic action\r\nreluctantly. Whenever possible, we work with other\r\nmembers of the global community to devise a collective\r\nresponse to egregious behaviour that violates international\r\nnorms or threatens international security, as we did in the\r\nface of Iraq\u0027s armed aggression against its neighbour,\r\nKuwait. But the United States has responded and will\r\ncontinue to respond unilaterally when faced with policies\r\nand actions that pose unusual and extraordinary threats to\r\nits vital interests, including its security, such as State\r\nsupport for international terrorism, the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and of ballistic missiles and\r\nmassive human rights abuses. We do not take such action\r\nlightly. When forced to act, we make it clear what policies\r\nwe want to see changed and what the target State must do\r\nto have sanctions lifted.\r\nOur sanctions also seek to target the subject\r\nGovernment, while avoiding harm to vulnerable civilian\r\npopulations. For example, while enforcing a complete trade\r\nembargo against the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea, the United States is also one of the largest\r\ncontributors of humanitarian assistance to that nation.\r\nWe should also note that imposing economic sanctions\r\nentails real economic sacrifice on the part of the United\r\nStates. That the United States is willing to make such\r\nsacrifices indicates the great importance we place on the\r\nissues involved. In responding to rogue State behaviour, the\r\nUnited States is defending not only its own interests but the\r\nsecurity of the international community as a whole.\r\nMr. Tanç (Turkey): Turkey will vote in favour of\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.7/Rev.1 to demonstrate its\r\nopposition in principle to the extraterritorial application of\r\nnational legislation, which is not in accordance with the\r\ngeneral principles of international law. Our vote simply\r\nreflects that consideration. Turkey\u0027s vote, however, should\r\nnot be construed as an endorsement of any position or\r\npolicy adopted or pursued by the country submitting the\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nMr. Wrabetz (Austria): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The Central and\r\nEastern European countries associated with the European\r\nUnion — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia,\r\nLithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the\r\nassociated country, Cyprus, as well as the European Free\r\nTrade Association countries members of the European\r\nEconomic Area — Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway —\r\nalign themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union wishes to take this opportunity\r\nto emphasize its unequivocal rejection of attempts to\r\napply national legislation on an extraterritorial basis\r\ncontrary to international law. We have always rejected\r\nattempts by any country to coerce others into complying\r\nwith unilateral commercial measures. We stress that\r\nbinding sanctions can be imposed on States only by and\r\nunder the authority of the Security Council in accordance\r\nwith Article 41 of the United Nations Charter.\r\nWe wish to mention in this regard the legislation\r\nwhich provides for the application of legal sanctions to\r\ncompanies and individuals outside its national jurisdiction,\r\nincluding provisions designed to discourage third-country\r\ncompanies from trading with or investing in specific\r\ncountries. Measures of this type violate the general\r\nprinciples of international law and the sovereignty of\r\nindependent States.\r\nWe wish to reaffirm that the European Union\u0027s\r\nstrong opposition, based both on law and on principle, to\r\nthe imposition of secondary boycotts and legislation with\r\nextraterritorial effect and retroactivity remains unchanged;\r\nand we wish to state that the European Union has\r\nexercised its right to react as it deems appropriate to any\r\nextraterritorial measures which appear to contravene\r\ninternational law, and it will continue to do so.\r\nWe have made these points clear on several\r\noccasions during this session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe European Union must, however, make a firm and\r\nunmistakable distinction between measures imposed\r\nunilaterally by individual States and those which are\r\nundertaken with the authority of the Security Council or\r\notherwise justified under international law. Unfortunately,\r\nthe text before us today fails to make this distinction. The\r\nEuropean Union has accordingly concluded that it is\r\nunable to support the draft text and will abstain in the\r\nvoting.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in explanation of vote\r\nbefore the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.7/Rev.l.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Angola, Bahrain, Benin, Botswana, Brunei\r\nDarussalam, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape\r\nVerde, Central African Republic, Chad, China,\r\nColombia, Côte d\u0027Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea,\r\nEthiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic\r\nRepublic of), Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lao\r\nPeople\u0027s Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali,\r\nMauritania, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco,\r\nMozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria,\r\nOman, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Russian\r\nFederation, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone,\r\nSingapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname,\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo,\r\nTunisia, Turkey, Uganda, United Arab Emirates,\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, Venezuela, Viet Nam,\r\nYemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nIsrael, United States of America\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAndorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium,\r\nBhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile,\r\nCosta Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic,\r\nDenmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia,\r\nGermany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy,\r\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Liechtenstein,\r\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Micronesia (Federated\r\nStates of), Monaco, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand,\r\nNorway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal,\r\nRepublic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania,\r\nSaint Lucia, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon\r\nIslands, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, Uruguay, Uzbekistan\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.7/Rev.1 was adopted by 80\r\nvotes to 2, with 67 abstentions (resolution 53/10).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nmake statements in explanation of vote on the resolution\r\njust adopted. May I remind delegations that explanations\r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Duval (Canada) (interpretation from French):\r\nCanada abstained in the voting on draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.7/Rev.1. Canada has always been firmly opposed\r\nto extraterritorial measures aimed at limiting the freedom\r\nof trade and investment of third parties.\r\nWhile the resolution we have just considered\r\nrequires that unilateral extraterritorial laws imposing\r\nsanctions on third parties must be repealed, it fails to\r\ndistinguish clearly between measures taken under the\r\nauthority of the Security Council and in accordance with\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, and measures imposed\r\nunilaterally by States. Therefore, we have not been able\r\nto support the resolution.\r\nMs. Moglia (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Argentina abstained in the voting on the\r\nresolution just adopted because it takes the view that the\r\napplication of economic sanctions should be approved by\r\nthe pertinent United Nations organs and should be in\r\nconformity with the principles of the Charter.\r\nMr. Armitage (Australia): Australia draws a clear\r\ndistinction between sanctions imposed unilaterally on\r\nother countries by individual States and those sanctions\r\nthat are promulgated and implemented with the full\r\nauthority of the Security Council. This resolution does not\r\ndifferentiate sufficiently between those two very different\r\nsets of circumstances. Furthermore, it contains other\r\nlanguage which Australia considers problematic. In\r\nparticular, its reference to the inalienable right of every\r\nState to choose the political, economic and social system\r\nthat it deems most appropriate for the welfare of its\r\npeople appears to undermine the universality of\r\nfundamental human rights.\r\nFor these reasons, Australia abstained in the voting\r\non the resolution.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nMr. Hughes (New Zealand): New Zealand takes this\r\nopportunity to reiterate its long-standing opposition to\r\nnational legislation that imposes unilateral sanctions that\r\npurport to have extraterritorial effect on third States.\r\nThe resolution just adopted, however, does not\r\ndistinguish clearly between these unilateral sanctions and\r\nSecurity Council sanctions which are imposed legitimately\r\nunder the United Nations Charter and which must be\r\nsupported by all Member States.\r\nFor this reason, the New Zealand delegation abstained\r\nin the voting on the resolution.\r\nMr. Jordán Pando (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): On behalf of my delegation, I wish to explain\r\nwhy Bolivia did not vote in favour of the resolution just\r\nadopted, but rather abstained, thus maintaining its position\r\nof 1996 in a case which has implications beyond those\r\nconsidered.\r\nThis does not mean that Bolivia does not condemn and\r\nreject any extraterritorial measures applied unilaterally,\r\nsince they are a violation of international law.\r\nWe confirm our 1996 position and take the view that\r\nin this situation there are other considerations to be taken\r\ninto account.\r\nMr. Ri Kwang Nam (Democratic People\u0027s Republic\r\nof Korea): My delegation supported the resolution entitled\r\n“Elimination of coercive measures as a means of political\r\nand economic compulsion” because of its position of\r\nprinciple that all unilateral coercive economic measures\r\nshould be eliminated. In this regard, my delegation wants\r\nto clarify one point made by the United States a few\r\nmoments ago. The representative of the United States\r\nshould have expressed his country\u0027s apology for the\r\nunilateral coercive economic measures it has continuously\r\nimposed against our republic for the past 50 years, and\r\nshould then have described a plan for repealing these\r\nmeasures.\r\nMy delegation was disappointed by his elusive\r\nremarks, and resolutely rejects his arguments. To us, power\r\npolitics and coercive measures such as sanctions are\r\nsenseless. The United States sanctions can only serve the\r\npurpose of jeopardizing peace and security on the Korean\r\npeninsula by inciting confrontation and hostility. We\r\nstrongly urge that, instead of deceiving world public\r\nopinion and trying to rid itself of its responsibilities, the\r\nUnited States should immediately repeal all measures of\r\neconomic sanctions.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in explanation of vote on\r\nthis item.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 51?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nReports of the Fifth Committee\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe General Assembly will now consider the reports of\r\nthe Fifth Committee on agenda item 112, on agenda items\r\n112 and 119 and on agenda item 143 (a).\r\nIf there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly\r\ndecides not to discuss the reports of the Fifth Committee\r\nthat are before it today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nStatements will therefore be limited to explanations of\r\nvote or position.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the Fifth Committee have been made\r\nin the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official\r\nrecords. May I remind members that under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401 the Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered\r\nin a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a\r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote\r\nonly once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary\r\nmeeting unless that delegation\u0027s vote in plenary\r\nmeeting is different from its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I remind delegations too that, also in\r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401,\r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that we\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nare going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner\r\nas was done in the Committee, unless the Secretariat is\r\nnotified otherwise.\r\nAgenda item 112\r\nReview of the efficiency of the administrative and\r\nfinancial functioning of the United Nations\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (Part I) (A/53/521)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe Assembly will take action on two draft decisions\r\nrecommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 7 of its\r\nreport (A/53/521).\r\nWe turn first to draft decision I, entitled “Activities of\r\nthe Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions during the fifty-second session of the General\r\nAssembly”. The Fifth Committee adopted draft decision I\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to\r\ndo the same?\r\nDraft decision I was adopted.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nDraft decision II, entitled “Administrative arrangements for\r\nthe International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO”, was\r\nadopted by the Fifth Committee without a vote. May I take\r\nit that the Assembly too wishes to adopt the draft decision?\r\nDraft decision II was adopted.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nagenda item 112.\r\nAgenda items 112 (continued) and 119\r\nReview of the efficiency of the administrative and\r\nfinancial functioning of the United Nations\r\nHuman resources management\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/53/533)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe General Assembly will now take action on the draft\r\nresolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in\r\nparagraph 7 of its report (A/53/533). The draft resolution,\r\nentitled “Gratis personnel provided by Governments and\r\nother entities”, was adopted by the Fifth Committee\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the General Assembly\r\nwishes to adopt the draft resolution?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 53/11).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nagenda items 112 and 119.\r\nAgenda item 143\r\nAdministrative and budgetary aspects of the financing\r\nof the United Nations peacekeeping operations\r\n(a) Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/53/522)\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe Assembly will take a decision on the draft resolution\r\nrecommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 8 of\r\nits report (A/53/522).\r\nI call now on the representative of the United States,\r\nwho wishes to speak in explanation of position before\r\naction is taken on the draft resolution.\r\nMr. Squadron (United States of America): When\r\nthe General Assembly discussed the peacekeeping support\r\naccount agenda item at the resumed fifty-second session\r\nlast May, my delegation made it clear that the entire\r\npeacekeeping backstopping function needed a\r\ncomprehensive review. This includes posts in the\r\nDepartment of Political Affairs and the Department of\r\nManagement, as well as the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations and other sections of the Secretariat. When the\r\nUnited States joined consensus in June on a compromise\r\nthat established 400 posts for the support account and\r\nauthorized $34.4 million for the year 1 July 1998 to 30\r\nJune 1999, we did so with the belief — a belief that was\r\nexplicitly spelled out in the resolution — that the\r\nSecretariat would conduct its own review of the support\r\naccount posts.\r\nAt the same time, the United States noted that in the\r\npast few years the support account submission by the\r\nSecretary-General has continued to increase, while the\r\nnumber, size and cost of peacekeeping operations have\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\ndeclined dramatically. The Secretariat has also underspent\r\nby about $2 million annually what it has been authorized by\r\nthe General Assembly to spend from the support account.\r\nThe United States does not believe there is a linear, one-to-\r\none relationship between the level of peacekeeping\r\noperations in the field and the level of backstopping\r\nrequired at Headquarters. However, it is illogical and\r\nunrealistic that a substantial decrease in the field would not\r\nhave any impact at all on the needs at Headquarters.\r\nThe situation has not changed. The Secretariat did not\r\npresent any new information to the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions or the General\r\nAssembly for consideration at its fifty-third session. The\r\nUnited States again calls on the Secretary-General to\r\nengage in a comprehensive, post-by-post review of the\r\npeacekeeping support account in the context of his\r\nsubmission for the 1999-2000 support account year.\r\nTurning to the present draft resolution, the United\r\nStates believes that redeployment is a critical management\r\ntool that is essential to make the backstopping function at\r\nHeadquarters more effective and efficient. The size of\r\ncurrent peacekeeping operations, changes in work methods\r\nand the absence of start-ups or shut-downs of major\r\nmissions make it essential that the Secretariat look closely\r\nat the distribution of posts and redeploy to match the needs.\r\nThe General Assembly was told by representatives of the\r\nSecretariat — sceptically, I might add — that they would\r\ntry to redeploy posts if instructed to do so by the General\r\nAssembly. It is not good enough for the Secretariat to try.\r\nIt has been given a mandate by the General Assembly, and\r\nit must take a hard-nosed, critical look at its current and\r\nexpected needs and readjust the staffing pattern accordingly.\r\nThe United States also calls on the Secretary-General,\r\nwhen filling the 400 support account posts that have again\r\nbeen authorized, to include within them those functions that\r\nhe identified as critical to the backstopping function and\r\nrequiring current military or civilian police expertise. The\r\nUnited States remains concerned that the transition between\r\nthe gratis military personnel and their replacements, both\r\ncivilians and seconded military and police officers, should\r\ntake place seamlessly and with no gap in capability. The\r\nwelfare of our peacekeepers is literally on the line. It would\r\nbe unconscionable to endanger them because of a staffing\r\ngap.\r\nThe United States remains committed to the important\r\nwork done by the peacekeepers of the United Nations. We\r\nstand ready to work with the Secretariat and other\r\ndelegations to ensure that this work is done efficiently\r\nand effectively.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nThe General Assembly will now take a decision on the\r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in\r\nparagraph 8 of its report (A/53/522).\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution,\r\nentitled “Support account for peacekeeping operations”,\r\nwithout a vote.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly wishes to\r\ndo likewise?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 53/12).\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nmake statements in explanation of position on the\r\nresolution just adopted.\r\nMr. Manz (Austria): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries associated with the European\r\nUnion — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia,\r\nSlovenia — and the associated country, Cyprus, as well\r\nas the European Free Trade Association country member\r\nof the European Economic Area, Iceland, align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nThe resolution just adopted is of great importance to\r\nthe European Union, since it has an immediate impact on\r\nthe safety of peacekeeping troops in the field.\r\nRepresenting the largest group of troop-contributing\r\ncountries, the European Union has been guided first and\r\nforemost in this debate by the principle of the need to\r\nprotect the lives of personnel in the field. They must not\r\nbe put at risk. Therefore, we acknowledge the need to\r\nstaff the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and\r\nother departments involved in backstopping peacekeeping\r\nadequately, not least to ensure adequate planning capacity\r\nand the ability to react swiftly to meet new challenges.\r\nThe European Union acknowledges the importance\r\nof replacing the gratis military officers with properly\r\nqualified people for the smooth functioning of\r\nbackstopping structures. It is vital that we do not lose the\r\nexpertise built up through the loan of those experienced\r\nofficers and those with whom they worked. Throughout\r\nthese past months, the European Union has emphasized\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nthe need for appropriate hand-over arrangements in order to\r\nensure continuity.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the General Assembly once again\r\nhad to spend so much time on this issue. While we regret\r\nthat inadequate information was provided by the Secretariat\r\nthroughout this long exercise and share the frustration of\r\nthe Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions (ACABQ) in this context, we recognize the\r\nSecretariat\u0027s last-minute efforts in the Fifth Committee. We\r\nare particularly grateful to the fresh approach of the\r\nMilitary Adviser of the Secretary-General. He confirmed\r\nour view that military expertise must be preserved, and we\r\ntrust that his expertise will be given due regard.\r\nWith regard to the number of posts we have given, it\r\nis perhaps of necessity arbitrary. This was inevitable given\r\nthe lack of information available on which to base a more\r\nconsidered view.\r\nThe European Union accepted the ACABQ\u0027s\r\nrecommendations. In order to reach consensus and meet the\r\nconcerns of other delegations, we agreed to seven posts in\r\naddition to the 393 recommended by the Advisory\r\nCommittee. Three of these have been allocated to the\r\nRapidly Deployable Mission Headquarters (RDMHQ) and\r\nthe Office of Internal Oversight Services. The remaining\r\nadditionally approved posts should go to priority areas.\r\nAgain, the European Union is particularly concerned\r\nabout the need for current seconded expertise. This\r\nresolution reaffirmed resolution 52/248, which requested the\r\nSecretary-General to ensure the required expertise of\r\nserving military officers and civilian police. In fact, if\r\nmilitary expertise is substantially reduced the entire\r\npeacekeeping area of the United Nations is bound to suffer\r\nirreparable loss, with consequences for the safety and\r\nsecurity of all the military and civilian personnel in the\r\nfield. We also hope that seconded military expertise can\r\neventually be extended to the RDMHQ, as requested by the\r\nSecretary-General and recognized by the ACABQ in\r\nparagraph 16 of its report contained in document A/53/418.\r\nThe European Union will look very closely at the next\r\nsubmission of the support account. In our view, this must\r\ninevitably reflect the significant restructuring of all\r\ndepartments dealing with peacekeeping backstopping, not\r\njust the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. With\r\nsomething like 70 fewer posts available to him, the\r\nSecretary-General must examine his real needs. We regard\r\nthis decision as an opportunity for the Secretariat to\r\nreassess backstopping needs. It must act as an engine to\r\npromote restructuring. The European Union expects the\r\nSecretary-General to ensure that the necessary\r\nredeployment will take place as soon as possible and that\r\nhe will report on the process of redeployment in the next\r\nsupport account report.\r\nOut of principle, we have refrained from engaging\r\nin micro-management. This resolution gives the\r\nSecretariat an unusual degree of flexibility to carry out\r\nrequired changes, and we look forward to seeing an\r\naccount of their implementation next year.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Norway supported the\r\nresolution just adopted, and we welcome the fact that\r\nresources were found to finance two of the eight posts\r\nrequested by the Secretary-General for the Rapidly\r\nDeployable Mission Headquarters. Norway has supported\r\nthe establishment of the Rapidly Deployable Mission\r\nHeadquarters since the idea was born and would also\r\nwelcome seeing the six military posts financed, as\r\nrequested by the Secretary-General and recognized by the\r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions.\r\nNorway shares the views expressed by the European\r\nUnion regarding the replacement of the gratis military and\r\npolice officers with qualified people and smooth and\r\ncareful hand-over arrangements to secure continuity,\r\nwhile ensuring the required expertise of serving military\r\nofficers and civilian police.\r\nMrs. Buergo Rodríguez (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): At the outset, my delegation wishes to thank the\r\ncoordinator for this item, the representative of Australia,\r\nMr. Miles Armitage, for the efforts he deployed\r\nthroughout the negotiations in order to achieve the\r\nadoption by consensus of this resolution.\r\nThe item on which we have adopted this resolution\r\nhas required a year of intensive work owing to the\r\nsensitivity of the issue and the political differences\r\nunderlying it. We were also faced with a deplorable\r\nsituation: the information provided on the item sometimes\r\nlacked coherence, precision and clarity. This undoubtedly\r\ngave rise to additional difficulties in the consideration of\r\nthe reports, both in the Fifth Committee and in the\r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions. Situations of this kind should not arise, and we\r\ntrust that they will not recur.\r\nThe resolution we have adopted today reaffirms the\r\ndecision taken by the Assembly last June to establish 400\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 43rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 26 October 1998\r\nsupport account-funded posts for the period from 1 July\r\n1998 to 30 June 1999. It also requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, when allocating those posts, to take into account\r\nthe provisions contained in this resolution, particularly\r\noperative paragraphs 7 and 8. This means that only two\r\ncivilian posts could be established for a rapidly deployable\r\nmission headquarters, not the eight originally asked for. We\r\ntake note of the explanations given in this regard by the\r\nSecretariat in the Fifth Committee.\r\nIt emerged clearly from the negotiations that there is\r\nnot yet any specific information that would truly justify that\r\nrequest. The Special Committee for Peacekeeping\r\nOperations itself still has doubts in this regard and has\r\nasked for more details about the differences in the\r\nfunctional responsibilities of the rapidly deployable mission\r\nheadquarters and the Mission Planning Service.\r\nMy delegation looks forward with interest to the\r\nnext report of the Secretary-General on the support\r\naccount so that it can consider this matter as well as the\r\nquestion of the review of possible duplication and overlap\r\nbetween the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and\r\nthe Department of Political Affairs. The latter was called\r\nfor by the General Assembly in its resolutions 50/214 and\r\n52/220, and once again in operative paragraph 10 of this\r\nresolution.\r\nFinally, we should like to underscore the important\r\nfact that all of the objective needs of support activities for\r\npeacekeeping operations at Headquarters should be at the\r\ncentre of the decision-making process on this item. This\r\nwill require genuine political will, and not an attempt to\r\nimpose positions that correspond to the political interests\r\nof certain Member States, which, far from working to the\r\nadvantage of the Organization, continues to undermine its\r\ntransparency and credibility.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nsub-item (a) of agenda item 143.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nshould like to draw the General Assembly\u0027s attention to\r\ndocument A/INF/53/3/Add.2, which covers the period\r\nfrom 26 October to 10 December and which was\r\ncirculated to delegations on Friday, 23 October.\r\nThe lists of speakers for the items mentioned in\r\ndocument A/INF/53/3/Add.2 are now open. In due course\r\nthe General Assembly will be informed of the dates for\r\nthe consideration of other agenda items and of any\r\nadditions or changes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
