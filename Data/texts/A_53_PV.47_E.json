(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 28 (continued)\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/458)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.12)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We shall\r\nnow proceed to consider draft resolution A/53/L.12.\r\nBefore proceeding to take action on the draft\r\nresolution, I have the pleasure of announcing that, since the\r\ndraft was introduced, the following countries have joined\r\nthe list of its co-sponsors: Belarus, Côte d’Ivoire, Israel,\r\nMali, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Suriname and\r\nUganda.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.12.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.12?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 53/13).\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In\r\nclosing our debate on the item under consideration, the\r\npresidency would like to comment on an element that it\r\ndeems vital to the strengthening of the ties that link the\r\nparliaments of the States Members of the Organization,\r\nthe organization of those parliaments — the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union — and the United Nations system\r\nitself.\r\nClearly, the ideals of cooperation and dialogue that\r\nled to the creation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union over\r\n100 years ago are today more important than ever. As a\r\nnumber of delegations have stressed, the parliaments of\r\nthe world — composed of men and women elected by the\r\npeople — represent a source and a focal point for the\r\nnecessary support that the United Nations ideals of peace,\r\ndemocracy and development must receive from all of its\r\nMembers.\r\nThe conference of speakers of national parliaments\r\nproposed for the year 2000, to be held in conjunction with\r\nthe Millennium Assembly at the United Nations, will no\r\ndoubt be an ideal and very welcome opportunity further\r\nto strengthen this cooperation, which has been fuelled and\r\nwill continue to be fuelled by timely actions and\r\nresolutions such as the one we have adopted today, with\r\nthe support of all States present.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n28?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nAgenda item 50\r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and\r\nOther Serious Violations of International Humanitarian\r\nLaw Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and\r\nRwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other\r\nSuch Violations Committed in the Territory of\r\nNeighbouring States between 1 January and 31\r\nDecember 1994\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nthird annual report of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal (A/53/429)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): May I\r\ntake it that the Assembly takes note of the third annual\r\nreport of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call on\r\nMr. Laïty Kama, President of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda.\r\nMr. Kama, President of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda (interpretation from French): I am\r\ngrateful for the opportunity to appear before the Assembly\r\nonce again to report on the activities of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda during the past year. The\r\nthird annual report, which I have the honour to submit to\r\nthe Assembly, details the Tribunal’s activities since July\r\n1997. It is the last report of the judges’ first term of office,\r\nwhich expires at the end of May 1999.\r\nIn my statement this afternoon, I will refrain from\r\ndiscussing at length the written report before the Assembly.\r\nI would particularly like, however — after a brief\r\ndescription of the Tribunal’s main judicial activities — to\r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to certain especially\r\nimportant matters directly related to the Tribunal’s\r\nfunctioning. These matters pertain to the places of\r\nimprisonment of convicted persons and to security.\r\nThe Tribunal was formally established by the Security\r\nCouncil on 8 November 1994. It is charged with\r\nprosecuting persons presumed responsible for acts of\r\ngenocide and other serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law committed in the territory of Rwanda in\r\n1994, in order to put an end to impunity and to promote\r\nnational reconciliation.\r\nIn fulfilling the mandate entrusted to them, the\r\njudges have consistently endeavoured to render fair and\r\nexpeditious justice, in accordance with article 19 of the\r\nStatute of the Tribunal. However, over and above the\r\nwell-known administrative difficulties it had to face at the\r\noutset, the Tribunal has also been confronted with\r\nlogistical problems in organizing trials, such as having\r\nonly one courtroom for the two Trial Chambers and the\r\nimperative need to ensure the protection of witnesses at\r\nall stages of trial proceedings. All this somewhat slowed\r\nthe work of the Tribunal during the first two years of its\r\nexistence. In that context, 1998 most certainly marks a\r\nvery positive change and, I believe, the beginning of a\r\nnew era for the Tribunal.\r\nSince the submission of the Tribunal’s second annual\r\nreport, judicial activities have increased considerably. The\r\nmuch awaited first judgement of the Tribunal was\r\ndelivered on 2 September 1998. It concerns the case of\r\nThe Prosecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu. It was closely\r\nfollowed on 4 September by the judgement and\r\nsentencing of Jean Kambanda, who was Prime Minister\r\nof the Interim Government of Rwanda in 1994.\r\nRegarding the judgement delivered on 2 September,\r\nthe Trial Chamber found Akayesu guilty on 9 counts out\r\nof 15, including genocide, direct and public incitement to\r\ncommit genocide and crimes against humanity.\r\nCommentators lauded this judgement as crucial for the\r\ndevelopment of international criminal justice, not only\r\nbecause it was the first judgement handed down by the\r\nTribunal for Rwanda, but also because it was the very\r\nfirst delivered by an international court in regard to the\r\ncrime of genocide. In this judgement — a voluminous\r\ndocument of nearly 300 pages, delivered simultaneously\r\nin the two working languages of the Tribunal — the Trial\r\nChamber ruled on certain matters of law that had never\r\nbefore been brought before an international court. It thus\r\nreviewed the law applicable to each of the crimes falling\r\nwithin its jurisdiction — that is, the crimes of genocide,\r\ncomplicity in genocide, direct and public incitement to\r\ncommit genocide, and violations of article 3 common to\r\nthe Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II\r\nthereto. In so doing, the Chamber defined some of the\r\nconstituent crimes of the offences falling within its\r\njurisdiction, particularly rape, since there was no\r\ncommonly accepted definition of this term in international\r\nlaw.\r\nThe Akayesu judgement brought to a close a trial\r\nthat had lasted more than a year. During the trial, the\r\nTrial Chamber heard 42 witnesses called by the parties —\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\ntestimony which generated more than 4,000 pages of\r\ntranscripts. The Chamber also considered 125 exhibits\r\nentered in evidence. After holding a pre-sentencing hearing\r\nin the Jean-Paul Akayesu case, on 2 October the Trial\r\nChamber sentenced him to life imprisonment.\r\nThe other major event was the sentencing, on 4\r\nSeptember 1998, in the case The Prosecutor v. Jean\r\nKambanda. The Trial Chamber, which had previously found\r\nthe former Prime Minister of Rwanda guilty, sentenced him\r\nto life imprisonment, after verifying the conditions under\r\nwhich he had pleaded guilty. A number of commentators\r\nalso viewed this judgement as historic, on the one hand\r\nbecause of the position of authority held by the accused,\r\nand on the other hand because a plea of guilty by a person\r\naccused of genocide before an international criminal court\r\nwas without precedent.\r\nIt should be underscored, however, that the guilty\r\nverdict and sentence against Akayesu and the life sentence\r\nimposed on Kambanda are not final since the convicted\r\nhave lodged appeals. It is therefore up to the Appeals\r\nChamber to make the final judgement.\r\nIn addition to the above, two other trials are under\r\nway. One case, The Prosecutor v. Clément Kayishema and\r\nObed Ruzindana, will soon enter the deliberations phase,\r\nthe Trial Chamber having started last week to hear the\r\nclosing arguments of the Prosecutor, which will be followed\r\nby those of the defence. The other case, The Prosecutor v.\r\nGeorges Rutaganda, has been delayed due to the health\r\nproblems of the accused and of his counsel. As a result, the\r\nTrial Chamber concerned has had to adjourn the\r\nproceedings several times. Hearings will resume as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nDespite these tangible achievements, the judges are\r\naware that much remains to be done, if only because, for\r\ninstance, 31 accused persons have been arrested by various\r\nStates and handed over to the Tribunal to be held in\r\ncustody at its detention facility in Arusha. To this number\r\nshould be added another accused who was recently arrested\r\nin Namibia and has since been transferred to Arusha.\r\nClearly, those still awaiting trial should be tried as soon as\r\npossible in order to comply with their fundamental right to\r\nbe tried within a reasonable amount of time.\r\nIn this regard, the judges wish to express their\r\nsatisfaction with the efforts made by the Prosecutor to\r\narrest accused or suspected persons. Indeed, principally\r\nunder the aegis of the new Deputy Prosecutor, several\r\narrests were made, notably in the course of an operation\r\ncarried out in cooperation with the Kenyan authorities in\r\nJuly 1997. I reported to the Assembly on this last year.\r\nThis operation resulted in the arrest of persons considered\r\nto have held positions of authority in Rwanda in 1994,\r\nincluding an ex-minister who is the first woman to be\r\nindicted by an international criminal court. In June of this\r\nyear, another operation in various West African countries\r\nresulted in the arrest and transfer to the Tribunal of six\r\nmore persons.\r\nI would like to welcome the cooperation extended by\r\nvarious countries involved in the two operations —\r\nKenya, Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and\r\nTogo. More generally, we should like to thank all those\r\ncountries that have supported us in our efforts to secure\r\njustice by giving a positive response to our requests for\r\ncooperation and assistance, whether by the judges or the\r\nProsecutor.\r\nHowever, the presence of all these detainees at the\r\nTribunal’s detention facility and the need to try them as\r\nsoon as possible have made the organization of the\r\njudicial calendar all the more difficult. Another\r\nconsequence of the increase in arrested indictees and the\r\nsignificant increase in the number of motions resulting\r\nfrom this increase was that the Tribunal soon found itself\r\noverloaded, and the two Trial Chambers were not\r\nsufficient to handle all the cases involved. Hence, the\r\nSecurity Council — at our request and after noting the\r\nprogress achieved by the Tribunal — decided, by its\r\nresolution 1165 (1998) of 30 April 1998, to establish a\r\nthird Trial Chamber. Thus the Council took due account\r\nof the difficulties faced by the judges in the fulfilment of\r\ntheir mandate, which had been rendered more\r\ncomplicated, as I have said, by the combined effect of a\r\nsteadily increasing number of detainees and the\r\nimperative to respect certain standards and principles\r\ngoverning the administration of justice. In its resolution,\r\nthe Security Council urged the organs of the Tribunal to\r\ncontinue their efforts to increase further the efficiency of\r\nthe Tribunal’s work and to consider how to enhance their\r\nwork procedures in order to speed up the proceedings.\r\nFirst, on improving in the way the Tribunal\r\nfunctions, it falls to the Registrar to rationalize\r\nadministrative procedures in the pursuit of greater\r\nefficiency. Although the judges are satisfied that\r\nconsiderable efforts have been made to improve the\r\nadministrative and logistical support given to the Trial\r\nChambers and the Prosecutor, it must be said that several\r\nproblems do remain, to which solutions must be found as\r\nrapidly as possible. Among the most urgent is the need to\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\ncomputerize the judicial archives, thus greatly facilitating\r\ntheir use, and the need to increase the number of legal\r\nadvisers assisting the Chambers. In this connection, we\r\nhope that the provisions contained in the draft budget\r\nbefore you pertaining to the creation of several posts for\r\nlegal officers at various levels will be approved. Moreover,\r\nit is essential that the third courtroom be finished as soon\r\nas possible so that the new judges can begin hearings as\r\nsoon as they arrive in Arusha.\r\nWith regard to procedural reforms intended to\r\naccelerate proceedings, the judges amended certain\r\nprovisions of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence at the\r\nfifth plenary session of the Tribunal for Rwanda, held in\r\nArusha from 1 to 5 June 1998. Among the numerous\r\namendments adopted, special mention could be made of\r\nthose relating to the modalities of pre-trial preparation,\r\nwhich should help speed up disclosure procedures between\r\nthe parties as to the number and order of appearance of\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution and the defence. The judges\r\nalso sanctioned a procedure well known in civil law\r\nwhereby the Trial Chamber pronounces both judgement as\r\nto guilt and the sentence at the same time, if need be,\r\ninstead of in two different stages, as had been the case up\r\nto now.\r\nThe Prosecutor had considered that another way of\r\nexpediting proceedings would be to join several cases.\r\nInitially, however, instead of filing motions for joinder, as\r\nshe had appeared resolved to do, the Prosecutor preferred\r\nto present a new indictment citing 29 persons, some of\r\nwhom had already been indicted and had made their initial\r\nappearances, and for some of whom the trial date had even\r\nbeen set. The judge to whom the indictment was submitted\r\nrejected it because of flawed procedure, and the\r\nprosecution’s subsequent appeal was declared inadmissible\r\nby the Appeals Chamber. Thereupon, the Prosecutor finally\r\nchose to file, in due form, several motions for joinder that\r\nthe Trial Chambers were prepared to hear. But the defence\r\nthen objected to the composition of the Chambers set up for\r\nthat purpose and appealed the decision taken to maintain it\r\nas it was. And so, consideration of the motions for joinder\r\nis suspended until the Appeals Chamber decision is known.\r\nOn this issue, I would stress that in spite of the fact\r\nthat certain motions were not dealt with as diligently as the\r\njudges of the Trial Chambers would have liked, the latter\r\nto date have handed down more than 150 decisions in\r\nregard to indictment procedures and witness protection\r\nmeasures or preliminary motions. This testifies to the\r\nefforts made by the judges, with the assistance of the legal\r\nofficers of the Chambers and the support of the judicial\r\nRegistry in general.\r\nThat having been said, I should like now to broach\r\nthe two crucial questions that I referred to earlier —\r\nnamely, the place of imprisonment and the security of the\r\nTribunal and all who work there, including the judges.\r\nThe reason I wish to discuss with you the problem\r\nof the place of imprisonment is because two persons have\r\nalready been sentenced by the Tribunal to terms of\r\nimprisonment, and if the Appeals Chamber upholds the\r\nsentences, the problem of knowing in which country the\r\nterms will be served is acute. Article 26 of the Statute\r\nstates:\r\n“Imprisonment shall be served in Rwanda or\r\nany of the States on a list of States which have\r\nindicated to the Security Council their willingness to\r\naccept convicted persons, as designated by the\r\nInternational Tribunal for Rwanda. Such\r\nimprisonment shall be in accordance with the\r\napplicable law of the State concerned, subject to the\r\nsupervision of the International Tribunal for\r\nRwanda.”\r\nThis means that the Tribunal needs the cooperation\r\nof States, which is all the more urgent in this area\r\nbecause, as I told you last year when I presented the\r\nsecond annual report, to date only six States, as well as\r\nRwanda, have informed the Security Council of their\r\nintention to receive, sometimes under certain conditions,\r\nconvicted persons in their national prisons. Those States\r\nare: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and\r\nSwitzerland. I wish to thank those States most particularly\r\nand to say how honoured we are by their support.\r\nDespite our efforts, those of the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General and of the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, so far no African country\r\nhas declared its readiness to receive the persons convicted\r\nby the Tribunal. Now, you will understand that for\r\nvarious reasons, pertaining as much to cultural factors as\r\nto their families’ proximity, it might be desirable that\r\ncertain convicted persons at least serve their sentences in\r\nAfrican prisons.\r\nWe believe that the reticence of many African States\r\nis due to the financial difficulties involved, as the\r\nconvicted persons must serve their sentences in facilities\r\nmeeting international standards. Hence, I am appealing to\r\nyou to transmit to the Governments you represent our\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nrequest for cooperation, in order that they might consider\r\nreceiving convicted persons in their prisons and that\r\nconsideration be given to the possibilities of cooperation in\r\nthe financing of such operations.\r\nThe other particularly pressing problem on which I\r\nwish to comment is that of security. Security means first of\r\nall the security of witnesses who agree to testify before us\r\nin Arusha, often at risk of their lives. In this connection, it\r\nis necessary that witness protection services be strengthened\r\nand, above all, that they have at their disposal the best\r\nguarantees of security. The pertinence of the question as to\r\nwhat guarantee of security can be given in Arusha is\r\ngreater than ever. We are not questioning the support given\r\nby Tanzania, which hosts the Tribunal and does its utmost\r\nto ensure the best possible working conditions. In this\r\nregard, I have already had the opportunity to express our\r\ngratitude personally to the President of the United Republic\r\nof Tanzania, Mr. Benjamin Mkapa, who has always assured\r\nus of his support.\r\nHowever, the two sentences handed down recently\r\ngive new acuity to the urgent security issue. The judges and\r\nthe Registrar are in contact with the host country authorities\r\nto try to strengthen security at the Tribunal in view of the\r\nnew situation.\r\nWith these few words, I have desired to draw your\r\nattention to the substantial progress achieved by the\r\nTribunal, but also to some of the difficulties encountered,\r\nincluding security, which I feel are sufficiently serious for\r\nappropriate solutions to be found as rapidly as possible.\r\nIn concluding, allow me, on behalf of the six Trial\r\nChamber judges, to express to you our sincere gratitude for\r\nthe honour of having been elected in May 1995 to our\r\npositions as judges of the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor Rwanda. As we approach the end of our term of office,\r\non behalf of us all, Honourable Judges Lennart Aspegren of\r\nSweden, Tafazzal Hossein Khan of Bangladesh, Yacov\r\nOstrovsky of the Russian Federation, Navanethem Pillay of\r\nSouth Africa, William Hussein Sekule of Tanzania and\r\nmyself, I must tell you that the mission you assigned to us\r\nwas a challenge every day of the four years of our term of\r\noffice. Fully aware of the importance of this mission, we\r\nhave endeavoured to establish a concept of international\r\ncriminal justice that meets the expectations of the victims\r\nof the severest of crimes — genocide and crimes against\r\nhumanity — while also satisfying the requirement for\r\nscrupulous respect for equitable justice.\r\nWe know that the accomplishment to which we have\r\ncontributed is far from perfect. The concept of\r\ninternational criminal justice which has been given\r\nexpression in Arusha and in The Hague, opening the way\r\nfor the Rome Conference, is the work of pioneers. As\r\nsuch, it is essential that it receive the political support it\r\nneeds in order to flourish.\r\nHistory will probably remember the twentieth\r\ncentury not only because it saw the most barbaric acts,\r\nbut also because it witnessed the affirmation of the\r\nfundamental principles of human rights and of\r\ninternational humanitarian law. Through our combined\r\nefforts, the twenty-first century could well be that of the\r\neffective implementation of these principles through the\r\nsystematic penal repression of any violations thereof.\r\nMr. Mtango (United Republic of Tanzania): Please\r\nallow me at the outset to acknowledge with great\r\nappreciation the excellent introduction of the third report\r\nof the Tribunal for Rwanda that Judge Laïty Kama, the\r\nPresident of the Tribunal, has just made to this Assembly.\r\nAs the country privileged to host the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda, my delegation welcomes\r\nwith particular pleasure the third annual report of the\r\nTribunal for Rwanda, contained in document A/53/429.\r\nWe are especially delighted to note that many of the\r\nserious difficulties which earlier worked to constrain the\r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the Tribunal are\r\nincreasingly being eliminated.\r\nIt is not possible to commend all those who, in one\r\nway or another, have made positive contributions to the\r\nfulfilment of the mandate of the Tribunal. These include\r\nGovernments, international organizations, civil society and\r\nindividuals. Special mention, however, needs to be made\r\nof the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, whose personal interest in the success of the\r\nTribunal has been critical; the President and the judges of\r\nthe Tribunal; the Prosecutor; the Registrar; and their staff,\r\nwhose unity of purpose and commitment to the task at\r\nhand have truly made a difference.\r\nThe current report is also a source of special\r\nencouragement, containing as it does the report on the\r\nfirst judgement ever handed down by an international\r\ntribunal on the crime of genocide. We are also impressed\r\nby the fact that, since the report was issued, there has\r\nbeen yet a second judgement in that regard.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nThese judgements by the Tribunal are undoubtedly of\r\nhistorical significance. They are a pivotal landmark in the\r\nhistory of international criminal law, as they underscore our\r\ncommon resolve to ensure that genocide and crimes against\r\nhumanity will not go unpunished. The reach of their\r\nsignificance is also of particular importance to the people,\r\nnot only of Rwanda, but of the Great Lakes region as a\r\nwhole and, indeed, elsewhere where conflicts have\r\nhorrifically eroded the value placed on human life.\r\nIt is in this regard that we must commend the\r\nprosecutions, which, in our view, were not only fair to the\r\ndefendants, but also called for vigorous sentences clearly\r\nmeant to put an end to impunity and thereby to promote\r\nnational reconciliation and the restoration of peace in\r\nRwanda. Indeed, we owe it to the people of Rwanda not to\r\nfail in the delivery of justice as we failed in preventing the\r\ngenocide and carnage which took place in 1994.\r\nSince it is clear that the workload of the Tribunal has\r\nbeen heavy, it is appropriate that we should welcome the\r\ndecision to establish a third Trial Chamber. We believe that\r\nthis will lighten the existing burden and expedite the\r\nprocess. Indeed, the increasing number of detainees whom\r\nthe Tribunal is now holding is welcome proof of the\r\ngrowing support of Governments, which have responded to\r\nthe Tribunal’s request for the surrender of suspects. As we\r\nwelcome this development and commend those who have\r\nfacilitated such cooperation with the Tribunal, we must\r\ncontinue to appeal for increased support in surrendering to\r\nthe Tribunal the suspects it seeks.\r\nMy delegation is under no illusion about the\r\nchallenges facing the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda. The report on agenda item 50 correctly notes that\r\nthere remain some difficulties requiring solution. Even with\r\nwidespread moral support for the Tribunal, much will\r\ndepend on the practical assistance we, as members of the\r\ninternational community, extend to the court.\r\nThe basic outlines are clear. The Chambers remain\r\nwithout sufficient technical resources, despite their heavy\r\nworkload. The Office of the Prosecutor continues to require\r\nthe cooperation of the international community, while the\r\nRegistry also continues to face resource constraints\r\nundermining its ability to optimize its administrative service\r\nto the Chambers and the Procuracy. These need to be\r\naddressed as a matter of priority.\r\nAs the Tribunal continues to face these challenges,\r\nwhich require the support of this Organization and, indeed,\r\nof the international community, we note with\r\nencouragement that the new Registrar has improved the\r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the Tribunal’s operations\r\nand that the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the\r\nUnited Nations was able to conclude in its follow-up\r\nreport that substantial improvements have taken place in\r\nalmost all sectors of the Tribunal’s operations.\r\nAdmittedly, the Tribunal in Arusha has been\r\nworking in challenging circumstances, some of which we\r\nhave just heard about from its President. It has, however,\r\nmade commendable progress. Regrettably, what has\r\nattracted more attention — particularly of the media —\r\nhas been the difficulties it has had to confront, rather than\r\nwhat it has achieved. It is our hope that the recent\r\nsuccesses will be a turning point in this regard. The\r\nGovernment of Tanzania remains strongly committed in\r\nits support of the Tribunal and we shall continue, in\r\npartnership with its leadership, to strive to ensure that all\r\nthe necessary facilities conducive to its smooth\r\nfunctioning are placed at its disposal. My Government\r\nreiterates its pledge to cooperate and stands willing to\r\ndiscuss and resolve any difficulties facing the Tribunal.\r\nWe were gratified by the visit paid to the Tribunal\r\nby the Secretary-General earlier this year. In welcoming\r\nhim to our country, we reiterated our firm belief that, just\r\nas we have to play our part, the international community\r\nmust also lend its support to the Tribunal in order to\r\nenable it to discharge its mandate and assist, as it should,\r\nin the healing process in Rwanda. We continue to make\r\nthe same appeal to this Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to point out that in spite of the\r\nrecent proud achievements of the Tribunal, further\r\nprogress may be slowed unless we all demonstrate our\r\nfirm support by availing the court of the resources it\r\nneeds, transmitting to it the information it seeks and\r\ndelivering the people it indicts. Above all, this challenge\r\nis ours. We must resolve not to let the court down.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French):\r\nJudge Laïty Kama, President of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda, presented to us with great\r\ncompetence and analytical clarity the third annual report\r\nof the Tribunal charged with the task of trying persons\r\naccused of genocide and other serious violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law committed in the territory\r\nof Rwanda or in the territory of neighbouring States\r\nbetween 1 January and 31 December 1994.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nThe mandate of the Tribunal, the scope of which\r\nmakes it an agenda in itself, seems at first sight to consist\r\nof a series of challenges that are difficult to tackle.\r\nIn 1994 the international community, badly shaken by\r\nthe atrocities and horrors of the tragedy in Rwanda,\r\nexpressed global censure, a sense of distress and the will to\r\ndo everything possible in the future to prevent such\r\nreprehensible and barbaric acts and to put an end to the\r\nreign of impunity. The members of the Tribunal for\r\nRwanda, like their colleagues from the Tribunal for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, can be considered true pioneers in the\r\ncomplex, delicate and sensitive field of respect for law and\r\nhuman dignity and the exercise of justice and equity in the\r\ncontext of international law.\r\nThe report under consideration today bears witness to\r\nthe fact that, despite working conditions that are often\r\ndifficult, the members of the Tribunal for Rwanda have\r\nbeen able, with courage and devotion, to apply international\r\njustice effectively and credibly.\r\nSince its establishment, the Tribunal has confirmed\r\nindictments against 43 people, 31 of whom were\r\napprehended and held in a detention facility in Arusha. The\r\nguilty plea of one of the most renowned of the detainees,\r\nMr. Jean Kambanda, transitional Prime Minister during the\r\ntime of the Rwandan tragedy, enabled the Tribunal and the\r\ninternational community to achieve a major breakthrough in\r\nthe establishment of a reliable international judicial system\r\nthat rejects the inevitability of impunity for acts of genocide\r\nor other serious violations of human rights.\r\nThat admission of guilt, as well as the trial that\r\nfollowed, have assumed historic significance, because they\r\nconferred upon the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda a very enviable position as the first international\r\nlegal body to deal specifically with matters relating to the\r\ncrime of genocide.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThat achievement was made possible by international\r\ncooperation and, in particular, by the unswerving\r\ncommitment and exemplary support of the African\r\ncountries in the genuinely difficult but inspiring discharge\r\nof the mandate entrusted to the Tribunal.\r\nThe Security Council and the Secretariat of the United\r\nNations have each made a significant contribution to the\r\nattainment of that objective. It is hardly necessary to repeat\r\nthat the judges of the Tribunal, working in often difficult\r\nconditions, have, with great courage, determination and\r\ndedication, accomplished a truly impressive task that has\r\nbeen hailed by the entire international community.\r\nAs we are about to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in a year\r\nthat has witnessed the creation of the International\r\nCriminal Court, we must all recognize that the Tribunal\r\nfor Rwanda has carried out useful jurisprudential work\r\nthat, above all, will make it possible to put an end to the\r\nculture of impunity.\r\nDespite these encouraging achievements, we must\r\nbear in mind that the impressive work of the Tribunal is\r\nfar from finished. Many challenges remain, and the\r\ninternational community must work together with the\r\nTribunal to meet them.\r\nMy country believes that the excellent work that has\r\nbeen accomplished deserves to be continued and\r\nsupported. The international community is therefore called\r\nupon to act. More than ever, it must continue to support\r\nand effectively contribute to the operation of the Tribunal\r\nand the noble mission of the judges, who are successfully,\r\nskilfully and very courageously discharging their mandate.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Norway welcomes the first\r\never judgements on the crime of genocide by an\r\ninternational court, 50 years after the adoption of the\r\ngenocide Convention. It fell to the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda to deliver those ground-breaking\r\ndecisions in September this year. Those precedent-setting\r\ncases provide the legal confirmation that genocide\r\nactually occurred in Rwanda in 1994, and they shed\r\nextensive light on the chain of events linked thereto.\r\nMoreover, they represent important new building blocks\r\nin international jurisprudence with regard to the\r\nprosecution of the most serious international crimes. The\r\nexperience obtained by the Rwanda Tribunal is also a\r\nstepping stone towards the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, in accordance with the\r\nRome Statute adopted in July this year. After a difficult\r\nstart, the Rwanda Tribunal is now up and running and we,\r\nlike so many others, hope that its activity will contribute\r\nto the long-term process of national reconciliation in\r\nRwanda.\r\nWe have previously expressed concern about the\r\nadministrative difficulties with which the Tribunal has\r\nbeen confronted, and we have followed with great\r\nattention efforts to improve working conditions in Arusha\r\nand Kigali. After a careful reading of the report before us,\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nand on the basis of the study made by the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services, we recognize that significant progress\r\nhas been made. Even though improvements still need to be\r\nmade, we feel encouraged by the steps that have already\r\nbeen taken and the results so far achieved.\r\nAmong the noteworthy improvements made, we note\r\nthe measures taken this summer in order to speed up cases\r\nbefore the Tribunal. We are confident that these steps will\r\ncontribute to an effective handling of cases without\r\nreducing in any way the procedural rights of the accused or\r\nof any other parties to the process.\r\nNorway remains a strong supporter of the Tribunal\r\nand joins those that have appealed to States to take all\r\nlegislative steps necessary in order to ensure effective State\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal. In addition to legislation and\r\ncompliance with the Tribunal’s requests for assistance,\r\nconcrete support for the Tribunal should be shown through\r\nfinancial and material support. The Norwegian Government\r\nhas, among its measures, declared its willingness to\r\nconsider applications from the Tribunal concerning the\r\nenforcement of sentences from the Tribunal and,\r\nsubsequently, in conformity with our national law, receive\r\na limited number of convicted persons to serve their terms\r\nin Norway.\r\nMr. Zmeevski (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The Russian Federation is grateful to the\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal for Rwanda for the\r\nreport on the work of that body of international criminal\r\njustice for 1997-1998.\r\nThe Russian Federation attaches great importance to\r\nthe work of the Rwanda Tribunal. It is our belief that the\r\nwork of the Tribunal is a solid factor in the restoration and\r\nmaintenance of peace and calm in Rwanda and the\r\nadjoining region. The Tribunal’s judgements in the cases\r\nagainst Kambanda and Akayesu not only elicited a\r\nwidespread political reaction, but were also an important\r\nfactor in developing international criminal law. The\r\nTribunal’s decision finding Jean-Paul Akayesu guilty of\r\ngenocide was the first international verdict on this crime in\r\nthe history of the world.\r\nRussia has supported the work of the United Nations\r\nto overcome the organizational, financial and staffing\r\ndifficulties encountered by the International Tribunal for\r\nRwanda. In the Security Council and in the General\r\nAssembly we clearly expressed our positive reaction to the\r\nproposals to enhance the effectiveness of the work of the\r\nTribunal, inter alia, through establishing a third Trial\r\nChamber.\r\nA few days from now we will be electing to the\r\nTribunal a new, larger group of judges, in accordance\r\nwith Security Council resolution 1165 (1998), and they\r\nwill be called upon immediately to start presiding over\r\ntrials against a large number of accused who are now\r\nawaiting trial. We believe that with the establishment of\r\nthe third Trial Chamber, the international community will\r\nbe entitled to expect the Tribunal to work faster, thus\r\nevening the imbalance in the level of activity between the\r\nRwanda and the Yugoslavia Tribunals. This approach will\r\nhelp avoid any impression of double standards in\r\napproaches to situations of flagrant and mass violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nAs can be seen from the report, during its four years\r\nof existence the Tribunal has handed down only two\r\njudgements. The trials of three indictees begun early last\r\nyear are not yet completed, and the trials of some other\r\nindictees have not even started yet. At this stage there are\r\nindictments against more than 40 people, and about 30\r\npeople have actually been arrested and are being detained\r\nin Arusha awaiting trial — indeed, some have been\r\nawaiting trial for about three years. Trials have started for\r\nonly five accused persons, and, as can be seen from the\r\nreport, each trial tends to last about one and half to two\r\nyears. If the Tribunal’s pace of work continues\r\nunchanged, it is difficult to see how over the next 8 to 10\r\nyears it will be possible to complete the trials of the more\r\nthan 30 indictees when the number of those being accused\r\nand indicted is constantly increasing.\r\nThe Security Council’s decision to increase the\r\nnumber of judges and to create a third Trial Chamber\r\ndoes not mean that this situation will automatically\r\nimprove. The new Trial Chamber will be able to start\r\nworking only when another room for hearings has been\r\nbuilt, so that the Prosecutor will be able to begin another\r\ntrial in that Trial Chamber. It is difficult to see from the\r\nreport of the Tribunal, unfortunately, what the situation is\r\nregarding the provision of conditions to ensure that the\r\nthird Trial Chamber will be able to start functioning as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nThe Tribunal’s report refers to the fact that during\r\ntrials, for one reason or another, there are often breaks, or\r\ncases are adjourned, and the Trial Chambers are left idle.\r\nHowever, there are no specific comments in the report\r\nabout what measures could be taken to avoid that\r\nsituation or how to fill the gaps in the Court’s schedule.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nIt would seem to us that the time could be used to begin\r\nand carry on other trials, but it is simply not clear from the\r\nreport why the decisions taken by the judges in this matter\r\nhave not been implemented.\r\nThere are a number of ways in which the effectiveness\r\nof the Tribunal’s work could be improved. It seems to us\r\nthat to ensure the effective work of the International\r\nCriminal Court, the procedures and working methods of its\r\nvarious structures must be improved and the shortage of\r\nadministrative and technical staff must be redressed. The\r\nconstruction of the premises for the Tribunal have also to\r\nbe arranged. We believe that if these measures are carried\r\nout, it will help the Tribunal quickly and fully to discharge\r\nthe mandate entrusted to it.\r\nMr. Mangoaela (Lesotho): The world continues to\r\nwitness unprecedented developments in the protection of the\r\nbasic norms of humanitarian law and human rights. The ad\r\nhoc Tribunals have shown not only that an international\r\ncriminal system is possible, but that it can be effective. By\r\noffering justice as an alternative to retribution, the Tribunals\r\nbroke the cycle of violence and contributed to the process\r\nof reconciliation. Ultimately, the Tribunals will give way to\r\na permanent court with authority to punish atrocities\r\nwhenever, wherever and by whomever they are committed.\r\nThe importance of these Tribunals as precedents for a\r\npermanent criminal court can thus not be underestimated.\r\nIt is therefore essential that we ensure their success. More\r\nimportantly, a historic step towards making the rule of law\r\nand the protection of human rights truly universal was taken\r\nas recently as July 1998, when the Rome Statute was\r\nadopted by an overwhelming majority of States\r\nparticipating in the Rome Conference. The adoption of the\r\nStatute has given renewed hope to the struggle for human\r\nrights and the fight against impunity.\r\nBefore commenting on the report before us, let me\r\nbegin by thanking Judge Laïty Kama, President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, for his clear\r\nand concise introduction of the third report of the Tribunal\r\nas contained in document A/53/429. We commend Judge\r\nKama for his leadership of the Tribunal since 1994. We\r\nalso commend all the other judges and the staff of the\r\nRwanda Tribunal for their hard work.\r\nOverall, the report highlights a number of significant\r\ndevelopments that have taken place since the last report.\r\nWe are happy to note that the Tribunal has safely navigated\r\nthe rough shores and is now well on its way into the calm\r\nwaters of the high seas. As the report indicates, 43\r\nindividuals have been formally indicted, 31 of whom have\r\nbeen apprehended and are awaiting trial. We urge States\r\nto cooperate with the Tribunal in apprehending the\r\nremaining suspects wherever they may be. It is\r\nparticularly noteworthy that the Tribunal has handed\r\ndown its first judgement and has recorded its first guilty\r\nplea. These developments demonstrate the hard work and\r\ndedication of the Tribunal’s workforce. The guilty plea by\r\nformer Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, the most senior\r\nofficial of the Interim Government during the height of\r\nthe atrocities of 1994, vindicates the international\r\ncommunity’s long-held conviction not only that genocide\r\nwas committed in Rwanda, but that it was planned at the\r\nhighest level. The guilty plea sends a clear message to all\r\nthose who participated in the mass murder of innocent\r\npeople in Rwanda that their days are numbered.\r\nWe welcome the various measures taken to improve\r\nthe administration and logistical support provided to the\r\nChambers and the Prosecutor in the discharge of their\r\nfunctions. Among the improvements undertaken since the\r\nlast report are extensions to the library, the upgrading of\r\nthe satellite communications system, the building of the\r\nsecond courtroom and the systematic implementation of\r\nthe recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight\r\nServices, all of which are welcome developments which\r\nwill further enhance the Tribunal’s work.\r\nWe are all too familiar with the phrase “justice\r\ndelayed is justice denied”. Any unjustified delays in\r\nadministering justice will have a negative impact on\r\npeople’s perception of the Tribunal. It is for this reason\r\nthat we welcome the creation of the third Trial Chamber,\r\nwhich we trust will enable the Tribunal to carry out its\r\nfunctions more effectively and ensure that justice is\r\nspeedily rendered to the victims and the survivors of the\r\nRwanda tragedy. While we note that most delays are\r\nattributable to factors relating to the normal administration\r\nof criminal justice, we urge the Tribunal to continue with\r\nits innovative measures aimed at expediting proceedings.\r\nThe vitality of the Tribunal depends upon the\r\ncooperation of States in apprehending and transferring\r\nsuspects, in permitting on-site visits and interviews with\r\nwitnesses, and in securing documents. We commend all\r\ncountries that have accorded full cooperation and\r\nassistance to the Tribunal. As the Nairobi-Kigali operation\r\nhas clearly demonstrated, cooperation with and assistance\r\nto the Tribunal can bear fruitful results in bringing to\r\njustice those involved in genocide in Rwanda. In\r\nparticular, we commend the valuable assistance extended\r\nto the Tribunal by the Governments of Rwanda, the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, Kenya, Senegal, Côte\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nd’Ivoire, the Central African Republic, Belgium, Cameroon\r\nand the Netherlands. The international community also\r\nbears the responsibility of sharing the burden of enforcing\r\nthe Tribunal’s sentences by accepting prisoners. We trust\r\nthat more States will shortly express a willingness to accept\r\nconvicted prisoners.\r\nFinally, since inadequacy of resources cause delays in\r\nthe Tribunal’s administration of justice, we express our\r\nhope that the Tribunal will continue to receive stable and\r\nadequate financial, human and technical resources to ensure\r\nits effective functioning.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria) (interpretation from French):\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. The Central and Eastern European countries\r\nassociated with the European Union — Bulgaria, the Czech\r\nRepublic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia — the associated country Cyprus, and\r\nthe European Free Trade Association country member of\r\nthe European Economic Area the Principality of\r\nLiechtenstein align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union wishes first of all to thank the\r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda, Judge Laïty Kama, for his introduction of the\r\nannual report of the Tribunal covering the period 1 July\r\n1997 to 30 June 1998. We congratulate the President, the\r\nProsecutor and the Registrar of the Court for their work\r\nover the past year. The European Union conveys its\r\nappreciation also to the host countries — the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, Rwanda and the Netherlands — for\r\ntheir continued support for the organs of the Tribunal.\r\nAs this is the third annual report of the Tribunal to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, it would seem useful to give a brief\r\nhistorical overview. By its resolution 955 (1994) of 8\r\nNovember 1994, the Security Council established the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of\r\nPersons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in\r\nthe Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible\r\nfor Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the\r\nTerritory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31\r\nDecember 1994. In its resolution 978 (1995) of 27 February\r\n1995, the Council urged States to arrest and detain persons\r\nfound within their territory against whom there was\r\nsufficient evidence that they were responsible for acts of\r\nviolence within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\r\nThose two resolutions, adopted under Chapter VII of\r\nthe Charter, are in themselves a reminder of the importance\r\nof the mandate that the international community has given\r\nthe Tribunal. It is not simply a question of putting an end\r\nto impunity and ensuring that justice triumphs in respect\r\nof events of enormous gravity; it is a question also of\r\npreventing any recurrence of such events by ensuring, in\r\na manner visible to all, justice that is rigorous and that\r\nstrictly respects internationally recognized principles of\r\ncriminal law. For justice to be done in this manner, the\r\nTribunal must be able to function effectively. It is\r\nimportant also to stress the Tribunal’s role in the process\r\nof national reconciliation.\r\nThe European Union is encouraged that a number of\r\nmeasures are under way to improve the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the Tribunal’s operation, pursuant to the\r\nfirst report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services of\r\nthe Secretariat. We want to recall the importance that we\r\nattach to the recommendations of the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services. Nonetheless, we are disturbed by\r\nproblems in the area of administration that were\r\nmentioned in the second report of the Tribunal and that\r\nstill persist. But thanks to the vigorous efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General and the office of the President of the\r\nTribunal, the Tribunal now seems to be in a position\r\nbetter to discharge the duties defined in its mandate.\r\nThe report lists a number of the measures that have\r\nbeen taken, of which I will touch on just a few. The\r\nTribunal’s Registry, which is responsible for managing all\r\nmatters relating to human resources, was able in 1997 to\r\nhire 210 new staff members and renew the contracts of\r\n189 others. Further recruitment is envisaged for the\r\ncurrent year within the context of the budget authorized\r\nby the General Assembly, which, compared to the\r\nprevious year’s budget, provides for a significant and\r\nmuch needed increase in the number of posts.\r\nWith respect to the recruitment policy, where we\r\nbelieve some problems still exist, we would stress the\r\nimportance of finding highly qualified personnel and of\r\nensuring that the additional means made available to the\r\nTribunal are used primarily to improve the conditions for\r\nthe judicial work of the judges and prosecutors.\r\nWe also take note of the decision taken by the\r\nSecurity Council on 30 April 1998 to create a third Trial\r\nChamber. Let me recall that the General Assembly will\r\nsoon be electing the judges of the three Trial Chambers.\r\nI am pleased to note that the Tribunal continues to\r\nreceive voluntary contributions in cash and kind,\r\nincluding audio-visual materials, inter alia, from member\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nStates of the European Union. Moreover, some members of\r\nour Union have seconded staff to the Tribunal until 28\r\nFebruary 1999, the date on which the Secretary-General,\r\npursuant to the relevant General Assembly resolutions, will\r\nbe obliged to terminate the services of that category of\r\nstaff. The Tribunal’s library, an essential working tool, has\r\nbeen considerably expanded, and working conditions for\r\nlibrary users improved. This is due in part at least to\r\ndonations by several Governments, non-governmental\r\norganizations and national associations.\r\nThe judicial activities of the Tribunal, described in\r\ndetail in the report, show that the Tribunal is now\r\noperating, in its own words, “at cruising speed”. The\r\nEuropean Union would like to stress once again that in\r\norder to carry out its work in an impartial manner, the\r\nTribunal must continue to work totally independently from\r\nany and all political authorities. For that reason, the\r\nEuropean Union, which continues to provide significant\r\nlegal and logistical cooperation to the Tribunal, will refrain\r\nfrom commenting on the cases being considered in that\r\nforum. However, we would note that the first judgement\r\never handed down by an international court on the crime of\r\ngenocide was that rendered by the Tribunal less than two\r\nmonths ago. Moreover, this year the Tribunal recorded the\r\nfirst guilty plea by an accused.\r\nThese events led the Secretary-General to state:\r\n“The success achieved by this Court in suppressing\r\ngenocide is of historic scope and demonstrates the\r\nUnited Nations capacity to create institutions which\r\nrespond to the highest aspirations of the human race.”\r\nIndeed, it is thanks to the Tribunal that 50 years after\r\nits adoption in the wake of the Holocaust, the Convention\r\non the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of\r\nGenocide has now become a concrete manifestation of the\r\nresolve of the international community to combat genocide\r\nas never before.\r\nBecause of some difficulties still persisting in the area\r\nof judicial assistance, the European Union would stress\r\nonce again the need for all parties and all States fully to\r\ncooperate with the Tribunal so that it can effectively\r\ndischarge its mandate. From this standpoint and without\r\nprejudging the merits of the cases, the European Union\r\nwould note that a number of persons, including some who\r\nhad occupied positions of authority in 1994, have been\r\narrested in third countries following the issuance of arrest\r\nwarrants by the Tribunal. The European Union sincerely\r\nhopes that these developments will continue and that the\r\nnecessary administrative measures will be taken by the\r\nStates concerned to enable the witnesses summoned by\r\nthe Tribunal to travel there in order to appear before it.\r\nWe trust also that the Tribunal will be able to speed up\r\nits judicial work, particularly in the case of long-time\r\ndetainees.\r\nIn conclusion, the European Union would note that\r\nwhile there has been substantial progress, much remains\r\nto be done. Arrests have been made, but the people for\r\nwhom arrest warrants have been issued are still at large;\r\nthey must be detained. Moreover, the Tribunal must\r\ncontinue to provide information about its work in order to\r\nheighten public awareness — primarily in Rwanda but\r\nalso in Member States as a whole, including the donor\r\ncountries — of the importance of the mandate entrusted\r\nto the Tribunal, which is a reflection of the international\r\ncommunity’s condemnation of genocide and other grave\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law.\r\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda set\r\nan important precedent with respect to the establishment\r\nof the International Criminal Court, whose Statute was\r\nadopted in Rome in July 1998, thereby opening up a new\r\nchapter in the process of bringing to justice the\r\nperpetrators of international crimes. The practical\r\nexperience of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda will be a valuable resource in elaborating norms\r\nfor the prosecution and punishment, at the international\r\nlevel, of grave violations of humanitarian law, regardless\r\nof where they are committed or by whom.\r\nAwareness has also been heightened of the\r\nimportance of giving victims access to the Tribunal and\r\nprotecting them. The European Union would reiterate that\r\nthe international community must continue fully to\r\ncooperate with the Tribunal and provide it the necessary\r\nresources to discharge its mandate fully. We would urge\r\nthe Tribunal to continue tirelessly its efforts to bring to\r\njustice those who have participated in the commission of\r\nhorrible crimes so that justice is not denied the victims\r\nand in order for a process of true national reconciliation\r\nto begin in Rwanda.\r\nMr. Díaz (Costa Rica) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThere cannot be peace without justice; there cannot be\r\nreconciliation until the truth comes to light; and a free\r\nand democratic society cannot be built as long as\r\ncriminals who have perpetrated the most hideous\r\natrocities remain unpunished. Impunity poses a threat to\r\npeace because it incites the victims to vengeance and\r\nincreases the arrogance of the perpetrators. In this context,\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nmy delegation believes that the existence of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is a prerequisite\r\nfor the much needed reconciliation in the Great Lakes\r\nregion.\r\nWe are deeply gratified that the difficulties that had\r\narisen with respect to the work of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda are being resolved. The Tribunal\r\nfinally is trying cases on a continual basis. Its rulings, as\r\nwell as its 150-plus decisions, represent significant steps in\r\nthe development of international humanitarian law and\r\ninternational human rights law. Its jurisprudence has\r\nbecome authoritative in the interpretation of international\r\ncommon law and an impetus to the continued elaboration\r\nof that law in areas in which gaps or imprecisions still\r\nexist. We would note also that its very existence helped\r\npromote the adoption of the Rome Statute for the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court.\r\nMy delegation is concerned at the continuing\r\ndifficulties with respect to the elaboration of a judicial\r\ntimetable to ensure the early trial of all the defendants. The\r\nInternational Tribunal and the international community that\r\nestablished it must respect the defendants’ fundamental\r\nright to a speedy trial. It was for this reason that my\r\ndelegation, in its capacity as a Security Council member,\r\nsupported the establishment of a third Trial Chamber, so\r\nthat all the detained or indicted who are in the hands of the\r\nTribunal can be judged promptly. We hope that the election\r\nof these judges in the near future and their assuming their\r\nfunctions will accelerate the judicial activities of the\r\nTribunal.\r\nAlong these same lines we are gratified by the\r\nTribunal’s efforts to improve its effectiveness — including\r\nthe rule modifications adopted in July of this year — in\r\norder to eliminate the causes of these unjustified delays. We\r\nbelieve that the Tribunal must continue these efforts in\r\norder to bring about additional improvements as regards\r\nprocedural matters and its working methods as well as\r\ncoordination with the Office of the Prosecutor.\r\nWe are pleased by the improvements in the logistic\r\nand administrative support for the Tribunal. We believe that\r\nthis organ cannot be truly effective if it cannot rely on the\r\nnecessary financial and human resources. This is an area in\r\nwhich we must all make greater efforts. The financial\r\nauthorities of the United Nations and our own delegations\r\nwill have to make greater efforts to secure for this Tribunal\r\nall the necessary resources.\r\nMy delegation cannot fail to avail itself of this\r\nopportunity to mention our concern about the situation of\r\ndetainees and indictees held in Rwanda. We consider that\r\nRwanda itself must bring to trial all the alleged\r\nperpetrators of criminal acts committed in 1994 who are\r\nnot being prosecuted by the International Tribunal. The\r\nexistence of this Tribunal does not absolve the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda from its primary obligation to\r\nadminister justice and penalize the guilty. Nevertheless,\r\nwe are seriously concerned by the tremendous number of\r\ndetainees in the prisons of that country and the terrible\r\nconditions in which they are being held. We believe that\r\ngreater efforts must be made to ensure that these\r\nprisoners are treated with dignity, as well as to strictly\r\nrespect their legal rights to be brought to trial.\r\nSimilarly, we are concerned about the execution by\r\nthe Rwandan authorities of several people convicted of\r\ncommitting acts of genocide and other violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law. Costa Rica is opposed, in\r\nall circumstances, to capital punishment. The\r\nadministration of justice must not violate the fundamental\r\nright to life of every human being. Therefore we urge\r\nthese authorities to impose sentences consonant with the\r\nhighest standards of respect for human rights.\r\nFinally, allow me to place on record our full support\r\nfor the work of the Tribunal and our recognition of the\r\nefforts of its President, Laïty Kama, and its members. Let\r\nme also thank the Secretary-General for preparing this\r\nthird annual report.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 50?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nAgenda item 24 (continued)\r\nImplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, including\r\nmeasures and recommendations agreed upon at its mid-\r\nterm review\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/390 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania): I\r\nwould like to associate my delegation with the statement\r\nmade by Indonesia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe support that statement whole-heartedly.\r\nIt is a privilege and great honour for me to address\r\nthis Assembly on the important item on our agenda today,\r\non the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s. For more than\r\na decade now, the development of Africa has preoccupied\r\nthis Assembly, since the 1986 adoption of the United\r\nNations Programme of Action for African Economic\r\nRecovery and Development 1986-1990 (UNPAAERD) at its\r\nthirteenth special session to the 1991 inauguration of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s (UN-NADAF) — the subject of our debate\r\ntoday. While such efforts have been expanded to address\r\nAfrica’s developmental problems, the circumstances that led\r\nto the adoption of UNPAAERD and its successor,\r\nUN-NADAF, including the need for additional resource\r\nmobilization, are as valid today as they were when the two\r\nprogrammes were established.\r\nDespite the enormous problems Africa continues to\r\nface today, the continent has the potential for growth and\r\ndevelopment. The statistics of the last three years have\r\namply demonstrated such growth. That is why the region\r\nhas embarked on an ambitious reform process aimed at\r\nharnessing that potential, taking cognizance of the fact that\r\nits development is, in the final analysis, the responsibility\r\nof Africans themselves. In this regard, Africa has taken the\r\nchallenge and committed itself to implementing fully all\r\npolicies and programmes aimed at creating an enabling\r\nenvironment for growth and development. In so doing,\r\nAfrican countries have managed to halt the deteriorating\r\neconomic trend and, in many cases, have even registered\r\nmodest growth. What is now required is a supportive\r\ninternational environment in terms of increased financial\r\nresources and other mechanisms that will sustain that\r\ngrowth.\r\nAfrica needs to develop. And indeed it has to\r\ndevelop, for the good of humankind and the world. That\r\nis why it has embarked on the current process of reform\r\nand restructuring. However, in order to sustain this\r\nprocess, Africa needs increased resource flows. This is\r\nthe only way that Africa can progress, and African\r\nprogress is beneficial not only to African people but also\r\nto the world at large. Given the interdependent nature of\r\nthe global economy today, progress in Africa will thus\r\nbenefit all, including those who have come to its\r\nassistance. This is a fact, and it is being recognized in the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s.\r\nThe development efforts being made by African\r\ncountries will be meaningful only if the international\r\ncommunity builds a spirit of new partnership with Africa,\r\ncomprehensively addressing its problems and searching\r\nfor lasting solutions. It is at this juncture that we welcome\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. It is hoped that the report will\r\nprovide additional impetus for the operationalization of\r\nUN-NADAF.\r\nAfrica is a continent of 53 States, and of the 48 least\r\ndeveloped countries in the world, 33 are in Africa. This\r\nmakes Africa the most backward continent in terms of\r\ndevelopment. Not surprisingly, therefore, Africa has\r\ndominated and continues to dominate the Security\r\nCouncil’s agenda pertaining to peace and security matters.\r\nThe development of Africa is also greatly hampered\r\nby the unprecedented level of its external debt, which\r\nkeeps growing each year. Statistics indicate that Africa’s\r\nexternal indebtedness increased from $300 billion in 1992\r\nto $332 billion in 1995, and it was $323 billion in 1996.\r\nWith such an unsustainable level of external debt, it is\r\ndifficult to have any meaningful capital transformation,\r\nwhich is a prerequisite for development. Africa therefore\r\nlooks forward to the creation of a meaningful mechanism\r\naimed at effectively addressing the debt problem.\r\nAdmittedly, the result of well-intended programmes,\r\nsuch as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative of the Bretton Woods institutions, has proven\r\ndisappointing because of the conditionalities and the\r\nsluggish pace of implementation. While Africa does not\r\ndesire to dishonour its debt obligations, a cancellation of\r\nsuch a debt burden would release and make available to\r\nAfrica the critical resources it needs to build appropriate\r\ninfrastructures for its development.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nIn the area of trade, many African countries still\r\ndepend on commodity trade as the major source of export\r\nearnings. However, their share of the global market has\r\nremained low and accounts for only two per cent of world\r\ntrade. It is sad to note, as the 1997 report of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\r\nsuggests, that the 33 least developed countries of Africa,\r\nwho have about 10 per cent of the world’s population,\r\nexport only 0.37 per cent of global exports and only 1.4 per\r\ncent of the developing countries’ exports. Worse still, the\r\nimpact on African countries of the implementation of the\r\nUruguay Round is still ambiguous, particularly in the areas\r\nrelated to market access and agriculture and in the erosion\r\nof preferential treatment for Africa’s commodity exports.\r\nAs Africa moves to implement the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) rules on commodities, it is necessary,\r\nhowever, to grant a moratorium and therefore safeguard the\r\npreferential treatment African countries had enjoyed\r\npreviously under the Lomé Convention. This would enable\r\nAfrica to adjust to economic diversification, which is\r\ndeemed necessary if it is to build its competitiveness on the\r\nworld market.\r\nIt is eight years now since the implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF began, but Africa has very little to show from\r\nthe programme’s existence. The declining importance of\r\nprimary commodities in world trade, coupled with loss of\r\nmarket share in world commodities, puts Africa in a\r\ncomparatively weak position to benefit from globalization.\r\nThe situation is aggravated further by declining resources,\r\nparticularly the official development assistance that is\r\nessential in development of both human capital and physical\r\ninfrastructure. To make matters worse, rules on technology\r\ntransfer deprive African countries of the opportunity to\r\nadopt more modern technologies for their development; in\r\nthe end, even their efforts towards industrialization are\r\nthwarted.\r\nConsequently, it is obvious that globalization has not\r\nassisted African countries to increase their exports, let alone\r\nimprove their incomes. The net result is accumulated debts,\r\nwhich are sustaining consumption rather than developmental\r\nneeds. The debt issue, therefore, needs to be seriously\r\naddressed.\r\nAfrican countries have taken painful measures to\r\nrestructure and to reform government laws and procedures\r\nin the hope that foreign direct investments would be\r\nforthcoming. However, such hopes have remained illusory\r\nas foreign direct investment flows have continued to bypass\r\nAfrica. Indeed, this trend has invalidated, at least for\r\nAfrica, the claim that increased foreign direct investment\r\nhas compensated for official development assistance\r\nshortfalls. Although foreign direct investment flows to\r\ndeveloping countries have been increasing, the opposite\r\nhas been the case with Africa, where even the little that\r\nhas been directed to the continent has been decreasing\r\nover the years.\r\nFor example, in 1995, the total net resource flows to\r\ndeveloping countries was $243.1 billion, while Africa’s\r\nshare was only $28.1 billion. As for 1996, the total net\r\nresource flows to developing countries was $281.6 billion,\r\nout of which only $22.2 billion went to Africa. These\r\nstatistics demonstrate clearly that Africa needs a new\r\ndevelopment strategy if the continent is to pull out of\r\nmisery and underdevelopment.\r\nBy and large, Africa lacks the resources needed to\r\nundertake all the necessary restructuring and to build an\r\ninfrastructure which can attract and support sustained\r\nflows of foreign direct investments. Even in rare cases\r\nwhere such infrastructure has been instituted, foreign\r\ndirect investments have not been forthcoming, at least at\r\nthe rate and levels which can impact positively and enable\r\nAfrica to make an economic turnaround. This is partly\r\ndue to the hesitancy of investors to venture into new and\r\nuntested markets, notwithstanding the statistical fact that\r\nthe level of returns on investments in Africa is one of the\r\nhighest. That hesitancy could be a result of deep-seated\r\nprejudices engendered by the propaganda that Africa is a\r\ncontinent in which instability and conflict are endemic. In\r\nsome cases, conflicts have plagued individual African\r\ncountries, but these are very few.\r\nWe therefore remain convinced that UN-NADAF\r\ndeserves the support of all. In this regard, we believe that\r\nAfrica’s development partners will continue supporting\r\nUN-NADAF and, in so doing, will be assisting African\r\ncountries to mobilize the resources needed to set up\r\ninvestment-sustaining infrastructure and also will be\r\ndeveloping an awareness that will help eliminate negative\r\nimages which block increased foreign direct investment\r\nflows to Africa.\r\nI wish to conclude by stating that Africa has had\r\nmany initiatives over the past decade, but to no avail. Is\r\nit not about time that we asked ourselves what went\r\nwrong? Both Africa and the international community have\r\nto provide answers to this question. It is not enough to\r\nshow empathy with the continent, although it is much\r\nneeded, but concrete programmes and action are what\r\nAfrica urgently needs.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana): The state of implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), particularly following\r\nits mid-term review, signals a far from satisfactory level of\r\ncommitment on the part of the international community to\r\nAfrica’s development.\r\nIn our view, General Assembly resolution 46/151 of\r\n18 December 1991 and subsequent resolutions on the\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF constitute a collective\r\ncompact between Africa and the international community.\r\nThat compact identifies the respective responsibilities of\r\nAfrican countries and those of the international community\r\nin addressing the development challenges in Africa in the\r\ncontext of our common interests.\r\nAs made clear by the progress report presented by the\r\nSecretary-General (A/53/390) in response to resolution\r\n51/132 of 6 December 1996, and by recent worldwide\r\nsurveys on economic and human development, the compact\r\nis currently like a three-legged table, a table with one leg\r\nmissing — an unstable construct.\r\nParagraphs 11 and 12 of the Secretary-General’s report\r\npaint a broad picture of the seriousness with which African\r\ncountries have pursued their task of achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment and integration into the world economy. The\r\nweaknesses identified by the report show that, where it is\r\nin their power, African countries have not shirked from any\r\nsacrifice or any commitment to shoulder their\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nIn the face of limited budgetary resources arising from\r\nthe need for prudence in government borrowing and the\r\nhigher expenditure demands created by measures to\r\nstrengthen capacity and by new institutions established\r\nunder constitutional rule, the potential of unaided domestic\r\naction has been distorted or severely compromised. These\r\nlimitations have highlighted the important role of foreign\r\ndirect investments, official development assistance, trade\r\nand debt sustainability in providing or creating\r\ncomplementary resources as the catalysts to growth or to\r\ngenerate momentum in the economies of African countries.\r\nTo that end, many African countries, including my\r\nown, have enacted legislation, created some of the most\r\nattractive environments for investments and courted\r\ninvestors, local and foreign. Private capital flows to Africa,\r\nhowever, continue to account for a very small percentage\r\nof total flows to developing countries, with the continent\r\nreceiving only 2.7 per cent of such flows in 1996. Even so,\r\nthese flows are concentrated in a few countries and in a\r\nfew sectors — mainly energy and mining — bypassing\r\nagriculture and manufacturing, where the potential for\r\nproduction linkages and value addition are greatest.\r\nAs regards official development assistance, the\r\nSecretary-General rightly recalls in paragraphs 94 to 97 of\r\nhis report A/53/390 that, to achieve the objectives of\r\nUN-NADAF, it was estimated that a minimum amount of\r\n$30 billion in net official development assistance would\r\nbe needed in 1992, after which it would have to increase\r\nat an average annual rate of 4 per cent to achieve a\r\ngrowth rate of at least 6 per cent per annum. This rate has\r\nsince been revised upwards to 8 per cent to 10 per cent,\r\nto be able significantly to reduce poverty in the continent,\r\nwhich means an even higher volume of official\r\ndevelopment assistance resources than originally\r\nestimated. And yet, total official development assistance\r\nflows to Africa have been declining steadily, from $25\r\nbillion in 1992 to $20.7 billion in 1996, according to the\r\nSecretary-General’s report A/53/390/Add.1.\r\nIt is difficult to understand why official development\r\nassistance levels should be declining to historical lows\r\nwhen some of the donor countries are enjoying surpluses.\r\nIt is tempting to conclude that lack of political will is at\r\nthe bottom of the issue, not lack of resources or\r\ncompetition for resources. Improvements in African\r\nexport production have also failed to lift the continent’s\r\nshare of world trade above 2 per cent, due primarily to\r\nproblems with market access. Africa is expected to be a\r\nloser from the results of the Uruguay Round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations — which, ironically, was\r\ngeared to the expansion of trade — because of the\r\ncontinent’s weak institutional frameworks for\r\nimplementation of the Round results, price uncertainties\r\nand higher interest rates affecting export financing.\r\nAfrica’s debt burden also remains a critical factor.\r\nAccording to the Secretary-General’s report A/52/871 to\r\nthe Security Council on Africa, to service that debt fully,\r\nAfrica is projected to spend this year as much as $33\r\nbillion, equivalent to 25 per cent of the continent’s total\r\nexport earnings.\r\nThe four areas I have outlined constitute the cross-\r\ncutting issues impeding the overall socio-economic\r\nprogress of Africa. By failing to address these vital\r\nmatters realistically, Africa’s development partners must\r\ntake some responsibility for the conditions which continue\r\nto affect the implementation of UN-NADAF.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nWe are happy to note, however, the commendable role\r\nbeing played by the organizations of the United Nations\r\nfamily and autonomous bodies brought into relationship\r\nwith the United Nations to assist African countries in\r\nimplementing programmes and projects to strengthen their\r\nsocio-economic capacity. We note particularly, with\r\nsatisfaction, the revision by the Committee for Programme\r\nand Coordination (CPC) this year of programme 6 of the\r\nUnited Nations medium-term plan, 1998-2001, entitled\r\n“Africa: New Agenda for Development”, in relation to the\r\nUnited Nations System-wide Special Initiative for the\r\nImplementation of UN-NADAF.\r\nWe believe that that linkage and the recommendations\r\nmade by the Secretary-General in his report on the causes\r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa provide the basis for a\r\nconcerted approach by the international community to\r\nAfrica’s development. It also provides an integrated\r\nframework for the review of UN-NADAF in the year 2002.\r\nThe Agenda for Action, adopted at the just-ended second\r\nTokyo International Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD II), solidifies this process of integration of the\r\nframework for action by all partners in Africa’s\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this connection, we call for an intensification of the\r\nefforts being made by the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF), the World Bank, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the International Fund for Agricultural\r\nDevelopment (IFAD), the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Programme\r\n(UNEP), the International Labour Organization (IL0) and\r\nthe Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), among others,\r\nin Africa, in the framework of the United Nations Special\r\nInitiative for Africa, to ensure harmonization and\r\neffectiveness. We believe that the focus of their activities\r\nshould increasingly aim at creating synergies for regional\r\nintegration. We also call on Africa’s development partners\r\nof the developed world to use the framework of these\r\ncommitments, to which they are parties, to build consensus\r\nin their respective domestic arena for Africa’s development.\r\nWe believe that the assistance which the development\r\npartners need to deploy to Africa’s cause is very meagre\r\ncompared to their endowment, the spillover from a buoyant\r\nAfrica and the moral imperative of saving millions from\r\npoverty, conflict and preventable death. In this connection\r\nwe propose a dialogue, within the framework of\r\nUN-NADAF, to address enhanced capital flows to Africa\r\nthrough, inter alia, innovative uses of the guarantee\r\nsystems of Ex-Imbanks and so on; special funds for\r\ninvestment; and the expansion of the capital base of the\r\nInternational Finance Corporation.\r\nIn his statement to the high-level meeting on renewal\r\nof the dialogue on strengthening international economic\r\ncooperation for development through partnership on 17\r\nSeptember 1998, Ghana’s Deputy Minister of Trade and\r\nIndustry called for special programmes to build up\r\nAfrica’s international trade and for unhindered market\r\naccess for Africa. I wish to reiterate the call and add that\r\nfairness and justice require that, in the implementation of\r\nthe built-in agenda of the Uruguay Round agreements,\r\nissues in the interest of developing countries, particularly\r\nthose in Africa, should not be relegated to the distant\r\nfuture.\r\nThe way we resolve Africa’s debt burden, especially\r\nofficial debt, will show how serious we are in our\r\ncommitment to the implementation of the UN-NADAF.\r\nThe easiest way to free Africa’s human and economic\r\npotential is to convert all of its official debt to grants. Far\r\nfrom sending the wrong signals to the markets, such an\r\naction would confirm the reality of Africa’s irreversible\r\ncommitment to prudent economic management and good\r\ngovernance.\r\nBefore concluding, we wish to draw particular\r\nattention to the critical issues outlined in section III of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, A/53/390, concerning the\r\nnegative impact of globalization of the world economy on\r\nthe continent of Africa, the need for enhanced\r\ncoordination and feedback between the global political\r\nprocess and the operational levels in the field,\r\nmobilization of financial resources, the appropriateness of\r\nan independent evaluation of the implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda and the need for harmonization of current\r\ninternational and bilateral initiatives on Africa.\r\nAfrica has made its choice to move forward to peace\r\nand prosperity. It is up to the rest of the world to decide\r\nwhether that process will be sustainable and whether its\r\nenormous potential for the peace and prosperity of the\r\nworld itself will be grasped and nurtured.\r\nMr. Koosaletse (Botswana): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s progress report on the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF).\r\nThe report contains a very detailed analysis of constraints\r\nthat continue to impede the economic development of\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nAfrica. We fully share the view that there is a need to\r\nfurther intensify efforts to accelerate the implementation\r\nprocess.\r\nWhile some progress has been made since the\r\nlaunching in 1996 of the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, designed to operationalize the\r\nUN-NADAF, it is disturbing that many of the critical social\r\nand economic problems that led to the adoption of that\r\nframework still persist today. The performance of sub-\r\nSaharan African economies has improved only marginally,\r\nand their integration into the international trading system is\r\nstill a long way from being realized, in spite of the laudable\r\nefforts being exerted by Governments towards institutional\r\nreform measures, the liberalization of trade and financial\r\nregimes and their embracing, by and large, of market-driven\r\neconomic strategies.\r\nThe mid-term review of the UN-NADAF affords us an\r\nopportunity, within that framework, to initiate dialogue on\r\nhow African economies can best be assisted to respond to\r\nthe expected ripple effects of the Asian financial crisis.\r\nObviously, commodities destined for the Asian market will\r\nbe adversely affected, resulting in reduced foreign exchange\r\nearnings. The impact of loss of income on societies already\r\non the margins of survival threatens to erode the progress\r\nachieved so far. Africa cannot afford such an economic\r\nreversal.\r\nIt is noteworthy that this review of the UN-NADAF\r\ncoincides with consideration of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport of April 1998 on the causes of conflict and\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica. Botswana supports the incorporation of some of the\r\nrecommendations put forward in that report into the existing\r\nUN-NADAF framework. We believe the challenge of\r\naddressing the links between peace and development is a\r\nvital part of the debate on these initiatives on Africa.\r\nWhile the numerous initiatives on Africa are\r\nappreciated, not least because they are an indication that the\r\ninternational community is concerned about the problems of\r\nAfrica, Botswana considers it important that the various\r\nactivities should be harmonized through the collaboration of\r\nall partners in order to avoid unnecessary duplication, to\r\nensure the efficient use of resources and to maximize the\r\nimpact of the programmes and projects carried out under\r\nthose initiatives in the recipient countries. In this regard, it\r\nis worth noting that there has been an improvement in the\r\noperational activities of the United Nations system which\r\nhas made it better equipped to discharge its responsibilities.\r\nCoherence of United Nations activities in Botswana is seen\r\nin terms of bringing about less duplication of effort and,\r\nhopefully, savings that could benefit other development\r\nactivities as prioritized in our National Development Plan.\r\nOtherwise, Botswana continues to benefit from the good\r\npartnership it has with the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and its sister agencies.\r\nIt is important in any review exercise to have a clear\r\nidea of performance indicators that serve as a guideline to\r\neffective evaluation. In this regard, we urge Member\r\nStates to cooperate with the United Nations in providing\r\naccurate information and other data necessary for such an\r\nundertaking.\r\nThe issue of lack of funding for the UN-NADAF has\r\nonce again been succinctly outlined in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, and my delegation is deeply concerned\r\nabout the failure of the international community to\r\nsupport this important initiative. We are convinced that\r\nfunding for this initiative can be easily raised only if the\r\ninternational community can muster the political will to\r\ndo so. We appeal to the international community to\r\nredouble its efforts in support of the UN-NADAF.\r\nBotswana shares the view that trade expansion\r\nthrough the broadening of the export base is critical to\r\nany debate on sustainable development in Africa. In this\r\nconnection, Botswana joins those States which call for a\r\nmultilateral trading system which can redress the\r\nanomalies in the current trading system. It is also\r\nnecessary that Africa be assisted in strengthening both its\r\ntrade and financial infrastructures in readiness for its full\r\nintegration into the global economy. To this end, regional\r\neconomic cooperation plays a very important role in the\r\nfacilitation of exports, particularly from small- and\r\nmedium-scale industries. The support it offers to small\r\ninternal markets such as our own is also very critical. The\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) thus\r\ndeserves the support of the international community in the\r\nimplementation of its regional programme.\r\nThe Botswana Government has embraced the private\r\nsector and civil society as partners in the development\r\nprocess. The three are stakeholders in the economy and\r\npossess a remarkable potential in the war against\r\nunemployment and poverty. The intention is to strengthen\r\nthese partnerships in the years to come.\r\nMy delegation is confident that the goals set out in\r\nUN-NADAF are achievable. Africa should continue to\r\nspare no efforts to accomplish them. While the\r\ncontribution of the international community is critical to\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nthe implementation of UN-NADAF, the onus rests on\r\nAfrica to do the rest.\r\nIt is our hope that great strides will have been made\r\nin the implementation of UN-NADAF by both Africa and\r\nthe international community by the next reporting period.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Norway fully concurs with the\r\nviews expressed by the Secretary-General in his report\r\nentitled “The causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa”\r\n(A/52/871). Africa’s challenges have to be addressed in a\r\ncomprehensive manner. Peace, stability and development\r\nare indeed closely interlinked.\r\nLast week the Trade and Development Board of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD) considered its contribution to the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF).\r\nUNCTAD recognized that the economic recovery which\r\nbegan in Africa in 1994 has proved to be fragile. It is\r\nevident that most African nations are not in a position to\r\ntake sufficient advantage of the globalization process. They\r\nare still lagging behind the 6 per cent growth rate set by\r\nUN-NADAF.\r\nThere are a number of reasons for the constraints\r\nencountered by African countries in the global economy,\r\nsuch as lower commodity prices, lack of diversification,\r\ninsufficient access to markets in developed countries, the\r\nunsustainable debt burden and declining official\r\ndevelopment assistance. This situation may be further\r\naggravated by the more recent slowdown in the world\r\neconomy.\r\nNorway has on a number of occasions stated that\r\nnational Governments have a prime responsibility for the\r\ndevelopment of their countries through sound\r\nmacroeconomic policies, respect for human rights, good\r\ngovernance, openness and transparency. We note that\r\nAfrican countries have implemented reform programmes\r\nand encourage them to pursue this path. At the same time,\r\nit is also imperative that sound domestic policies be\r\nsupported by a friendly, inclusive international economic\r\nenvironment.\r\nNorway has recently taken steps to contribute to such\r\nan economic environment for the developing countries in\r\ngeneral and African countries in particular.\r\nOne of the main obstacles to economic and social\r\ndevelopment in Africa is the debt burden. The Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative represents\r\nthe most far-reaching scheme for debt cancellation to\r\ndate. However, we are sensitive to the demands for more\r\nflexibility in the eligibility criteria and for having the\r\nimplementation of the HIPC mechanism speeded up. We\r\nintend to contribute to the strengthening of the HIPC\r\nthrough the recently launched Norwegian debt relief\r\nstrategy, which would benefit a substantial number of\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nThe Norwegian strategy to promote the private\r\nsector in developing countries has as a prime aim the\r\nstimulation of private investments, which are essential for\r\nthe development of a dynamic business sector in African\r\neconomies.\r\nWithin the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nNorway will continue to attach high priority to the\r\nconcerns of the poorest countries. We are actively\r\nsupporting the follow-up of the recommendations of last\r\nyear’s WTO high-level meeting for least developed\r\ncountries and the UNCTAD/International Trade\r\nCentre/WTO joint Integrated Technical Assistance\r\nProgramme for Selected Least Developed and other\r\nAfrican Countries.\r\nNorway has on a number of occasions called for\r\nreversing the present decline in official development\r\nassistance from North to South. The Norwegian\r\nGovernment is currently working on a plan to increase\r\nNorwegian development assistance in the years ahead.\r\nSpecial emphasis will be placed on increased cooperation\r\nwith our African partners. Sectors of particular interest\r\nare poverty alleviation, improved delivery of social\r\nservices and debt reduction.\r\nThe follow-up to the report by the Secretary-General\r\nmust inspire us to more vigorous efforts for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa. We must utilize and further\r\nimprove the existing multilateral mechanisms in this\r\nendeavour. It is essential that all United Nations\r\ninstitutions coordinate and support each other in this task.\r\nIn this context, we look forward to the next review of\r\nUN-NADAF.\r\nMr. Valle (Brazil): The Secretary-General’s report\r\non the progress made in the implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s (UN-NADAF) constitutes a comprehensive\r\nsummary of undertakings and a useful set of further\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nrecommendations for the strengthening of international\r\ncommitments and shared responsibility towards Africa.\r\nThe report combines correct doses of optimism and\r\nrealism by pointing out some concrete positive\r\ndevelopments and at the same time assessing frustrated\r\nefforts and some structural challenges that the African\r\ncontinent still faces.\r\nIt is important to ensure that the progress made in the\r\neconomic and social fields in Africa in the last few years\r\nis consolidated and deepened. Such progress includes\r\nmacroeconomic policy reforms, lower fiscal deficits,\r\nqualitative improvement of budgetary allocations, increased\r\nforeign capital flows, higher growth rates and per capita\r\nincome rise. These achievements must be safeguarded\r\nagainst the negative impact of the current systemic financial\r\ncrisis.\r\nThe United Nations plays a crucial role in mobilizing\r\nand coordinating support and in promoting concrete actions\r\nin favour of African countries. In order to make a\r\ndifference in areas such as trade, finance, technical\r\ncooperation, capacity-building and social development, the\r\nUnited Nations system must continue to implement specific\r\nassistance initiatives, in cooperation with relevant regional\r\norganizations and with the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nThe success of UN-NADAF, however, will rely\r\nultimately on the political will of Governments, in\r\nparticular of multilateral and bilateral donor countries, to\r\nstrengthen their cooperation with Africa. In this context,\r\nurgent solutions must be found to tackle the continued\r\ndecline of official development assistance flows in recent\r\nyears.\r\nSouth-South cooperation is also an important tool\r\nwhich can be further promoted. Middle-income countries\r\nsuch as Brazil have been playing a relevant role in favour\r\nof Africa. Brazil has been deploying significant efforts,\r\nthrough the Brazilian Cooperation Agency and other\r\nnational institutions, to share with African nations its own\r\nexperience in the struggle for development.\r\nAt present, more than 21 per cent of Brazilian bilateral\r\nprojects for technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries are channelled to cooperation with African\r\ncountries. Brazil has been cooperating with African\r\ncountries in a number of strategic areas, such as capacity-\r\nbuilding, health, education, management of agricultural\r\npolicies, tropical agriculture, electric power generation,\r\nmonitoring and exploration of mineral resources. Some of\r\nthese activities are under way through bilateral and\r\ntriangular programmes or are under consideration within\r\nmultilateral initiatives, such as the Community of\r\nPortuguese-Speaking Countries.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on Africa was\r\npreviously the subject of another item on the agenda, and\r\nwe have already presented our comments on it. We\r\nconcur with the integration of development concerns in\r\nAfrica into a broader perspective that lays the foundation\r\nfor durable peace, economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Gambari (Nigeria): I am speaking towards the\r\nend of this debate as the current Chairman of the African\r\nGroup to thank all delegations for their supportive\r\nstatements on this agenda item. In that capacity too, I\r\nwish to recall that at the commencement of this decade —\r\nin 1991 to be precise — the desire of the international\r\ncommunity to halt and reverse the process of economic\r\nrecession in many African countries led to the adoption\r\nby the General Assembly of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF). Bearing in mind the failure of an earlier\r\nprogramme — the United Nations Programme of Action\r\nfor African Economic Recovery and Development, 1986-\r\n1990 — the New Agenda reflected a strong determination\r\non the part of African countries and on the part of their\r\ndevelopment partners that economic growth and\r\ndevelopment should be meaningfully promoted in order to\r\nalleviate poverty in our continent.\r\nHowever, the economic situation in many countries\r\nin the continent remains highly intolerable and very\r\nunsatisfactory. The lacklustre performance of the\r\neconomies of many African countries was well\r\nunderscored in the mid-term review of implementation of\r\nUN-NADAF in 1996, which among other things reminded\r\nthe international community that it must more faithfully\r\nfulfil its commitment to the Agenda.\r\nNotwithstanding the call, in resolution 51/32 on the\r\nmid-term review of the implementation of UN-NADAF,\r\nfor increased commitment by the international\r\ncommunity, the most recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the implementation of UN-NADAF, contained\r\nin document A/53/390, continues to show weak support\r\nby development partners for the development efforts of\r\nAfrican countries. As we count down to the next\r\nmillennium in a world economy characterized by the\r\napparently irreversible phenomenon of globalization, there\r\nis an urgent need to find lasting solutions to the critical\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\neconomic problems of Africa. The case for this remains\r\nvery strong while the Governments of African countries\r\ncontinue to provide and consolidate the necessary enabling\r\nenvironment for development. Between now and 2002,\r\nwhen the next and final review of UN-NADAF will be due,\r\nthe international community should definitely show greater\r\npolitical commitment to the implementation of measures in\r\nareas that are critical for the attainment of sustainable\r\neconomic growth and development in African countries.\r\nThe African continent is currently one of the regions\r\nin the world where returns on foreign investment are\r\nhighest, according to a recent study by the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development. Ironically,\r\nhowever, it is the region receiving the least foreign direct\r\ninvestment. African countries have undertaken measures to\r\nimprove laws and regulations governing foreign direct\r\ninvestment. Foreign direct investment is needed in all\r\nsectors of African countries engaged in reform. The more\r\nthe increase in foreign direct investment, the better the\r\nchances of consolidating economic reforms, creating more\r\njob opportunities and reducing the level of poverty.\r\nWe believe that sustainable development is not\r\ncompatible with debt peonage or a heavy debt burden. Over\r\nthe years, the burden of debt servicing has diverted\r\nsubstantial financial resources away from development in\r\nmany African countries. The various debt strategies put in\r\nplace so far by the international community, including the\r\nrecent Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative,\r\nhave proved to be of limited value in addressing the\r\ndisturbing and unacceptable external debt problems of\r\nAfrican countries. We believe that solutions can be found\r\nwhen there is appropriate and strong political will. African\r\ncountries have started to take adequate internal measures to\r\naddress the problems of external debt management. We\r\ntherefore urge creditor countries to convert into grants all\r\nthe remaining official debts of the poorest African\r\ncountries. The international community should also, without\r\nfurther delay, put in place an international agreement to\r\nclear the entire debt stock of the poorest countries in our\r\ncontinent. The development efforts of African countries will\r\ncontinue to be frustrated so long as those countries remain\r\nin the straitjacket of external indebtedness.\r\nIn addition to the debt overhang of most African\r\ncountries, the flow of development assistance has in recent\r\nyears virtually dried up, at a time it is most needed to\r\nstrengthen the process of economic reform. Foreign aid has\r\ndeclined in volume and in value when it is particularly\r\nrequired to complement national efforts towards the\r\ndevelopment of the social and infrastructure sectors of the\r\neconomy. We commend the efforts of those countries that\r\nhave reached or surpassed the internationally agreed target\r\nfor aid flow to developing countries. African countries are\r\ncurrently consolidating their capacities for the\r\nmobilization of internal resources for development. In the\r\ninterim, a predictable increase in the flow of financial\r\nassistance is urgently needed to make it possible to\r\nimplement measures in priority areas of development. The\r\nprospects for more efficient utilization of foreign aid are\r\nvery high in the emerging environment of good\r\ngovernance and accountability in many countries in our\r\ncontinent.\r\nMay I at this point reiterate firmly that the lack of\r\nmarket access for the export of our products constitutes\r\none of the major current impediments to the promotion of\r\nsustainable economic growth and development in Africa.\r\nRegrettably, Africa’s share of the global market has\r\nremained at about 2 per cent of world trade. The Uruguay\r\nRound of multilateral trade negotiations notwithstanding,\r\nthe many agricultural products from African countries,\r\nincluding textiles, continue to encounter various forms of\r\nbarrier in the markets of developed countries. As a matter\r\nof urgency, these barriers should be speedily dismantled\r\nby the developed countries and access should be granted\r\nto products from African countries. Additionally, the\r\ninternational community should in a more meaningful\r\nway assist African countries to diversify their exports in\r\norder to augment and stabilize foreign exchange earnings\r\nat predictable levels for development. It is our conviction\r\nthat foreign trade is the most vital engine for sustainable\r\neconomic growth and development. Therefore, the\r\ninternational community should help African countries to\r\nrelease the energies in this sector for their development.\r\nThe pursuit of expanded opportunities for foreign\r\ntrade is a key element of our collective efforts to promote\r\ngreater regional and subregional economic cooperation\r\nand integration in Africa. Indeed, regional and subregional\r\nintegration efforts constitute important collective strategies\r\nfor the acceleration of economic growth and development\r\nin our continent. These efforts and arrangements,\r\nincluding for example the African Economic Community,\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States, the\r\nSouthern African Development Community and so on,\r\nbroadly aim at the development of the industrial,\r\nagricultural and infrastructure sectors of African\r\neconomies. Varying progress has been made in the\r\nintegration processes of these communities. However,\r\ntheir effective future consolidation will hinge on more\r\nfinancial and technical support from the international\r\ncommunity. The strengthening of regionalism in Africa\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nwill facilitate the competitiveness of African countries in\r\nthe world economy and ease their integration into the\r\nprocess of true globalization.\r\nAllow me to mention that the adoption of several\r\nmultilateral initiatives for development in Africa is not the\r\nwhole crux of the matter in terms of the long-term\r\ndevelopment of the continent. Indeed, the multiplicity of\r\nsuch initiatives may in fact become counter-productive if\r\nleft unfettered as priorities shift from one initiative to\r\nanother while the efforts themselves remain uncoordinated.\r\nIn order to facilitate the process of sustainable development\r\nand economic growth in Africa, the international\r\ncommunity should harmonize the objectives and strategies\r\nof bilateral and multilateral initiatives. Specifically, and\r\nperhaps above all, additional and sufficient financial\r\nresources should be available to the United Nations system\r\nfor the implementation of specific programmes under these\r\ninitiatives aimed at promoting sustainable development in\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nIn conclusion, the next three years will be very critical\r\nfor UN-NADAF and for its impact on the promotion of\r\nsustainable growth and development in Africa, particularly\r\nat a time when the issue of the root causes of African\r\nconflicts is being seriously addressed by the General\r\nAssembly and by the international community. The global\r\neconomy is undergoing major transformations, whose\r\nbenefits tend to accrue to the developed countries and\r\nwhose disadvantages tend to affect the economically weak\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe implementation of UN-NADAF by the developed\r\npartners regarding external factors critical to development\r\ncalls for increased and sustained political will. We must\r\naccept the reality that the world is now inescapably a global\r\nvillage and that the genuine promotion of development in\r\nAfrica will therefore be for the mutual benefit of all of us:\r\nrich and poor, small and large, developed and developing\r\ncountries of the world.\r\nFinally, in view of the importance which Africa\r\nattaches to UN-NADAF as a vital instrument for assisting\r\nin the social and economic development of our continent,\r\na draft resolution will be introduced on the subject and\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly for its consideration and\r\nadoption at a later date.\r\nMr. Kiwanuka (Uganda): The Uganda delegation\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s progress report on the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). We\r\ncommend him for that thorough analysis.\r\nAfrican development continues to be a major\r\nconcern for many African countries and for their\r\ndevelopment partners. The United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s is one of\r\nmany initiatives on African development by the United\r\nNations. These include the United Nations System-wide\r\nSpecial Initiative on Africa, whose aim was to serve as\r\nthe United Nations implementation arm of UN-NADAF.\r\nAs we all know, UN-NADAF was a mutual\r\ncommitment by African countries and their development\r\npartners to take specific actions in selected areas to\r\npromote sustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment during the 1990s. For African countries,\r\nsuch selected areas included economic reforms, the\r\nintensification of the democratic process, regional\r\ncooperation and integration and South-South cooperation,\r\nhuman resources development, population and\r\ndevelopment, agricultural and rural development,\r\nenvironmental protection, investment promotion, and the\r\nincreased role of civil society, particularly the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nOn their part, Africa’s development partners\r\nexpressed their commitment to support the efforts of\r\nAfrican countries. Specifically, they were called upon to\r\nfacilitate the solution to Africa’s debt problem and\r\nincrease resource flows by ensuring that net official\r\ndevelopment assistance, which amounted to $30 billion in\r\n1992, grew by 4 per cent in real terms thereafter,\r\nproviding market access, supporting economic\r\ndiversification and encouraging foreign direct investment\r\nto Africa.\r\nAs we approach the final review of UN-NADAF in\r\n2002, it is appropriate to take stock now and ask the\r\nquestion: what does the balance sheet show?\r\nOn the African side and in spite of setbacks which\r\nare sometimes quite serious, there have been significant\r\nachievements in a number of areas which were of great\r\nconcern at the beginning of the decade. During the decade\r\nmany African countries embarked on political and\r\neconomic reforms, and there is a growing recognition of\r\nthe role of the private sector. As part of this broad\r\neconomic reform process, open markets, privatization and\r\nthe stabilization of currencies have been championed.\r\nEconomic growth in sub-Saharan Africa has tripled since\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\n1990, and some countries have had growth rates of up to 10\r\nper cent a year.\r\nAllow me at this stage to say something about\r\nUganda’s experience under the leadership of President\r\nMuseveni. During the past 12 years, Uganda’s economy has\r\ngrown at an average rate of 6.5 per cent a year. Inflation\r\nhas been reduced from 250 per cent in 1986 to single digits\r\ntoday. The gross domestic product has doubled. Industry\r\nhas grown at an average rate of 15.1 per cent a year, and\r\nagriculture too has grown at 6.3 per cent a year. Because of\r\nthe introduction of universal primary education as a result\r\nof President Museveni’s commitment in his election\r\nmanifesto, enrolments in primary schools have doubled\r\nsince 1996, from 2.9 million children to 5.5 million today.\r\nPolitical reforms in Africa, especially the strengthening\r\nof democracy, have also taken place in spite of the ongoing\r\ncrises. For our part in Uganda a massive campaign to\r\nempower the people is under way. During this period,\r\nUgandans wrote their own Constitution. Power was\r\ndecentralized from the centre to the local councils, and the\r\nfrontiers of democracy have been extended and expanded\r\nas never before. The climax of this was the decision by\r\nUganda’s head of State, President Museveni, to submit\r\nhimself to the will of the Ugandan electorate. No other\r\nleader since independence has ever submitted himself to the\r\nelectorate of Uganda.\r\nBut these achievements do not mean that the problems\r\nof Uganda and of Africa have gone away. Poverty still\r\npersists, and the agricultural sector is still unmodernized.\r\nThe result is that Africa is still trapped in the role of a\r\nprimary commodity exporter.\r\nThe huge burden that Africa’s external debt has placed\r\non the economies of Africa is unbearable. Africa’s total\r\ndebt as of 1995 was $392 billion. This massive debt\r\noverhang has been, and continues to be, a major obstacle to\r\neconomic growth on the continent as a whole. Although\r\ngrowth rates have improved from 2.7 per cent in 1995 to 4\r\nper cent in 1996, these are still fragile.\r\nThere must be resistance to the idea of a permanent\r\ncategory of poor countries in terms of the debt issue. Any\r\nproposal made must be viewed as a means to allow African\r\nnations to return to solvency and liquidity. In this regard,\r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative\r\nmust not be seen by African Governments as the latest\r\npanacea for all Africa’s problems. A speedy, flexible, case-\r\nby-case approach will allow more African countries to\r\nqualify for assistance under the HIPC Initiative. This must\r\nbe seen as a way out of persistent external indebtedness\r\nand a return to vigorous growth.\r\nHere allow me to echo the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, that there should be\r\nan across-the-board conversion into grants of all the\r\nofficial debts of African countries. This may sound like\r\na far-reaching proposal, but it is not new. It has been\r\nmade at numerous international forums, notably at\r\nmeetings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment and of the Development Committee of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Again\r\nin his report to the Security Council in April this year, the\r\nSecretary-General not only forcefully proposed the\r\nconversion into grants of all remaining official bilateral\r\ndebt of the poorest African countries, he also urged the\r\nBretton Woods institutions to significantly ease and\r\nquicken access to facilities for those heavily indebted\r\npoor countries and to provide sufficient resources to\r\nenable them to attain a substantial and sustained pace of\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nThe benefit of debt cancellation, for example, is that\r\nif African Governments were relieved of the stress of debt\r\noverhang, they could better utilize their resources for\r\neconomic development. There is also a moral argument\r\nassociated with the concept of a total debt write-off. The\r\nso-called jubilee argument has been made by religious\r\nleaders recently. The Lambeth Conference of Anglican\r\nbishops in a recent statement on debt said that their\r\nlordships embraced the principle of debt cancellation and\r\ncalled on the World Bank to consider the cancellation of\r\nthose loans.\r\nIn discussing market-access issues, we must stress\r\nthat Africa’s trading opportunities will depend on the\r\nextent to which the continent’s trading pattern is\r\nintegrated into the world trading system and its productive\r\ncapacity. However, it is important to note that Africa’s\r\nshare of world trade continues to decline. Estimates\r\nindicate that the declines in 1996 and 1997 were about 2\r\nper cent and 1.9 per cent respectively. In 1997 the volume\r\nof world trade increased by 9.4 per cent, and Africa’s\r\ntrade volume increased by 8 per cent. This increase in\r\nexport volume was fuelled by an increase in oil\r\nproduction, which was estimated at 66.8 million tons for\r\n1997.\r\nLet me now turn to the need for industrialization.\r\nIndustrial development is a key element of sustainable\r\neconomic growth. It helps countries to achieve important\r\nsocial objectives such as jobs, employment and equity. It\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\ncreates opportunities for the integration of women. Along\r\nwith agricultural development in rural areas, it can help\r\nstem migration and relieve pressure on cities. With\r\nindustrial development the continent can take decisive steps\r\ntowards full-throttle competition in the globalized\r\nmarketplace. But without it, as African leaders declared at\r\nthe 1997 Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit in\r\nHarare, African economies will be condemned to persistent\r\ncrisis, dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening\r\npoverty, despair and political unrest.\r\nIn 1997, the United Nations Industrial Development\r\nOrganization focused on the development of small- and\r\nmedium-scale industries. Given the prominence of the\r\nprivate sector, it was quite appropriate that the theme for\r\nthe celebration of Africa Industrialization Day in 1997 was\r\nthe development of small- and medium-scale industries.\r\nSuch enterprises are the backbone of economic activity in\r\nAfrica. They are a major source of livelihoods and income.\r\nThe majority of them are small- and medium-sized, but\r\nthey account for a large share of the jobs created in the\r\neconomy. Many are individual or family-owned operations\r\nwith a great ability to adjust rapidly to changing market\r\nconditions. With trade liberalization and deregulation the\r\nrole of these small- and medium-sized enterprises has\r\nincreased tremendously. In both the formal and informal\r\nsectors, small entrepreneurs are playing a pivotal role in\r\nalleviating poverty and promoting economic progress.\r\nAs regards regional cooperation, in recent years a\r\nglobal consensus has emerged on the need for closer\r\nregional cooperation and integration so as to overcome the\r\nsmall, unintegrated African markets and so that we are able\r\nto face up to the challenges of the 1990s. In addition to the\r\nrecognition that regional cooperation and integration are\r\nabsolute necessities for Africa in the coming years, there is\r\na broad consensus today on a number of principles that\r\ncould guide the new phase of regionalism in Africa. But for\r\nregional integration to take place, a number of key factors\r\nare essential, including macroeconomic policies, broader\r\ncivil participation and regional policies to ensure\r\nredistribution of benefits.\r\nA number of developments indicate that the “new”\r\nregionalism in Africa today may have a better chance of\r\nsuccess than previous attempts. It has not only the\r\nadvantage of being able to draw lessons from past\r\nexperiences in Africa and elsewhere, but also the benefit of\r\na more favourable international environment. The new\r\nregional groupings such as the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States, the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity, the East African Cooperation, the Common\r\nMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa and so forth have\r\nbenefitted from past experiences.\r\nUganda recognizes that the success of regional\r\ninitiatives ultimately hinges on the will of Africa itself.\r\nNevertheless, external support in the form of financial and\r\ntechnical cooperation is being called upon to play an\r\nessential role. This includes providing assistance to\r\nregional transport and communication networks, as well\r\nas to support services, capacity-building and the removal\r\nof barriers to trade and factor movements; better monetary\r\ncooperation; and, more generally, an international trading\r\nenvironment that is conducive to the integration efforts of\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nLet me now turn to conflicts. In his report, “The\r\ncauses of conflicts and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa”, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral put a finger on a major hindrance to African\r\ndevelopment. Many African leaders have long shared with\r\nthe international community alarm at the persistence of\r\ndeadly conflicts and humanitarian crises. The risk is that\r\nAfrica gets locked in an endless process of crisis\r\nmanagement. This is a real danger because lurching from\r\none crisis to another makes it difficult to focus attention\r\non the long-term structural transformations that are\r\nrequired for sustainable economic and social development.\r\nUnfortunately, serious focus by the international\r\ncommunity on Africa has diminished. The slowness of the\r\nSecurity Council and the international community to\r\nrespond to the steady deterioration in the security and\r\nhumanitarian situation in many parts of Africa is a matter\r\nof great concern. Needless to say, we call upon the\r\ninternational community to support and strengthen the\r\nOAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\r\nand Resolution.\r\nFinally, let me express my delegation’s satisfaction\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s progress report and conclude\r\non a note of promising development which truly\r\nrepresents the spirit of global partnership with Africa.\r\nEarly this year, President Clinton visited Africa. The visit\r\nwas a turning point in United States policy towards\r\nAfrica. A joint communiqué was issued at the end of the\r\nEntebbe Summit for Peace and Prosperity in March 1998\r\nwhich eight heads of State or Government attended. The\r\nfact that eight heads of State or Government signed the\r\ncommuniqué was significant, because they committed\r\nthemselves to putting partnership into practice and to\r\nbuild those partnerships on principles and shared values.\r\nThey said,\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\n“The Heads of State and Government recognize\r\nthat to effect this new, genuine and transparent\r\npartnership, there is a need to commit ourselves to the\r\nidentification and acknowledgement of both our\r\nmutual and divergent interests, the pursuit of free and\r\nfrank discussions and a clear understanding of the\r\nroles and responsibilities of each partner.”\r\n(S/1998/307, annex, third paragraph)\r\nThey went on to say,\r\n“The Heads of State and Government recognize\r\nthat a lasting partnership must be built on the\r\nprinciples of shared ownership, joint responsibility and\r\nfull transparency.” (ibid., fourth paragraph)\r\nMr. Mabilangan (Philippines): Let me first join other\r\ndelegations in congratulating the Secretary-General on his\r\nexcellent reports on agenda item 24 of the present session.\r\nMy delegation fully associates itself with the statement by\r\nthe representative of Indonesia, who spoke on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nWith the adoption of the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF),\r\nthe international community unequivocally committed itself\r\nto supporting the development efforts of all countries in\r\nAfrica. The New Agenda and its subsequent mid-term\r\nreview are clear on the efforts required to put the countries\r\nof the African continent on the road to economic recovery\r\nand prosperity.\r\nThe African countries themselves have made their best\r\nefforts to contribute their part in revitalizing their economy\r\nand sustaining the process of their development despite\r\nfinancial and other serious constraints. In this regard, it may\r\nbe instructive to refer to the progress report of the\r\nSecretary-General on this subject, which indicated, among\r\nother things, that, since the mid-term review, African\r\ncountries have deepened the progress that had previously\r\nbeen achieved in several fields.\r\nIt is critical, however, that the development process\r\nnow under way in the African continent must not be\r\ncurtailed or reversed so that real progress in terms of\r\nuplifting the material conditions of the peoples of Africa\r\nwill continue. It is therefore critical that appropriate action\r\nbe implemented at the international level to insulate them\r\nfrom the financial crisis raging in some parts of the world.\r\nAt the same time, it is important for the international\r\ncommunity to see to it that all the required measures\r\nidentified in UN-NADAF and in its mid-term review are\r\ncarried out to the fullest.\r\nAmong other measures, these require the promotion\r\nof the private sector and foreign direct investment in the\r\nAfrican countries, the expansion of market access for the\r\nexport products of African countries, diversification of\r\nAfrican economies and commodities, the provision of\r\nadequate and predictable sources of external financing and\r\nthe resolution of the serious external indebtedness of\r\nmany African countries.\r\nAs reported in document A/53/390, since the mid-\r\nterm review certain African countries have encouraged\r\nprivatization as an instrument of resource mobilization,\r\nwhile others have created a more enabling environment\r\nfor attracting foreign direct investment. My delegation\r\ncertainly encourages them to persist in the efforts aimed\r\nat promoting private sector participation in their\r\neconomies. We also encourage the enhancement of\r\nforeign direct investment for the development of Africa.\r\nIn this regard, the international community, including the\r\nfinancial institutions, must provide the necessary support,\r\ninvolving a wide range of measures, including the\r\nimprovement of the physical, institutional and social\r\ninfrastructures in order to attract further foreign and\r\ndomestic investments.\r\nAccording to the report of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),\r\nAfrica ships only about 0.37 per cent of global exports\r\nand about 1.4 per cent of exports from the developing\r\nworld. It is clear that unless the African countries are\r\naccorded the opportunity to expand their earning potential\r\nthrough the exports of their goods and services, there is\r\nnot much hope for a sustained path to progress in the\r\ncontinent. The UN-NADAF and its mid-term review\r\ncontain specific references for concrete action that must\r\nbe implemented to support the exports of the countries in\r\nAfrica. My delegation therefore calls on the international\r\ncommunity, particularly the developed countries, to\r\nimplement measures that would expand market access for\r\nthe products of the African countries.\r\nThe effective mobilization of financial resources is\r\nextremely necessary for the African continent. Unless\r\nsufficient resources are at the disposal of African\r\ncountries, it will be impossible to sustain the process\r\nunder way for the revitalization of their economies. It is\r\nthus troubling to note the observation in document\r\nA/53/390/Add.1 that gross domestic savings have been\r\nconsistently declining in Africa. It is equally disquieting\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nto note that Africa’s share of total resource flows to\r\ndeveloping countries not only was reduced from 15.4 per\r\ncent in 1992 to 7.4 per cent in 1996, but also has fluctuated\r\nfrom year to year, the main reason for which, of course,\r\nwas the declining trend of official development assistance.\r\nClosely related to the mobilization of resources is the\r\nquestion of providing a definitive resolution to the\r\nenormous external indebtedness of many African countries.\r\nAgain, unless a durable solution to their external debt and\r\ndebt-servicing problems is in place, there will be a\r\nconsiderable drain in the resources which could otherwise\r\nbe channelled to support development efforts. In this\r\nregard, I wish to refer to what I indicated in my statement\r\non agenda item 164, “Causes of conflict and the promotion\r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in Africa”:\r\nthat serious consideration should be accorded to the\r\nOrganization of African Unity’s framework for action on\r\ndebt, which called for an international agreement to clear\r\nthe entire debt stock of the poorest countries in Africa\r\nwithin a reasonably short period of time, and in the context\r\nof Africa’s overall economic reforms.\r\nThe Secretary-General himself noted that\r\n“Significant movement on lifting Africa’s\r\ncrippling debt burden will require concerted political\r\naction at the highest levels.” (A/52/871, para. 95)\r\nThe road to economic recovery and the required\r\nmeasures to sustain the path to development in the African\r\ncontinent have been well laid out in UN-NADAF and in its\r\nmid-term review. The international community needs only\r\nto be conscientious with regard to the commitments\r\nembodied in those documents and thereby dutifully make\r\nthe best efforts to support Africa’s development.\r\nI am confident that our solidarity with all the peoples\r\nof the continent of Africa will provide the required\r\nmomentum aimed at the full and effective implementation\r\nof the New Agenda.\r\nMr. Chulkov (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): Russia attaches great importance to all\r\nforms of cooperation that can help to ensure the\r\ndevelopment of countries and regions. We consider the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nin the 1990s (UN-NADAF), adopted by the General\r\nAssembly in 1991, to be a basic document for conjoining\r\nnational efforts with the activities of the United Nations\r\nsystem with a view to the comprehensive development of\r\nthe African continent. We support such key goals of\r\nUN-NADAF as coordinating efforts at the national,\r\nregional and international levels; ensuring that the\r\ndevelopment of Africa becomes one of the international\r\ncommunity’s priorities; and helping to establish conditions\r\nconducive to development efforts being made in Africa.\r\nThe Russian delegation welcomes the growing\r\nparticipation of African States in world affairs and their\r\nconstructive contribution to strengthening international\r\nand regional security. We happily note the positive trends\r\nin the sphere of political and economic reform and the\r\nestablishment of integration mechanisms in Africa.\r\nThe General Assembly’s recent consideration of the\r\nitem on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nconfirmed that the success of the strategy lies in the\r\nsettlement of the numerous conflicts in Africa and in\r\nensuring the political stabilization of the region. Helping\r\nto settle inter-State and internal conflict situations in the\r\nregion is a priority of Russian policy in Africa.\r\nUN-NADAF reflects the desire of the African\r\ncountries and the international community to develop\r\ncooperation as a contribution to promoting sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Our delegation largely agrees with the\r\nconclusions of the mid-term review of the programme and\r\nbelieves that, in order to accomplish this task,\r\nGovernments, local governing bodies, non-governmental\r\norganizations and the international community need to\r\nunite their efforts.\r\nResponsibility for development and for building\r\neffective economic policy lies — quite appropriately, in\r\nour view — with countries themselves. At the same time,\r\na very important role in the process is played by\r\ninternational cooperation and the establishment of\r\nconditions conducive to development. This is particularly\r\ntopical in the case of African countries, many of which,\r\nwith every good intention, are simply unable by\r\nthemselves, in today’s circumstances, to break out of the\r\nvicious circle of socio-economic problems exacerbated by\r\nthe burdens and consequences of the current global\r\nfinancial and economic crisis.\r\nGiven the current realities, one of the foremost tasks\r\nof the international community in helping Africa is to\r\nmake the best choice of priorities. Russia reconfirms its\r\nposition on the advisability of shifting attention from\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance to support for long-\r\nterm projects that will strengthen and develop the\r\ncountries’ own creative potential. We believe that it is\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 47th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 28 October 1998\r\nimportant to continue to seek ways of reducing the debt\r\nburden of the African States and to provide conditions in\r\nwhich their products enjoy access to markets.\r\nI would mention, as an example of the Russian\r\ncontribution to the development of African countries, the\r\nwork carried out in Africa by our Ministry of Civil\r\nDefence, Emergencies and Natural Disasters. In particular,\r\nI would point to the successful automotive school project in\r\nRwanda, aimed at promoting national capacities in the\r\ndelivery of humanitarian supplies in Africa, which is\r\nalready developing at the regional level.\r\nAn important element of the successful development\r\nof African economies is strengthening coordination between\r\ndonor countries and various international institutions to\r\nensure more coordinated work in the implementation of\r\ndecisions of the United Nations global conferences.\r\nThrough multilateral and bilateral cooperation in Africa,\r\na whole series of mutually reduplicating programmes are\r\nbeing implemented. In this connection, we feel it very\r\nimportant to avoid any dissipation of effort and would\r\nrecommend, in implementing this task, enhancing the\r\nUnited Nations coordinating role in providing assistance\r\nto Africa. We also advocate the more active involvement\r\nof certain agencies, including the World Bank, in\r\nimplementing the United Nations Special Initiatives on\r\nAfrica.\r\nRussia welcomes the African development initiatives\r\nthat bolster UN-NADAF. In particular, we note the results\r\nof the recent second Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development. The final document adopted there,\r\nentitled “African Development Towards the 21st Century:\r\nThe Tokyo Agenda for Action”, shows a growing\r\nunderstanding of the fact that finding a solution to the\r\nproblems of Africa is becoming a priority task for the\r\nworld community. We support the statement made by the\r\nRussian Federation at the Tokyo Conference to the effect\r\nthat Russia is ready to participate in projects in Africa,\r\nincluding international ones, especially in the\r\nhumanitarian area and in demining.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers that a draft resolution on this item will be\r\nsubmitted to the Secretariat at a later date.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
