(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work\r\nLetter from the Chairman of the Committee on\r\nConferences (A/53/298/Add.2)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): This\r\nmorning I should like first of all to draw the attention of\r\nrepresentatives to document A/53/298/Add.2, which\r\ncontains a letter dated 27 October 1998 addressed to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly by the Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Conferences.\r\nAs members are aware, the Assembly, in section I,\r\nparagraph 7 of its resolution 40/243, decided that no\r\nsubsidiary organ of the General Assembly may meet at\r\nUnited Nations Headquarters during a regular session of the\r\nAssembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.\r\nAs indicated in the letter I have just mentioned, the\r\nCommittee on Conferences has recommended that the\r\nGeneral Assembly authorize the Special Committee to\r\nInvestigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of\r\nthe Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied\r\nTerritories to meet in New York from 2 to 5 November\r\n1998, during the main part of the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly wishes to\r\nadopt the recommendation of the Committee on\r\nConferences?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 22\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Committee\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/306)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.9)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of India to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.9.\r\nMr. Rao (India): As I am taking the floor for the\r\nfirst time in the General Assembly, may I be permitted to\r\npay my personal tribute to you, Sir, having known you\r\nfor some time as a colleague of high distinction and great\r\nhuman consideration and with great qualities of leadership\r\nand a gift to contribute to the high ideals of the United\r\nNations. It is therefore fitting that you occupy the high\r\noffice of President of the General Assembly this year. I\r\nwish you and your colleagues on the Bureau every\r\nsuccess in all your endeavours.\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nTurning to the agenda item under consideration, over\r\nthe last 40 years, the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee (AALCC) has acquired a unique stature in\r\npromoting legal cooperation among Asian and African\r\nStates in the important field of international law. With the\r\nestablishment of a permanent headquarters in New Delhi,\r\nthe Committee is all set to intensify its work and aim at\r\nachieving higher and more broad-based goals in the\r\ndischarge of its mandate. Its initiatives were well received\r\nat the various United Nations conferences, particularly those\r\ndealing with the law of treaties and the law of the sea, and\r\nhave immensely contributed to a world order that is\r\nuniversally respected and treated as fair and equitable for\r\nall States.\r\nThe annual conferences of the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee are major events in international\r\nlaw and the New Delhi session this year in April was well\r\nattended. Ministers and senior officers of member States\r\nand several observer delegations and representatives of\r\nvarious international organizations participated and\r\ncontributed to the value of the deliberations. The exchange\r\nof views on contemporary issues of international law,\r\nincluding subjects being studied by the International Law\r\nCommission and issues arising in connection with the\r\nimplementation of the world trade regime, proved and will\r\nprove highly beneficial to member States and other\r\nparticipants.\r\nThese views were duly communicated by the\r\nSecretary-General of the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee to the United Nations, of which it has the\r\ndistinction of being an observer, and to the International\r\nlaw Commission, whose sessions he regularly attends.\r\nIn addition to the annual meetings, discussions are also\r\nheld in special sessions of the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee. Specials sessions held on the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, the law\r\nconcerning reservations to treaties, the treatment of\r\nrefugees, the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the\r\ninternational legal order and the proposed meetings on the\r\nlaw of the world trade regime and the review of procedures\r\non the settlement of disputes are some recent examples of\r\nits work this year. Reports of the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee and other declarations adopted by\r\nthe Committee as a result of these special sessions have\r\nbecome an important source for the development of\r\ninternational law and are an expression of the views and\r\ninterests of Asian and African States. It is particularly\r\nnoteworthy that, through these efforts, the Committee has\r\nbeen dedicating its efforts to identify the common interests\r\nof Africa and Asia on a variety of contemporary issues\r\nbefore the United Nations and other world bodies and, in\r\nthe process, is helping the evolution of a fair, just,\r\nequitable and universal legal order.\r\nIt is a matter of great pride for all of us that the\r\nCommittee is one of the few international organizations\r\nwhich function on a very economical budget. Its annual\r\nbudget is among the lowest for such intergovernmental\r\norganizations. From seven States initially, it has now\r\ngrown to become an organization with 45 member States\r\nand has further plans to expand.\r\nWe would like to encourage the Committee to\r\nexpand its activities. The Committee has several forward-\r\nlooking plans for the benefit of its member States. In this\r\nregard, mention could be made of special training\r\nprogrammes for promoting teaching and expertise in legal\r\nadvising in international law; the establishment of special\r\nchairs in international law teaching in various universities\r\nof member States; the offer of fellowships to Asian and\r\nAfrican students to pursue higher studies in international\r\nlaw; and encouragement of the publication of books and\r\nperiodicals devoted to the cause of international law and\r\nof special interest to Asia and Africa.\r\nIt may also be noted that the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee was established to provide\r\nexpertise in international law to the Asian and African\r\nStates and specific assistance and advice, upon request, on\r\nany topic of international law to those member States.\r\nSuch advice could be rendered, for example, on\r\ndeveloping a suitable legal framework or legislation for\r\nthe implementation of international treaties; on providing\r\na model agreement to establish joint cooperative\r\narrangements; or on rendering an opinion on a given\r\nsubject to one or more member States.\r\nIt is well understood, however, that some of these\r\nactivities can be pursued and their aims successfully\r\nachieved only with the availability of more funds. The\r\nclearance of arrears in contributions and raising funds\r\nthrough voluntary contributions could be of some help.\r\nIt is a matter of great pride to note that, in spite of\r\nits financial limitations, the work of the Committee is\r\nefficiently organized by a small but dedicated band of\r\ninternational law experts working under the guidance of\r\nan international diplomatic staff, including its most\r\ncompetent Secretary-General. It has an excellent library.\r\nThese facilities can and should be further improved. In\r\ndue course of time, the Committee could operate as an\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\ninternational law documentation centre for the benefit of the\r\nAsian and African States.\r\nWe are very optimistic that, in the years to come, the\r\nCommittee will pay greater attention to many of these\r\naspects and achieve greater glory in clarifying and\r\nconsolidating the common interests of Asian and African\r\nStates — and indeed, I might say, the common interests of\r\nthe international community. It will also surely enhance its\r\nactivities in training and the dissemination of international\r\nlaw expertise among Asian and African States. Such a step\r\nwould further strengthen the role of Asian and African\r\nStates in evolving a just, fair, equitable and universal legal\r\norder for all States. We have no doubt that, in this great\r\nendeavour, the cooperation between AALCC and the United\r\nNations will continue to grow stronger and stronger. We\r\nwish the Committee and its members every success and\r\nhope that the United Nations and its membership will\r\ncontinue to provide it with needed strength, support and\r\nassistance.\r\nI would ask the General Assembly to adopt the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/53/L.9, which is now\r\nsponsored by a number of delegations: Bangladesh, China,\r\nEgypt, Ghana, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, Japan, Kenya, Myanmar, the Philippines, Sri Lanka\r\nand Sudan.\r\nMr. Herndl (Austria): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries associated with the Union — the Czech\r\nRepublic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated country,\r\nCyprus, align themselves with this statement.\r\nItem 22 of the General Assembly’s agenda, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee”, offers an\r\nopportunity, every two years, to appreciate and assess an\r\nongoing process of cooperation which from modest\r\nbeginnings in 1980 has evolved into a fruitful relationship\r\nbenefiting both partners. The mutual exchange of ideas and\r\nthoughts, of reflections and practical considerations in the\r\nfield of international law and international legal cooperation\r\nis a hallmark of this relationship.\r\nI wish to thank the Secretary-General for his report in\r\ndocument A/53/306, which elucidates the framework of the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee and the areas in\r\nwhich concrete action has taken place. Two years ago, the\r\nEuropean Union had occasion to speak, in the present\r\ncontext, of a veritable embarras de richesse. This\r\nstatement still holds true. The Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee, whose legal coordination\r\nactivities span two continents, is participating actively in\r\nthe programmes of the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law and in programmes on environment and\r\nsustainable development. Those areas were explicitly\r\nmentioned in General Assembly resolution 51/11, adopted\r\nin November 1996. The field of cooperation is, however,\r\nstill expanding.\r\nThe European Union notes with satisfaction the\r\npositive relationship which the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee has established with the\r\nInternational Law Commission. In paragraph 22 of its\r\nlatest annual report, document A/53/10, the Commission\r\nrefers to a “useful dialogue on subjects of common\r\ninterest”, conducted with the Consultative Committee. As\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report points out, the Consultative\r\nCommittee has undertaken analytical work on the issue of\r\nreservations, currently under study by the International\r\nLaw Commission. This led the Commission’s Special\r\nRapporteur on reservations to state that he was favourably\r\nimpressed by the interest shown in the relevant work of\r\nthe Commission, as illustrated by, inter alia, the work\r\ndone on the topic of reservations by the Asian-African\r\nLegal Consultative Committee.\r\nSince the last discussion of this item by the General\r\nAssembly, the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee, in cooperation with the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross, has also held a special\r\nmeeting on the interrelated aspects of international\r\nhumanitarian law and the future International Criminal\r\nCourt, thus offering an additional opportunity for an\r\ninformal exchange of views on the issues related to the\r\ncreation of such a court — issues which at that stage\r\nwere debated within the Preparatory Committee on the\r\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court. The\r\nConsultative Committee in fact participated in the famous\r\nRome Conference which resulted in the adoption of the\r\nStatute of the Court.\r\nWhat we are thus witnessing is an ever evolving\r\ncooperative relationship between the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee and the United Nations which, if\r\nI may say so, has a positive impact on the work of the\r\nSixth Committee of the General Assembly. The\r\nConsultative Committee is closely following the\r\nprogressive codification of international law through the\r\nInternational Law Commission. It is also cooperating with\r\nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\n(UNCITRAL) in the area of trade law in general and more\r\nparticularly in the area of insolvency law, with the\r\ninternational bodies set up in the field of the law of the sea,\r\nwith the World Trade Organization and with humanitarian\r\ninstitutions, particularly the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. In this respect, it is\r\nworth noting that as early as 1966, the Consultative\r\nCommittee elaborated principles concerning the treatment\r\nof refugees — the so-called Bangkok Principles.\r\nIn conclusion, the European Union expresses the wish\r\nthat the fruitful cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee, which we\r\nare witnessing, will continue in the future to the mutual\r\nbenefit of both partners.\r\nMr. Mirzaee Yengejeh (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nAllow me to begin by expressing the appreciation of my\r\ndelegation to the Secretary-General for his report on the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee, contained in\r\ndocument A/53/306.\r\nFour decades ago we, the Asian and African nations,\r\nestablished the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee\r\n(AALCC) in order to play an active role in bringing the\r\nrule of law into international relations and to participate\r\nactively in the lawmaking process in the international arena.\r\nSince its inception, the AALCC has undertaken a number\r\nof studies in the field of international legal matters of\r\ncommon concern to the two continents. Moreover, it has\r\nfunctioned as an important forum for exchange of views\r\nand information among its member States. It has played a\r\nsignificant role in exploring and harmonizing the needs,\r\nviews and positions of African and Asian countries\r\nconcerning various aspects of lawmaking at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nA common objective — striving for the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law and its codification —\r\nlinks the AALCC with the United Nations. It was that\r\ncommon aim that led to commencement of cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations after the foundation of the\r\nAALCC in 1956. By the granting of observer status to the\r\nAALCC in 1980, this flourishing cooperation was\r\ninstitutionalized and continues to this day. The Consultative\r\nCommittee continues to accord priority in its programme of\r\nwork to the topics on the General Assembly’s agenda. It\r\nhas undertaken a systematic and consistent examination of\r\nitems on the agenda of the Sixth Committee and the\r\nInternational Law Commission from Asian and African\r\nperspectives. Moreover, areas of cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations is not limited to the field of\r\ninternational law but covers economic, environmental and\r\nhumanitarian areas as well.\r\nIn the last two years the Consultative Committee\r\ncarried out a number of noteworthy activities and\r\nconstructively participated in the major legal projects of\r\nthe United Nations. The question of refugees remained\r\none of the priority items on the agenda of the\r\nConsultative Committee, and, with the cooperation of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees (UNHCR), two seminars were held — in\r\nManila and Tehran — in the years under review. With the\r\nobjective of preparing a piece of model legislation, the\r\nquestion of the legal protection of migrant workers has\r\nbeen placed on the agenda of the Consultative Committee.\r\nAnother new item, “Extraterritorial application of national\r\nlegislation: sanctions imposed against third parties”, which\r\nhas relevance to the activities of the United Nations in the\r\nareas of free trade and economic development, has been\r\nplaced on the agenda of the AALCC.\r\nI wish to stress the significant contribution of the\r\nAALCC in the exercises that led to the adoption of the\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court on 17 July\r\n1998 in Rome. The Consultative Committee, with the\r\ncooperation of the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross (ICRC), organized a special meeting on the\r\nestablishment of an international criminal court during its\r\nthirty-sixth annual session in Tehran. At that meeting the\r\ninterrelated aspects of international humanitarian law and\r\nthe international criminal court were discussed by the\r\nparticipants and experts from the ICRC. Consultations\r\namong member States of the AALCC on this topic\r\ncontinued in Rome during the Diplomatic Conference on\r\nthe establishment of the International Criminal Court.\r\nIn conclusion, the report before the General\r\nAssembly illustrates in detail the very constructive\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the AALCC\r\nin the last two years. We feel that prospects for future\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee are quite bright.\r\nThis is why the Islamic Republic of Iran has co-sponsored\r\nthe draft resolution on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee, contained in document A/53/L.9, and\r\nexpresses its hope that the draft resolution will receive the\r\nunanimous support of the Assembly.\r\nMr. De Saram (Sri Lanka): The Asian-African\r\nLegal Consultative Committee (AALCC) is an\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\norganization with a large membership, a vast geographical\r\nscope and a record of work in several fields of international\r\nlegal interest. Above all else, it is an organization with an\r\nimportant and broad purpose — that of promoting and\r\ndeveloping greater awareness in the international legal\r\ncommunities of Africa and Asia of the many, the ever\r\nexpanding, the often very complex, contemporary\r\ndevelopments in the fields of public and private\r\ninternational law.\r\nIt is only natural, therefore, that there should be a\r\ncooperative relationship between the AALCC and the\r\nUnited Nations — a relationship whose personifications for\r\nthose of us who work in the corridors, the lounges and the\r\nconference rooms of the United Nations here in New York,\r\nare, of course, on the United Nations side of the\r\nrelationship: the Legal Counsel of the United Nations,\r\nUnder-Secretary-General Hans Corell, and his colleagues in\r\nthe United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, and, on the side\r\nof the AALCC, the ever present and ever informative figure\r\nof the Permanent Observer of the AALCC, Ambassador\r\nBhagwat-Singh.\r\nIf the development of a network of formal and\r\ninformal relationships between the AALCC and the United\r\nNations and the dissemination of documentation and\r\ninformation on the numerous legal happenings at the United\r\nNations are essential to a cooperative relationship, it is\r\ncrucial that we also remind ourselves from time to time that\r\nthe ultimate objective of the AALCC — its ultimate long-\r\nterm responsibility in its relationship with the United\r\nNations — is surely that of moving its vast African and\r\nAsian membership collectively forward to the stage at\r\nwhich all will be in a position to participate fully and\r\neffectively in the many and various multilateral legal\r\nforums in which the United Nations system of organizations\r\nabounds.\r\nIt is a formidable objective that requires a formidable\r\nendeavour. Yet it is an endeavour that surely must be made.\r\nThe processes of consultation and coordination among\r\nrepresentatives having a measure of commonality of interest\r\nis necessary in international parliamentary diplomacy. It is\r\nfundamental here at the United Nations, in the multilateral\r\ninternational legal context, where, as we all know, legal and\r\nother technicalities intertwine with political and other\r\nsubtleties in time-consuming debate, negotiation and the\r\nexamination of draft texts that are sometimes far from clear\r\nas to their specific purpose.\r\nThe practice of consultation and coordination is one\r\nthat other regional groups having commonalities of\r\ninterests have already achieved. Some, I feel sure, have,\r\nin the practice of consultation and coordination, achieved\r\na high and desirable degree of facility and sophistication.\r\nThose of us from Africa and Asia still have a long\r\nway to go. The difficulties are compounded by the\r\npractical disadvantages with which we are still\r\nencumbered, certainly in the legal field: absence of\r\nadequate access, or sometimes no access whatsoever, to\r\ndocumentation and legal periodicals and to centres of\r\nlegal research and analysis. We are disadvantaged as well,\r\nit is clear, when we face the far greater resources with\r\nwhich larger delegations and larger Permanent Missions\r\nare clearly blessed.\r\nThus, it is inevitable that for many of us, as member\r\nStates of the AALCC, the ultimate goal is an imperative:\r\nfull and effective consultation and coordination in\r\npreparations for legal meetings, which require the\r\nidentification of issues and the marshalling of necessary\r\ninformation and of precise and comprehensive\r\nargumentation.\r\nIf there are to be truly meaningful proceedings in the\r\nmultilateral legal context here at the United Nations, then\r\nall States in all legal deliberative bodies must surely stand\r\non the same plateau of awareness and knowledge. It is a\r\ndifficult and distant goal. Yet it is one that we in the\r\nUnited Nations and, particularly, we in the AALCC, must\r\nstrive to achieve.\r\nI look forward to working with colleagues in the\r\nAALCC, and indeed with colleagues outside of the\r\nAALCC, in determining how we in the AALCC might\r\nbest achieve such coordinative and consultative\r\nmechanisms and procedures.\r\nFinally, may I convey my profound respects and\r\nvery best wishes to the Secretary-General of the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee, Mr. Tang, and to\r\nhis colleagues. I shall look forward to consulting with\r\nthem on some of the matters of which I have just spoken.\r\nMr. Yin Yubiao (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): At the outset, I would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee (AALCC). We shall soon be\r\nhearing a statement by Mr. Tang Chengyuan, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the AALCC. We are very pleased to note the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nstrengthening of relations and the broadening of the scope\r\nof the cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nAs an intergovernmental consultative body of Asian\r\nand African countries on legal matters, the AALCC has\r\nbeen dedicated since its inception to consultation and\r\ncoordination among its member States on legal matters; it\r\nhas followed and studied the latest developments in the\r\nfield of international law and has conducted in-depth studies\r\nof legal matters of common concern to Asian and African\r\ncountries; it has achieved positive results. Experience shows\r\nthat the AALCC has not only provided a forum for\r\ndiscussion and cooperation between Asian and African\r\ncountries on legal questions and other matters of common\r\nconcern but has also contributed to the progressive\r\ndevelopment and codification of international law. Through\r\nall these endeavours it has established itself as a regional\r\norganization with unique influence in the field of law. We\r\nare confident that, with the passage of time, this influence\r\nwill further increase.\r\nSince becoming an observer in the General Assembly,\r\nthe AALCC has developed closer ties of cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations. The annual meetings of the AALCC are\r\nattended not only by the representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations but also by representatives\r\nof the International Law Commission (ILC), the United\r\nNations Environment Programme, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, to name only some. Meanwhile, the AALCC\r\nsends representatives to various meetings within the United\r\nNations system; they play an active part in deliberations on\r\nrelevant matters and make a positive contribution. Over the\r\nyears, the AALCC has always given priority to legal and\r\nother matters that are of concern to the United Nations. Its\r\ncooperation with the ILC stands out in this regard. The\r\nAALCC invites the members of the ILC to its annual\r\nmeeting to brief it on the work of the Commission, and also\r\nincludes the report of the ILC on its agenda as a perennial\r\nitem and puts forward proposals in that regard. On the other\r\nhand, the Secretary-General of the AALCC attends the\r\nannual meeting of the ILC and briefs its members on the\r\nwork of the Committee. Cooperation between those two\r\nbodies has been fruitful and satisfactory.\r\nLast April, the thirty-seventh annual session of the\r\nAALCC was convened at New Delhi; it considered in depth\r\nand in detail such important matters as the work of the ILC,\r\nthe establishment of an International Criminal Court, the\r\nUnited Nations Decade of International Law, the law of the\r\nsea, the protection of the environment, treaty reservations,\r\nrefugees, the extraterritorial applicability of domestic\r\nlaws, and international waterways. As a result, mutual\r\nunderstanding and cooperation among member States on\r\nthose matters has been enhanced.\r\nAs a member of the United Nations and of the\r\nAALCC, China is very pleased with the ever closer and\r\nexpanding cooperation between the two organizations. We\r\nhope that the two organizations will further enhance their\r\ncooperation in the field of the progressive development\r\nand codification of international law and in other fields of\r\ncommon concern, and that this will serve as a model for\r\nthe development of close ties and cooperation between\r\ninternational and regional organizations for the\r\nachievement of world peace and development.\r\nIn the light of what I have said, the Chinese\r\ndelegation takes great pleasure in having joined other\r\nAsian and African countries in sponsoring draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.9, on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe AALCC.\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches great importance\r\nto the AALCC. Since becoming a full member of the\r\nAALCC in 1983, we have taken an active part in its work\r\nand have given it all possible support. We will continue\r\nto contribute to the further strengthening of the role and\r\ninfluence of the AALCC and to closer cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Committee.\r\nMs. Syahruddin (Indonesia): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report contained in document\r\nA/53/306.\r\nIt is fitting to recall that more than four decades ago,\r\nas an outcome of the Bandung Conference, the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee (AALCC)\r\nemerged, embracing the two sister continents of Asia and\r\nAfrica and gradually establishing itself as a major forum\r\nfor international cooperation. Without a doubt, that\r\nhistoric conference has few parallels, in terms of history,\r\nin terms of the vastness of the areas it represented or in\r\nterms of the lofty objectives it aimed to achieve. It had a\r\nmomentous impact on forging an identity between groups\r\nof nations with different political, economic and social\r\nstructures, and in its dynamism became an independent\r\nforce in international affairs. In this regard, Indonesia\r\ntakes great pride in having been one of the seven\r\nfounding States to have sponsored the AALCC at\r\nBandung in 1955.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nIn its work, the AALCC has long oriented its activities\r\nto complement the work of the United Nations, and has\r\nestablished close relations with the Organization and its\r\nvarious agencies engaged in activities in the field of law\r\nand in economic relations. This culminated in the decision\r\nof the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session to accord\r\npermanent observer status to the AALCC, a distinction that\r\nit shares with few other international organizations.\r\nFollowing close consultations between officials of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Secretary-General of the AALCC,\r\na programme of cooperation was drawn up and remains a\r\nregular feature to this day. In this regard, the AALCC has\r\nundertaken important initiatives with a view to\r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations. The report of\r\nthe Secretary-General has focused our attention on such\r\nactivities. What is noteworthy is that these areas are not\r\nconfined to the membership of the AALCC, but also\r\ninvolve interested States Members of the United Nations.\r\nFurthermore, areas of cooperation have been expanded to\r\ncover issues of economic cooperation, the environment and\r\nrefugees, in addition to work in the field of the progressive\r\ncodification of international law.\r\nWe appreciate the degree and extent of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the AALCC. The AALCC\r\ncontinues to be represented at various meetings and\r\nconferences held under the auspices of the United Nations,\r\nincluding the sessions of the General Assembly, the United\r\nNations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the\r\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court, and the\r\nsessions of the International Law Commission (ILC), the\r\nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law\r\n(UNCITRAL) and the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme (UNEP).\r\nWhen the General Assembly declared the period\r\n1990-1999 as the United Nations Decade of International\r\nLaw, it was clear from the outset that the AALCC, as a\r\nunique regional organization, would play an important role\r\nin the attainment and realization of the objectives set out\r\nfor the Decade. Indonesia, for its part, considers the United\r\nNations Decade of International Law to be of great\r\nimportance to developing countries in particular, and it\r\nearnestly hopes that as we near the end of this period, the\r\nparticipation of the AALCC in activities such as training in\r\ninternational law, the holding of seminars and the\r\nintensification of cooperation between United Nations\r\nbodies and the AALCC will be further enhanced.\r\nThe work of the Sixth Committee is of special interest\r\nto the AALCC, and the latter prepares notes and comments\r\non items under consideration in order to assist Member\r\nStates in their participation. Such assistance contributes to\r\na more fruitful outcome of those deliberations. Of\r\nparticular relevance is the AALCC’s close links with the\r\nInternational Law Commission (ILC) and the United\r\nNations Commission on International Trade Law\r\n(UNCITRAL). With regard to the ILC, it was at the\r\nbehest of the AALCC that the agenda items entitled\r\n“Diplomatic Protection” and the initiation of a feasibility\r\nstudy on the “Law of environment” were thereafter taken\r\ninto consideration. During the period under review, the\r\ncooperation between the AALCC and UNCITRAL\r\ncontinues to be close, as AALCC submitted notes and\r\ncomments on the items on the agenda of UNCITRAL at\r\nits last two sessions.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation is confident that such\r\nclose links will foster trade at the interregional as well as\r\nthe global levels. The participation of the two bodies has\r\nalso contributed towards the development and codification\r\nof legal norms of international trade law that would\r\nreflect the interests of the developing countries.\r\nIndonesia has always attached paramount importance\r\nto the subject of the law of the sea. It should be recalled\r\nthat it was at the request of Indonesia that this item was\r\nincluded in the agenda of the AALCC in 1971. We are\r\ntherefore most gratified by the endeavours of the AALCC\r\nto promote the ratification and implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nFurthermore, the advice of the AALCC to Member States\r\nto fully participate in the International Seabed Authority\r\nis to be welcomed, as this would ensure that the\r\nlegitimate interests of the developing nations are\r\nsafeguarded. Concurrently, it has worked towards\r\nstrengthening the principle of the common heritage of\r\nmankind. The efforts of the AALCC, through its notes\r\nand comments on the item “Oceans and law of the sea”,\r\noffer valuable guidance to Member States in preparing for\r\nits discussion in the General Assembly.\r\nAlthough the role of the AALCC was initially in the\r\nfield of international law, it has broadened its objectives\r\nto provide a forum for international economic cooperation\r\nfor development. In this regard, the report of the\r\nSecretary-General aptly alludes to the activities\r\nundertaken in this field. One of the issues that it has\r\nrecently addressed concerns the legal issues arising out of\r\nthe privatization of public sector undertakings and the\r\nliberalization of economic activities as a means of\r\nincreasing economic efficiency. We remain fully\r\nconfident that the AALCC will continue its endeavours\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\ntowards promoting economic cooperation within an\r\nappropriate framework which could blend economic and\r\nlegal aspects, in which cooperation as an effective\r\ninstrument can contribute to lasting growth.\r\nIn a global environment where flashpoints of unrest\r\npersist throughout the world, the refugee issue remains an\r\noutstanding and unresolved problem. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation is encouraged by the cooperation existing\r\nbetween the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the AALCC,\r\nand the ongoing efforts in the area of refugee law and\r\nrefugee problems. With the assistance of the UNHCR, a\r\nseminar was held to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary\r\nof the principles adopted at Bangkok by the AALCC\r\nconcerning the treatment of refugees. We look forward with\r\ninterest to the consideration of the proposal of the meeting\r\nof experts convened in Tehran.\r\nIt is important to note the other issues before the\r\nAALCC, namely, the environment, migrant workers and the\r\nitem entitled “Extraterritorial application of national\r\nlegislation: sanctions imposed against third parties”.\r\nIndonesia, for its part, is pleased to support the activities of\r\nthe AALCC and remains confident that such worthy efforts\r\nwill continue to strengthen the AALCC’s contributions to\r\nthe Organization and to the international community.\r\nIn conclusion, Indonesia, as a founding member of the\r\nAALCC, is pleased to co-sponsor the draft resolution before\r\nus entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee”, as\r\ncontained in document A/53/L.9.\r\nMr. Gaa (Philippines): I should like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the agenda item before\r\nus. The report is a very useful gauge not only of the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee, but also of the\r\nachievements of the Committee.\r\nWhen the Committee was formed over four decades\r\nago, the major challenge that faced it was how to play a\r\nmajor role in one of the most fundamental global\r\ntransformations in history — a transformation that changed\r\nthe complexion of the international community. During the\r\ntime when the newly independent States of Asia and Africa\r\nbegan emerging from colonial rule, the Committee proved\r\nto be a critical and invaluable player in creating a wider\r\nappreciation of international legal issues among its\r\nmembers by serving as a forum for consultation and\r\ncooperation on legal issues between Asian and African\r\nStates. During that critical time and even after, the\r\nCommittee contributed to the formulation and progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law by taking into account\r\nthe political and economic needs of those developing\r\ncountries.\r\nI join other speakers in noting the many specific\r\ninstances in which the Committee contributed to the\r\nformation and progressive development of international\r\nlaw.\r\nToday, as we stand on the doorstep of a new\r\nmillennium, another fundamental global transformation is\r\nfacing the Committee: the challenge of globalization. It is\r\na challenge that the Committee, with its decades of\r\nexperience and with an understanding of the needs of its\r\nmembers, is all too ready to face. As the Committee has\r\nalready shown success in formulating common approaches\r\nto complex international legal issues, the Philippines is\r\nconfident that it will be able to face this new challenge.\r\nThe Committee will be conducting its work against\r\na backdrop of complex and profound international events\r\nand transformations. Those events have brought welcome\r\nchanges, but these have been eclipsed by the problems\r\nand difficulties that have forced all of us to call into\r\nquestion some of the traditional and familiar ways in\r\nwhich we have been addressing the challenges facing us.\r\nWhereas once we dwelled in a bipolar and deeply\r\ndivided world, today we find ours a seamless globalized\r\nworld. It is a world where the interaction among States\r\nhas intensified, and this interaction has come in many\r\nforms. While the globalized world has meant progress for\r\nmany, this increased interaction can also mean a possible\r\nincrease in the potential for misunderstanding. Here the\r\nCommittee has already proved its worth. Much of its\r\nwork in the progressive development of international law\r\nhas been in the area of the formulation of norms,\r\nparticularly in the areas of economic cooperation, the\r\nenvironment and global resources, that will help States\r\ninteract with each other in a dynamic but orderly manner.\r\nIn addition, the Committee has achieved much in the area\r\nof dispute resolution, particularly focusing on the\r\nincreasing role of the International Court of Justice, as\r\nwell as on other dispute-settlement mechanisms, such as\r\narbitration.\r\nThe United Nations has itself sought to adjust to\r\nface challenges of today’s globalized world. The\r\nCommittee can ensure its active participation in dealing\r\nwith these challenges by continuing to orient its activities\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nto complement the work of the United Nations and by\r\nstrengthening its close relations with the United Nations and\r\nits various agencies engaged in law and economic matters.\r\nRealizing early on that the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization should be addressed multilaterally, the United\r\nNations has sought the cooperation of other multilateral\r\norganizations to strengthen normative, legal and institutional\r\nframeworks in the hope that the global economy can be\r\nmanaged more effectively and, perhaps more importantly,\r\nmore equitably. In this regard, the Committee, with its vast\r\nexperience of successfully challenging and changing the\r\npost-colonial landscape, should prove invaluable.\r\nAs a member of the Committee and of this\r\nOrganization, the Philippines renews its pledge to work\r\ntowards establishing a global order in which peace prevails\r\nand nations live in harmony and security and with their\r\nsovereignty respected; an order in which growth and\r\ndevelopment are rights and not privileges; a world of justice\r\nand equality where the individual and his or her rights are\r\nrespected; a world that protects the earth and that grows\r\nand develops only in a manner that will sustain the natural\r\nenvironment.\r\nMr. Wilmot (Ghana): My delegation is happy to\r\nobserve that since the General Assembly, in its resolution\r\n35/2 of October 1980, invited the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Committee (AALCC) to participate in its\r\nsessions in the capacity of observer, since the subsequent\r\nestablishment of the AALCC permanent observer missions\r\nto the United Nations in New York and Vienna, and\r\nparticularly following General Assembly resolution 51/11\r\nof 4 November 1996, entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee”, there has been a significant widening of the\r\nscope of cooperation between the two bodies.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General in document\r\nA/53/306 on the item before us gives a succinct account of\r\nthe various activities undertaken by the AALCC within the\r\ncooperation framework. It is clear from this account that the\r\nwork programme of the Consultative Committee is very\r\nsupportive of the agenda of the United Nations and focuses\r\nsubstantially on matters of current interest to the\r\nOrganization. Thus, the AALCC no longer confines itself\r\nto the field of international law but now covers as well\r\nmatters in the economic, environmental and humanitarian\r\nfields.\r\nIn the economic field, for example, we note with\r\nappreciation the AALCC’s work programme on\r\ninternational economic cooperation for development,\r\nparticularly as it relates to the development of\r\ninternational trade law, the dispute mechanism of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization and the regulatory framework\r\nfor the privatization of public sector undertakings and\r\nother liberalization measures within the context of\r\neconomic reforms.\r\nEqually worthy of note is the Consultative\r\nCommittee’s work in the humanitarian field, particularly\r\nits close involvement in the study of refugee law and\r\nrefugee problems in cooperation with the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees.\r\nAs regards the environment, the AALCC has taken\r\ninitiatives in prodding the International Law Commission\r\nto undertake a feasibility study on “Law of Environment”.\r\nDeveloping countries owe the AALCC a debt of\r\ngratitude for the various measures it has taken for the\r\npromotion of the ratification and implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The\r\nCommittee has consistently urged the full and effective\r\nparticipation of its member States in the International\r\nSeabed Authority so as to ensure and safeguard the\r\nlegitimate interests of developing countries and to\r\nstrengthen the principle of the common heritage of\r\nmankind. We join the Consultative Committee in calling\r\nupon developing countries to give timely consideration to\r\nthe need to adopt a common policy and strategy for the\r\ninterim period before the commercial exploitation of deep\r\nseabed minerals becomes feasible.\r\nWe are also grateful to the AALCC secretariat for\r\nfacilitating the General Assembly’s discussion on the\r\nagenda item “Oceans and the law of the sea” by preparing\r\nnotes and comments for use by representatives of its\r\nmember States. In this connection, we commend the\r\nCommittee for its invaluable assistance designed to\r\nfurther the work of the Sixth Committee of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe AALCC, in pursuance of the cooperation\r\nprogramme, participates in many meetings and\r\nconferences held under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. In this regard, my delegation is particularly\r\npleased about the Consultative Committee’s participation\r\nin the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of\r\nPlenipotentiaries in Rome in June and July 1998, which\r\nculminated in the adoption of the Statute for the\r\nestablishment of an International Criminal Court. We\r\nwelcome this development in our collective endeavour to\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nprovide a legal and constitutional framework to hold\r\nperpetrators accountable for genocide, crimes against\r\nhumanity, war crimes and serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law. It is pertinent to recall in this regard that\r\nthe AALCC’s initiatives on the interrelated aspects of\r\ninternational humanitarian law and the International\r\nCriminal Court contributed significantly to the legal regime\r\nof the Court.\r\nWe also note with appreciation the Consultative\r\nCommittee’s invaluable contribution to the implementation\r\nof the programme of the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law and to the work of the International Law\r\nCommission. Equally worthy of note is the Committee’s\r\npromotion of the wider use of the International Court of\r\nJustice, particularly in matters relating to the protection and\r\npreservation of the environment.\r\nLastly, we commend the AALCC for its active\r\nparticipation in the current reform process geared to the\r\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations, including\r\nimprovements in the functioning of the General Assembly.\r\nWe encourage the Committee to continue with its work in\r\nthis regard.\r\nConcerning other issues before the Consultative\r\nCommittee, we note with interest its ongoing work on\r\ninternational instruments adopted by some of the recent\r\nUnited Nations international conferences and its study of\r\nthe topical issue of national legislation with extraterritorial\r\napplication. We look forward with great interest to the final\r\nconclusions of this study in view of the strong passions the\r\nsubject has evoked in the United Nations.\r\nIt is clear from the report of the Secretary-General that\r\nthe cooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Committee has proved very\r\nbeneficial to the two organizations and therefore should be\r\ngiven every encouragement and support so as to strengthen\r\nit further. It is our hope that the debate on this item will\r\nterminate in a renewed resolve of all Member States of this\r\nOrganization to extend such encouragement and support.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to be a sponsor of draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.9, entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee”.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): In\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 35/2 of 13\r\nOctober 1980, I now call on the Secretary-General of the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Committee, Mr. Tang\r\nChengyuan.\r\nMr. Tang (Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nCommittee): Allow me, on behalf of the Asian-African\r\nLegal Consultative Committee (AALCC) to extend to\r\nyou, Sir, our congratulations on your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We\r\nwould also like to congratulate the members of your\r\nBureau. We are confident that under your able and adroit\r\nstewardship the Assembly will give due consideration to\r\nthe many items on its agenda and make this session a\r\nmomentous success.\r\nIt is with gratitude that I report to the Assembly on\r\nthe state of the close cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the AALCC. May I recall that a similar\r\nhonour and privilege was afforded at the fifty-first\r\nsession, and that the General Assembly on that occasion\r\nrequested the United Nations Secretary-General to submit,\r\nat its fifty-third session, a report on the cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations. That report is now before\r\nthe General Assembly in document A/53/306. I would\r\nlike to congratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan for this\r\ncomprehensive report and to commend it to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe AALCC, which began with a modest\r\nmembership of seven States when it was constituted in\r\nNovember 1956, today has 44 members embracing the\r\nAfrican and Asian region. It has established itself as a\r\nmajor forum for international cooperation, and its work\r\nprogramme has accordingly been suitably oriented to meet\r\nchallenges posed by contemporary international society in\r\ngeneral and the needs of an expanding membership\r\nembracing the two continents of Asia and Africa in\r\nparticular.\r\nLast year witnessed the opening of a new chapter in\r\nthe history of the Committee, when a special session of\r\nthe Committee decided that its permanent headquarters\r\nwould be in New Delhi. That momentous decision was\r\nmade feasible by the generous offer of the Government of\r\nIndia and by the generous gesture of the Government of\r\nQatar.\r\nIn the years since the Committee was constituted,\r\nand in particular since it was accorded permanent\r\nobserver status in 1980, its work in support of the United\r\nNations has been predominantly aimed at rendering\r\nassistance to the AALCC member Governments in their\r\nconsideration of the agenda items before the Sixth\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nCommittee of the General Assembly. The secretariat has\r\nalso endeavoured to furnish assistance in the economic and\r\nhumanitarian fields through the preparation of briefs and\r\nstudies. This reflects the inclusion of certain items and\r\ntopics under consideration by the United Nations in the\r\nwork programme of the AALCC.\r\nYet another significant aspect of the AALCC’s work\r\nin support of the United Nations consists of the efforts\r\nmade to strengthen the United Nations by promoting the\r\nratification and implementation of major international\r\ninstruments and through such initiatives as the wider use of\r\nthe International Court of Justice for the peaceful settlement\r\nof disputes.\r\nFollowing the conclusion of a formal cooperation\r\nagreement with the United Nations in May 1987, periodic\r\nconsultations have taken place on matters of common\r\nconcern between successive Secretaries-General and other\r\nrelevant senior officers of the two organizations. The\r\nAALCC has also concluded formal cooperation agreements\r\nwith a number of United Nations bodies and specialized\r\nagencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\r\nUnited Nations, the International Maritime Organization, the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme, the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization and the United Nations Institute\r\nfor Training and Research. The AALCC also maintains\r\nclose links with other bodies and agencies, such as the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, the International Law\r\nCommission (ILC), the United Nations Commission on\r\nInternational Trade Law and the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees. The secretariat\r\nis negotiating a cooperation agreement with the World\r\nIntellectual Property Organization.\r\nMay I recall in this regard that during the 1960s the\r\nAALCC was among the first regional organizations to study\r\nthe matter of the legality of nuclear weapons. During the\r\n1970s, when the law of the sea and the question of a new\r\ninternational economic order were in the forefront, the\r\nAALCC made its contribution by being instrumental in\r\nevolving the concept of archipelagic States and exclusive\r\neconomic zones.\r\nEarlier in this decade, when the General Assembly\r\ndecided to convene a conference on environment and\r\ndevelopment, the AALCC secretariat involved itself as\r\nextensively as its resources permitted, with the preparatory\r\nphase of the United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development. The involvement of the AALCC with the\r\nUnited Nations Decade of International Law is too well\r\nknown to need recounting before this Assembly.\r\nMore recently, following the adoption by the ILC of\r\na draft statute for an international criminal court, in the\r\nGeneral Assembly the AALCC was actively involved in\r\nthe process culminating in the convening of a United\r\nNations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the\r\nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court. The\r\nsecretariat prepared an overview of the draft Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, prepared by the Preparatory\r\nCommittee, and was represented at the Conference in\r\nRome.\r\nThe AALCC has often been among the first regional\r\nbodies to study current legal developments of concern to\r\nthe developing countries. Last year, the AALCC was\r\namong the first to consider the item entitled\r\n“Extraterritorial application of national legislation:\r\nsanctions against third parties”. The item was considered\r\nat the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh sessions of the\r\nAALCC, held in Tehran in May 1997 and New Delhi in\r\nApril 1998, respectively. The matter was also discussed\r\nby a group of experts, which met in January 1998, and I\r\nreport with a degree of satisfaction that the secretariat of\r\nthe Committee has published the proceedings of that\r\nmeeting, together with the papers presented there.\r\nThe AALCC, in response to the call of the General\r\nAssembly, organized a special meeting on reservations to\r\ntreaties to consider the preliminary conclusions on the\r\nreservations to normative multilateral treaties, including\r\nhuman rights treaties. A report of that special meeting\r\nwas thereafter submitted to the Chairman of the\r\nInternational Law Commission during the course of its\r\nrecently concluded fiftieth session. Allow me to state in\r\nthis regard that we deeply cherish our ties of cooperation,\r\nboth with this body as well as with the International Law\r\nCommission.\r\nDuring the years since its establishment, the AALCC\r\nhas endeavoured to make its modest contribution to the\r\nattainment of the objectives and goals relevant to its\r\nsphere of competence. In the process, it has established a\r\nsymbiotic relationship with a number of organs and\r\nagencies of the United Nations. I should like, on behalf of\r\nthe AALCC, to extend our assurances that the Committee\r\nwill continue to support the work and activities of the\r\nUnited Nations bodies and to lend its cooperation towards\r\nthe prevalence of the rule of law in international relations.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nThe Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee is\r\nproud of its record of cooperative arrangements with the\r\nUnited Nations in our common endeavours. We shall\r\ncontinue to strive to fortify this cooperation and to\r\nstrengthen the international legal order. We firmly believe\r\nthat the international legal order must affirm such principles\r\nand norms of inter-State relations as the sovereign equality\r\nof States; non-interference in the internal affairs of other\r\nStates; the non-use of force; the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes; pacta sunt servanda; respect for human rights; the\r\nright to development; the protection and preservation of the\r\nenvironment of the global commons; and the principle of\r\nthe common heritage of mankind.\r\nFinally, permit me to state that a report on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the AALCC, the resolution\r\nof this body on the subject and my statement before this\r\nbody will be placed before the AALCC at its thirty-eighth\r\nsession, scheduled to be held in Accra, Ghana, from 29\r\nMarch to 2 April 1999. Permit me to take this opportunity\r\nto extend to all a cordial invitation to participate in that\r\nsession of the AALCC.\r\nI thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor and\r\nI also thank representatives here for the patient hearing that\r\nthey have given me.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI am pleased to announce that, since the introduction\r\nof draft resolution A/53/L.9, the following countries have\r\nbecome cosponsors: Australia, Cyprus, Malaysia and New\r\nZealand.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.9.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.9 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/14).\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): May I\r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 22?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 34\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/435)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.14)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Kazakhstan to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.14.\r\nMrs. Arystanbekova (Kazakhstan): As a\r\nrepresentative of the State which has held the\r\nchairmanship of the Economic Cooperation Organization\r\n(ECO) since May this year, I consider it a great honour\r\nto be addressing the General Assembly on the agenda\r\nitem entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Economic Cooperation Organization” on behalf of\r\nthe 10 States members of ECO. I should also like, on\r\ntheir behalf, to express our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the detailed report, contained in document\r\nA/53/435, prepared on the subject under discussion. In\r\nour view, this document demonstrates clearly and\r\nsufficiently fully the increased volume and main areas of\r\ncooperation between the two organizations and defines the\r\nprospects for its expansion and intensification.\r\nThe ECO member countries attach great importance\r\nto the development of regional cooperation. In our view,\r\nthe trend currently under way in the world to strengthen\r\nand expand regional cooperation is an integral part of the\r\noverall process of globalization and creates both the\r\nnecessary conditions for the increased well-being of the\r\npopulations of the countries of the region and the\r\nprerequisites for the progressive development of the world\r\neconomy as a whole.\r\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies,\r\nprogrammes and funds can play and are playing an\r\nimportant and often universal role in promoting the\r\ndevelopment of regional and interregional cooperation.\r\nThe United Nations makes a major contribution to\r\ndefining promising spheres and potentials for the\r\ndevelopment of regional and interregional cooperation,\r\nand also in creating the necessary conditions for making\r\nit more active. In this respect, the work of the regional\r\ncommissions of the United Nations, including the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP) and the Economic Commission for\r\nEurope (ECE), which are actively promoting cooperation\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nbetween the main subregional organizations in the Asia and\r\nPacific and European regions, deserves to be particularly\r\nsingled out.\r\nAs is indicated in the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nactive cooperation between ECO and ESCAP started in\r\n1993 with the signature of a memorandum of understanding\r\nbased on the Treaty of Izmir and the terms of reference of\r\nESCAP. Currently, a project is being implemented in\r\nESCAP to strengthen subregional economic cooperation in\r\ntrade and investment among the south-western States\r\nmembers of the Commission, aimed at assisting ECO\r\ncountries in exploiting new trade and investment\r\nopportunities provided by the progressive development of\r\ninfrastructure in the ECO region. The prospects for\r\nintensifying technical cooperation between ECO and\r\nESCAP are also being studied in relation to the\r\ndevelopment of a subregional database on trade and\r\ninvestment, strengthening of inter-subregional financial\r\nlinkages, institution- and capacity-building and\r\nstrengthening the potential of the organization, and also in\r\nrelation to trade policy.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the work of ESCAP and the\r\nECE on the development of the United Nations special\r\nprogramme for the four Central Asian countries that are\r\nmembers of ECO, the aim of which is to assist the States\r\nof the region in developing and intensifying their mutual\r\ncooperation, promoting economic growth and achieving\r\neffective integration into the world economy. The\r\nDeclaration on the special programme for the economies of\r\nCentral Asia, signed in March this year, also defines\r\nspheres of cooperation that are vitally important for the\r\ncountries of the region, such as the development of\r\ntransport infrastructure, rational and effective use of Central\r\nAsia’s energy and water resources and cooperation in\r\nrelation to the development of ways of delivering\r\nhydrocarbons to world markets.\r\nIn view of the priority significance of reliable and\r\neffective functioning of ground transport and the\r\nestablishment of an appropriate transport infrastructure for\r\nthe economic integration of the ECO countries, seven of\r\nwhich are landlocked, one of the priorities for our region\r\nremains cooperation between ECO, ESCAP and the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development in the\r\ndevelopment of the transport sector. An important and\r\nconstructive role in providing assistance in solving this\r\nproblem, as well as in other spheres, including increasing\r\ntrade efficiency, the development of data processing and\r\nstrengthening of the potential of the ECO secretariat, is\r\nplayed by the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP). Since 1997 UNDP has been providing financial\r\nsupport for a joint ECO/UNDP project to grant assistance\r\nto the ECO member countries in increasing trade\r\nefficiency and developing economic cooperation.\r\nConvincing evidence of the progressive movement\r\ntowards expansion and intensification of cooperation\r\nbetween ECO and UNDP was the signing in New York\r\nat the beginning of this month of a project on technical\r\nand financial assistance from UNDP to increase the\r\neffectiveness of the work of the ECO secretariat. This\r\nproject provides for comprehensive assistance by UNDP\r\nto the process of training and advanced training of the\r\nstaff of the ECO secretariat, and also for assistance in\r\nproviding it with technical equipment.\r\nWe express our satisfaction at the progressive\r\ndevelopment of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nsystem and ECO, and we call on the relevant specialized\r\nagencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations to\r\nfurther expand and intensify their cooperation with the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization in various areas of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization, which\r\nbrings together 10 States with a total population of more\r\nthan 300 million people, is a promising and dynamically\r\ndeveloping organization. It possesses considerable\r\npotential both for the expansion of trade and economic,\r\nhumanitarian and cultural links in our region and for the\r\ndevelopment of interregional communication. The\r\nDeclaration and other documents adopted at the most\r\nrecent ECO summit — the fifth summit — in Almaty in\r\nMay this year create good conditions for the further\r\nintensification of cooperation and the establishment of a\r\nfavourable trade and investment climate in our region, in\r\nwhich both the member countries of the organization and\r\nmany States of Europe and Asia are equally interested.\r\nWe wish to note with satisfaction that over the period that\r\nhas elapsed since the establishment of ECO, the States\r\nmembers of the organization have achieved significant\r\nprogress in such important spheres of activity as trade, the\r\ndevelopment of communications, of ground, sea and air\r\ntransport systems and of a network of oil and gas\r\npipelines and also in the spheres of energy supply and\r\ninformation exchange. Fuller and more effective\r\nutilization of the existing potential of ECO will certainly\r\nbe beneficial both to the countries located in our region\r\nand to the States located outside it.\r\nOn behalf of the States members of ECO, I submit\r\nfor consideration by the General Assembly draft\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nresolution A/53/L.14, on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Economic Cooperation Organization. The\r\ndraft notes the level of cooperation achieved between the\r\ntwo Organizations and contains provisions aimed at further\r\ndeveloping and intensifying the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and ECO. In the course of consultations on\r\nthe draft resolution we sought to take into account all the\r\ncomments and proposals received from the delegations of\r\ninterested countries.\r\nThe sponsors of the draft resolution call on the\r\ndelegations of States Members of the United Nations to\r\nadopt by consensus draft resolution A/53/L.14, on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization, submitted under agenda item 34.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran): At\r\nthe outset, let me thank the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations for his report on the issue of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO) and also extend my sincere\r\nappreciation to Mr. Onder Ozar, Secretary-General of the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization, and his colleagues for\r\ntheir endeavours to strengthen the secretariat of ECO and\r\nto expand cooperation with regional, multilateral and\r\ninternational bodies and organizations, in particular the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nThe process of globalization seems to be an\r\nundeniable fact of our collective life today, and for the past\r\ndecade or so it has made itself felt to different degrees, in\r\ndifferent forms and in different arenas of the national life\r\nof societies. We are all cognizant of the fact that powerful\r\ntransnational forces are at work reshaping the key features\r\nof world markets in capital, goods, services, labour and\r\ntechnology. Likewise, we are aware that the twin process of\r\nglobalization and liberalization have expanded and\r\ndeepened the mutual interdependence of societies, which\r\nhave, in turn, increased the potential for international\r\ninteraction and cooperation.\r\nIn such a global environment, the real world is\r\nperceived as increasingly borderless, and the creation of\r\nregional economic groupings is a real approach by\r\ndeveloping countries to integrate themselves smoothly into\r\nthe world economy. In fact, by lowering tariff and other\r\ntrade barriers and by eliminating impediments to capital\r\nflows in the regional grouping arrangements, developing\r\ncountries prepare themselves and establish necessary\r\ncapacities for integration into the world economy and for\r\naddressing existing and future global challenges.\r\nThe main objectives of the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO), which was established in 1985 and\r\nwhose current membership numbers 10 countries, are\r\nremoval of trade barriers within the ECO region,\r\nexpansion of intraregional and interregional trade and\r\nensuring the gradual and smooth integration of the\r\neconomies of ECO member States into the world\r\neconomy and their participation in the globalization\r\nprocess. The situation of ECO member States and their\r\nexisting domestic socio-economic conditions necessitate\r\nthe extension of cooperation for utilizing their potential\r\nand for realizing opportunities with all international and\r\nmultilateral bodies, in particular the United Nations\r\nsystem. At the very centre of the region’s potential are its\r\noil and gas reserves and rich mineral resources, which\r\nprovide all the ingredients for a sound industrial base.\r\nThe region also has considerable agricultural potential,\r\nwith its vast lands accommodating both livestock and\r\ngrain production. Economic, social and environmental\r\nchallenges in the region are also enormous. All new\r\nmembers of ECO are at the stage of transition from\r\ncentral planning to market-oriented economies. Since\r\nthese States are also landlocked countries, strengthening\r\nthe transit infrastructure at the regional level is an urgent\r\nneed for the expansion of trade, increasing investment\r\nopportunities and their integration into the world\r\neconomy. Protection of the environment, in particular in\r\nthe Caspian Sea, Aral Sea and some other regions in\r\nCentral Asia, is among the major challenges before\r\nlittoral States and concerned countries in the Organization.\r\nThe region also continues to be one of the regions most\r\nvulnerable to the illicit cultivation and production,\r\ntrafficking and consumption of narcotic drugs.\r\nWe firmly believe that the United Nations system, as\r\na multidimensional mechanism, should play an effective\r\nrole in the process of strengthening ECO so that it can be\r\na more prosperous and functional regional organization.\r\nThe United Nations funds and programmes and the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific have increased their consultations and cooperation\r\nwith ECO and its associated bodies to assist its member\r\nStates in capacity-building to enable them to address these\r\nchallenges. The United Nations Development Programme\r\nhas also contributed to the capacity-building of the ECO\r\nsecretariat, as well as to trade efficiency, economic\r\ncooperation and resource complementarities among ECO\r\nmember States through bilateral and trilateral cooperation\r\nmechanisms. The cooperation between the Economic and\r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific and ECO is\r\nquite extensive, particularly in sharing analytical and\r\ntechnical information and ideas, expanding relations\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\namong their subsidiary bodies in various fields and\r\ncollaboration on the issues of transit and transportation and\r\nother related matters. Other United Nations funds and\r\nprogrammes have also been engaged in cooperation and\r\nconsultation in areas such as population, food security,\r\nagricultural and industrial development and controlling\r\nnarcotic drugs.\r\nDespite these admirable endeavours, the demands for\r\npromoting such cooperation at the regional level are high.\r\nThe restructuring of the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization requires the assistance of the specialized\r\nagencies and other organizations and programmes of the\r\nUnited Nations system and of the relevant international\r\nfinancial institutions. These contributions should be geared\r\ntowards promoting the socio-economic infrastructure of the\r\nmember States of ECO. The opportunities for cooperation\r\nin the fields of trade, investment, energy, environment,\r\nindustry and agriculture are undeniably vast and need no\r\nfurther elaboration.\r\nThe major challenge for economic prosperity and\r\nsustainable development in the region is outside pressure\r\nfor reshaping the rational economic relations among\r\nregional countries and their commercial relations with the\r\nrest of the world. Viable and feasible routes for export of\r\noil and raw materials have been halted by outside pressure.\r\nAn inevitable result of this would be expensive substitute\r\nroutes with adverse environmental effects. These policies\r\nadversely affect regional cooperation and will\r\nhinder the efforts of countries of the region for expeditious\r\nintegration into the world economy.\r\nI cannot conclude without referring to the menace of\r\nillicit cultivation and trafficking of narcotic drugs in the\r\nregion. We are of the view that intensive regional\r\ncooperation to combat this hazardous problem is vital for\r\nsocio-economic advancement and human development in\r\nthe region. The establishment of a Drug Control Unit in the\r\nECO is a positive step towards the realization of this\r\nobjective. In this context, cooperation between ECO, the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme and\r\nother intergovernmental and international organizations,\r\nespecially in supporting transit States in their efforts to halt\r\nthe inflow and trafficking of illicit drugs to consuming\r\ncountries, is imperative. Moreover, the role of the\r\nrespective bodies of the United Nations in helping States\r\naddress socio-economic and human development challenges\r\nresulting from the drug menace in the region should be\r\nstrengthened.\r\nAllow me to close by expressing our wish for the\r\nadoption of the draft resolution entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization” by a unanimous decision of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker on the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.14.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.14 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/15).\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): May\r\nI take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 34?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 26\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/430)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.13)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Qatar to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.13.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe State of Qatar, as current Chairman of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), has the\r\nhonour and privilege of introducing the draft resolution\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference”, contained in\r\ndocument A/53/L.13 of 27 October 1998, on behalf of the\r\n56 States members and six observers of the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference.\r\nAt the very outset, we would like to convey our\r\ndeep appreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report, contained in document A/53/430,\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nsubmitted pursuant to paragraph 12 of General Assembly\r\nresolution 52/4 of 22 October 1997.\r\nOn 1 October 1998, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, addressed the annual coordination meeting of\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of the States members of the\r\nOIC, held at United Nations Headquarters. At the\r\ncoordination meeting, it was unanimously agreed to admit\r\nGuyana as the fifty-sixth State member of the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference and to permit Thailand to\r\nparticipate as an observer. The ministers also reviewed the\r\ninternational situation, with particular attention to the\r\nsituation in the Middle East and the question of Palestine;\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina; Jammu and Kashmir; Afghanistan;\r\nSomalia; the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan; the\r\nconsequences of Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait; and the\r\nsituation pertaining to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 731 (1992) and 883 (1993). In\r\naddition, the ministers discussed the question of United\r\nNations reform.\r\nFurthermore, the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations attended the Eighth Summit of the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference, which was held at Tehran, Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, from 9 to 11 December 1997. During the\r\nSummit, the Secretary-General conferred with a number of\r\nheads of delegation and other senior participants in the\r\nSummit, including the OIC Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Azeddine Laraki, as well as the new Chairman of the\r\nOIC, President Seyed Mohammad Khatami of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran.\r\nAt the twenty-fifth meeting of Foreign Ministers of the\r\nOIC, which was convened at Doha in the State of Qatar\r\nfrom 15 to 19 March 1998, the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations was represented by his Special Envoy for\r\nAfghanistan, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference is\r\nsatisfied at its active participation in the work of the United\r\nNations with the aim of implementing the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter. It is gratified by the close\r\ncooperation between the two organizations during the\r\nperiod since the adoption of resolution 52/4 of 22 October\r\n1997. Over the past year there have been many cases of the\r\ntwo organizations undertaking joint, mutually reinforcing\r\nefforts. A new political dimension has been added to the\r\nconsultations on political issues of interest to both\r\norganizations, including cooperation with a view to settling\r\nthe dispute in Afghanistan. This demonstrates the great\r\npotential of concrete joint cooperation between the two\r\norganizations in the field of peacemaking.\r\nIn fact, since its establishment, the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference has been firmly committed to the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\nThere has been a great expansion in the scope of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, especially in the\r\npolitical, social and economic, humanitarian, cultural and\r\ntechnical fields. The two organizations are jointly seeking\r\nsolutions to global problems relating to international\r\npeace and security, disarmament, decolonization, the right\r\nof self-determination, human rights and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Islamic group hopes that the Permanent\r\nObserver Mission of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference to the United Nations will be granted\r\ndiplomatic status by the host country, in accordance with\r\nArticle 105 of the Charter and with the Headquarters\r\nAgreement concluded with the host country, because the\r\nMission represents an international organization that the\r\nGeneral Assembly has invited to participate in its sessions\r\nwith observer status. This would facilitate its work in a\r\nmanner similar to that which obtains in Geneva. This\r\nstatus would undoubtedly contribute to furthering the\r\nwork of the Mission, and would enable it to achieve what\r\nis expected of it in the service of the joint endeavours of\r\nthe two organizations and their subsidiary bodies.\r\nI turn now to draft resolution A/53/L.13 which I\r\nhave the honour to introduce. It describes not only the\r\nmultifaceted, concrete cooperation between the two\r\norganizations. It also calls for continued close\r\ncooperation. The substance of the draft resolution is\r\nidentical to that of texts adopted on this agenda item at\r\nprevious sessions.\r\nThe preambular part of the draft resolution takes into\r\naccount the desire of both organizations to continue their\r\ncommon search for solutions to global problems. It also\r\nrecalls Articles of the Charter of the United Nations that\r\nencourage the activities through regional cooperation for\r\nthe promotion of the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations. The preamble also notes the strengthening\r\nof cooperation between the United Nations, its funds and\r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and its specialized\r\nand affiliated institutions. It further notes the encouraging\r\nprogress made in the 10 priority areas of cooperation, as\r\nwell as in the identification of other areas of cooperation.\r\nIt also expresses the conviction that the strengthening of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and other\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\norganizations of the United Nations system and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and its organs and\r\ninstitutions contributes to the promotion of the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nMoreover, it notes with appreciation the determination\r\nof both organizations to strengthen further the existing\r\ncooperation by developing specific proposals in the\r\ndesignated priority areas of cooperation, as well as in the\r\npolitical field. The OIC welcomes the results of the general\r\nmeeting of the organizations and agencies of the United\r\nNations system and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and\r\naffiliated institutions, held at Geneva from 13 to 15 July\r\n1998.\r\nThe OIC also welcomes the high-level meeting,\r\nconvened by the Secretary-General on 28 and 29 July 1998,\r\nof regional organizations, including the OIC, with which the\r\nUnited Nations has cooperated in preventive diplomacy and\r\nthe establishment and maintenance of international peace.\r\nIn the operative paragraphs, the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference takes note with satisfaction of the report\r\nof the Secretary-General (A/53/430) of 24 September 1998,\r\nand takes note also of the conclusions and recommendations\r\nadopted by the general meeting of the secretariats and\r\nrepresentatives of the organizations and agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference and its specialized and affiliated institutions. It\r\nnotes with satisfaction the active participation of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations towards the realization of the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn addition, it calls on the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference to continue to\r\ncooperate in their common search for solutions to global\r\nproblems, such as questions relating to international peace\r\nand security, disarmament, self-determination,\r\ndecolonization, fundamental human rights, social and\r\neconomic development, and technical cooperation.\r\nMoreover, the General Assembly welcomes the efforts\r\nof the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference to strengthen cooperation between the two\r\norganizations in areas of common concern and to review\r\nthe ways and means for enhancing the mechanisms of such\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe General Assembly welcomes with appreciation the\r\nincreased cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference in the field of\r\npeacemaking and preventive diplomacy and takes note of\r\nthe effective cooperation between the two organizations\r\nin the search for a peaceful and lasting solution to the\r\nconflict in Afghanistan. It welcomes the efforts of the two\r\norganizations to strengthen information exchange,\r\ncoordination and cooperation between them in areas of\r\nmutual interest in the political field and their ongoing\r\nconsultations with a view to further developing the\r\nmechanisms of such cooperation.\r\nThe General Assembly also welcomes the periodic\r\nhigh-level meetings between the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, as well as\r\nbetween senior secretariat officials of the two\r\norganizations, and encourages their participation in\r\nimportant meetings of the two organizations. The General\r\nAssembly encourages the specialized agencies and other\r\norganizations of the United Nations system to continue to\r\nexpand their cooperation with the subsidiary organs and\r\nspecialized and affiliated institutions of the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference, particularly by negotiating\r\ncooperation agreements, and invites them to multiply the\r\ncontacts and meetings of the focal points for cooperation\r\nin priority areas of interest to the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nThe General Assembly urges the United Nations and\r\nother organizations of the United Nations system,\r\nespecially the lead agencies, to provide increased\r\ntechnical and other forms of assistance to the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary\r\norgans and specialized and affiliated institutions in order\r\nto enhance cooperation. It expresses its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen\r\ncooperation and coordination between the United Nations\r\nand other organizations of the United Nations system and\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and its\r\nsubsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated\r\ninstitutions to serve the mutual interests of the two\r\norganizations in the political, economic, social, cultural\r\nand humanitarian fields.\r\nThe draft resolution requests the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations to report to the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-fourth session on the state of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, and it notes that the General\r\nAssembly would include in the provisional agenda of its\r\nfifty-fourth session the item entitled “Cooperation\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference”.\r\nOn behalf of the member States of the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference and the observers, I wish to ask the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly to support the draft\r\nresolution and to facilitate its adoption by consensus, as has\r\nbeen the case in past years.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran): Let\r\nme first express my delegation’s appreciation and gratitude\r\nto the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his\r\nreport on “Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference”. The report reflects\r\nthe areas and issues of interest to both Organizations in the\r\npolitical, economic and cultural fields. A great deal has\r\nbeen achieved, but much remains to be done. The\r\nSecretary-General has touched upon a number of areas on\r\nwhich solid ground for cooperation has already been\r\nestablished.\r\nThe participation of the Secretary-General in the\r\nEighth Islamic Summit, held in Tehran in December 1997,\r\nwas regarded as a manifestation of the excellent\r\nrelationship and useful cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\n(OIC). In his address to the Islamic Summit, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral duly referred to this cooperation and eloquently\r\nemphasized that through the OIC,\r\n“the world understands the desires and demands of\r\nover one fifth of the world’s population, from all\r\ncontinents. That is why the partnership between the\r\nOIC and the United Nations is so important. That is\r\nwhy it holds such promise for all the peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations.” (SG/SM/6418, p. 2)\r\nWe are indeed pleased to note the remark of the\r\nSecretary-General in his report that\r\n“During the period under review, cooperation on\r\npolitical matters intensified between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, in particular with regard to ongoing\r\npeacemaking efforts.” (A/53/430, para. 7)\r\nThe close cooperation between the two organizations\r\nincludes cooperation on the peace process in Tajikistan, on\r\nvarious stages of the crisis in Afghanistan and on a number\r\nof other issues around the world.\r\nThe members of the OIC are firmly of the view that\r\neffective, constructive and meaningful participation of\r\nIslamic countries in the management of international\r\naffairs is essential for maintaining peace and security in\r\nthe world. Thus, they are determined to make positive\r\ncontributions to international peace and security and to\r\nsustainable growth and development. To this end, they\r\nhave, at various gatherings of the OIC, considered areas\r\nof interest and importance that require collective efforts.\r\nDecisions and resolutions were adopted at the Tehran\r\nSummit and at the twenty-fifth ministerial meeting in\r\nDoha, Qatar, last March on numerous issues, most of\r\nwhich appear also on the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Mangoaela (Lesotho), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nFurthermore, the Islamic countries have declared\r\ntheir strict adherence to cooperation for the protection and\r\npreservation of the environment, combating terrorism and\r\nillicit trafficking in drugs, as well as respect for\r\ninternational law in general and the United Nations\r\nCharter in particular. They have also expressed their\r\ndesire to cooperate with the United Nations on issues of\r\nsignificance, such as human rights and disarmament. The\r\nproposed meeting between the OIC and the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nwould further forge a spirit of cooperation and\r\nunderstanding on the important issue of human rights.\r\nChildren’s issues, as the Secretary-General says in\r\nhis report,\r\n“continue to retain high visibility on the political\r\nagenda in the Islamic world. This manifested itself\r\namply during the eighth OIC Summit at Tehran”.\r\n(A/53/430, para. 22)\r\nThe same Summit decided, among other things, to\r\nestablish an ad hoc committee to develop guidelines to\r\npromote dialogue, cooperation and confidence among its\r\nmember States. The first meeting of the committee, which\r\nwas held in Tehran last May, managed to produce a\r\ncomprehensive document which indeed is reflective of\r\ndifferent ways and means of promoting the dialogue,\r\ncooperation and confidence also cherished by the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nThe issues of common interest to the two\r\norganizations are by no means confined to what I have\r\nattempted to elaborate on here. There exist common\r\ndesires and aims in areas which need to be further\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\ndeveloped, and to this end new avenues for better\r\nunderstanding and strengthened cooperation in various\r\nfields should be explored. We are pleased to note that the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General is promising in its\r\nrecognition that there has been broad agreement on the\r\nvalue of regular political consultations between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nI wish to close by reaffirming the pledge of my\r\nGovernment, as current Chairman of the OIC, to gear our\r\nefforts towards the promotion and strengthening of the\r\ncooperation between the two organizations.\r\nMr. Vural (Turkey): Today is the seventy-fifth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic, and as\r\nI will be the host of the reception to which we will\r\nwelcome representatives in a few minutes, I would like to\r\nthank the representative of Pakistan for offering me his\r\nplace on the list of speakers.\r\nI will be very brief. I would like to welcome the\r\nreport presented by the Secretary-General to the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference. It gives evidence of a most welcome deepening\r\nof relations between the two organizations through high-\r\nlevel contacts, regular consultations and technical meetings.\r\nMy delegation supports this process and calls for its\r\ncontinuation.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)\r\ncovers a vast geographical area and an extensive population\r\ndispersed over four continents. It represents a rich diversity\r\nof cultures and political systems, taking as a common\r\ndenominator the heritage of Islam, which literally derives\r\nfrom the word “peace”. Through its members, the OIC has\r\na heritage of profound historical and political experience,\r\nwhich enables it to be an important instrument of peace and\r\nstability in the world.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations has proved to be an indispensable dimension\r\nof the international system. The Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference is one of these major regional organizations that\r\ncan contribute to and benefit from the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn view of all this, my delegation supports the draft\r\nresolution presented by the State of Qatar, which calls for\r\nthe enhancement of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the OIC. We hope that such cooperation will further\r\ncontribute to the global efforts for peace and international\r\nsolidarity.\r\nMs. Syahrudin (Indonesia): I should like to begin\r\nby expressing my delegation’s deep appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the lucid and comprehensive report\r\nhe has presented on the state of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), contained in document A/53/430. My\r\ndelegation would also like to acknowledge the important\r\ncontributions to the report made by the various entities of\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nIt is indeed a source of particular satisfaction to my\r\ndelegation to note the many important cooperative\r\nactivities that have taken place between the two\r\norganizations over the past year in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 52/4 of 22 October 1997,\r\nwhich Indonesia had the honour to introduce last year in\r\nits capacity as Chairman of the twenty-fourth meeting of\r\nForeign Ministers of the OIC.\r\nThe delegation of Indonesia welcomes the\r\nintensification of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the OIC in the political field and has noted the broad\r\nagreement that exists on the value of regular consultations\r\nbetween these two organizations. We are mindful of the\r\nimportant process of regular consultations between the\r\nsecretariats of the two organizations regarding the\r\nsituations in Somalia and Tajikistan. With regard to the\r\nconflict in Afghanistan, we have noted the significance of\r\nthe joint United Nations/OIC peacemaking mission to that\r\ncountry and the neighbouring countries earlier this year,\r\nas well as the subsequent series of meetings of the\r\nAfghan parties held under joint United Nations and OIC\r\nauspices. Indeed, we see merit in the observation by the\r\nco-chairmanship by the two organizations on the valuable\r\npotential of concrete joint cooperation in the field of\r\npeacemaking beyond the conflict in Afghanistan.\r\nIn the economic sphere, the imbalances and\r\ninequities of international economic relations continue to\r\nbear heavily on the OIC member countries, thereby\r\nunderlining the importance of an effective and efficient\r\nfunctioning of the broad range of institutional and\r\noperational instruments which exist within the OIC for the\r\nconduct of economic cooperation. Above all, however,\r\nthey underscore the imperative need for closer\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OIC in\r\nthe economic and social fields, including between the two\r\norganizations’ specialized agencies and institutions.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nIn this regard, my delegation is heartened by the\r\nencouraging progress in the 10 priority areas of cooperation\r\ndiscussed in the general meeting between the\r\nrepresentatives of the secretariats of the two organizations\r\nearlier this year. We look forward to the development of\r\nspecific proposals in areas such as science and technology,\r\ntrade and development, technical cooperation among\r\nIslamic countries, assistance to refugees, food security and\r\nagriculture, education and eradication of illiteracy, human\r\nresources development and the environment.\r\nFinally, Indonesia would like to join Qatar, Chairman\r\nof the twenty-fifth meeting of Foreign Ministers of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, in recommending\r\nthe adoption by consensus of the draft resolution before the\r\nAssembly. For, indeed, its objective of strengthening the\r\nbonds between the two organizations — their shared\r\ncommitment to peace and security and social and economic\r\ndevelopment — is one which deserves the continued\r\nsupport of Member States.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French): The\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) brings\r\ntogether more than 50 member States representing one fifth\r\nof the world’s population, spread over nearly all the\r\ncontinents. This nearly universal representativity confers on\r\nthe OIC duties and obligations on a global scale, and it is\r\ntherefore quite natural that it shares the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations as well as the same\r\nconcerns. This explains the great importance that OIC\r\nmember States attach to cooperation between the OIC and\r\nthe United Nations within the framework of a mutually\r\nbeneficial partnership.\r\nThis political will to consolidate, reinforce and expand\r\ncooperation has enabled the two organizations to establish\r\nappropriate machinery for consultations and to pool their\r\nefforts in the search for solutions to the crises which the\r\nIslamic Ummah is now experiencing.\r\nAmong such crises is the question of Palestine, which,\r\nhaving been at the origin of the founding of the OIC, is at\r\nthe forefront. My country, which is chairing the Committee\r\non the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\r\nPeople, can attest to the vitality of the relationship between\r\nthe two organizations on this issue.\r\nElsewhere, the conflicts now raging in Afghanistan,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and, very recently, in Kosovo,\r\nwhich could constitute serious threats to the peace and\r\nsecurity of the regions involved, have provided the two\r\norganizations an opportunity for working together in close\r\ncooperation to strengthen the impact of their joint efforts\r\nto search for and implement means of lessening tensions\r\nin those parts of the world.\r\nThe maintenance of peace, conflict management and\r\nthe search for political solutions to conflicts are not the\r\nsole framework for cooperation between the OIC and the\r\nUnited Nations. Increasingly, the two organizations have\r\nbeen building and strengthening cooperation all over,\r\ncovering the enormous and significant areas of economic\r\nand social development, the environment and refugees, to\r\nname only a few.\r\nMr. Filippi Balestra (San Marino), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nIn this context, the general meeting of\r\nrepresentatives of the secretariats of United Nations\r\nbodies and the OIC, held in Geneva on 13 and 15 July\r\n1998, is of particular importance.\r\nIt is also in this context that we welcome the fact\r\nthat, the United Nations Secretary-General attended the\r\neighth OIC Summit in Tehran in December 1997. That\r\nwas the first time a United Nations Secretary-General had\r\nattended an OIC Summit, and his presence will have the\r\neffect of opening up new prospects for consolidating and\r\nexpanding bonds of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Islamic Conference.\r\nOur world today is going through an era of\r\nnumerous serious challenges that require determination\r\nand a shared will on the part of the entire international\r\ncommunity. Here, cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nis an appropriate response. Such cooperation must be\r\nsustained and encouraged, and the adoption by consensus\r\nof the draft resolution before us, as contained in\r\ndocument A/53/L.13, would be a great contribution to that\r\nend.\r\nMr. Shahid (Bangladesh): The Bangladesh\r\ndelegation finds the report on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), as contained in document A/53/430,\r\nuseful in terms of understanding the level and depth of\r\nthe relationship between these two important\r\norganizations.\r\nWe are indeed encouraged by the growing\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference during the last\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nfew years, particularly during the past year, in a number of\r\nareas. We note with particular interest the cooperation\r\nbetween these two organizations in the fields of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and conflict resolution. In this\r\nconnection, my delegation commends the joint initiatives of\r\nthe United Nations and the OIC with regard to Afghanistan\r\nand Tajikistan and the exchange of views on other areas\r\nwith potential for conflict.\r\nWe would, however, like to point out that, while we\r\nwelcome initiative from the OIC in the peace and security\r\narea, we firmly believe that the United Nations must share\r\nthe primary responsibility for maintaining international\r\npeace and security. The efforts of such organizations as the\r\nOIC should be complementary to United Nations efforts,\r\nnot a substitute.\r\nThe root of conflict lies in poverty, deprivation and\r\ndiscrimination. It is unfortunate that, although much\r\ndesired, not enough attention has been devoted to\r\naddressing the challenges of poverty. We believe that a\r\nmajor focus of cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe OIC should be to address these challenges through all\r\navailable means. We are happy to note that a number of\r\norganizations of the United Nations system have entered\r\ninto collaborative activities with OIC, devoting their\r\nattention and resources to promoting better living conditions\r\nin the member countries of the OIC. We welcome such\r\ninitiatives and encourage them, as they meaningfully\r\ncontribute to addressing the challenges of development. We\r\nare particularly pleased about the recent cooperation\r\nagreement signed between OIC and the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) to promote activities relating to\r\nwomen’s health in the OIC countries.\r\nBangladesh is happy to note that the Government of\r\nSwitzerland has accorded full diplomatic facilities to the\r\nOIC representative in Geneva. My delegation has noted the\r\nviews expressed by the Permanent Observer of the Mission\r\nof the OIC to the United Nations on the formalization of\r\nthe status of the organization by the host Government and\r\nwe believe that this issue deserves favourable consideration.\r\nMr. Kamal (Pakistan): The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), under review\r\nin the General Assembly today, epitomizes the fact that\r\neffective cooperation between the international\r\norganizations could advance our collective goals of peace\r\nand prosperity.\r\nSince formalizing cooperation in 1978, the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nhave diversified mutual collaboration in a wide range of\r\nareas, including the political, cultural, humanitarian, trade\r\nand development, science and technology, education,\r\nenvironment and a number of other areas. The\r\nstrengthened cooperation in recent years in the area of\r\npreventive diplomacy and conflict resolution has yielded\r\npositive dividends. Their mutually supportive roles and\r\nefforts in some of the most egregious conflicts of modern\r\ntimes have received wide approbation and international\r\nrecognition. Particular mention must be made of their\r\nhistoric collaboration in pursuing reconciliation and the\r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Palestine, the Middle East, Jammu and\r\nKashmir, and Afghanistan.\r\nThe United Nations/OIC peacemaking mission to\r\nAfghanistan and a number of neighbouring countries\r\nduring the period from 20 March to 15 April 1998 was a\r\nvital initiative that marked a new dimension in their\r\ncooperation. The Special Envoy of the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General and the OIC Permanent Observer must\r\nbe commended for their untiring and determined efforts.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General rightly mentions that,\r\nthough this joint mission did not achieve any lasting\r\nresults, it underlined the valuable potential of concrete\r\njoint cooperation in the field of peacemaking beyond the\r\nconflict in Afghanistan.\r\nWe feel encouraged by the substantial progress made\r\nrecently by the latest United Nations/OIC joint initiative,\r\nundertaken in pursuance of the points of common\r\nunderstanding reached at the ministerial meeting of the\r\n“Six plus Two” group on Afghanistan in New York. The\r\nSpecial Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General,\r\nAmbassador Brahimi, and the Special Representative of\r\nthe OIC Secretary-General, Ambassador Ibrahim Saleh\r\nBakr, must be commended for their resolute efforts and\r\nsignificant success in defusing the tensions on the borders\r\nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic\r\nEmirate of Afghanistan.\r\nWe also welcome the positive gestures of the\r\nTaliban leadership, in deference to the demands of the\r\njoint United Nations/OIC mission, to allow the return of\r\nthe remaining dead bodies of the Iranian diplomats; the\r\nunconditional release of all Iranian prisoners; cooperation\r\nwith the investigations into the killing of the diplomats;\r\nassistance in the investigations into the reported mass\r\nkillings and mass graves; and the return of the United\r\nNations agencies and the international humanitarian\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\norganizations to resume their work in Afghanistan. It is our\r\nhope that the United Nations/OIC joint mission will succeed\r\nin its efforts to encourage a sustained dialogue between Iran\r\nand Afghanistan.\r\nIt is a matter of concern to all of us that the OIC\r\nPermanent Observer Mission has continued to function in\r\nNew York for over 20 years without the formal recognition\r\nof the host Government. The OIC Mission is being denied\r\nthe privileges and immunities which are essential for\r\nperforming its multifarious responsibilities. The Mission\r\nmust be accorded all the required facilities, as envisaged in\r\nArticle 105 of the United Nations Charter, and the relevant\r\nprovisions of the United Nations Headquarters agreement\r\nwith the host country.\r\nI may mention here that the Government of Pakistan\r\nhas extended full diplomatic facilities to the Office of the\r\nOIC Permanent Representative to Afghanistan, based in\r\nIslamabad, which have facilitated its work, particularly the\r\njoint United Nations-OIC cooperation. Similarly, the\r\nGovernment of Switzerland has extended necessary\r\nprivileges to the OIC Observer Mission in Geneva,\r\nfacilitating its effective cooperation with the United Nations\r\nand the specialized agencies based in Europe. There is no\r\nreason why similar treatment could not be accorded to the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference in New York. This\r\nunfortunate anomaly must be rectified immediately, so that\r\nthe OIC can function effectively and fulfil its tasks\r\nmeaningfully.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express our hope that\r\nthe cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference will continue to\r\nflourish in all spheres in promoting the common goals of\r\nthe international community.\r\nMr. Snoussi (Morocco) (interpretation from French):\r\nAllow me at the outset to express my sincere thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report, submitted pursuant to\r\nparagraph 12 of General Assembly resolution 52/4 of 22\r\nOctober 1997, on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC),\r\nwhich appears in document A/53/430.\r\nI also wish to express the satisfaction of my delegation\r\nand its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his special\r\ninterest in the work of the OIC. This was borne out by his\r\nparticipation in the coordinating meeting of OIC Foreign\r\nMinisters, held in New York in parallel with the work of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-second session, and in the\r\nEighth OIC Summit, which was held at Tehran from 9 to\r\n11 December 1997.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to warmly\r\nthank the Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar,\r\nMr. Nasser Abdulaziz Al-Nassir, for introducing the draft\r\nresolution on this item in document A/53/L.13.\r\nOver the years, and since the cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the OIC became institutionalized,\r\nthe bonds of cooperation between the two organizations\r\nhave steadily developed. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral clearly reflects the various aspects of the\r\ncooperation in the period under consideration.\r\nWe welcome the commendable efforts by the two\r\norganizations to step up their cooperation in all areas of\r\ncommon interest. In this spirit, we are pleased to note\r\ntheir resolve to strengthen further the ties of cooperation\r\nin the political domain, especially with regard to the\r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts and in the areas of\r\ncoordination and economic and social development. In\r\nthis regard, Morocco welcomes their joint efforts to help\r\nresolve conflicts in countries members of the OIC, as in\r\nthe cases of Somalia, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and\r\nencourages them to continue their efforts in that area.\r\nMorocco is pleased to note the general meeting of\r\nthe organizations and agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem and of the OIC and its specialized institutions,\r\nwhich took place in Geneva from 13 to 15 July 1998, and\r\nhopes that the programme of work for the period\r\n1998-1999 will be implemented and yield the expected\r\nresults. We are pleased to welcome the results of various\r\naspects of the economic and social cooperation, as\r\noutlined in the report of the Secretary-General.\r\nDespite all these positive aspects, much remains to\r\nbe done, and the situation of a great many Muslims in the\r\nMiddle East, the Balkans and Afghanistan calls for\r\nparticular attention on our part and requires that we\r\nredouble our efforts so that practical and lasting solutions\r\ncan be identified and implemented to enable the\r\npopulations of those regions to live in peace.\r\nIf the cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe OIC is to yield the results for which we are all\r\nhoping, we believe that the two organizations must be\r\nendowed with the means necessary for them to fulfil their\r\nmandates in a satisfactory manner. To that end, we\r\nbelieve that it is essential to grant the Office of the\r\nPermanent Observer for the OIC in New York the\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nfacilities that would undoubtedly assist it in fulfilling its\r\nobligations in favourable conditions.\r\nThat having been said, we hope that the adoption of\r\nthe draft resolution before us today will make it possible to\r\nenter a new phase of strengthened links of cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the two organizations aimed at\r\nachieving the noble objectives articulated in their respective\r\nCharters.\r\nMr. Rastan (Malaysia): My delegation is very pleased\r\nto speak on this agenda item. We are especially pleased that\r\nsince it was first considered by the General Assembly at its\r\nthirty-fifth session, significant progress has been achieved\r\nin the cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). This\r\nprogress is well reflected in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nin document A/53/430. Malaysia fully supports further\r\nefforts to strengthen the fruitful cooperation that already\r\nexists between the two organizations. We are convinced\r\nthat both would find further mutual benefit through\r\nincreased cooperation. The OIC certainly can do a lot to\r\ncomplement the United Nations in the pursuit of many\r\ncommon goals.\r\nThe OIC was founded to strengthen unity and\r\nsolidarity among the Islamic Ummah, or community.\r\nMalaysia is happy to be a member of the OIC and to have\r\nbeen associated with its activities since its establishment\r\nsome 30 ago. The late Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, our\r\nfirst Prime Minister, became the first Secretary-General of\r\nthe OIC. Malaysia has participated in the various OIC\r\nsummits and other meetings held at the ministerial, senior\r\nofficial and expert levels. We are pleased that the\r\nmembership of the OIC has increased steadily. As with the\r\nmembership of the United Nations, countries from various\r\nregions of the world make up the membership of the OIC.\r\nMalaysia is pleased that Guyana has become the newest\r\nmember of the OIC and that Thailand has been accepted as\r\nan observer. Both countries are active Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. They can surely join others to make\r\nimportant contributions to the work of the OIC, including\r\nwith respect to the organization’s cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nCurrently with 56 members, the OIC represents\r\ncountries which constitute nearly one third of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations. As an organization, the\r\nOIC has contributed and can continue to contribute\r\nconstructively and positively to many United Nations\r\nactivities. It shares many common objectives with the\r\nUnited Nations in respect of peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. Its activities complement and strengthen\r\nthose of the United Nations in many areas, thus\r\ncontributing to the promotion and realization of the\r\nprinciples and purposes set out in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Islamic countries today are confronted with the\r\nchallenges of the modern era. One of those is to present\r\nthe true image of Islam as a religion of peace. At the\r\nEighth Islamic Summit Conference, in Tehran in\r\nDecember 1997, the Kings, heads of State and heads of\r\nGovernment of the OIC member countries expressed their\r\nconcern at tendencies to portray Islam as a threat to the\r\nworld, whereas Islamic civilization is firmly and\r\nhistorically grounded in peaceful coexistence, cooperation\r\nand mutual understanding among civilizations. My\r\ndelegation believes that the United Nations is uniquely\r\nplaced to bridge the gap between the Islamic countries\r\nand the rest of the international community through\r\ndialogue and cooperation. Therefore, we believe that the\r\nproposal by President Mohammed Khatami of Iran, which\r\ncalls for the designation of the year 2001 as the Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, is indeed timely and should\r\nbe widely supported. We think the United Nations and the\r\nOIC can cooperate meaningfully in achieving the\r\nobjective of that proposal.\r\nMy delegation is fully appreciative of the keen\r\ninterest shown by the United Nations Secretary-General\r\nin the activities of the OIC. The Secretary-General\r\nattended the Eighth OIC Summit in Tehran and also\r\naddressed the annual coordination meeting of the OIC\r\nForeign Ministers held at United Nations Headquarters in\r\nOctober 1997. We also recall that he sent his\r\nrepresentatives to attend the twenty-fifth meeting of the\r\nOIC Foreign Ministers, in Doha in March 1998, and the\r\nannual coordination meeting of the OIC Foreign Ministers\r\nheld recently in New York. In his address at the OIC\r\ncoordination meeting last year, the Secretary-General\r\nreferred to the United Nations as “our common home”.\r\nThe United Nations and the OIC, while serving in\r\ndifferent capacities, indeed serve one common\r\nconstituency: humanity. Deepening relations and increased\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OIC\r\nwould, in the view of my delegation, help both\r\norganizations and their member States provide better\r\nservice to that common constituency.\r\nWe believe both organizations can continue to\r\nexplore new dimensions of cooperation in the field of\r\npeace and security, as well as in other fields. The\r\npeacemaking mission to Afghanistan undertaken jointly\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nby the United Nations and OIC last March and April was\r\ncertainly a step in the right direction. My delegation\r\nconcurs with the Secretary-General, who stated in his report\r\nthat the mission underlined the valuable potential of\r\nconcrete joint cooperation in the field of peacemaking\r\nbetween the United Nations and OIC. We agree that such\r\nefforts could be extended beyond the conflict in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nMalaysia believes that a smart partnership could be\r\nfurther developed between the two organizations in\r\ncomplementing each other’s activities in the social, cultural\r\nand economic fields. In this regard, we welcome the\r\ngeneral meeting between the representatives of the United\r\nNations system and the OIC and its specialized institutions\r\nheld in Geneva last July. We hope that further discussions\r\nwill be carried out and follow-up action taken on the\r\nvarious items in the agenda, which is quite comprehensive,\r\nincluding on proposals for enhancing the mechanisms of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations system and the\r\nOIC and its specialized institutions.\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the increasing\r\nnumber of cooperative arrangements between the United\r\nNations system and the OIC and its specialized institutions.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report provides very useful\r\ninformation on the level and extent of cooperation between\r\nvarious United Nations agencies on the one hand, and the\r\nOIC and its specialized institutions on the other. For\r\nexample, we note that the International Fund for\r\nAgricultural Development has cooperated with the Islamic\r\nDevelopment Bank (IDB) in co-financing 14 projects in 11\r\nIslamic countries targeted to assist the most vulnerable of\r\nthe rural poor. The International Labour Organization has\r\nbeen supportive of national development efforts of\r\nindividual OIC member States. The United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund and the OIC, through its specialized\r\ninstitution, the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (ISESCO), have rededicated their efforts to\r\nensure the survival, protection and well-being of children in\r\nthe Islamic world. The United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme and ISESCO, supported by the IDB and the\r\nFaysal Islamic Bank, have launched a joint initiative to hold\r\na series of seminars on the theme of “Environment and\r\nIslam: towards an ethical environmental charter”. Malaysia\r\nsupports these activities and others which both the United\r\nNations and the OIC have identified.\r\nMy delegation believes that, in the face of the\r\nchallenges posed by globalization and market\r\nliberalization — particularly their negative impact on the\r\neconomies of the developing countries, many of whom are\r\nmembers of the OIC — the dialogue that has been started\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions could also be extended to include dialogue\r\nwith the specialized institutions of the OIC, in particular\r\nthe IDB. Such a dialogue could contribute towards the\r\ndevelopment of ideas and proposals which would assist\r\nthe international community in responding to such\r\nchallenges, including the proposal to revamp the global\r\nfinancial architecture. The OIC may also want to take\r\nsteps in this direction.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to extend its\r\nsincere appreciation to the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Secretary-General of the OIC for\r\ntheir tireless efforts in forging the cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and OIC.\r\nMr. Tekaya (Tunisia) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe United Nations Charter has laid the foundation for\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations as evidence of what such cooperation can\r\ncontribute to crystallize the principles and objectives of\r\nthe United Nations in different fields.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which is\r\nbeing discussed by the General Assembly, is a vivid\r\nexample of what can result from cooperation between a\r\nregional organization and the United Nations, as attested\r\nto by the comprehensive report by the Secretary-General\r\non this subject. This cooperation covers several fields —\r\npolitical, social, humanitarian — within the framework of\r\ncoordination and consultation, and the two Organizations\r\nare attempting to find solutions to problems related to\r\ninternational peace and security, disarmament, self-\r\ndetermination, decolonization, fundamental human rights,\r\neconomic and social development and technical\r\ncooperation.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOIC has grown in the field of peacekeeping as well as in\r\npreventive diplomacy. In this area, consultations between\r\nthem have been fostered through their joint endeavour to\r\nfind a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan. It is with\r\nsatisfaction that we note this and support it as we support\r\nall aspects of consultations between the two organizations\r\nand of coordination of their efforts relevant to all other\r\nproblems of common interest.\r\nFurthermore, in the economic and social field,\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OIC has\r\nrecorded great progress in the fields of trade, technical\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\ncooperation, food security, agriculture, development of\r\nhuman resources and the provision of assistance to\r\nrefugees, as well as in other fields, of which there are many\r\nexamples.\r\nWithin this framework we call for further technical aid\r\nand all other forms of assistance by the United Nations and\r\nits relevant specialized agencies to the OIC and the\r\ndifferent subsidiary organs in order to consolidate such\r\ncooperation. Accordingly, we support the draft resolution\r\nbefore the Assembly on cooperation between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to refer to the importance\r\nwe attach to having the Office of the Permanent Observer\r\nof the OIC in New York be provided with the facilities and\r\nthe different privileges afforded other observer missions.\r\nThis would facilitate its ability to carry out its work and\r\nresponsibilities in the manner expected of it.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin the debate on this item.\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution 3369\r\n(XXX) of 10 October 1975, I now call upon the Observer\r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nMr. Lamani (Organization of the Islamic Conference)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): Since this is the first time that\r\nI am addressing the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession, I should like to take this opportunity, on behalf of\r\nthe Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, Mr. Azzedine Laraki, and on my own behalf,\r\nto extend our congratulations to the President on his\r\nelection. We are confident that his wide experience and his\r\ndiplomatic skills are the best guarantee that the conduct of\r\nthe Assembly will be accomplished in an effective and\r\ndecisive manner. I should also like to express our\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,\r\nfor the success he achieved in steering the work of the\r\nfifty-second session.\r\nAs we consider agenda item 26, on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC), I am honoured to review some\r\nof the developments that have taken place in this regard in\r\nthe political, economic, social and humanitarian fields\r\nduring the period under review.\r\nBoth organizations share a commitment to intensifying\r\ncooperation and coordination to find solutions to issues of\r\ncommon concern such as peace, security, disarmament,\r\nbasic human rights, economic and social development and\r\ntechnical cooperation. The report of the Secretary-General\r\nwhich is now before us has highlighted this cooperation.\r\nIn this regard, may I express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his wise conduct of the work of the\r\nOrganization and also express our appreciation to the\r\nexecutive heads of the various United Nations funds,\r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies for their unremitting\r\nefforts towards the effective implementation of our joint\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIn recognition of the growing needs and common\r\nrequirements of our member States, General Assembly\r\nresolution 52/4 of 22 October 1997 called for the\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between our two\r\norganizations in the political, social, economic and\r\nhumanitarian fields. The report of the Secretary-General\r\ncontains a detailed review of these issues. Progress in\r\nthese efforts was also reviewed at this year’s meeting of\r\nthe Secretaries-General of the United Nations and of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, which was held\r\nat United Nations Headquarters on 29 September 1998,\r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly.\r\nEarlier, a general meeting on cooperation between\r\nrepresentatives of the secretariats of the United Nations\r\nsystem and of the OIC and its specialized institutions had\r\nbeen held at the United Nations Office at Geneva from 13\r\nto 15 July 1998. At that meeting, the results of our joint\r\nactivities and plans for the next biennium were examined,\r\ntogether with proposals for strengthening mechanisms for\r\ncooperation between our two organizations.\r\nHere I want to highlight two examples of our\r\ncooperation in the political sphere during the period under\r\nreview. First, a joint mission to Afghanistan and\r\nneighbouring States was organized last March and April,\r\nled by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Special Envoy of the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations for Afghanistan.\r\nI had the privilege of participating in that mission on\r\nbehalf of the OIC. Despite the complexities of the Afghan\r\nissue, those efforts helped to open dialogue among the\r\nAfghan factions and with neighbouring States. They also\r\npaved the way for further coordination and cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations in the search for viable\r\nsolutions to this long-standing issue. Regular consultations\r\non this issue have continued between the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of our two organizations; they agreed at their\r\nmeeting at United Nations Headquarters on 29 September\r\n1998 to dispatch another joint mission to the region, led\r\nby Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, in view of the recent escalation\r\nof tension in the area. There is no doubt that these joint\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nefforts, which are supported and called for by the countries\r\nof the region through the recommendations of the 6 + 2\r\nministerial meeting on Afghanistan, clearly testify to the\r\nfeasibility of cooperation between the two organizations in\r\nthe sphere of peacemaking.\r\nAs regards the situation in Tajikistan, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report indicates, the OIC participated as an\r\nobserver in the United Nations-sponsored inter-Tajik talks\r\nthat concluded in 1997 with the signing of the General\r\nAgreement. The OIC is a member of the contact group\r\nestablished in connection with the peace process in\r\nTajikistan.\r\nMoreover, consultations continue between the\r\nSecretaries-General of the two organizations with regard to\r\nother important and urgent issues of common concern,\r\nincluding the question of Palestine, the situation in the\r\nMiddle East, the Lockerbie issue, the conflict in Somalia,\r\nthe Jammu and Kashmir dispute, the questions of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, Kosovo and Sierra Leone, and other\r\nmatters.\r\nI turn now from the political sphere to our cooperation\r\nin the field of economic and social development. Again, as\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report illustrates, progress continues\r\nin the areas of technology, trade, development, and\r\ntechnical cooperation among Islamic States, in addition to\r\nthe questions of assistance to refugees, food security,\r\nagriculture, education, fighting illiteracy, investment\r\nmechanisms, development of human resources and the\r\nenvironment. Examples of such cooperation are on the\r\nincrease. In this respect, I shall cite the recent training\r\ncourse for a number of institutions in Africa and the Arab\r\nStates in food technology and textiles, held at Cairo in\r\ncooperation with the Islamic Chamber of Commerce and\r\nIndustry, the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) and the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of\r\nCommerce and Industry. Another example was the signing\r\nof a memorandum of understanding earlier in October 1998\r\nby the OIC Secretary-General and the Executive Director of\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund to enhance cooperation\r\nin the fields of family education, population census,\r\nreproductive health and related questions. Also worth\r\nmentioning is our ongoing cooperation with the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund and other programmes and\r\nagencies of the United Nations.\r\nI turn now to the OIC’s interest in the matter of\r\nUnited Nations reform. OIC member States have a direct\r\nand vital stake in determining the outcome of those\r\nreforms. This was affirmed by the most recent annual\r\ncoordination meeting of Foreign Ministers of OIC\r\nmember States, held in New York on 1 October 1998.\r\nHis Excellency the Permanent Representative of\r\nQatar, in his capacity as Chairman of the Islamic Group,\r\nhas just introduced a draft resolution on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference, which is before the Assembly in\r\ndocument A/53/L.13 of 27 October 1998. I hope it will be\r\nadopted by consensus. I would like to draw attention to\r\ntwo paragraphs of the operative part because of their\r\nimportance.\r\nFirst, paragraph 4, which requests the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of the Islamic Conference to\r\ncontinue to cooperate in their common search for\r\nsolutions to global problems, such as questions relating to\r\ninternational peace and security, disarmament, self-\r\ndetermination, fundamental human rights, social and\r\neconomic development, and technical cooperation. There\r\nis no doubt that this paragraph reflects the will of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to involve the OIC in diplomatic and\r\nmediation efforts to find solutions for a number of issues\r\nof common concern.\r\nSecondly, paragraph 10 urges the United Nations and\r\nother organizations of the United Nations system,\r\nespecially the lead agencies, to provide increased\r\ntechnical and other forms of assistance to the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary\r\norgans and specialized and affiliated institutions in order\r\nto enhance cooperation. We would welcome such support,\r\nwhich would strengthen our capacity to help make the\r\nOIC contribution to our joint programmes and activities\r\nmore effective.\r\nAllow me to raise an issue which I had hesitated to\r\nmention before the General Assembly. However it is my\r\nhope that raising it will enable us to achieve the desired\r\nobjective. The issue concerns the facilities and privileges\r\ngranted to missions to the United Nations in accordance\r\nwith the Headquarters Agreement. It is well known that\r\nthe Permanent Observer Mission of the OIC, like those of\r\nthe League of Arab States and of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, does not fully enjoy these facilities and\r\nprivileges as compared to the missions of some other\r\nregional organizations. I should mention here that the\r\nPermanent Observer Mission of the OIC and the offices\r\nof other intergovernmental and regional organizations\r\naccredited to the United Nations Office at Geneva enjoy\r\nall such facilities and privileges, which enables them to\r\ncarry out their various tasks and responsibilities more\r\neffectively.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 48th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nThe Permanent Observer of the League of Arab States\r\nraised this issue in his statement before the General\r\nAssembly last week. We raise it once again in the hope that\r\nthe authorities responsible for the implementation of the\r\nHeadquarters Agreement will give serious consideration to\r\nthis matter and will attach to it the importance it deserves\r\nso that we can discharge our responsibilities fully and\r\neffectively.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm our ongoing\r\ninterest in cooperation and coordination with the United\r\nNations and our full commitment to the provisions and the\r\nnoble purposes of the Charter.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now take\r\na decision on draft resolution A/53/L.13.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt that\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.13 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/16).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 26?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
