(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Semakula\r\nKiwanuka (Uganda), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 35\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/419)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Burkina Faso, who will speak on behalf of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): In his statement to the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly last September, the current Chairman of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) stated,\r\n“In their struggle and daily efforts to emerge from\r\nunderdevelopment, African Governments and peoples\r\nare not alone. They know how to rely on the sincere\r\nsupport of their friends. This includes the operational\r\ndevelopment system of the United Nations, which I\r\nshould like to commend for its dedication to the\r\nuplifting struggle against poverty and other forms of\r\ndeprivation that afflict African peoples.” (A/53/PV.7,\r\np. 18)\r\nToday — at the exact moment when we are being\r\ncalled upon to consider the question of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity — that statement is particularly significant.\r\nGiven their very noble ideal of safeguarding peace, these\r\ntwo institutions cannot be opposed to each other but\r\nrather must complement each other. Without being\r\nostentatious, the current cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity\r\nnonetheless sets a high standard. At the outset, however,\r\nthese organizations’ relations consisted only of the\r\nexistence in Addis Ababa of the Economic Commission\r\nfor Africa (ECA), which was followed by the\r\nestablishment in New York of an observer mission of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity to the United Nations.\r\nAs the first element of this cooperation, the ECA has\r\ndone useful work, particularly in carrying out programmes\r\nin the area of transportation and telecommunications\r\nduring the United Nations Decade for Transport and\r\nCommunications in Africa, as well as in the areas of\r\nscience and technology, trade, small- and medium-sized\r\nbusinesses and so forth. For example, the ECA\r\ncontributed to the elaboration of the Lagos Plan of\r\nAction, a genuine distillation of Africa’s strategy for\r\nendogenous and self-reliant development.\r\nI should also highlight the very effective work done\r\nby the United Nations Development Programme through\r\nits African offices, as well as the work of the specialized\r\nagencies, such as the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nChildren’s Fund, the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development, the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\nof the United Nations, the World Health Organization and\r\nthe World Food Programme. Nor should I overlook the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, the United Nations Environment Programme, the\r\nUnited Nations Information Centres, the United Nations\r\nSudano-Sahelian Office, the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and, of course, the\r\nBretton Woods institutions.\r\nNowadays, we are witnessing a true institutionalization\r\nof relations between the two organizations in the form of\r\nperiodic meetings and consultations between the two\r\nSecretaries-General, exchanges of information, coordination\r\nof actions and cooperation programmes.\r\nIn terms of institutional relations, the only blemish\r\nremaining is the restrictiveness of the symbolic status of the\r\nOAU observer mission here in New York, and we thus call\r\nfor an expansion of its rights to enable it to do its job\r\nproperly. However commendable and tangible it may be,\r\nthis cooperation still needs to be strengthened in view of\r\nthe immense challenges facing today’s world. The United\r\nNations could, for example, step up its cooperation by\r\ntaking into consideration the priorities set by the OAU’s\r\nthirty-fourth summit.\r\nIn the area of peacekeeping, the current Chairman of\r\nthe OAU appealed to the United Nations\r\n“to contribute not only to strengthening structurally the\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution in Africa, but also to provide technical and\r\nlogistical support, since in the end we share the same\r\nideal: assuring for our world the security and peace\r\nessential to its development and flourishing”. (ibid.)\r\nGiven this perspective, a United Nations contribution\r\nto the OAU Peace Fund, which was created in March 1993\r\nprimarily to consolidate the efforts of preventive diplomacy,\r\nwould certainly be greatly appreciated. There is no need to\r\nspell out the fact that financial and logistical management\r\nof crises is a tremendous burden for our weak economies.\r\nStill in the same sphere, it would be desirable for the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General to send a representative\r\nto all African meetings dealing with conflict settlement.\r\nSuch an approach would make it possible to understand\r\nbetter, at first hand and in greater depth, the issues involved\r\nin certain African decisions. I note as a very timely move\r\nthat the current Chairman of the OAU invited the United\r\nNations Secretary-General or his representative to\r\nparticipate in the next meeting on the dispute between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, scheduled for Ouagadougou on 7\r\nand 8 November next.\r\nClearly, Africa, which is caught up in the problems\r\nof globalization and the world economic crisis, relies a\r\ngreat deal on cooperation with the United Nations\r\noperational system in order to secure its own\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBut what can we expect from the United Nations? In\r\nterms of cooperation in the area of economic development\r\nstricto sensu, it would be tedious to go back over what\r\nAfrica can expect from the United Nations in terms of\r\nresource mobilization, debt alleviation or debt forgiveness\r\n— all these things have been extensively discussed in the\r\ncontext of the consideration of the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the situation in Africa and in the debate on the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s.\r\nThe new approach that I am proposing is rather to\r\ndetermine what kind of assistance the United Nations can\r\ngive in the area of development strategy and\r\nmethodology. The suggestions that come to mind are as\r\nfollows.\r\nFirst of all, the United Nations should readjust its\r\napproach vis-à-vis Africa — that is, as far as possible, it\r\nshould avoid a superficial approach to helping us, but\r\nrather should use genuine substantive analysis and take\r\ninto account our specific realities. In this regard, I note\r\nthat the Secretary-General recently organized a high-level\r\nmeeting of mostly African leaders to study his report on\r\nthe situation in Africa. Doubtless, the conclusions yielded\r\nby that meeting, together with the proposals made in the\r\nGeneral Assembly, will be crucial in identifying solutions\r\nto the problems of debt, rationalizing human resources,\r\nmobilization of financial resources and so forth. This kind\r\nof initiative deserves to be encouraged.\r\nHence, thanks to its specialized institutions, the\r\nUnited Nations should be able to help Africa take into\r\naccount the cultural dimension of its development, since\r\ndevelopment for African society implies the ability to\r\nassimilate innovations and changes, as we have seen in\r\nthe case of Asian countries. This last requirement also\r\npresupposes support for the efforts of the OAU to\r\npromote human resources development because the centre\r\nof all development is the human being.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nThrough its vast experience and its capable staff, the\r\nUnited Nations can help African countries institute a\r\npolitical and legal environment conducive to development.\r\nBy setting up measures that will encourage disarmament, it\r\ncan help the countries of Africa redirect certain military\r\nexpenditures to the needs of development.\r\nIn the immediate future, however, the tangible\r\ncooperation that the OAU keenly awaits from the United\r\nNations is willing and massive support for the holding of\r\nthe economic summit of 1999. The Secretary-General is\r\nalready committed to this undertaking. There can be no\r\ndoubt that that highly important meeting will further\r\nconsolidate and strengthen cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OAU, to the greater benefit of the peoples\r\nof Africa and of humankind as a whole.\r\nMr. Sucharipa (Austria): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. In addition, the Central\r\nand Eastern European countries associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and\r\nSlovenia — and the associated country, Cyprus, align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nFirst of all, the European Union would like to express\r\nits appreciation to the Secretary-General for the report\r\nsubmitted under the agenda item we are now considering.\r\nTogether with the landmark document on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa, which we had the occasion to\r\ndiscuss two weeks ago, this report underlines the\r\nimportance of close cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nThe European Union welcomes the ongoing dialogue\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OAU aimed at building\r\ncloser ties in order to enhance their mutual capacity for\r\npreventing and resolving conflicts in Africa and for\r\ncoordinating their efforts in that regard, in particular\r\nthrough the meetings of the two Secretaries-General and\r\ntheir senior advisers in Addis Ababa and in New York\r\nearlier this year.\r\nOver the last year the number of violent conflicts in\r\nAfrica has increased, and some of them show alarming\r\nsigns of deterioration. Grave breaches of humanitarian law\r\nand human rights, the plight of refugees, ethnic hatred and\r\narms-trafficking remain among the key problems of\r\nregional and international concern. While stressing the\r\nprimary responsibility of the Security Council for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\r\nEuropean Union considers it essential that African\r\ncountries and regional organizations play a leading role in\r\nconflict prevention and resolution in Africa.\r\nWe welcome the adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 1197 (1998), which aims at supporting regional\r\ninitiatives in Africa, as well as enhancing coordination\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OAU in the field of\r\nconflict prevention and the maintenance of peace. We\r\nhope that the expeditious implementation of the many\r\naspects contained in that resolution will contribute to\r\nfurther strengthening the ties between the two\r\norganizations. We also welcome the statement of the\r\nSecurity Council President on 16 September this year\r\n(S/PRST/1998/28), in which the Council expressed its\r\ncommitment to exercising its responsibility in relation to\r\nAfrica and reaffirmed, inter alia, the need to strengthen\r\nAfrica’s capacity to participate in all aspects of\r\npeacekeeping operations, including the military, police,\r\nhumanitarian and other civilian components.\r\nThe prevention and resolution of conflicts in Africa\r\nconstitute priorities for the European Union and we are\r\ncommitted to working in partnership with Africa to secure\r\npeace and democracy, respect for human rights, political\r\nstability and economic and social development. We are\r\ncommitted to a proactive policy focusing on preventing\r\nthe outbreak of violent conflicts at an early stage, as well\r\nas on post-conflict peace-building and using the full range\r\nof policy instruments available. These goals are set out in\r\nthe European Union’s Common Position on Conflict\r\nPrevention and Resolution in Africa, agreed in 1997. In\r\nthis context, the European Union continues its support of\r\nthe OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution.\r\nIn May 1998, the European Union adopted the\r\nCommon Position on Human Rights, Democratic\r\nPrinciples, the Rule of Law and Good Governance in\r\nAfrica. This Common Position gives a high priority to a\r\npositive and constructive approach with a view to\r\nsupporting efforts of the OAU, subregional groups and\r\nindividual countries to promote respect for human rights\r\nand good governance.\r\nThe Union has established a consultative mechanism\r\nwith the OAU, which we wish to develop further. We\r\nwill strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and\r\nsubregional organizations on concrete possibilities for\r\nbacking their efforts, inter alia, in the fields of early\r\nwarning, preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and\r\nawareness of the importance of respect for human rights,\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nthe rule of law, a pluralistic society, democratic institutions\r\nand practices and a culture of tolerance.\r\nOver the last 10 years, African countries have initiated\r\na number of reforms aimed at democracy and respect of\r\nhuman rights. However, the mechanisms to solve and\r\nmanage tensions and differences require strengthening.\r\nConflict prevention and management call for a pluralistic\r\ncivil society which is based on dialogue and the networking\r\nof various interest groups, political systems which are based\r\non cooperation rather than confrontation, as well as the rule\r\nof law to protect democratic principles and human rights.\r\nThe European Union is also willing to further increase its\r\ncooperation with the OAU and its member States in these\r\nareas.\r\nWe welcome the OAU’s endorsement, at its summit\r\nin Ouagadougou in June 1998, of the EU’s proposal to\r\nhold, in the first half of the year 2000, a summit of the\r\nheads of State and Government of the European Union and\r\nof Africa. We are intensively working on the preparation of\r\nthe summit in order to achieve a successful outcome. The\r\nsummit will offer a unique opportunity to debate political\r\nand economic subjects of common interest at the highest\r\npolitical level.\r\nThe Union attaches great importance to the regular\r\ncontacts and dialogue which it holds with regional and\r\nsubregional organizations in Africa and we work to enhance\r\nour dialogue, inter alia, with the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) in eastern Africa and\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS). Cooperation between the European Union and\r\nthe Southern African Development Community (SADC) has\r\ncontinued to progress and a comprehensive dialogue has\r\nbeen established in various areas of cooperation. The third\r\nSADC-European Union Ministerial Conference will take\r\nplace in Vienna in early November. It will review\r\ncooperation between the European Union and SADC since\r\n1994 and determine the priorities for future cooperation.\r\nAfrica, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, stands at the\r\ncrossroads. On the one hand, we observe important signs of\r\npolitical and socio-economic progress; on the other, violent\r\nconflicts are spreading over parts of the continent,\r\nthreatening to escalate into open regional warfare. The\r\nEuropean Union would like to reiterate its deep concern\r\nover the fact that, in spite of important regional and\r\nsubregional efforts, instability seems to be gaining ground.\r\nThis apparent downward spiral has to be stopped and we\r\ncall upon all concerned to do their utmost and to seek\r\npeaceful solutions. The European Union strongly believes\r\nthat closer United Nations-OAU cooperation is a key\r\nfactor in improving the chances of reaching lasting\r\nsettlements.\r\nRegarding the Great Lakes region, we give full\r\nsupport to the diplomatic efforts of the United Nations\r\nand the OAU, as well as of regional leaders and other\r\npersonalities concerned, to restore peace to the region and\r\npromote national reconciliation. We continue to support\r\nthe idea of convening an international conference at an\r\nappropriate time, under the joint auspices of the United\r\nNations and the OAU and enjoying the support of all the\r\nStates of the region, in order to address, within a global\r\napproach, the root causes of the conflicts in the region.\r\nThe European Union Special Envoy for the Great Lakes\r\nRegion, Ambassador Aldo Ajello, whose mandate the\r\nEuropean Union has just extended until 31 July next year,\r\nwill continue to work closely with the relevant\r\norganizations and personalities.\r\nThe Union is deeply concerned about the ongoing\r\ncrisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the\r\nthreat any escalation of the conflict poses to the region as\r\na whole. We support the principle of the territorial\r\nintegrity and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and its neighbouring countries and we call, in\r\nthis context, for a cessation of external interference.\r\nGovernments should use their influence to advance the\r\ncause of peace. There can be no military solution to the\r\nconflict and we call upon the parties to agree to an\r\nimmediate ceasefire. We welcome African initiatives to\r\nfind a peaceful negotiated settlement acceptable to all\r\nCongolese. We stand ready to help the political dialogue\r\nand to support any negotiation scheme obtaining the\r\nconsent of all parties involved, inter alia, through the\r\nassistance of the EU Special Envoy for the Great Lakes\r\nRegion. The Union strongly urges the parties involved in\r\nthe conflict to respect human rights and humanitarian law\r\nand to abstain from acts of indiscriminate violence,\r\nespecially against civilians, and ethnic propaganda and\r\nharassment. We urge the parties to secure safe and\r\nunimpeded access for humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe European Union is deeply dismayed at the\r\nsevere deterioration of the political and military situation\r\nin Angola, which threatens to reverse the peace process\r\ninto a full-scale military confrontation. We are convinced\r\nthat a lasting peace in Angola can be obtained only by\r\nfull compliance with the Lusaka Protocol, which, together\r\nwith the “Acordos de Paz” and the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council, remain the fundamental basis for the\r\npeace process. UNITA’s leadership has to comply\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nimmediately and without condition with its obligations\r\nunder the Lusaka Protocol. It has to give up any military\r\nambition, refrain from rearming, fully demobilize and,\r\nfinally, transform itself from a military organization into a\r\ncivilian political party. It has to allow the extension of State\r\nadministration throughout the whole country. The European\r\nUnion is taking all measures in order to fully implement the\r\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council against UNITA\r\nand urges all States to do likewise in order to encourage\r\nUNITA to abide by its obligations.\r\nThe European Union welcomes and fully supports the\r\nefforts of the OAU to bring a negotiated settlement to the\r\nborder conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia and we urge\r\nboth parties to do their utmost towards a peaceful solution.\r\nThe European Union urges the parties in Guinea-\r\nBissau to continue negotiations under the joint Community\r\nof Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP)/ECOWAS\r\nmediation to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. With\r\nregard to Sierra Leone, we strongly condemn the reported\r\natrocities committed by rebel forces. We encourage the\r\nGovernment of Sierra Leone to do its utmost to foster\r\npeace and the reconciliation process in the country.\r\nRegarding the conflict in Somalia, which has taken a\r\nterrible toll, especially among civilians, the European Union\r\nremains deeply concerned at the Somali leaders’ inability to\r\nnegotiate a peaceful settlement of their disputes.\r\nThe time is opportune to focus our attention on the\r\nsustainable development of Africa, which remains a major\r\nchallenge to be met by the African continent. It is\r\nencouraging to note that numerous African countries have\r\nundertaken sweeping reforms of their economic policies and\r\nof the public sector and that, after two decades of decline,\r\nwe have recently been able to observe signs of economic\r\nrecovery. Although this globally positive trend may mask\r\nsubstantial disparities amongst African countries and\r\nremains fragile to external and internal shocks, it does give\r\nreason for optimism.\r\nAt the same time, the fight against widespread poverty\r\nin Africa remains one of the crucial challenges of our time.\r\nIn this context, economic growth has to be accelerated and\r\ndevelopment programmes have to ensure that the poorest\r\ngroups of the population are their first beneficiaries. Human\r\nand social development should be moved to the centre of\r\nmacroeconomic policy design and implementation.\r\nThe European Union remains committed to the fight\r\nagainst poverty and to meeting the target of reducing the\r\nproportion of people living in extreme poverty by half by\r\nthe year 2015. The Union — as the major donor to\r\nAfrica, contributing two thirds of total official\r\ndevelopment assistance flows to sub-Saharan Africa, and\r\nas the most open market for those countries — is\r\ncommitted to renewing the partnership agreement with the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and to\r\ntransforming the Lomé Convention into an even more\r\nmodern and efficient framework for cooperation which\r\nwill remain strong and prominent in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nAfrica bears the primary responsibility for creating\r\nan environment where development is sustainable and\r\nprosperity is ensured. Each Government has to take good\r\ngovernance seriously, ensuring respect for human rights\r\nand the rule of law and strengthening democratization.\r\nAfrican countries must do their utmost to live in an\r\nenvironment of good-neighbourly relations.\r\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize our great\r\nappreciation for the role the OAU has been playing in\r\ndetermining its responsibilities and in defining a common\r\nvision of the future of the African continent. We are\r\nlooking forward to closely cooperating with the OAU, and\r\nwe encourage the strengthening of its ties with the United\r\nNations so as to bring the expertise and political weight\r\nof both organizations together in order to best face the\r\nchallenges of the next millennium.\r\nMr. Gambari (Nigeria): In my capacity as the\r\nChairman of the Group of African States for the month of\r\nOctober 1998, I have the honour to address the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-third session on this agenda item on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). Please allow me at\r\nthe outset to express the appreciation of the group of\r\nambassadors of the OAU at the United Nations for the\r\nSecretary-General’s excellent report on the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity.\r\nThe relationship between the United Nations and the\r\nOAU is a positive one, in line with provisions of Chapter\r\nVIII, Articles 52 to 54, of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, which recognize the relevance and indeed the\r\nimportance of proximity and the familiarity of regional\r\norganizations with the local situation and environment of\r\nconflicts or potential conflicts. Accordingly, the Charter\r\nencourages consultations between regional organizations\r\nand the United Nations as partners in progress in the\r\nmutual search for international peace and security.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nAlthough the Security Council has primary\r\nresponsibility, for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, as mandated by the United Nations Charter,\r\nthe fact is that the OAU has a comparative advantage in\r\nassisting with the prevention, management and resolution of\r\nconflicts in our continent, Africa. OAU member States are\r\nnearer to conflict situations in the continent; they have\r\ngreater understanding of the causes of African conflicts;\r\nand they tend to exhibit more political will to find solutions\r\nto the problems faced by the African continent.\r\nSince its inception, the OAU has striven to promote\r\ngreater understanding and good neighbourliness between\r\nand among member States. The organization has also been\r\nconsistent in its endeavour to prevent conflicts and achieve\r\nthe peaceful resolution of local conflicts while working\r\nclosely with the United Nations Security Council. In recent\r\nyears, much has been done to further improve the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OAU,\r\nespecially in the political, social, economic, technical and\r\ncultural areas, which are also relevant to conflict prevention\r\nprospects in Africa.\r\nConflict prevention holds the key to the maintenance\r\nof peace and security in Africa and perhaps elsewhere in\r\nthe world. However, it remains a big challenge both for\r\nregional organizations like the OAU and for the United\r\nNations. That is because without absolute vigilance, the\r\nearly signs of impending danger could easily escape our\r\nnotice. It is with such an awareness that the United Nations\r\nand the OAU have developed and continue to fine-tune\r\ncommon indicators for early warning and joint training of\r\nstaff in the field of conflict prevention.\r\nPreventive diplomacy, disarmament as regards small\r\narms and the preventive deployment of troops to areas of\r\nsimmering tension are all areas being seriously explored\r\nand considered in an effort to further reinforce the\r\ncooperation between the OAU and the United Nations.\r\nWhere conflicts have already degenerated into\r\nviolence, the OAU, in consultation with the United Nations,\r\nsteps in to prevent further escalation, using its peacekeeping\r\nfacilities. This approach is sometimes exercised through the\r\nsubregional groupings such as the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC).\r\nThe OAU indeed plays a complementary role to the\r\nSecurity Council in the mutual task of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. It is therefore imperative\r\nthat the United Nations subsequently increase logistic and\r\nfinancial support to the OAU and other regional and\r\nsubregional organizations in order to enable them to\r\nbecome even more effective partners with the United\r\nNations in their joint tasks and objectives. This is the way\r\nforward to successfully address the immense obstacles to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn this regard, the United Nations should continue to\r\nassist the OAU in strengthening its Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution in\r\nAfrica. Moreover, the United Nations should ensure the\r\neffective implementation by Member States as well as by\r\nthe United Nations system as a whole of the\r\nrecommendations of the recent report by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the causes of conflict and promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa.\r\nThe United Nations Special Committee on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations, which is chaired by my\r\ncountry, Nigeria, has been working closely with the\r\nAfrican Group as a whole at the United Nations in order\r\nto achieve the common goals of the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts. The OAU\r\nmember States, we must continue to emphasize, send\r\ntroops, provide force commanders and dutifully pay their\r\nassessed contribution for United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations, in spite of their own often very limited\r\nfinancial resources.\r\nThe promotion of a culture of peace, tolerance and\r\nharmonious relationships within and between States is\r\nimportant to the creation of stability and security in\r\nAfrica. A committed and dedicated effort to pursue\r\neconomic development is undoubtedly a prerequisite for\r\npeace and stability in Africa. In this regard, we welcome\r\nthe contributions of the African Development Bank\r\n(ADB) and the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)\r\nto the work of the OAU/ADB/ECA joint secretariat, and\r\nof the United Nations agencies working in Africa which\r\nare involved in efforts to help translate into reality the\r\nobjectives of the Treaty Establishing the African\r\nEconomic Community.\r\nIndeed, the entire United Nations system, as well as\r\nthe States Members of the United Nations, are urged to\r\nextend their support for the operation of the African\r\nEconomic Community and at the same time to adopt\r\nappropriate measures to ensure the effective\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF),\r\nin particular with regard to economic reforms. These\r\ninvolve the effective mobilization and efficient utilization\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nof domestic resources, the promotion of the private sector\r\nand foreign direct investment, the intensification of the\r\ndemocratic process and the strengthening of civil society,\r\nthe environment and development, resource flows, the\r\nsolution of Africa’s debt problem, trade facilitation and\r\nmarket access, the diversification of African economies, the\r\nimprovement of the physical and institutional infrastructures\r\nand social and human resource development, and, last but\r\nnot least, women in development.\r\nFinally, we of the African Group support the draft\r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization of African Unity that will be considered\r\nby the General Assembly. We believe that both\r\norganizations should increase the frequency of their\r\nconsultations in order to enable them to maximize the\r\nachievement of their joint objectives while avoiding\r\nunnecessary duplication of both efforts and resources.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French): My\r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made by\r\nBurkina Faso on behalf of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and by Nigeria on behalf of the Group of\r\nAfrican States.\r\nFor my delegation, consideration of agenda item 35,\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity” is of particular importance,\r\nbecause since 1960 Africa has been at the heart of the\r\nconcerns of the international community and therefore has\r\nbeen in the forefront of the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nThis interest in Africa certainly derives from the\r\ngeopolitical situation of the continent and from the diversity\r\nof political and economic problems confronting the African\r\ncountries, but also from the huge and so far unexplored\r\npotentials which make this continent a zone of opportunity\r\nand growth for the future.\r\nThanks to the courageous joint actions of the African\r\nleaders and their peoples, Africa is rediscovering stability,\r\nwhich is reaffirmed and consolidated through the will to\r\nfocus on prevention and settlement of conflicts and the\r\ndevelopment of the continent. In these areas, the OAU is\r\nplaying an ever-growing role, particularly through its\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution and the involvement of regional organizations.\r\nIn the economic field, struggling against poverty,\r\nproviding fundamental social services, dealing with\r\ndemographic pressure and pursuing the process of regional\r\neconomic integration have all been part of the efforts to lay\r\nthe groundwork for sustainable economic growth in\r\nAfrica.\r\nAll these efforts and all of these gains on the march\r\ntoward the peace and development of Africa have been\r\nmade possible through the multifaceted cooperation which\r\nAfrica has with the United Nations in various fields.\r\nToday, the entire international community shares the\r\nconcept that the best way to ensure peace and security for\r\nAfrica is, without question, the advancement of\r\nsustainable development on the continent. Without peace,\r\nsecurity and stability, development is merely hollow\r\nrhetoric, and without development, peace can only be\r\nfragile.\r\nThis approach adopted by the United Nations forms\r\nthe foundation for the new United Nations agenda for the\r\neconomic social development of Africa for the 1990s. It\r\nis at present being implemented in a concerted fashion by\r\nthe countries of Africa and the operational bodies in the\r\nUnited Nations within the framework of the United\r\nNations System-wide Special Initiative for Africa.\r\nMy delegation believes that the status of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the OAU and the\r\nLeague of Arab States and their observer missions to the\r\nUnited Nations should be reconsidered to allow these\r\nthree organizations to enjoy the privileges and immunities\r\nwhich are essential for the official exercise of their\r\nresponsibilities. It is my delegation’s view that this\r\nquestion should be considered in particular by the\r\nCommittee on Relations with the Host Country in the\r\nlight of Article 105 of the Charter and in the light of\r\naccepted practice in certain host countries.\r\nIn conclusion, the numerous challenges confronting\r\nAfrica demand time, energy and appropriate\r\ncomprehensive responses from the United Nations, from\r\nits system and from the entire international community.\r\nTo that end, and through effective cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the OAU substantive progress has\r\nbeen made in the right direction. For this reason my\r\ndelegation would like to appeal to Member States to\r\nsupport the draft resolution on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): My delegation welcomes\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity”, contained in document A/53/419.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is grateful to note that\r\nefforts are being made to implement the provisions of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations concerning regional\r\narrangements, which set forth the basic principles of\r\ngoverning their activities and for establishing the framework\r\nfor cooperation with the United Nations in the area of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Evidently,\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) has been enhanced\r\nand fruitful over the years since the signing of the\r\nagreement in 1965.\r\nAs stated in the report, the Secretaries-General of the\r\ntwo organizations have met and consulted in a number of\r\nareas. This is a commendable effort on their part, in view\r\nof the many problems Africa still faces. These persistent\r\nproblems vary from economic and social difficulties to a\r\nnumber of conflicts both within and among nation-States.\r\nThe involvement of the Department of Political Affairs\r\nin the areas of international peace and security is pivotal in\r\ncontributing to one of the major aspirations of the OAU,\r\nwhich is to ensure the sustainable development of a\r\npeaceful Africa. The establishment of a United Nations\r\nliaison office with the OAU in Addis Ababa will further\r\nstrengthen cooperation between the two organizations. My\r\ndelegation is also encouraged to note that the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs has seconded a staff\r\nmember to the liaison office. For this reason, the OAU will\r\nnow be better informed of all United Nations actions in the\r\nhumanitarian field.\r\nAfrica’s pursuit of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building, including post-conflict peace-building,\r\nwill be better articulated by the collective efforts of the\r\nCentral Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution, the OAU Conflict\r\nPrevention Unit and the United Nations through its liaison\r\noffice.\r\nMay I briefly recall that Swaziland supports the\r\nrevitalization of the Regional Centre for Peace and\r\nDisarmament in Africa. We believe that the Centre has an\r\nimportant role to play in promoting confidence-building\r\nmeasures at the regional level, thereby encouraging progress\r\nin the area of sustainable development. There is a need\r\ntherefore to provide the necessary resources to enable the\r\nnewly appointed Director to strengthen the activities and\r\nprogrammes of the Centre.\r\nFurthermore, the Kingdom of Swaziland is\r\nappreciative of the efforts and involvement of the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights, particularly with respect to the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community. The High Commissioner’s\r\ninitiative in the formulation, implementation and\r\nevaluation of projects on human rights, democracy and\r\nthe rule of law will be of benefit to the countries in\r\nsouthern Africa to which a human rights resource person\r\nhas been assigned.\r\nCooperation in the field of economic and social\r\ndevelopment remains pivotal for Africa. The participation\r\nof the Office of the Special Coordinator for Africa and\r\nthe Least Developed Countries in the OAU summit held\r\nat Ouagadougou in June 1998 was yet another positive\r\ndemonstration of commitment to the quest for the\r\neconomic and social development of African countries.\r\nFurthermore, we commend the efforts and involvement of\r\nthe Economic Commission for Africa, of United Nations\r\nfunds and programmes and of other agencies. Here I\r\nwould mention the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Environment Programme,\r\nthe World Food Programme, the United Nations Centre\r\nfor Human Settlements, the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development, the International\r\nLabour Organization, the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World\r\nHealth Organization, the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme, the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Intellectual\r\nProperty Organization, among many others.\r\nStill on the subject of economic and social\r\ndevelopment, much more effort is still needed to ensure\r\nthat poverty is alleviated in Africa. To this end, a number\r\nof commitments have been made, but unfortunately these\r\nefforts have not met with positive results.\r\nThe progress report of the Secretary-General, entitled\r\n“Mobilization of additional resources for African\r\ndevelopment: a study on overall resource flows to Africa”\r\nand contained in document A/53/390/Add.1, gives a clear\r\nand analytical picture of the prevailing situation. It was\r\nevident in 1991, when the General Assembly approved\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s that there was a need to mobilize new\r\nand additional resources in this area. Seven years later,\r\nhowever, the situation has only become more intense.\r\nThis greater need calls for even more urgent action in\r\naddressing all the problems besetting Africa.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nPoverty in Africa persists, foreign debt is still a major\r\nproblem, the domestic savings rate has stagnated, official\r\ndevelopment assistance is on the decline and private capital\r\nflows remain small. This is the situation Africa is faced\r\nwith. Evidently, the situation is unlikely to change for the\r\nbetter in the foreseeable future unless there is renewed\r\npolitical will and commitment from the international\r\ncommunity. Africa’s growth rates need to be substantially\r\nhigher than they are at present, and additional resources\r\nmust therefore be mobilized.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation reiterates the importance\r\nof retaining this item on the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly annually. Recalling previously adopted\r\nresolutions, we would like to state that the draft resolution\r\nto be submitted to the Assembly at a later date will further\r\nenhance cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOAU, and we shall fully support its adoption.\r\nMr. Hachani (Tunisia) (interpretation from French):\r\nMy country endorses the statements made earlier in the\r\ndebate by the representative of Burkina Faso on behalf of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and by the\r\nrepresentative of Nigeria on behalf of the Group of African\r\nStates. My delegation wishes to address a few additional\r\npoints on the item entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity”. The\r\nimportance of this item is steadily growing because of the\r\npriority the United Nations now gives to Africa and because\r\nof the special responsibility of the United Nations towards\r\nthe African continent.\r\nI should like to underscore my delegation’s interest in\r\nstrengthening cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization of African Unity. I welcome what has\r\nbeen achieved thus far through that cooperation. I want also\r\nto pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts to assist us\r\nin Africa to promote peace, security and development in\r\nour continent. The Secretary-General’s report on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity describes the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations and its agencies in that connection and the\r\nprogress that has been made.\r\nMr. Filippi Balestra (San Marino), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe international community’s present interest in\r\nAfrica is in line with the urgent appeals made over the\r\nyears in many international and regional forums by my\r\ncountry and its President, His Excellency Mr. Zine El\r\nAbidine Ben Ali. Africa is determined to take charge of\r\nits own fate, relying first and foremost on its own\r\ncapacities and on inter-African solidarity and cooperation.\r\nBut it needs the support and solidarity of the international\r\ncommunity in view of the major challenges it must\r\novercome, including those posed by war, by poverty and\r\nby disease. These challenges can be tackled only with\r\nresolute international action and in close consultation with\r\nthe African States and with the Organization of African\r\nUnity, which is the proper framework for cooperation\r\nwith Africa.\r\nWe welcome the tradition of consultations that has\r\nbeen established between the Secretaries-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and of the Organization of African Unity,\r\nand we hail their initiative to meet twice a year, along\r\nwith their senior advisers, to discuss priority areas of\r\ncooperation and to coordinate their efforts. That initiative\r\nand the establishment of a United Nations liaison office\r\nwith the Organization of African Unity will help\r\nstrengthen cooperation between the two organizations and\r\nensure coordination in the implementation of the various\r\nprogrammes and activities that relate to Africa. Moreover,\r\nthe decision of the Security Council to convene\r\nministerial meetings every two years to assess progress in\r\npromoting peace and security in Africa reflects the\r\nheightened importance the Council attaches to that\r\ncontinent.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity in the field of the\r\nmaintenance of peace has yielded encouraging results.\r\nHere, building the capacity of the OAU Mechanism for\r\nConflict Prevention, Management and Resolution is of\r\nparticular importance in view of the growing number of\r\nsituations it has been called upon to address since its\r\nestablishment. While the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security is principally the responsibility of the\r\nUnited Nations, regional organizations can — as the\r\nexperience of the Organization of African Unity\r\ndemonstrates — contain hotbeds of regional tension and\r\nmake a significant contribution to the success of United\r\nNations peacekeeping efforts.\r\nIndeed, having achieved such results since its\r\ncreation only a few years ago, and despite its limited\r\nmeans, the Mechanism deserves to be encouraged. The\r\nMechanism reflects the determination of African States to\r\nmake preventive diplomacy a constant feature of the\r\nactivities of the Organization of African Unity aimed at\r\neliminating foci of tension, restoring peace and security,\r\nand bringing reconciliation to the region. In that context,\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nconsolidating coordination between the two organizations\r\nand supporting the Mechanism by providing it with\r\nadequate means will enable the Organization of African\r\nUnity to anticipate and prevent conflicts and to act more\r\nrapidly to contain crises continent-wide.\r\nThe restoration of peace and security in Africa\r\nnecessarily involves eliminating the root causes of the\r\nhotbeds of tension and conflict. The deployment of efforts\r\ntowards sustainable development in Africa is a prerequisite\r\nfor the creation of a climate conducive to the establishment\r\nof peace, security and stability throughout the continent.\r\nThe United Nations plays a key role in this context by\r\ndevising specific programmes in support of the continent’s\r\nefforts in the area of economic and social development and\r\nby mobilizing the required international support, in\r\nparticular on the part of the wealthier countries. In this\r\nregard special attention should be paid to resolving the debt\r\nproblem of African countries.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General touched on a\r\nnumber of activities undertaken jointly between the OAU\r\nand the specialized agencies of the United Nations in the\r\narea of economic and social development. We welcome this\r\ncooperation, and we call for a stepping up of efforts to\r\nharmonize these activities with those undertaken in the area\r\nof the maintenance of peace, in view of the close link\r\nbetween these various topics.\r\nLikewise, we welcome the positive initiative\r\nrepresented by the decision of the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations to organize, in conjunction with the\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization of African Unity,\r\nmeetings with the leaders of the world’s major corporations\r\nto heighten their awareness of the progress made in Africa\r\nand the new investment opportunities that it offers in key\r\nsectors for growth. We hope that this initiative will\r\ncontribute to mobilizing the funds that Africa needs for its\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nIn his report on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica, the Secretary-General advocated a series of actions\r\nin favour of peace, stability and development in Africa.\r\nCoordination with the OAU in implementing these activities\r\nwill heighten their chances of success. Africa has made\r\nsignificant progress towards democracy, the promotion of\r\nhuman rights and economic reform. These advances deserve\r\nthe support of the international community in the context of\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of African States.\r\nMr. Konishi (Japan): The importance of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations,\r\nparticularly in addressing issues of economic development\r\nand conflict prevention, cannot be overemphasized. Japan\r\nsincerely welcomes the emphasis which the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) places on its cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations in these areas.\r\nThe issues of conflict prevention and development in\r\nAfrica are inextricably related. Thus, in considering\r\nconflict prevention and post-conflict economic and social\r\ndevelopment, it is necessary to return to an analysis of the\r\nroot causes of the conflicts and to address the situation in\r\nAfrica by adopting a comprehensive approach that\r\nencompasses the political, economic and social fields.\r\nIn the recognition that peace and development are\r\nclosely related, Japan is taking initiatives which it hopes\r\nwill strengthen the cooperative efforts of the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, particularly the OAU.\r\nFirst, in January the Government of Japan hosted the\r\nTokyo International Conference on Preventive Strategy to\r\ndevise a comprehensive strategy for conflict prevention,\r\ngiving particular attention to the situation in Africa. The\r\nreport of the Tokyo Conference (A/53/63), recommended\r\nmeasures which the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations might take immediately, including those\r\nrelating to the enhancement of Africa’s preventive\r\ncapacity, especially the early warning capability. At the\r\nconference, specific policy proposals related to this area\r\nwere put forward, including suggestions for the promotion\r\nof initiatives by regional organizations, the enhancement\r\nof the operational capabilities of regional institutions, and\r\na personnel training programme by regional organizations.\r\nSecondly, just last week, Japan, together with the\r\nUnited Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa,\r\norganized the second Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development (TICAD II), which was attended by\r\nthe Secretary-General, a number of heads of State or\r\nGovernment of African countries, and representatives of\r\ninternational organizations. The conference concluded\r\nwith the adoption of the Tokyo Agenda for Action\r\nidentifying critical development issues in Africa,\r\narticulating the goals and objectives of efforts to address\r\nthose issues, and encouraging the international community\r\nto cooperate in order to achieve those goals.\r\nThirdly, as mentioned in the policy address of the\r\nForeign Minister of Japan, Mr. Koumura, during TICAD\r\nII, Japan has also been cooperating bilaterally with the\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nOAU. Through our contributions to the OAU Peace Fund,\r\nwe are helping the organization to strengthen its capacity in\r\nconflict prevention and resolution, including establishing the\r\ncomputer network connecting the United Nations, the OAU\r\nand other organizations for early warning of conflicts.\r\nI should also add that, as a non-permanent member of\r\nthe Security Council, Japan has been taking active part in\r\nthe work of following up the recommendations contained in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on Africa, in which the\r\nCouncil adopted a resolution addressing the need for\r\nstrengthening the coordination between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations.\r\nIn closing, I should like on behalf of the Government\r\nof Japan, to commend the initiatives and coordinating\r\nefforts of the OAU in the area of conflict prevention,\r\npeace-building and economic development in Africa. We\r\ntrust that its evolving cooperative relationship with the\r\nUnited Nations will serve as a model for other regional and\r\nsubregional organizations as they address the issues of\r\npeace and development.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): The Norwegian Government\r\nwelcomes the report of the Secretary-General on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nLast year the Secretary-General was requested to\r\nreport to the General Assembly on how this cooperation has\r\nevolved. The report reveals the wide scope of cooperation\r\nbetween the various United Nations institutions and the\r\nOAU. We are especially pleased to note the number of\r\nconcrete steps that have been taken to strengthen this\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe discussion on the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nsecurity and development in Africa showed that recent\r\ndevelopments in parts of Africa are worrying and may\r\nthreaten the stability and future prospects of large parts of\r\nthe continent. Mediation and peacekeeping efforts have\r\nbeen initiated in many cases, and it is crucial that these\r\ninitiatives are coordinated and mutually supportive. Here\r\nthe United Nations must play a leading role, in close\r\ncooperation with the Organization of African Unity and the\r\nsubregional organizations.\r\nWe fully agree with the view that building closer ties\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OAU to enhance the\r\nmutual capacity for preventing and resolving conflicts in\r\nAfrica is particularly important. The regular meetings\r\nbetween the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and\r\nthe OAU to discuss priority areas of cooperation and\r\ncoordination are key elements in this process.\r\nGiven the present number of conflicts on the African\r\ncontinent, we think that the focus on conflict prevention,\r\nearly warning and the capabilities of the United Nations\r\nand the regional organizations to meet these challenges is\r\nparticularly important in the dialogue between the United\r\nNations and the OAU. We welcome the decision by the\r\nDepartment of Political Affairs and the office of the\r\nPermanent Observer to meet on a regular basis in order\r\nto facilitate the coordination of actions and initiatives.\r\nFurthermore, the establishment of a United Nations\r\nliaison office with the OAU in Addis Ababa is an\r\nimportant step in strengthening cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations. We will specifically emphasize the role\r\nof this office in coordinating the various efforts in\r\npreventive diplomacy and peacemaking.\r\nWe also commend the report’s emphasis on\r\ncooperation and coordination between the OAU and the\r\nsubregional organizations, especially with regard to\r\nconflict prevention and regional development. We believe\r\nthat the regular meetings and coordination mechanisms\r\noutlined in the report may be an important step in\r\nensuring better coordination between the United Nations\r\nand its agencies and the subregional organizations. The\r\nOAU should play a key role in this respect.\r\nNorway has for several years contributed financially\r\nto strengthening African capacity in peacekeeping and\r\nconflict prevention. The OAU’s Mechanism for conflict\r\nresolution and the training-for-peace programme in the\r\nSouthern African Development Community region are\r\ntwo examples in this regard. However, the conflicts we\r\nsee in Africa today illustrate the need for increased\r\nassistance in this field. The Norwegian Government is\r\ncommitted to continuing its effort in cooperation with\r\nother partners to further strengthen African capacity in the\r\narea of peacekeeping and conflict prevention.\r\nWe also welcome the efforts by the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs to assist the OAU\r\nin implementing programmes intended to strengthen the\r\ncapacity of African organizations to meet humanitarian\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe United Nations plays a crucial role in promoting\r\neconomic and social development in Africa. Given the\r\nnumber of least developed countries on the continent, it\r\nis important that all parts of the United Nations system\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\npay particular attention to Africa’s development aspirations.\r\nWe have taken note of the activities in the economic\r\nand social fields conducted by the various organizations.\r\nAlthough we are pleased with the level of activity, we need\r\nto emphasize the importance of cooperation and\r\ncoordination both at Headquarters and at the country level.\r\nThere can be no economic development without\r\nhuman development. An integral part of human\r\ndevelopment is respect for all human rights: civil, cultural,\r\neconomic, political and social. We therefore welcome the\r\nproject being implemented by the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights that aims to\r\nstrengthen Africa’s regional mechanism for the promotion\r\nand protection of human rights.\r\nThe OAU has an important role to play in promoting\r\npeace and development in Africa. The call by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Salim Salim for increased support by the United\r\nNations to the OAU and the subregional organizations\r\nshould be given the consideration and the follow-up it\r\ndeserves.\r\nMr. Rubadiri (Malawi): I would like to begin by\r\nassociating myself with the statement delivered by the\r\nrepresentative of Burkina Faso, who spoke on behalf of the\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, contained in document\r\nA/53/419, which provides a detailed outline of the various\r\nareas of collaboration between the United Nations and the\r\nOAU.\r\nMalawi is pleased to note that since the adoption by\r\nthe Assembly almost a year ago of resolution 52/20,\r\ncooperation between the two organizations has steadily\r\nexpanded and strengthened. Continued cooperation in\r\nmatters of peace and security, as well as in the field of\r\neconomic and social development, deserves the importance\r\nthat is being accorded to it. That peace and development\r\nare mutually reinforcing aspects of life is an undeniable fact\r\nof which the international community has long been aware.\r\nConflict, both intra-State and inter-State, is one of the\r\nmajor factors that has reversed hard-won economic gains in\r\na number of African countries. Meagre national resources\r\nare being diverted towards buttressing defence and security\r\nforces. In some instances, conflict has destroyed a country’s\r\ninfrastructure, rendering the national development effort a\r\nwaste. We therefore welcome the emphasis that has been\r\nplaced on collaboration in the prevention and resolution\r\nof conflicts in Africa.\r\nMalawi believes in the primacy of the strategy of\r\nearly warning and conflict prevention, and that conflict\r\nresolution should be a second-best option. The regular\r\nconsultations and exchanges of information taking place\r\nbetween the Secretaries-General of the United Nations\r\nand the OAU are an important development. In addition,\r\nthe United Nations Department of Political Affairs, as\r\noverseer of the programme of cooperation, deserves to be\r\nprovided with ample resources and support in order to\r\nfulfil its mandate.\r\nThe general lack of resources prevalent among\r\nAfrican States has led to much of the continent’s being ill\r\nprepared to deal with natural disaster and emergency\r\nsituations. My Government therefore attaches considerable\r\nimportance to the work being carried out by the Office\r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in\r\nstrengthening capacities for African organizations as well\r\nas building national capacities for disaster and emergency\r\nmanagement.\r\nEqually notable work is being undertaken by other\r\nagencies of the United Nations system in building the\r\nnational capacities of African States in the field of human\r\nrights and good governance. In southern Africa we have\r\nwelcomed the regional human rights resource person\r\nassigned by the High Commissioner for Human Rights to\r\nwork voluntarily with Governments of the region. As a\r\ncountry that is involved in an irreversible process of\r\nconsolidating and strengthening institutions of\r\nparticipatory democracy and the protection of human\r\nrights, among other aspects of good governance, Malawi\r\nappreciates the support of the United Nations system\r\nworking in collaboration with the OAU.\r\nIn the economic and social field the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Conference\r\non Trade and Development and a number of other\r\nagencies have pooled their efforts in a partnership for\r\ndevelopment with African organizations as well as with\r\nindividual Governments. Programmes relating to food\r\nsecurity, control and eventual eradication of disease,\r\neducation and revolutionizing information flow are some\r\nof the areas that are likely to form the basis of an\r\neconomic take-off for the African continent.\r\nWhile my delegation welcomes the existing\r\narrangements for cooperation between the United Nations\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nand the OAU, as outlined in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nwe hope that the trend will continually be strengthened over\r\ntime. The short-term marginalization of the continent,\r\nresulting from the process of globalization and growing\r\ninterdependence, should not serve to undermine the existing\r\npartnership.\r\nBut how can one end without asking the question, who\r\nare all the OAU now? Perhaps Norway has just managed to\r\ngive us part of the answer, and Austria may also have tried\r\nto do so. For sooner or later, as we enter the next century,\r\nthe “O” may drop from the OAU — meaning the\r\n“Organization” part of it — and, like Europe’s dropping the\r\nword “Community”, Africa will become an “African\r\nUnion”. It is this aspect which concerns us, because it\r\ninvolves a number of young people.\r\nThrough its conflicts and displacements of human\r\nbeings, especially women and children, Africa has been\r\nscattered around the world. I am thinking of a number of\r\nyoung men and women who are now scattered around the\r\nworld, either by wars at home — by conflicts — or by\r\nhaving been born abroad of people separated from Africa\r\nby conflict.\r\nI could give a personal example of this. My own\r\nfamily is scattered around the world. I have two sons who\r\nare married in Botswana, three girls who are married in\r\nUganda, one son who is married in Kenya and another son\r\nwho is married in El Segundo, California. All these sons\r\nand daughters are the future of Africa. Just as Norway said\r\nthere could be no progress without human resources, this\r\nmight be another dimension in which the OAU or Africa\r\ncan now work hand in hand not only with the United\r\nNations, but also with those countries which think the same\r\nas we do: that all those who have received knowledge and\r\nlearned skills in countries which now have also become part\r\nof themselves, but not so much a part of Africa, can come\r\nback home and use those skills and that knowledge.\r\nPerhaps all those who have constituted a brain drain from\r\nAfrica because of its conflicts and have benefited as\r\nacademics and as professionals in other countries, can be\r\ngiven a chance to come back to Africa and practise those\r\nskills.\r\nHow can this be done? The United Nations can now\r\nbegin to play a role by asking those who have spoken here\r\nnot only come to vote for Africa but also to come up with\r\ntremendous statements. This I would also call part of our\r\nmoment of seeking this United Nations connection with\r\nAfrica.\r\nFor its part, Malawi is ready to work even more\r\nclosely with both the United Nations system and regional\r\norganizations of the OAU.\r\nMr. Muchetwa (Zimbabwe): I am making this\r\nstatement on behalf of my Ambassador.\r\nMy delegation welcomes this opportunity to\r\ndeliberate on the question of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU). We associate ourselves fully with the statements\r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Burkina Faso\r\nand the Permanent Representative of Nigeria, who spoke\r\non behalf of the Group of African States. I wish to thank\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\ninformative report contained in document A/53/419,\r\nwhich is before the Assembly.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that, since their\r\nmeeting in Harare on 3 June 1997, the Secretaries-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and the OAU, together\r\nwith their advisers, have continued their consultations in\r\nmeetings both in New York and at OAU headquarters in\r\nAddis Ababa. We also welcome and encourage the\r\norganization of annual meetings between the secretariats\r\nof the two organizations, such as the recent one held in\r\nAddis Ababa from 6 to 8 May 1998, to review the\r\nimplementation of existing programmes of cooperation\r\nand to agree on new ones, as well as on follow-up action.\r\nZimbabwe follows with keen interest the\r\nprogrammes of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations and arrangements, in particular\r\nthe biannual meetings between the Secretary-General of\r\nthe United Nations and the heads of regional\r\norganizations and arrangements. We are pleased to note\r\nthat the agenda of the last such meeting, which was held\r\nin New York on 28 and 29 July 1998, centred on\r\ncooperation for conflict prevention, focusing on the\r\nchallenges of early warning and conflict prevention, the\r\ncapabilities of the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations to meet those challenges and practical\r\nmodalities for collaborative interaction between them.\r\nThe importance which Africa attaches to this issue\r\ncannot be overemphasized. We therefore wish to reiterate\r\nour appeal to the United Nations and, through it, to the\r\ninternational community to extend, in concrete terms,\r\nassistance to the OAU Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution. International\r\nsupport for Africa’s efforts, including in the area of\r\ncapacity-building, is needed for Africa’s institutions and\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nmechanisms to play their roles effectively in support of the\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping activities in Africa.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the establishment in April\r\nthis year of the United Nations liaison office with the OAU\r\nin Addis Ababa to strengthen cooperation between the two\r\norganizations. We also note with appreciation the training\r\nassistance given by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme to OAU officers in the Conflict Management\r\nDivision. It is our hope that the international community\r\ncan build upon these initial, but crucial, steps.\r\nAlthough Africa’s economic and social crisis has been\r\nthe subject of various initiatives, the continent’s economic\r\nand social woes have remained unmitigated. Africa’s\r\nsacrificial commitment, at the national level, to economic\r\nreform and restructuring programmes has largely gone\r\nuncomplemented by the requisite international support.\r\nFurthermore, Africa’s endeavours to launch the African\r\nEconomic Community and to revitalize the subregional\r\ngroupings, which are the building blocks and pillars of that\r\nCommunity, continue to be hampered by an unfavourable\r\ninternational environment.\r\nWe in Africa believe in a United Nations which has\r\nmatters of economic and social development at the very\r\ncore of its agenda. We believe that the United Nations is\r\nuniquely placed to outline policy guidelines, mobilize and\r\nadvocate for resources and coordinate the various efforts for\r\neconomic and social development and well-being.\r\nIn this regard, we appreciate the analytical work done\r\nby the Office of the Special Coordinator for Africa and the\r\nLeast Developed Countries to find ways and means of\r\nharmonizing the various initiatives on African development.\r\nWe also welcome the work plan adopted by the joint\r\nsecretariat of the OAU, the Economic Commission for\r\nAfrica and the African Development Bank on major\r\nactivities to be carried out for the launching of the African\r\nEconomic Community up to the year 2000.\r\nWe wish to challenge the international community to\r\ngive priority, not only to the formulation of development\r\ninitiatives on Africa, but also and even more to their\r\noperationalization and implementation. We strongly believe\r\nthat the peace and security that we so ardently seek to\r\nachieve cannot be attained in the conditions of abject\r\npoverty that are prevalent in Africa today. We are\r\nconvinced beyond any measure of doubt that a politically\r\nstable and economically prosperous and vibrant Africa is\r\nbest placed to contribute to greater global peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Mohammed (Ethiopia): At the outset, permit\r\nme to thank the Secretary-General for his report on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). This report, in\r\nconjunction with the report on the causes of conflict in\r\nAfrica, is further testimony to the importance and priority\r\nthat the Secretary-General continues to give to the\r\nsituation in Africa in general, and to cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the OAU in particular.\r\nSince our deliberation last year on the agenda item\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, important developments\r\nhave taken place in Africa. Some of these developments\r\nwere, indeed, positive and encouraging. However, the\r\noverall situation in the continent, especially in the areas\r\nof peace and security, has remained precarious and even\r\nworsened in some instances. This state of affairs has, in\r\nturn, highlighted further the need for enhanced\r\ncooperation and coordination between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of African Unity.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General provides\r\nvaluable information on the measures taken with a view\r\nto enhancing cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OAU. We welcome these steps.\r\nThe institutionalization of regular consultation\r\nmechanisms between the two secretariats and the follow-\r\nup procedures put in place to coordinate the efforts of the\r\ntwo organizations are, indeed, commendable.\r\nNeedless to say, cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations in the maintenance of\r\npeace and security is essential and in accordance with\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. In this\r\nregard, we note with satisfaction the actions taken by the\r\nUnited Nations over the past year, including the\r\nestablishment of a United Nations Liaison Office with the\r\nOAU. The Office is expected to operate under a clear\r\nmandate and terms of reference that will enable it to play\r\nthe role assigned to it, especially in facilitating the\r\nexchange of information and in serving as a means of\r\neffective communication and interaction between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nFurthermore, the activities of the various United\r\nNations offices and agencies, such as the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nand others, should be closely coordinated with that of the\r\nOAU. Such cooperation and coordination should aim at\r\nstrengthening Africa’s capacity and mechanisms, in\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nparticular through the mobilization and provision of the\r\nnecessary financial and technical assistance to enhance\r\nOAU’s institutional capacity.\r\nAs rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport on the causes of conflict in Africa, United Nations\r\nsupport for regional peace initiatives is indispensable. In\r\nthis connection, we wish to commend once again the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff for their continued efforts\r\nto closely coordinate the activities of the United Nations\r\nwith those of the OAU and other regional organizations in\r\nthe search for peace in the various conflict areas in Africa.\r\nIn our own subregion, we are particularly pleased to note\r\nthat the United Nations and its various agencies and\r\nprogrammes are working closely with our subregional\r\norganization, the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD), in support of our efforts and\r\ninitiatives, especially on the situations in Somalia and the\r\nSudan. It is our earnest hope that such cooperation and\r\nsupport will be further strengthened and enhanced.\r\nEthiopia, as a country mandated by the OAU and\r\nIGAD to assist in the search for peace in Somalia, attaches\r\ngreat importance to the role and support of the United\r\nNations in bringing about a lasting solution to the crisis in\r\nSomalia. Our experience over the past few years has clearly\r\nshown that coordination of the efforts of all external actors\r\nand the need to avoid the proliferation of initiatives are\r\nessential factors for the success of the efforts for peace in\r\nSomalia. In this respect, the second international\r\nconsultative conference on Somalia, held in Addis Ababa\r\non 20 October 1998, has been particularly useful to the\r\nefforts to establish a mechanism for the coordination of all\r\nefforts for peace in Somalia. We are confident that the\r\nUnited Nations will remain engaged in the search for peace\r\nin Somalia and continue to assist the efforts of the OAU\r\nand IGAD.\r\nIn the economic and social fields, we note with\r\nsatisfaction the important role that the various United\r\nNations agencies and programmes, and most particularly the\r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA),\r\ncontinue to play in cooperation with the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity. In this regard, we welcome the adoption of\r\na work plan by the joint secretariat of the ECA, the OAU\r\nand the African Development Bank (ADB) on major\r\nactivities to be carried out for launching the operation of\r\nthe African Economic Community up to 2000.\r\nLikewise, my delegation commends the important\r\ncontributions that other United Nations agencies and\r\nprogrammes, such as the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund\r\n(UNFPA), the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n(FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), among others,\r\ncontinue to make in cooperation with the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity. The efforts and activities of the United\r\nNations system should focus, first and foremost, on\r\npriority areas, as well as on capacity-building and long-\r\nterm development in Africa. The momentum for enhanced\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and OAU needs\r\nto be maintained in order to implement the political and\r\neconomic agenda identified by African countries. At the\r\nsame time, we wish to extend our appreciation to those\r\nUnited Nations agencies and programmes, such as the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, that have\r\nalready taken steps to focus their activities on institutional\r\ncapacity-building and the promotion of economic\r\ncooperation and integration in Africa.\r\nThe past few years have clearly shown that\r\ncooperation and coordination between regional\r\norganizations and the United Nations have become\r\nindispensable instruments in addressing vital issues in the\r\nareas of peace and security, as well as in economic and\r\nsocial development.\r\nWe have witnessed the increasing resort to regional\r\nmechanisms and arrangements to prevent and resolve\r\nregional conflicts in different parts of the world. While\r\nthis trend is indeed welcome, it should be made clear,\r\nhowever, that the role of regional organizations and\r\narrangements cannot be a substitute for the primary role\r\nand responsibility of the United Nations, in particular that\r\nof the Security Council, in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The United Nations\r\nsystem in general, and the Security Council in particular,\r\nshould remain actively engaged and be able to fulfil their\r\nrespective mandates and responsibilities.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to state that Ethiopia, as a host\r\ncountry of the OAU and the ECA, which is the regional\r\narm of the United Nations, is committed to contributing\r\nits part in the efforts to further strengthen and enhance the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity.\r\nMr. Lee See-young (Republic of Korea): My\r\ndelegation wishes to express its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the agenda item under\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nconsideration, which underlines the importance of close\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nDuring this decade, Africa has made great strides\r\ntowards stability, democracy and prosperity. However,\r\narmed conflicts persist in some parts of the continent,\r\nthreatening regional peace and security. These conflicts are\r\ninflicting enormous suffering on innocent civilians by\r\ncausing massive dislocations of people, humanitarian\r\ndistress and serious violations of human rights.\r\nFurthermore, they are destroying the very resources that are\r\nessential for social and economic development. To meet\r\nthese challenges, the international community has so far\r\napplied a vast amount of energy and resources, through the\r\nUnited Nations system and the other humanitarian\r\norganizations, often in cooperation with regional and\r\nsubregional organizations.\r\nWe believe, however, that further efforts should be\r\nmade to enhance cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations, the Organization of African Unity and\r\nsubregional organizations. We are encouraged by the\r\nincreasing cooperation between the Security Council and\r\nthe OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\r\nand Resolution, the recent success of the United Nations-\r\nEconomic Community of West African States joint\r\nundertaking in regional peacekeeping and the closer\r\nconsultations and exchange of information between the\r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and of the OAU\r\nand their advisers.\r\nIn our view, such cooperation enables the United\r\nNations to draw on the local expertise and resources of\r\nregional organizations. The United Nations and regional\r\norganizations should also concentrate more on crisis\r\nprevention. As we know, it is always less costly to prevent\r\ncrises than to react to them. In this vein, we welcome the\r\nestablishment of the Trust Fund for Preventive Action of\r\nthe Secretary-General, and I take this opportunity to express\r\nmy Government’s willingness to continue to contribute to\r\nit. We hope that this Fund will be further expanded through\r\nincreased contributions so as to enable the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to take preventive action in areas of potential\r\nconflict, including in Africa.\r\nThe international community also needs to continue\r\nhelping regional organizations strengthen their capacity for\r\npeacekeeping. Capacity-building is important because it not\r\nonly enables a swifter response to conflict, but also\r\nultimately empowers African countries to resolve regional\r\nproblems by themselves. In this regard, we welcome\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1197 (1998) of September\r\n1998, which provides for ways and means to improve\r\ncontinued cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOAU. We support the early implementation of these\r\nsteps.\r\nSince the 1970s, the Government of the Republic of\r\nKorea has always given high priority to the promotion of\r\ncooperative relations with African countries. More\r\nrecently, we have participated in a number of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations in Africa, including the\r\nsecond United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM\r\nII), the third United Nations Angola Verification Mission\r\n(UNAVEM III) and the United Nations Mission for the\r\nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). Our\r\nattachment to the peace and prosperity of Africa became\r\neven stronger during our recent two-year involvement as\r\na member of the Security Council.\r\nWe also stress that close cooperation in the field of\r\neconomic and social development is fundamental for\r\nlong-term peace and prosperity in Africa. The Republic of\r\nKorea will continue to focus its development cooperation\r\npolicy on Africa through increased provision of human\r\nresources, through development programmes and through\r\ngrants in the framework of official development\r\nassistance. In this connection, my Government has taken\r\nthe initiative to organize, in cooperation with the United\r\nNations, the Forum on Asia-Africa Cooperation in Export\r\nPromotion, to take place from 14-16 December this year.\r\nWe expect that Forum to contribute to the facilitation of\r\nprivate sector development in Africa and the promotion of\r\nAsia-Africa interregional cooperation.\r\nIf we are to fulfil our responsibility for international\r\npeace and security, we should give higher priority to the\r\nAfrican continent. The Republic of Korea reaffirms its\r\ndetermination to continue to make a positive contribution\r\nin this process.\r\nMr. Yacoubou (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nWe have recently witnessed an unleashing of the forces\r\nof nature in the form of hurricanes, bringing with them\r\nmaterial damage and a great loss of human life. We are\r\nliving in an interdependent world in which a phenomenon\r\nat one end of the earth rapidly gives rise to upheavals and\r\nrepercussions at the other. My delegation would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to convey its profound sympathy to\r\nthe States and peoples affected by these phenomena, the\r\nterrible works of nature.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nBearing in mind such events, I take the floor to speak\r\nabout agenda item 34, on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nwhich is the subject of the report of the Secretary-General\r\nin document A/53/419. The report provides an account of\r\nthe efforts undertaken in the context of cooperation between\r\nthe two organizations since the last session of the General\r\nAssembly. These include the creation within the OAU in\r\nAddis Ababa of a United Nations liaison office for\r\npreventive action, peacemaking and peace-building and the\r\ndemocratization process in Africa; the institutionalization of\r\nbiannual meetings in New York and Addis Ababa for\r\nexchanging ideas and information between the two\r\norganizations; regular meetings between the OAU and\r\nvarious entities of the United Nations system to evaluate the\r\nimplementation of ongoing programmes of cooperation and\r\nto prepare new ones; and meetings with the Group of\r\nAfrican States in New York to brief them on priority issues.\r\nWe should add to that list the provision by the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights of advisory services and technical assistance to the\r\nGovernments of African countries, to the OAU and to the\r\nAfrican Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights in\r\npromoting and protecting human rights.\r\nThe framework strategy with three components\r\ndeveloped by the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights is a significant instrument,\r\nand we should ensure that it is implemented methodically\r\nand efficiently.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights is, in\r\nmy delegation’s view, a key element in preventing conflicts\r\nand building peace in Africa, for, as the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Benin stated in the\r\ngeneral debate,\r\n“there is no more urgent task today than replacing the\r\nculture of violence and war...by the culture of peace.\r\nWe believe that the foremost duty...continues to be the\r\npromotion of peace and all its values and the\r\nbehaviour that underpins and strengthens it.”\r\n(A/53/PV.20)\r\nThe report before us indicates that in realizing this\r\naim, within the United Nations system it is the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) that has the\r\nresponsibility for mobilizing the necessary resources. I\r\nshould like to urge UNDP to spare no effort in carrying out\r\nthis task, which is an essential prerequisite for attaining the\r\nstrategy’s targets. I should also like to appeal to donor\r\ncountries to contribute to the realization of this project by\r\nmaking contributions of all kinds of resources.\r\nMy delegation commends the initiative of\r\ndispatching to southern Africa a regional human rights\r\nspecialist who, in coordination with the resident\r\nrepresentatives of UNDP in the subregion, is responsible\r\nfor assisting in the elaboration, execution and evaluation\r\nof projects in the areas of human rights, democracy and\r\nthe rule of law. In view of the importance of the issue,\r\nBenin takes the view that the sending to other subregions\r\nof Africa of human rights specialists would considerably\r\ncontribute to the promotion of the values of peace.\r\nThe quest for peace in Africa requires a\r\ncomprehensive, concerted and resolute approach that\r\naddresses the promotion of democracy and respect for\r\nhuman rights as well as economic and social\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, my delegation welcomes the\r\nwork of the Development Assistance Committee, which\r\nhas led to the identification of five priority areas: an\r\nincrease in official development assistance; the conversion\r\nof the bilateral debts of the poorest African countries;\r\nliberalization of access to the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative; the simplification of\r\nconditions for African products’ access markets in\r\nindustrialized countries; and an increase in private direct\r\ninvestment in Africa.\r\nVarious other initiatives have been launched to assist\r\nAfrica, as an expression of our shared desire to see the\r\ncontinent emerge from its marginalization. In order to\r\nachieve their purposes, not only must these initiatives be\r\nharmonized, in keeping with the pertinent\r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Africa, but partial targets must be set, to be\r\nachieved step by step and sector by sector, and regular\r\nevaluations of implementation must be scheduled.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation takes the view that, in\r\nkeeping with the results of the second Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development, which took place\r\nlast week, the improvement of the situation in Africa\r\nthrough effective conflict management, peacemaking and\r\npeace-building and the elimination of poverty remains\r\nprimarily the responsibility of the continent. However, the\r\nassistance of the international community and of the\r\ndevelopment partners is of the greatest importance.\r\nI continue to believe that, as in the past, Africa will\r\ndo its part.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nLastly, my delegation congratulates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on his efforts in managing the affairs of the\r\nOrganization and associates itself with the statements of\r\nBurkina Faso and Nigeria made on behalf of the OAU and\r\nthe African Group.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 2011 (XX) of 11 October 1965, I now\r\ncall on the Observer for the Organization of African Unity.\r\nMr. Kébé (Organization of African Unity)\r\n(interpretation from French): Allow me first of all to\r\nextend to the President, on behalf of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), my warmest and most heartfelt\r\ncongratulations on his accession to the presidency of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt is a humbling honour to speak from this rostrum of\r\nthe cooperation between the OAU and the United Nations.\r\nIt is indeed a formidable honour, especially since I follow\r\nthe representative of the current Chairman of the OAU and\r\nthe Chairman of the African Group in addressing the\r\nAssembly. They have referred, with relevance and clarity,\r\nto the major themes of the cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OAU and have emphasized the focal points\r\nand areas of priority and have proposed new ideas. I fully\r\nassociate myself with all their comments.\r\nTherefore, and without denying the highly instructive\r\nvalue of repetition, I wish to assure the Assembly that,\r\ninsofar as possible, I shall restrict my comments to areas\r\nwhich I consider to be of imperative necessity, with the\r\nunderstanding that all the areas of cooperation between the\r\nOAU and the United Nations are essential.\r\nI shall begin by welcoming that cooperation — which\r\nI would describe as outstanding from all points of view —\r\nby thanking the United Nations Secretary-General for his\r\ncontinuous efforts to raise cooperation between our two\r\ninstitutions to an ever higher level and by congratulating\r\nhim on the complete and precise report which is the subject\r\nof our debate.\r\nThe road we have come down together since the\r\ncreation of this cooperation in 1965 is a long one, and our\r\naccomplishments are highly significant. But since perfection\r\nalways lies out of reach, we need to be responsive to\r\nchanging times and new events as we set about our joint\r\ntask.\r\nThe fundamental changes experienced by the world\r\ntoday, as well as the multiplicity and complexity of the\r\nserious problems experienced by Africa, require a\r\nstrengthening of the existing framework of cooperation\r\nand the identification of new approaches.\r\nAs for strengthening the already existing framework,\r\nwe should point out the periodic high-level meetings\r\nbetween the Secretaries-General of the two Organizations\r\nduring the summits of the OAU and the sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. These periodic meetings are\r\ncomplemented by ad hoc meetings whenever\r\ncircumstances require or allow for them. At these\r\nmeetings, the philosophy of cooperation is reaffirmed,\r\nprincipal themes are clarified, major orientations are\r\nredefined and guidelines are redrawn.\r\nI wish also to mention the annual meetings of the\r\ntwo secretariats, held alternately at New York and at\r\nAddis Ababa, at which programmes for cooperation are\r\nfinalized and adopted. But we see that, in practice,\r\nunforeseen difficulties always arise between the adoption\r\nof a programme and its implementation; the political will\r\nof leaders, however often reaffirmed, is insufficient to\r\nresolve these. That is why the two secretariats decided at\r\ntheir last meeting, held in May 1998 at Addis Ababa, to\r\nconvene a follow-up and review session every six months.\r\nI wish here to hail the recent decision by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations to open a liaison office\r\nwith the OAU at Addis Ababa; this will fill a gap that\r\nhampered the effective follow-up of decisions that had\r\nbeen taken.\r\nAmong the areas of cooperation that I would qualify\r\nas being of the greatest urgency is that of conflict\r\nprevention, which since 1993 the OAU has made the\r\nhighest of its priorities with the creation of the\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution. Because it has a presence throughout Africa,\r\nnotably through its specialized agencies, the United\r\nNations unquestionably has a great advantage with respect\r\nto gathering information that it can share with the OAU,\r\nwhich can then be ready to act in a timely manner in\r\nareas of potential conflict. The OAU, however, knows\r\nthat information is merely a tool, but a tool that is\r\nindispensable in the timely political decision-making that\r\nalone can prevent conflicts.\r\nThen there is the maintenance of peace. We would\r\nall agree that here the regional organizations must be\r\nallowed to play a pivotal role in conflict situations.\r\nIndeed, satisfactory solutions to some African conflicts\r\ncan be — and, as we have seen, have been — found\r\nthrough regional initiatives. Others, however, are so\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\ncomplex that they require United Nations involvement\r\nbecause they demand vast human, material and financial\r\nresources. Fortunately, wherever such events occur in\r\nAfrica, the OAU and the United Nations have stood side by\r\nside and have harmonized their efforts and pooled their\r\nmeans to find solutions to the problems.\r\nAnother area in which cooperation between the OAU\r\nand the United Nations can only benefit African States is\r\nsupport for the process of democratization, the\r\ninstitutionalization of good governance, respect for human\r\nrights, and the establishment of a culture of peace. Here,\r\nAfrican leaders have made significant efforts, which\r\ndeserve the joint support of our two institutions.\r\nI should also mention post-conflict situations, in which\r\na climate that has been made healthy is needed for any\r\naction aimed at genuine reconciliation. The OAU has\r\nunambiguously demonstrated its determination to fight\r\nimpunity, by establishing the International Panel of Eminent\r\nPersonalities to investigate the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.\r\nFinally, there is the social and humanitarian sphere\r\nwhere, as a result of actual or latent conflicts in Africa, the\r\nexistence of a growing number of refugees and displaced or\r\nrepatriated persons requires more intense cooperation and\r\nbetter coordination between the two organizations. Let me\r\nhere congratulate the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations on his report on protection for humanitarian\r\nassistance to refugees and others in conflict situations,\r\ndocument S/1998/883 of 22 September 1998, which relates\r\nto the protection of refugees and of those engaged in\r\ndelivering assistance.\r\nIn the economic sphere, there is no need to recall that\r\nAfrica remains concerned with the search for permanent\r\nsolutions to problems of economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. In recent years, the African countries have\r\nshown their concern through individual and joint efforts, in\r\nparticular by undertaking radical economic reforms and\r\ncontinent-wide programmes such as the Lagos Plan of\r\nAction, which remains relevant 17 years later, the African\r\nEconomic Community, established in 1991, and the 1995\r\nCairo Agenda for Action: Relaunching Africa’s Socio-\r\neconomic Development.\r\nParallel to these endogenous efforts, the international\r\ncommunity has shown great interest in the campaign against\r\npoverty and in promoting economic growth and\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Here we hail the numerous\r\ninitiatives of the international community in this sphere,\r\nnearly all of them conceived in this Assembly. I mention in\r\nparticular the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), its\r\npredecessor the United Nations Programme of Action for\r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development, the United\r\nNations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa, and the\r\nTokyo International Conference on African Development,\r\nnow in its second stage.\r\nYet everyone knows that these efforts have not yet\r\nyielded the results on which many African countries had\r\ncounted. It is increasingly feared that the improvements\r\ngained through years of economic reforms and social\r\nconstraints of all kinds will be swept away by the\r\nongoing process of globalization. The African countries\r\nhave made an effort to create and consolidate a climate\r\nconducive to development. They have clearly defined\r\ntheir share of the responsibility and have shouldered it as\r\nbest they could. It is the response of the international\r\ncommunity that is overdue in meeting the hopes of\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe phenomenon of globalization is transforming the\r\nworld into a global village — not a term of my own\r\ninvention — characterized by interconnected networks,\r\ncommunications, knowledge and cultures, and by the\r\ninterdependence of economies. Any weakness or\r\nshortcoming in one link in the chain will have an impact\r\non all the other links: here I need only recall the crisis in\r\nAsia.\r\nTo my mind, the principle of solidarity needs to be\r\nreinvented on the global scale with a view to finding\r\nlasting solutions to the problems of Africa’s foreign\r\nindebtedness — which in spite of all the generous and\r\npraiseworthy initiatives, remains a thorny and painful\r\nissue; resolving the matter of increasing the flow of new\r\nand additional resources and of foreign direct investment;\r\nand finding a way to strengthen the competitive capacities\r\nof African countries to enable them to benefit from\r\nagreements concluded in the framework of the Uruguay\r\nRound of multilateral trade negotiations.\r\nThe idea of a world that operates on two levels and\r\nat two speeds, as is the case now, is morally unacceptable\r\nand humanly untenable. The present state of the world\r\nseems to be ahead of human thinking. We need to\r\nreinvent, for human beings of the coming millennium, a\r\n“global village” mentality. There is nothing pejorative in\r\nthis term. Only in this way can the disasters that bloodied\r\nthe first half of the century and the continuing tensions\r\nthat have left their mark on its second half be avoided in\r\nfuture.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nThe United Nations and the OAU are fully aware of\r\nthe extent of these new challenges, and I am pleased to\r\nnote here that they are together working to prepare people\r\nand institutions for the good life in the “village” of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers that a draft resolution on this item will be\r\nsubmitted to the Secretariat at a later date.\r\nAgenda item 23\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/53/275 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.15)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Guyana to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.15.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): I have the honour to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/53/L.15, entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity”, on behalf of the 14 member States of that\r\nCommunity — Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados,\r\nBelize, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nSuriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and my own country,\r\nGuyana. We are pleased and privileged to have the co-\r\nsponsorship of the States named on the document, as well\r\nas of the following countries, which have since asked to\r\njoin the list: Algeria, Bahrain, Belgium, Chile, Colombia,\r\nDenmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan,\r\nLuxembourg, New Zealand, Panama, Papua New Guinea,\r\nPortugal, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nAt the outset, I should like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report contained in document A/53/275 of\r\n18 August 1998 and A/53/275/Add.1 of 16 September\r\n1998. Outlined in the report is the wide range of activities\r\nin which the United Nations and the Caribbean Community\r\nare currently engaged as part of their ever-growing\r\ncooperation. Caribbean Community (CARICOM) States\r\nconsider the relationship between these two institutions to\r\nbe very beneficial to their own development and would\r\nconsequently wish to see it strengthened and expanded.\r\nAlthough CARICOM was granted observer status\r\nonly in 1994, the countries which are members of this\r\nCommunity of nations have had a long and fruitful\r\nrelationship with the United Nations. Many of our States\r\nin fact owe their freedom and independence in good\r\nmeasure to the decolonization campaign undertaken\r\nwithin the Organization in the aftermath of the Second\r\nWorld War. Today, almost six decades later, Caribbean\r\nStates continue to rely on the provisions of the Charter\r\nfor the protection of our hard-won sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity. For us, as small States in a very\r\nuncertain world, the United Nations represents a shield\r\nand buckler against threats to our peace and security.\r\nEqually important, the United Nations has been very\r\ninstrumental over the years in assisting our economic and\r\nsocial development so that we might hope, in the words\r\nof the Charter, to live “in larger freedom”. Its vast\r\nnetwork of functional agencies, including the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and\r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations (FAO), to name just a few, have helped\r\nconsiderably to improve the quality of life for our\r\npeoples. We would therefore wish to fully recognize and\r\nexpress our appreciation for the role which the entire\r\nsystem, and in particular the Department of Economic and\r\nSocial Affairs, has played — and continues to play — in\r\npromoting our welfare.\r\nGiven this established tradition of close cooperation,\r\nit is not surprising that our Community would wish to\r\nenhance its relations with the United Nations. In keeping\r\nwith this desire, CARICOM formalized its observer status\r\nin 1996 and has since established a presence at\r\nHeadquarters in New York. Increasingly, the two\r\norganizations have interacted through an exchange of\r\ninformation and periodic consultations. On occasion, their\r\nrespective Secretaries-General meet to review and build\r\nupon their cooperation. By all accounts, the experience\r\nhas been a very positive and rewarding one for all\r\nconcerned.\r\nAccordingly, the draft resolution that has been\r\nsubmitted for consideration this year seeks to reflect the\r\nachievements over the past two years and to promote\r\neven greater cooperation between the two bodies in the\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nfuture. Reference is thus made in the preambular paragraphs\r\nto the First General Meeting, which was held on 27 and 28\r\nMay 1997 here at the United Nations between\r\nrepresentatives of the Caribbean Community and its\r\nassociated institutions on the one hand, and the United\r\nNations system on the other. That meeting served to affirm\r\nthe need to strengthen the cooperation between the two\r\norganizations in the areas of economic and social\r\ndevelopment and political and humanitarian affairs.\r\nOn that basis, the two parties have explored and\r\ndelineated the areas in which future collaboration could take\r\nplace.\r\nIn its operative portion the draft resolution welcomes\r\nthe convening by the Secretary-General of the Third\r\nMeeting between the United Nations and Regional\r\nOrganizations on 28 and 29 July 1998, with a follow-up\r\nplanned for later this year. CARICOM’s participation in\r\nthis consultative process demonstrates, in our view, the fact\r\nthat under the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter,\r\nevery regional arrangement, no matter how small, can\r\ncontribute to reinforcing international peace and security\r\nthrough the practice of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping\r\nand peace-building. In practical terms, CARICOM countries\r\nhave come together with the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States to restore and support\r\ndemocratic government in our sister State of Haiti and,\r\nmore generally, to buttress the democratic process\r\nthroughout the region.\r\nIn the area of economic and social development, the\r\nUnited Nations has been a major catalyst for developmental\r\nactivities in the Caribbean. With the assistance of friendly\r\nGovernments such as Italy we have been able to undertake\r\nnecessary programmes in the fields of energy and training\r\nto enhance the capability of public administration\r\nthroughout the region. Cooperating with the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the\r\nCaribbean Development and Cooperation Committee and\r\nother regional institutions, CARICOM and the United\r\nNations are working actively to ensure the full\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 and, in particular, the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\r\nSpecifically, the draft resolution urges the specialized\r\nagencies and other organizations and programmes of the\r\nUnited Nations to cooperate with the Secretaries-General of\r\nthe United Nations and CARICOM to initiate, maintain and\r\nincrease exchanges and projects with the Caribbean\r\nCommunity and its associated institutions. Of particular\r\nimportance and interest to us as member States are the\r\nissues of sustainable development, drug-trafficking,\r\nenvironmental protection, education and training, national\r\ndisaster preparedness and, generally, the strengthening of\r\nour weak and fragile economies to deal with the\r\nchallenges arising from the phenomenon of globalization\r\nand from the rapid liberalization of the world economy.\r\nThe continuing cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand CARICOM should therefore be aimed at sensitizing\r\nthe international community to the particular vulnerability\r\nof the small economies of the Caribbean and of the world\r\nto the vagaries of world trade and to the constant cycles\r\nof natural disasters. The donors’ meeting scheduled for\r\nFebruary next year offers a welcome opportunity to\r\nsupport the Programme for the Small Island Developing\r\nStates.\r\nIn sum, the draft resolution before us is no more\r\nthan an indication to the cooperating parties — namely\r\nthe United Nations and CARICOM — as to how they\r\nmay best be able to build on their existing relationship.\r\nThe member States of the Caribbean Community\r\nsincerely hope that not only will the draft resolution be\r\nunanimously adopted, by consensus, but also that its\r\nimplementation will receive the positive and practical\r\nsupport of the entire United Nations system.\r\nThe year ahead will be a very crucial one to the\r\nfuture of the countries of the Caribbean. We will need to\r\ntake stock of what we have been able to do — and\r\nequally important, of what we have not been able to\r\ndo — in terms of promoting the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment. Therefore, when the United Nations and\r\nCARICOM hold their second meeting in February 1999,\r\nwe will look to see how the two institutions can further\r\ncoordinate and maximize their efforts to assist us as\r\nmember Governments in placing our peoples on the path\r\nof solid political, economic and social progress.\r\nMr. Manz (Austria): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries associated with the European Union\r\n— Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,\r\nLatvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia — and the\r\nassociated country Cyprus, as well as the European Free\r\nTrade Association country member of the European\r\nEconomic Area, Norway, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nThe European Union (EU) took note with great\r\ninterest of the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM). We welcome the\r\nintensified cooperation and interaction between CARICOM\r\nand the United Nations in a wide range of areas, including\r\npolitical matters, sustainable development, environmental\r\nprotection, drug control, education and science, economy,\r\ntrade and integration, international law and, last but not\r\nleast, media and information.\r\nIncreased exchange of information between the United\r\nNations system and CARICOM took place in particular\r\nwith respect to conflict prevention, governance, democracy\r\nand civil society issues, and poverty eradication. Joint\r\nefforts continued to promote environmental protection and\r\nenhance disaster response, management and preparedness.\r\nCoordination and cooperation in the context of the 1996\r\nBarbados Plan of Action concerning drug control have been\r\nfurther strengthened. The EU expresses its appreciation of\r\nthese developments.\r\nThis year CARICOM celebrated its twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary. The EU congratulates the Community on its\r\nachievements in the process of regional integration, which\r\nthe EU since 1992 has actively supported, as we consider\r\nit a very important component of our cooperation with\r\nCaribbean States. In the last few years, we have not only\r\nnoted a stronger Caribbean voice in international forums but\r\nalso progress in the joint promotion of exports and growth\r\nin the attraction of investments through the Caribbean\r\nDevelopment Bank.\r\nFurthermore, the EU welcomes the progress in the\r\nimplementation of the CARICOM single market and\r\neconomy, and the further development of CARICOM’s\r\nregional negotiating machinery, as reaffirmed by the\r\nCARICOM heads of Government at their nineteenth\r\nmeeting, held in Saint Lucia this past summer.\r\nThe EU would also like to mention positively the\r\ndevelopment of closer relations within CARICOM with the\r\nRepublic of Haiti and between CARICOM and the\r\nDominican Republic as well as with Cuba as a member of\r\nthe Association of Caribbean States.\r\nIn February 1997, CARIFORUM and the European\r\nCommission signed the Caribbean Regional Indicative\r\nProgram under the Second Financial Protocol of Lomé IV,\r\nproviding further substantial resources for regional projects\r\nin the Caribbean. In addition, considerable means were\r\nmade available to assist in financing a wide range of\r\nprojects in support of the 1996 Barbados Plan of Action\r\nconcerning drug control cooperation and coordination. The\r\nEU continues to be the largest provider of grant aid to the\r\nregion.\r\nBecause the Lomé agreement expires in 2000, the\r\nEU and its partners in CARICOM have started to\r\nconsider the elements of new cooperation agreements. In\r\na post-Lomé process, support for regional integration\r\ninitiatives and for strengthening the capacities of regional\r\norganizations will remain one of the EU’s priorities. In\r\neconomic terms, diversification, economies of scale and\r\nbetter conditions for competition are factors that may\r\npromote economic growth and development.\r\nWe recognize that in reacting to new economic\r\nchallenges small island developing States may face\r\nspecific problems, caused by a shortage of suitable\r\ninfrastructure, small domestic markets and geographical\r\nremoteness from neighbours and international markets,\r\nwhich constitute constraints on economic growth. Small\r\nisland developing States are particularly exposed to\r\nexternal economic shocks and face marginalization in an\r\nincreasingly globalized world economy. They are also\r\nparticularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of global\r\nclimate change and thus need assistance in adapting to\r\nsuch changes. The apparent growing strength and\r\nfrequency of tropical storms, such as the recent hurricane\r\nGeorges, and the consequences of El Niño phenomena\r\nhave resulted not only in massive loss of human life, but\r\nalso in significant damage to ecological and economic\r\nresources and human settlements in the past decade. In\r\nrecognizing this specific situation, in 1994 in Barbados\r\nthe international community endorsed a programme of\r\naction for the sustainable development of such States. We\r\nare looking forward to the full appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of this programme in 1999, culminating\r\nin a special session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe EU reaffirms its commitment to continue\r\nproviding financial and technical assistance in support of\r\nCARICOM’s own efforts to cope with the various\r\nchallenges. On top of bilateral contributions, within the\r\nframework of the Lomé Convention, the European\r\nCommunity has allocated over one billion ECU in aid for\r\nthe period 1996-2000 to island developing States in\r\nAfrica, the Caribbean and the Pacific.\r\nThe European Union is committed to further\r\ndeveloping and strengthening its relationship with the\r\ncountries of the Caribbean. In the years to come, we will\r\nwork together on a new partnership, through qualitative\r\nprogress in political dialogue, economic relations and\r\ncooperation. In this connection, we will continue to attach\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nparticular importance to the Caribbean Community and its\r\never closer links and interaction with the United Nations.\r\nThe members of the European Union have therefore\r\nsponsored the draft resolution before us, which we hope\r\nwill be adopted by consensus.\r\nMs. Aguiar (Dominican Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): I am honoured to make this statement as\r\nChairperson of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates for the month of October.\r\nThe history of the Caribbean region has been\r\ncharacterized by survival through resistance to various\r\nforms of adversity and by willingness to face difficult\r\nsituations. For this reason, the commonly held perception of\r\nthe Caribbean region as a theatre of operations where\r\nnations struggle to conquer territories and to open markets,\r\nbut also as a region where the terrible forces of nature\r\nmake themselves felt with tenacious and methodical\r\nregularity — all this has become part of our history as well.\r\nThe world events of the last 20 years have been very\r\nmeaningful for the Caribbean’s prospects of cooperation\r\nand development. These events have also brought about\r\nfundamental changes in the areas of politics, economics and\r\ntrade relations and in international organizations themselves.\r\nOur Latin American and Caribbean region, as part of the\r\nworld community, has felt the influence of those events and\r\nhas adjusted the ways in which its internal and external\r\nrelations are organized to the circumstances that prevail in\r\nthis new age.\r\nThese are more than sufficient reasons for our Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean region to welcome and support\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.15, entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Caribbean Community”. The\r\nLatin American and Caribbean region understands that\r\ninstructions from the General Assembly such as those in\r\nresolution A/51/16 of 11 November 1996 contribute to\r\ngreater exchanges of information, cooperation and technical\r\nassistance between the international community of nations\r\nand the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nOne of the shared priorities of the Caribbean region is\r\nthat of striving to consolidate national measures to face and\r\ndevelop a new future defined by a process of economic\r\ngrowth on a sustainable basis that guarantees an\r\nimprovement in the quality of life and the preservation of\r\nnatural resources, especially those of the Caribbean Sea,\r\nmare nostrum.\r\nThe United Nations Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/53/275) of 18 August 1998, gives us an account of the\r\nsignificant Cooperation Agreement signed between the\r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and of\r\nCARICOM, on the occasion of the First General Meeting\r\nbetween Representatives of CARICOM and of the United\r\nNations system, which took place here at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters on 27 and 28 May 1997. This kind of\r\nagreement makes it clear that there can be new spheres of\r\ncooperation, which we believe should be explored and\r\ndeveloped more systematically and extensively.\r\nThanks to the signing of these agreements, it has\r\nbeen possible to develop an exchange of cooperation and\r\ntechnical assistance between the United Nations and the\r\ncountries of CARICOM, despite the existing limitations\r\nin terms of financial and human resources.\r\nIn this regard, allow me to highlight some of these\r\ncooperation exchange programmes. First of all,\r\ncooperation between the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) and CARICOM stresses the\r\neradication of poverty by assisting the Governments of\r\nthe Caribbean region in their endeavours to implement\r\nnational plans, strategies and policies in the area of\r\npoverty eradication. Furthermore, bearing in mind that the\r\nregion is prone to natural disasters, UNDP, in\r\ncollaboration with the Organization of American States\r\nand other organizations, continues to support the\r\nCaribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency. In\r\naddition, UNDP has commissioned studies on the subject\r\nof good governance and development, intended to\r\nstimulate debate and foster dialogue on the broad range of\r\nquestions relating to good governance from a Caribbean\r\nperspective.\r\nThere was also a formal arrangement for assistance\r\nand support from the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme to the CARICOM secretariat for the\r\npreparation and convening of the Caribbean Sea Forum,\r\nheld in Trinidad and Tobago from 2 to 6 June 1998 as\r\npart of the celebration of the Year of the Ocean.\r\nThere has been stepped-up cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme\r\nand CARICOM, with a view to securing regional\r\ncoordination in the area of drug control. CARICOM’s\r\nactive participation in the Second Regional Meeting on\r\nDrug Control Coordination and Cooperation in the\r\nCaribbean, held in Santo Domingo on 8 and 9 December\r\n1997, is an example of the exchange of joint regional\r\ncooperation to which I referred earlier.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nLastly, we wish to mention the cooperation of the\r\nInternational Research and Training Institute for the\r\nAdvancement of Women in the form of studies presented\r\nas papers during the twenty-second meeting of the Standing\r\nCommittee of Caribbean Statisticians, held in Saint Lucia\r\nfrom 4 to 7 November 1997, on measuring unwaged work\r\nfor possible inclusion in Caribbean national accounts.\r\nAs we have seen, the relations of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and CARICOM have been changing,\r\npolitical and economically. The Caribbean region is mindful\r\nof the need to make use of the innovative capacity of its\r\ninternal structures to bring about changes that will take the\r\nCaribbean region along a new path of economic progress\r\nand prosperity, thus enabling it to guarantee reliable\r\ndemocracy for its countries.\r\nBut the Caribbean cannot do this alone. That is why,\r\nin my capacity as Chairperson of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, I take this opportunity to\r\ninvite Member States to adopt by consensus draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.15, entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Caribbean Community”.\r\nMiss Durant (Jamaica): My delegation wishes first of\r\nall to associate itself with the statement delivered earlier by\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Guyana, on behalf of the\r\nmember States of the Caribbean Community, on agenda\r\nitem 23, “Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nJamaica is particularly pleased that, since this item\r\nwas last considered by the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfirst session, the relationship between CARICOM and the\r\nUnited Nations — a relationship on which CARICOM\r\nStates place great store — has been further formalized.\r\nWe welcome the signing of the cooperation agreement\r\nbetween the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and\r\nthe Caribbean Community in May 1997 and hope that it\r\nwill result in more structured collaboration between the two\r\norganizations. We share the view of the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General that this important event has ushered in\r\na new era of partnership, one which we expect will be more\r\nproductive and more meaningful.\r\nJamaica therefore welcomes the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, contained in document A/53/275 and\r\nAddendum 1, which gives a comprehensive account of the\r\nmany activities undertaken over the past two years and also\r\npoints to areas in which continued collaboration would be\r\nmost fruitful. We note with satisfaction the wide range of\r\nUnited Nations bodies engaged in cooperative activity\r\nwith CARICOM and fully endorse the programmes of\r\nwork being pursued.\r\nI wish to highlight some of the programmes\r\nmentioned in the report, to which Jamaica attaches\r\nparticular importance.\r\nCARICOM-United Nations collaboration on the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States (SIDS) has been particularly useful.\r\nApart from the technical assistance provided to member\r\nStates at the national level, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme has undertaken a range of\r\nprojects at the subregional level, working alongside\r\nCaribbean institutions like the University of the West\r\nIndies Centre for Environment and Development and the\r\nCaribbean Conservation Association. The directory of\r\nexperts on small island developing States and the small\r\nisland developing States information network, established\r\nwithin the Regional Caribbean Capacity 21 Programme,\r\nare among the more valuable projects. The establishment\r\nof the Small Island Developing States Network\r\n(SIDSNET) has already enhanced communications among\r\nisland communities worldwide about issues relating to\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe Port of Spain Office of the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean\r\n(ECLAC) also continues to make a significant\r\ncontribution by sharing with CARICOM the\r\nresponsibilities of the interim secretariat for the\r\nimplementation of the small island developing States\r\nProgramme of Action in our subregion. Worthy of special\r\nrecognition is the technical support which ECLAC gave\r\nto the Caribbean Ministerial Meeting on the Programme\r\nof Action for the SIDS follow-up, held in Barbados in\r\nNovember 1997. Jamaica, with the rest of CARICOM,\r\nlooks forward to continued support for the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action as well as for the follow-up of\r\nother global conferences.\r\nI also wish to mention the importance my delegation\r\nattaches to collaboration with the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme, in particular its Regional Seas\r\nProgramme, and with the United Nations Centre for\r\nHuman Settlements (HABITAT), as well as with other\r\norganizations in the area of disaster preparedness and\r\nnatural disaster reduction.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nCooperation between the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme (UNDCP) and CARICOM on\r\nregional drug-control initiatives is another area of\r\nmeaningful cooperation. UNDCP was an important actor in\r\nthe preparation of the Barbados Plan of Action for drug\r\ncontrol coordination and cooperation in the Caribbean. The\r\nCaribbean Drug Control Coordination Mechanism has\r\npursued a very active programme with CARICOM\r\ninstitutions and member Governments and Jamaica wishes\r\nto express its sincere appreciation for the substantial\r\nsupport for national and regional anti-narcotic initiatives\r\nwhich we continue to receive through such cooperation.\r\nAnother important area of CARICOM-United Nations\r\ncooperation is the assistance provided for the establishment\r\nof the CARICOM single market and economy. In addition\r\nto the design of the legal framework and facilitation of the\r\nconsultative process, technical assistance for the\r\nstrengthening of the technical negotiating capacity of the\r\nmember States has been very useful. Jamaica looks forward\r\nto continued support in this area as the countries of the\r\nCaribbean pursue deeper subregional integration and\r\nprepare to participate in wider regional integration\r\nprocesses.\r\nLooking to the future, an important area on which\r\nCARICOM has placed great emphasis for the achievement\r\nof sustainable development is that of capacity-building. We\r\ntherefore hope that the United Nations project on assistance\r\nto public administration systems at the central and local\r\ngovernmental levels will result in greater efficiency and\r\neffectiveness in the public sectors throughout the Caribbean.\r\nThe heads of Government of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, at their 18th Conference held in Montego Bay\r\nin 1997, resolved to ensure through our education systems\r\nthe nurturing of the development of each person’s potential\r\nwithout regard to gender; the development of a culture of\r\nentrepreneurship; research and development as a way of life\r\nand as a means of improving production; and improvement\r\nof the competitiveness of those industries on which our\r\neconomies are based. This commitment is central to our\r\nstrategy for the development of creative and productive\r\ncitizens of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe recall that Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\r\naddressing the University of the West Indies in Kingston,\r\nJamaica, in April 1998, stressed that\r\n“education not only enriches a culture; it is the first\r\ncondition for freedom, democracy, and sustainable\r\ndevelopment”.\r\nWe in the Caribbean look to the United Nations to\r\nsupport our aspirations in this regard.\r\nJamaica expresses its satisfaction with the progress\r\nof cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community. We have therefore joined in\r\ncosponsoring draft resolution A/53/L.15 and commend it\r\nto this Assembly for adoption by consensus.\r\nMr. Cho (Republic of Korea): My delegation would\r\nlike to extend its appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive report on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM), as contained in document A/53/275 and\r\nAddendum 1.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that, over the last two\r\nyears, a wide range of activities has been undertaken to\r\nstrengthen cooperation between CARICOM and various\r\narms of the United Nations system, including the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\r\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP),\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and the Economic Commission\r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).\r\nMoreover, we appreciate that the Department of Political\r\nAffairs of the United Nations Secretariat, the focal point\r\nfor cooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations, is maintaining a list of United Nations focal\r\npoints, facilitating a more pragmatic and cost-effective\r\ncooperation with CARICOM.\r\nDuring the two years under review, one of the most\r\nremarkable developments was the signing of a\r\ncooperation agreement between the two organizations\r\nduring the First General Meeting between Representatives\r\nof CARICOM and its Associated Institutions and of the\r\nUnited Nations system, held in May 1997. We welcome\r\nthis development, as it lays a solid foundation for further\r\nenhancing the cooperation already existing between the\r\ntwo organizations, and it signals a diversification in\r\ncooperation in various fields, such as peace and security,\r\nsustainable development and human rights.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation hopes that the\r\nSecond General Meeting between CARICOM and the\r\nUnited Nations system will be held in 1999 in the\r\nCaribbean region in order to assess progress in the\r\nimplementation of the agreed areas and to discuss\r\nadditional measures to intensify cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nAs we learn lessons from our history, peace and\r\nstability turn out to be essential elements for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Therefore, my delegation welcomes the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General for greater interaction and\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations, including CARICOM, in the field of conflict\r\nprevention. We hope that these efforts will continue to be\r\npromoted and expanded through follow-up meetings\r\nbetween the United Nations Secretariat and the secretariats\r\nof the regional organizations in the area of early warning\r\nand conflict prevention.\r\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, the world\r\nfinds itself moving towards becoming a single global\r\nvillage. Although the geographical distance is great between\r\nthe Republic of Korea and the Caribbean region,\r\ncooperative relations have been forged and expanded\r\nbetween the two. We have paid significant attention to the\r\ninterests of small island countries, and the Caribbean\r\ncountries in particular, in their strenuous endeavours for\r\neconomic, social and political development.\r\nIt is in this context that the Republic of Korea has\r\nbeen making consistent efforts to strengthen its bilateral ties\r\nwith the countries in the Caribbean region through the\r\npromotion of trade, investment and greater exchanges,\r\nincluding technical assistance. We have also actively\r\nparticipated in the international community’s efforts to\r\nstrengthen the democratic process and the protection of\r\nhuman rights in the region, particularly through\r\nparticipation in the UNDP trust fund for a police\r\nprogramme in Haiti. Despite the daunting task of\r\novercoming the current financial crisis, the Republic of\r\nKorea will continue to make active contributions to the\r\nefforts of the CARICOM countries in promoting peace and\r\nprosperity by sharing our own experience in democratic and\r\neconomic development.\r\nThe twenty-first century will see a more\r\ninterdependent world as a result of the rapid development\r\nof technology and globalization. Regional integration and\r\ncooperation will be pervasive, transcending the borders of\r\nStates. In this context, we believe that cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations, such as\r\nCARICOM, should be further strengthened and intensified\r\nin the coming years.\r\nIn line with the objectives of the United Nations, these\r\ntwo bodies can bring their vast experience and expertise to\r\nthe task of fostering peace and security, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and friendly relations among States in the\r\nregion through cooperation and coordination of their\r\nstrengths. For our part, the Republic of Korea, which has\r\na long-standing friendship with many CARICOM\r\ncountries, will continue to support CARICOM’s efforts to\r\nthat end.\r\nIn conclusion, the Republic of Korea, as a sponsor,\r\nstrongly supports draft resolution A/53/L.15, and we hope\r\nthat it will be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 46/8 of 16 October 1991, I call on\r\nthe Observer for the Caribbean Community.\r\nMr. Marville (Caribbean Community): I wish, on\r\nbehalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), to\r\nexpress thanks to the United Nations agencies and to\r\nthose countries which assisted the countries of the region\r\nmost severely struck by the passage of hurricane Georges.\r\nTheir assistance was deeply appreciated and once again\r\nconfirmed to us in the region their degree of friendship\r\nand the place which our small area of Caribbean States\r\nholds in the international community. At the same time,\r\nI wish to express our concern and hope that those\r\ncountries affected by the passage of hurricane Mitch will\r\nenjoy a similar level of support, thus enabling them to\r\nadjust rapidly following that onslaught.\r\nI also wish to state how deeply distressed the\r\nCommunity has been over the seemingly mindless\r\natrocities being carried out in Kosovo. The Community\r\nwill continue to monitor the situation there and support\r\nthe international community in its efforts to bring peace\r\nto that area. The most recent news from Kosovo,\r\nfortunately, offers us a ray of hope.\r\nAt the same time, the Community wishes to express\r\nits confidence that the agreement recently entered into\r\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians will remain a binding\r\ninstrument. In the Caribbean Community we have always\r\nattempted, both as separate States and as a region, to\r\ncontribute to world peace and stability in support of and\r\nin collaboration with the United Nations.\r\nTwo years ago, a similar resolution to that which is\r\nnow being considered was adopted in this forum. The\r\nCaribbean Community welcomed the support given to that\r\nresolution then, as it now looks forward to support for\r\ntoday’s draft resolution.\r\nOur Community States place great reliance on\r\nmultilateral systems and rules. We expect those rules to\r\ntake into consideration the various levels of development\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\nin the sovereign States which comprise the international\r\ncommunity. In no international race does the amateur\r\nseriously compete with the professional; in no international\r\ncompetition does the lightweight compete with the\r\nheavyweight. Differences are recognized and concessions\r\nprovided. When, therefore, representatives of countries\r\nspeak of a level playing field, we ought to be certain that\r\nthe playing field is indeed level.\r\nThe Caribbean Community thus calls on the members\r\nof the international community once again to recognize the\r\ncritical need for the small, vulnerable States of the\r\nCaribbean to be able to continue to benefit unfettered from\r\nthe provisions of the European Union banana regime. Our\r\nEuropean partners have made every effort to be compliant\r\nwith the World Trade Organization, yet new challenges\r\nthreaten. The Caribbean Community calls particularly on its\r\nspecial friends in this international community, whichever\r\ncontinent they are from, to support it on this issue.\r\nAnother issue of concern to the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, one for which it is attracting a fair amount of\r\nsupport from United Nations agencies and States and\r\ngroups of States of the Organization, is the issue of the\r\nillicit trafficking in drugs and small weaponry. The\r\nCaribbean Community remains pleased at the level of\r\ncooperation and support it is receiving in this area, but at\r\nthe same time it calls for greater efforts to be made in\r\nprogrammes for drug demand reduction.\r\nAs a community devoted to having the Caribbean Sea\r\ninternationally recognized as a special area in the context of\r\nsustainable development, the Community also looks forward\r\nto the support of the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity in developing this concept and having it\r\nadopted at a future meeting of the General Assembly.\r\nA number of critical issues facing CARICOM, and\r\ntheir resolution, may in many ways amount to a redefining\r\nof the Community itself and of the way it conducts its\r\naffairs. These include the CARICOM initiative to help\r\nbring about a resolution to the post-December electoral\r\npolitical crisis in Guyana. This process, which is continuing\r\nand which continues to benefit from the resources of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has\r\nmarked a new development by CARICOM as it continues\r\nto support democracy in the hemisphere and to promote\r\nconflict prevention. Similar assistance was also provided by\r\nUNDP to Saint Kitts and Nevis as the nationals of that\r\ncountry pondered issues related to the secession of Nevis\r\nfrom the federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nThese issues, the menace of drug trafficking and\r\nother examples of problems of this sort in the region,\r\nsuggest that the region cannot, and must not, be\r\ncomplacent on the issue of democracy, but must actively\r\nseek to strengthen the democratic procedures which for\r\nmany years have made us proud. The Charter of Civil\r\nSociety of the Caribbean Community, which has been\r\nadopted Community-wide, provides the normative\r\nmoorings for the Governments and governed of the\r\nCommunity. The Assembly of Caribbean Community\r\nParliamentarians needs to be strengthened to allow for\r\nmuch more cross-territory discourse on issues affecting\r\nour region, including the democratic process.\r\nIn July 1997, heads of Government of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity agreed to accept the application by the\r\nRepublic of Haiti for membership in the Caribbean\r\nCommunity. While remaining concerned over the political\r\nimpasse which continues to exist in that country over the\r\nelection of a Prime Minister, the Community continues to\r\nmeet with Haiti, at a technical level, to work out the\r\nterms and conditions of Haiti’s membership. The\r\nexpanded Community will continue to require the\r\nassistance of the United Nations and the Member States\r\nin pursuing its developmental activities.\r\nImportant among these is the establishment of a\r\nCaribbean single market and economy. Work is\r\ncontinuing apace to ensure that the single market becomes\r\na reality on 1 January 1999. Four of the nine protocols to\r\nallow for this substantial transformation of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity have been signed and have provisionally\r\nentered into force. Once again we wish particularly to\r\nthank UNDP for the level of assistance rendered in this\r\ncritical process. It is internally intended to achieve\r\neconomies of scale by creating a single economic space,\r\nrather than having several small economies. The single\r\nmarket will not promote a closed market but instead a\r\nmarket well suited to investment and trade.\r\nIn order to benefit from the opportunities which will\r\nbe derived from this, the Community will be looking to\r\nthe United Nations and countries of the international\r\ncommunity to promote the development of its human\r\nresources, particularly in fields which will allow it to be\r\nmore competitive in the new world economic\r\nenvironment.\r\nIn this context, the Community looks forward to its\r\nparticipation in the 1999 small island developing States\r\nreview conference. We have already advanced our\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 49th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 29 October 1998\r\npreparatory process, and we eagerly await the discussions\r\nwhich will take place at that meeting.\r\nOur Community faces many challenges at this time.\r\nThrough experience we know that we can count on the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies for support in\r\nmeeting and benefiting from these challenges.\r\nIn supporting the draft resolution, the Caribbean\r\nCommunity pledges to continue in its support, particularly\r\nin the regional context, for the aims and objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now take\r\na decision on draft resolution A/53/L.15.\r\nI should like to announce that since the introduction\r\nof the draft resolution, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia has become a sponsor.\r\nI call on the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Mustafa (Chief, General Assembly Servicing\r\nBranch): I should like to inform the General Assembly\r\nthat should the Assembly adopt draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.15, there will be no programme budget\r\nimplications.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the\r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/53/L.15?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.15 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/17).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 23?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n28\r\n"
