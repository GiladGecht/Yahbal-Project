(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 14 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of the Agency (A/53/286)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.18)\r\nAmendment (A/53/L.19)\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): On behalf of my delegation, I\r\nwould like to express our sincere thanks to the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\nfor his comprehensive report. This annual report enables us\r\nto review the work of the Agency, which is undergoing a\r\ndynamic transformation under its Director General, Mr.\r\nMohamed ElBaradei. Allow me also to take this\r\nopportunity to assure him of our full support in the\r\ndischarge of his mandate.\r\nFor more than 40 years, the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, as a special United Nations institution, has\r\nprovided valuable assistance to Member States in the\r\napplication of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. There\r\nis no denying that the IAEA’s prominent role in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation in the use of atomic energy for\r\npeaceful purposes is today more relevant than ever to the\r\ninterests of Member States.\r\nThe Agency’s activities in the area of technical\r\ncooperation continue to play an important role in\r\nachieving sustainable development in developing\r\ncountries. As we are all aware, supplying adequate and\r\naffordable energy services is an essential element of\r\nsustainable development. Here the challenge is to develop\r\nthose energy services that best support development and\r\nthe quality of life, especially in developing countries.\r\nIn this connection, it is noteworthy that Agenda 21,\r\nadopted by the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, emphasized the\r\nintegration of environmental and developmental concerns\r\ninto the decision-making process. Furthermore,\r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, held in\r\nDecember 1997 in Kyoto, refocused attention on energy\r\nand the environment and also provided the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency with an opportunity to present\r\ninformation about its work on the costs and benefits of\r\nnuclear energy and other energy alternatives. Indeed, that\r\nwas one of the many examples of the Agency’s\r\ncontributing to the United Nations system-wide objective\r\nof sustainable development.\r\nMy delegation would also like to comment on the\r\nwork of the Agency regarding the safety of radiation\r\nsources. It cannot be overemphasized that the safety of\r\nradiation sources and the security of radioactive material\r\ncontinue to be matters of special concern. There is a\r\ngrowing realization that the world population is exposed\r\nto radiation from a number of sources, including natural,\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nartificial and occupational sources. The Agency’s ongoing\r\nsupport, as a matter of priority, for the model project on the\r\nupgrading of radiation and waste safety infrastructures in\r\nsome developing countries, with the focus on the control of\r\nradiation sources, is highly commendable. We are\r\nconvinced that the Agency’s involvement in that respect\r\nwill bring about a working system of notification,\r\nauthorization and control, and an inventory of all radiation\r\nsources in the participating developing countries.\r\nLet me now briefly touch upon the Agency’s nuclear\r\nsafeguards and verification system, as stipulated in the\r\nStatute. Since the decision on the indefinite extension of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\r\nat the 1995 Review and Extension Conference, the\r\nsafeguards system and the verification of nuclear non-\r\nproliferation have become all the more important. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that all IAEA safeguards and\r\nverification measures be applied in a non-discriminatory\r\nmanner and in conformity with the relevant provisions of\r\nthe NPT.\r\nNutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, vitamins\r\nand minerals continue to affect hundreds of millions of\r\npeople, particularly in the developing world. In this regard,\r\nwe are pleased to note that the IAEA’s programmes\r\ndirecting attention to the use of isotopic techniques to\r\nidentify populations at risk and to monitor and improve the\r\neffectiveness of dietary intervention programmes are\r\nbenefiting the developing countries. My delegation is also\r\nappreciative of the IAEA’s role in assisting its 128 member\r\nStates, almost 80 per cent of which do not have nuclear\r\npower programmes, in the use of radionuclides, primarily\r\nfor research, medical, industrial and agricultural\r\napplications.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to commend the fruitful\r\ncooperation between the IAEA and other United Nations\r\nbodies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n(FAO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), and other international\r\norganizations. It is essential that this cooperation be further\r\nstrengthened.\r\nIn conclusion, I would again like to thank Director\r\nGeneral Mohamed ElBaradei for his report and for his able\r\nguidance of the work of the Agency. We are confident that,\r\nunder his leadership, the Agency will be able to meet the\r\nchallenges ahead.\r\nMs. Rozgoňová (Slovakia): Slovakia associated\r\nitself with the statement presented by the representative of\r\nAustria on behalf of the European Union. Nevertheless,\r\nsince Slovakia was recently elected a member of the\r\nBoard of Governors, I would also like to make a\r\nstatement on the national level.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to express our appreciation\r\nfor the excellent work of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), led by Director General Mohamed\r\nElBaradei during the past year.\r\nThe Slovak Republic considers the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency to be the key organization which\r\nfulfils, through its safeguards system, irreplaceable\r\nfunctions in the observance of the provisions of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) and in the promotion of international cooperation\r\nin the peaceful use of atomic energy. Slovakia also\r\nappreciates the role of the Agency in ensuring that the\r\nassistance it provides in various forms to member States\r\nis not misused for military purposes.\r\nThe Agency’s success over the 41 years of its\r\nexistence is the result of the common efforts of the\r\nmember States and the secretariat in the field of the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy, as well as in technical\r\ncooperation. Slovakia, as a country with an active nuclear\r\nprogramme, ascribes great importance to cooperation with\r\nthe IAEA in the development of the Slovak nuclear\r\nprogramme and the improvement of its nuclear safety.\r\nI would like to mention the key positions of\r\nSlovakia on the nuclear agenda. Slovakia welcomed the\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons at the Review and Extension\r\nConference in 1995, which supported the activities of the\r\nAgency in the area of technical cooperation and the\r\napplication of the safeguards system. We believe that the\r\nReview Conference in 2000 will result in a positive\r\nevaluation of the Treaty implementation and that it will\r\napprove the new measures aimed at strengthening the\r\neffectiveness and the further improvement of the\r\nefficiency of the safeguards system. Slovakia sees the\r\nuniversality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) as very important elements of the\r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and\r\nnuclear disarmament are also strengthened by the growing\r\nnumber of signatories to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nBan Treaty, which has reached 150, and by its 21\r\nratifications. Slovakia ratified the CTBT in March 1998 as\r\none of the 44 countries the ratifications of which are\r\nnecessary for the entry into force of the Treaty. Slovakia\r\nsupports the process of enhancing cooperation between the\r\nAgency and the Preparatory Commission for the CTBT\r\nOrganization for political, technical and financial reasons.\r\nThe issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\r\nand nuclear disarmament was brought to the centre of the\r\ninternational community’s attention after the nuclear tests\r\nin India and Pakistan. Slovakia expressed its concern about\r\nthese tests and we hope that, after the recent statements of\r\nthe Prime Ministers of both countries, India and Pakistan\r\nwill sign and ratify the CTBT without condition and\r\nwithout delay.\r\nAnother contribution to the Review Conference of the\r\nNPT in 2000, in our view, is the decision of the Conference\r\non Disarmament to start negotiations on the preparation of\r\na treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for\r\nnuclear weapons and other explosive devices. We support\r\nthe initiative of the Director General of the IAEA to offer\r\nthe assistance of the Agency to the Conference on\r\nDisarmament in developing the technical arrangements for\r\nthis treaty.\r\nWe are in favour of the verification activities of the\r\nIAEA with respect to the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea. We welcome the initiative of the Director General\r\nto provide the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea with\r\nthe Model Additional Protocol and we hope that it will\r\ncooperate fully with the IAEA in the implementation of its\r\nsafeguards obligations and negotiate the adoption of an\r\nAdditional Protocol.\r\nSlovakia regrets the decision of Iraq to suspend its\r\ncooperation with the Security Council and the IAEA and\r\nurges Iraq to observe the relevant resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council and the Memorandum of Understanding\r\nwith the United Nations Secretary-General of February\r\n1998.\r\nI would like to turn now to some organizational\r\nmatters which have been initiated by the Director General.\r\nSlovakia follows with great attention the\r\nimplementation of the Action Plan, which resulted from the\r\nsenior management conference in January of this year. In\r\nview of the financial difficulties the Agency has been\r\nexperiencing over the last decade, we welcome the\r\ninitiatives to put a greater emphasis on the programme and\r\nbudget formulation process by creating a new programme\r\ncoordination committee. The process of optimizing\r\nresource allocation while maintaining the main functions\r\nof the Agency should be carefully evaluated and further\r\ndeveloped. The main aim of this process should result in\r\nimproved cost-effectiveness, to the benefit of member\r\nStates.\r\nIn connection with the Action Plan, my country is\r\nlooking forward to the preparation of the medium-term\r\nstrategy, a document which will chart the direction of the\r\nAgency over the next five years. We expect that this\r\ndocument will in a very concrete form set out the overall\r\nobjectives and goals for optimizing resource allocation\r\nand maintaining the main functions of the Agency.\r\nIn the area of strengthened safeguards systems,\r\nSlovakia sees in the conclusion of additional protocols to\r\nsafeguards agreements a significant contribution to the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy and the global non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, to which Slovakia is\r\nready to contribute.\r\nAfter Slovakia’s active participation in Committee\r\n24, and the subsequent consultations with the Agency, the\r\nBoard of Governors approved in September the text of the\r\nnew agreement between the Slovak Republic and the\r\nIAEA for the applications of safeguards in connection\r\nwith the NPT and the protocol additional to this\r\nagreement. The safeguards agreement will replace the\r\npresent agreement, which was concluded with the\r\nGovernment of the former Czechoslovakia.\r\nCooperation between the Agency and member States\r\nin the area of nuclear safety and radiation protection is\r\none of the most important issues for Slovakia. Nuclear\r\nenergy plays an important role in the Slovak economy,\r\nwith nuclear power plants producing nearly 50 per cent of\r\nSlovakia’s electricity.\r\nThis year Slovakia celebrates the twentieth\r\nanniversary of the commissioning of the first unit of a\r\nnuclear power plant with a water-cooled and water-\r\nmoderated reactor (WWER) at Jaslovske Bohunice.\r\nThe commissioning of the first unit of the second\r\nnuclear power plant in Slovakia, the Mochovce nuclear\r\npower plant, took place on 9 June 1998. The\r\ncommissioning of the Mochovce nuclear power plant unit\r\n2 is planned for 1999. The commissioning of this power\r\nplant was preceded by technically and financially\r\ndemanding completion work and safety upgrading\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nprogrammes. The Mochovce nuclear power plant is an\r\nexample of international cooperation in achieving\r\ninternationally acceptable safety standards. Companies from\r\nFrance, Germany, the United States, the Russian Federation,\r\nthe Czech Republic and Slovakia, together with the Agency,\r\nparticipated significantly in the upgrading of the safety level\r\nof this nuclear power plant. The competent Slovak\r\nauthorities consider the Agency’s assistance in particular to\r\nbe an essential component of international transparency in\r\nall safety-related matters.\r\nSlovakia ratified the Convention on Nuclear Safety on\r\n7 March 1995, as the first country with land-based nuclear\r\nreactors in operation.\r\nIn the area of radiation protection, Slovakia has\r\ncontributed significantly to the strengthening of\r\ninternational cooperation by taking steps necessary for the\r\nratification of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent\r\nFuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste\r\nManagement. Following the adoption of resolution\r\nGC(41)/RES/11 at the forty-first IAEA General Conference,\r\nthe National Council of the Slovak Republic has expressed\r\nits approval of the Joint Convention and we expect to\r\ndeposit the instruments of ratification with the Director\r\nGeneral of the IAEA by the end of 1998.\r\nWith respect to resolution GC(41)/RES/21, the Slovak\r\nGovernment decided in July this year to participate in and\r\nsupport the international initiative for the Chernobyl\r\nsarcophagus. Slovakia will contribute to the Shelter\r\nImplementation Plan the amount of 2 million ECU, and this\r\ncontribution will be pledged despite the budgetary\r\ndifficulties and the natural disasters which have occurred in\r\nSlovakia this year.\r\nMr. Squadron (United States of America): On behalf\r\nof the United States, I would like to commend the Director\r\nGeneral for his report. We note with appreciation his\r\noutstanding performance this past year as the new Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\nin support of the IAEA’s important contributions to\r\ninternational peace and prosperity.\r\nOver the years, the IAEA has been committed to a\r\ndiverse set of programmes that enhance the security, the\r\nhealth, the environment and the safety of the international\r\ncommunity. It has done so with distinction. The IAEA’s\r\nachievements reflected in the Director General’s report\r\ndemonstrate the critical role of the Agency in encouraging\r\ncooperation in the many important peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nmaterial and technology under sound non-proliferation\r\nconditions.\r\nThe Agency’s safeguards system performs the\r\nessential function of verifying compliance with the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\r\nother non-proliferation treaties. The United States\r\nreaffirms the importance of the Model Additional Protocol\r\napproved on 15 May 1997, and is proud to have been the\r\nfirst nuclear-weapon State to sign the additional protocol.\r\nThe United States strongly supports continued efforts to\r\nbring the agreed new safeguards measures into effect as\r\nquickly and as widely as possible.\r\nStrengthening nuclear safety continues to be a\r\ncentral goal of the IAEA. The Department of Nuclear\r\nSafety works effectively with other elements of the\r\nAgency and the member States to ensure that safety\r\nremains a priority in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nThe Agency’s extensive training programmes promote\r\nsafety. Operational safety review teams and other safety\r\nservices provided by the IAEA to its member States offer\r\ntop quality advice and help to focus the Agency’s safety\r\nassistance and technical cooperation programmes where\r\nthey are most needed. The Convention on Nuclear Safety,\r\nfor which the IAEA serves as Secretariat, embodies the\r\ncommitment of its signatories to safety. The United States\r\nreaffirms its strong support for the IAEA’s work in\r\nnuclear safety throughout the world and our commitment\r\nto strengthen further these important activities.\r\nThe United States would also like to commend the\r\nAgency’s continued efforts to implement the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions in regard to Iraq. The United States\r\nstrongly urges Iraq to rescind its 5 August decision to\r\nsuspend cooperation with the United Nations Special\r\nCommission (UNSCOM) and the IAEA. As stated in the\r\n14 May Security Council presidential statement, Iraq must\r\nanswer all of the IAEA’s remaining questions and\r\nconcerns before the Council will endorse a transition to\r\nlong-term monitoring. In particular, as required under\r\nSecurity Council resolution 715 (1991), Iraq should pass\r\npenal legislation prohibiting activity contrary to Security\r\nCouncil resolution 687 (1991).\r\nThe United States is concerned about the lack of\r\ncooperation of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea with the IAEA. We encourage that country to work\r\nwith the Agency to take all steps deemed necessary by\r\nthe IAEA to monitor the Agreed Framework. We also\r\nencourage the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to\r\ntake steps now — such as steps to preserve\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\ninformation — which will help facilitate the IAEA’s task of\r\nverifying that country’s initial declarations at the\r\nappropriate time under the Agreed Framework. We call on\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to abide by the\r\nterms of the Agreed Framework and to take no action\r\nwhich could be perceived as undermining its commitment\r\nto the Framework.\r\nThe United States commends the IAEA’s programme\r\nfor combating illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. Sixty\r\ncountries presently participate in the Agency’s illicit\r\ntrafficking database, which demonstrates a strong interest in\r\ncooperative efforts in monitoring nuclear materials and\r\nother radioactive sources. We are grateful to the IAEA for\r\nits leadership in providing systematic and methodical\r\nanalyses in this critical area. Additionally, since good\r\nphysical protection is the best means to prevent illicit\r\ntrafficking in nuclear material, we commend the Agency’s\r\nefforts in working to improve physical protection guidelines\r\nand assisting States in implementing effective physical\r\nprotection systems.\r\nThe United States wishes to reiterate its continued\r\nsupport for the IAEA’s technical cooperation programme.\r\nAs the major contributor to this valuable programme, we\r\nrecognize its importance in promoting the quality of human\r\nlife in many countries. The diverse projects undertaken by\r\nthe technical cooperation programme and their many\r\nbenefits provide the world with a better understanding of\r\nhow nuclear materials can be used to help solve problems\r\nin medicine, health, agriculture and basic industry. This\r\nwork helps to fulfil the vision of expanding the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear material for the future.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of the United States, I\r\nwould again like to thank Mr. ElBaradei for his report and\r\nnote the superb beginning of his tenure. We look forward\r\nto our continued cooperation with the IAEA, recognizing\r\nfully the importance of this valuable asset to the security of\r\nthe world and its people.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of Iran): The\r\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran notes with\r\nsatisfaction the annual report of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) to the General Assembly for the\r\nyear 1997, which summarizes the Agency’s significant\r\nachievements during that period. We thank Mr. ElBaradei,\r\nthe Director General of the IAEA, for his thorough and\r\ninformative statement featuring the main developments in\r\nthe activities of the Agency during 1997.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran attaches great\r\nimportance to international cooperation in the peaceful\r\napplication of nuclear energy, and has pursued with great\r\ninterest the promotional role of the Agency in this field.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the useful technical cooperation\r\nthe Agency extends to Member States in the field of\r\nagriculture, industry, medicine and other related areas,\r\nsuch as water desalination. In this regard, the importance\r\nof sustained funding, particularly through voluntary\r\ncontributions, for the Agency’s technical assistance\r\nprograms needs to be highlighted. The fact that the\r\nAgency’s Technical Cooperation Fund is not based on\r\npredictable and assured resources is a matter of concern\r\nfor all developing countries.\r\nExceptional cases of violation of IAEA safeguards\r\nin the recent past, however, have provided an excuse for\r\ncertain nuclear-weapon States and some other\r\nindustrialized countries to undermine the statutory tasks\r\nand obligations of the Agency towards the developing\r\ncountries and to infringe more than before upon the rights\r\nof the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) with regard to the peaceful uses\r\nof nuclear energy. Such policies are pursued for political\r\ngain and are against the interests and needs of even those\r\ndeveloping countries that are certified by IAEA\r\ninspections for their peaceful nuclear energy programmes\r\nand that have pursued an open-door policy regarding the\r\nIAEA inspections.\r\nParties to the NPT, as the Treaty stipulates, have the\r\nright to develop, research, produce and use nuclear energy\r\nfor peaceful purposes. This right should be ensured by\r\nmember States, and not violated. Not only should access\r\nto nuclear energy be unimpeded, but preferential\r\ntreatment should be provided, in conformity with the\r\nTreaty. This, of course, does not prevent any State from\r\nraising concerns about possible mischief by any other\r\nState. But this should not be arbitrary and unilateral. The\r\nIAEA is the competent authority to address such\r\nconcerns. The parties to the NPT, in fact, reaffirmed their\r\nacceptance of this authority and agreed that their concerns\r\nshould be submitted to the IAEA with supporting\r\nevidence. They further agreed that the IAEA should\r\nexamine these concerns and make its conclusions on the\r\nissue. Therefore, the States that decide not to cooperate\r\nwith any member of the NPT whose compliance with the\r\nprovisions of the Treaty has been verified by the IAEA\r\nfail in their solemn undertaking to facilitate the fullest\r\nexchange of equipment, material and scientific and\r\ntechnological information for peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy, to which the Treaty binds them. It was also\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nstressed at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference\r\nthat such facilities must be provided to all States parties,\r\nwithout discrimination.\r\nRegarding implementation of the protocol additional\r\nto safeguards agreements, my Government firmly believes\r\nthat this protocol should be applied equally and in a non-\r\ndiscriminatory manner to nuclear facilities and activities of\r\nall States members of the Agency, and in particular nuclear-\r\nweapon States. The universality of the new safeguards\r\nsystem is an effective way to ensure the compliance of all\r\nStates that have assumed obligations under the NPT and the\r\nStatute of the IAEA.\r\nWe commend the efforts of the Agency in enhancing\r\nnuclear safety and radiation protection. We firmly believe\r\nthat the scope of such measures should be expanded to all\r\nregions that operate nuclear installations, as the risks to life,\r\nhealth, environment and security emanating from such\r\ninstallations are not confined by national boundaries.\r\nIn this context, the continued operation of the\r\nunsafeguarded and entirely non-peaceful nuclear facilities\r\nin Israel is a source of great concern to the Middle Eastern\r\ncountries. The refusal of Israel, the sole non-party in the\r\nMiddle East to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, to place its nuclear facilities under the\r\ncomprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, has defeated all efforts aimed at the\r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle\r\nEast. My delegation welcomes the final communiqué of the\r\ntwenty-fifth session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign\r\nMinisters in March 1998, which inter alia, called upon the\r\nSecurity Council to obtain Israel’s renunciation of nuclear\r\narmament, and to submit a full report on its stockpile of\r\nnuclear weapons and ammunition to the Security Council\r\nand the International Atomic Energy Agency. We also\r\ncommend the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)\r\nrecommendation in this respect, as well as the recent\r\ndecision of the General Conference of the IAEA at its\r\nforty-second session to restore an item to its agenda at its\r\nforty-third session on Israel’s nuclear capabilities and threat.\r\nWe call upon the international community, and in particular\r\nthe IAEA, to address this issue urgently and effectively.\r\nAs to the issue of the revision of article VI of the\r\nStatute of the Agency on the composition of the Board of\r\nGovernors, we did not see any positive development in the\r\nyear under review. The issue is simple: Africa and the\r\nMiddle East and South Asian group of countries have been\r\nunder-represented in the Board of Governors for decades,\r\nand their legitimate proposal to amend article VI of the\r\nStatute aimed at making the composition of the Board\r\nproportionate to an increased membership of the Agency\r\nhas not resulted in concrete action. The issue has been\r\ncomplicated in recent years by an unacceptable procedure\r\nthat has allowed the genuine and long-standing proposal\r\nof countries located in Africa, the Middle East and South\r\nAsia to become hostage to a package approach calling for\r\na review of the composition of the Middle East and South\r\nAsian region. We are convinced that the composition of\r\nany geographical grouping of the Agency can be decided\r\nonly by members of that grouping and should not be\r\ndictated from outside.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me once again to extend our\r\nappreciation and support to the IAEA for its efforts in\r\npromoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses\r\nof nuclear energy and the non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons in all its aspects. We hope that the IAEA, under\r\nthe new leadership, will continue to promote its lofty\r\nobjectives into the next century.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): I would like to congratulate\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on his\r\nexcellent leadership and the effective manner in which he\r\nis organizing the work of the Agency. I would like to\r\nthank Mr. ElBaradei for his comprehensive statement,\r\nmade earlier today. The long experience that he has had\r\nwith the Agency will, I am sure, help in achieving the\r\nstatutory goals and objectives of the IAEA.\r\nPakistan is a founding member of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency. We remain firmly committed to\r\nits statutory goals and objectives. Pakistan takes justifiable\r\npride in its close cooperation and partnership with the\r\nAgency over the past 40 years. We have benefited greatly\r\nfrom cooperation with the Agency in areas ranging from\r\nnuclear medicine to nuclear safety. Pakistan’s impeccable\r\nrecord in terms of nuclear safety and safeguards, its\r\nparticipation in the Agency’s promotional activities and\r\nits active role in the IAEA’s policy-making organs reflect\r\nour abiding commitment to the promotion of peaceful\r\nuses of atomic energy.\r\nSince energy is a vital input to the development\r\nprocess, energy consumption per capita is bound to\r\nincrease sharply in developing countries. This increase in\r\nenergy demand cannot be met by fossil fuels alone, since\r\nthat would impose an unacceptable burden on the\r\nenvironment. The massive development of hydropower is\r\none option. The only other proven and sustainable option\r\nis nuclear energy. Despite Chernobyl, the safety record of\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nthe nuclear industry is unmatched by any other major\r\nenterprise. Opposition to nuclear power is thus based on\r\nmisunderstanding or is a deliberate pretext to deny this\r\ntechnology to less-favoured nations.\r\nUnfortunately, the growth of nuclear power in both\r\nindustrialized and developing countries, has slowed during\r\nthe last two decades, partly for economic reasons, but\r\nlargely due to ill-informed decisions. There are,\r\nnevertheless, some positive signs. For example, there is\r\nrenewed debate in some European countries regarding their\r\nprevious decisions to abandon nuclear power. A number of\r\nAsian countries are committed to, or keenly interested in,\r\nnuclear power. The Agency must play an active role in\r\nstrengthening the technical infrastructure of member States\r\nthat are interested in the promotion of nuclear power. We\r\nfeel that to address the financial requirements of such a\r\nsupportive role by the Agency, the creation of a nuclear\r\npower fund deserves consideration.\r\nPakistan, which is deficient in fossil fuels, can greatly\r\nbenefit from nuclear energy production. Although our initial\r\nambitious IAEA-sponsored programme was made\r\nimpossible by the post-1974 termination of peaceful and\r\nsafeguarded nuclear cooperation by certain countries,\r\nPakistan maintained and significantly enlarged its\r\ncapabilities in the various elements of the nuclear fuel\r\ncycle. At present, we operate two research reactors and one\r\npower reactor, safely and effectively. We are grateful for\r\nthe Agency’s cooperation and assistance for safety upgrades\r\nof the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) power\r\nreactor. The construction of the Chashma nuclear power\r\nplant, provided under IAEA safeguards by China, is\r\nproceeding satisfactorily. We gratefully acknowledge the\r\nvaluable cooperation extended by the IAEA in various\r\nconstruction phases of the plant. We look forward to\r\ncontinued cooperation during the operational phase of the\r\nChashma nuclear power plant and a planned second\r\nChashma power reactor.\r\nTechnical cooperation is the backbone of the Agency’s\r\npromotional activities. We wish to congratulate the\r\nDepartment of Technical Cooperation on attaining an all-\r\ntime high implementation rate of 76.2 per cent in 1997,\r\nwhich is a tribute to the planning, management and\r\ndiligence of the Department. At the same time, we are\r\ndistressed that the Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF) target\r\npledged during the year was an all-time low of 70.2 per\r\ncent, resulting in a sharp decline in the available TCF\r\nresources as compared to 1995 and 1996.\r\nPakistan accords the highest priority to safety in its\r\nnuclear facilities, and has benefited from the nuclear\r\nsafety expertise available through the Agency. The recent\r\nentry into force of the international Convention on\r\nNuclear Safety is a welcome step. We hope that the\r\nIAEA will now ensure the fullest possible exchange of\r\nsafety-related information and the sharing of expertise.\r\nPakistan, as a State party to the Nuclear Safety\r\nConvention, will continue to cooperate with the IAEA on\r\nthis issue.\r\nImplementation of nuclear safeguards agreements\r\nconstitutes an important facet of the IAEA’s activities.\r\nWe are satisfied that during 1997 the IAEA’s vast\r\nsafeguards related activities, spreading over 900 facilities\r\nin some 70 countries and involving more than 10,000\r\nperson-days of inspection, show that the nuclear material\r\nand other items declared and placed under the Agency’s\r\nsafeguards remained in peaceful nuclear activities and\r\nwere adequately accounted for. For its part, Pakistan has\r\nfaithfully discharged its safeguards obligations under our\r\nagreements with the Agency of the INFCIRC/66 category.\r\nPakistan has noted the conclusion and approval by\r\nthe Board of Governors of the protocol additional to\r\nsafeguards agreements. The protocol is meant for\r\ncountries which have INFCIRC/153-type safeguards\r\nagreements with the Agency. Suggestions to extend the\r\nprogramme to non-full-scope safeguards countries are\r\ncontrary to the objectives and legal basis of the\r\nprogramme.\r\nAmong the technical agencies set up by the United\r\nNations, the IAEA is undoubtedly an exemplary\r\norganization in its efficiency and professionalism. It is\r\nimportant that the Agency maintain its focus on its\r\ntechnical and promotional character. Unfortunately, over\r\nthe past few years, there has been an inordinate shift\r\ntowards the verification rather than the promotional role\r\nof the IAEA. Political issues and debates have been\r\ntaking up an increasing proportion of the time and effort\r\nof the Secretariat and its policy-making organs. This trend\r\nneeds to be reversed and the balance established in the\r\nIAEA’s statute restored. Safeguards are, of course, one of\r\nthe basic functions of the Agency. We remain supportive\r\nof the cost-effective implementation of safeguards in\r\naccordance with treaties or agreements voluntarily entered\r\ninto by States. However, safeguards are not an end in\r\nthemselves. They are designed to create an enabling\r\nenvironment for the promotion of the peaceful uses of\r\natomic energy.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nThe regulatory responsibility of the Agency should not\r\nlead to the imposition of arbitrary restrictions on the\r\ntransfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\r\nUnfortunately, restrictions have been imposed, even when\r\nit is evident that no proliferation dangers are involved. At\r\ntimes, even safety-related information has been refused.\r\nThis approach is not conducive to the evolution of safer\r\ntechniques and methods, or to the promotion of greater\r\nopenness and transparency in the field of nuclear\r\ntechnology. Since these are the key objectives of the\r\nAgency, we hope that the IAEA will redouble its efforts for\r\ntheir achievement. The International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nshould strive to remove all impediments to the transfer of\r\nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\r\nWe expect the Agency to adopt non-discriminatory\r\nmeasures in providing access to nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes. The Agency’s primary purpose is to promote the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear power under technically safe\r\nconditions, not to serve as a nuclear policeman or the arm\r\nfor non-proliferation crusaders.\r\nIn this context, Pakistan regrets that certain members\r\nforced a discussion of nuclear testing in South Asia into the\r\nproceedings of the last IAEA General Conference. We have\r\nwitnessed this polemical injection in certain statements\r\nmade here as well. The IAEA’s technical expertise and\r\nhighly professional repute will suffer from recourse to such\r\npolitically motivated moves. Pakistan opposed the proposals\r\nto criticize our nuclear tests of last May. We have\r\nexplained that Pakistan was compelled to demonstrate its\r\nnuclear capacity in response to India’s earlier tests in order\r\nto maintain the credibility of nuclear deterrence which has\r\nexisted in undeclared form for over two decades in South\r\nAsia. Clearly, this issue is sought to be utilized by some\r\nStates to divert attention away from the priority goal of\r\nnuclear disarmament. Ironically, these Powers, and their\r\nfaithful allies that had sponsored the IAEA decision to\r\ncriticize the South Asian tests, themselves felt obliged to\r\nabstain in the vote on this decision because of the adoption\r\nof an amendment urging progress towards nuclear\r\ndisarmament. This unfortunate episode not only marred the\r\nproceedings of the IAEA General Conference; it revealed\r\nclearly the source of the real problem which confronts the\r\npromotion of peaceful nuclear energy — the crass\r\ndiscrimination practised by the major nuclear Powers and\r\ntheir military alliance partners. We hope that such partisan\r\npolitical games will no longer be played in the IAEA.\r\nMr. Elaraby (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nshould like to extend my thanks to the Director General of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, for the excellent manner in\r\nwhich he presented the report of the Agency this year. I\r\nwish also to congratulate him — an able Egyptian\r\ndiplomat — on the great achievements he has made in the\r\ncourse of the short period since he took office. May I also\r\nexpress our gratitude to and recognition of Mr. Hans Blix,\r\nthe previous Director General, for the great service he\r\nrendered over the year. These services contributed to\r\nstrengthening the work of the Agency.\r\nWe have studied the annual report of the Agency.\r\nEgypt attaches great importance to the safeguards regime\r\nof the IAEA to control and monitor the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear power by halting the diversion of nuclear energy\r\nto military use, through a set of rules and inspection\r\ncriteria to be applied by the Agency, including the\r\nverification activities of 1997.\r\nDespite the fact that the Agency’s efforts in the field\r\nof verification and compliance and the fact that its Board\r\nof Governors adopted in May 1997 what is known as the\r\n93+2 system, which provides the legal basis required for\r\nstrengthening the Agency’s ability to detect undeclared\r\nnuclear material and activities, there is a nuclear\r\nprogramme at the eastern borders of Egypt not subjected\r\nto these safeguards. This creates a very dangerous\r\nsituation for the whole region, and threatens it with\r\ndisastrous consequences unless the Agency and the\r\ninternational community endeavour to avert such a\r\ndisaster. Despite international alarm vis-à-vis the latest\r\ndevelopments in South Asia, those developments should\r\nnot lessen the gravity of the situation in the Middle East.\r\nThis is due to Israel’s non-accession to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its\r\nrefusal to subject its nuclear facilities to the Agency’s\r\ncomprehensive safeguards. This calls for intensive\r\ninternational efforts, both at the United Nations and at the\r\nAgency, to compel Israel to accede to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to\r\nsubject all its nuclear facilities to the Agency’s\r\ncomprehensive safeguards, as a natural beginning of a\r\nMiddle East free of nuclear weapons. In this context,\r\nEgypt encourages the Agency to take tenacious, vigorous\r\nsteps to pave the way for appropriate regional\r\narrangements to make the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone, an initiative we have supported since 1974.\r\nThere is no doubt that the workshop on safeguards\r\nand verification technology, held in May 1998 in response\r\nto a request made by Egypt at the forty-first session of\r\nthe General Conference, reflects the Agency’s ongoing\r\nimplementation of its decision regarding the application\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nof safeguards in the Middle East. The agenda of the\r\nworkshop was somewhat disappointing, as it focused on\r\ngeneral and technical aspects of verification without\r\nproviding direction to such activities or even linking them\r\nto the Middle East, which diverted the attention of the\r\nworkshop from its main objectives. In spite of that, the\r\nconvening of the workshop and other similar activities\r\nspecifically orienting them to address areas of disagreement\r\ncan advance the application of Agency safeguards in the\r\nMiddle East. Hence the Agency should continue to convene\r\nsuch meetings and should rationalize their agendas with a\r\nview to reaching the desired goals.\r\nWith these considerations in mind, Egypt holds a\r\nposition of principle on the question of nuclear weapons in\r\nthe Middle East, based on our conviction that removing the\r\ndanger of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction\r\nin the Middle East is the way to achieve real peace in that\r\nregion. It would also serve the interests of all its peoples\r\nand would enhance good-neighbourliness and regional\r\npeace and security. It would undoubtedly be an important\r\nmeasure to build confidence among the States of the region.\r\nI refer here to the April 1990 initiative of President\r\nMohamed Hosni Mubarak to rid the Middle East of all\r\nweapons of mass destruction, and to his June 1998\r\nannouncement of a more comprehensive initiative: to rid the\r\nentire world of weapons of mass destruction in view of the\r\nthreat posed by such weapons and the need to enhance\r\ninternational peace and security. President Mubarak also\r\ncalled for the convening of an international conference with\r\nthe purpose of reaching that goal within a defined time-\r\nframe. Egypt will work to give timely effect to these\r\ninitiatives.\r\nThe Agency has made an enormous effort to transfer\r\npeaceful nuclear technologies to developing countries\r\nthrough its technical cooperation programme with its\r\nmember States. In that connection, we have studied the\r\nAgency’s 1997 report as it relates to such technical\r\ncooperation activities. Egypt attaches great importance to\r\nnon-proliferation, within the framework of various Agency\r\nactivities, and considers that technical cooperation\r\ncomplements the Agency’s activities and enhances its\r\ncredibility. It is also part and parcel of the Agency’s efforts\r\nto promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and,\r\nconsequently, the efforts of the international community to\r\ncurb the non-peaceful uses of that energy. In that\r\nconnection, I note our concern at the crisis in implementing\r\nthe Agency’s technical cooperation programme, and\r\ntherefore appeal to donor States to give this matter\r\nparticular attention in order to strengthen the role of the\r\nAgency in technical cooperation for peaceful purposes.\r\nLet me turn now to the Agency’s activities with\r\nrespect to Iraq. I shall refer here to the most recent status\r\nreport of the Director General of the Agency,\r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, to the Security Council. In this\r\ncontext, I reiterate our firm position on this matter: Iraq\r\nmust cooperate fully both with the Agency and with the\r\nUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM). This\r\nwould make it possible to close the file of weapons\r\nprohibited under part C of Security Council resolution\r\n687 (1991) by the terms of paragraph 22 of that\r\nresolution. That would help towards lifting the sanctions\r\nthat have been imposed on Iraq for more than seven years\r\nand that have inflicted harsh human suffering on the Iraqi\r\npeople. The report of the Director General clearly states\r\nthat\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“There are no indications that there remains in\r\nIraq any physical capability for the production of\r\nweapon-usable nuclear material of any practical\r\nsignificance.” (S/1998/694, annex, appendix,\r\nenclosure I, para. 77)\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nThose words are self-explanatory. It is perfectly clear and\r\nperfectly logical that without Iraq’s cooperation the\r\nAgency would not have been able to arrive at that degree\r\nof certainty in its conclusion. It is time for the entire\r\nnuclear file to be moved to the status of ongoing\r\nmonitoring and verification.\r\nThere is another topic I wish to address today, even\r\nthough it does not fall within the framework of the report\r\nof the Agency. It goes, however, to the essence of the\r\nAgency’s work and its ability to contend with the\r\nchanging international political scene. I refer to amending\r\narticle VI of the statute of the Agency, which relates to\r\nexpanding the membership of the Board of Governors. On\r\nseveral occasions Egypt has stressed that it is a matter of\r\nurgency to expand the Board so that it can reflect the\r\ngreat increase in the membership of the Agency. If this is\r\ndone, it will strengthen the administrative, technical and\r\npolitical authority of the Board of Governors in adopting\r\ndecisions that command the broadest possible acceptance\r\nby the international community. Highlighting this issue,\r\nthe IAEA General Conference has adopted a resolution\r\nnoting that Africa, the Middle East and South Asia were\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nunder-represented on the Board, and that this matter should\r\nbe redressed. Expansion of the Board of Governors is a\r\nmatter of urgency and of increasing importance; it would\r\ncontribute to an increase of benefits to developing countries\r\nand to their wider participation in the work of the Agency.\r\nThis would have a positive impact on the performance of\r\nthe Agency itself. It would be best to settle this matter in\r\na comprehensive and just manner so as to avoid reverting\r\nto the subject of Board expansion again in the future.\r\nEgypt’s election to membership of the Board of\r\nGovernors at the forty-second session of the General\r\nConference highlights the active role my country plays in\r\nthe field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. During its\r\ntenure, Egypt will continue to work energetically to\r\nenhance the endeavours and activities of the Agency for the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy and for making them\r\navailable to developing countries through the technical\r\ncooperation programme of the Agency.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): Let me begin by expressing\r\nmy Government’s gratitude for the important work carried\r\nout by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\nduring 1997 and during the first part of 1998. We commend\r\nthe Director General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, and the\r\nAgency’s secretariat and other staff for their commitment\r\nand professionalism in carrying out an extensive\r\nprogramme under resource constraints.\r\nWe are confident that under the leadership of\r\nMr. ElBaradei, whose vast experience and skills are well\r\nknown to us all, the Agency will make significant progress\r\ntowards its two main objectives — the promotion of the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy and safeguarding against the\r\nuse of nuclear material for military purposes.\r\nWe welcome the report of the IAEA to the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly, as it provides us with a\r\nvaluable opportunity to review the Agency’s activities and\r\nto evaluate their impact in the areas which the Agency is\r\nactively engaged in.\r\nSince its establishment, the IAEA has worked to\r\npromote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It has played\r\nand continues to play a crucial role in expanding\r\ncooperation among member States to this end. The IAEA’s\r\nrole as a central medium for the transfer and application of\r\nnuclear technology has contributed to the economic\r\ndevelopment of member States. We fully support the\r\nAgency’s view that encouraging nuclear technology transfer\r\nfor exclusively peaceful purposes is an integral part of the\r\ninternational consensus relating to the peaceful use of\r\nnuclear energy that is embodied in the IAEA statute and\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT).\r\nArmenia’s policy with respect to nuclear and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction is clear and consistent. It is\r\nbased on a serious and genuine commitment to the\r\nobjectives and principles of non-proliferation. In order to\r\nfurther ensure the implementation of the NPT, States\r\nparties must continue to abide by the safeguards system\r\nof the IAEA. Armenia supports the strengthening and\r\nimprovement of the effectiveness of the safeguards regime\r\nby introducing the protocol additional to safeguards\r\nagreements based on the text of the Model Protocol\r\napproved by the IAEA Board of Governors in 1997. We\r\nare proud to state that Armenia has become the first State\r\nwith an operating power plant to sign the protocol\r\nadditional to its safeguards agreement.\r\nEncouraging an increasing number of States\r\ncommitted to non-proliferation to sign the protocol would\r\nserve two purposes: one, to subject the portion of the\r\nworld’s nuclear fuel cycle currently under the Agency’s\r\ncomprehensive safeguards to a further strengthened\r\nsystem of safeguards; and, two, to exert requisite\r\ninfluence on the States which are prone to pursuing\r\nundeclared nuclear activities, with a view to their eventual\r\nadoption of this new norm.\r\nArmenia attaches great importance to cooperation in\r\nthe field of peaceful energy use and nuclear safety. In this\r\ncontext, I am pleased to announce that during the forty-\r\nsecond General Conference the delegation of Armenia\r\ndeposited Armenia’s instrument of ratification of the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety. Nuclear safety is a\r\nfundamental issue. Universal recognition of the\r\nimportance of implementing the provisions of the\r\nConvention at national, regional and international levels\r\nwill promote and maintain the highest standards of safety.\r\nIt is in the interests of us all that those States that have\r\nnot yet signed and ratified the Convention do so at the\r\nearliest possible date. We also look forward to actively\r\nparticipating in the first Review Meeting of the\r\nConvention in April 1999.\r\nArmenia considers the IAEA as a key partner in\r\ndeveloping its programme of peaceful nuclear energy. The\r\nIAEA has made a significant contribution to the\r\nreactivation of one of the units of the Medzamor nuclear\r\npower plant. We would also like to commend the Agency\r\nfor its ongoing assistance in ensuring the plant’s safe\r\noperation. The IAEA’s assistance in enhancing the\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nseismic safety of the Medzamor nuclear power plant is of\r\nspecial importance to us. As a national coordinator of\r\ntechnical cooperation programmes, the National Regulatory\r\nAuthority oversees the activities of Armenia’s agencies and\r\norganizations that are engaged in projects under the\r\nauspices of the IAEA. Under the technical cooperation\r\nprogramme, Armenia is currently implementing eight\r\nnational and nine regional projects that are aimed in\r\nparticular at the strengthening of the safety of the\r\nMedzamor nuclear power plant.\r\nArmenia and the IAEA are working together on the\r\nelaboration of the technical cooperation programme for\r\n1999-2000. We continue to view the IAEA technical\r\ncooperation programme as an integral part of the Agency’s\r\nactivities contributing to sustainable development. We hope\r\nthat the donor States will continue to make contributions to\r\nthe Technical Cooperation Fund in order to further assist\r\nthe newly independent States in strengthening their national\r\ninfrastructures, training the specialists required for the safe\r\nutilization of nuclear energy and bringing their operational\r\nstandards into compliance with the current requirements of\r\nthe IAEA.\r\nArmenia values cooperation with IAEA member\r\nStates. Under the aegis of the IAEA, Armenia is expanding\r\ncooperation with the Russian Federation, the United States,\r\nthe member States of the European Union — particularly\r\nFrance and Germany — and with Argentina and Slovakia,\r\nas well as other partner countries. Cooperation with our\r\npartners includes implementation of joint projects on\r\nnuclear safety research and sustainable development,\r\nexchange of technical information, improvement of\r\noperational safety standards and radiation protection at\r\nnuclear power plants, seismic safety and the training of\r\ntechnical personnel.\r\nWe are concerned about the possible negative impact\r\nof nuclear tests in South Asia on the international non-\r\nproliferation regime. We are pleased to hear that no further\r\nnuclear tests are planned and that both States have shown\r\ntheir intention to accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT), thereby enabling the Treaty to\r\nenter into force. We are convinced that the entry into force\r\nof the CTBT and the successful conclusion of a fissile\r\nmaterial cut-off treaty will greatly enhance international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure the Director\r\nGeneral of my country’s full cooperation in his work to\r\nfurther the goals of the IAEA. We hope that draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.18, of which Armenia is a sponsor, will be\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Valle (Brazil) (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the delegations of the member countries of the\r\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) —\r\nArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — and the\r\ndelegations of the associated States of Bolivia and Chile,\r\nwe wish to express our satisfaction with the report\r\nsubmitted by the Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei.\r\nWe would once again like to highlight the\r\nimportance we attach to the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency as the promoter of the use of nuclear energy for\r\nexclusively peaceful purposes and its key role in the\r\ninternational nuclear non-proliferation regime, whose\r\nprogress should further extend the tasks of the Agency in\r\nthe not too distant future. Similarly, the member and\r\nassociated countries of MERCOSUR would again like to\r\nreiterate our full commitment to the safeguards regime\r\napplied and administered by the IAEA.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the growing and positive\r\ninteraction between the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for\r\nAccounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC)\r\nand the IAEA, recently reflected in the technical\r\ncooperation agreement signed by both Agencies in May\r\n1998. We also deem it worth recalling that Argentina and\r\nBrazil have offered to share with other countries their\r\nexperience in creating and setting up the ABACC as a\r\ncontribution to the international non-proliferation regime.\r\nIn this context, we are pleased with the conclusion\r\nof the agreement on cooperation for the promotion of\r\nnuclear science and technology in Latin America, a\r\nspecific instrument to multilaterally channel cooperation\r\nfor the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the Latin\r\nAmerican region. Likewise, we look forward with interest\r\nto the conclusions of the senior group of experts on the\r\npossible courses of action for the general programme and\r\npriorities of the Agency in the future, which will be\r\nconsidered by the Board of Governors at their meeting\r\nnext March.\r\nIn conclusion, the member and associate countries of\r\nMERCOSUR wish once again to highlight the laudable\r\nwork carried out by the Agency in applying safeguards\r\nand in international cooperation. We also wish to reiterate\r\nour thanks for the full report made available to us for our\r\nconsideration.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nMr. Dausá Céspedes (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Before I delve into the subject of concern today,\r\nallow me to express Cuba’s deepest condolences and full\r\nsolidarity at the loss of life and property in the fraternal\r\nCentral American countries as a result of the scourge of\r\nHurricane Mitch.\r\nI should like at the outset to thank the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\r\nfor his report.\r\nCuba sees as positive the modest yet tangible advances\r\nachieved in the area of technical cooperation by the IAEA\r\nin recent years, including the efforts carried out by the\r\nAgency’s Department of Technical Cooperation Department\r\nto increase its effectiveness and efficiency.\r\nDevelopment, promotion and technical cooperation\r\nactivities should not only be maintained but strengthened on\r\na yearly basis because they form the cornerstone of the\r\nAgency’s raison d’être. Our experience of the past 40 years\r\nand of the past few decades in particular has made clear the\r\nlimitless possibilities offered by the appropriate use of\r\nnuclear technology. These include much higher-yielding or\r\ndisease-resistant plant varieties, pathogen-free food and\r\nmore efficient methods for diagnosing widespread illnesses,\r\nto mention but a few.\r\nCuba, as many other countries, has benefited from\r\ntechnical cooperation with the IAEA. We continue also to\r\nmake a practical contribution to furthering that cooperation.\r\nWe have provided experts to other countries in various\r\nareas; we have made our facilities available for the training\r\nof foreign specialists; and certain Cuban products have even\r\nbeen used in international cooperation projects in the area\r\nof the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nCuba is concerned at the positions taken by some\r\ndeveloped countries that are aimed at minimizing the\r\nimportance of cooperation issues and even reducing their\r\ncontributions to the IAEA Technical Cooperation Fund. The\r\nannual report of the Agency for 1997, which the Assembly\r\nwill take note of today, reflects the difficult situation faced\r\nin the past year regarding funding to implement the planned\r\ncooperation programme. The figures for the 1999-2000\r\nbiennium do not cover actual needs, and it has not even\r\nbeen possible to determine approximate figures for the\r\n2000-2001 biennium.\r\nA priority challenge for the Agency in the immediate\r\nfuture must be the adoption of a comprehensive and\r\neffective programme to strengthen technical cooperation\r\nsimilar to the one adopted to increase the effectiveness\r\nand efficiency of safeguards.\r\nWe in the Latin American and Caribbean region\r\nwelcome the entry into force of the governmental\r\nagreement to support the programme on Regional\r\nCooperative Arrangements for the Promotion of Nuclear\r\nScience and Technology in Latin America (ARCAL).\r\nCuba is pleased that preparations for this agreement took\r\nplace at the meeting of the leading nuclear authorities of\r\nthe member countries of ARCAL, held in Havana last\r\nyear.\r\nDespite the strong rejection expressed by many\r\nStates for activities of this kind, unfortunately there are\r\ncountries that are not even concerned with the most\r\nfundamental principles of international coexistence and\r\nthat attempt to manipulate international agencies based on\r\nnarrow political interests. Last week the Government of\r\nthe United States adopted an omnibus bill on\r\nappropriations, of which two full sections — 2809 and\r\n2810 — are devoted entirely to detailing various ways to\r\nboycott the Cuban nuclear programmes, and in particular\r\ncooperation between the IAEA and Cuba. Those sections\r\nalso provide for a reduction in assistance funds for third\r\ncountries commensurate with the resources they supply to\r\nCuba’s nuclear programme, despite the fact that it has\r\nstrictly peaceful purposes. Actions of this nature are\r\nreprehensible and are categorically rejected by my\r\ncountry.\r\nCuba recognizes the efforts made to strengthen the\r\nIAEA safeguards regime, which culminated in the\r\nadoption of the Model Additional Protocol last year. We\r\nhope that the Agency will continue to advance along this\r\ndifficult path, taking due note of the legitimate concerns\r\nof States and rigorously ensuring that safeguards activities\r\ndo not become an unacceptable financial burden for\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn this context, I wish to reiterate my country’s\r\nserious reservations as to the non-proliferation regime\r\nbased on the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which some\r\nattempt to use as a model. Cuba believes that the NPT is\r\na selective and discriminatory non-proliferation regime\r\nthat establishes different categories of States with\r\ndifferent rights and obligations. Paradoxically, in\r\naccordance with this Treaty non-nuclear-weapon States\r\nmust comply with strict verification requirements that do\r\nnot apply to the nuclear-weapon States. These are the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nreasons of principle that have kept my country from signing\r\nthe NPT.\r\nA firm commitment to nuclear disarmament and\r\ncommitment to the use of nuclear energy for strictly\r\npeaceful purposes will continue to be basic principles of\r\nCuba’s foreign policy.\r\nAs a fresh gesture of goodwill, the Government of\r\nCuba has decided to initiate talks with the secretariat of the\r\nIAEA to consider the possibility of incorporating in our\r\nsafeguards agreements with the Agency some of the\r\nmeasures that have been contemplated in the Model\r\nAdditional Protocol.\r\nOnce again, controversial wording on specific\r\ncountries or situations has been included in the draft\r\nresolution on the report of the IAEA. It is disturbing that\r\nthis has become the practice in recent years, despite the fact\r\nthat this procedure does not have the support of all\r\ndelegations. Since this Agency is of such great importance\r\nfor the international community, the text submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the work of the IAEA should reflect\r\nthose issues that receive consensus support from\r\ndelegations, as is the case for other texts adopted on other\r\nbodies or forums.\r\nWe hope that in future these concerns will duly be\r\ntaken into account, and we take this opportunity to express\r\nour position of unanimous support for the work of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nMr. Reva (Ukraine): On behalf of the Ukrainian\r\ndelegation, I would like to thank Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei,\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), for his comprehensive introduction of the\r\nAgency’s report to the Assembly and also congratulate him\r\non the assumption of his very important position. We wish\r\nhim every success in further promoting the noble goals of\r\nthe IAEA.\r\nSince its establishment more than 40 years ago, the\r\nIAEA has made a unique contribution to promoting the\r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy and to setting international\r\nstandards for nuclear safety and the management of\r\nradioactive wastes. Thanks to its technical cooperation\r\nprogrammes, know-how on nuclear applications in such\r\ndiverse areas as agriculture, health, industry and water-\r\nresources management has become available to a growing\r\nnumber of countries. Today the Agency continues to play\r\nan indispensable role in strengthening the nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime.\r\nHowever, recent developments in the sphere of non-\r\nproliferation cannot but cause legitimate concern to the\r\nStates parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) regarding the viability of the\r\nnon-proliferation regime, and necessitate concerted action\r\nby them to further strengthen this regime. Therefore,\r\nUkraine welcomes the recent accessions to the Treaty and\r\nappeals to those few States that remain outside the NPT\r\nto accede to it as soon as possible.\r\nThe safeguards systems are an integral element of\r\nthe non-proliferation regime, and our goal should be the\r\napplication of strengthened safeguards in all States.\r\nUkraine ratified the comprehensive safeguards agreement\r\nwith the IAEA on 17 December 1997.\r\nWe also believe that the new Model Protocol\r\nAdditional to Safeguards Agreements will provide the\r\nAgency with stronger tools to verify compliance with the\r\nNPT. We are continuing to work in order to conclude the\r\nadditional protocol as soon as possible.\r\nThe role of the IAEA in the field of nuclear and\r\nradiation safety is indisputable. Ukraine notes with\r\nsatisfaction the Agency’s efforts to enhance the safety of\r\nnuclear power plants in Central and Eastern Europe. It is\r\nquite obvious that this is a long-term task, but we should\r\npursue it with no less determination than any other.\r\nOn 7 July 1998 the Vienna Convention on Nuclear\r\nSafety entered into force in Ukraine. As per its\r\ncommitments, my country has transmitted to the States\r\nparties for their consideration the national report on\r\nUkraine’s fulfilment of its obligations under the\r\nConvention. We attach particular importance to the\r\nConvention’s first review meeting, which will take place\r\nnext spring.\r\nUkraine’s delegation notes with satisfaction our\r\ncountry’s broadening technical cooperation with the\r\nIAEA, which embraces basic activities in the peaceful use\r\nof nuclear energy. We are also satisfied with the progress\r\non implementation of technical assistance projects in\r\nUkraine as well as with the broad involvement of our\r\nrepresentatives in the Agency’s regional technical\r\nassistance projects. All these projects are of great\r\npractical importance for our country.\r\nThe problem of the safety of the Chernobyl nuclear\r\npower plant continues to remain a focus of attention for\r\nUkraine’s Government and the whole international\r\ncommunity. In this respect, let me briefly inform the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nAssembly about the progress achieved in implementing the\r\nmemorandum of understanding between the G-7, the\r\nEuropean Commission and Ukraine that was signed in\r\nOttawa in December 1995.\r\nUnit 1 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was shut\r\ndown in 1996. The preparation work for extracting the\r\nnuclear fuel from this unit is now under way. We also\r\nattach special attention to the work on the shelter\r\nconstruction over destroyed unit 4 within the framework of\r\nthe memorandum.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation highly appreciates the\r\ndecisions of the pledging conference convened last year\r\nhere in New York. We are grateful to the G-7\r\nGovernments, the European Commission and Governments\r\nof other donor States, including most recently the\r\nGovernment of the Slovak Republic, for their pledges for\r\nthe realization of the shelter implementation plan.\r\nThe decisions of the pledging conference have given\r\na strong impetus to the practical steps aimed at the\r\nfulfilment of the memorandum. In this context, I also wish\r\nto mention that the framework agreement between Ukraine\r\nand the European Bank for Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment (EBRD) relating to the activities of the\r\nChernobyl shelter fund in Ukraine has been signed and has\r\nentered into force. The structure of the fund has been\r\nshaped, the mechanism for payments developed and the\r\ngoverning board of the project management unit elected,\r\nand tenders on certain groups of projects are in progress.\r\nPresently, more than $390 million have been pledged\r\nto the Chernobyl shelter fund, and some $200 million have\r\nalready been credited to the relevant EBRD account.\r\nHowever, $750 million are still needed to complete the\r\nshelter implementation plan. In this respect, we hope that\r\nthese funds will be collected at the second pledging\r\nconference.\r\nThe memorandum provides that the completion of\r\nconstruction of compensatory power units is among the\r\npreconditions for the decommissioning of the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant. The delay in putting into operation the\r\nunits at the Rivne and Khmel’nitskiy nuclear power plants\r\nis of particular concern to our Government. In view of the\r\npresent situation, we must also state that Ukraine will be\r\nable to complete these energy units only on the condition\r\nthat the G-7 and the European Community member States\r\ntake appropriate emergency steps aimed at securing the\r\nnecessary financial resources for this purpose. Otherwise,\r\nthe failure of the achieved agreements regarding Chernobyl\r\nwould produce a negative reaction both in Ukraine and in\r\nother States, as well as adversely affecting our common\r\ncause of the safe utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful\r\npurposes. Only by joint efforts will we be able to\r\neliminate the Chernobyl problem.\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency is widely\r\nregarded as a model organization. We are confident that\r\nthe initiative of the Director General to set up a senior\r\nexpert group to look at all aspects of the Agency’s\r\nactivities will strengthen this view. We believe that the\r\nIAEA can look forward to the new millennium with\r\noptimism. I wish to conclude by reiterating Ukraine’s\r\ncommitment to the Agency’s goals.\r\nMr. Sychou (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nOur delegation would like to express its gratitude to the\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA), Mr. ElBaradei, for the Agency’s annual\r\nreport on its activities.\r\nSince its establishment, the IAEA has been called\r\nupon to deal successfully with such important\r\ninternational challenges as ensuring nuclear safety and\r\norganizing technical assistance to States so that they can\r\ndevelop nuclear research programmes. The Agency has\r\nmade a significant contribution to dealing successfully\r\nwith these challenges and has shown itself to be a reliable\r\ninternational organization which promotes the\r\nstrengthening of inter-State cooperation on issues\r\npertaining to the peaceful uses of atomic energy.\r\nAchieving comprehensive compliance with the\r\nprinciples of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is one\r\nof the main priorities of our Government’s foreign policy.\r\nIn this connection, we should add that Belarus attaches\r\ngreat significance to IAEA activities in this area.\r\nBelarus is taking consistent steps towards becoming\r\na non-nuclear State. It has ratified the Treaty on the\r\nReduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms\r\nand has adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear State. It has\r\nsigned a safeguards agreement with the IAEA. Another\r\nimportant milestone for Belarus in this regard was the\r\nsigning of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT).\r\nAt the end of April 1992 Belarus withdrew tactical\r\nnuclear weapons, ahead of schedule, from its territory,\r\nand in 1996 the Republic complied with the timetable for\r\nthe withdrawal of nuclear strategic weapons. In this way,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nthe entire space of Central and Eastern Europe has been\r\nfreed of nuclear weapons.\r\nIn this connection, we see it as essential to establish\r\na non-nuclear space in Central Europe, which would enable\r\nus to consolidate the already existing non-nuclear\r\nobligations of States in the region and prevent the\r\npossibility of a new geographical spread of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nThe term “space” lends some flexibility to that idea.\r\nWe believe that the “non-nuclear space” could be based on\r\na balanced combination of legal and political, multilateral\r\nand unilateral obligations of States. It could have the\r\nparticipation of such countries as those which link their\r\nsecurity to membership of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO), as well as neutral States. To some\r\nextent, those members of NATO having a special position\r\nwith regard to nuclear weapons could join in this space.\r\nWe would especially like to emphasize that the only\r\nobjective of this initiative was to find solutions to questions\r\non the establishment and strengthening of pan-European\r\nsecurity, and consequently international security. In this\r\nconnection, the interests of all European States and security\r\nstructures will be taken into account.\r\nBelarus attaches great significance to the strengthening\r\nof the international safeguards system and is making every\r\neffort to strictly comply with the obligations it has entered\r\ninto to ensure reliable protection for nuclear materials. The\r\ndonor countries — the United States of America, Japan and\r\nSweden — with coordination from the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, are lending Belarus significant technical\r\nassistance in establishing and improving on the\r\nGovernment’s system of accounting and monitoring of\r\nnuclear materials.\r\nMeasurement systems have been established which\r\nallow us not only to take stock of nuclear materials but also\r\nto carry out studies and monitor transit of materials through\r\nthe territory of the Republic. Like the majority of other\r\nStates, Belarus is participating in the implementation of the\r\nfirst part of the Programme 93 + 2, giving the Agency a\r\nlarger scope of information on nuclear activities and\r\nensuring access for inspectors.\r\nIn 1997 the IAEA prepared the protocol additional to\r\nthe safeguards agreement. Currently, Belarusian experts are\r\nundertaking a detailed study of the protocol. The need for\r\nsuch in-depth study is conditioned by the complexities of\r\nsuch tasks as providing sensitive information, which, in the\r\nfinal analysis, might affect the sovereignty of our State.\r\nAt the same time, we would like to emphasize that many\r\nof the steps provided for in the protocol require individual\r\nconsultations with interested States. By way of example,\r\nI could talk about agreed upon problems involving a\r\nbreakdown analysis of nuclear material samples and\r\nswabs from hot chambers.\r\nBelarus has seen from its own experience that any\r\naccident at a nuclear power plant is trans-border in nature.\r\nAt the same time, we should take into account the fact\r\nthat our Republic has nuclear power stations on its\r\nborders as well. In this context, recognizing the role and\r\nsignificance of the amended Protocol to the Vienna\r\nConvention, as worked out by the IAEA in respect to\r\ncivil liability for nuclear damage, our country, having\r\nsigned this Protocol, has taken yet another step in\r\nsupporting closer international cooperation in the nuclear\r\nsphere at the political and industrial levels.\r\nI would also like to point out that currently the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Belarus is studying another\r\nimportant document to strengthen the safeguards regime:\r\nthe Convention on Nuclear Safety. Our Government\r\nattaches great importance to ensuring maximum radiation\r\nsafety for the population of the country — which on a\r\ndaily basis has to cope with the painful consequences of\r\nthe Chernobyl accident.\r\nVarious steps are being taken to strengthen all\r\naspects of radiation safety. In January 1998 a law was\r\nadopted on radiation safety for the population. This law\r\nsets out the rights and obligations of citizens subjected to\r\nradiation for medical purposes, as well as the rights and\r\nobligations of citizens exposed to radon, a natural source\r\nof radiation.\r\nIn addition, a draft law has been put forward for the\r\nconsideration of the Belarus Parliament on the use of\r\natomic energy and on radiation protection, a law which,\r\namong other things, covers such subjects as material\r\nresponsibility borne by those using sources of ionizing\r\nradiation.\r\nOne of the priority areas in the activities of our State\r\nin ensuring radiation safety for the population is solving\r\nthe problem of the safety of waste, a problem which\r\nemerged in the initial period following the accident at\r\nChernobyl. Work has been concluded on modernizing and\r\ncertifying the facilities for the maintenance and\r\npreservation of waste, and also to define the radionuclide\r\ncomponents of nuclear waste. In this connection, the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nIAEA’s project, “Rehabilitation of EKORES radioactive\r\nwaste disposal facility”, is an important initiative.\r\nBelarus notes with satisfaction the significant\r\nexpansion of its relations with the IAEA in the area of\r\ntechnical cooperation in recent years. The policy of\r\nimproving approaches of the Agency in its lending of\r\ntechnical assistance — taking into account national interests\r\nof States and the quality of the choice of projects chosen\r\nfor their orientation towards the final user — significantly\r\nenhances the effectiveness of these plans. The Republic of\r\nBelarus supported the initiative of the IAEA on the joint\r\nrealization of a pilot project to improve the infrastructure\r\nfor radiation safety and waste management, and is pleased\r\nat the course of its implementation.\r\nThe involvement in this project of the plans to protect\r\nthe population from ionized radiation of other countries in\r\nthe region gives the project a regional nature, something\r\nwhich can serve as an additional impulse for development\r\nof bilateral contacts of States of the region in this area.\r\nOne important example of close and effective\r\ncooperation between Belarus and the IAEA is the\r\nimplementation in Belarus of the project on the cultivation\r\nof rapeseed oil in radionuclide-contaminated areas.\r\nEconomic gains produced by this initially small-scale\r\nproject compelled Belarus and the IAEA to conclude an\r\nagreement in 1997 on the cultivation of rapeseed and the\r\nproduction of biolubricants from rapeseeds.\r\nThe cleaning up of the lands affected by the\r\nChernobyl accident, and the commercial effect of the\r\nproducts which have been cultivated, involve a combination\r\nof humanitarian, economic and commercial interests.\r\nAnother example of active cooperation with the IAEA is\r\nthe project to modernize and enhance the quality of\r\nradioactive metrology and standardization, in the course of\r\nwhich we plan to establish a system of accreditation and\r\ncertification, as well as secondary standards.\r\nIn the near future, major priorities for Belarus, along\r\nwith the matters I have mentioned, remain the development\r\nof cooperation with the IAEA in improving nuclear\r\nmedicine, the effective use of the territory affected by the\r\nChernobyl catastrophe, and the establishment of a reliable\r\nsystem of emergency planning and operational reaction to\r\nnuclear accidents, in keeping with the spirit of the\r\nprogramme for sustainable development of our country in\r\nthe next millennium.\r\nIn conclusion, the Belarusian delegation would like\r\nto express its positive view of the work of the Agency\r\nand support priority areas of its future activities. We\r\nexpress the hope that there will be close cooperation with\r\nthe Agency in solving all problems pertaining to the\r\npeaceful uses of atomic energy.\r\nMr. Hughes (New Zealand): I shall be very brief.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to the Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Mohamed\r\nElBaradei, for his introduction of the Agency’s report and\r\nfor his skilled leadership of the Agency over the past\r\nyear.\r\nIt is of great satisfaction to New Zealand that the\r\nAgency, under Mr. ElBaradei, continues to work in an\r\nefficient manner in support of nuclear non-proliferation,\r\nincluding through the extension of the IAEA safeguards\r\nsystem, and also in practical ways to enhance nuclear\r\nsafety.\r\nNew Zealand regards the IAEA safeguards system as\r\nof paramount importance in fulfilling the IAEA’s mission\r\nto ensure that nuclear energy is used exclusively for\r\npeaceful purposes. Having signed an additional protocol\r\nwith the Agency during the General Conference in Vienna\r\nin September, New Zealand is now one of 33 countries to\r\nhave concluded additional protocols to their original\r\nsafeguards agreements. New Zealand’s additional protocol\r\ncame into effect immediately.\r\nThe safeguards system is also fundamental to the\r\nentire nuclear non-proliferation regime, which has as its\r\ncornerstone the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons. We reject strongly any suggestion that\r\nthe Agency does not or should not have a role in\r\ncountering nuclear proliferation.\r\nNew Zealand shares with many States the view that\r\nthe nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan\r\nconstitute a severe threat to the nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime and to the prospects for nuclear disarmament.\r\nNew Zealand condemned these tests, as it has done in the\r\ncase of all nuclear tests. Indications made recently in the\r\nGeneral Assembly regarding signature of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) offer\r\nsome encouragement, but we need deeds, not words,\r\nwhen it comes to international norms and non-\r\nproliferation. We urge India and Pakistan to stop their\r\nnuclear weapon development, to sign and ratify the CTBT\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nwithout delay and without condition, and to adhere to the\r\nNPT as non-nuclear-weapon States.\r\nIt is clear that the IAEA must also continue to play a\r\nsignificant role in Iraq with a view to compiling the kind of\r\nclean bill of health that will enable that country to rejoin\r\nthe international community. But it is equally evident that\r\nthis will only happen with the full cooperation of Iraq. It is\r\ntherefore of serious concern to New Zealand that the\r\nDirector General has once again had to report that the\r\nAgency’s inability to inspect new sites seriously weakens\r\nthe ongoing monitoring and verification plan and the\r\nassurances the Agency is able to give. We support the\r\nunequivocal position taken by the Security Council in\r\ndemanding that Iraq resume full cooperation with the IAEA\r\nand with the United Nations Special Commission.\r\nIt is New Zealand’s view that the safeguards\r\nagreement between the IAEA and the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea remains legally binding and in force. We\r\nnoted with disappointment that the eleventh round of\r\ntechnical consultations held between the parties in October\r\nhas again seen little progress. We urge the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to make available the\r\ninformation that is required to verify the completeness and\r\ncorrectness of its initial declaration.\r\nNew Zealand also commends the Director General for\r\nhis willingness to plan ahead for the Agency’s future. We\r\nregard such forward thinking as important, especially in the\r\ncontext of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament\r\non fissile materials early next year. New Zealand sees the\r\nAgency as having an integral part to play in the verification\r\narrangements for such a new treaty and we will continue to\r\ntake a keen interest in this and other aspects of the\r\nAgency’s future work programme.\r\nFinally, New Zealand remains a committed supporter\r\nof the Agency and its works, not all of which I have, of\r\ncourse, touched on today. We therefore offer the Director\r\nGeneral and the draft resolution before us in document\r\nA/53/L.18 our full support.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI call on the representative of Slovenia to introduce a\r\nrevision to draft resolution A/53/L.18.\r\nMr. Türk (Slovenia): On behalf of the sponsors, I\r\nhave the honour to inform the members of the General\r\nAssembly of a revision to the draft resolution contained\r\nin document A/53/L.18.\r\nWhen introducing the draft resolution this morning,\r\nthe sponsors were of the view that it accurately reflected\r\nthe activities of the Agency in the year under review. The\r\nsponsors also believed that the content of the draft\r\nresolution was balanced and that the concerns of different\r\nmembers were duly taken care of.\r\nHowever, the wish of the sponsors is to get the\r\nbroadest possible support for the draft resolution.\r\nTherefore, we studied carefully the amendment to\r\noperative paragraph 7 of the draft resolution, proposed by\r\nthe delegation of Iraq in document A/53/L.19. Following\r\nnegotiations of cosponsors and interested delegations with\r\nthe delegation of Iraq, the sponsors are now proposing a\r\nrevision to operative paragraph 7.\r\nThe revision to operative paragraph 7 is as follows.\r\nIn the last line of the paragraph, the word “few” should\r\nbe inserted before the word “remaining”. The last two\r\nlines of operative paragraph 7 will now read as follows:\r\n“and stresses that greater transparency by Iraq would\r\ncontribute greatly to the resolution of the few\r\nremaining questions and concerns;”.\r\nThe sponsors agreed on this revision on the\r\nunderstanding that the delegation of Iraq will withdraw its\r\namendment, as contained in document A/53/L.19.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Iraq regarding the possible\r\nwithdrawal of draft resolution A/53/L.19.\r\nMr. Al-Hitti (Iraq): In the spirit of compromise and\r\nin the light of the revision just made by the representative\r\nof Slovenia on behalf of the sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/53/L.18, and going\r\nalong with the will of many delegations to reach a\r\ncompromise text, my delegation will not insist on its\r\namendment, contained in document A/53/L.19.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): As we\r\nhave just heard, draft resolution A/53/L.19 has been\r\nwithdrawn from consideration.\r\nThe following countries have joined the list of\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/53/L.18: Belarus, Bulgaria, El Salvador, Greece,\r\nLuxembourg, Monaco, New Zealand and San Marino.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.18, as orally revised. Before giving the floor to the\r\nspeakers in explanation of vote before the vote, may I\r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are limited to\r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nI call on the representative of the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic on a point of order.\r\nMr. Abou-Hadid (Syrian Arab Republic)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): My delegation appeals to you,\r\nSir, as the President of the General Assembly, and in view\r\nof the fact that you are highly skilful politically and are a\r\nForeign Minister, to take into account the fact that the draft\r\nresolution before us for decision, which was officially\r\ncirculated to us only this morning, has political\r\nimplications, and delegations need instructions from their\r\ncapitals. I raise this question to appeal to you once again,\r\nSir, to postpone any action on this draft resolution during\r\nthis meeting so that we may refer it to our capitals and\r\nreceive instructions. This will enable us not to ignore our\r\nresponsibility for awaiting instructions from our capitals\r\nwith regard to voting on this draft resolution. As you know,\r\nSir, there were consultations until 3 p.m. today on\r\namendments presented this morning. There was an\r\namendment which is now before us. I request that in your\r\npolitical capacity you take this into consideration, and\r\nappeal to the sponsors to understand the importance of\r\npostponing any decision on the draft resolution.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic has requested\r\npostponement of a decision on the draft resolution. Before\r\ndeciding on this point, I call on the representative of\r\nSlovenia, who has asked for the floor.\r\nMr. Türk (Slovenia): Our delegation listened very\r\ncarefully to the statement by the representative of the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic. Like other sponsors, we are aware\r\nof the political importance and sensitivity of the content of\r\nthis draft resolution. On the other hand, we would recall\r\nthat it was circulated last week; it was available to all\r\ndelegations on Friday, 30 October following a period of\r\nextensive consultations in which all interested delegations\r\nhad the opportunity to participate.\r\nFurthermore, during the discussions this morning and\r\nthe informal consultations which have taken place, the very\r\nconstructive spirit which prevailed made it possible for the\r\nsponsors to agree with the author of the amendment to a\r\nformulation in paragraph 7, which is again a balanced and\r\nhelpful arrangement. Therefore, we would most\r\nrespectfully suggest that the sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution would very strongly prefer that action on it be\r\ntaken now.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I\r\nshould like to remind representatives that rule 71 of the\r\nrules of procedures of the General Assembly provides that\r\nduring the discussion of any matter a representative may\r\nrise to a point of order, and it shall be decided\r\nimmediately by the President in accordance with the rules\r\nof procedure. A representative may appeal against the\r\nruling of the President. The appeal shall be immediately\r\nput to the vote, and the President’s ruling shall stand\r\nunless overruled by a majority of the members present\r\nand voting. A representative rising to a point of order\r\nmay not speak on the substance of the matter under\r\ndiscussion.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): My delegation is fully\r\naware of the rules of procedure referred to, and it is in\r\nthis spirit that we take the floor to prepare the ground for\r\nyour ruling, Mr. President, because if the ground is not\r\nlevel the presidency may in the future be interpreted as\r\ndeterring discussion; while you have that authority to rule,\r\ndelegations — as per the norms and tradition of this\r\nHouse — reserve the right to speak, so that when you\r\nmake a ruling, Sir, you base it on views expressed from\r\nthe floor.\r\nWith regard to the proposal made by the\r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic, I wish to echo\r\nthe sentiments and views of the Slovenian delegation. I\r\nbelieve the amendment was circulated early enough to\r\nfacilitate and conclude consultations, and, since the\r\nsponsors of paragraph 7 have arrived at a consensus\r\ndecision, I humbly appeal to the Syrian delegation, in a\r\nspirit of fraternity, to afford us the latitude to take action\r\non this draft resolution. I do so especially since the onus\r\nwas on the Syrian delegation to take quick action, as soon\r\nas the draft resolution was circulated, to consult\r\nthoroughly with its capital. I am aware that it is a matter\r\nof delicacy, but at the same time consensus is always the\r\nsoul of success, and thus the Syrian delegation, my\r\ngreatest friends, should consider this of paramount\r\nimportance.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank\r\nthe representative of Swaziland for his statement, from\r\nwhich I infer the possibility of calling on the\r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic once again.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nMr. Abou-Hadid (Syrian Arab Republic)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): My delegation has not tried to\r\nplace any obstacles before the adoption of this draft\r\nresolution. The work of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) is commended by my delegation and my\r\ncountry and we appreciate the efforts made by the Agency\r\nand its Director General. I have listened attentively to the\r\nstatement made by the Ambassador of Slovenia on the\r\ncirculation of this draft resolution on Friday. We received\r\nit this morning, not on Friday. Once again we hope that the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly will always be\r\ntaken into consideration. You, Mr. President, are a\r\ndepositary and a guardian of the rules of procedure. We\r\nrespect your ruling. I also wish to extend my personal\r\ngratitude to the Ambassador of Swaziland.\r\nWe highly appreciate his appeal, and therefore we\r\nagree not to put this matter to a vote.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I am\r\ngrateful to the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic\r\nfor withdrawing the proposal he made on a point of order.\r\nWe shall now, therefore, continue our consideration of\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.18, as orally revised. I remind\r\nmembers that the time for them to speak in explanation of\r\nvote before the vote is now, and that explanations of vote\r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea finds it regrettable that the General\r\nAssembly is once again to vote on the same draft\r\nresolution, which is of no use at all for the settlement of the\r\nnuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.\r\nI shall now reiterate my delegation’s position on the\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nFirst, as my delegation has stated here time and again,\r\nthe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is not a question\r\nto be debated at the United Nations, but a question to be\r\nresolved between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States.\r\nThe United States is the party that brought nuclear\r\nweapons into South Korea and created “North Korea’s\r\nnuclear suspicion” in an attempt to isolate and stifle the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Agreed\r\nFramework between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States of October 1994 eloquently\r\nspeaks of the fact that the nuclear issue on the Korean\r\npeninsula is none other than a political and military issue\r\nto be settled by the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States.\r\nAs for implementation of the Agreed Framework, it\r\nis essential for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the\r\nKorean peninsula.\r\nWe have, from the first days of the adoption of the\r\nAgreed Framework, frozen all the relevant nuclear\r\nfacilities and put them under IAEA monitoring. We have\r\nalso allowed the IAEA regular and non-regular inspection\r\nactivities on the nuclear facilities which are not subject to\r\nthe freeze. Therefore, as long as the nuclear facilities are\r\nunder IAEA monitoring, preservation of information on\r\nour past nuclear activities is ensured.\r\nHowever, the United States has not properly\r\nimplemented any of its obligations under the Agreed\r\nFramework. The United States has not taken steps to lift\r\nsanctions, as an apparent effort to renounce its hostile\r\npolicy towards the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea. It has been nearly a year since the ground-\r\nbreaking ceremony for the construction of the light water\r\nreactors, but we do not know when the full construction\r\nwork will begin. Failure on the part of the United States\r\nto deliver heavy oil on schedule creates additional\r\ndifficulties for our economy.\r\nNow the United States says that it is unable to fulfil\r\nits obligations under the agreement because North Korea\r\nis building a secret underground structure for a nuclear\r\nfacility. This is one of the latest attempts on the part of\r\nthe United States to break the Agreed Framework. We\r\nhave clearly stated that we have constructed many\r\nunderground structures for civil use, and, if the United\r\nStates insists on clarifying this, we can show the one\r\nwhich the United States claims is a secret underground\r\nnuclear facility, on condition that when it is confirmed not\r\nto be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay\r\ncompensation for slandering and defaming my country.\r\nIn a word, the Agreed Framework is not a favour\r\ngranted by the United States to the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea. We have frozen our independent\r\nnational nuclear power industry on the premise that the\r\nUnited States would fulfil its obligations under the\r\nagreement. If the United States regards the Agreement as\r\na nuisance, it is free to break it. We are not going to beg\r\nthe United States not to break it. Once it is broken, we\r\nwill be free to develop our independent nuclear power\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nindustry with our own technology and resources, without\r\nrelying on the inconvenient technology of others who would\r\nnot readily share their technology with us.\r\nSecondly, there cannot be full compliance with the\r\nsafeguards agreement without implementation of the Agreed\r\nFramework between the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States. As the Director General of the\r\nIAEA said, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\naccepts the IAEA’s activities within the context of the\r\nAgreed Framework; those activities are inseparably related\r\nto the implementation of the Agreed Framework under the\r\nagreement.\r\nThe Agreed Framework is based not on trust, but on\r\nthe principle of simultaneous actions by both sides. The\r\nAgency’s activities in our country are correlated with the\r\nimplementation of the Agreed Framework and therefore\r\nshould be conducted in proportion to the implementation of\r\nthe Agreed Framework. The Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea does not have a unilateral obligation to allow the\r\nIAEA to conduct monitoring activities when the United\r\nStates is not fulfilling its obligations under the Agreed\r\nFramework. If the Agreed Framework is broken, the\r\nAgency’s activities will automatically come to an end.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to remind the Assembly\r\nthat the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea decided to\r\nwithdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) in March 1993, but suspended\r\nexecution of that decision on condition that the United\r\nStates implement the Agreed Framework.\r\nDespite all these facts, certain countries and IAEA\r\nofficials are trying to turn away from the essence of the\r\nissue by urging the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nto fully comply with the safeguards agreement. If they are\r\nreally concerned for the settlement of the nuclear issue on\r\nthe Korean peninsula and our compliance with the\r\nsafeguards agreement, they should not put pressure on the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, but should urge\r\nthe United States, the originator of the issue, to implement\r\nthe Agreed Framework. To urge the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea to fully comply with the safeguards\r\nagreement, without a single word about the failure of the\r\nUnited States to implement its obligations under the Agreed\r\nFramework, is nothing but the cowardly act of hypocrites\r\nbullying the weak and siding with the strong, which is not\r\nconvincing to people with reason and a sense of justice.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation will vote against the\r\ndraft resolution because it will hinder rather than help the\r\nsettlement of the issue. Its objective is to put pressure on\r\nus, thereby endangering the fate of the Agreed\r\nFramework. It will also damage the credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the only speaker in explanation of vote before\r\nthe vote.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.18, as orally revised. A recorded vote\r\nhas been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Argentina, Armenia, Australia,\r\nAustria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus,\r\nBelgium, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria,\r\nBurkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde,\r\nChad, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nCuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Djibouti,\r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador,\r\nEstonia, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Georgia,\r\nGermany, Ghana, Greece, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nGuyana, Hungary, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic\r\nof), Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan,\r\nKazakhstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico,\r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Monaco,\r\nMongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar,\r\nNamibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua,\r\nNiger, Norway, Oman, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines,\r\nPoland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic\r\nof Moldova, Romania, San Marino, Saudi Arabia,\r\nSenegal, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South\r\nAfrica, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname,\r\nSwaziland, Sweden, Thailand, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey,\r\nUkraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic\r\nof Tanzania, United States of America, Uruguay,\r\nVanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen\r\nAgainst:\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nAbstaining:\r\nBhutan, Botswana, China, India, Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, Pakistan, Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic, Viet Nam\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.18, as orally revised, was\r\nadopted by 113 votes to 1, with 8 abstentions (resolution\r\n53/21).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of Bolivia, Botswana,\r\nJordan and the Russian Federation advised the\r\nSecretariat that they had intended to vote in favour.]\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I shall\r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to speak in\r\nexplanation of vote on the resolution just adopted.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations\r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Manickam (India): India, a founder member of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), attaches\r\nthe highest importance and value to the objectives of the\r\nAgency. Since this resolution pertains to the activities of\r\nthe IAEA, we might have been able to go along with it. We\r\ndid not and could not do so because we have considerable\r\ndifficulty with the third and twelfth preambular paragraphs.\r\nThe language in the third preambular paragraph of\r\ndocument A/53/L.18 appears to link adherence to the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\r\nthe freedom to develop, research, produce and use nuclear\r\nenergy for peaceful purposes. The statute of the IAEA,\r\nwhich must guide all our deliberations on the Agency’s\r\nactivities, calls on the Agency to accelerate and enlarge the\r\ncontribution of atomic energy to peace, health and\r\nprosperity throughout the world. Further, the statute stresses\r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of all its members.\r\nThe purpose of those provisions in the statute of the IAEA\r\nis obviously to encourage the unfettered access of member\r\nStates to the peaceful use of atomic energy, without any\r\ndiscrimination whatsoever, albeit with appropriate\r\nsafeguards.\r\nThe IAEA’s statute predates the NPT and, besides, the\r\nAgency has not been designated as a secretariat of the NPT.\r\nThe Agency merely carries out safeguards of different\r\nmember States in accordance with their agreements, and the\r\nconcept of safeguards itself predates the NPT. The NPT is\r\nnot an equitable Treaty. Furthermore, the provisions of\r\narticle VI of the NPT have not been fulfilled by the\r\nnuclear-weapon States. Therefore, the NPT should not be\r\nused for discriminating between members of the IAEA.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nBy implying that adherence to the NPT, on which\r\nmy Government’s views are well known, alone would\r\ngive access to the peaceful uses of atomic energy, the\r\nresolution deviates, and in fact derogates from, the\r\nobjectives enshrined in the Statute of the IAEA.\r\nWe are concerned about how the IAEA’s basic\r\nobjectives are being distorted with regard both to the NPT\r\nand, now, to the taking up of matters like the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which\r\nare not of any relevance to the Statute of the Agency. In\r\nmeetings of both the Board of Governors and of the\r\nGeneral Conference of the IAEA, we have repeatedly\r\nstressed that the IAEA is not the appropriate forum for a\r\ndebate on nuclear testing. The place for that might be\r\nhere, in the First Committee, in the Conference on\r\nDisarmament in Geneva or in the still embryonic CTBT\r\nOrganization in Vienna.\r\nWe have pointed out how countries that had spoken\r\nagainst the inclusion of an agenda item on nuclear testing\r\nin 1995 backtracked three years later when it came to the\r\ndebate on nuclear testing by India and Pakistan. The\r\nresolution in 1995 was passed without naming countries,\r\nand, even though those countries carried out further\r\nnuclear tests in 1996, no criticism was made in the\r\ndiscussions at the Agency. That was in contrast to the\r\naction pushed through in the General Conference this\r\nyear.\r\nParagraph B.1 of article III of the Statute of the\r\nIAEA calls for “furthering the establishment of\r\nsafeguarded worldwide disarmament” — not non-\r\nproliferation, as championed by the sponsors of the\r\nresolution on nuclear testing. We have also emphasized\r\nthat the IAEA, perhaps among the most scientifically\r\noriented organizations in the United Nations system, was\r\nin danger of diluting its scientific and technical character\r\nand becoming a shadow political forum for debate at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe have also witnessed the unprecedented situation\r\nat the General Conference of the IAEA in September this\r\nyear, when 21 of the sponsors abstained when voting on\r\nthe corresponding resolution itself, and the number of\r\nabstentions almost equalled the votes in favour. It is\r\nobvious that the manner and modalities used to push\r\nthrough this resolution left little confidence in the minds\r\nof member States, including even many of the sponsors,\r\nas reflected in the polling.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nWe were, therefore, constrained to abstain on the\r\nwhole draft resolution.\r\nMr. Pang Sen (China) (interpretation from Chinese):\r\nThe delegation of China would like to express its\r\nappreciation to the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) for the great deal of work it has done in the past\r\nyear to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to\r\nsafeguard, monitor and prevent the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nThe delegation of China is generally satisfied with the\r\nreport of the IAEA, and therefore approved of most of the\r\ncontent of the draft resolution on the report, in document\r\nA/53/L.18. At the same time, the delegation of China has\r\nreservations with regard to the formulation of related issues\r\nin the resolution. China has always been in favour of\r\nseeking an appropriate solution to related issues through\r\nconsultation and dialogue. We believe that the application\r\nof pressure or confrontation are not conducive to resolving\r\nissues. For those reasons, the delegation of China abstained\r\nin the vote on the resolution that has just been adopted on\r\nthe report of the IAEA.\r\nMs. Janjua (Pakistan): Despite the considerable\r\nimportance we attach to the objectives and role of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the delegation\r\nof Pakistan was constrained to abstain on the vote in the\r\ndraft resolution in document A/53/L.18. We were obliged\r\nto do so because of the inclusion of the twelfth preambular\r\nparagraph on nuclear testing. At the General Conference of\r\nthe IAEA, Pakistan opposed the submission and adoption\r\nof resolution GC/(42)/RES/19 on nuclear testing. We\r\nbelieved that consideration of that issue was beyond the\r\ncompetence of the IAEA. Moreover, the draft resolution\r\nwas discriminatory in its approach. Our position in the\r\nIAEA opposing the issue of nuclear testing was consistent\r\nwith the position which Pakistan took in 1995, when a\r\nsimilar move was made against the nuclear tests conducted\r\nthat year by two friendly nuclear-weapon States.\r\nIt is ironic that this year the nuclear sponsors of the\r\ndraft resolution and their military allies felt obliged to\r\nabstain on their own draft resolution because of the\r\ninclusion of a provision calling for nuclear disarmament.\r\nThe discriminatory approach adopted in the IAEA General\r\nConference has been compounded by the insertion of a\r\nseparate preambular paragraph referring to resolution\r\nGC(42)/RES.19. We recall that at the 1995 General\r\nAssembly session there was no such mention of the\r\nresolution adopted at the IAEA Conference that year\r\nregarding nuclear testing. Such discrimination is\r\nunacceptable. We would therefore have voted against this\r\nparagraph if it had been put to the vote.\r\nWe also have reservations on the third preambular\r\nparagraph and certain reservations on paragraph 9\r\nregarding the pre-emptive assertion of a role for the\r\nAgency in combating illicit trafficking in nuclear\r\nmaterials. This matter, we believe, is under consideration\r\nin the Sixth Committee, and its outcome should not be\r\nprejudged.\r\nMr. Abou-Hadid (Syrian Arab Republic)\r\n(interpretation from Arabic): My delegation abstained\r\nfrom voting on the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/53/L.18, but not because of the work of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its\r\nactivities. In Syria, we highly appreciate the work of the\r\nAgency and its important role, under the leadership of its\r\nDirector General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei; that role in\r\nextending assistance to States in the field of peaceful uses\r\nof energy in the course of last year was praiseworthy and\r\ncommendable.\r\nWe abstained on the draft resolution because Israel\r\nhas not acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). Consequently, it has not been\r\npossible to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the\r\nMiddle East, despite the efforts of the IAEA and its\r\nprevious Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, as well as of\r\nthe current Director General, to whom we express our\r\nunceasing readiness to cooperate with him and the\r\nAgency to bring about the success of its work.\r\nWe are quite hopeful that these efforts in the course\r\nof next year will be wider and broader and that they will\r\nbe crowned with tangible results that correspond with the\r\naspirations of the States of the region to create a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone.\r\nThe fact that only Israel in the Middle East has not\r\nacceded to the NPT, in addition to the fact that it has not\r\ndeclared its intention to accede to the Treaty and subject\r\nall its nuclear facilities to the comprehensive safeguards\r\nregime of the IAEA, constitutes a danger to the region\r\nand the world. Israel’s stance threatens international peace\r\nand security.\r\nWe hope that the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity and the IAEA will succeed in urging Israel to\r\naccede to the Treaty so that, like other regions in the\r\nworld, the Middle East will be free of nuclear weapons,\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nthereby helping to achieve stability, security and peace in\r\nthe region and in the world.\r\nWith regard to the fourteenth preambular paragraph of\r\nthe draft resolution on amending article VI of the statute of\r\nthe Agency, my delegation is of the view that the efforts\r\nmade by the Chairman of the Board of Governors to find\r\na formula to amend article VI can provide a basis for\r\ndiscussion and exchange of views.\r\nHowever, discussing the amendment of article VI in\r\nparallel with the composition of regional groups and within\r\nthe proposals package of the Chairman will only hamper\r\nsettlement of a subject that has been pending for more than\r\ntwo decades. It is no secret that Africa, the Middle East and\r\nSouth Asia look forward to finding a formula that achieves\r\ntheir equitable representation in the Agency, given the\r\nincreasing number of States that have joined the Agency.\r\nWith regard to the composition of regional groups, this\r\nis a separate item that must be treated in accordance with\r\nthe General Conference resolution, GC(39)/RES.22, which\r\nopenly indicates that the primary responsibility regarding\r\nthe composition of regional groups lies with the regions\r\nthemselves. Therefore, it is not possible to impose a\r\nmember on a specific region without the prior consent of\r\nthe States of that region. The States of the Middle East and\r\nSouth Asia reject and continue to reject Israel’s joining\r\nthem. This is for objective reasons that cannot be denied —\r\nits occupation of Arab territories of some of the States of\r\nthe region whose populations it evacuates and against\r\nwhom it exercises violence. Moreover, Israel engages in the\r\ndestruction of homes of Palestinians to build Israeli\r\nsettlements. It also rejects any international initiatives to\r\nrevive the peace negotiations on the principles on which\r\nthese negotiations are based.\r\nGiven this situation, no cooperation can be undertaken\r\nby the members of any regional group with a view to\r\nachieving their objectives, and to securing for them\r\nmaximum benefit. We believe that the discrimination which\r\nIsrael alleges is practised against it is in fact discrimination\r\nexperienced by the States of Africa, the Middle East and\r\nSouth Asia which holds the right of these States hostage to\r\nthe illegal aspirations of one State.\r\nWe call upon the international community, particularly\r\nthe IAEA, to compel Israel to demonstrate a full and\r\nunconditional respect for the work of the Agency and for\r\nthe will of the international community by acceding to the\r\nNPT and by subjecting all its nuclear activities and facilities\r\nto the comprehensive safeguards regime of the IAEA.\r\nMr. Ziaran (Islamic Republic of Iran): My\r\ndelegation voted in favour of draft resolution A/53/L.18,\r\nwhich has just been adopted. However, I wish to place on\r\nrecord the following explanation of our vote.\r\nRegarding the provisions of preambular paragraph\r\n14, we strongly hold that any decision on geographical\r\ngroupings in the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) is, and should remain, the prerogative of the\r\nmembers of the regional groups.\r\nWith regard to the implementation of the Model\r\nAdditional Protocol relating to safeguards, to which\r\nreference is made in paragraph 3, my delegation believes\r\nfirmly that the protocol should be applied equally and in\r\na non-discriminatory manner to nuclear facilities and\r\nactivities of all States members of the Agency, in\r\nparticular to those of nuclear-weapon States.\r\nMr. Dausá Céspedes (Cuba) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The delegation of Cuba voted in favour of draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.18 because we feel that the substance\r\nof the text focuses on the work of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency, an agency that in our view\r\nmakes an important contribution to developing countries\r\nin the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. As\r\nwe said in our earlier statement, however, the resolution\r\nthis year again includes elements that are extraneous to\r\nthis agenda item. The delegation of Cuba wishes therefore\r\nto put on record that had separate votes been taken on\r\ncertain paragraphs we would have abstained in accordance\r\nwith my country’s position on the resolutions to which\r\nthose paragraphs make reference.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote on this item.\r\nBefore calling on the first delegation that has asked\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply, I wish to remind\r\nmembers that, in accordance with decision 34/401,\r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply shall be\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five\r\nminutes for the second, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): Several countries have referred to the\r\nnuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, urging my country\r\nto fully comply with the safeguards agreement with the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). I do not\r\nthink, however, that there is any need to respond to them,\r\nas I clearly stated the position of my delegation before the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nvote. But I am going to exercise my right of reply to\r\nrespond to South Korea and to Japan only, because it is\r\nunbecoming of them to speak of the nuclear issue on the\r\nKorean peninsula.\r\nAs for the South Korean authorities, they are traitors\r\nto the nation, who have brought foreign nuclear weapons\r\ninto the territory of the Korean nation. It is preposterous\r\nthat the South Korean authorities should take issue with us,\r\nas if they were concerned about the nuclear issue on the\r\nKorean peninsula. They are begging the United States for\r\na nuclear umbrella, which is one of the main obstacles to\r\nthe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The nuclear\r\nissue on the Korean peninsula is not a technical matter; it\r\nis a grave military and political one. That is why the South\r\nKorean authorities have no voice in the nuclear issue, as\r\nthey have no prerogative relating to military and political\r\nmatters.\r\nThe South Korean authorities are attempting to slander\r\nus, with the ulterior motive of isolating my country from\r\nthe international community. They have no intention of\r\nsettling the nuclear issue. The more they make a fuss and\r\nslander us, the more they reveal the meanness and vulgarity\r\nthat are peculiar to traitors depending on foreign forces.\r\nAs for Japan, it consistently and arrogantly pursues the\r\npolicy of nuclear armament. Japan is operating the largest\r\nreprocessing factory in the world. Successive Japanese\r\nGovernment ministers have claimed that it is lawful for\r\nJapan to possess nuclear weapons. In particular, we cannot\r\noverlook the fact that, with regard to the legality of the use\r\nof nuclear weapons, Japan submitted to the International\r\nCourt of Justice the view that the use of nuclear weapons\r\nwas not against international law. All this shows that Japan\r\nhas no interest in the fair settlement of the nuclear issue on\r\nthe Korean peninsula. Nor is it concerned about the peace\r\nand security of the region, as it often claims; rather, it is\r\ndesperately trying to find excuses for its nuclear armament.\r\nJapan’s military ambition is a real threat to peace and\r\nsecurity in the North-East Asian region. We cannot think\r\nthat Japan aspires to a nuclear-free world and to peace,\r\neven though it suffered nuclear bombing in the past and\r\ntalks a lot about opposing nuclear weapons. Japan should\r\nknow that in order to earn the trust of neighbouring\r\ncountries it must shed its arrogance and craftiness and show\r\nintegrity and sincerity.\r\nMr. Cho (Republic of Korea): We listened very\r\ncarefully and with great attention to the statement just made\r\nby our colleague from North Korea. Frankly, we are very\r\ndisappointed in his statement; particularly, that part of it\r\naddressed to my delegation was quite disturbing. It was\r\ndisturbing because it totally lacked that minimum of\r\ncourtesy and civility of language that are warranted in\r\nserious debate on so important an issue as the report of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We\r\ntotally reject it.\r\nIf we were to go into detail and rebut him point by\r\npoint, I imagine it would take several hours. I believe that\r\nis not the wish of this body, so I will refrain from\r\nreciprocating the uncivil language that was used by our\r\ncolleague from the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea, language that is totally unacceptable to our\r\ndelegation.\r\nSecondly, we are quite disappointed, because, despite\r\ngood intentions on the part of our delegation to find a\r\nnew element in the intervention of the representative of\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, we could not\r\ndetect any indications from him that the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea would heed the almost\r\nconsensual appeal of the international community for that\r\ncountry to cooperate with the IAEA for full\r\nimplementation of the Agency’s safeguards agreement.\r\nDuring the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s\r\nstatement in explanation of vote, its representative argued\r\nthat his country was under no legal obligation to\r\nimplement the safeguards agreement, and linked all these\r\nobligations to the Agreed Framework. But this is also\r\nunacceptable to us; we made that very clear in our\r\nstatement during the debate on the IAEA report, as did\r\nmany other representatives. There is no doubt that, as a\r\nparty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT), the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea is under a legal obligation to implement the IAEA\r\nsafeguards agreement. This obligation cannot be replaced\r\nby the Agreed Framework.\r\nOf course, we support the full implementation of the\r\nAgreed Framework, because implementation is very\r\nimportant to peace and security on the Korean peninsula.\r\nBut the Agreed Framework itself does not exonerate the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea from its legal\r\nobligations under the NPT and the safeguards agreement.\r\nThe Agreed Framework is the arrangement which\r\ncomplements and reinforces the legal obligation which the\r\nNorth Koreans voluntarily undertook when they joined the\r\nNPT and when they signed the IAEA safeguards\r\nagreement.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 51st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 2 November 1998\r\nI do not think I have to cite the resolutions which have\r\nalready been adopted in many international forums. We\r\nhave just adopted another resolution in the name of the\r\nUnited Nations calling for full cooperation by the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea in the\r\nimplementation of its safeguards agreement and expressing\r\ndeep concerns over the continuing non-compliance by the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nHaving said that, we wish to appeal to our colleague\r\nfrom the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that it\r\nbecome more reasonable and forthcoming in its technical\r\ndiscussions and interactions with the IAEA for the full\r\nimplementation of the safeguards agreement, which remains\r\nin force and legally binding upon it.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea): It is quite funny and ridiculous that traitors are\r\nteaching about patriotism. The South Koreans are really\r\ntraitors who brought in nuclear weapons and are begging\r\nfor a foreign nuclear umbrella. This means that they intend\r\nto invite a foreign nuclear attack on their own compatriots.\r\nThey are also pursuing the objective of isolating our\r\ncountry from the international community. What the\r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea has just said shows\r\ntheir ulterior intention of isolating my country from the\r\ninternational community. They do not even know what is\r\nhappening politically and militarily on the Korean\r\npeninsula. They are now staging large-scale combined\r\nmilitary exercises with the United States against us. I once\r\nagain declare that they are traitors of the nation. It is very\r\nimportant for the South Koreans to reflect deeply if they\r\ncalculate that they can benefit from aggravating the tension\r\non the Korean peninsula by hindering the settlement of the\r\nnuclear issue; otherwise, they will surely repent their absurd\r\nand rash acts.\r\nMr. Cho (Republic of Korea): We listened again\r\nwith great disappointment to the intervention just made by\r\nour colleague from North Korea. I do not feel I should\r\ntake precious time just to refute what he has said, because\r\nhe only repeated language lacking courtesy and civility.\r\nI simply reject it again for the sake of the record. But I\r\ndid detect one new element — the allegation that the\r\nRepublic of Korea is trying to isolate North Korea. That\r\nis incorrect, and I wish to set the record straight on this\r\npoint. As on numerous occasions, particularly after the\r\nnew Administration was established in the Republic of\r\nKorea, we have been very actively pursuing a\r\ncomprehensive engagement policy vis-à-vis North Korea.\r\nWe do not want to engage in the confrontational setting\r\nwhich originates from the old eras. We are trying to open\r\na new age of reconciliation and cooperation on the\r\nKorean peninsula. The engagement policy of my new\r\nGovernment, which is called the Sunshine Policy, rejects\r\nthe isolation of North Korea, contrary to the ghost my\r\nKorean colleague is now perceiving. We want to be\r\ncooperative and to bring North Korea into the\r\ninternational community for the good, well-being,\r\nprosperity and, indeed, peace, of the Korean peninsula.\r\nHaving said that, I would once again appeal to our\r\nNorth Korean colleagues to understand our genuine\r\nintention. We are trying to engage North Korea to open\r\nup a new era of genuine peace, reconciliation and\r\ncooperation on the Korean peninsula.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n14?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
