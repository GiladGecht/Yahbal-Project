(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mungra\r\n(Suriname), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nNatural disasters in the Central American States\r\nThe Acting President: Before turning to the item on\r\nour agenda this morning, may I, on behalf of the members\r\nof the Assembly and on my own behalf, extend to the\r\nGovernments and the peoples of the Central American\r\ncountries recently struck by a disastrous hurricane our\r\ndeepest sympathy for the tragic loss of life and extensive\r\nmaterial damage.\r\nMay I also express the hope that the international\r\ncommunity will demonstrate its solidarity by responding\r\npromptly and generously to any request from those\r\ncountries for assistance in their present plight.\r\nAgenda item 168\r\nDialogue among civilizations\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.23/Rev.1)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.23/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran): The founders\r\nof our Organization enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations the common aspirations of the whole of humanity\r\nand, indeed, their determination to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, which twice in their\r\nlifetime had brought untold sorrow to mankind. They\r\nsought to do so by practising tolerance and living together\r\nin peace with one another as good neighbours, by\r\npromoting justice and respect for the rule of law and by\r\nreaffirming their faith in fundamental human rights, in the\r\ndignity and worth of the human person and in the equal\r\nrights of men and women and of nations large and small.\r\nAs we the people of the United Nations look back\r\nand take stock of half a century of the Charter’s\r\nexistence, together with achievements — historic as they\r\nare — including the very establishment of this\r\nOrganization, we see dark episodes of bigotry, exclusion,\r\nconfrontation and bloodshed. With their extremely high\r\ntoll of human lives and on the human spirit, such\r\nepisodes have occurred in the era of the United Nations\r\nCharter, following two atrocious world wars which gave\r\nrise to a global commitment to arrest that trend. The last\r\ndecade of the twentieth century has had more than its\r\nshare of genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against\r\nhumanity, challenging the very ideals of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nBut I submit to the Assembly that these are\r\naberrations, not the norm. Indeed, the last decades of this\r\nmillennium since the advent of the United Nations have\r\nbeen characterized by a universal desire to promote peace,\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\ntolerance and understanding and ensure social, economic\r\nand political development through international cooperation\r\nand solidarity. This in itself is an achievement of\r\nunparalleled proportions, as if the horror of all the wars of\r\nthe past provided the background for the world community\r\nto embrace those Charter principles.\r\nCertainly, such progress has not come easily, since old\r\nhabits fade only after resistance and friction. It should thus\r\ncome as no surprise that today, when the international\r\ncommunity has a real and unique opportunity to break away\r\nfrom cold-war habits of domination and exclusion, ideas\r\nand theories are being put forward to institutionalize and\r\neven to sanctify and thus perpetuate the mentality\r\nassociated with rivalries and conflicts of the past. They do\r\nso by elevating the confrontation between rival political and\r\neconomic interests to the level of the irreconcilability of\r\ncivilizations and of their inevitable clash.\r\nIt is evident that on the eve of the new millennium the\r\nworld cannot afford to begin a new chapter in its life with\r\nsuch dangerous ideas, which give rise to intolerance and\r\nignore the ever-growing web of interaction among nations\r\nin an increasingly interdependent world.\r\nThe revolution in communications, which has\r\ntransformed the very concept of distance, provides us with\r\na historic opportunity to enter the next century with a\r\ncommon resolve to minimize misunderstandings and\r\nmisperceptions, utilizing the strengths of human diversity to\r\nface common challenges and advance common interests.\r\nPresident Khatami’s initiative to promote and facilitate\r\ndialogue among civilizations promises to provide a suitable\r\nframework for expanding the horizons for such constructive\r\nand enriching interaction among peoples of various origins\r\nand persuasions. Central to this framework is the premise\r\nthat the diversity of humankind is and has always been a\r\nsource of strength and not a reason for division. This would\r\nallow the process to encompass all nations and peoples\r\nregardless of their race, colour, creed or national origin.\r\nThe international community has indicated its willingness\r\nto embrace this idea as it hopes to provide a fresh approach\r\nto a better tomorrow for humanity.\r\nViolence is said to be the ultimate manifestation of\r\ninarticulateness. Dialogue among civilizations is thus a call\r\nstemming from the collective wisdom of man to avoid\r\nviolence, in its broadest sense, through better articulation of\r\ndiffering ideas, visions and aspirations. The nature of such\r\na dialogue is intellectual and cultural in essence. It\r\npostulates that the gift of diversity among people ought to\r\nbe recognized and explored through interaction and\r\ncommunication. While managing the diversity among\r\nnations is likely to remain among the most challenging\r\ntasks confronting the international community, dialogue\r\nand interaction are indispensable for any accomplishment\r\nin this respect.\r\nGreat civilizations throughout human history have\r\nflourished through a collective process of endeavour and\r\ninteraction of people and nations with diverse cultures and\r\norientations. Various civilizations in the span of history\r\nand geography have contributed, in one way or another,\r\nto the progressive development of human society as a\r\nwhole. They have learned from each other, have affected\r\nand influenced each other and at times have competed\r\nwith each other. A close reading of human history would\r\nindicate that, notwithstanding formidable obstacles to\r\nconstructive interaction among nations imposed by\r\nepisodes and manifestations of intolerance and war,\r\ncivilizations have always managed to benefit and thrive\r\nthrough communication and mutual enrichment, while\r\npreserving their individual identities. Thus, the\r\nachievements of different civilizations, constitute the\r\ncollective heritage of mankind. By the same token, the\r\nbenefits of interaction among civilizations have and will\r\ncontinue to be extended to all.\r\nGiven the fundamental role of culture in shaping\r\npolitical and economic structures, the promotion of\r\ndialogue among various cultures, on the basis of tolerance\r\nand respect for diversity, would result in the reduction of\r\ntensions and contribute to international peace and security.\r\nDialogue by itself would not guarantee the eradication of\r\nthe evils of war and bigotry. But it does provide a\r\nreasonable and sound paradigm to approach the global\r\nproblems likely to confront us in the twenty-first century.\r\nIt is thus imperative that each and every member of\r\nthe international community — Governments, the United\r\nNations system, international and non-governmental\r\norganizations — take part in the process of promoting and\r\nfacilitating dialogue among civilizations. This will require\r\nfirst and foremost the active engagement and participation\r\nof scholars, philosophers, intellectuals, artists and\r\nhistorians, among others. They are indeed the proper\r\nagents and immediate beneficiaries of dialogue and\r\nexchange, and they are undoubtedly cognizant and\r\nconvinced of its merits. A cursory search on the Internet\r\nreveals a multitude of primarily non-governmental\r\norganizations in practically every country that have a\r\nwealth of experience in one or another aspect of inter-\r\ncivilizational dialogue and that aim to foster peace and\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nunderstanding. Collective thinking and interactive\r\nreinforcement would pave the way towards common goals\r\nof peace, security, freedom, tolerance and justice.\r\nAs I indicated earlier, mutually beneficial interactions\r\namong civilizations have always existed and been carried\r\nthrough by visionary men and women despite all odds. The\r\nUnited Nations itself was built around this notion to bridge\r\nthe divide between nations united under the Charter and to\r\npromote peace and understanding through an inclusive\r\nprocess of dialogue and interaction. The significance of our\r\nexercise today, in this Assembly, is to confirm at the\r\npolitical level the universal recognition and endorsement of\r\nthe virtues, the wisdom and, indeed, the inescapable\r\nimperative of dialogue among civilizations for the growth\r\nof human life. Our aggregate support for the notion of\r\ndialogue among civilizations will help in rendering it all the\r\nmore forceful a reality.\r\nThe proposal of President Khatami to designate the\r\nyear 2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations seeks to express the collective resolve of the\r\ninternational community to begin the new millennium with\r\na fresh approach to global interactions and a determination\r\nto build a better tomorrow for future generations based on\r\na new paradigm of understanding and mutual respect. His\r\nvision was shared by many other world leaders, including\r\nour Secretary-General, who have also spoken of the need\r\nfor greater understanding among nations, cultures and\r\ncivilizations. Judging from the statements made in this Hall,\r\nthe timing for the adoption of the proposal is impeccable.\r\nThis proposal has also found support in other\r\ninternational forums. It may be recalled that the Tehran\r\nDeclaration of the Eighth Islamic Summit Conference\r\nemphasized\r\n“the imperative of positive interaction, dialogue and\r\nunderstanding among cultures and religions; and\r\n[rejected] the theories of clash and conflict which\r\nbreed mistrust and diminish the grounds for peaceful\r\ninteraction among nations”. (A/53/72, annex II, p. 34)\r\nFurthermore, the Final Document of the twelfth\r\nsummit of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Durban,\r\nSouth Africa, announced that\r\n“the Heads of State or Government expressed their\r\nconcern at attempts to suggest divisions between\r\ncultures and civilizations ... and expressed their\r\nresolve to facilitate and promote enhanced dialogue\r\nbetween cultures and civilizations at the turn of the\r\nmillennium.” (chap. I, para. 43)\r\nThe time has now come for the General Assembly,\r\nas the sole universal body encompassing representatives\r\nof nearly every nation on earth, to designate the year\r\n2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. It is thus a great honour and privilege to\r\nintroduce the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/53/L.23/Rev.1, which seeks to take the first step in this\r\nregard and lay the foundation for institutionalizing,\r\npromoting and facilitating dialogue among civilizations.\r\nI do so on behalf of the sponsors of this draft resolution,\r\nnamely, according to the list that I have, Afghanistan,\r\nArmenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh,\r\nBelgium, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Cyprus, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Korea, Denmark, Egypt, Fiji, Germany,\r\nGreece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, Lebanon,\r\nLesotho, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Luxembourg,\r\nMalaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan,\r\nQatar, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Senegal,\r\nSpain, the Sudan, Sweden, the Syrian Arab Republic,\r\nTajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, Yemen and my own\r\ncountry.\r\nThe draft resolution, in addition to designating the\r\nyear 2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among\r\nCivilizations, reaffirms the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter, recognizes the diverse civilizational achievements\r\nof mankind, emphasizes the importance of tolerance, and\r\ninvites Governments, the United Nations system,\r\nincluding the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization, and other international and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to initiate policies aimed at\r\nfacilitating dialogue and exchange and to adopt\r\nappropriate programmes, such as public awareness\r\ncampaigns, seminars and conferences to promote dialogue\r\namong civilizations.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran and other sponsors of\r\nthis draft resolution are confident that all Member States\r\nhave given this concept and the draft resolution due\r\nconsideration and are in a position to lend their\r\nunanimous support, taking a resolute and historic first\r\nstep towards the institutionalization of dialogue, providing\r\nfuture generations with a sound and firm point of\r\ndeparture to face the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nWith this, we are solemnly declaring that it is the\r\nhope and indeed the determination of the multitude of\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\ncultures and civilizations which today form the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations that the third millennium will be one of\r\ndialogue and not of clash, one of articulation and not of\r\nviolence.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French): We\r\nlive in a world that is both unique and diverse, and that is\r\nrich in its cultural and civilizational diversity. The\r\nglobalization of what is at stake and of the challenges that\r\nface mankind as the century draws to a close makes it more\r\nvital than ever before to build a unified world: a world of\r\ndialogue, and not of confrontation.\r\nDecades ago, the first President of independent\r\nSenegal, the poet and academician Léopold Sédar Senghor,\r\nput forward the concept of a “civilization of the universal”\r\nthat would be a place for give and take, where every\r\npeople, every nation, every country, every region, every\r\nculture would give to others the best of its own and in\r\nreturn receive from others the best of what they have to\r\nshare. It would be a place where civilizations were open to\r\ninfluences from other civilizations. It would be crucible of\r\nenriching contributions from other civilizations, yielding a\r\npan-human civilization. This notion of a civilization of the\r\nuniversal and of brotherhood among cultures, races and\r\ntraditions is more timely than ever.\r\nOn the eve of the third millennium, the globalization\r\nof the economy, of culture and of thought and increasing\r\ninterdependence among nations oblige us to form a new\r\nvision of international relations that excludes confrontation,\r\nracial hatred and xenophobia. The wealth of the world is its\r\ndiversity. But its future strength remains subject to its\r\nability to cultivate a spirit of peace, tolerance, dialogue and\r\nsolidarity among its various components.\r\nMy delegation has joined in sponsoring draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.23/Rev.1, on the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, precisely because of this\r\nconcept of relationships among the Earth’s nations and\r\nindividuals, and in conformity with our traditional openness\r\nand respect for the traditions and customs of others.\r\nDialogue, with a patient determination to reach dynamic\r\ncompromise, has always been a constant of Senegal’s\r\nforeign policy.\r\nThe only solution for the international community is\r\nnegotiation and the harmonization of concepts and ideas —\r\nin brief, dialogue among cultures, civilizations and\r\nreligions. The world needs a culture based on what we have\r\nin common and on pan-humanism. This need is all the\r\nmore critical for the future development of the world\r\nbecause of the lessons we have learned from the history\r\nof society and of humanity. How many wars could have\r\nbeen avoided had a spirit of understanding, dialogue,\r\ntolerance and forgiveness had prevailed? That is true of\r\npast conflicts, just as it is true of the armed confrontations\r\nof the present day.\r\nThere is no intermediate option between the two\r\nalternatives: dialogue among civilizations on the one hand\r\nand confrontation among civilizations on the other.\r\nDialogue among civilizations is possible and desirable, for\r\nit is neither possible nor desirable to impose uniformity\r\non cultures and civilizations. The United Nations, where\r\nevery day finds men and women from all cultures and\r\ncivilizations side by side, remains the ideal framework for\r\npromoting, strengthening and consolidating the right to be\r\ndifferent, and above all the culture of dialogue — and\r\ndialogue among cultures and civilizations.\r\nBy designating the year 2001 as the United Nations\r\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations, our universal\r\nOrganization would make a major contribution to our\r\ncommon struggle for peace, development and solidarity.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation takes this opportunity\r\nto congratulate the Islamic Republic of Iran on its\r\nwelcome initiative to bring this agenda item before the\r\nGeneral Assembly for discussion.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I would like to start by\r\nthanking the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nfor its initiative in requesting the inscription of this\r\nimportant item on dialogue among civilizations on the\r\nagenda of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly,\r\nand for the preparation of the draft resolution on this\r\nissue which is before us today.\r\nThe importance of our discussion today is not only\r\ndue to the fact that the subject matter is an extremely\r\nimportant one that was referred to by many leaders during\r\nthe general debate of the fifty-third session, but also\r\nbecause its discussion in the General Assembly during\r\nthis session, and at this time in particular, reflects a\r\ndetermined will to enter the new millennium with a new\r\ncommon approach based on common objectives and\r\ncommon understandings that are not divided by\r\nintellectual, cultural and religious ideologies and beliefs.\r\nThis determined will is based on the strong foundation of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, which in Article 1, paragraph\r\n3, states among the purposes of the United Nations,\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\n“To achieve international cooperation in solving\r\ninternational problems of an economic, social, cultural,\r\nor humanitarian character, and in promoting and\r\nencouraging respect for human rights and for\r\nfundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to\r\nrace, sex, language, or religion.”\r\nIt is also based on article 3 of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, which says,\r\n“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and\r\nsecurity of person.”\r\nImmediately after the end of the cold war in the late\r\n1980s, some spoke of “the clash of civilizations”. Debate\r\nabout this theory continues. It is a debate on humanity and\r\nthe course it will chart for itself — whether conflict and\r\nconflagration or coexistence and peace. We, the\r\nrepresentatives of the international community here\r\nassembled in the United Nations, cannot and should not, at\r\nthis historical juncture, ignore such a dangerous argument\r\nand destructive theory that runs counter to the common\r\nwork and collective obligations we agreed upon for\r\ninternational life. We, the children of the twentieth century,\r\nmust deal with this theory and respond to it clearly.\r\nIn our opinion, we must go into the next millennium\r\nfully confident that we are one community based on\r\npluralism — intellectual, religious and cultural pluralism\r\nand diversity. We must reaffirm that this diversity does not\r\nprejudice the unity of the international community. Rather,\r\nit strengthens that unity, making the international\r\ncommunity a dynamic whole based on healthy competition,\r\npositive coexistence and a common appreciation for the\r\nachievements of the many societies that constitute the\r\ninternational community. As Foreign Minister Amre\r\nMoussa stated in his statement before the General\r\nAssembly at this session,\r\n“Our community cannot be dependent on the\r\nachievements of one single society or tend to follow\r\none single culture. The true path lies in positive\r\ninteraction, complementarity and coexistence among\r\ncivilizations. It does not lie in the creation of causes\r\nfor conflict or in fanning the flames of confrontation\r\nand of clash between civilizations. If this is allowed to\r\nhappen, it will create a dangerous hotbed of world\r\ntension and will ultimately result in a grave loss for\r\none and all.” (A/53/PV.15, p. 15)\r\nOnce again we are at a historical juncture where a\r\nstrong message from our generation is indeed necessary.\r\nThis is the time and the place for such a message. We\r\nwant to see the rights of peoples and nations upheld\r\nwithout differences as to priorities and definitions. We\r\nwant our common political action to be established\r\nwithout double standards. We want rational disarmament\r\nand an end to the arms race and to the development of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, without distinction or\r\ndiscrimination. We want genuine development which does\r\nnot entrench poverty or ignore its causes. We want a\r\nclean environment, science which benefits all and\r\ntechnology whose achievements and applications are\r\nbeneficial to all. We want a common position in the face\r\nof international terrorism. We want freedom and\r\nliberation for all peoples and a firm stand in the face of\r\nthe forces of oppression, racism and occupation. We want\r\na commitment to the rule of law and respect for the\r\nestablished norms and for the purposes and principles we\r\nconsecrated in the United Nations Charter.\r\nIn order to achieve such results, dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is essential to enhance the concepts of\r\ncoexistence and tolerance and to reduce hatred and\r\nmistrust. It is our firm belief that if each civilization\r\nbecomes aware of the specificities of other civilizations\r\nwithin a rational dialogue, this will open the door wide\r\nfor better understanding and much more coexistence and,\r\nmost of all, will contribute to maintaining international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn entering such a dialogue, we have to emphasize\r\nthat no civilization has supremacy over another and that\r\ndialogue should be based on the equality of civilizations,\r\nregardless of how long they have existed, how developed\r\nthey are, how much they have achieved and how strong\r\ntheir beliefs and ideologies are. This is the cornerstone of\r\nthe success of such a dialogue.\r\nEgypt, which belongs to several civilizations —\r\nAfrican, Arab, Islamic and contemporary — has always\r\nbelieved in dialogue, not only within civilizations but\r\nalso, and more importantly, among peoples of different\r\ncivilizations. For this purpose and in order to confirm our\r\ncommitment to and enthusiasm for initiating such a\r\ndialogue, Egypt decided to co-sponsor the draft resolution\r\non this agenda item, which calls for concerted\r\ninternational efforts by Governments, the United Nations\r\nsystem and other relevant international and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations to plan and implement\r\nappropriate cultural, educational and social programmes\r\nto promote the concept of dialogue among civilizations.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nWe hope that Governments, international organizations\r\nand non-governmental organizations will spare no effort in\r\nadvancing the celebration of the year 2001 as the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, a dialogue\r\nthat would serve the whole international community.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): My delegation wishes to\r\nexpress its appreciation and commend the delegation of Iran\r\nfor the inscription on the agenda of the fifty-third session\r\nof the General Assembly of the important item “Dialogue\r\namong civilizations”. We consider the inscription timely\r\nand the idea visionary, because it gives us a fresh\r\nopportunity in this historic period for mankind to renew our\r\nresolve to promote, facilitate and enhance dialogue, which\r\nforms the cornerstone of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe are on the threshold of a new millennium,\r\nvisualizing a world that is even more interdependent and\r\ntechnologically oriented than at present and where every\r\naspect of human interchange — political, economic and\r\nsocial — is globalized. A local crisis in a place far removed\r\nfrom our borders or shores unfailingly and immediately\r\naffects us all. We are part, it seems, of the same global\r\nvillage, where our actions or omissions and our deeds or\r\nmisdeeds affect everyday life everywhere. Distances are\r\ndisappearing, and close interaction is ever present and ever\r\ngrowing.\r\nIn such a world, promoting cooperation, tolerance and\r\nunderstanding through dialogue is not only a lofty ideal and\r\na good policy; it is an imperative choice for survival. The\r\nworld has experienced much destruction and human misery\r\nin the present millennium. Common sense dictates that the\r\ncalamities which we have brought upon ourselves in the\r\npast — and some in the present — be avoided and that\r\npeace and cooperation replace confrontation and wars.\r\nIt is imperative, therefore, that we strengthen the\r\nbonds of the common destiny of mankind. The item under\r\nconsideration aims at this lofty goal. The Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations considers dialogue as the sine qua non\r\nmeans for harmonizing human relations and resolving the\r\ndifferences among States which are bound to arise. The\r\nCharter therefore places dialogue on the highest peak of\r\nhuman endeavours aimed at the effective solution of\r\ninternational problems.\r\nWe therefore consider the initiative of the President of\r\nIran, Mr. Mohammad Khatami, wise, visionary and, as we\r\nsaid earlier, timely. It is time to institutionalize dialogue\r\namong peoples of different cultures and civilizations if we\r\nare to serve the cause of peace and justice.\r\nWe need to be informed of the benefits of cultural\r\npluralism and the mutual enrichment of civilizations. It is\r\ntime also to address concerns over tendencies to portray\r\nspecific religions and cultures as threats to peace and\r\ncoexistence.\r\nOur survival ultimately depends on our success in\r\nconvincing the international community to peacefully\r\nsettle differences and disputes through dialogue in\r\naccordance with the principles of the United Nations and\r\nto promote dialogue as the accepted mode of behaviour.\r\nIt is through dialogue that my Government is\r\nstriving to reach a solution to the problem of Cyprus\r\nwhereby the two communities — Greek Cypriots and\r\nTurkish Cypriots — can live in peace and harmony, as\r\nthey have done for centuries in the past.\r\nIt is with these thoughts in mind that we have\r\nco-sponsored draft resolution A/53/L.23/Rev.1, introduced\r\nby Iran. It contains the necessary elements for\r\ninstitutionalizing dialogue among civilizations by\r\norganizing and implementing cultural, educational and\r\nsocial programmes by Governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. Furthermore, we fully\r\nsupport designating the year 2001 as the United Nations\r\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations, and we pray that\r\nthe next millennium will indeed be one of peace.\r\nMr. Manz (Austria): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union (EU). The Central and\r\nEastern European countries associated with the European\r\nUnion — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia — and the associated country Cyprus, as\r\nwell as the European Free Trade Association countries\r\nmembers of the European Economic Area — Iceland,\r\nLiechtenstein and Norway — align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nThe countries of the European Union know from\r\ntheir own historical experience that societies and cultures\r\nmust not be seen as isolated entities, especially in an\r\nincreasingly globalized world. For Europe, multi-ethnic\r\nand multicultural diversity has always been a reality.\r\nWhile creating an enormously rich heritage, it also\r\ngenerated conflicts, which often turned violent and\r\nresulted in disastrous wars. The countries that today form\r\nthe EU have finally found their way to peace and stability\r\nthrough democracy, pluralism and human rights, which\r\ncan only thrive in open and tolerant societies. We are\r\ntherefore not only committed to preserving and further\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nstrengthening these fundamental elements of peace within\r\nthe EU, but also to promoting international cooperation,\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law and human rights in our external\r\nrelations.\r\nIn 1993, only a few years after the cold war ended, we\r\nfirst read about the “clash of civilizations”, a new and\r\nrather pessimistic concept to describe and define the\r\npatterns of conflicts in a newly evolving, multipolar\r\ninternational system. At the end of this century, these\r\nconflicts seem to have grown in number and become\r\ncrueller and more violent. This may explain the theory’s\r\ninherent pessimism and also, I should add, its controversial\r\nreception.\r\nThe international community must not allow such\r\ntheories to turn into self-fulfilling prophecies. The history\r\nof our own continent has taught us bitter lessons about the\r\ndevastating effects of political theories and ideologies that\r\nbuild on human fears and causing destruction by exploiting\r\nthe human struggle for equality, dignity and identity. The\r\nEuropean Union therefore rejects the application of the\r\nclash theory to international relations and political practice.\r\nIn this context, we thank Iran for its initiative which\r\nhas been presented to us today. We strongly support\r\ndialogue among and within countries, cultures and religions.\r\nThis dialogue — the credibility of which can, at national\r\nlevels, be guaranteed only in conditions provided by\r\ndemocratic governance — already exists in a variety of\r\nforms and at all levels. But it has to be strengthened to\r\nreach its goal: to overcome errors and deficiencies of the\r\npast and to peacefully settle conflicts, remove their causes\r\nand limit tensions.\r\nDialogue at the national level can best be ensured in\r\na vibrant and participatory society based on the rule of law\r\nand respect for human rights, including the rights to\r\nfreedom of expression, religion and association and the\r\nrights of persons belonging to minorities, and on\r\nrepresentative and accountable government in which the\r\naspirations of all sectors of society are fully reflected.\r\nThe EU sees the United Nations as an ideal place to\r\nadvance the kind of dialogue that I just mentioned. The\r\nUnited Nations, as an Organization based on universal\r\nprinciples, has in fact done a great deal to establish a\r\nculture of dialogue in international relations in the aftermath\r\nof two catastrophic world wars. The United Nations Charter\r\nand those international legal norms of universal validity\r\nestablished as a result of a constant dialogue under the\r\naegis of the United Nations provide the common ethical and\r\nlegal grounds for the peaceful interaction we are aiming\r\nat. In this regard, may I just mention the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which has been\r\ncomplemented by a number of important conventions,\r\nincluding the International Covenant on Civil and Political\r\nRights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social\r\nand Cultural Rights, and the relevant declarations of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as a multitude of international\r\nconventions. The universality of human rights was again\r\nreconfirmed at the Vienna World Conference on Human\r\nRights in 1993.\r\nDialogue within this framework is a prerequisite for\r\npeace and stability in today’s world. In fact, it guarantees\r\nand protects creative diversity and pluralism. We must do\r\nour utmost to avoid the fragmentation of international\r\nlaw, international policies and cooperation under regional\r\nor cultural pretexts. We also recognize our own\r\nresponsibility in this matter.\r\nIn conclusion, we support the positive approach of\r\nthe initiative that has been presented to us today. We\r\nshould also like to express our appreciation for the\r\nconstructive approach taken during consultations by the\r\nauthors of the draft resolution. As a result of this\r\napproach, all the member States of the European Union\r\nare in a position to co-sponsor this draft resolution.\r\nMr. Rastam (Malaysia): I would like to commend\r\nthe delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its\r\ninitiative to include the new item entitled “Dialogue\r\namong civilizations” in the agenda of the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The proposal calling for\r\na dialogue among civilizations is both timely and relevant.\r\nIt brings into focus an issue of great importance which\r\nshould rightfully receive more attention from the\r\ninternational community beyond the realm of academic\r\ninterest.\r\nMy delegation firmly believes that dialogue should\r\nform the basis of interaction between peoples, nations and\r\ncivilizations. We have, just in this century, witnessed\r\nmany wars among nations and within them, large-scale\r\nmassacres, ethnic cleansing and genocide, intolerance,\r\nprejudice and disputes arising from political, economic,\r\nsocial or religious differences. Yet, also in this century,\r\nwe have experienced the tremendous benefits of\r\ncivilizational achievements arising from unprecedented\r\nhuman creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness. As we\r\nstand at the threshold of the new millennium, we continue\r\nto face the enormous challenge of preventing the\r\nrecurrence of the numerous tragic events as well as\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nexpanding further the limits of human knowledge and\r\nendeavour in all fields. The international community should\r\ntherefore work towards promoting a norm of interaction and\r\nrelations between nations based on dialogue, cooperation\r\nand mutual respect so as to maintain peace and security and\r\nencourage development and social progress throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nDialogue should be promoted as the accepted mode of\r\ninteraction and the means to resolve differences. Dialogue\r\namong civilizations is necessary to facilitate and enhance\r\ncross-cultural understanding. Too often we have seen how\r\nthe misunderstanding of and distortions about a nation,\r\nculture or individual have led to suspicion, mistrust, fear\r\nand prejudice, culminating in intolerance, dispute and even\r\nwar. It is thus important for the international community to\r\npromote, encourage and facilitate dialogue and\r\nunderstanding among various cultures and civilizations,\r\nthereby promoting peace, tolerance and cooperation.\r\nSamuel Huntington, in his article entitled “The Clash\r\nof Civilizations”, published a few years ago, hypothesized\r\nthat the clash of civilizations would dominate global\r\npolitics. If this hypothesis is anything to go by, it certainly\r\ncarries a very ominous prediction. It has created a healthy\r\ndebate among leaders, scholars and diplomats, giving rise\r\nto various interpretations and conclusions. The international\r\ncommunity must endeavour to prevent such a clash at all\r\ncosts. Thus, the call for a dialogue among civilizations is\r\nindeed timely.\r\nMy delegation believes that instead of looking at a\r\npossible clash of civilizations, we should strive to create a\r\nfruitful crossroad of civilizations, taking into consideration\r\nthat throughout human history interaction among\r\ncivilizations has brought about positive and mutually\r\nbeneficial results. We have much to learn from each other,\r\nand we must take the best that each has to offer the other.\r\nThe advent of multimedia technologies, the speed and ease\r\nof travel and telecommunications and the lightning-paced\r\ndissemination of information have provided us with a\r\ngreater opportunity for interaction between peoples. While\r\non the one hand promoting better understanding, such\r\ninteractions have, on the other, heightened civilizational\r\nconsciousness and the awareness of differences between\r\ncivilizations. Only through dialogue will we be able to\r\nfoster mutual understanding, mutual appreciation and\r\nmutual regard among civilizations, nations, cultures and\r\npeoples.\r\nCivilizations can be differentiated from each other by\r\nhistory, language, culture, tradition, world views and\r\nreligion. Civilizations are not static. They change with the\r\npassage of time. The values and customs of a society at\r\na particular period may differ from the values of the same\r\nsociety at a different period. My delegation believes that\r\nbecause of this dynamic state of civilizations, dialogue is\r\nnecessary. It is timely that the year 2001 be designated as\r\nthe United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations.\r\nMy delegation would also like to underline the need\r\nto observe certain principles which would be\r\nindispensable if we should seek to use dialogue as the\r\nmeans to maintain peace and security, develop friendly\r\nrelations among nations and peoples, enhance\r\ninternational cooperation and resolve international issues\r\nand problems. I would like to reiterate here the principles\r\nas enumerated by the Prime Minister of Malaysia,\r\nDr. Mahathir Mohamad, in his speech at the Second Asia-\r\nPacific Dialogue in Kuala Lumpur on 8 January 1996.\r\nFirst is the principle of the greatest welfare of\r\nhuman society and its members. When all is said and\r\ndone, this is the most profound concern of the State, the\r\nsociety and religion. The second principle is that of\r\nmutual respect, due respect for each other’s values,\r\ncultures, aspirations and abilities. These are no less\r\nmeaningful or important merely because they are not our\r\nown. Third is the principle of equality — equality of\r\nnations, be they large or small, powerful or weak. The\r\nfourth principle is a commitment to peace and peaceful\r\nmeans, which must underpin efforts to build international\r\nand regional security and manage differences among\r\nStates. Fifth, given our interdependence, is the principle\r\nof cooperation and mutual help. Unilateralism has become\r\na less productive option, even for the more powerful. The\r\nsixth principle is that of integrity — integrity to abide by\r\nthe very values, norms and principles which we profess\r\nand declare and expect others to live by.\r\nThe international community must make a concerted\r\neffort to make dialogue the accepted norm of interaction.\r\nThe threat of conflicts and the tendencies to invoke new\r\nrivalries and confrontations will always be present.\r\nHowever, efforts must be made to ensure that none of us\r\nresorts to force as a means to resolve our differences. We\r\nshould seek recourse through dialogue. In this regard, the\r\nUnited Nations has a central and important role to play in\r\nthe promotion of dialogue among civilizations and\r\ncultures. It is uniquely placed to bridge the gap between\r\npeoples, nations and civilizations. After all, the concept of\r\ndialogue is congruent with the basic purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nAs a nation, Malaysia may not be in a position to\r\nspeak of civilization’s glories of past millennia. However,\r\nwe have benefited from the rich cultural heritage of\r\ncivilizations of East and West. Malaysia is a multiracial,\r\nmulticultural and multireligious society. We have managed\r\nto maintain peace and harmony among the various ethnic\r\ngroups which now represent the confluence of different\r\ncivilizational and cultural heritages in modern Malaysian\r\nsociety. We have always believed in and have continuously\r\npropagated dialogue, understanding and tolerance as a\r\nmeans of promoting cooperation and acceptance within the\r\nMalaysian society.\r\nIn sponsoring and expressing my delegation’s full\r\nsupport for the draft resolution as contained in document\r\nA/53/L.23/Rev.1, which was initiated by the delegation of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, my delegation hopes that it\r\nwill have the unanimous support of the Assembly. We also\r\nhope that with the designation of the year 2001 as the\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, the\r\ninternational community will collectively contribute to the\r\nenhancement of understanding through constructive\r\ndialogue.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): We believe that the Iranian\r\ninitiative to inscribe on the agenda of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly an item on “Dialogue among\r\ncivilizations” is important. We were glad to speak in its\r\nsupport in the General Committee and to co-sponsor the\r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/53/L.23/Rev.1.\r\nThe United Nations was formed at the end of a war\r\nmore shattering than any the world had previously endured,\r\nafter the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and after the\r\ndeath of millions. Across the street from this building, on\r\nthe Ralph Bunche steps, are inscribed the stirring words\r\nfrom Isaiah:\r\n“And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and\r\ntheir spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up\r\nsword against nation, neither shall they learn war any\r\nmore.” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4)\r\nThe reality was less uplifting. Almost from its birth,\r\nthe United Nations found itself drawn into a series of\r\nskirmishes, with battle-lines drawn on political issues\r\nbetween two competing blocs, not so much setting nation\r\nagainst nation, as value system against value system. It was\r\na form of contention between two views of civilization.\r\nOn economic issues, there was a struggle between a\r\ncapitalist model and the ideas of countries emerging from\r\ncolonial rule, many of which were discovering for the\r\nfirst time the joys and responsibilities of nationhood and\r\nwho had doubts cast upon their civilizational values and\r\nworld views.\r\nOn social issues, a Western paradigm prevails. In\r\ninternational law, ancient systems of law and\r\njurisprudence from Asia and Africa, for instance, have not\r\nbeen part of the evolution of thought.\r\nTherefore, what we have had in the United Nations\r\nfor far too long is — sporadically — a failure of\r\nunderstanding and appreciation, and — frequently — a\r\ntension between civilizations. Instead of Isaiah, we have\r\nhad the words of Joel:\r\n“Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the\r\nmen of war draw near ... Beat your plowshares into\r\nswords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the\r\nweak say, I am strong.” (The Holy Bible, Joel 3:9\r\nand 10)\r\nClearly, we need tolerance, an acceptance that what\r\nis strange or foreign to us or to our way of thinking is not\r\nnecessarily threatening or uncivilized.\r\nThe word “barbaric”, we should remember, comes\r\nfrom “barbarikos”, the old Greek word for “foreigner”.\r\nWe must get rid of the unconscious prejudice that tends\r\nto equate what is foreign with what is barbaric. True\r\ncivilizations, no matter how wrapped in self-belief, never\r\naccept that. In Aeschylus’s “The Persians”, they\r\nacknowledge their antagonists as tragic and therefore, by\r\ndefinition, heroic. Unfortunately, though, as enemies\r\nbetween whom dialogue was not possible, throughout the\r\nplay Greeks and Persians exchange not a word. This is\r\nwhat must change.\r\nWe often hear that we live in and are moving ever\r\ndeeper into an information age. We are told that the\r\nworld has become a global village. But this is only\r\npartially true. On the one hand, the world has shrunk. It\r\nis a paradox that the explorers who set out to expand the\r\nborders of the known world ended up by reducing them.\r\nNo corner of the globe is truly inaccessible, but,\r\nexcluding the developed world, much of it is still terra\r\nincognita. In this village, not everyone knows each other,\r\nor about each other. The poor ones know about the rich,\r\nbut the latter know very little about the dispossessed.\r\nThe World Bank’s Development Report this year has\r\nas its theme “Knowledge for Development”. Although it\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\naddresses only a small segment of the problem, its analysis\r\nof the information needs of a globalized world is restricted\r\nonly to what developing countries need to do to make\r\nthemselves known and attractive to investors in the\r\nindustrialized world. There is no analysis and no\r\nacknowledgment of the need for the developed world to\r\nlearn about the cultures, backgrounds or special\r\ncharacteristics of the countries they invest in.\r\nThe recent crisis in South-East Asia, caused in part by\r\nthe sudden speculative withdrawal of foreign investments,\r\nwas perhaps an indicator of how a lack of empathy between\r\ncivilizations makes it easy to treat other people as objects.\r\nThe human crisis, the danger of social collapse and the\r\npossible crumbling of value systems that could follow from\r\neconomic meltdown were of no consequence to the\r\nmanagers of hedge funds on other continents, partly\r\nbecause the citizens of alien cultures meant very little to\r\nthem.\r\nHowever, in a globalized economy, if information is\r\nmoney or power, the acquaintance must be mutual.\r\nCivilizations must learn about each other and learn to value\r\neach other. It is worrying, therefore, that the uniquely\r\npowerful tool of this information age, the Internet, which\r\ncould be a web to bind us together, is filled instead with\r\ntawdry commerce and, unfortunately, with racial and\r\ncultural stereotypes. There is very little as yet in it to\r\npromote understanding among peoples. By definition, the\r\nInternet cannot be controlled, but, if there is enough\r\ninterest, it can be used to promote understanding rather than\r\nhatred. What can we in the United Nations do here?\r\nThe wars of the future, we are told, will be wars over\r\nscarce resources: water, perhaps other vital raw materials.\r\nFrom this flows the need to husband our resources, to make\r\ndevelopment sustainable while not constraining growth in\r\ndeveloping societies. We do not subscribe to the theory that\r\nconflict is inevitable. What would be unproductive would\r\nbe an attempt to prescribe universal solutions based on the\r\nexperience and preferences of a segment of the world’s\r\npopulation.\r\nAnd yet, on environmental issues, which all of us\r\nagree are crucial to the well-being of our planet, there is\r\noften a refusal to learn from the experience and the wisdom\r\nof civilizations that have been rooted in nature and have\r\nseen man and other forms of life as symbiotic, not as\r\nobjects of spoliation. There is a drift to lay down codes of\r\nenvironmental conduct that, in effect, make the developing\r\ncountries atone for the excesses of others. At its most\r\nextreme, this vicarious expiation takes the form of theories\r\nof “deep ecology”, in which, in a distortion of the beliefs\r\nof ancient Eastern civilizations, the needs of nature,\r\narbitrarily defined, take precedence over the needs of\r\nman. That, too, is something which would not be\r\naccepted. This world is a work as much of civilization as\r\nof nature; a dialogue between man and his environment,\r\nas between the civilizations that mould both, is needed to\r\nmake sure that the balance of nature is preserved.\r\nSeveral years ago, a former Secretary-General\r\nreminded us that the days of absolute sovereignty were\r\nover. Liberalization means a loss of control for national\r\nGovernments; so too does integration into a regional or\r\nthe global economy. In some parts of the developed\r\nworld, national borders have become blurred;\r\nGovernments have started to cede to supranational\r\norganizations powers over fiscal, foreign and defence\r\npolicies. In the developing world, Governments and their\r\npeoples find themselves at the mercy of global forces\r\nalmost impossible to comprehend, leave alone master. The\r\nfamiliar attributes of national identity are fading. Quite\r\noften, what men and women have left to define\r\nthemselves is a sense of the culture in which they have\r\nbeen brought up. If this becomes combatively defensive,\r\nculture can become the enemy of civilization; a\r\nkulturkampf, after all, led to the most virulently\r\ndestructive nationalism the world has seen in recent times.\r\nThis is why, in a globalized world, the need for a\r\ndialogue among civilizations is more critical than it has\r\never been.\r\nIn addition, almost every country has significant\r\nimmigrant populations; hardly any nation now is racially\r\nor culturally homogeneous. There is or should be an\r\nautomatic cross-fertilization of cultures — the materially\r\ndominant culture of the West, beamed into our living\r\nrooms through satellite television, leavened by the foreign\r\nblood it has taken in. In some countries, this has\r\nhappened, but that is rare. More often than not,\r\nimmigrants are alienated from the mainstream,\r\neconomically and socially disadvantaged. In reaction, they\r\ntry to recapture and preserve the cultures of their\r\nmotherland in an inhospitable setting; they face a choice\r\nbetween imperfect assimilation or an assertive display of\r\ncultural distinctiveness, which casts its dark shadow in the\r\nreturn of racism and xenophobia to countries from which\r\nthey had withdrawn for a while.\r\nIf we are not again to tread that bloody path, which\r\nreaped for us a terrible harvest in the past, it is essential\r\nthat our cultures not draw us into ghettoes and that,\r\ninstead, civilizations engage each other in dialogue and\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nseek to understand each other. The persistence of a sense of\r\ndifference is the seed of alienation of understanding. It can\r\nbe overcome through striving to value our collective\r\nheritage.\r\nWe have heard enough about the clash of civilizations.\r\nIt is time to discourse on harmony of civilizations and there\r\nis no more propitious place to do that than this, our\r\ncommon house, the United Nations, which we have to\r\nstrive harder to transform into the “Nations United”.\r\nWe conceive of all civilizations as the common\r\nheritage of mankind. If we dismantle the walls, they are\r\ncommon property. The civilizations we have inherited\r\nmanifest a potential of humankind and enrich us all,\r\nbecause they speak to us all. They widen our vision, refine\r\nour sensibilities and enhance our potential as humans. The\r\nancient wisdom of India pronounces that the world is a\r\nfamily. To internationalize this spirit is the true\r\nglobalization of the next millennium. We understand the\r\nmeaning of “unity in diversity” very well in India.\r\nAs nuclear weapons represent the apocalyptic threat\r\nwhich respects no civilization, it is the foremost task of\r\nhumankind to abolish them from the face of the Earth. This\r\nwould be the highest civilizational legacy we can bequeath\r\nto the countless unborn generations. Half a century ago, one\r\nof the fabricators of the atomic bomb, Robert Oppenheimer,\r\nawestruck by the furies he had helped release, could\r\nrecount the experience only in the words of a scripture of\r\na different civilization. It was, he said, quoting from the\r\nBhagavad Gita, “as if the light of a thousand suns had\r\nblazed forth at once and the creator had turned destroyer”.\r\nWe need a more gentle light to be shed on us, a light of the\r\nhighest reason, of concord, of human accomplishment and\r\nrichness of spirit — in a word, of faith in the future and\r\nour ability to fashion it.\r\nWriting in 1958, long before globalization became a\r\ncatchword or forecasts had been made about either the\r\ndeath of history or a clash of civilizations, Hannah Arendt\r\nwrote, as prophetically as any of the ancients, in her book\r\nThe Human Condition:\r\n“The decline of the European nation-state system; the\r\neconomic and geographic shrinkage of the Earth, so\r\nthat prosperity and depression tend to become\r\nworldwide phenomena; the transformation of mankind,\r\nwhich until our own time was an abstract notion or a\r\nguiding principle for humanists only, into a really\r\nexisting entity whose members at the most distant\r\npoints of the globe need less time to meet than the\r\nmembers of a nation needed a generation ago —\r\nthese mark the beginnings of the last stage in this\r\ndevelopment. Just as the family and its property\r\nwere replaced by class membership and national\r\nterritory, so mankind now begins to replace\r\nnationally bound societies, and the Earth replaces the\r\nlimited State territory. But whatever the future may\r\nbring, the process of world alienation, started by\r\nexpropriation and characterized by an ever\r\nincreasing progressing wealth, can only assume even\r\nmore radical proportions if it is permitted to follow\r\nits own inherent law.”\r\nIt is our challenge to disprove that dire prophecy.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic\r\nwould like to express its appreciation for the initiative of\r\nMr. Mohammad Khatami, President of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, a friendly country, of inscribing the item\r\n“Dialogue among civilizations” on the agenda and of\r\nproclaiming the year 2001 as the year for dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. This initiative deserves the attention of all\r\nStates in order to create a world free of destructive war\r\nand a world based on peace, understanding and equality\r\namong all States and peoples. The initiative, which stems\r\nfrom the purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter, draws its importance from the broad support it\r\nreceived at the Tehran Summit of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference and at the twelfth summit meeting of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Countries in Durban, South Africa.\r\nWhen we speak of dialogue among civilizations, the\r\ndelegation of the Syrian Arab Republic speaks from the\r\nvantage point of thousands of years of civilization to\r\nwhich it is committed. We speak of lands that saw the\r\nbirth of mankind and the burgeoning of the first\r\ncivilizations. We speak of a territory which is sacred, on\r\nwhich the prophets walked. The values which these\r\nprophets shaped constitute the basis of life for today’s\r\nman. From that land, the messages of the holy religions\r\nand science, art and literature, were conveyed. The Arab\r\ncivilization, to which I belong, is characterized by\r\ntolerance, giving and inspiration. The achievements of the\r\nArab civilization were a principal source of the scientific\r\nand cultural progress of the contemporary world. We also\r\nwish to emphasize that Arab civilization also benefitted\r\nfrom the achievements and contributions of other\r\ncivilizations. When we speak of the role of Arab\r\ncivilization, we also reaffirm its openness and its respect\r\nfor the heritage and values of other civilizations.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nThe initiative regarding dialogue among civilizations\r\nis an open invitation to the international community to open\r\nup future prospects for all peoples and States so that they\r\nmay effectively and equally contribute to greater progress\r\nfor our societies. The invitation has been extended in order\r\nto prevent obsolete concepts, such as colonialism,\r\nneocolonialism, racial discrimination, poverty and\r\nxenophobia, from widening the chasm between our States\r\nand societies. Dialogue among civilizations is a call to the\r\ninternational community to put an end to foreign\r\noccupation, with its injustice and violations of people’s\r\nvalues their right to life, freedom, sovereignty and progress.\r\nDialogue among civilizations also means dependency on\r\nmutual understanding instead of on nuclear weapons and\r\nother modern weapons aimed at imposing superiority by\r\nforce.\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic, under the leadership of\r\nHafez Al-Assad, basing itself on what our forefathers began\r\nfor us civilizationally, extends a hand to other civilizations\r\nand cultures in Africa, Asia, Europe and in the two\r\nAmericas, so that together we may build tomorrow’s\r\nsociety based on justice, equality and cooperation.\r\nThe draft resolution in document A/52/L.23, submitted\r\nto us today and which reaffirms in its broad context the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, the diversity of civilizational achievements and the\r\nimportance of positive interaction among civilizations,\r\nreflects our aspirations and the aspirations of the founders\r\nof the Organization. Our delegation hopes that the draft will\r\nbe adopted by consensus.\r\nMr. Fruchtbaum (Solomon Islands): The concept of\r\na dialogue among civilizations is important and complex. In\r\nfact its complexity is a measure of its importance. Much\r\nhas been published in recent years about the conflict\r\nbetween civilizations. Some have argued that the conflict is\r\nan inevitable consequence of profound differences between\r\ncivilizations. The Solomon Islands delegation rejects the\r\nclaim of inevitability and welcomes efforts to encourage\r\ncontinuous dialogues between peoples. We support draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.23, which designates the year 2001 as the\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, and\r\nwe thank the delegation of Iran for moving this proposal\r\nforward for our consideration.\r\nThe concept of a dialogue among civilizations,\r\nhowever, has its difficulties. For example, how are\r\ncivilizations to be defined for the Year of Dialogue? We\r\nhave no difficulty in recognizing the great civilizations in\r\nour time and in the history of humankind, but what\r\nrecognition is to be given to those cultures and\r\ncivilizations that comprise larger ones? What in fact is the\r\nrelationship between culture and civilization? These are\r\nquestions that anthropologists and historians have long\r\nstudied.\r\nClearly, much thought must be given to how the\r\nproposed United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations will be structured. Who, for example, will be\r\ncalled to participate in the dialogue? Will the talking be\r\ndone only by certain elites, to the exclusion of a wider\r\nrepresentation of society? How is serious dialogue, rather\r\nthan a series of unanswered monologues, to be fostered?\r\nHow will sensitive questions, such as the role of religion\r\nor human rights in civilization, be addressed? These are\r\nthe sorts of questions that we will have to consider. They\r\ncannot be left for resolution to the Secretariat or a\r\nspecialized agency. If the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations is to be successful, perhaps\r\neven the beginning of a decade or more of dialogue that\r\ncontributes to international understanding and cooperation,\r\nthe planning must begin here and be open to us all.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 3369 (XXX), of 10 October 1975, I\r\nnow call on the observer for the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference.\r\nMr. Lamani (Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference) (interpretation from Arabic): History bears\r\nwitness to the fact that the Islamic civilization is one of\r\nthe world’s eternal and brilliant civilizations. The reason\r\nfor its brilliance is the contribution of the Islamic nation\r\nto all of humanity in the spiritual, philosophical,\r\nscientific, literary, technical and other fields. The heritage\r\nof that nation has broad horizons, because is it a human\r\none that has extended over a long period of time. If the\r\nIslamic civilization was established on the basis of creed\r\nand belief, it was also established on the basis of creative\r\ncontributions in the fields of thought, literature and\r\nscience. Thanks to those pillars, the Islamic civilization\r\nhas guaranteed its own flowering, has laid down\r\nfoundations of life and has spread its reign of civility,\r\ndignity and respect.\r\nIslamic civilization is the product of a society that\r\nhas fostered interaction between the culture of its age,\r\nGreek sciences, and Persian wisdom. Furthermore, it has\r\ninteracted with other peoples from Africa, Asia and\r\nEurope. Other civilizations have drawn upon Islamic\r\ncivilization, taking turns in passing on the torch, thereby\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nconfirming the solidarity of humankind and the fact that\r\nhumanity is basically across one time and place.\r\nThe inter-civilizational interaction across the span of\r\nhistory has made stability either attainable or unachievable.\r\nAlthough history has never been consistently positive, in\r\nmost cases it has been alive and dynamic. We believe that\r\nthroughout its long history, humanity has never faced a\r\ndanger that has reached the proportions of the one we are\r\nwitnessing today, one which threatens our very existence.\r\nIt is true that all ages and all regions of the world have\r\nexperienced wars. In fact, entire peoples may have been\r\nsubjected to genocide, and continents and regions may have\r\nfaced destruction because of civil, colonial and religious\r\nwars. But no conflict has ever before threatened the very\r\nsurvival of humanity, and no danger has ever before held\r\nover humanity the spectre of its total elimination. Yet, this\r\nis our situation today with the existence of arsenals of\r\nnuclear and other weapons that are capable of liquidating\r\nall vestiges of life on earth.\r\nOn the other hand, the uncontrollable diffusion of\r\nmeans of communication has not contributed to the\r\nachievement of greater understanding between peoples or of\r\nmore solid bases for coexistence under a reign of peace.\r\nThus it is our hope that at the threshold of the new\r\nmillennium, humanity will pause to reflect upon its\r\ncommitment to the establishment of a better tomorrow and\r\nto the achievement of a brighter future.\r\nTherefore, we in the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC) consider that the initiative launched\r\nduring the OIC Summit by President Khatami of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, the Chairman of the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference, proposing that 2001 be\r\ndesignated the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, deserves every respect, attention and pursuit.\r\nThe Secretary-General of the OIC, Mr. Azeddine Laraki,\r\nhas established a working group on the organization of the\r\ndialogue among contemporary civilizations. That group met\r\nin Jeddah from 23 to 25 June 1998 to prepare for an\r\nIslamic seminar on the subject. It is expected that the\r\nseminar will take place next year, in line with the present\r\nefforts to achieve success in the dialogue among all human\r\ncivilizations.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like this dialogue to be a\r\nmeans for laying down solid foundations for a system based\r\non peaceful coexistence and for guaranteeing a future of\r\nharmonious diversity and complementarity between our\r\ncultures, in a framework of ensuring dignity and justice for\r\nall.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI shall now call on the representative of Japan, who\r\nwishes to speak in explanation of position before action\r\nis taken on the draft resolution.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote\r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Takasu (Japan): On behalf of my delegation, I\r\nwould like to express support for draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.23/Rev.1. It is the view of Japan that all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations share the spirit of this\r\ndraft resolution: that the international community must not\r\nresort to hostility and conflict in the face of an impasse,\r\nbut rather should seek a solution through peaceful\r\ndialogue and mutual understanding. In the same spirit,\r\nJapan, as a nation of culture and civilization, is actively\r\npromoting cultural and intellectual exchange and dialogue\r\nin various fields. It is our sincere hope that the nurturing\r\nof friendly relations among States and the encouragement\r\nof international cooperation through a dialogue among\r\ncivilizations will one day free the world from devastating\r\nconflicts and unnecessary bloodshed.\r\nThe significance of this draft resolution has been\r\nfurther increased by the incorporation of additional\r\nsuggestions. It is important for us to recall that tolerance\r\nand respect for diversity as stressed by the draft resolution\r\nare at the same time conducive to universal respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all. Through\r\ndialogue and mutual understanding, the international\r\ncommunity can reconfirm and strengthen its common\r\nvalues and goals, thereby enhancing the dignity of human\r\nbeings.\r\nFinally, Japan would like to express its gratitude to\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran for taking the initiative in\r\nintroducing this very important issue to the General\r\nAssembly and for its considerable effort to produce this\r\nconsensus draft.\r\nThe Acting President: Before proceeding to take\r\naction on the draft resolution I should like to announce\r\nthat the following countries have become sponsors of\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.23/Rev.1: Belarus, Benin, Finland,\r\nFrance, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Netherlands,\r\nNorway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.23/Rev.1.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.23/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.23/Rev.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 53/22).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of New Zealand in explanation of position on\r\nthe resolution just adopted, may I remind delegations that\r\nexplanations are limited to 10 minutes and should be made\r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Powles (New Zealand) New Zealand joins others\r\nin supporting this interesting initiative. We regard the whole\r\nquestion of a dialogue among civilizations as a huge and\r\nenormously important issue. The delegation of Iran and\r\nother sponsors of the resolution are to be commended for\r\nproviding this moment for us to pause and reflect on the\r\nlarger issues determining international relations.\r\nWe have not joined in sponsoring the resolution,\r\nhowever, because as a small Member of the Organization,\r\nwe have inevitably not been closely involved in the\r\ndiscussions on the original draft resolution which have\r\ntaken place.\r\nWe believe this initiative has the potential to have\r\nsignificant implications for the vexed question of North-\r\nSouth relations, tensions over which bedevil so much of\r\nwhat this Organization strives to do. New Zealand will\r\ntherefore enthusiastically support any initiatives, including\r\nthis one, involving a dialogue among civilizations which are\r\nlikely to be effective in reducing North-South tensions and\r\ndistrust.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only\r\nspeaker in explanation of position after adoption.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 168?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw the\r\nattention of the General Assembly to document\r\nA/INF/53/3/Add.3, which covers the programme of work\r\nfor the period from 10 November through 10 December\r\n1998. I note that the lists of speakers for all items\r\nmentioned in document A/INF/53/3/Add.3 are now open.\r\nI should like to inform representatives of changes to\r\nthe programme of work as it is set out in document\r\nA/INF/53/3/Add.2. Consideration of agenda item 59,\r\n“Question of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters”, has been moved from Tuesday, 10 November,\r\nto the afternoon of Thursday, 19 November.\r\nAgenda item 44, on the situation in Central America,\r\nwill be considered in the morning of Wednesday, 18\r\nNovember, as the second item, instead of on Thursday, 19\r\nNovember.\r\nI should also like to point out the following: on\r\nTuesday, 10 November, under agenda item 12, entitled,\r\n“Report of the Economic and Social Council”, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will consider a draft resolution on the\r\ninternational year of mountains, which is to be issued this\r\nFriday as document A/53/L.24; furthermore, on\r\nWednesday, 18 November, in the afternoon, under agenda\r\nitem 30, entitled “United Nations reform: measures and\r\nproposals”, it is expected that the General Assembly will\r\nconsider the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nenvironment and human settlements circulated in\r\ndocument A/53/463; on Wednesday, 25 November, in the\r\nmorning, the General Assembly will consider agenda item\r\n58, entitled, “Strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem”, together with agenda item 60, entitled\r\n“Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly”.\r\nMembers will recall that those two items were also\r\nconsidered together at the fifty-second session. It is\r\nexpected that the report of the Secretary-General on\r\narrangements and practices for the interaction of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in all activities of the United\r\nNations system, issued as document A/53/170, will be\r\nconsidered at that meeting.\r\nFurthermore, members are aware that there are still\r\na few agenda items for which no date has yet been\r\nindicated. The dates for the consideration of those items\r\nwill be announced in due course and sufficiently in\r\nadvance. The Assembly will also be kept informed of any\r\nadditions or changes to the programme of work.\r\nFinally, representatives are reminded that additional\r\ntime is needed for those draft resolutions involving\r\nchanges in the work programme or additional\r\nexpenditures, since\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 53rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 4 November 1998\r\nthey will require the preparation of a statement of\r\nprogramme budget implications by the Secretary-General\r\nand, furthermore, the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth\r\nCommittee will need adequate time to review the\r\nprogramme budget implications of any draft resolutions\r\nbefore draft resolutions can be acted on by the Assembly.\r\nIn this connection, representatives submitting draft\r\nresolutions are kindly requested to do so sufficiently in\r\nadvance of the dates fixed for consideration of items in\r\norder to give members adequate time to examine them.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.55 a.m.\r\n15\r\n"
