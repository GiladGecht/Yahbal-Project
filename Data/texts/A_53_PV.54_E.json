(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mungra\r\n(Suriname), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim,\r\nHead of State of the Comoros\r\nThe Acting President: This morning, before we take\r\nup the items on our agenda, it is my sad duty to pay tribute\r\nto the memory of the late head of State of the Islamic\r\nFederal Republic of the Comoros, His Excellency\r\nMr. Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim, who passed away on\r\n5 November 1998.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I request the\r\nrepresentative of the Comoros to convey our condolences\r\nto the Government and the people of the Comoros and to\r\nthe bereaved family of Mr. Abdoulkarim.\r\nI invite representatives to stand and observe a minute\r\nof silence in tribute to the memory of Mr. Abdoulkarim.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a\r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nSudan, who will speak on behalf of the Group of African\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Erwa (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\n“Among the Believers are men\r\nWho have been true to\r\nTheir covenant with Allah:\r\nOf them some have died\r\nAnd some (still) wait:\r\nBut they have never changed\r\n(Their determination) in the least.” (The Holy Koran,\r\nXXXIII:23)\r\nThis is a sad time to address the General Assembly\r\non behalf of the Group of African States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. On behalf of the entire African continent\r\nand indeed the entire world, we express our sadness at the\r\ndeath of the late President of the fraternal Comoros, Mr.\r\nMohamed Taki Abdoulkarim.\r\nOn behalf of the African Group, I convey our\r\nsincere condolences to the delegation of the Comoros and,\r\nthrough that delegation, to the Government and the people\r\nof that fraternal country and to the family of the late\r\nPresident, who was a major African figure. We ask God\r\nto take President Abdoulkarim to his bosom, and to\r\ninspire his family and people with fortitude and solace.\r\nThe deeds of President Abdoulkarim were many and\r\nvaluable. He ranked among the best of statesmen; he was\r\nan outstanding leader of the Comoros. History will testify\r\nto his many achievements. Since he took power at a\r\ndifficult time in the history of the Comoros, of which we\r\nare all aware, President Abdoulkarim saw his mission as\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nserving his people as leader and guiding them to success,\r\nand as serving the goal of his country’s unity and solidarity,\r\ncontinuing his record, which was replete with struggle. For\r\nthat struggle he suffered and was imprisoned. He was\r\nelected to lead his country, winning the votes of the\r\nmajority of voters among his people, he gained respect\r\nfrom his people and recognition from international and\r\nregional organizations thanks to his self-sacrificing\r\ncommitment to the development of a society based on\r\nvirtue, morality, respect for human rights, and respect for\r\nthe will of his people.\r\nWith the death of this wise leader, the fraternal\r\nComoros has lost a great and wise man and a capable\r\nleader. This is a loss not solely for the Comoros, but for all\r\nof Africa, which aspires to having responsible leaders like\r\nMr. Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim. We ask God to take him\r\nand to forgive him, along with all martyrs.\r\nThe Acting President: I call next on the\r\nrepresentative of Oman, who will speak on behalf of the\r\nGroup of Asian States.\r\nMr. Al-Hinai (Oman): On behalf of the Group of\r\nAsian States I have the distinct honour to join other\r\nmembers of the General Assembly in paying a special\r\ntribute to the memory of the late President of the Islamic\r\nFederal Republic of the Comoros, His Excellency\r\nMr. Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim. Mr. Abdoulkarim had a\r\ndistinguished political career, having held important\r\npositions in successive Administrations since the Comoros\r\nachieved its independence in 1975. He played a prominent\r\nrole in international affairs, with active participation, along\r\nwith his fellow heads of State, in meetings of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference and the League of Arab States. We\r\nrecognize that the passing away of Mr. Abdoulkarim is an\r\nimmeasurable loss to the Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros and the cause of tremendous grief among its\r\npeople.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of Asian States, I would like\r\nto request the Permanent Representative of the Comoros to\r\nconvey the condolences of the Group to the Government\r\nand the people of the Comoros, and especially to the family\r\nof President Abdoulkarim. We pray that God will grant\r\nthem the patience to bear this great loss. May the soul of\r\nPresident Abdoulkarim rest in eternal peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative of\r\nRomania, who will speak on behalf of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States.\r\nMr. Gorita (Romania): It is with profound regret\r\nthat the countries of the Eastern European Group have\r\nlearned of the untimely passing away of the President of\r\nthe Islamic Federal Republic of Comoros, Mohamed Taki\r\nAbdoulkarim. As an outstanding participant in the\r\npolitical life of his country for many years and since his\r\nelection as head of State in March 1996, President\r\nAbdoulkarim has vigorously worked for the political\r\nstability and economic progress of the country and the\r\nwell-being of the people of the Comoros.\r\nAt this moment of deep sorrow, on behalf of the\r\nGroup of Eastern European States, I wish to present to\r\nthe President ad interim of the Comoros, to the\r\nGovernment and people of the Comoros and, foremost, to\r\nthe bereaved family our heartfelt condolences. We are\r\nconfident that this sad event will further mobilize the\r\nComorian people in their efforts to achieve a peaceful\r\nsettlement of the country’s political and economic\r\nproblems.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Ecuador, who will make a statement on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Izquierdo (Ecuador) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): On behalf of the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States, the delegation of Ecuador wishes to\r\nexpress our most heartfelt condolences to the Government\r\nand people of the Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros at the regrettable passing away on 5 November\r\n1998 of their head of State, His Excellency Mr. Mohamed\r\nTaki Abdoulkarim. The Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States would like to associate itself in\r\nsolidarity with this special and heartfelt tribute to the\r\nmemory of Mr. Abdoulkarim, who was a notable\r\nstatesman and a political leader of great importance to his\r\ncountry and to the international community. His presence\r\nin the history of his country will always be remembered.\r\nThe delegation of Ecuador would be grateful to the\r\ndelegation of Comoros if it would convey this message of\r\nfriendship from the member countries of the Group of\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States to the family of the\r\ndeceased, the authorities and the people of the Islamic\r\nFederal Republic of the Comoros.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Australia, who will make a statement on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Western European and other\r\nStates.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nMr. Smith (Australia): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Western European and other States.\r\nIt is my sad duty to extend sincere condolences on\r\nbehalf of the Group to the people and Government of the\r\nIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros on the untimely\r\ndeath of their head of State, His Excellency Mr. Mohamed\r\nTaki Abdoulkarim.\r\nPresident Abdoulkarim was an important figure in the\r\npolitical life of Comoros for decades, with a career\r\nculminating in his election as President in March 1996.\r\nHistory will attest to his achievements as President and to\r\nthe contribution he made to the advancement of his people.\r\nOur thoughts are with the people and Government of\r\nComoros at this difficult time.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Yemen, who will make a statement on\r\nbehalf of the Group of Arab States.\r\nMr. Al-Ashtal (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nOn behalf of the Group of Arab States, I wish to express\r\nour most sincere condolences to the Government and people\r\nof the Comoros islands on the untimely death of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim, who assumed\r\nthe presidency of his country on 25 March 1996 after\r\nhaving played a great role in building the Comoros. This is\r\na great loss for the people of the Comoros and for the\r\nentire continent of Africa.\r\nWe in the Group of Arab States would like to express\r\nour heartfelt condolences, and we pray to God that He will\r\nbring peace to the family of the deceased. We ask that the\r\nPermanent Representative of Comoros convey our\r\ncondolences to the people of Comoros.\r\nMay God forgive him and give him peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the United States of America, who will\r\nmake a statement on behalf of the host country.\r\nMs. Montoya (United States of America): The\r\nGovernment of the United States would like to express its\r\ncondolences to the family of President Abdoulkarim and to\r\nthe people of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros.\r\nWe recall that at a time of our own national grief —\r\nthe tragic crash of a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane in\r\nthe Indian Ocean — President Abdoulkarim and the people\r\nof the Comoros aided American victims of the crash, their\r\nfamilies and the United States Government. We also\r\nrecall the assistance and support of the President in the\r\naftermath of a second national tragedy, the terrorist\r\nattacks on our embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam.\r\nAt this critical juncture for the young democracy in\r\nthe Comoros, we call on the Government and the people\r\nto pull together and work as one for the good of the\r\nnation. That is the best and most appropriate way to\r\nhonour the memory of President Abdoulkarim — through\r\nthe triumph of constitutional forces in the Comoros in\r\nensuring the safe and legal succession of a new head of\r\nState.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Federal Republic of the\r\nComoros, Mr. Mohamed Aboud Mahmoud.\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Comoros) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): It is with great emotion that the delegation of\r\nthe Comoros has listened to the tributes you have just\r\npaid to our late President of the Republic, His Excellency\r\nHajj Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim. On behalf of my\r\nGovernment and the people of the Comoros, we would\r\nlike to extend our most sincere thanks to all the Member\r\nStates and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who has also paid a fervent tribute to\r\nour President.\r\nI would first like to assure you that this interim\r\nperiod is proceeding calmly and peacefully. In accordance\r\nwith article 10 of the Comorian Constitution, the High\r\nCouncil of the Republic, having been charged by the\r\nGovernment, took note of the passing away of the\r\nPresident of the Republic and conveyed interim power of\r\nthe presidency to Mr. Tadjidine Ben Saïd Massonde,\r\nPresident of the High Council of the Republic, who also\r\nsits on the Constitutional Council.\r\nI would like to recall some good memories of my\r\nPresident by describing some of his accomplishments.\r\nBorn in M’Beni, Comoros, in 1936, Mr. Mohamed Taki\r\nAbdoulkarim was the fourth President of the Comoros,\r\nand it can be said that he was representative of the first\r\nComorian political generation. He was distinguished by\r\nhis dynamism and sense of responsibility and was elected\r\na deputy of the Territorial Assembly of the Comoros in\r\n1967 to represent his region.\r\nHe also held several ministerial portfolios before the\r\nComoros attained independence. A tireless champion of\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nindependence, he was not surprised when that goal was\r\nachieved on 6 July 1975. However, he also encountered\r\npolitical setbacks that led to his imprisonment and exile. In\r\n1978 he was elected Deputy to the Federal Assembly as\r\nwell as its President. Then, in 1985, he was for the first\r\ntime forced into exile because of his political convictions.\r\nAfter a five-year exile in France, he returned to the\r\nComoros in 1990, running in the presidential elections held\r\nfollowing the assassination of the President of the Republic,\r\nMr. Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane, by a group of\r\nmercenaries. He lost to Mr. Saïd Mohamed Djohar.\r\nFollowing the 1995 coup d’état, he appeared to be the clear\r\nchoice to restore the State’s authority and initiate national\r\nrecovery. He ran for election in 1996 and was elected to\r\nreplace Mr. Djohar.\r\nA man of dialogue, he appealed to all political groups\r\nto restore the archipelago’s legitimacy. In the framework of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity, the French-speaking\r\nworld and the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean,\r\nPresident Taki was one step ahead of his counterparts in\r\nchampioning the idea of strengthened South-South\r\ncooperation. Within the framework of the French-speaking\r\nworld, he recalled the archipelago’s profound dedication to\r\nthe common cultural heritage shared by millions of men\r\nand women on various continents.\r\nHe supported the idea of the integration of a broad\r\nregional market among the countries of the Committee on\r\nthe Indian Ocean. Likewise, in the framework of the\r\nLeague of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, he recalled that the principle of solidarity must\r\ngovern relations among its members. Finally, he\r\nendeavoured to strengthen bilateral relations through\r\nagreements that opened up the way for common\r\ndevelopment and educational support projects.\r\nIn keeping with the legitimate aspirations of President\r\nTaki, I should like from this rostrum solemnly to appeal to\r\nthe international community to help my country find a\r\nsolution to the separatist crisis plaguing it. The unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of the Comoros are being threatened.\r\nThe very foundation of our State is in jeopardy, as are\r\npeace and stability in Africa and the Indian Ocean. This\r\nsets a dangerous precedent for the rest of the world.\r\nResolving the Anjouan crisis will require international\r\nsolidarity and a commitment by the Arab and African\r\ncountries. Now more than ever measures should be taken\r\nnot only to resolve the current crisis but also to ensure\r\npeace and stability, which are a guarantee of lasting and\r\nharmonious economic and social development for the region\r\nand for the Comoros.\r\nThe Comoros is in mourning, and the Comorian\r\npeople have been orphaned. President Taki wanted to\r\nreconcile and pacify an entire people and open the\r\nComoros to the outside world and to globalization. The\r\ninternational community has lost one of its children —\r\none who was deeply dedicated to the cause of peace,\r\nsecurity and stability in the south-west Indian Ocean\r\nregion.\r\nAgenda item 3\r\nCredentials of representatives to the fifty-third session\r\nof the General Assembly\r\n(b) Report of the Credentials Committee (A/53/556)\r\nThe Acting President: The draft resolution\r\nrecommended by the Credentials Committee in paragraph\r\n11 of its report reads as follows:\r\n“The General Assembly,\r\n“Having considered the report of the\r\nCredentials Committee and the recommendation\r\ncontained therein,\r\n“Approves the report of the Credentials\r\nCommittee.”\r\nMr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): I only wish to make the following observation\r\noutside the framework of the procedures of the General\r\nAssembly on the report of the Credentials Committee.\r\nIt is well known to all members that the Twelfth\r\nMinisterial Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries recognized that the participation of Israel in the\r\nwork of the General Assembly should be in accordance\r\nwith international law. Consequently, the credentials of\r\nIsrael should not cover the territories occupied since\r\n1967, including Jerusalem/Al-Quds.\r\nIt is also well known that the Coordinating Bureau\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement instructed the Chairman of\r\nthat Bureau to send a letter to the Chairman of the\r\nCredentials Committee to let him and the Committee\r\nmembers know what the heads of State or Government of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement had decided. We have been\r\ngiven to understand that this letter was conveyed to the\r\nCommittee after it had convened its first meeting.\r\nTherefore, we hope that — regardless of the fact that the\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nCommittee and the General Assembly will have already\r\nacted on the issue in question — the next report of the\r\nCredentials Committee will reflect that as an objective fact.\r\nThe Acting President: We shall now proceed to\r\nconsider the draft resolution recommended by the\r\nCredentials Committee in paragraph 11 of its report.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations\r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI wish at the outset, on behalf of the delegation of Egypt,\r\nto thank the Chairman and the members of the Credentials\r\nCommittee for the report contained in document A/53/556.\r\nThe delegation of Egypt recognizes that the draft\r\nresolution before us is always adopted by consensus. Egypt\r\nwill join the consensus on the draft this year, and wishes to\r\nregister that the credentials of the delegation of Israel apply\r\nonly to Israel in its borders of 4 June 1967 and not to the\r\nterritories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Al-\r\nQuds/Jerusalem. Our acceptance of the consensus adoption\r\nof the report does not constitute any recognition of Al-\r\nQuds/Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\r\nThis is in keeping with the provisions of international\r\nlaw and international legitimacy. Our position was\r\nexpressed at the Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nheld in Durban last September, which underlined the\r\nfollowing:\r\n“The Israeli representation in the work of the United\r\nNations General Assembly should be in consonance\r\nwith international law. Consequently, we have to\r\nconfirm that the Israeli credentials do not cover the\r\nterritories occupied since 1967, including Al-\r\nQuds/Jerusalem.”\r\nThis position is also contained in a letter of 21\r\nOctober addressed by the Permanent Representative of\r\nSouth Africa, as representing the head of the Movement, to\r\nthe Chairman of the Credentials Committee. That letter was\r\nnot mentioned in the report before the Assembly today.\r\nMr. Zamaninia (Islamic Republic of Iran): I am\r\ntaking the floor to express the reservation of my delegation\r\nregarding the part of the report of the Credentials\r\nCommittee contained in document A/53/556 that relates\r\nto the credentials of Israel. My delegation notes that draft\r\nresolutions on this subject are routinely adopted without\r\na vote. Hence, in line with the position of the\r\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran on this issue,\r\nmy delegation wishes to dissociate itself from the part of\r\nthe report that refers to the approval of the credentials of\r\nIsrael.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the voting, and we\r\nshall now take a decision on the draft resolution\r\nrecommended by the Credentials Committee in paragraph\r\n11 of its report (A/53/556).\r\nThe Credentials Committee adopted the draft\r\nresolution without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly\r\nwishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 53/23).\r\nThe Acting President: We have thus concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda\r\nitem 3.\r\nAgenda item 12\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.24)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Kyrgyzstan to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.24.\r\nMs. Eshmambetova (Kyrgyzstan): On behalf of 130\r\nsponsors, I am very pleased to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.24, entitled “International Year of Mountains”.\r\nThe draft resolution proclaims the year 2002 as the\r\nInternational Year of Mountains. This date has been\r\nagreed upon by most delegations. Symbolically, the\r\nInternational Year of Mountains will coincide with\r\nRio+10, the 10-year overall review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. It will also be preceded in\r\nthe year 2000 by the eighth session of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development, which will focus on land\r\nresources, including mountain resources.\r\nThe draft resolution further invites the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, as task\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nmanager for chapter 13 of Agenda 21, to serve as the lead\r\nagency for the year, and it calls upon Governments,\r\nnational and international non-governmental organizations\r\nand the private sector to make voluntary contributions and\r\ngive other forms of support to the International Year of\r\nMountains.\r\nIt also encourages all Governments, the United\r\nNations system and all other actors to take advantage of the\r\nInternational Year of Mountains to increase awareness of\r\nthe importance of sustainable mountain development.\r\nMountains or highlands make up more than a quarter\r\nof the earth’s land surface and are home to approximately\r\n10 per cent of the world’s population. More than half of the\r\nworld’s population depends on mountain resources for\r\nwater, biodiversity, recreation, agriculture, forestry and\r\nmining, among other things. Some of these resources are of\r\nmore than national or regional importance; they have a truly\r\nglobal significance for the future of our planet.\r\nMountains are a great source of fresh water. All of the\r\nworld’s largest rivers originate in the mountains. Because\r\nthey store immense amounts of fresh water as ice and\r\nsnow, and in lakes and reservoirs, mountains play a global\r\nrole in supplying water for agriculture, industry and urban\r\ncentres in adjacent lowlands. Since 35 per cent of the\r\nworld’s population is likely to experience water scarcity by\r\nthe year 2025, water management and economic\r\ncooperation between riparian States will become extremely\r\nimportant in the twenty-first century.\r\nMountains are core areas of global biodiversity. They\r\nare sanctuaries for a great wealth of endemic species,\r\nspecialized ecosystems and remarkable landscapes. Tropical\r\nand subtropical mountains, in particular, include major\r\ncentres of global biodiversity. Many mountain regions with\r\nthe greatest biological and landscape diversity are protected\r\nareas. In fact, of the 785 million hectares of protected areas\r\nin the world, one third are in the mountains, in 65 different\r\ncountries. Genetic material in plants, animals and micro-\r\norganisms holds potential for purposes of agriculture, the\r\nhealth and welfare of human beings and environmental\r\nprotection. Thus, mountain areas play the most important\r\nrole in the sustainable use and long-term preservation of\r\nbiodiversity on our planet.\r\nMore than half of the world’s population lives in\r\nurban areas, and urbanization will continue in the next\r\ncentury. The rapid increase in global urbanization means\r\ngreater demand for leisure and recreational areas.\r\nMountains have the most attractive potential in this regard,\r\nas they offer a rich variety of vast, natural landscapes.\r\nMountains play an important role in tourism, the world’s\r\nlargest industry, which employs more than 200 million\r\npeople, one tenth of the world’s workforce. To strike a\r\nbalance between economic interests and ecological aspects\r\nis in the interest of both the local and the global\r\npopulation.\r\nSustainable mountain development and resource use\r\nis only possible by, and for, the mountain communities.\r\nLocal knowledge and experience are necessary to sustain\r\necosystems, livelihoods and production. However, they\r\nmust be integrated carefully with new techniques and\r\nresearch findings. Governments must be ready to make\r\nproportionately greater investments to train and educate\r\npeople in mountain regions and to compensate the\r\nstewards of mountain resources. Governments have a\r\ngreat responsibility for these so-called peripheral regions\r\nand their vital resources. The decentralization of power\r\nfrom capital cities to mountain regions, towns and villages\r\nwould be one of the best ways to empower mountain\r\ninhabitants, reduce costs, increase efficiency and create\r\nthe necessary interest in sustainable development and\r\nmanagement of mountain resources.\r\nMountains are dynamic landscapes which are\r\nchanging on a global scale, probably much more rapidly\r\nthan any other major environmental system. Enormous\r\nobstacles facing sustainable mountain development in the\r\ntwenty-first century will not be overcome unless the\r\nproblems are recognized and addressed by local\r\ncommunities, national policy makers and international\r\norganizations.\r\nChapter 13 of Agenda 21, adopted in Rio in 1992,\r\nrecognized the vital and interrelated importance of this\r\nmajor ecosystem to the survival of the global ecosystem.\r\nIt further emphasized the need to encourage the regional,\r\nnational and international networking of people’s\r\ninitiatives and the activities of international, regional and\r\nlocal non-governmental organizations working on\r\nmountain development. Such an initiative originated at an\r\ninternational conference held in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, in\r\n1996 on “Mountain research: challenges and directions for\r\nthe twenty-first century”. The participants in that\r\nconference adopted a resolution which called upon the\r\ninternational community to proclaim an international year\r\nof mountains with the idea of highlighting the importance\r\nand advancing the cause of sustainable mountain\r\ndevelopment. The proposal was strongly supported by the\r\nPresident of Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Askar Akayev, in his letter\r\nto the Secretary-General.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nThe Economic and Social Council, in its resolution\r\n1997/45, entitled “Proclamation of an international year of\r\nmountains”, adopted at its substantive session in Geneva,\r\nwelcomed and supported ongoing efforts to protect fragile\r\nmountain ecosystems and to promote sustainable mountain\r\ndevelopment. It further requested the Secretary-General to\r\nseek the views of Governments and relevant international,\r\nregional and non-governmental organizations on the\r\ndesirability of proclaiming an international year of\r\nmountains.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General, prepared on the\r\nbasis of the replies from Governments, non-governmental\r\norganizations, United Nations agencies and submitted at the\r\nsubstantive session of the Economic and Social Council last\r\nsummer in New York, showed that although there is a\r\ngreater recognition of the importance of mountains for the\r\nglobal economy, society and the environment, great efforts\r\nare still needed at all levels to protect, conserve and\r\nsustainably manage these resources.\r\nAt that session the Economic and Social Council\r\nsession adopted a resolution recommending that the General\r\nAssembly proclaim an international year of mountains, as\r\nthis would provide an impetus for achieving the objectives\r\nof Chapter 13 on sustainable mountain development. We\r\nvery much hope that the General Assembly will follow this\r\nrecommendation by the Economic and Social Council and\r\nadopt the draft resolution by consensus.\r\nMr. Ghimire (Nepal): In line with Economic and\r\nSocial Council resolution 1997/45 of 22 July 1997, entitled\r\n“Proclamation of an international year of mountains”, my\r\ndelegation is pleased to express its full support both in\r\nterms of the desirability of this proclamation and, most\r\nimportantly, in terms of taking appropriate action to ensure\r\nthe sustainability of mountain countries.\r\nAs Nepal has the unique distinction of being home to\r\nmost of the world’s tallest mountains, we believe that the\r\nproclamation of an International Year of Mountains not\r\nonly recognizes the need for preserving the global life\r\nsupport system so indispensable to the survival of the\r\nglobal ecosystem, but also provides a sound basis for\r\nfurther substantive work on mountain development, thus\r\nhaving a truly global significance for the future of mankind.\r\nIt would be in order to mention that the Kathmandu-\r\nbased International Centre for Integrated Mountain\r\nDevelopment stands to contribute to attaining environmental\r\nsustainability and poverty eradication in the Himalaya-\r\nHindu Kush region.\r\nIn recent years, the Centre has intensified its efforts\r\nto promote the sustainability of mountain farming systems\r\nand sustainable management of mountain natural\r\nresources, to build national capacities for preparing and\r\nimplementing strategies for sustainable mountain\r\ndevelopment and to establish a strong information base —\r\na network — on the sustainable development of the\r\nHimalaya-Hindu Kush region, among other things.\r\nIn the view of the Nepalese delegation, the\r\nproclamation of the International Year of Mountains is a\r\nmodest first step towards environmental sustainability and\r\npoverty eradication, areas which need to be addressed\r\nmore effectively throughout the world. It is also our view\r\nthat such a solemn gesture would contribute to finding\r\nways and means to ensure the sustainable development of\r\nmountain countries.\r\nIt is in this spirit that we emphasize the imperative\r\nneed to use our resources and opportunities, combined\r\nwith international collaborative efforts and an\r\ninterdisciplinary scientific approach, to come up with an\r\neffective and viable plan aimed in this direction.\r\nMr. Zipper (France) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe proclamation of the Year 2002 as the International\r\nYear of Mountains is a very welcome initiative, for which\r\nI want to express warm thanks to Kyrgyzstan, which has\r\nenthusiastically and steadfastly inspired the draft\r\nresolution before us.\r\nThe draft resolution will enable us to strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation in the area of mountains,\r\nespecially at the regional and subregional levels, to raise\r\npublic awareness through a wide variety of activities and\r\nto intensify exchanges of information and of experiences\r\nin order, inter alia, to identify and disseminate\r\ninformation about good practice in this respect.\r\nFrance is particularly sensitive to the need to\r\npreserve and develop mountain regions, but these efforts\r\ncan be effective only if they take place within an\r\ninternational framework. Hence, my country, for example,\r\nconcluded the International Convention for the Protection\r\nof the Alps (Alpine Convention) with its neighbours.\r\nFor all of these reasons, my country has decided, as\r\nit did at the last session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, to co-sponsor this draft resolution, and we will\r\nstrive to make the International Year of Mountains a\r\nmemorable event.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly will\r\nnow proceed to take a decision on draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.24, entitled “International Year of Mountains”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the\r\ndraft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.24 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/24).\r\nThe Acting President: We have thus concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 12.\r\nAgenda item 31\r\nCulture of peace\r\nNote by the Secretary-General, transmitting the\r\nreport of the Director-General of the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (A/53/370 and Add.1 and 2)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.25)\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers that, in a letter dated 14 October 1998 addressed\r\nto the President of the General Assembly, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Andorra to the United Nations, in his\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Group of Western European\r\nand Other States for the month of October, requests that the\r\nGeneral Assembly hear in plenary meeting a statement by\r\nthe observer of the Holy See on agenda item 31, “Culture\r\nof peace”.\r\nTaking into account the importance attached to the\r\nissue under discussion, it is proposed that the General\r\nAssembly take a decision on that request.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the proposal\r\nto hear the observer of the Holy See on this agenda item?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Bangladesh to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/53/L.25.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): It is a particular\r\npleasure for my delegation to initiate the discussion on\r\nagenda item 31, entitled “Culture of peace”. We have\r\nbefore us the Secretary-General’s report in document\r\nA/53/370, containing the draft declaration and programme\r\nof action on a culture of peace.\r\nLast year, Bangladesh was honoured to present to\r\nthe General Assembly in plenary meeting, on behalf of 50\r\ncountries, the draft of resolution 52/13 on a culture of\r\npeace, which was adopted by consensus. The present\r\nconsolidated report has been prepared in accordance with\r\nthat resolution and contains recommendations which we\r\nbelieve are valuable and action-oriented and will\r\ncontribute to the global spread of a culture of peace.\r\nAs the introduction of the report says, in a rapidly\r\nchanging world characterized by the growing importance\r\nof ethical issues, a culture of peace provides future\r\ngenerations with values that can help them to shape their\r\ndestiny and actively participate in constructing a more\r\njust, humane, free and prosperous society and a more\r\npeaceful world.\r\nAt this point of human history, why is it so\r\nimportant to have a culture of peace? The answer appears\r\nto be an obvious one if we look at the nature of the\r\nconflict and social strife that are experienced all across\r\nthe world. We see that inter-State wars and occupation\r\nhave been on the decline since the end of the cold war.\r\nThis should have contributed to a lessening of violence,\r\nbut the reverse appears to be the case. As we approach\r\nthe next millennium, we are alarmed at the endemic\r\nviolence that stems from intra-State conflicts, social strife,\r\ndeprivation, the suppression of human rights, control over\r\nscarce resources, ethnicity, racism and xenophobia.\r\nThe defence against violence will have to be\r\nconstructed not in the actions of States alone, but above\r\nall in the minds of women and men, children and adults\r\nalike. That defence will be the inculcation of the culture\r\nof peace and non-violence in every human being. The\r\nmain elements of the culture of peace will include respect\r\nfor life and all human rights; rejection of violence;\r\ninculcation of the principles of freedom, justice and\r\ndemocracy; tolerance and solidarity among individuals\r\nand peoples; addressing the root causes of conflicts;\r\nproblem-solving through dialogue and negotiation;\r\nfreedom of expression and opinion and the right to\r\ninformation; and full and effective participation in\r\ndevelopment processes.\r\nWhen we consider these elements, we realize\r\nimmediately that the culture of peace is no new invention.\r\nIt is a set of values and principles that are respected and\r\nheld in high esteem in all societies, cultures and religions.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nThese are values accepted universally and which form the\r\nbedrock of the culture of peace.\r\nThe culture of peace aims at empowering people. It\r\ncontributes to overcoming authoritarian structures and\r\nexploitation through democratic participation. It works\r\nagainst poverty and inequalities and promotes development.\r\nIt celebrates diversity, advances understanding and\r\ntolerance, and reduces inequality between man and woman.\r\nIndeed, the development of the concept of the culture\r\nof peace has both theoretical and practical values. It\r\nprovides a conceptual framework that emphasizes the\r\nimportance of addressing the deep cultural roots of war and\r\nviolence and it constitutes the basis of a coherent strategy\r\nfor the culture of peace and non-violence. Bangladesh\r\nbelieves that the draft declaration and programme of action\r\non a culture of peace represent a significant step in the\r\nbuilding of a global United Nations strategy of articulated,\r\nmutually reinforcing actions for the building of the culture\r\nof peace and for the prevention of violence. We welcome\r\nthe texts and wholeheartedly support them.\r\nThe General Assembly, in proclaiming the millennium\r\nyear 2000 the International Year for the Culture of Peace,\r\nhas recognized the value of the culture of peace. The\r\nGeneral Assembly will also be acting later today on the\r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/53/L.25 on the\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nviolence for the Children of the World (2001-2010).\r\nBangladesh, along with a large number of co-sponsoring\r\ncountries, had the honour of initiating the proposal for the\r\nDecade in the Economic and Social Council last July. We\r\ntrust that the draft resolution will be adopted by\r\nwholehearted consensus by the world body, opening the\r\nvista for the culture of peace and non-violence for present\r\nand future generations.\r\nBangladesh is pleased to find in the consolidated\r\nreport information on a wide range of activities relating to\r\na culture of peace undertaken by the United Nations\r\nsystem, in particular by the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), in various\r\nparts of the world. The involvement of civil society in these\r\nactivities is very crucial. The challenge of promoting a\r\nculture of peace is so broad and far-reaching that it can be\r\nmet only if it becomes a priority for the entire United\r\nNations system. What better action can the United Nations\r\ntake to realize the objectives of its Charter than the\r\npromotion of the culture of peace worldwide?\r\nWe are therefore very encouraged by the attention\r\ngiven by the Administrative Committee on Coordination\r\n(ACC) last month to the culture of peace initiative. In\r\ndocument A/53/370/Add.2 it is mentioned that the\r\nexecutive heads of the United Nations agencies agreed\r\nthat the concept of the culture of peace was at the heart\r\nof the United Nations system. We also welcome the\r\ndecision of the ACC to launch the International Year for\r\nthe Culture of Peace at all United Nations system\r\nheadquarters and field offices on the International Day of\r\nPeace in 1999. We commend Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan for his forward-looking support for the culture of\r\npeace initiative. Bangladesh, along with many other\r\ncountries, also pays tribute to the visionary leadership of\r\nUNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor in this regard\r\nand encourage his greater involvement in the activities\r\nrelating to the culture of peace.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to welcome\r\nthe resolution adopted at the meeting of the UNESCO\r\nExecutive Board on Friday, 6 November 1998, at\r\nTashkent on a culture of peace. The consolidated report\r\nhas identified the varied nature of activities undertaken by\r\ncountries, civil society and international and regional\r\norganizations to promote a culture of peace. A remarkable\r\nexample of such activities is the memorial of the island of\r\nGorée in Senegal, which is a manifestation of tolerance\r\nand non-violence for Africa and its diaspora. The peace\r\nprize named after President Félix Houphouët-Boigny is\r\nalso a noteworthy way of honouring individuals dedicated\r\nto the culture of peace.\r\nWe believe that the draft declaration and programme\r\nof action are well drafted and contain the specific actions\r\nthat will facilitate the promotion of a culture of peace.\r\nThey provide a conceptual framework which can increase\r\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations system in an\r\nintegrated manner in its work for the promotion of a\r\nculture of peace and link these activities to other priority\r\nareas of the United Nations, including those pertaining to\r\ninternational peace and security, democracy, development\r\nand human rights. In this context, Bangladesh believes\r\nthat a culture of peace can be chosen very appropriately\r\nas the overarching theme for the proposed Millennium\r\nAssembly in the year 2000.\r\nWe call for the adoption of the draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action as soon as possible during this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Bangladesh will be\r\ngreatly honoured to present an appropriate draft resolution\r\nfor the consensus adoption of the texts. We will also be\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nhappy to coordinate consultations in this regard, as we did\r\nlast year.\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): At the outset, allow me to express our gratitude\r\nto the Government of Bangladesh for bringing to this forum\r\nthe issue that may define our future, that of a culture of\r\npeace.\r\nOur delegation would like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and the Director-General of\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) for the comprehensive and\r\nsubstantive consolidated report containing a draft\r\ndeclaration and programme of action on a culture of peace.\r\nTurkmenistan fully supports the initiatives contained in the\r\nreport calling upon all Member States to join in\r\ncommemorating the year 2000, the birth of the new\r\nmillennium, as the International Year for the Culture of\r\nPeace.\r\nThe Government of Turkmenistan is co-sponsoring the\r\ndraft resolution on the culture of peace at this session, as it\r\ndid last year. Last summer Turkmenistan co-sponsored the\r\nEconomic and Social Council resolution on the International\r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the\r\nChildren of the World (2001-2010). We hope that\r\ndelegations will also support the adoption of the present\r\ndraft resolution by consensus at the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nA need for lasting peace prompted the creation of the\r\nUnited Nations more than 53 years ago. From the day of its\r\nfounding until now peace has remained the first and most\r\nimportant commandment embodied in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. A culture of peace is a comprehensive\r\ncomplex of values based on the right to peace, which is\r\nvital and inseparable from any other basic human rights,\r\nsuch as the rights to life, security, freedom and\r\ndevelopment, women’s rights and children’s rights. We\r\nbelieve that peace can be built only by sharing\r\nresponsibility and engaging in dialogue in an effort to ban\r\nviolence, hatred and the use of military power. Peace can\r\nbe guaranteed if it is based on the values and principles of\r\nfreedom, justice, democracy, respect for all human rights,\r\ntolerance and the recognition of diversity.\r\nThe notion of learning to live together is not a new\r\none, and the threads and routes that linked cultures and\r\ncivilizations can be found throughout human history. In our\r\npart of the world one of the longest bridges of multicultural\r\ncommunication was the Silk Road, which linked almost\r\nevery civilization of Asia to Europe. The caravans carried\r\nnot only the material treasures of those cultures, but also\r\ntheir splendid jewels of human thought, including books\r\nof wisdom and masterpieces of our cultural heritage. We\r\nare very pleased that UNESCO included the name of the\r\ngreat Turkmen thinker and poet Magtymguly in the list of\r\nthose cultural treasures.\r\nWe commend UNESCO’s work in providing\r\nassistance to several projects of the Integral Study of the\r\nSilk Road, in organizing international expeditions and\r\ncolloquiums, launching international research programmes\r\nand institutes, in promoting cultural tourism and in\r\nproducing studies, films, and publications, including a\r\nhistory book on the civilizations of Central Asia. Today,\r\nour countries are promoting the renaissance of those\r\nforgotten trails of the Silk Road by strengthening\r\neconomic and cultural cooperation.\r\nTurkmenistan believes that strong economic\r\ncooperation can help achieve a better peace. The only\r\nway to realize all the benefits of peace is by respecting\r\ninternational obligations and mutually agreed upon legal\r\ninstruments and to recognize that the maintenance of\r\npeace is interdependent with other factors. In this regard,\r\nTurkmenistan has expressed the need to ensure the\r\nsecurity and unimpeded transit of natural resources\r\nthrough pipelines. These pipelines, like another Silk Road,\r\nhave become the main arteries of the region and are vital\r\nfor its development.\r\nTurkmenistan supports the revised UNESCO\r\ntransdisciplinary project entitled “Towards a culture of\r\npeace”. A culture of peace will not become a reality\r\nunless it is supported by individuals, civil societies,\r\nGovernments and, most importantly, the leadership of\r\nnations. Mr. Oscar Arias, a Nobel Peace laureate and\r\nformer President of Costa Rica, said that\r\n“our leaders must be willing to dedicate themselves\r\nto peace and education. Our creativity, our sense of\r\njustice and our humanity must be our weapons.”\r\nPeace-building and peacemaking programmes should\r\nutilize all available resources of the United Nations,\r\nincluding human rights instruments, established\r\nmechanisms for conflict resolution, programmes and\r\nstudies of UNESCO, the United Nations University and\r\nits International Leadership Academy and the good\r\nservices of United Nations Volunteers and United Nations\r\nGoodwill Ambassadors.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nIt should be universally accepted that throughout the\r\ncourse of the entire educational process educational\r\ninstitutions must instil in young women and men the values\r\nof life and peace, as well as the principles of social\r\ncoexistence, human solidarity and respect for diversity. We\r\nshould teach our young people to temper their ambitions\r\nwith compassion and tolerance so that we can create a new\r\ngeneration in keeping with the tradition of Mohandas\r\nGandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Then we may continue\r\nto entertain the hope of President Nelson Mandela, who\r\nenvisioned a world in which a newly emerged cadre of\r\nleaders would not allow anyone to be denied freedom,\r\nturned into a refugee, condemned to go hungry or stripped\r\nof human dignity. Otherwise, irresponsibility and ignorance\r\nwill continue to lead to hatred and violence, social injustice,\r\nthe expansion of global inequality and rising levels of\r\npoverty in places where people may never know peace and\r\ndemocracy but only war and genocide. This is why the\r\nconcept and practical implementation of a culture of peace\r\nare very important for coming generations. In this regard,\r\nTurkmenistan supports the idea that the culture of peace\r\nshould become a central theme of the Millennium\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to quote the late United\r\nStates Senator J. William Fulbright, who once said that\r\n“our future is not in the stars but in our own minds\r\nand hearts. Creative leadership and liberal education,\r\nwhich in fact go together, are the first requirements\r\nfor a hopeful future for humankind.”\r\nMr. Izquierdo (Ecuador) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Now is the moment for peace. At the close of the\r\nmillennium, the entire world is clamouring for a lasting\r\npeace that leaves no room for war. In order to achieve this,\r\nwe need to move towards a culture of peace, tolerance and\r\nsolidarity based on the fundamental principles of human\r\nrights, democracy, freedom and social justice.\r\nWe must begin with an education based on ethical,\r\npluralist, democratic, humanist and scientific principles, an\r\neducation that promotes respect for human rights, develops\r\ncritical thinking, provides the necessary skills for efficiency\r\nin work and production and encourages creativity and the\r\nfull development of the personality and special skills of\r\neach individual. As a result, we will have human beings\r\nwho are united, tolerant, peace-loving and prepared to\r\nresolve their conflicts by means other than the use of force\r\nand violence.\r\nThe link between peace, education and respect for\r\nhuman rights is essential, and in this respect we are\r\npleased to see how the concept of the right to peace is\r\ngaining strength. It suffices to cite the examples contained\r\nin the report of the Secretary-General entitled\r\n“Consolidated report containing a draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action on a culture of peace” (A/53/370),\r\nin particular its references to the meeting of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, held last April in Windhoek,\r\nNamibia, and to the General Assembly of the\r\nOrganization of American States, in which the concept of\r\nthe human right to peace was discussed.\r\nThree years ago, in this same Hall, in the framework\r\nof the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, a group of Latin American countries, supported\r\nby a large number of delegations, took the fine initiative\r\nof welcoming resolution 5.3, adopted by the General\r\nConference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and under which\r\nthe Director-General of UNESCO was invited to direct\r\nthe activities of the transdisciplinary project entitled\r\n“Towards a culture of peace”. They asked the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to report on the educational activities conducted\r\nwithin the framework of that project. In 1996, after\r\nstudying the report and taking into account the importance\r\nof all the activities thus far carried out for the culture of\r\npeace, they requested a report that would include elements\r\nof a provisional draft declaration and programme of\r\naction on a culture of peace.\r\nA year ago, in the report of the Secretary-General\r\ncontained in document A/52/292, we received the\r\nelements of that provisional draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action. Today, the General Assembly has\r\nbefore it a concrete proposal, included in the report\r\ncontained in document A/53/370 to which I have already\r\nreferred. We therefore believe that the time has now come\r\nto turn concepts into proposals for action, to move from\r\nwords to daily practice. Let us recall that together we\r\ndecided to proclaim the year 2000 as the International\r\nYear for the Culture of Peace. What better time could\r\nthere be to adopt a long-term programme of action that\r\nwill contribute to the building of the world to which we\r\naspire in the next millennium?\r\nEcuador wishes to take this opportunity to reiterate\r\nits commitment to work actively towards finding the\r\nmechanism that will make it possible for us to adopt a\r\ndraft declaration and programme of action on a culture of\r\npeace. We believe that a declaration and programme of\r\naction of such importance needs the support of all, and\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nfor that reason we appeal to the international community to\r\ntake a stand on this subject. The Non-Aligned Movement\r\nalready did this just a few months ago in Durban, when our\r\nheads of State or Government welcomed the adoption of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 52/13 and urged the\r\npromotion of a culture of peace based on the principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter and on respect for human rights,\r\ndemocracy and tolerance; the promotion of development\r\nand education for peace; the rejection of racism, racial\r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and foreign occupation; the free\r\nflow of information; the broad participation of women as an\r\nintegral way of avoiding violence and conflicts; as well as\r\non efforts aimed at creating conditions conducive to peace\r\nand its consolidation.\r\nLastly, I would like to recall that the Government of\r\nEcuador co-sponsored the draft resolution entitled\r\n“International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nviolence for the Children of the World (2001-2010)”,\r\nadopted at the substantive session of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, now contained in document A/53/L.25,\r\nwhich we recommend that the Assembly adopt today. It is\r\nin our hands to prepare the world of the future, the world\r\nof our children.\r\nMr. Xie Bohua (China) (interpretation from Chinese):\r\nSince the end of the cold war, the General Assembly and\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) have engaged in useful\r\ndiscussions on the relationship between peace and war and\r\nbetween peace and culture, and have advanced the\r\nimportant concept of a transition from a culture of war to\r\na culture of peace, whose most important elements include,\r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,\r\nelimination of poverty, emphasis on education, the\r\nadvancement of the status of women and the promotion of\r\nmutual understanding and tolerance among all peoples.\r\nWe are pleased to note that, in accordance with the\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution adopted last December, the\r\nSecretary-General, in coordination with the Director-\r\nGeneral of UNESCO, has submitted to the current session\r\na consolidated report containing a draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action on a culture of peace. This report is\r\nthe result of the joint efforts of the world’s Governments\r\nand peoples. It reflects the ardent aspiration of the peoples\r\nof the world to maintain peace, end war, respect human\r\nrights and promote development. The Chinese Government\r\nexpresses its appreciation for the submission of this report.\r\nThe Chinese are a peace-loving people. Over 2,000\r\nyears ago, the great thinkers of China expressed their\r\naspirations for a world of great harmony, in which there\r\nwould be no war and people would live together in\r\nharmony. They put forward the idea that goodwill and\r\nfriendly neighbourly relations were a national treasure,\r\nand expressed their love of peace and their opposition to\r\nconflict and war. Those ideas have become ingrained in\r\nall aspects of traditional Chinese culture and have become\r\nguiding principles for dealing with relations among\r\nChinese ethnic groups and between China and other\r\ncountries. Today, all the ethnic groups of China are united\r\nand live in harmony; at the same time, China is seeking\r\nto establish and develop friendly cooperative relations\r\nwith the people of other countries on the basis of mutual\r\nrespect and peaceful coexistence.\r\nPeace and development are indivisible. Without\r\npeace and stability, economic and social development will\r\nhave no basis on which to proceed; and without economic\r\nand social development, peace and stability will be\r\ndifficult to consolidate and sustain. The Chinese\r\nGovernment has always believed that in order to realize\r\nthe main objective of peace and development, the\r\ninternational community should make joint efforts to\r\nestablish a just and reasonable new international political\r\nand economic order on the basis of the United Nations\r\nCharter and the five principles of peaceful coexistence.\r\nThere should be no resort to the threat or use of force or\r\nto the indiscriminate use of sanctions to resolve\r\ndifferences and disputes among countries. Solutions\r\nshould be sought by peaceful means, through dialogue\r\ninstead of confrontation.\r\nAs pointed out in the draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action, a culture of peace is a process of\r\nindividual, collective and institutional transformation. It\r\ngrows out of the beliefs and actions of the people\r\nthemselves and develops and evolves in each country\r\nwithin its specific historical, sociocultural and economic\r\ncontext. Therefore, we believe that the culture of peace is\r\nnot a rigid concept; it is a multifaceted concept rich in\r\nmeaning. If it is to promote a culture of peace, the\r\ninternational community should pay full attention to the\r\ndiversity of the world and respect the different approaches\r\nand means adopted by each country according to its\r\nnational conditions. Only in that way will it be possible\r\ntruly to realize the objectives and the essence of the\r\nculture of peace.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): The creation of the United\r\nNations was a conceptual watershed in the history of\r\nhumankind. With that momentous step, we turned our\r\nback on the culture of war and violence. At the same\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\ntime, we together pledged to practise tolerance and live\r\ntogether in peace. However, in the years that followed, we\r\nwitnessed violence in various guises and, to our dismay, we\r\nwere not able to effect a transformation from a culture of\r\nwar and violence to a culture of peace. It was only in 1989\r\nthat the concept of the culture of peace was revived and\r\nbegan to seriously preoccupy us. As a result of the efforts\r\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) to promote the concept at many\r\nlevels and in many countries, it has become a global\r\nmovement.\r\nHaving addressed the concept in the General Assembly\r\nat its last three sessions, we were able to adopt resolution\r\n52/13 last year. Pursuant to that resolution, we now have\r\nbefore us the consolidated report containing a draft\r\ndeclaration and programme of action. In this regard, I wish\r\nto express to the Secretary-General and to the Director-\r\nGeneral of UNESCO our thanks for the submission of the\r\nreport contained in document A/53/370. As we are all\r\naware, the draft declaration and programme of action\r\nsubmitted in the report are the end result of the efforts we\r\nhave made over the years to lay the foundation for the\r\nestablishment of a culture of peace. We are convinced that\r\nthese two documents, based on the ideas accumulated in the\r\nprocess and strengthened by the proposals and suggestions\r\nsubmitted not only by various United Nations entities and\r\nother international organizations but by Member States as\r\nwell, represent a solid basis for the achievement of our\r\nlofty aim. With the declaration and programme of action\r\navailable to us now, we are hopeful that the\r\nintergovernmental process of examining them can be\r\ncompleted in time for the observance of the International\r\nYear for the Culture of Peace in the year 2000.\r\nThe establishment of a culture of peace is bound to be\r\na long-term process of gradual transformation, addressing\r\nthe roots of violence so firmly embedded and ossified in\r\nour minds. As history has clearly shown, transforming a\r\nculture of violence and war has proved to be difficult and\r\nsometimes even frustrating. The deaths of millions of\r\npeople in wars and numerous other conflicts after the\r\nSecond World War are eloquent testimony to that fact. If\r\nhistory and the current tragic developments unfolding in\r\nvarious parts of the world are any guide to us, we can\r\neasily foresee many obstacles in our future efforts for a\r\nculture of peace. We believe that it is with the conscious\r\nand active involvement of all concerned that we will be\r\nable to overcome future obstacles. We therefore consider it\r\nmost appropriate that the declaration adopt a comprehensive\r\napproach involving all the main actors. We also believe that\r\nthe primacy given to the role of a wide range of actors\r\nwhose actions have a direct impact on the mind is a\r\ncorrect approach that will greatly contribute to the success\r\nof our task.\r\nLast year, my delegation stated from this rostrum\r\nthat the firm establishment of a culture of peace at the\r\nnational level would determine the success of our\r\nendeavours at the global level. In this respect, the\r\ndeclaration has rightly acknowledged the essential role of\r\nthe State in establishing and consolidating the necessary\r\nconditions for the development of the concept. We are\r\nalso pleased that the declaration recognizes the\r\nimportance of the specific historical, sociocultural and\r\neconomic context of a country in nurturing a culture of\r\npeace. Myanmar is fully aware of the powerful influence\r\nof the specific conditions of a country on the formation of\r\na particular culture.\r\nThe importance of education in our undertaking\r\ncannot be overemphasized. There has been a consensus\r\non the key role of education in the new directions that\r\ntoday’s world is taking. It has been generally accepted\r\nthat investment in education amounts to investment in\r\npeace and progress. The task of constructing a culture of\r\npeace requires, first and foremost, disarming hatred and\r\ntaming violence in their early stages. Education is the best\r\ntool in this regard, since it provides all the opportunities\r\nto do so. Education provides opportunities for much\r\ninteraction and for engaging in a long learning process,\r\nwhich are the most propitious factors for strengthening\r\nthe sense of belonging and togetherness. As a result, it\r\ninstils tolerance in the mind and contributes to the\r\nrejection of violence in all its manifestations. If\r\neffectively implemented, a thoroughly formulated and\r\ncarefully tailored education policy may instil in children,\r\nin their formative years, values, attitudes and behaviours\r\nwhich will promote a culture of peace. We believe that\r\nthis will ensure a future free from all forms of violence.\r\nFor these reasons, it is gratifying to note that the\r\ndeclaration urges us to mobilize every aspect of education\r\ntowards the goal of building a culture of peace. In our\r\ndelegation’s view, the draft declaration in its present form\r\nis correct in its thrust and approach.\r\nI also wish to take this opportunity to make some\r\ncomments on the draft programme of action. We need a\r\nprogramme of action with a sound basis to achieve the\r\naims of a culture of peace. As it is presented in the\r\nreport, the draft programme fulfils this need. Considering\r\nthe importance of national efforts for the success of\r\nglobal endeavours, complementarity between national\r\nstrategies for action and the overall strategy is vitally\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nimportant. It is therefore a sound approach for the draft\r\nprogramme to encourage the establishment of national\r\nstrategies that would be complementary to the draft\r\nprogramme before us.\r\nConcerning the specific actions proposed in the draft\r\nprogramme, we believe that these will provide valuable\r\nguidance to Member States in working out appropriate\r\nnational strategies. We feel sure that complementarity of the\r\nstrategies at all levels will increase synergy in our activities\r\nand coherence in our approach. As suggested in the draft\r\nprogramme, it is crucially important to mobilize all\r\navailable resources for the programme’s success. Although\r\nwe believe that the comprehensive strategy yet to be\r\nformulated will include ways and means of finding\r\nresources for the programme, it is equally important to have\r\nthe necessary fundamental resources available well before\r\nwe fully embark on the programme. In this respect, solid\r\nand timely financial support for the programme is of vital\r\nimportance for its implementation. We are convinced that\r\nthe envisaged comprehensive strategy for the programme\r\nwill ensure the adequacy and predictability of the funding.\r\nWe feel certain that the monitoring system of the\r\ncomprehensive strategy will also look after the funding\r\naspect of the programme.\r\nAs a country where peace of mind is one of the most\r\nimportant aims in the life of almost every individual and\r\nwhere tolerance is one of the most important and most\r\ncarefully nurtured and practised character traits of everyone,\r\nMyanmar was among the sponsors of General Assembly\r\nresolution 52/15, entitled “Proclamation of the year 2000 as\r\nthe International Year for the Culture of Peace”. We\r\ntherefore could not agree more with the objective of the\r\ndraft programme to take advantage of the International Year\r\nfor the Culture of Peace in the year 2000 as the appropriate\r\noccasion to launch the initiative it sets out. Nothing could\r\nbe more auspicious than ushering in a new millennium with\r\na peace programme.\r\nFinally, the multifaceted task of constructing a culture\r\nof peace requires comprehensive action on all fronts,\r\naddressing all ages and all groups. It is incumbent on all of\r\nus to concert and coordinate all our efforts to accomplish\r\nthis monumental undertaking. With the momentum we have\r\ngained thus far and with a road map for the future provided\r\nby the draft declaration and programme of action, we\r\nfervently hope that we will be successful.\r\nMr. Castaneda-Cornejo (El Salvador) (interpretation\r\nfrom Spanish): It my honour to address the Assembly on\r\nbehalf of Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador,\r\nGuatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama on agenda\r\nitem 31, entitled “Culture of peace”. I convey the\r\nappreciation of those delegations to the Secretary-General,\r\nwho, in coordination with the Director-General of the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), has submitted to the Assembly\r\na consolidated report (A/53/370 and Add.1 and Add.2)\r\ncontaining a draft declaration and programme of action on\r\na culture of peace.\r\nFor many centuries people believed that war was\r\ninevitable, and that the settlement of conflicts and\r\ndisputes among peoples could come only through violence\r\nor other equally destructive action linked to violence. This\r\ncontributed to the forming and consolidation of a culture\r\nof war, which in the course of history led to innumerable\r\nacts of barbarism, destruction and death, and which found\r\nits ultimate expression in the Second World War and in\r\nthe conflicts that arose under the bipolar system that\r\nfollowed that war.\r\nWith the creation of the United Nations in 1945, the\r\ninternational community embarked on an experiment that\r\nover time would radically change the idea that wars were\r\ninevitable: from the moment of its foundation, the new\r\ninternational Organization, based on universally shared\r\nvalues and purposes, defined its principal task as being\r\n“to preserve succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar”. The Organization itself was thus an act of a culture\r\nof peace.\r\nAs the Secretary-General says in the report on a\r\nculture of peace,\r\n“The transition from the culture of war to a\r\nculture of peace, initially taken up as a priority by\r\nUNESCO, has now been taken up by the United\r\nNations as well.” (A/53/370, annex, para. 3)\r\nRecognition of this priority by the United Nations system\r\nopens the door on a new era for mankind in which we are\r\nconfident that the conclusion will be drawn that violence,\r\nin any of its manifestations, can be avoided.\r\nThe Central American countries and the Dominican\r\nRepublic share the view that the essence of a culture of\r\npeace approach is that rather than intervening in violent\r\nconflicts after they have erupted and then engaging in\r\npost-conflict peace-building, it is more humane and more\r\nefficient to prevent such violence in the first place by\r\naddressing its roots. Many of our peoples in the Central\r\nAmerican region had to learn this approach in a painful\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nway, as a direct or indirect result of profound social,\r\neconomic, political and ideological conflicts that for more\r\nthan a decade put us on the path of violence and\r\nintolerance, confrontation and the culture of war.\r\nWith the peace that arrived thanks to the spirit that\r\ngave rise to the Esquipulas, Chapultepec and Guatemala\r\nagreements, we in Central America aspire to a democratic\r\nand equitable region whose development is based on a\r\nprocess of progressive improvement in quality of life\r\nthrough economic growth with social equity, and the\r\ntransformation of methods of production and patterns of\r\nconsumption based on ecological balance as a vital support\r\nfor the region. We hold that aspiration in spite of the\r\nobstacles and difficulties that have been magnified by the\r\nirreparable effects of hurricane Mitch in our region:\r\nproperty destroyed, thousands of lives loss and some 2\r\nmillion people injured.\r\nThe vision of a region united in peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development, a vision shared also by the\r\nDominican Republic, is what makes it possible for our\r\nGovernments to reiterate their resolute support for the draft\r\ndeclaration and programme of action on a culture of peace\r\npresented by the Secretary-General in coordination with the\r\nDirector-General of UNESCO in the document before us,\r\nwhich we hope will be adopted by consensus at this\r\nsession.\r\nThe considered aspects set out in the declaration on a\r\nculture of peace correspond to and complement the efforts\r\nof the international community to promote and universally\r\napply all human rights — especially during this year when\r\nwe are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the fifth\r\nanniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction — because, in our opinion, there is an undeniable\r\nand unequivocal link between peace and respect for all\r\nhuman rights.\r\nWe agree that a culture of peace is a process of\r\nindividual, collective and institutional transformation which\r\narises out of the beliefs and actions of individuals\r\nthemselves and which evolves within each country in a\r\ngiven historical, socio-cultural and economic context. In this\r\nrespect, the role played by the State to ensure respect for\r\nand promotion and protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms is essential and must take place in\r\nclose collaboration and cooperation with all members of\r\ncivil society in order to truly create the conditions that\r\nallow for the development of a culture of peace.\r\nFurthermore, we agree that education is the\r\nfundamental means to build a culture of peace. It is for\r\nthis reason that we value highly the efforts made for\r\npeace by the Governments of the American continent\r\nthrough the adoption of the Program of Education for\r\nPeace in the Hemisphere by the General Assembly of the\r\nOrganization of American States on 3 June 1998. We also\r\nvalue the efforts made by the General Assembly of the\r\nUnited Nations in the framework of the United Nations\r\nDecade for Human Rights Education, 1995-2004, and the\r\nactions that will be carried out on the occasion of the\r\ncommemoration of the year 2000 as the International\r\nYear for the Culture of Peace.\r\nIn connection with the programme of action, our\r\nGovernments believe that there exist enough elements for\r\nbroad-ranging and profound reflection in each of our\r\ncountries that would allow us to prepare a national\r\nprogramme of action to promote the implementation of\r\nthe proposals made by the Secretary-General in his report\r\nin accordance with our needs and economic and socio-\r\ncultural conditions.\r\nLikewise, we believe that there is agreement between\r\nthe objectives and strategies of the programme of action\r\non a culture of peace and the concrete measures that can\r\nbe adopted at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels to promote the consolidation and integration of this\r\neffort with the gains and achievements made by the\r\nMember States of the United Nations in connection with\r\nthe application of the results of global conferences,\r\nparticularly those held since 1982. That agreement\r\nillustrates the importance that the United Nations system\r\nattaches to the mobilization of international public opinion\r\nfor a culture of peace for the new millennium.\r\nI would like to reiterate the commitment and\r\npolitical will of the Governments of the Central American\r\ncountries and the Dominican Republic to disseminate and\r\npromote the values, attitudes and behaviours that are\r\nnecessary to build a culture of peace that is strengthened\r\nby the successes and challenges confronting our peoples\r\nand Governments in the implementation of various\r\nprogrammes on a culture of peace that have been\r\nconducted in the region for some years now. We also\r\nwant to reiterate our support for the draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action on a culture of peace presented by\r\nthe Secretary-General. We agree with him that the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace in the year\r\n2000 can be an opportunity to put into practice the\r\ninitiatives of the programme of action and to help\r\nmotivate international public opinion in favour of a\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\npermanent culture of peace in the minds and the hearts of\r\nall humanity.\r\nMrs. de Barish (Costa Rica) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): My delegation associates itself with the important\r\nstatement made in connection with agenda item 31, entitled\r\n“Culture of peace”, by the Permanent Representative of El\r\nSalvador, Ambassador Ricardo Cornejo, on behalf of\r\nGuatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican\r\nRepublic and my country, Costa Rica.\r\nThe delegation of Costa Rica is convinced of the need\r\nfor and the importance of promoting a culture of peace in\r\norder to achieve profound change — to replace the culture\r\nof war and violence with the culture of peace and non-\r\nviolence. This will be the challenge of the new millennium.\r\nOur calling to peace has been demonstrated throughout the\r\nyears through a number of proposals, such as the\r\nestablishment of the University for Peace in 1980. The\r\nobjectives and activities of the University have included and\r\nwill continue to include cooperation with the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) in an effort to establish a culture of peace in\r\nthe world through the irreplaceable means of education and\r\npublicity.\r\nSubsequently, my Government proposed the\r\nproclamation of 1986 as the International Year of Peace\r\nand, at the same time, the International Day of Peace to\r\ncoincide annually with the opening day of the General\r\nAssembly session. Lastly, it called for the proclamation of\r\nthe World Week of Peace during the celebration of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, from 24 to 30\r\nOctober 1995. In this connection, the representative of\r\nTurkmenistan referred just moments ago in her statement to\r\nthe former President of Costa Rica, Mr. Oscar Arias, who\r\nwas awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nWe thank Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury of\r\nBangladesh for introducing this important item so\r\neloquently.\r\nMy delegation also appreciates the presentation by the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the Director-\r\nGeneral of UNESCO of the excellent consolidated report\r\ncontained in document A/53/370, which was submitted to\r\nus in accordance with resolution 52/13, adopted on 20\r\nNovember 1997 with 71 co-sponsors, including my own\r\ndelegation.\r\nThis report contains the draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action on a culture of peace. We believe that\r\nthese texts were prepared in a meticulous and detailed\r\nway, as we can see from pages 5 to 14, and that they\r\nreflect what has been said in this connection in past years.\r\nThey contain definitions and concepts of the culture of\r\npeace, as well as the direction that future action should\r\ntake in the United Nations system and in the international\r\ncommunity. We look forward with great interest to the\r\nadoption of both the draft declaration and the draft\r\nprogramme of action as soon as possible, so that we can\r\nenter the new millennium with that vision of a culture of\r\npeace. It is obvious that peoples throughout the world are\r\nseeking a vision of a better world, which could take the\r\nform of a culture of peace as conceived in various\r\nresolutions of the United Nations and as is reflected in the\r\ndraft declaration and programme of action.\r\nMy delegation believes that this should be the theme\r\nof the millennium. With the end of the cold war, the\r\nUnited Nations now has the opportunity to fulfil one of\r\nits fundamental and primary objectives: that of abolishing\r\nwar. This clearly requires a profound transformation of\r\nthe cultural roots of war and violence in the transition to\r\na culture of peace and non-violence.\r\nAs is described in the introduction — pages 4\r\nand 5 — of the document we are considering, this\r\nobjective is part of the very history of the United Nations\r\nand its partners and has been recognized by the General\r\nAssembly as a priority in its designation of the year 2000\r\nas the International Year for the Culture of Peace. We\r\nrecognize that the culture of peace is a necessary\r\nprecondition for national and international peace and\r\nsecurity. It complements preventive diplomacy,\r\npeacekeeping, disarmament and military conversion.\r\nIt is not enough to send peacekeeping forces to\r\nseparate parties that are at war or to undertake post-\r\nconflict peace-building, nor does preventive diplomacy\r\nseem to suffice. We must also act at a deeper level. The\r\ndevelopment of a culture of peace can provide a secure\r\nbasis for the achievement of disarmament and military\r\nconversion, and it can meet concerns for human security.\r\nThe transition to a culture of peace requires the\r\nparticipation of individuals, of communities and of\r\ninstitutions at all levels. It requires the development of a\r\nglobal movement so that the United Nations can provide\r\ninspiration and leadership. The International Year for the\r\nCulture of Peace, 2000, offers an opportunity for the\r\nmobilization of that global movement, which will include\r\neducators; journalists; parliamentarians; religious\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\ncommunities; organizations for women, youth and the\r\nelderly; civil society and non-governmental organizations.\r\nIt is important to emphasize the relationship between\r\nthe culture of peace and the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. Respect for and defence of all human,\r\npolitical and civil, social, cultural and economic rights is\r\nessential for a culture of peace. In marking this year the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Declaration, it is necessary and\r\nimportant for the international community to reaffirm its\r\nfull commitment to the establishment of all human rights.\r\nThere is nothing more destructive to human rights than\r\nthe culture of war and violence. Therefore, the promotion\r\nof the culture of peace should be understood as one of the\r\nmost significant milestones in the implementation of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nFinally, the Director-General of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Federico\r\nMayor, has stated that the right to peace is a human right.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the idea of a culture of\r\npeace will be the positive and basic vision with which we\r\nenter the new millennium. Costa Rica, as a sponsor of the\r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/53/L.25, which\r\nwas recommended by the Economic and Social Council at\r\nits recent meeting, would be very pleased indeed to see this\r\ndraft resolution adopted by consensus in the Assembly.\r\nMr. Najem (Lebanon) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nThe General Assembly is once again considering the item\r\n“Culture of peace”, thus providing all States with the\r\nopportunity to put forward their views and ideas on the\r\nmeaning of a culture of peace.\r\nLebanon has always been the cradle of peace and\r\ndisseminated its values and culture. Hence we would like\r\nto enrich the debates of the General Assembly with a\r\ncontribution that may clarify certain dimensions of the\r\nissues that we think should be included in the documents to\r\nbe issued on the culture of peace.\r\nIt expresses the desire for knowledge and the longing\r\nfor a feeling of security. A civilization based on the culture\r\nof peace should oppose all aspects of ignorance, oppression\r\nand backwardness. It should not condone hunger, poverty,\r\ndisplacement or foreign occupation, for such scourges have\r\ngrave implications for the international community and\r\njeopardize international peace and security.\r\nThe culture of peace certainly opposes the culture of\r\nwar. Therefore it can never condone the consequences to\r\nhuman society of the culture of war. I should like to\r\nemphasize the need not to hasten to deal with the culture\r\nof peace as if the world today were free of war or of its\r\ncauses. Human history has seen many cultures and\r\ncivilizations decline because no one defended them\r\nagainst the enemies of peace.\r\nThe culture of peace is a legitimate vision of the\r\nfuture and of the twenty-first century. If the essence of\r\nthe culture of peace is intervention to prevent armed\r\nconflicts, then the international community, as represented\r\nin the United Nations, the forum for peace, is called upon\r\nto bring pressure to bear on the Israeli troops to observe\r\nthe principles and the culture of peace. Israel must be\r\ncompelled to desist from its aggressive policy against\r\nsouthern Lebanon and the western Bekaa Valley, occupied\r\nsince 1978. Israel rejects the implementation of the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 425 (1978),\r\nwhich stipulate its immediate and unconditional\r\nwithdrawal from southern Lebanon.\r\nThis policy, which arrogantly and intransigently\r\nrefuses to implement the resolutions of the United\r\nNations, is inimical to the culture of peace, which we all\r\ncall for its dissemination among our people in order that\r\nthey may live in peace. Is not the obsessive mentality of\r\nwar prevailing in Israel reflected in the daily\r\nbombardment by weapons of all types of the civilian\r\npopulation in southern Lebanon? Is that not inimical to\r\nthe culture of peace? The premeditated acts of aggression\r\non the part of the Israeli occupation troops against the\r\nheadquarters of the United Nations in Qana in southern\r\nLebanon — the envoys of peace in the area — in April\r\n1996 and the murder of 106 innocent women, children\r\nand elderly people, are these not acts that contravene the\r\nculture of peace?\r\nFurthermore, what can we say when we see Israel,\r\nwhich claims to want to implement resolution 425 (1973)\r\nwhich stipulates Israel’s immediate and unconditional\r\nwithdrawal from Lebanon, steal Lebanese soil and\r\ntransfer it to Israel. Israel has admitted this. In this\r\ncontext, the Arabs, who have made peace an integral part\r\nof their civilization, legacy and daily conduct, as well as\r\na deeply rooted element of their lives and customs, see\r\nthe natural role of the United Nations and its various\r\nagencies as being to uphold and disseminate vigorously\r\nthe values of peace. Hence, the Arabs have accepted the\r\nUnited Nations concept for achieving peace in the Middle\r\nEast on the basis of land for peace, as well as Security\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nOn the other hand, the Israeli Government is sparing no\r\neffort to provoke new aggressive wars and to possess\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nHere we are faced with two different cultures:\r\nhumane, national culture — the culture of peace — versus\r\nthe culture of domination and aggression as represented by\r\nthe politics of the Israeli occupation forces. Our\r\napprehension here is that culture itself would become an\r\narena for sparking wars among peoples and states, instead\r\nof becoming the culture of peace that we all desire.\r\nWe regard the diversity of cultures in the world as a\r\npositive factor that enriches the culture of peace, which\r\nshould be the sum total of all these cultures. In this respect\r\nthere is no room for engaging in the whirlpool of imposing\r\nthe cultures of certain countries and peoples at the expense\r\nof the cultures and customs of other peoples. Human rights\r\nare an expression of tolerance in all cultures. That is the\r\nfoundation for peace and progress. Human rights — if\r\nunderstood properly, interpreted in a just manner, and\r\nimplemented without double standards — are not alien to\r\nany culture, but part and parcel of the sum culture of all\r\nnations.\r\nNonetheless, the bitter reality confronting us in many\r\nparts of the world is that many attempts are being made to\r\ndistort these facts by disregarding the massive violations of\r\nhuman rights as well as the values of the culture of peace.\r\nWhile there is disregard of the right to self-determination of\r\nthe millions of Palestinians and of the hundreds of\r\nthousands of others that have been displaced by the Israeli\r\noccupying forces in southern Lebanon and the Syrian\r\nGolan, we discern no decisive and requisite movement on\r\nthe part of some of those defenders of the culture of peace\r\nand human rights to compel the Israeli occupying forces to\r\nwithdraw from the occupied Arab territories, to observe and\r\nimplement the relevant United Nations resolutions with a\r\nview to giving a chance to a just peace and to its culture so\r\nthat they may be deeply embedded in the conscience and in\r\nthe daily life of all peoples.\r\nLebanon, the inheritor of 6,000 years of civilization,\r\nis looking forward today to a world free from occupation\r\nand hegemony, a world in which the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations prevail — the principles of justice, equality\r\nand peace.\r\nMr. Yacoubou (Benin) (interpretation from French):\r\nThe inclusion on the agenda of item 31, entitled “Culture\r\nof peace”, gives me once again the opportunity of taking\r\nthe floor before the Assembly in order to share with it the\r\nspecial interest that my country, Benin, has in peace\r\nthroughout the world and, above all, in the need to\r\nsafeguard this peace by the step-by-step and effective\r\nestablishment of a culture of peace.\r\nFollowing the example of other delegations, the\r\ndelegation of Benin would like to commend and thank\r\nmost warmly the Secretary-General and the Director-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), not only for the very\r\nuseful documents made available to us, but also and\r\nabove all for their tireless efforts to heighten the\r\ninternational community’s awareness of this universal\r\nvalue — peace — and to plant in minds the seeds of such\r\na culture, which is so essential if we are to deal with the\r\nmany challenges confronting humankind.\r\nWith the end of that long-dreaded phenomenon, the\r\ncold war, the international community heaved a sigh of\r\nrelief because it felt that from then on it would be spared\r\nanother world war as large as those that twice so terribly\r\naffected humankind. But we must now recognize that the\r\ncoming of peace remains threatened by the persistence of\r\nunderdevelopment and, above all, by the resurgence of the\r\ndoctrines and ideologies of racism, xenophobia,\r\nethnocentrism, intolerance and violence that,\r\nunfortunately, underlie the deadly and genocidal conflicts\r\nnow taking place more or less throughout the world, and\r\nespecially in Africa and in Europe.\r\nThus, in order to guarantee a lasting peace, we must\r\nsimultaneously deal with these two categories of\r\neconomic and social factors. Along with our efforts and\r\nactions in the area of development, we should work\r\ntogether to discourage forever the doctrines of violence\r\nand of intolerance and to promote — especially through\r\neducation — a culture of peace in the mind of each and\r\nevery human being, through respect for and protection\r\nand promotion of human rights.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation welcomes the effective\r\nactions undertaken by UNESCO in this area and would\r\nlike to ensure that organization of Benin’s support and\r\nfull cooperation.\r\nThe success of such a noble but difficult a task as\r\nthe culture of peace should not be the prerogative of one\r\nindividual, one State or one international organization. It\r\ndemands the participation of the entire international\r\ncommunity in the implementation, under the aegis of the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nUnited Nations, of a strategy and programme of action\r\nplanned and enacted by all the actors of international life.\r\nThis is why my delegation welcomes the texts\r\nsubmitted to the Assembly: the draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action contained in document A/53/370 and\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.25, entitled “International Decade\r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children\r\nof the World (2001-2010)”. Above and beyond the outline\r\nof the concept of a culture of peace that they provide, these\r\ndrafts contain proposals for strategies and concrete joint\r\nactions to be carried out to promote a genuine culture of\r\npeace and to forever ward off the spectre of war and\r\nconflict.\r\nThe establishment of a culture of peace would enable\r\nour Organization and the entire international community to\r\ndevote their efforts and energies to the solution of many\r\ndevelopment problems, thanks to international security and\r\nthe respect for and defence of human rights that it would\r\ninspire.\r\nIn proclaiming the year 2000 as the International Year\r\nfor the Culture of Peace, the General Assembly did not\r\nwish simply to show its interest in peace; it wished, above\r\nall, to urge the international community to give priority to\r\nthe promotion of a culture of peace in order to safeguard an\r\ninternational society free of violence for current and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nTherefore, Benin supports the proposal that the\r\nprincipal theme for the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly, to be held in the year 2000, be “A culture of\r\npeace”, so that the entire world might become aware of the\r\nneed to safeguard this peace so as to ensure the well-being\r\nof the individual in the next millennium.\r\nIn view of the foregoing, it is up to each and every\r\nState to take here and now the steps required for the\r\nimplementation of the programme of action to be adopted\r\nfollowing our work. Provisions should be especially made\r\nto mark the year 2000, the International Year for the\r\nCulture of Peace, through the implementation of\r\nconsciousness-raising programmes involving\r\nparliamentarians, political parties, teachers and journalists,\r\nin a word, all of civil society.\r\nAs far as Benin is concerned, it has already been\r\nworking, through its democratization process begun in\r\n1990, towards the establishment of a culture of human\r\nrights, a prerequisite for a culture of peace. Political and\r\ncivil rights, the right to be different, and tolerance are all\r\nprecepts which are instilled and experienced daily in\r\nBenin, where it is now taken for granted that respect for\r\nand the protection and promotion of the rights of the\r\nindividual are the requirement sine qua non for the\r\npromotion of a genuine culture of peace.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French):\r\nRacial, ethnic or religious hatred, ignorance, cultural\r\nprejudice, xenophobia, abject poverty, the stifling of\r\npublic liberties — these are all factors which harm\r\npeaceful coexistence among societies.\r\nPeace is not only the absence of war. Racial\r\ndiscrimination, ethnic, religious or political intolerance,\r\nthe failings of democracy and the absence of social\r\ndialogue can also be sources of tension which should be\r\nquelled.\r\nMy delegation believes that as this century fades into\r\nthe dawn of the third millennium, with so many\r\nchallenges giving rise to both hope and concern,\r\nhumankind needs to take stock of its virtues and of its\r\ninexhaustible wealth — wealth represented by the\r\ndialogue among civilizations and cultures. We must\r\nimplement a theory of convergence in order to ensure a\r\ntransition from the reason of force to the force of reason,\r\nto borrow an eloquent expression from the Director-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), Mr. Federico Mayor.\r\nIn the final analysis, the culture of peace implies the\r\nculture of non-violence, with priority being given to\r\ndialogue and negotiation. It also involves a strategy for\r\nconflict-prevention.\r\nToday, all the regions of the world are subject to\r\ndestructive conflicts which are swallowing up enormous\r\nhuman and financial resources which could have, or\r\nshould have, been devoted to the peaceful development of\r\nnations. These continuing conflicts instil in people’s\r\nminds a dangerous culture of violence which no longer\r\neven spares children, women or the elderly. In addition,\r\nmodern means of communication are, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, being used to spread the culture of\r\nviolence, intolerance and xenophobia.\r\nThere is no need to recall that in this quest for the\r\nculture of peace the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize\r\nwas created by UNESCO in 1989. This prize has been\r\nawarded to outstanding personalities: in 1991 to Nelson\r\nMandela, then Vice-President of the African National\r\nCongress, and to President Frederik De Klerk of South\r\nAfrica. In 1993 it was awarded to Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nPeres and Yasser Arafat for strengthening the Middle East\r\npeace process, following the signing of the Washington\r\npeace accords. In 1996 the prize was awarded to Alvaro\r\nArzu, President of the Republic of Guatemala, and to\r\nCommander Rolando Moran, representative of the Unidad\r\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca, for encouraging the\r\npeace process and consolidating the agreement of 29\r\nDecember 1996. Finally, in 1997, the prize was given to\r\nFidel Ramos, then President of the Philippines, and to Nur\r\nMisuari, Chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front,\r\nfor having signed a peace agreement on 2 September 1996,\r\nthus ending a 30-year conflict. The great merit of the\r\nHouphouët-Boigny Prize is that, in the final analysis, it is\r\ndesigned to promote a global vision of the culture of peace\r\nin Africa and throughout the world.\r\nThe Government of Senegal, which has made dialogue\r\none of the constant aspects of its foreign policy, remains\r\ndedicated to the promotion of a culture of peace. My\r\nGovernment, in cooperation with UNESCO, has taken the\r\ninitiative of building a memorial not far from Gorée Island,\r\nfacing the Americas, to remind the world what the slave\r\ntrade was about, as well as to build a bridge designed to\r\nreconcile peoples who should henceforth cultivate\r\nforgiveness and tolerance.\r\nThis is why my country believes that it is of the\r\nutmost importance that we invest in education and the\r\nupbringing of the younger generations with a view to the\r\nuniversality of values and ideas, with a pan-humanist\r\napproach which would safeguard and perpetuate\r\nmoderation, harmony and conciliation among peoples and\r\nnations.\r\nFor these reasons my country became a sponsor of the\r\ndraft resolution submitted to the General Assembly\r\nproclaiming the decade 2001-2010 the International Decade\r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children\r\nof the World — namely, a decade for the children who will\r\nbe responsible for the fate of humankind.\r\nLet us see to it together that we raise the defences of\r\npeace in the spirit of these young generations and that we\r\nensure everywhere respect for and promotion of human\r\nrights — all human rights — be they civil, political, social,\r\ncultural or economic.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights gives us an exceptional opportunity to\r\npromote human rights education in our school systems, as\r\nwell as the culture of tolerance and peace in relations\r\namong States and peoples. To that end, the role of the\r\nUnited Nations is irreplaceable in building a world of\r\ntolerance, peace and love.\r\nMr. Pérez-Otermin (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): For Uruguay, the culture of peace represents a\r\nvital commitment of the international community. We are\r\nby nature a peace-loving country. We understand no other\r\nform of behaviour and coexistence among nations. We\r\ncannot imagine a world in constant conflict. We do not\r\nwant coexistence to be plagued by confrontation and are\r\nnot pleased to see brothers from other cultures destroying\r\nsocieties that they could be building in peace. The time\r\nhas come to settle quarrels begun generations ago. The\r\ntime has come to end discord and to look with optimism\r\nto the future.\r\nThe culture of peace, as opposed to the culture of\r\nconflict, coincides with the end of the cold war.\r\nNevertheless, and paradoxically, since 1989 over 4\r\nmillion people have died as victims of armed conflict,\r\nmost of the them civilians.\r\nAt its last session, the General Assembly, through\r\nresolution 52/15, declared the year 2000 as the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace and at this\r\nsession will implement the programme of action prepared\r\nby the Secretary-General in cooperation with the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO). The United Nations is making progress in\r\nthat direction by emphasizing the promotion of peace\r\namong its Member States. This is consistent with the\r\nfounding idea of the Organization, which was based on\r\navoiding war among nations.\r\nToday, the nature of conflicts has changed. They\r\nhave gone from being international to being mostly\r\ndomestic conflicts that arise largely out of poverty,\r\nignorance, environmental destruction and, inter alia,\r\ndisregard for the basic rights required of a democratic\r\norder. The culture of peace entails a new mission for the\r\ncoming century: to address the roots and causes of war\r\nand violence. This is an integral approach encompassing\r\nrespect for human rights, democracy, tolerance,\r\nsustainable development, education for peace, the free\r\nflow of information and the wider participation of\r\nwomen.\r\nI can assure the Assembly that, in Uruguay,\r\neducational programmes have already incorporated the\r\nconcept of a culture of peace and it is our hope that\r\nfuture generations will fully embrace this view of the\r\nworld. We are particularly pleased to know that, in our\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nregion, guerilla groups are basically laying down their\r\nweapons and taking up enterprises that encompass societies\r\nas a whole. We are especially delighted to see that our\r\nbrothers in Ecuador and Peru have decided to abjure war\r\nand embrace peace. We are pleased that the Presidents of\r\nthe Southern Cone Common Market, and of Bolivia and\r\nChile, declared in Ushuaia, Argentine Republic, that our\r\ncountries constitute a zone of peace.\r\nThe effectiveness of the culture of peace begins with\r\nthe family, the primary and priority nucleus in which the\r\nchild must receive its earliest instruction in that respect,\r\nthen extends to the schools and communities. In this\r\nprogramme, another priority is the participation of the mass\r\nmedia: the oral, written and televised press, along with\r\ncomputers. Their duty and responsibility may not be\r\nemphasized as strongly in the draft programme of action as\r\nwe believe they should have been. The international\r\ncommunity, represented in this General Assembly, must\r\nappeal emphatically to the media to undertake the enormous\r\ntask of inculcating a culture of peace, not a culture of\r\nviolence. That global mobilization must start now.\r\nLet us ensure that the year 2000 will mark the\r\nbeginning of a century devoted to peace, in which nuclear\r\nweapons and all weapons of mass destruction are nothing\r\nbut a nightmare of the past. Let us, with courage and\r\ndetermination, relegate to oblivion the culture of war that\r\nhas dominated the century in which we still live.\r\nMy delegation is pleased with the report submitted by\r\nthe Secretary-General and prepared in cooperation with the\r\nDirector-General of UNESCO. We give our complete\r\nsupport to the draft declaration and programme of action\r\ncontained therein, and we suggest that a culture of peace be\r\nconsidered a principal topic of the Millennium Assembly.\r\nMr. Zmeevski (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): The Russian Federation consistently\r\nadvocates the idea of a culture of peace, which includes\r\nvalues, approaches and universal norms of conduct based\r\non respect for peace, tolerance, fundamental rights and\r\nhuman freedoms. The implementation of the concept of a\r\nculture of peace is a difficult and multifaceted task, the\r\nfulfilment of which, in practice, would entail the ultimate\r\ntransition to a world without war and violence in which the\r\nrule of law and democracy would prevail.\r\nOver the past year, this concept has been further\r\ndeveloped, as reflected in the draft programme of action on\r\na culture of peace contained in the consolidated report\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General in document A/53/370.\r\nIn particular, the draft calls attention to the need for a\r\nuniversal strategy in this field, complemented by the\r\npreparation of strategies at the national level.\r\nIt is precisely in this area that a broad-based project\r\nhas been launched in our country, in cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, called “Year 2000 — A Culture of Peace in\r\nRussia”. Its major objective is to focus and coordinate the\r\nholding of activities in Russia for the International Year\r\nfor the Culture of Peace. In the long run, we aim at\r\npromoting the establishment in Russian society of a stable\r\npsychological trend towards non-violence and tolerance\r\nand the idea of peace as a positive process closely linked\r\nto the protection of human rights, democracy, mutual\r\nunderstanding and solidarity among all peoples and\r\ncultures.\r\nIn preparing the concept of the draft, account was\r\ntaken of the recommendations of the United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development, held in\r\nRio de Janeiro in 1992; the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment, held in Copenhagen in 1995; the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995;\r\nand the International Conference “From the stereotypes of\r\nwar to the ideals of peace through culture and education”,\r\nheld in Moscow in 1997.\r\nThe relevance and the special nature of the project\r\nas carried out in Russia are closely linked to the need for\r\nthe formation of a civil society, the rule of law, the\r\nprevention of ethno-religious and social tensions and the\r\nperformance of tasks for improving the cultural and living\r\nstandards of our people. Furthermore, the culture of peace\r\nis a movement towards the reaffirmation of universal\r\nvalues and a search for answers to the challenges of so-\r\ncalled civilized crises in which we increasingly find\r\nserious phenomena such as alienation and marginalization\r\nof the individual, cultural cruelty and violence and the\r\nspread of various forms of extremism. The “Year 2000 —\r\nA Culture of Peace in Russia” project proceeds from the\r\nconcept of a multifaceted idea of peace, non-violence and\r\ntolerance in the minds of people. A principal way to carry\r\nout this task is through education, including formal\r\neducation in schools and informal education through\r\npublic institutions and mass media.\r\nThe culture of peace is reaffirmed in the process of\r\nmobilizing civil society and enhancing the legal protection\r\nof the population. It will triumph when the importance of\r\npreventing conflicts and eliminating their causes, through\r\ndialogue and negotiation, begins to be understood not just\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nin relation to State structures but in relation to all citizens.\r\nIn practical terms, this will mean the implementation of a\r\nset of specific long-term measures. These include, in\r\nparticular, disseminating public information on the purposes\r\nand the tasks of the International Year for the Culture of\r\nPeace, conducting scientific studies on the culture of peace\r\nand dialogue among civilizations, organizing and using\r\ninternational experience in this sphere, forming a system of\r\neducating a society and creating a spirit of peace,\r\ndemocracy, human rights and tolerance, implementing\r\nactivities promoting respect for and observance of human\r\nrights and the rights of minorities and establishing non-\r\nviolence as the most important condition for the effective\r\nprevention of conflicts.\r\nIn supporting the adoption by the General Assembly\r\nof a programme of action on a culture of peace, the Russian\r\ndelegation expresses the hope that the implementation of its\r\nprovisions will promote the utilization of the basic purposes\r\nof the United Nations, first and foremost, to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war and to\r\nreaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and in the\r\ndignity and worth of the human person.\r\nMr. Kpotsra (Togo) (interpretation from French): As\r\nwe have been able to see, the question of promoting a\r\nculture of peace will be one of the priority objectives of the\r\ninternational community at the beginning of the next\r\nmillennium.\r\nIf that is so, it is because, according to the report on\r\nthis subject issued by the Secretary-General in coordination\r\nwith the Director-General of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO),\r\n“In a rapidly and deeply changing world\r\ncharacterized by the growing importance of ethical\r\nissues, a culture of peace provides future generations\r\nwith values that can help them to shape their destiny\r\nand actively participate in constructing a more just,\r\nhumane, free and prosperous society and a more\r\npeaceful world.” (A/53/370, part I, para. 7)\r\nOn reflection, it seems clear that the process began\r\nwith the very creation of the United Nations, founded on\r\nthe values of peace and justice and designed to build a\r\nmore just and peaceful world.\r\nBefore proceeding, on behalf of my delegation, I\r\nwould like to congratulate the Secretary-General, and\r\nthrough him the Director-General of UNESCO, on their\r\nexcellent report, which describes in great detail the major\r\nareas of action to be undertaken by the United Nations\r\nsystem and Member States in order to save future\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, hardship and\r\npoverty.\r\nAmong the actions to be undertaken, I wish to refer\r\nbriefly certain aspects that to my delegation seem\r\nessential. The building of a culture of peace, let us recall,\r\nis a task that requires wide-ranging educational, cultural,\r\nsocial and civic action. It is an endeavour that calls on\r\nevery individual and presupposes a strategy of openness\r\nat the family, national, regional and global levels designed\r\nto ensure that a culture of peace is an inextricable part of\r\nculture itself and that it is deeply rooted in the hearts and\r\nminds of all men and women.\r\nIt will be up to young States, and those of Africa in\r\nparticular, to work to strengthen the achievements of the\r\nnation State in artificially drawn geographic areas, a\r\nphenomenon that has already weakened the feeling of\r\nshared national community among populations living\r\nthere. This phenomenon seems to have acquired a new\r\ndimension, since the process of democratization — seen\r\nas having to take into account the specificities of each\r\npeople — has skidded out of control under the effect of\r\npressures from outside the continent and little understood\r\nnational realities. The inevitable consequence is that the\r\nsudden leap towards democratization in most of our States\r\nhas been accompanied by socio-political troubles that\r\nhave seriously frayed the social fabric and the efforts for\r\nnational unity undertaken following independence.\r\nIn addition to consolidation of the nation State, the\r\nmanagement of post-conflict periods on the African\r\ncontinent in particular, is, we believe, another essential\r\naspect to be taken into account in promoting a culture of\r\npeace. Indeed, since violence always breeds violence, if\r\nconcrete and appropriate actions are not taken in regions\r\naffected by conflict, we run the great risk of seeing those\r\nregions become constant settings for all types of\r\nconfrontation. It is therefore important to develop and\r\nbroaden the efforts made in this respect within the\r\nframework of the United Nations system. In this vein, we\r\nbelieve there is reason to hope that future peace\r\nagreements will be increasingly linked to the development\r\nof a culture of peace and that they will include national\r\nprogrammes on a culture of peace, calling upon parties to\r\na conflict to work together in implementing development\r\nprojects.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 54th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nIn the same vein, it is to be hoped that the follow-up\r\nto consideration of the important report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa will result in\r\nconcrete actions that can alter the present trends and help\r\nplace Africa on the path of real development, in peace and\r\nstability.\r\nThe vital need to promote a culture of peace also\r\nrequires a revitalization of the three United Nations regional\r\ncentres for peace and disarmament. In this connection, we\r\nare gratified at the renewed interest in these centres, which,\r\nwe are convinced, can contribute to improving\r\nunderstanding and cooperation among States in each of the\r\nregions concerned in the fields of peace, disarmament and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Government of Togo remains convinced that the\r\nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament\r\nin Africa — regarding which the First Committee, on 5\r\nNovember last, unanimously adopted a resolution calling\r\nfor its revitalization — can in the present context play a\r\nleading role by encouraging the adoption of confidence-\r\nbuilding measures at the regional level and thus foster\r\nprogress in the field of sustainable development. In so\r\ndoing, the Regional Centre will support the efforts made in\r\nthe framework of the mechanisms for prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts on the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nMy country, where the Centre is headquartered, takes\r\nthis opportunity to reiterate its heartfelt thanks to the\r\nfriendly States that have always contributed financially to\r\nthe Trust Fund for the Centre. We solemnly appeal for\r\nthe efforts now under way to revitalize it to be sustained\r\nand supported by all.\r\nAs the Declaration adopted at the end of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development proclaimed, social justice\r\nand the elimination of poverty are indispensable for the\r\nestablishment and maintenance of peace and security both\r\nwithin nations and between them. Likewise, as the United\r\nNations Development Programme so rightly affirms in its\r\nproposals, development that is focused on the human\r\nbeing is both a prerequisite for peace and the consequence\r\nof peace.\r\nThis demonstrates how important it is to ensure that\r\nthe other dimension, the elimination of poverty, will be\r\nthe object of particular attention in our campaign to\r\npromote a culture of peace. For if peace is to mean more\r\nthan just the absence of war, it must obviously have a\r\nclose relationship to economic development.\r\nHowever, despite the many efforts made by the\r\nAfrican States to reform their economies while\r\nbroadening the scope of democracy, they still face\r\neconomic and financial difficulties that do not allow them\r\nto meet the vital, minimum needs of their populations.\r\nHence, any effort to depart from the culture of\r\nviolence would be inherently flawed if the populations\r\nconcerned were to continue to live in a state of total\r\ndeprivation, since situations of poverty are always\r\nconducive to the emergence of conflicts. Therefore, the\r\ninteraction between the culture of peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment is the cornerstone of the task the community\r\nof States faces at the threshold of the new millennium.\r\nThe report submitted to us in this connection\r\ndescribes the major aspects of the task to be accomplished\r\nand sets certain guidelines. It remains for States,\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations,\r\nspecialized agencies and national civil societies equipped\r\nwith the necessary political will to fulfil the profound and\r\nlegitimate aspirations of the world’s peoples for a world\r\nof peace and justice, a world free of hardship and\r\npoverty.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n23\r\n"
