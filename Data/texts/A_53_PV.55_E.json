(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mungra\r\n(Suriname), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 31 (continued)\r\nCulture of peace\r\nNote by the Secretary-General, transmitting the\r\nreport of the Director-General of the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (A/53/370 and Add.1 and 2)\r\nDraft resolution (A/53/L.25)\r\nMs. Shahani (Philippines): In the past the Philippine\r\ndelegation has strongly supported the culture of peace\r\nprogramme of the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and it will continue\r\nto do so. Having itself experienced the tragic consequences\r\nof armed conflict both at the national and international\r\nlevels, the Philippines is strongly committed to peace.\r\nWithin the context of its national culture of peace\r\nprogramme, the Philippines sponsored the second\r\nInternational Forum on the Culture of Peace in Manila in\r\n1995 in cooperation with UNESCO.\r\nIn 1996, the Philippine Government signed the peace\r\nAgreement with the Moro National Liberation Front\r\n(MNLF), thereby ending decades of bitter domestic conflict.\r\nIn recognition of their role in bringing about peace in the\r\nsouthern Philippines, former President Fidel V. Ramos\r\nand Nur Misuari, the leader of the MNLF and Governor\r\nof the autonomous region of Muslim Mindanao, were\r\nawarded jointly the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize\r\nin June 1998. In March of this year, the UNESCO “Cities\r\nfor Peace” prize was also awarded to the mayor of one of\r\nthe major cities of the Philippines. We therefore fully\r\nwelcome the initiative of the United Nations to develop\r\na culture of peace.\r\nIn this connection, may I also inform this body that\r\nthe Philippines participated actively in the 1998\r\nStockholm Conference on Cultural Policies for\r\nDevelopment. We would to commend former Secretary-\r\nGeneral Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and his team for the work\r\nthey did in putting out the great report entitled “Our\r\nCreative Diversity” as the final report of the World\r\nCommission on Culture and Development.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nand the Director-General of UNESCO, Mr. Federico\r\nMayor, for their collaboration in preparing the report\r\nbefore us, particularly the draft declaration and draft\r\nprogramme of action on a culture of peace. On the whole,\r\nwe can say that the Philippines is satisfied with the draft\r\ntexts before us, but we would like to see the strengthening\r\nof certain points, such as the emphasis on the\r\ntransformation of the individual and of his or her lifestyle,\r\nwhich would be conducive to the creation of a peaceful\r\nyet creative life.\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nWe agree that the challenge of promoting a culture of\r\npeace should be placed at the centre of the United Nations\r\nagenda for the year 2000. We share the view that the\r\nprincipal task of the United Nations at the beginning of the\r\nnext millennium is to link the various peace efforts\r\nthroughout the world and promote a global movement for\r\npeace. We know that consensus-building, norm-setting,\r\nmediation and arbitration are the strengths of the United\r\nNations system. This clearly demonstrates, after many\r\nyears, that the Member States of the United Nations share\r\na common vision and have already begun putting in place\r\nthe building blocks for a culture of peace.\r\nWhile it is essential that the United Nations and the\r\nMember States cooperate with civil society in this\r\nundertaking, in our view Governments must take a leading\r\nrole in this regard. We therefore support the establishment\r\nof strategies for national action by Member States.\r\nHowever, my delegation would also like to stress forcefully\r\nduring this debate the role of non-governmental\r\norganizations and of individuals themselves, for it is they\r\nwho will provide the inspiration, the credibility and the\r\npurity of intention for such a noble undertaking as the\r\ncreation of a culture of peace. For at the heart of such\r\nmovements, it is the lives of great individuals, both known\r\nand unknown, who provide the direction, the spark of\r\ninspiration. Think of the lives of Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson\r\nMandela, Gautama Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed.\r\nThe bottom line in achieving the culture of peace is\r\nfor individuals themselves to become non-violent. We\r\nsuggest, therefore, educational programmes on values\r\nformation, values education and values inculcation. As the\r\nnon-violent revolution of 1986 in the Philippines showed,\r\nit was the common people, individuals themselves rather\r\nthan institutions, who chose the path of non-violence. Let\r\nus make no mistake: those who live by the sword will die\r\nby the sword. Non-violence, peace and harmony must begin\r\nwith us. It would be a major mistake, in the view of our\r\ndelegation, if we looked at the culture of peace as an\r\nintellectual, technical or even diplomatic exercise. It is an\r\nindividual, spiritual undertaking. We would commend or\r\nendorse the values of meditation, silence, detachment and\r\nmoral discipline. All of this must be practised by all of us\r\nin our daily lives if we are to live and breathe in a culture\r\nof peace in the coming century.\r\nWith regard to the preparation for the International\r\nYear for the Culture of Peace, a draft executive order is\r\nnow awaiting the signature of our head of State, President\r\nJoseph Estrada, to create a national committee for the\r\nculture of peace. This committee will prepare the national\r\nplan of action and a programme of activities for the year.\r\nOur President himself gives high priority to the issue of\r\nlaw and order. This proposed national committee will\r\nhave an intersectoral character and approach, with a\r\nmembership coming from Government and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. It will include women and\r\nmen as important focal points for the culture of peace\r\nprogramme, and it will ensure the involvement of the\r\nmedia in its activities.\r\nIn the past, the United Nations looked at peace as\r\nmerely the absence of war or conflict. But as we\r\napproach the millennium, peace should be seen in a more\r\npositive light, not only as the absence of conflict, but as\r\nthe flowering of the human spirit, the prerequisite for\r\neconomic prosperity and social solidarity. But peace, as\r\nI have said, must mean individual transformation, it\r\ncannot be just a legal or an intellectual exercise. I hope\r\nthat as we approach the twenty-first century, we will\r\nrealize that we cannot have a peaceful world unless we\r\nourselves are peaceful human beings.\r\nThe twentieth century has been a century of\r\nviolence, war and conflict. Let us hope that the twenty-\r\nfirst century will be one of peace, harmony and\r\nmoderation, where the human spirit can flower in all its\r\nglory, nobility and purity. The Philippine delegation is\r\nvery willing to cooperate in any way it can to promote\r\nthe item before us.\r\nMr. Dos Santos (Mozambique): Allow me to thank\r\nyou, Sir, for giving us this opportunity to make our\r\nhumble contribution to the discussion of this item on the\r\nculture of peace.\r\nThe importance that the people of Mozambique\r\nattach to the principle of peace and non-violence is based\r\nupon our long experience of about 30 years of successive\r\nwars and violence, from the liberation struggle against\r\ncolonialism to destabilization.\r\nThis dark page of the country’s history resulted in\r\nloss of life for many Mozambicans and non-citizens, the\r\ndestruction of the economic and social infrastructure, the\r\ndisruption of the social fabric and the creation of groups\r\nof poorest among the poor, consisting of displaced\r\npersons and refugees, most of whom were women,\r\nchildren or elderly.\r\nThe Rome Peace Agreement of 1992 resulted from\r\nthe genuine willingness of the people of Mozambique to\r\nput an end to this cycle of wars and violence. It paved the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nway for the launching of collective efforts towards ensuring\r\nthe restoration of durable peace in the country.\r\nThe Mozambicans decided to bury the hatred deeply\r\nsown in their hearts and heal the wounds of war by\r\ninitiating an era of continuous dialogue in an environment\r\nof tolerance, unity in diversity and respect for individual\r\nfreedoms and the rule of law. This choice was hard and\r\npainful, but its success in laying the foundations for the\r\ncountry’s lasting peace and sustainable development cannot\r\nbe denied.\r\nThe democratic elections held in October 1994, with\r\nthe participation of all political segments in the country,\r\nwas the reaffirmation of the desire of all Mozambicans to\r\nconsolidate peace and stability and embrace the new\r\npolitical and judicial framework enshrined in the 1990\r\nConstitution, thus laying the foundations for a democratic\r\nsociety based on the universal principles of freedom and\r\nequality.\r\nThe programme of the elected Government represents\r\na clear indication of our aspirations, and hence includes\r\namong its highest priorities the revitalization of democratic\r\ninstitutions, the promotion of respect for human rights, the\r\nprovision of education and health services for the\r\npopulation and the creation of basic conditions for\r\nrelaunching the development of an economy seriously\r\ndevastated by the war. We believe that the cornerstone of\r\nthe successes we have so far achieved has been the\r\npromotion of the principles of forgiveness, tolerance and\r\nreconciliation, which we consider to be the essence of a\r\nculture of peace.\r\nThe success in strengthening peace in Mozambique\r\nplaces on us a responsibility to contribute actively to the\r\nsame end in other places, as long as conflicts or potential\r\nconflicts persist in Africa, the most affected continent, or\r\nelsewhere in the world. In keeping with that principle,\r\nMozambique has actively participated in several\r\ninternational initiatives organized by, inter alia, the United\r\nNations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity, other regional organizations and individual\r\nStates, in a search for lasting solutions to conflicts still\r\nravaging many parts of the world.\r\nIn September 1997, the Government of Mozambique,\r\nin collaboration with UNESCO, convened in Maputo the\r\nInternational Conference on Culture of Peace and\r\nGovernance. The Conference, in which more than 300\r\ndelegates participated, was a singular opportunity for\r\nMozambicans of different tendencies to exchange point of\r\nviews with participants from various countries on the\r\nissue of the culture of peace.\r\nHaving read the Secretary-General’s consolidated\r\nreport containing a draft declaration and programme of\r\naction on a culture of peace, we would like to commend\r\nits submission in response to General Assembly resolution\r\n52/13.\r\nI would like to seize this opportunity to express our\r\nfirm belief that the draft declaration and programme of\r\naction offer an excellent framework for the active\r\ninvolvement of all actors at national, regional and\r\ninternational levels in various areas of the culture of\r\npeace, including conflict resolution and prevention, human\r\nrights, consolidation of democracy, elimination of poverty\r\nand development.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\r\nis the major responsibility not only of the United Nations\r\nbut of all peace-loving nations, institutions and\r\nindividuals. Hence, we also share the idea that the culture\r\nof peace should become a priority for the entire United\r\nNations system, making a valuable contribution to\r\neliminating the root causes of conflicts in the world and\r\nintroducing a culture of peace worldwide.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the proclamation by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the year 2000 as the International\r\nYear for the Culture of Peace. This would be a clear\r\nindication of the renewed commitment of the United\r\nNations to mobilizing all international actors to work\r\ntogether for a better world free from the scourge of war\r\nthat today affects many parts of the world, and Africa in\r\nparticular.\r\nLikewise, we support the proclamation of the period\r\n2001-2010 as the International Decade for a Culture of\r\nPeace and Non-violence for the Children of the World.\r\nThis would be a positive beginning of a new millennium\r\ndedicated to joining efforts to bring about peace,\r\nharmony, human rights, democracy and development in\r\nall corners of the world.\r\nThe causes of conflicts are intrinsically linked to\r\npoverty and development, especially in the developing\r\nworld and in Africa in particular, where most of them\r\noccur, as was recognized in the recent report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict in Africa.\r\nTherefore, we reaffirm that all actions aimed at achieving\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nand consolidating peace must be accompanied by concrete\r\nmeasures addressing the fundamental causes of conflicts.\r\nIf we do not address seriously the problems of abject\r\npoverty, hunger, illiteracy, and disease, which affect one\r\nfifth of the world’s population, international peace and\r\nsecurity will always be in jeopardy. We need to promote\r\ninvestment and economic growth, ensuring adequate levels\r\nof international aid, a reduction of the debt burden and the\r\nopening of international markets to the developing world.\r\nThe culture of peace will not take root and cannot\r\nproduce the results to which we all aspire unless\r\nGovernments, political actors and social actors in general\r\nundertake more vigorous action aimed at promoting human\r\ndevelopment, particularly in the fields of education, health\r\nand housing. On the other hand, communities and nations\r\nmust also demonstrate their genuine willingness to embark\r\non an open and constant dialogue and to embrace tolerance\r\nand reconciliation as a means of solving their problems, and\r\nmust abandon the culture of violence, hatred and revenge.\r\nPeace is not merely the absence of war. It goes\r\nbeyond that, demanding a continuous spirit of tolerance,\r\nreconciliation and enduring commitment to sharing a\r\ncountry’s assets, transcending particular and localized\r\ninterests. Tolerance and reconciliation should be a matter of\r\nconcern not only among politicians and political elites, but\r\nalso and above all among families, communities and society\r\nin general. A culture of peace must be born out of all\r\ncitizens as a unitary value, encompassing the ideas of peace\r\nand non-violence disseminated and transformed into an\r\nintrinsic part of the collective conscience of people.\r\nThere is general consensus on what a culture of peace\r\nshould entail. We need to deepen our collective\r\nunderstanding of the concept. We see the concept of the\r\nculture of peace as a set of values, attitudes and behaviours,\r\nways of living and acting, based on respect for life, the\r\ndignity and rights of the human person, rejection of\r\nviolence, including all forms of terrorism, and commitment\r\nto the principles of freedom, justice, solidarity, tolerance\r\nand understanding among all peoples and groups in society\r\nand among individuals.\r\nThe culture of peace is based on universally accepted\r\nfundamental principles of human coexistence, full\r\nparticipation of all citizens and transparency in decision-\r\nmaking and in the management of public affairs. It derives\r\nfrom a constant search for consensus, values of unity and\r\nharmony and peaceful settlement of differences. In this\r\nregard, diversity is seen as a cultural asset, a positive\r\nfactor to value and promote.\r\nThe Government of Mozambique envisages the\r\nintroduction of a culture of peace in teaching institutions.\r\nThis approach is based on the assumption that education\r\nfor peace has particular importance in conflict prevention,\r\nsince it is first and last in the minds of men and women\r\nthat ideas likely to manifest themselves in violence can be\r\nfound. We believe that such concrete measures will allow\r\nus to move from rhetoric to action. Promoting a culture\r\nof peace today will be a valuable heritage we can bestow\r\non future generations. That will be a major contribution\r\ntowards preparing ourselves to face the challenges of the\r\nnext millennium.\r\nMozambique reaffirms its commitment to a culture\r\nof peace, and will continue to lend its modest contribution\r\ntowards that noble goal.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): At its fifty-second session, the General\r\nAssembly considered the question of a culture of peace.\r\nA large number of States, including my own, made\r\nstatements setting out their understanding of the concept\r\nof a culture of peace and offered important views on how\r\nto develop this initiative. Today again we are discussing\r\nthe effects of culture on mankind’s efforts to create a\r\nworld based on equality among States, and on the right of\r\nStates to sovereignty and freedom.\r\nCulture is the sum total of the historical heritage of\r\npeoples. It is their conscience, their logic and their way of\r\nthinking. Peace is mankind’s pursuit of a noble objective;\r\nin brief it means giving the world’s peoples every\r\nopportunity collectively and individually to achieve full\r\ngrowth and development free from conflicts, hegemony,\r\nexploitation and occupation.\r\nHence, we view the formation of a culture of peace\r\nas meaning the education of mankind in the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter and in the principles of\r\ninternational law and of humanitarian law. These concepts\r\nleave no room for interference in the internal affairs of\r\nStates, absolutely reject foreign occupation, uphold justice\r\nand equality in international relations, and recognize the\r\nright of peoples to self-determination.\r\nPeace and a culture of peace as we understand these\r\nconcepts mean far more than the mere absence of war.\r\nThere can be no peace with continued occupation, settler\r\ncolonialism and the displacement of the sons and\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\ndaughters of the occupied territories. Peace also implies a\r\ncommitment to renouncing the use, threat of use or\r\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons. A culture of peace cannot\r\nbe neutral in the face of the catastrophes of foreign\r\noccupation, hunger, poverty, displacement and repression,\r\nbecause these scourges pose a threat to the international\r\ncommunity and sow tension and chaos in international\r\nrelations. The world needs to be further educated in peace,\r\nbased on the renunciation of occupation, aggression and\r\nsettler colonialism, and on the call for cooperation,\r\nsolidarity and mutual support, in order to close the rapidly\r\ngrowing and deepening chasm between the society of power\r\nand wealth and the society of abject poverty, suffering and\r\ndeath.\r\nHuman history has witnessed social and political\r\nphenomena spawned in an environment of evil, such as\r\nracist repression and the craving to continue foreign\r\noccupation, aggression, injustice and repression. How can\r\nwe talk logically, intellectually and philosophically of a\r\nculture of peace in a world that has not yet eliminated\r\nforeign occupation, a world in which the poor are growing\r\nin numbers and in poverty, a world in which some 400\r\nindividuals possess funds that exceed the combined annual\r\nincomes of countries with a total population of 2.5\r\nbillion — 45 per cent of the world’s people — not to\r\nmention the hundreds of millions of people who are hungry\r\nor the more than 200 million children suffering from\r\nmalnutrition for a variety of reasons?\r\nBy definition, a culture of peace is inimical to a\r\nculture of war. A culture of peace cannot stand silent in the\r\nface of the challenges confronting society. I affirm that it\r\nwould be a serious mistake to consider the question of a\r\nculture of peace as though today’s world were free of war\r\nand of its underlying causes. Human history has recorded\r\nthe withering of many cultures and noble ideas because\r\nthey lacked a champion when they were assailed by the\r\nenemies of peace.\r\nIn this connection, the Arabs — who have made peace\r\nan integral part of their culture, their heritage and their\r\ndaily conduct and an intrinsic element of their lives and\r\ncustoms — view it as entirely natural that the United\r\nNations and its agencies should vigorously address and\r\npromote the noble values of a just peace, an honourable\r\npeace, a dignified peace. It was in that vein that the Arabs\r\naccepted the United Nations concept for the attainment of\r\npeace in the Middle East region while the Israeli side\r\ncontinues to reject United Nations resolutions relating to the\r\nattainment of peace on the basis of the principle of land for\r\npeace. Israel also refuses to implement Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nMoreover, the present Israeli Government is sparing no\r\neffort to sow the seeds of a new war of aggression, whose\r\nhallmarks are Israel’s acquisition of devastating nuclear\r\nweapons and its shirking of commitments and\r\nundertakings agreed upon during the peace talks.\r\nA culture of peace is a legitimate aspiration for the\r\nfuture and, as stressed in more than one place in the\r\nreport contained in document A/53/370 and its addenda,\r\nan endeavour to prevent conflicts by tackling their root\r\ncauses. It is not a question of controlling peoples or of\r\npreventing them from attaining their aspiration to liberate\r\ntheir lands and eliminate the injustices that have\r\nthroughout history been inflicted upon them in unfair and\r\noppressive circumstances.\r\nIf the essence of the culture of peace is intervention\r\nto prevent the outbreak of armed conflict, then it is\r\nincumbent on the international community to discourage\r\nthe current Israeli Government from pursuing its policies\r\nthat run counter to the culture of peace and to prevail\r\nupon it through various means to refrain from its\r\ncolonialist settlement policies and withdraw from\r\noccupied Arab territories in Syrian Golan and Palestine\r\nand revert to the lines which existed on 4 June 1967. It\r\nshould also withdraw from southern Lebanon and the\r\nwestern Bekaa without conditions and recognize the\r\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\r\nWe also feel that the right of peoples to defend their\r\nland, independence and sovereignty should be an integral\r\npart of the culture of peace and that peoples and States of\r\nthe world should continue to support such struggles.\r\nExperience has shown that policies which violate the\r\nrights and the sovereignty of peoples provide fertile\r\ngrounds for continued violence and bloodshed.\r\nWe view the plurality of cultures in the world as a\r\npositive element which enriches the culture of peace; that\r\nculture of peace must reflect the sum total of these\r\ncultures. We are pleased to see that the draft declaration\r\nand programme of action before us include repeated\r\nreferences to this.\r\nWe at the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab\r\nRepublic to the United Nations have studied the\r\ncomprehensive report submitted by the Director-General\r\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and which includes the draft\r\ndeclaration and programme of action on a culture of\r\npeace. We view with satisfaction the statements in that\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nreport which indicate the need to strengthen understanding\r\namong cultures. We are also pleased by UNESCO’s\r\npublication of books on the histories of mankind, and\r\nAfrica, the cultures of Central Asia, and the contribution\r\nmade by the Arab civilization toward the cultures of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, as well as books on the various\r\naspects of Islamic culture, the general history of Latin\r\nAmerica, and the history of the Caribbean.\r\nWith regard to the draft declaration and programme of\r\naction on a culture of peace, the delegation of Syria views\r\nwith satisfaction the references to the principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, UNESCO’s Constitution and\r\nvarious other international instruments, as well as to\r\npromoting the equality in rights and opportunities for men\r\nand women. However, we feel that the failure to deal with\r\nforeign occupation, racism, xenophobia, racial\r\ndiscrimination and nuclear weapons and the threat they pose\r\nrepresents a departure from reality which necessitates\r\ndealing with aspects of the greatest threats to international\r\npeace and security. Unless these issues are dealt with,\r\nefforts to promote a culture of peace will remain a mere\r\nintellectual luxury. We would like to point out that the\r\ntwelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement affirmed\r\nthese elements that we also feel should be included in the\r\ndraft declaration and programme of action before us.\r\nSyria, whose people are heirs to a great age-old\r\nculture that dates back thousands of years and which gave\r\nman the first alphabet in history, looks forward now as ever\r\nto a world free from occupation and hegemony in which\r\nthe principles of justice, equality and peace prevail.\r\nMr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan) (interpretation from\r\nRussian): Allow me first of all to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the\r\nDirector-General of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),\r\nMr. Federico Mayor, for the consolidated report they\r\nsubmitted, which contains the draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action on a culture of peace.\r\nAs the report points out, there is currently a process\r\nunder way to establish a culture of peace. The seriousness\r\nand breadth of that endeavour should receive its due place\r\namong United Nations priorities. The creation of the United\r\nNations system, based on values commonly shared by all\r\nmankind, in itself became a major step forward towards a\r\nculture of peace. International action taken under the\r\nauspices of the Organization — especially that set out in\r\nthe declaration and programme of action in the consolidated\r\nreport — reflects the development and strengthening of\r\ngeneral standards, values and goals which are the basis\r\nfor the further development of the concept of a culture of\r\npeace.\r\nAs you know, UNESCO’s primary task is to instill\r\nin the consciousness of peoples a firm foundation for the\r\nidea of peace. The organization calls upon mankind to\r\nfight against war, to eradicate violence and poverty and\r\nto respect democratic principles. In this connection, the\r\nprovisions set forth in the declaration are especially\r\nappropriate today, when conflicts abound in various\r\nregions of the world. The declaration clearly reflects the\r\nbasic tasks on the agenda for the third millennium, which\r\nmust begin in a spirit of non-violence, mutual\r\nunderstanding, dialogue and tolerance — in other words,\r\nin a spirit of gradually moving away from the ideology of\r\nwar and moving towards the basic values of a culture of\r\npeace.\r\nAchieving the goals and strategies put forward in the\r\nprogramme of action on a culture of peace is first and\r\nforemost linked with the coordination and strengthening\r\nof mutual actions to preserve and develop stability and\r\ntrust among nations. In this connection, it is very\r\nimportant that Member States develop their own national\r\nprogrammes of action, thereby adding to this programme.\r\nHere, the goal of education should be one of the basic\r\ntools in carrying out this important mission. As was\r\npointed out in the report prepared for UNESCO by the\r\nInternational Commission on Education for the Twenty-\r\nfirst Century, the goal of education lies in learning to live\r\ntogether. Moreover, the report submitted to UNESCO by\r\nthe World Commission on Culture and Development\r\nmentions that we can develop diverse peaceful methods\r\nof coexistence through culture.\r\nUNESCO’s basic principles in the areas of tolerance,\r\nhuman rights and democracy have been reflected in the\r\nmain topic of the 155th session of its Executive Board:\r\n“The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, a duty to remember and to be vigilant —\r\nfrom slavery to the full attainment of human dignity”, and\r\nparticularly in the documents adopted at the final meeting\r\nof the Board’s 155th session, which was held on 6\r\nNovember 1998 in Tashkent.\r\nThe decision on a culture of peace adopted in\r\nTashkent, which is contained in A/53/370/Add.1, thanks\r\nthe Director-General for having launched the culture of\r\npeace initiative and expresses satisfaction that the United\r\nNations proclaimed the year 2000 as the International\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nYear for the Culture of Peace, as well as designating\r\nUNESCO as coordinator for the programme of action.\r\nAs the representative of Uzbekistan, it is a pleasure for\r\nme to point out that my country was elected a member of\r\nthe Executive Board last year at the twenty-ninth session of\r\nUNESCO’s General Conference. We will participate very\r\nactively in its work.\r\nIn keeping with UNESCO’s fundamental goal, as\r\nenshrined in its Constitution — to instil the idea of the\r\ndefence of peace — the process of the culture of peace\r\npresupposes that culture, spirituality and education can save\r\nthe world from darkness and vandalism, religious and\r\nnational extremism, ethnic confrontation and regional\r\nconflicts.\r\nAs was noted at the Tashkent meeting of the\r\nExecutive Board of UNESCO, this idea is today very\r\nrelevant. Various parts of the world are seeing an increase\r\nin international and religious confrontation; many threats\r\nare becoming global in nature; and many areas are ravaged\r\nby armed conflicts — both old and new — that are based\r\non religious, ethnic and international differences. In\r\nAfghanistan and in the Middle East, in the Balkans and in\r\nAfrica, innocent people are dying. Historical artifacts are\r\nbeing consumed by the flames of conflict — artifacts that\r\nby law belong to the common cultural heritage of\r\nhumankind.\r\nUnfortunately, regional and local conflicts, religious\r\nextremism, terrorism, the drug trade and the illegal arms\r\ntrade continue to threaten the stability of the world and\r\nsecurity, not only in our region but throughout the world.\r\nMounting a defence against these threats is the goal of\r\nUNESCO, whose very creation was dictated by the United\r\nNations need to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war through “the intellectual and moral\r\nsolidarity of humankind as a whole”, as set out in the fifth\r\npreambular paragraph of UNESCO’s Constitution.\r\nIn this connection, we welcome UNESCO’s\r\ninternational ”Bridge” programme, which has strengthened\r\ninteraction with the countries of Central Asia. The goal is\r\nto study and analyse the political transformations that have\r\ntaken place in the context of the quest to avert war and\r\nethnic conflict.\r\nUzbekistan, which attaches great importance to the\r\nrevival of ethnicity and the development of national culture,\r\nfeels that renewed national awareness cannot be divorced\r\nfrom the ideals of a global culture and shared human\r\nvalues. The history and culture of the Uzbek nation is an\r\nintegral and inalienable part of human civilization. The\r\npeople of Uzbekistan have been able to preserve their\r\nhistorical and cultural values and ethnic traditions, which\r\nhave been carefully handed on from generation to\r\ngeneration.\r\nNow that independence has been attained, the names\r\nand noble deeds of great Uzbek historical figures have\r\nbeen given new prominence. These include Imam Al-\r\nBukhari, Bahauddin Nakshbandi, Khwaja Ahmed Yassavi,\r\nMohammed Al-Khoresmi, Al-Biruni, Ibn Sino, Ulugbek\r\nand many others, who have made a tremendous\r\ncontribution not only to the development of our\r\nmultinational culture but also to world civilization.\r\nWe sincerely thank the leadership of UNESCO for\r\nits support, which has helped to preserve our cultural\r\nheritage and bring to light our nation’s true history. An\r\nexample of this support was the week-long programme\r\ndedicated to the development of science, culture and\r\neducation at the time of the Timurid Dynasty. Held in\r\nParis in 1996, the event was devoted to the 660th\r\nanniversary of the birth of Timur, that great son of the\r\nUzbek nation, and was a major milestone in the history of\r\nthe cooperation between Uzbekistan and UNESCO.\r\nAs a result of the UNESCO “Project on an Integral\r\nStudy of the Silk Roads: Roads of Dialogue”, an\r\ninternational institute devoted to Central Asian research\r\nwas set up in Samarkand. Its goal is to study the\r\ncivilization of Central Asia in order to educate the world\r\nabout the great history of the peoples of that region and\r\nabout eastern civilization, which remains largely\r\nunexplored. It aims also to leave to our descendants a\r\nclear picture of all of the historic changes taking place\r\ntoday in the Central Asian countries that are pursuing\r\nrenewal and progress.\r\nFor 1,000 years very diverse religions, cultures and\r\nlifestyles coexisted in Uzbekistan. Our experience of\r\npeaceful coexistence among peoples of differing religious\r\nbeliefs and creeds is testimony to the fact that this can be\r\nan element in the successful resolution of internal and\r\nregional conflicts that have international religious and\r\nethnic foundations.\r\nIn its final provisions, the Tashkent Declaration calls\r\nupon Member States to adopt all the necessary measures\r\nto provide for the successful conducting of the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace, 2000, and\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nthus confirm the values of tolerance, mutual understanding\r\nand the fight against poverty, and marginalization.\r\nUzbekistan welcomes and stresses the importance of the\r\nresolution adopted by the Economic and Social Council\r\ndesignating 2001-2010 as the International Decade for a\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of the\r\nWorld, and we are ready actively to participate in its\r\nimplementation. We also believe that the question of the\r\nculture of peace should be one of the basic items on the\r\nagenda of the Assembly for the year 2000.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me once again to express the\r\nsupport of the Government of Uzbekistan for the draft\r\ndeclaration and programme of action for the culture of\r\npeace and to call for its speedy implementation by the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOne of the obligations enshrined in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations is the duty to save succeeding generations\r\nfrom the scourge of war. This should be our motto, because\r\nwe have such tremendous potential. But we need to use it\r\non a timely basis. The broad participation of countries and\r\nnations throughout the world under the auspices of\r\nUNESCO in the realization of the ideas of the culture of\r\npeace and humanism will allow us to bring peoples together\r\nto make the world safer and more secure. This should be\r\nour sole “weapon” towards the establishment of peace and\r\ncooperation.\r\nMr. Yere (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): The delegation of Côte d’Ivoire is pleased to take\r\nthe floor to express its gratification at the fact that the\r\nquestion of a culture of peace has been placed on our\r\nagenda as a separate item. My country was associated with\r\nthe launching of the initiative that has resulted in today’s\r\nGeneral Assembly debate.\r\nI should like also to congratulate the Secretary-General\r\nfor the excellent report he has presented to us, which was\r\ndrafted in close cooperation with the Director-General of\r\nUNESCO and which contains a draft declaration and\r\nprogramme of action for the culture of peace.\r\nThe concept of a culture of peace was born nearly\r\nfour decades ago in Côte d’Ivoire. It emerged from the\r\npolitical philosophy of our first President, Mr. Félix\r\nHouphouët-Boigny. That idea was solemnly enshrined at\r\nthe International Congress on Peace in the Minds of Men,\r\norganized by UNESCO in July 1989 in Yamoussoukro, the\r\npolitical capital of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nToday we are inspired by a feeling of both pride and\r\njoy at seeing that this idea has come so far as to become\r\na basic element of international relations.\r\nDuring the relatively recent era of African\r\ndecolonization, which was characterized both by struggles\r\nfor liberation and fratricidal and inter-ethnic conflicts —\r\nat a time when it was hardly wise to speak out against the\r\nlogic of violence and war prevailing on our continent —\r\nmy country had the courage to suggest that dialogue\r\nshould serve as a means of settling disputes and of\r\nbuilding peace within each African nation, between\r\nnations and between continents.\r\n“Peace is not a hollow word, it is a way of life”,\r\nPresident Félix Houphouët-Boigny liked to say. Peace is\r\nnot some weapon wielded by human beings. It is inherent\r\nin human nature. It is therefore necessary to preserve\r\nwithin human beings this value that they tend too often to\r\nset aside in favour of their instincts to make war or act\r\nviolently. To do this we must, inter alia, focus on\r\neducating the young, on special training programmes for\r\npolitical actors and on a resolute policy of dialogue\r\namong the basic political institutions and with civil\r\nsociety. This is how we have understood the culture of\r\npeace, and this is how we apply it in Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nMy country welcomes the establishment by the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) in 1989 of the international\r\nFélix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize, mentioned this\r\nmorning by the Ambassadors of Bangladesh and Senegal.\r\nThis award is\r\n“intended to honour individuals, bodies or\r\ninstitutions that have made a significant contribution\r\nto promoting, seeking, safeguarding or maintaining\r\npeace”.\r\nThe jury, which is chaired by Mr. Henry Kissinger,\r\nformer Secretary of State of the United States, has already\r\ngiven prizes to a number of internationally renowned\r\nindividuals and groups, such as Presidents Nelson\r\nMandela and Yasser Arafat, Prime Ministers Yitzhak\r\nRabin and Shimon Peres, the International Law Academy\r\nof The Hague, King Juan Carlos of Spain. Of the many\r\nother recipients, the President of Guatemala, Mr. Alvaro\r\nArzú Irigoyen, and Mr. Ricardo Ramírez de Léon, leader\r\nof the former opposition army, the Unidad Revolucionaria\r\nNacional Guatemalteca, deserve special mention for their\r\ncourage in putting an end to half a century of civil war in\r\ntheir country.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nThe elements of a culture of peace and the objectives\r\nof observing an International Year were already established\r\nlast year by an Economic and Social Council resolution. To\r\nrecall the main points of that resolution, the culture of\r\npeace is designed to promote, by means of education,\r\nscience and communication, a particular type of behaviour,\r\nso as to replace the climate of war and violence with\r\npeaceful coexistence both within every nation and among\r\nnations.\r\nPreparations for the commemoration of the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace have entered the\r\nfinal phase. The Assembly has before it a draft declaration\r\nand programme of action that UNESCO prepared in\r\ncooperation with all the other bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nThe Ivorian delegation hopes that these documents will\r\nfind favour with the Member States since they are intended\r\nto provide the bases for the commemoration of the\r\nInternational Year. Similarly, my delegation would like to\r\nhope — in view of the importance of a culture of peace\r\nand of the hopes that are undeniably attached to such an\r\nidea — that this topic will be included as a central theme\r\nof the Millennium Assembly to be held in the year 2000.\r\nMr. Bala (Nigeria): As this is the first opportunity I\r\nhave had to speak here since my head of State,\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, General\r\nAbdulsalami Abubakar, addressed the Assembly, I would\r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. His\r\nelection is a well-deserved honour, as his performance so\r\nfar has clearly demonstrated his qualities. We really wish\r\nhim a successful tenure.\r\nIt is a great honour and privilege for me to address\r\nthis session on this agenda item, which, though new on the\r\nUnited Nations agenda, is important and highly cherished\r\nby the people of Nigeria. The quest for peace and peaceful\r\ncoexistence is as old as history itself. It is, indeed, at the\r\ncentre of diplomacy The transition from confrontation to a\r\nculture of peace is a necessary prerequisite for any\r\nmeaningful socio-economic growth and for the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of all societies, rich or poor, strong or weak,\r\ndeveloped or developing. A culture of peace consists of a\r\nfull range of values, attitudes and behaviours that reflect\r\nand inspire social relationships based on the cherished\r\nprinciples of freedom, justice, democracy, human rights and\r\ntolerance.\r\nPeace is not only the absence of conflict; it is a\r\npositive force that must be nurtured and sustained in order\r\nto promote development. It recognizes and tolerates\r\ndifferences, promotes dialogue and endeavours to\r\ntransform all conflicts, through non-violent means, into\r\nshared understanding and cooperation.\r\nPeace is an imperative in our time, not only because\r\nwe now possess the wherewithal to destroy our planet\r\nseveral times over, but also because it is the right and\r\nrational thing to do. The quest for universal peace must\r\nremain our topmost priority. The arms race is\r\nanachronistic and debilitating. The peace dividend should\r\nbecome more evident as it is channelled to the alleviation\r\nof poverty worldwide, with a view to raising the living\r\nstandards of the most disadvantaged. There can be no\r\ndevelopment in any society without peace, and without\r\ndevelopment societies cannot prosper for the common\r\ngood and general well-being of peoples.\r\nPeace is a basic fundamental human right that must\r\nbe guaranteed to all without discrimination as to gender,\r\nrace or religious belief. We wish to recall that in his\r\nAgenda for Development the former Secretary-General\r\nidentified five basic elements of development, with peace\r\nas the foundation, the economy as the engine of progress,\r\nthe environment as a basis for sustainability, justice as a\r\npillar and democracy promoting the culture of tolerance,\r\ndiversity and freedom of association.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the approach adopted in the\r\nnote by the Secretary-General, which provides a\r\nconceptual framework that places due emphasis on the\r\nneed to identify and address the deep roots of war and\r\nviolence through education, as a necessary strategy to\r\nnurture the culture of peace. Its objectives include\r\nstrengthening respect for cultural diversity and promoting\r\ntolerance, solidarity, cooperation and dialogue.\r\nUnfortunately, instead of peace, the African\r\ncontinent has witnessed, over the past three decades,\r\nintractable conflicts and civil wars. These cause death and\r\nuseless destruction of lives, property and already poor\r\ninfrastructure. The human tragedy is even worse, as\r\nconflicts and wars create swarms of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons. The recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on “The causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa”\r\nprovides us with the latest statement on this deplorable\r\nstate of affairs. We were, however, reassured that it is the\r\nprimary aim of the United Nations to lead the way in the\r\nquest for peace, by providing the means through which\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nconflicts may be contained and resolved. Conflict\r\nprevention, both within and between States, must\r\nnecessarily begin by eliminating the sources of tension\r\nthrough prompt action.\r\nIt is worth noting that in executing this mandate, the\r\nUnited Nations now brings regional organizations on board\r\nin a cooperative effort. The cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity’s (OAU)\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution in Africa is a shining example. It is our sincere\r\nhope and desire that the United Nations and the OAU will\r\ncontinue to work closely together in our collective efforts\r\nto bring lasting peace and sustainable development to our\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe success story of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG) in the West African subregion — in Liberia\r\nand Sierra Leone — clearly demonstrates that where such\r\nregional initiatives exist they stand a greater chance of\r\nsuccess if their peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts are\r\nadequately and promptly supported by the Security Council.\r\nECOMOG represents a unique initiative by a subregional\r\norganization within the framework of regional arrangements\r\nfor crisis management and conflict resolution.\r\nI would like to request our Organization not to relent\r\nin its efforts to provide ECOMOG with the technical and\r\nlogistical support that it requires to execute its ongoing\r\nmandate in Sierra Leone. We appreciate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to strengthen the United Nations office in\r\nFreetown and the Organization’s involvement in the\r\ndisarmament and demobilization activities of the\r\ncombatants, as well as the deployment of military liaison\r\nand security advisory personnel to Freetown.\r\nFurthermore, post-conflict peace-building must be\r\ngiven serious consideration and attention not only in Sierra\r\nLeone but also elsewhere in Africa where the populations\r\nhave suffered untold hardship resulting from war and civil\r\nstrife.\r\nNor can I fail to draw the attention of the Assembly\r\nto the increased cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand our subregional organization, ECOWAS and the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC). My\r\nGovernment will continue to encourage these positive\r\nexperiences to promote a more rational and cost-effective\r\nsynergy between these institutions, thereby bringing life to\r\nthe provisions of Chapter VIII of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nIn conclusion, the international community has a\r\nduty to create a global consensus and evolve the culture\r\nof peace in the minds of the world’s people. With the\r\ngrowing interdependence among nations, it should focus\r\non building bridges across nations and reaching out to\r\nother civilizations in fraternal and non-competitive\r\ndialogue to attain that universal civilization that is very\r\ndear to our African statesman and poet, Léopold Sédar\r\nSenghor of Senegal, a member of the French Academy.\r\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization were right in\r\nobserving that wars begin in the minds of men, and it is\r\nto the minds of men that we must return for solutions to\r\nthe problems of war.\r\nFinally, Nigeria is a convinced co-sponsor of the\r\ndraft resolution before us, by which the Assembly, on the\r\nrecommendation of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nwould proclaim the period from 2001 to 2010 as the\r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nviolence for the Children of the World. I am therefore\r\ndelighted to support the draft declaration and programme\r\nof action and to commend this draft resolution, to the\r\nAssembly for adoption without a vote.\r\nMr. Jose (India): I am privileged to speak to the\r\nplenary of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly\r\non the “Consolidated report containing a draft declaration\r\nand programme of action on a culture of peace”, under\r\nagenda item 31, “Culture of peace”. We would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General, the Director-General of the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and other bodies of the United\r\nNations for building on the elements of the draft\r\ndeclaration and programme of action contained in last\r\nyear’s report with inputs from various quarters to produce\r\nthe present draft declaration, programme of action and\r\nconsolidated report.\r\nMy delegation made a number of substantive\r\ncomments on both the draft declaration and the\r\nprogramme of action during the discussions in the plenary\r\nas well as at the meeting of the UNESCO Executive\r\nBoard in Paris. We would briefly like to recapitulate the\r\npoints that we made for the benefit of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nFirst, we made a number of suggestions regarding\r\nthe format and rearrangement of ideas of the declaration\r\nand programme of action. In the declaratory part, we\r\nexpressed the preference that the document be drafted in\r\nsimple running prose rather than in the formal structure\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nof a preamble of articles. We also proposed a structure for\r\nthe declaration which better brought out the idea of a\r\nculture of peace, its genesis, its meaning and significance,\r\nits goals and objectives, the means to be adopted to realize\r\nthese goals and objectives, the responsibilities of the\r\nparticipating actors and its review and appraisal. We feel\r\nthat structuring the declaration and programme of action\r\naround these headings would better bring out the project of\r\na culture of peace. In particular, we expect that it would\r\nhelp the declaration avoid confusion between the goals and\r\nobjectives of a culture of peace and the means to achieve\r\nthem, which we found to be somewhat limited and limiting.\r\nMoreover, the richness of the information provided in the\r\nconsolidated report could have also been better reflected in\r\nthe draft declaration and programme of action.\r\nSection A, called “Aims and strategies”, in particular,\r\nis weak. The first point describes the objective of a culture\r\nof peace as one “which would contribute to the prevention\r\nof violent conflict”. This is a partial and negative definition\r\nof the objective. The objective of a culture of peace is both\r\nmore positive and comprehensive and is aimed at a much\r\ndeeper level of human endeavour that corresponds to the\r\nterm “culture”.\r\nSecondly, one of the objectives of the programme of\r\naction has been defined as linking activities for the building\r\nof a culture of peace with such priorities as human rights,\r\ndemocracy, development, equality of women, tolerance and\r\nfree flow of information. In fact, if we see the culture of\r\npeace at the level of creating a culture — a new culture of\r\npeace — surely these activities would constitute means of\r\nrealizing a culture of peace, and not merely activities\r\nseparate from or linked to it. There is hardly anything in\r\nthe declaration on the means to be adopted for realizing the\r\ngoals and objectives of a culture of peace. There is only\r\none paragraph where there is mention of means: article 6,\r\nwhich in part states that “Education is the principal means\r\nto build a culture of peace.”\r\nA full section in the declaration and programme of\r\naction on the means to be adopted to realize the goals and\r\nobjectives of a culture of peace would substantially\r\nstrengthen the document. Besides the elements already\r\nmentioned, it should include the importance of education in\r\ntolerance and the crucial role that can be played by symbols\r\nand institutions that promote tolerance, pluralism,\r\ncoexistence, accommodation, respect for diversity and, at a\r\ncognitive level, in particular, respect for “the other”. Not all\r\nbehaviour is learned behaviour. There is a lot of behaviour\r\nwhich is inherited, and a lot more that emanates from a\r\ncollective unconscious. There is also a need to consciously\r\nbuild the cognitive and unconscious dimensions that can\r\ncontribute to a culture of peace.\r\nThe role that development, economic cooperation\r\nand economic interdependence can play in contributing to\r\na culture of peace, in particular by creating a vested\r\ninterest in peace and prosperity, and the way in which\r\nUNESCO can incorporate such philosophies in its\r\ntransdisciplinary project, needs to be more fully explored.\r\nMoreover, the suggestions for action are heavily\r\ntilted in favour of measures for peace-building and\r\npreventive diplomacy.\r\nThus, there is an attempt to link the entire idea of a\r\nculture of peace to Chapter VI of the United Nations\r\nCharter. There is repeated reference to mediation,\r\nreconciliation, consensus-building, confidence-building\r\nand so forth. All the points in paragraph 13 of the draft\r\nprogramme of action relate to such activities. Such\r\nactivities are also mentioned in other paragraphs which\r\nare devoted to entirely different subjects.\r\nFor example, in paragraph 7 on actions to develop\r\neducation, training and research for peace and non-\r\nviolence, there is a reference to “special support for\r\ntraining in mediation and conflict resolution” and to\r\n“training which empowers people at all levels with\r\nthe peacemaking skills of dialogue, mediation,\r\nconflict transformation [and] consensus-building”.\r\nThese competences have less to do with a culture of\r\npeace and UNESCO than with diplomacy and the United\r\nNations. Also, in paragraph 8 on human development,\r\nthere is a reference to the “[i]ntegration of the dimension\r\nof conflict management into the development paradigm”\r\nand to “[d]evelopment assistance in post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding situations”. Similarly, in paragraph 9 on actions\r\nto foster democratic participation, there is a reference to\r\n“[s]ystematic training and capacity-building in\r\ndispute resolution for public officials as an important\r\ncomponent of development assistance”.\r\nIn the same section, there is also a mention of “[r]esearch\r\non experiences of national truth and conciliation\r\ncommissions”.\r\nWe are not suggesting that these elements should be\r\naltogether left out of the document, but that there should\r\nnot be a lopsided emphasis on these elements. The thrust\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nof the other sections should not be diluted by bringing these\r\nelements into such sections as well.\r\nThis imbalance in the draft programme of action must\r\nbe redressed for the following reasons. First, we are trying\r\nto put excessive emphasis on what is not directly within\r\nUNESCO’s competence; secondly, this kind of emphasis on\r\na culture of peace makes it a mechanical and quick-fix\r\nprocess, rather than an attitude of mind or a pattern of\r\nbehaviour; and thirdly, it detracts from the impact of ideas\r\nwhich are in the nature of an attitude of mind and a pattern\r\nof behaviour.\r\nThere is an important omission from paragraph 6 on\r\nactions to promote respect for human rights. The human\r\nright to peace, which is still evolving, has been mentioned,\r\nbut the rights of the child, particularly the right of the child\r\nto education, which have been accepted in the form of a\r\nlegal instrument, are not mentioned.\r\nFinally, the document leaves out some important\r\npositive ideas to which our delegation had made reference\r\nin plenary meeting on the subject of a culture of peace at\r\nUNESCO. These ideas, which are in the nature of the\r\npositive dimensions of peace, include the role of\r\nconstructive pluralism; the search for common ethical\r\nvalues in different civilizations and spiritualities celebrating\r\nhuman brotherhood and unity; the concept of non-violence;\r\nmeasures to deal with poverty, deprivation and\r\nmarginalization; measures to reduce inter-personal, inter-\r\ngroup and international inequalities with a view to\r\neliminating them; disparities and asymmetries in the world\r\norder of money, finance, trade and security; the issue of\r\ngovernance; and so on. The role of symbols and institutions\r\nthat nourish tolerance, pluralism and respect for “the other”,\r\nparticularly in heterogeneous populations, should also be\r\nexplored and built upon.\r\nAs stated by UNESCO, the culture of peace aims at\r\nbeing a major step in a deep transformation of the cultural\r\nroots of war and violence into a culture of peace and non-\r\nviolence. The draft declaration makes an important\r\nbeginning in this direction and, notwithstanding the\r\nobservations we have made in a spirit of constructive\r\ncriticism, we would like to express our appreciation to all\r\nthose who contributed to the subject. But, as we have\r\nlaboured to argue, UNESCO can ill afford to neglect its\r\ncore competence in the field of science, education, culture\r\nand ideas in the creation of a culture of peace in deference\r\nto the attractions of diplomacy.\r\nIn this context, we would like to signal our particular\r\nappreciation of the contribution of Nobel Peace laureates\r\nin introducing the idea of non-violence to the heart of the\r\nculture of peace through a detailed programme of\r\neducation of children in non-violence, and to the\r\ndelegation of Bangladesh for piloting the draft resolution\r\non the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and\r\nNon-violence in the Economic and Social Council. It is\r\nour conviction that, properly targeted, a culture of peace\r\ncan attack, if not eliminate, the roots of war in the human\r\nmind.\r\nMr. Erwa (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic): The\r\nUnited Nations was founded after the indescribable\r\ndestruction and human suffering of the Second World\r\nWar, which claimed millions of victims and dispersed\r\nhundreds of thousands of refugees. The United Nations\r\nembodied the hope of a final end to humanity’s suffering.\r\nFifty years later, the United Nations has achieved\r\ngreat successes on many fronts and strives for more. It\r\nhas not, however, lived up to the expectations and\r\naspirations of many members of the international\r\ncommunity. We are compelled to wonder why. We\r\nbelieve that the answer lies in the fact that the principal\r\norgans of the United Nations have remained, to a large\r\nextent, tools for trends in a specific culture and\r\ncivilization whose representatives try to impose their\r\nvalues in all political, economic and social areas. In this\r\ncontext, my delegation understands and appreciates the\r\nimportance of the concept of a culture of peace, which\r\nthe General Assembly has been considering for two years.\r\nThe delegation of Sudan pays tribute to the\r\nenormous role played by the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in the\r\npromotion of a culture of peace. Ever since UNESCO\r\nconvened the International Congress on Peace in the\r\nMinds of Men in Côte d’Ivoire in July 1989, we have\r\nfollowed that role and carried out various activities at all\r\nlevels to consolidate the culture of peace.\r\nAt the national level, the Government of Sudan, a\r\ncountry that has been roiled by uprisings ever since it\r\nachieved independence, is fully aware of the political,\r\nsocial and economic effects of promoting the culture of\r\npeace. In this respect, my country has established close\r\ncooperation with UNESCO. In cooperation with\r\nUNESCO, we convened two symposiums in 1995 and\r\n1996 to encourage the process of peace and national\r\ndialogue in Sudan. Paragraph 38 of the report on this item\r\n(A/53/370) emphasizes this cooperation.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nI wish briefly to describe the efforts being made by\r\nmy country to restore peace. The peace process began with\r\nthe convening of a conference on a peace dialogue a few\r\nmonths after the formation of the Government of National\r\nSalvation. A group of Sudanese leaders in the fields of\r\npolitics and culture across the political and religious\r\nspectrums took part in the Conference to consider the\r\nstrategy for achieving peace in our country. The conference\r\nindicated the need to hasten the establishment of peace\r\nthrough negotiations with the other parties. Consequently,\r\nthe delegates departed from the conference heralding the\r\narrival of peace, extending the olive branch and explaining\r\nto all neighbouring countries and to some other African and\r\nEuropean States, all the steps taken by the Government of\r\nSudan.\r\nWe began rounds of intensive dialogue in Frankfurt,\r\nNairobi and Addis Ababa. These were followed by the\r\nwell-known talks in Nigeria, known as Abuja I and Abuja\r\nII in 1992 and 1993 respectively, and then once again in\r\nNairobi. Efforts made did not aim solely at those who bore\r\narms abroad, for another movement was taking place\r\ninternally in the country, namely, the campaign from within\r\nfor peace by the people of Sudan. This movement aimed,\r\nfirst and foremost, at convincing the internal group of the\r\nnecessity of peace and stability as a guarantee of peace for\r\nfuture generations and as a means to attain progress,\r\ndevelopment and reconstruction. Intensive programmes\r\nwere implemented aimed at the people in the regions\r\naffected by war in southern Sudan and in southern\r\nKordofan. These programmes emphasized awareness and\r\nthe need to respect the culture of citizens and their\r\nreligions. They also stressed that citizenship is the basis of\r\nequality in Sudan. This principle was later enshrined in the\r\nSudanese Constitution adopted at the beginning of this year.\r\nConsequently, these gigantic efforts bore fruit in the\r\nconclusion in April 1997 of the Khartoum Peace Accords,\r\nwith seven factions from the main insurgency movement.\r\nThese Accords had been preceded by the signing of a\r\ncharter for peace in April 1996 in order to build trust\r\nbetween the parties. The leaders and the members of these\r\nfactions came out of the forests and of the clutch of\r\ninsurrection and during the course of a year were totally\r\nassured of the Government’s serious intention to consolidate\r\nthe culture of peace in Sudan. Then, on 21 April 1997, they\r\nvoluntarily went to the Presidential Palace to sign the\r\nAccords which guarantee them all their rights and stress\r\ntheir duties.\r\nThe Khartoum Peace Accords stressed the following.\r\nSudan is a multiracial, multicultural and multireligious\r\ncountry with freedom of religious belief and freedom to\r\nadvocate religion. No one is to be persecuted on the basis\r\nof religious orientation. The Accords stressed respect for\r\nthe dignity of the person, the independence of the\r\njudiciary, and the sharing of Sudan’s wealth and power\r\ndistribution within one State. These points were provided\r\nfor in the Peace Accords. The adoption of all these\r\nprinciples and the application of all these steps were in\r\nessence the consolidation of the principles of the culture\r\nof peace in Sudan in word and deed. The statements of\r\napprobation by all the officials and the representatives of\r\nthe United Nations who visited Sudan testify to this. Mr.\r\nFederico Mayor, Director-General of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), visited Khartoum and noted that the ideas\r\nwhich he always advocated were indeed being applied.\r\nThe communications revolution, which surpasses the\r\nconcept of distance, offers an historic opportunity to\r\npromote the concept of a culture of peace as a\r\nreplacement for the culture of domination and aggression.\r\nIndeed, the recent military aggression against the\r\npharmaceutical and veterinary establishment in my\r\ncountry by the United States is the best testimony to the\r\nculture of war. It is now high time to eradicate that\r\nculture from the minds of men. In this lies the challenge\r\nto the United Nations to renew its commitment under its\r\nmain mandate “to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war” and to save them from all those\r\npreaching the culture of war.\r\nIn this respect, the delegation of Sudan wishes to\r\npay tribute to the draft declaration on a culture of peace,\r\nwhich emphasizes, among other things, advancing\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and solidarity among all peoples\r\nand thereby celebrating cultural diversity. The draft\r\ndeclaration also emphasizes that each nation is rich in its\r\nown traditions and values and has much to contribute and\r\nmuch to gain from the promotion of a culture of peace.\r\nMs. Topić (Bosnia and Herzegovina): It is an\r\nhonour and privilege to address the fifty-third session of\r\nthe General Assembly on the agenda item 31, entitled\r\n“Culture of peace”.\r\nThe delegation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is very\r\npleased that, in accordance with resolution 52/13, which\r\nmy delegation had joined in sponsoring, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in coordination with the Director-General of\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), has submitted to the Assembly\r\nat the current session a consolidated report containing a\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\ndraft declaration and programme of action on a culture of\r\npeace. Our delegation expresses its deep appreciation for\r\nthis report, which is a result of the common efforts of\r\nGovernments and the people of the world.\r\nIt was only three years ago that Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina was in flames, a country where the policy of\r\nethnic cleansing and the indiscriminate shelling of civilians\r\nwere taking their toll in flagrant violation of the most basic\r\nof all human rights — the right to life. Today, slowly but\r\nsteadily, peace is taking hold and the implementation of the\r\npeace plan is having a gradual, positive impact. This\r\npositive impact gives us strength and inspiration for further\r\nefforts and increases our hope for a peaceful, multi-ethnic,\r\ndemocratic, prosperous and united country.\r\nHaving such memories of our country’s past, building\r\na society which integrates tolerance, peace and love is our\r\nhighest priority, since we know very well that only full\r\nrespect for all human rights, including civil, political,\r\ncultural, economic and religious rights, leads towards the\r\nvision of the society of the new millennium — a society of\r\ntolerance and peace. Furthermore, we are witnessing the\r\nend of a century and of a millennium of great\r\nachievements, but at the same time a century and a\r\nmillennium of two world wars and millions of innocent\r\nvictims.\r\nTherefore, my delegation strongly supports the\r\nrecommendations in the consolidated report, hoping that\r\nsuch action-oriented vision will contribute to the global\r\nspread of a culture of peace, a world without violence and\r\na world of democracy. We also support those goals to\r\nenable our participation in the efforts of the global\r\ncommunity to build a more just society in order to spare\r\nthe children and future generations from the fears of war —\r\nfears already inscribed in the childhood of the youngest in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Our hopes are that those fears will\r\nbe replaced with the awareness and comfort of a culture of\r\npeace.\r\nIn resolution 52/15 the General Assembly has declared\r\nthe year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of\r\nPeace, and therefore we would like to propose the\r\nintegration of the positive spirit of the culture of peace as\r\nan overarching theme of the Millennium Assembly.\r\nBeing pleased that the consolidated report reflects the\r\nactivities relating to a culture of peace undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations, in particular by UNESCO in various parts\r\nof the world, allow me to express my delegation’s gratitude\r\nfor UNESCO’s tireless efforts in the reconstruction of a\r\nnumber of cultural and religious monuments in my\r\ncountry, including the bridge in Mostar.\r\nFor all these reasons, my delegation sincerely\r\nsupports the adoption of programme of action on a culture\r\nof peace.\r\nMr. Guillén (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nWe are very honoured to note how the topic we had the\r\nprivilege of introducing in 1995, at the fiftieth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, has evolved. Today we see an\r\nintegrated plan perfectly consistent with resolution 52/13,\r\nadopted by consensus at the last session of the General\r\nAssembly. We believe the draft declaration on a culture\r\nof peace, its aims and strategies and the specific actions\r\nthat can be taken at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels are entirely consistent with what the\r\nGeneral Assembly has called for. We also believe that the\r\ndraft declaration is quite relevant.\r\nThe post-cold-war period has presented many\r\nchallenges — with the unexpected emergence of various\r\nkinds of internal conflicts, ethnic issues, nationalist\r\nconflicts and xenophobic reactions — that have often\r\nstretched the Organization beyond its limits. However,\r\nvery specific objectives have also emerged, and they have\r\nbeen consistently reaffirmed in this Organization. Respect\r\nfor human rights, the right to life, a redefinition of what\r\nconstitutes quality of life, a new appreciation of\r\ndemocracy and the numerous dimensions of freedom, the\r\nparticipation of civil society in decision-making, the\r\ncontribution of non-governmental organizations, the\r\nintrinsic importance of women’s situation and the needs\r\nof children are all part of a culture of peace.\r\nIn the meeting rooms of this Organization we\r\nproclaim with increasing urgency the pressing need for\r\ngreater progress in the areas of conventional disarmament,\r\nnon-proliferation, the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and the prohibition of nuclear testing. All\r\nthese engines of destruction originated in developed\r\ncountries, never in the poor countries. All of these\r\nproducts of the human mind are challenges to the creation\r\nof a culture of peace and an education for peace.\r\nBut the aims and specific actions contained in the\r\nreport and in the draft declaration and programme of\r\naction, which we have all studied, propose neither a\r\npolitical nor an onerous plan. They propose ideals, not\r\nillusions; but attainable ideals and actions that already\r\nexist. In essence, as set out under the heading “Aims and\r\nstrategies,” paragraph 2, a monitoring system is proposed,\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nbased on the catalytic role to be played by the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,\r\nparticularly through the Administrative Committee on\r\nCoordination. Specific measures are proposed, such as\r\neducational campaigns, school programmes and the use of\r\nschool textbooks in which hatred will not be taught and\r\nhistory will not be distorted. Thus, is it fully possible in a\r\nspecial way to better develop education for the prevention\r\nof conflicts and the action of regional centres not only for\r\nthe prevention of conflicts but also for the promotion of\r\ndisarmament and peace.\r\nThe Gorée island memorial project in Senegal received\r\nvery special mention in the statement of the representative\r\nof Bangladesh. We believe that project will be very dear to\r\nPeru, its culture and cultural interrelationships and all the\r\nbloodlines of the Peruvian nationality.\r\nWe believe that fostering reconciliation, including the\r\nideal of forgiving and forgetting, is a part of all the ideas\r\nwe are expressing here.\r\nIn our view, there are two very important points to\r\nconsider at this session of the Assembly. The first is to\r\nhave a clear awareness of the great possibility of\r\ndeveloping a culture of peace and education for peace\r\nthrough the mass media. The second is to take action and\r\ntake a decision during this session of the Assembly.\r\nFinally, we believe that nothing could be more\r\nimportant or more relevant for the United Nations than to\r\nhave this item inscribed on the agenda of the Millennium\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with the\r\ndecision taken earlier, I call on the Observer of the Holy\r\nSee.\r\nArchbishop Martino (Holy See): The unanimous\r\ndecision of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session\r\nto proclaim the year 2000 as the International Year for the\r\nCulture of Peace is a fitting beginning to a new millennium\r\nin which a culture of war and of violent solutions to\r\nconflicts may finally give way to a culture of peace. For\r\nthis to become a reality, however, the peoples of the world\r\nmust learn to live together on the basis of the universal\r\nvalues of peace.\r\nPeace is far more than the absence of war and\r\nviolence. Peace requires the establishment of social\r\nconditions in which the inherent dignity and the inalienable\r\nrights of all members of the human family are recognized.\r\nThis, according to the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, is the very foundation of freedom, justice and\r\npeace in the world.\r\nIn his historic encyclical letter Pacem in Terris,\r\nPope John XXIII, in 1963, conceived of universal peace\r\nas resting on four pillars: truth, justice, liberty and a\r\nsolidarity based on disinterested love for the other. In this\r\nbrief statement, my delegation wishes to address one of\r\nthese points, that of the relationship between truth and\r\npeace.\r\nThe truth of the human person is, in the first place,\r\nthe inherent and inalienable dignity and worth of each and\r\nevery person, without exception. Where there is no\r\nconcrete expression of this fundamental truth, an authentic\r\nculture of peace is impossible. While discrimination on\r\nthe basis of racial origin seems to have decreased in many\r\nparts of the world, more subtle forms of discrimination,\r\nrelated to ethnic or national origin or religious belief,\r\ncontinue to fuel harsh conflicts.\r\nIn his most recent encyclical letter, Fides et Ratio,\r\nPope John Paul II singled out the peaceful coexistence of\r\ndifferent races and cultures as one of the most pressing\r\nissues facing humanity today, an issue that must be faced\r\nin a spirit of open dialogue and collaboration. The\r\npossibility of true peace is based on such a spirit.\r\nIt is possible to construct a renewed society and to\r\nsolve the complex problems that the world faces today\r\nonly upon the basis of the transcendent truth of the\r\nhuman person. In the political sphere, this includes\r\novercoming all forms of totalitarianism, which, even after\r\nthe fall of the Iron Curtain, continues to destroy the\r\nfreedom of persons or groups. Totalitarianism, in any of\r\nits multiple forms, denies the dignity of each person,\r\ntransforming persons and groups from the subjects of\r\nrights into objects to be used. There is, in fact, an\r\ninseparable connection between truth and freedom.\r\nEveryone has a right, and indeed a duty, to\r\ncontribute to the building of a just and peaceful society.\r\nThis becomes impossible when certain minority groups\r\nare excluded because of national origin or religion. Nor\r\nis it sufficient that the presence of such diverse groups be\r\nsimply tolerated. Their active participation in civil society\r\nmust be promoted and assured.\r\nTruth is also the necessary condition for the\r\nrebuilding of a society after violent struggles have set\r\ngroup against group, people against people. The very\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\neffort of former opponents to come together and seek a\r\nsolution to conflict is a significant step towards peace.\r\nIn his message on the 1997 World Day of Peace, Pope\r\nJohn Paul II pointed out the necessity of adopting a new\r\nattitude in order to re-examine the past. We must learn to\r\nread the history of other peoples without bias, striving to\r\nunderstand the point of view of the other. Our very\r\nacceptance of the opportunity to reread this history together\r\nwill make it easier to accept and appreciate the legitimate\r\ndifferences between individuals, groups and peoples.\r\nTruth also means recognizing things for what they\r\ntruly are: hatred is hatred, murder is murder and massacres\r\nare massacres. Political or ideological motives and\r\nmanipulations cannot serve as an excuse not to recognize\r\nthese things.\r\nTruth also demands the fulfilment of the requirements\r\nof justice. Recently, there have been significant examples\r\nof efforts to establish the truth, and with it justice,\r\nregarding acts of violence, massacres, terrorism and even\r\ngenocide. The long and painful process of reconciliation\r\ncan begin only when the truth has been established. New\r\nseeds of conflict are sown when this truth is obscured or\r\nvengeance dominates.\r\nTruth must also be the guiding principle in the\r\ntransmission of information, be it through the media or in\r\nall levels of education. Violence flourishes in lies and\r\nactually needs lies to continue to rage. A distortion of the\r\nculture, identity and specificity of other persons or groups\r\ncan foster attitudes that reject that which is different and\r\nbuild up a false sense of superiority, even of hatred and\r\nfear. Such attitudes are destructive of a culture of peace.\r\nThe media have a special responsibility to\r\ncommunicate what is happening in today’s world with the\r\ngreatest objectivity possible, and to reject sensationalism,\r\nwhich can actually heighten tensions and\r\nmisunderstandings. The educator — and the first educator\r\nis the family — also has the responsibility to form young\r\npeople, from their earliest age, to appreciate and understand\r\nthe culture and history of other peoples and see in them a\r\nsource of mutual enrichment.\r\nThe pursuit of truth is actually the quest for peace. To\r\nseek truth together is perhaps one of the most solid and\r\nstable foundations for it. As Pope John Paul II stated in\r\nFides et Ratio,\r\n“To believe it possible to know a universally\r\nvalid truth is no way to encourage intolerance; on\r\nthe contrary, it is the essential condition for sincere\r\nand authentic dialogue between persons. On this\r\nbasis alone is it possible to overcome divisions”.\r\nOn the eve of the year 2000, the Holy See joins the\r\nfamily of nations in contributing to building a peace\r\nwhich, in accordance with the Charter of the United\r\nNations, is aimed at developing friendly relations among\r\nnations, achieving international cooperation in solving\r\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian problems and\r\nharmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of\r\ncommon ends. This is the foundation of the culture of\r\npeace so many people long for. It is the responsibility of\r\nall States and all peoples to find the political will and\r\ndetermination to realize that peace together.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/53/L.25, entitled “International Decade for a\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of the\r\nWorld (2001-2010)”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/53/L.25?\r\nDraft resolution A/53/L.25 was adopted (resolution\r\n53/25).\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right\r\nof reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second and should\r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): It is regrettable that in\r\ntoday’s discussion of such a lofty, far-reaching and\r\nuniversal goal as the promotion of the culture of peace,\r\nthis Assembly was subjected to inappropriate and\r\ninaccurate remarks specifically directed against my\r\ncountry by the representatives of Lebanon and Syria. I\r\nwould therefore like to take this opportunity, in keeping\r\nwith the spirit of the present discussion on the culture of\r\npeace, to clarify my country’s position with regard to the\r\nachievement of a peaceful resolution of the differences\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nbetween Israel and Lebanon, which we hope will be\r\nattained at the earliest possible opportunity.\r\nLet me assure my Lebanese colleague that Israel has\r\nno aspirations regarding Lebanon other than the\r\nachievement of peace. We have designs neither on\r\nLebanese sovereign territory nor on its natural resources.\r\nIsrael seeks only to establish a future of lasting and secure\r\npeace for ourselves and our children, as I hope Lebanon\r\ndoes also. Unfortunately, however, there are organizations\r\noperating within Lebanon that have used and continue to\r\nuse Lebanese territory to launch indiscriminate terrorist\r\nattacks against Israel and its citizens — men, women and\r\nchildren alike.\r\nTerrorist infiltrations and bombardments have caused\r\nloss of life and limb, extensive material damage and untold\r\ntrauma to the schoolchildren of northern Israel. Those\r\nchildren must spend long hours, and sometimes many days,\r\nin concrete bomb shelters, huddled in fearful anticipation of\r\nthe next mortar bomb or rocket salvo sent screeching over\r\nIsrael’s northern border to explode in the streets and houses\r\nabove them. It is for their sake that it is incumbent upon\r\nboth of us to redouble our efforts to inculcate and develop\r\nthe culture of peace between us.\r\nIn order to further that objective, Israel has stated on\r\nmany occasions that it stands ready to fully implement the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) within\r\na framework that will ensure the implementation of all its\r\nelements, including its stated goals of restoring international\r\npeace and security and assisting the Government of\r\nLebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority.\r\nHowever, until such satisfactory arrangements are made,\r\nIsrael will have no choice but to exercise its right of self-\r\ndefence in order to protect civilian lives from the terrorist\r\naggression directed against it and emanating from Lebanese\r\nterritory.\r\nIn the wake of the recent signing of the of the\r\npromising Wye River Memorandum between Israel and the\r\nPalestinians, and in the midst of this discussion of the\r\nculture of peace, now would be a most opportune time to\r\ncall upon our Lebanese neighbours to engage in\r\nconstructive discussions on the establishment of those\r\nnecessary security arrangements in southern Lebanon as an\r\nimportant first step in the full implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978) and at the same time to re-\r\nengage in the direct peace negotiations on both the\r\nLebanese track and the Syrian track — talks initiated in\r\nMadrid in October 1991, which, unfortunately, have been\r\nsuspended for some time.\r\nRegarding the negotiations, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to remind my Syrian colleague that those\r\nground-breaking talks were convened in Madrid on the\r\nbasis of the Madrid invitation, which was accepted by all\r\nsides, including Israel and Syria. That document, which\r\nconstitutes the foundation of the present Middle East\r\npeace process, clearly states that these negotiations are\r\ntaking place on the basis of Security Council resolutions\r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Consequently, a statement to\r\nthe effect that my Government has rejected resolutions\r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and, for that matter, 425\r\n(1978), is misleading, inaccurate and unfortunate.\r\nWe urge our Syrian neighbours to re-engage with us\r\nin these direct, bilateral peace negotiations on the basis of\r\nthe agreed-upon Madrid formula, with no prior conditions,\r\nso that we may together achieve that peace which has\r\nevaded us for so long.\r\nMr. Najem (Lebanon) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI am puzzled by the comments of the representative of the\r\nIsraeli occupation forces. In my statement this morning,\r\nI referred to two clear issues. The first was Israel’s theft\r\nof Lebanese territory — a fact that is officially\r\nacknowledged by the Israeli Government. Secondly, I\r\nreferred to an incident that took place in April 1996,\r\nwhen the Israeli occupation forces bombarded Qana and\r\nkilled 106 innocent civilians. At that time the Secretary-\r\nGeneral dispatched an investigator to the area, Major-\r\nGeneral Van Kappen, whose report can be studied in\r\ndocument S/1996/337. That document, like others,\r\ncondemns the forces of the Israeli occupation.\r\nWith regard to the baseless claims of the\r\nrepresentative of the Israeli occupation forces, I would\r\nlike to say that our experience is that the occupation\r\nforces do not believe in laws, values or human rights. I\r\nwill provide some facts — although they are not\r\nexhaustive — by way of example. The Israeli occupation\r\nforces deliberately perpetrated a horrible massacre in the\r\ntown of Qana that claimed the lives of 106 innocent\r\ncivilians, including women, children and old men who, in\r\nthe United Nations compound in the town, were taking\r\nrefuge from the Israeli aggression called “Operation\r\nGrapes of Wrath”, launched against civilians in the\r\nLebanese town of Qana. This is the town in Galilee\r\nreferred to in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ\r\nperformed his first miracle by transforming water into\r\nwine. The holiness of that site means nothing to the\r\noccupation forces, which systematically seek to destroy\r\nour values, our civilization, and whatever is sacred to us.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nFurthermore, they violated the sanctity of the United\r\nNations premises that house the messengers of peace.\r\nAre those the values defended by the representative of\r\nthe forces of occupation? By what logic did he want us not\r\nto mention the fact that the occupation forces brought life\r\nto a standstill in southern Lebanon through their repeated\r\ndaily bombardment of peaceful villages, disrupting the\r\ncourse of daily life and closing schools down? The right to\r\neducation, the right to security and the right to peace are\r\namong basic human rights. The occupation forces try to\r\nundermine such rights on a daily basis in southern Lebanon,\r\nbut to no avail.\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power since 1972, rejects the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978),\r\nwhich demanded its immediate and unconditional\r\nwithdrawal from Lebanon. Is the forcible acquisition of the\r\nterritory of others also a human right? The forces of\r\noccupation have engaged in various forms of warfare\r\nagainst my country, at times by bombardment using all\r\nkinds of weapons, and at other times by invasion, in an\r\nattempt to impose their brand of peace and their terms upon\r\nLebanon. They have not succeeded, nor will they ever\r\nsucceed, for Lebanon will not tolerate Israeli occupation of\r\nits land. The peace in which Lebanon believes is peace\r\nbased on resolutions of international legitimacy, especially\r\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978), and on the principle\r\nof land for peace.\r\nThere is another matter. We have heard the\r\nrepresentative of the occupying Power attack honourable\r\npeople who are fighting the Israeli occupation of southern\r\nLebanon, branding them as “terrorists” because they resist\r\nand reject subjugation by the forces of Israeli occupation\r\nand cling to freedom and to the liberation of Lebanon from\r\nthis villainy. Does the representative of the occupying\r\nPower think that the world is blind to its aggression with\r\nlethal weapons of devastation against Lebanon and its\r\nsovereignty, and to its criminal intentions, in violation of\r\nLebanon’s independence and sovereignty and stubbornly\r\nignoring all resolutions of international legitimacy? What\r\nthe representative of the occupying Power calls “terrorism”\r\nis in fact nothing less than valiant resistance against\r\noccupying armies. Resistance to foreign occupation is a\r\nlegitimate right guaranteed by all norms of international\r\nlaw. This valiant resistance to occupation will continue\r\nunabated, parallel with the full range of diplomatic\r\nendeavours, until the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978), which calls for the immediate and\r\nunconditional withdrawal of the forces of occupation from\r\nLebanese territory to the internationally recognized\r\nboundaries.\r\nAs for the claim by the representative of the\r\noccupying Power that his State desires to implement\r\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978), this is but one\r\nmore lie in its attempts to mislead world public opinion\r\nand divert its attention from the crimes Israel perpetrates\r\ndaily there. If the occupying Power truly wishes to\r\nimplement Security Council resolution 425 (1978), the\r\nsole way to that end is very clear: immediate,\r\nunconditional withdrawal to the internationally recognized\r\nboundaries, as stipulated in that resolution.\r\nIsrael’s conditions for withdrawal constitute a blatant\r\nattempt to evade its obligations and to prolong its\r\noccupation, in line with its true intentions of expansion\r\nand aggression. Israel did not seek permission to occupy\r\nsouthern Lebanon; it should also depart without\r\npermission.\r\nWe had every right to speak of the suffering of our\r\npeople under occupation by speaking of Israeli practices.\r\nIndeed, it is the duty of everyone in this international\r\nforum to know the facts and to be aware of the suffering\r\nof peoples. On the basis of the Charter and its provisions,\r\nand as our expression of confidence in the representatives\r\nof the world’s States gathered in this Hall, whom we have\r\nknown to reject categorically the practices and the\r\nbrutality of occupation, my delegation exercised its right\r\nto make clear the true suffering of its people, no more\r\nand no less.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation\r\nfrom Arabic): The delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic\r\nwas not surprised by the Israeli delegation’s response to\r\nour statement, in which, like all other delegations, we\r\nspoke of the meaning of peace and of a culture of peace.\r\nThis is because neither the Israeli delegation nor the\r\nGovernment of Israel believes in peace or in a culture of\r\npeace. We believe that the most dangerous enemies of a\r\nculture of peace are those who pretend that they believe\r\nin a culture of peace while actually murdering that\r\nculture.\r\nHow much would I have liked to be able to speak\r\ntoday about the establishment of a just peace in the\r\nMiddle East, about respect for and the implementation of\r\nUnited Nations resolutions on the Middle East, about the\r\nsuccess of the Madrid peace process. But unfortunately,\r\nthe region still stands on the brink of disaster because the\r\npresent Israeli Government has reneged on its\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\ncommitment to the bases of peace and to the peace process,\r\nhas refused to implement United Nations resolutions and\r\nhas defaulted on agreements concluded in the context of the\r\nMadrid peace process.\r\nThe millions of displaced persons, the tears of\r\nPalestinian, Lebanese and Syrian children in the occupied\r\nPalestinian, Lebanese and Syrian territories, and the\r\nsuffering of our peoples as a result of Israeli occupation all\r\ncall out to the conscience of the world to support the peace\r\nprocess and to apply the culture and the principles of peace.\r\nBut international efforts have invariably collided with\r\nIsraeli policies rejecting withdrawal from the occupied Arab\r\nterritories and the establishment of a comprehensive, just\r\npeace in the Middle East, based on Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and on\r\nthe principle of land for peace. That was the basis on which\r\nthe Madrid Conference on peace in the Middle East was\r\nconvened.\r\nMore than one delegation has said today that it would\r\nbe a grave mistake to view a culture of peace as nothing\r\nbut rhetoric. All speakers have called upon States to\r\ncommit themselves to a culture of peace, and especially to\r\nthe implementation of its principles — in particular,\r\ntackling the root causes of the problems that lead to war\r\nand violence. Is there any greater threat to a culture of\r\npeace than the occupation of the lands of others for more\r\nthan 30 years, or the displacement of millions of women,\r\nchildren and old people — which is what Israel has\r\nperpetrated? Is there a greater threat to peace and a culture\r\nof peace than Israel’s continued murder of Arabs and the\r\nbuild-up of its devastating military arsenal and capabilities,\r\nincluding nuclear weapons, or its rejection of declaring the\r\nregion of the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone, or\r\nits establishment of settlements throughout the occupied\r\nArab territories — even after the signing of the most recent\r\nagreement?\r\nDo the claims of the Israeli delegation embody a\r\nculture of peace? Or do those claims really reflect culture\r\nof war and the murder of the culture of peace?\r\nSyria opened the way to the Madrid peace process.\r\nAfter long and strenuous negotiations, peace was not far\r\naway. But the Israeli Government continues to this day to\r\nreject the resumption of the talks at the point at which they\r\nwere suspended. That is why the negotiations have been\r\nstalled for more than two and a half years.\r\nSyria affirms the need to resume negotiations from the\r\npoint where they stopped, in a manner that would guarantee\r\nthe legitimate and inalienable rights of Arabs to their\r\nterritories and establish an honourable, just and\r\ncomprehensive peace.\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): I believe it is clear to all\r\nmembers of the General Assembly that disagreements\r\nexist between Israel and Lebanon and Israel and Syria.\r\nYet we do have an agreed framework to work out our\r\ndifferences, the Madrid framework. The Madrid\r\nConference was convened in October 1991 and we were\r\nable to begin negotiations between us. Let us return to\r\nthose negotiations without prior conditions. We can work\r\nout our differences.\r\nMr. Mekdad (Syrian Arab Republic): As the\r\nAssembly can see, my delegation is not trying to prolong\r\nthis dialogue, but we would like to put before everyone\r\nthe truth and only the truth as it actually is. We believe\r\nin the principles of the Madrid peace process and in the\r\nbases from which it proceeded. We emphasize all the\r\nobligations and commitments made in the context of the\r\npeace process. But it is the current Israeli Government\r\nthat is placing conditions on the resumption of the peace\r\nprocess, because it wants to go back to square one in the\r\ntalks, and to eliminate all the achievements and\r\nagreements concluded during that difficult period that\r\nlasted for over two years.\r\nWe would like to affirm before the Assembly that\r\nSyria is ready to restart the peace process immediately\r\nfrom where it left off, and not on any basis that would\r\nsteer the process away from its genuine objective and the\r\nachievements it has already made. Any statements to the\r\ncontrary are but lies and baseless allegations that do not\r\nserve the cause of the peace process.\r\nMr. Najem (Lebanon): We must reply once again to\r\nthe representative of the occupying Power, Israel.\r\nResolution 425 (1978) is clear in both its content\r\nand its provisions. What the occupying forces need to do\r\nis to apply them, since the resolution calls for Israel’s\r\nimmediate withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese\r\nterritories.\r\nAs for all the other tracks, my delegation and my\r\nGovernment have declared that we are ready to resume\r\nnegotiations from where they ended. However, we see\r\nthat Israel did not respect its commitments under the\r\nMadrid peace process, which began in 1991. Israel also\r\ndid not respect Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\r\n338 (1973), 425 (1978) or the land-for-peace formula.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 55th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 10 November 1998\r\nWe have expressed our readiness for peace and for the\r\nresumption of negotiations from where they left off. This is\r\nvery clear and axiomatic. I only wanted to clarify what was\r\nsaid by the representative of the occupying Power.\r\nThe Acting President: I should now like to remind\r\nmembers that, as stated by the representative of Bangladesh\r\nat this morning’s meeting, an additional draft resolution\r\ncontaining a draft declaration and programme of action on\r\na culture of peace will be submitted at a later date.\r\nI would also like to congratulate Member States on\r\nthe adoption of the very important resolution entitled\r\n“International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nviolence for the Children of the World (2001-2010)”.\r\nHistory will record that this is perhaps the single most\r\nimportant decision the international community took in\r\nsecuring international peace, cooperation and development\r\nfor future generations. It represents a cultivation of this\r\nnew culture of peace at all levels of education, through all\r\nchannels of communication and involving all segments of\r\nsociety.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 31.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.\r\n20\r\n"
