(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Chkheidze\r\n(Georgia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 93 (continued)\r\nSustainable development and international economic\r\ncooperation\r\n(d) Renewal of the dialogue on strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership\r\nHigh-level dialogue on the theme of the social and\r\neconomic impact of globalization and\r\ninterdependence and their policy implications\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nPermanent Representative of Bangladesh.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): We have engaged\r\nourselves in a dialogue on the impact of globalization and\r\ninterdependence and their policy implications. The current\r\ninternational context provides an opportunity for serious\r\nreflection. We hope that the collective wisdom gained\r\nthrough our deliberations will lead to the adoption of policy\r\nmeasures which will create a world with much less\r\nuncertainty and upheaval than we have experienced to date.\r\nGlobalization and liberalization were at one time\r\npresented as universal panaceas of benefit to developed and\r\ndeveloping countries alike. It became quickly apparent\r\nthat their benefits did not come without costs. Soon, it\r\nwas realized that the cost was almost totally confined to\r\nthe majority of developing countries. The most vulnerable\r\ncountries stood to bear the major adverse impact.\r\nThe developing countries have been subjected to a\r\nseries of economic crises, ranging from debt crisis to\r\nfinancial crisis. This indicates that, for most of them, the\r\ncosts outweigh the benefits. The recent financial turmoil\r\nhas caused major economic difficulties in a large number\r\nof developing countries, while the industrialized countries\r\nhave been largely spared.\r\nIt is our major concern that, for most developing\r\ncountries, the economic reform measures that led to a\r\ngreater global integration did not diminish the gap\r\nbetween the rich and poor countries. Indeed, the disparity\r\nhas widened, both between countries and among the rich\r\nand poor within countries.\r\nAn important factor that has contributed to the\r\nfinancial turmoil is hasty economic liberalization. A large\r\nnumber of countries opened up their economies to rapid\r\ncapital influx. Their institutional development failed to\r\nkeep pace with the change. This gives us cause for\r\nreflection. Financial integration is a much more\r\ncomplicated process than trade liberalization.\r\nThe Assembly should seriously reflect on this vital\r\nissue as it considers financing for development. We\r\nshould emphasize the development of mature institutions,\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nincluding legal provisions, regulatory mechanisms and\r\ndevelopment of supervisory capacities. This should be\r\nsupported by an adequately responsive international\r\nfinancial regime capable of preventing such crises and\r\ncontaining their effects, including possible contagion across\r\ncountries and regions.\r\nThe weakest countries remain most vulnerable, due to\r\ntheir lack of financial and institutional capacity to handle\r\nsuch external shocks, the impact of which is magnified in\r\nthe current context of declining external assistance, falling\r\nofficial development assistance and unbearable debt burden.\r\nThe situation has been aggravated by declining commodity\r\nprices.\r\nThe impact of all this on the eradication of poverty\r\nwill be extremely damaging. The decline in primary\r\ncommodity prices will result in lower returns for producers\r\nand will greatly reduce their earnings. The most seriously\r\naffected countries will be the least developed. The fall in\r\nincome will seriously affect the ability of the Governments\r\nof the least developed countries to provide for relief and\r\nrehabilitation needs in the event of disaster. In certain\r\ncountries, the loss of exports will result in a loss of jobs, in\r\nparticular where there is a growing industrial sector\r\nemploying a large number of workers. Many of these\r\nindustries employ women. There will be a further\r\naccentuation of the feminization of poverty due to their loss\r\nof jobs.\r\nIt is important to have emergency action programmes\r\nto shield the weakest economies, particularly the least\r\ndeveloped countries, from the consequences of global\r\neconomic turbulence. The following broad components\r\nshould be considered on a priority basis: first, safety-net\r\nmeasures, including emergency assistance, such as food aid\r\nto support vulnerable segments of the population; secondly,\r\nbalance-of-payment supports to severely affected countries;\r\nthirdly, an immediate increase in the level of official\r\ndevelopment assistance; fourthly, a significant reduction of\r\nexternal debt on an urgent basis, while pursuing serious\r\nefforts at a decisive reduction of the debt burden of the\r\nleast developed countries; fifthly, compensatory measures\r\nto cover shortfalls in earnings from primary commodity\r\nexports and reduction in remittances; and, finally, the\r\nimmediate lifting of trade barriers affecting the least\r\ndeveloped countries. We need to formulate policy options\r\nto take care of these pressing priorities.\r\nThe doctrine of globalization has far-reaching\r\neconomic and social consequences for the developing\r\ncountries, particularly for the least developed. Emphasis on\r\nthe role of unfettered markets has displaced the key\r\nprinciple that underpinned earlier multilateral discussions\r\nand negotiations on economic issues. The costs have been\r\nprofound, but the benefits are difficult to rationalize. The\r\nvulnerable countries are ill-prepared to absorb the shocks\r\nof liberalization and are experiencing the pains of\r\nintegration. Genuine international development\r\ncooperation should be reinstated in justified earnestness\r\non the international development agenda.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nPermanent Representative of Senegal.\r\nMr. Ka (Senegal) (interpretation from French): By\r\nconvening, as a prelude to the general debate of the fifty-\r\nthird session, this high-level dialogue on the theme of the\r\nsocial and economic impact of globalization and\r\ninterdependence and their policy implications, we are\r\ncertainly addressing, in advance, one of the major issues\r\nto be raised at this session.\r\nEconomic and financial turmoil, as well as the risks\r\nof marginalization that accompany the globalization\r\nprocess, very clearly indicates that this phenomenon —\r\nabove and beyond its short-term dimension — deserves a\r\nlong term approach, both in our discussions and in the\r\ncollective joint action taken by the international\r\ncommunity. Indeed, in a world that has become a global\r\nvillage, the interdependence of economies is an objective\r\nfact, rendering obsolete any individual or selective\r\napproach to the challenges of globalization.\r\nGlobalization appears to be a process evolving along\r\nlines that stress two diverging trends — one bringing\r\nopportunity, the other rightly viewed with great\r\napprehension because of the dangers of marginalization\r\nand exclusion it poses to the large majority of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nBut because living with globalization is now a fact\r\nof life that no one can evade, we need to prepare\r\nourselves and to master this phenomenon. I believe that\r\nthis is the main interest of the exercise that has brought\r\nus here today: to seek, together, individual and collective\r\nresponses to the challenges of the international economic\r\nsystem.\r\nThe basic driving forces of this phenomenon are\r\nknown. They lie, inter alia, in the swift circulation of\r\ninformation; in the ongoing liberalization of factors of\r\nproduction; in the widespread tendency to deregulate\r\nnational economies; and in particular in the unprecedented\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nexpansion of multinational corporations supported by\r\nenormous private investment. Furthermore, we live in a\r\nworld where technological advances are increasingly\r\nreducing physical borders to their most basic form. Never\r\nin the history of humankind has the international system\r\nappeared so open and so integrated.\r\nThe adoption of the Marrakesh Agreement presaged\r\nthe advent of an era of prosperity wherein opportunities\r\nbrought about by the liberalization of trade and the\r\nestablishment of a multilateral trading system based on\r\ntransparency, predictability and the primacy of the rule of\r\nlaw were to guarantee all countries a clear improvement of\r\neconomic prospects.\r\nThe series of major international conferences held\r\nduring this decade also seemed to indicate that the\r\ninternational community would finally find in their various\r\nconsensus plans of action a common response to sustainable\r\ndevelopment patterns and that we could legitimately hope\r\nto stride confidently into the third millennium. Nevertheless,\r\nwhile everyone agrees about the expectations and the\r\nenormous potential of globalization, the facts prompt us\r\ntoday to take a more critical view of this phenomenon.\r\nGlobalization is still unknown in many developing\r\ncountries and is a source of apprehension, even a necessary\r\nevil. While these countries must share the risks of\r\nglobalization, the opportunities offered by globalization are\r\nnot shared equally. This is the case in the area of trade, for\r\nexample. Whereas opening up to the outside world is one\r\nof the basic principles of the new multilateral trading\r\nsystem, many tariff and non-tariff barriers continue to\r\nhamper access to external markets for the commodities of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn this connection, the 1998 report on the world\r\neconomic situation indicates that in a number of countries\r\nthe adjustments in foreign trade, far from increasing income\r\nand jobs, have, to the contrary, reduced them. The same\r\ngoes for the distribution of foreign private capital. In an\r\nenvironment marked by an unprecedented reduction in\r\nofficial development assistance, foreign private\r\ninvestments — 95 per cent of which are concentrated in a\r\nmere 26 countries — do not constitute, for all, a reliable\r\nway to stimulate sustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We might add other examples that are linked\r\nto the reduction of international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, such as the problem of debt and the failure to\r\nhonour financial commitments to implement the major\r\nplans of action that emerged from the international\r\nconferences held in this decade.\r\nWhile emphasizing the negative impacts of\r\nglobalization that have to do with the international\r\nenvironment, the delegation of Senegal would certainly\r\nnot wish to ignore the domestic side of our debate.\r\nIndeed, we are convinced that living with globalization\r\nand benefiting from the opportunities it brings means that\r\nthere must inevitably be an effort to adapt at the national\r\nlevel. Peace and political stability are indeed necessary\r\nconditions for this, but they are not enough. We must also\r\ndefine a competitive macroeconomic framework which is\r\nsound and transparent. We need to guarantee the primacy\r\nof the rule of law, simplify administrative procedures and\r\nmodernize the machinery of state, as well as\r\ntransportation and communication infrastructures. In short,\r\nwe need to forge a competitive mentality. It is in that\r\nspirit of competition that we need to maintain and\r\nstrengthen this approach.\r\nIn essence, however, between the disillusionments of\r\nthe welfare state and the obvious limits of market\r\nmechanisms, the response to the challenges of\r\nglobalization might be to try to look for some middle\r\nground which simultaneously combines the power of\r\npublic service and the vitality of the private sector. Given\r\nthe changes taking place and the questioning of society’s\r\ntraditional regulatory mechanisms, there is no doubt that\r\nin the crucial areas of combating poverty, protecting the\r\nmost vulnerable sectors of our populations and providing\r\nbasic social services, the historic role of the State remains\r\nmore indispensable than ever. It seems to us that the\r\nconsolidation of the process of integration at the regional\r\nand subregional levels through the creation and\r\nstrengthening of major economic systems offers a credible\r\nsolution, given the small size of many national markets.\r\nIt must be stated once again that in order for these\r\nefforts to be productive and effective they need to be\r\nbacked up at the international level by concrete measures\r\naimed at restoring the balance of trade, achieving a\r\nlasting global solution to the debt crisis and increasing\r\nofficial development assistance.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to emphasize\r\nthe example of Africa. I believe that it is important to\r\nchange our perception of that continent, a perception\r\nconsisting of misleading clichés that reduce Africa to a\r\nmere zone of conflicts and humanitarian relief. That\r\nsimplistic vision of things is sure to maintain confusion\r\nabout Africa and to make investors nervous. It is high\r\ntime we created a more accurate view of African realities\r\nby drawing attention to what I would call the “peaceful\r\nmajority” of African States, which are politically stable\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nand economically credible in view of the major advances\r\nthey have made and their new prospects for participating in\r\nthe worldwide trade in ideas, goods and services.\r\nIn order for that new Africa to be a part of economic\r\nglobalization it needs a more humane approach towards\r\nglobalization, with the education of its peoples, the\r\npromotion of certain values of justice and solidarity and the\r\ngrowth of its development potential. It is by helping\r\ndeveloping countries — in particular those in Africa —\r\nconnect to the developed world’s network of prosperity and\r\nopportunity that the future of our planet will be firmly and\r\ndefinitively secured.\r\nThat is the whole point of our debate and the basic\r\nreason underlying our deliberations on renewing the\r\ndialogue on strengthening international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nPermanent Representative of Pakistan.\r\nMr. Kamal (Pakistan): Allow me to congratulate\r\nMr. Opertti on his election as the President of the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly. This unanimous election\r\nis a recognition of the important role that Uruguay has\r\nplayed in the United Nations. It is also an expression of the\r\nconfidence that the Members of the United Nations have in\r\nhis abilities.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to thank his\r\npredecessor for his effective leadership during the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly and for the role he played\r\nin organizing this high-level dialogue.\r\nI should like to fully associate myself with the\r\nstatement made by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia,\r\nMr. Ali Alatas, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe live in an increasingly interdependent world. Our\r\ninterdependence is increasing through international legally\r\nbinding commitments, the adoption of policies reaching\r\nacross national borders, enhanced trade and financial flows,\r\nand markets which have become fully integrated on a\r\nglobal scale.\r\nWhile this financial integration has resulted in a\r\ndramatic increase in private investment flows, it has also\r\ncompounded economic vulnerabilities. The succession and\r\nspread of crises in the past year have highlighted the\r\nvolatility of such flows as well as the serious liquidity\r\nproblems that can emerge from such volatile finances.\r\nHowever, there have been undeniable positive effects\r\nof globalization and liberalization, manifest in the\r\nremarkable growth in trade and investment flows in recent\r\nyears. A number of developing countries have achieved\r\nper capita incomes closer to those in the developed\r\ncountries. But these opportunities have been accompanied\r\nby serious challenges for developing countries.\r\nWe have seen the downside of globalization. First,\r\nthe increased trade and investment flows witnessed in\r\nrecent years have bypassed the majority of the developing\r\ncountries. Secondly, the prosperity of those who\r\napparently benefited from these phenomena has proved to\r\nbe fragile. Thirdly, globalization has been accompanied\r\nby an accentuation of income disparities among and\r\nwithin countries, with obvious negative implications for\r\nthe welfare of large segments of our populations.\r\nFourthly, the market forces unleashed by globalization\r\nhave not helped the developing countries in their efforts\r\nat integration into the world economy. And fifthly and\r\nfinally, integration into global markets has exacted a very\r\nheavy cost, especially since there are no adequate safety\r\nnets for countries faced with economic difficulties.\r\nThe accumulation of the side effects of globalization\r\ncould lead to a new set of class divisions: divisions\r\nbetween those who prosper in the globalized economy\r\nand those who do not; divisions between those who share\r\nits values and those who would rather not; divisions\r\nbetween those who can diversify its risks and those who\r\ncannot. This is not a pleasant prospect, even for those\r\nwho are on the winning side of the globalization divide.\r\nThe deepening of social and economic fissures will harm\r\nus all.\r\nHalting or reversing globalization is both unrealistic\r\nand undesirable. Yet globalization is not a take-it-or-\r\nleave-it phenomenon. It can be managed to serve the\r\ninterests of all. However, as a result of globalization and\r\ngrowing interdependence, an increasing number of issues\r\ncannot be effectively addressed by countries individually.\r\nWe therefore need a global response to a global\r\nchallenge.\r\nThe challenge is twofold: first, the inclusion of\r\neveryone in the process of managing globalization; and\r\nsecondly, the maximization of benefits for everyone and\r\nthe minimization of the negative impact of globalization,\r\nparticularly on developing countries. To meet this\r\nchallenge, we need to evolve mechanisms, policies and\r\ninstitutions to manage globalization for the benefit of all.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nTo harness the potential of globalization, we were able\r\nto come up with an agreed Agenda for Development. It is\r\nnow time to launch a comprehensive dialogue to\r\noperationalize that Agenda. To ensure that the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment is not merely another addition to the United\r\nNations bookshelf, we should launch a global dialogue for\r\nglobal prosperity and well-being and build a partnership to\r\nprovide the means for the implementation of that Agenda.\r\nThere are certain priority areas that need urgent\r\nattention. First, priority should be given to strengthening the\r\ncapacity of multilateral institutions to address the issues of\r\ntrade, finance, and development in an integrated manner.\r\nSecondly, the institutions responsible for rule-making in the\r\nglobalization process, namely, the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the\r\nWorld Bank, should be made more democratic and more\r\ntransparent. Thirdly, a serious attempt must be made to\r\naddress the perennial issues of debt, access to technology,\r\nand development finance. Unless there is progress on these\r\nsystemic and fundamental equity issues, it is doubtful that\r\nany significant advance can be made to improve the social\r\nconditions of the majority of the world’s population. And\r\nfourthly, the rules regarding international trade must take\r\ninto account the great disparity in the ability of developing\r\nand developed countries to compete in global markets.\r\nOur collective efforts to evolve mechanisms and\r\npolicies to manage globalization cannot be delayed. Without\r\nsounding like a prophet of doom, we must note that we are\r\non the verge of a global economic crisis with serious social\r\nconsequences. We should therefore without delay initiate a\r\nserious dialogue to turn the tide of globalization to serve\r\nthe cause of development, peace and prosperity for all.\r\nTo initiate this dialogue at the earliest possible time,\r\nwe may consider convening a resumed session of the fifty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly at the ministerial\r\nlevel to address this issue.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Lee See-young (Republic of Korea): In view of\r\nthe recent international economic turmoil, today’s high-level\r\ndialogue on the theme of the social and economic impact of\r\nglobalization could not be more opportune. Indeed,\r\nglobalization has changed the world so profoundly that no\r\ncountry is immune to the events taking place in whichever\r\nregions of the globe, and financial turmoil, be it in East\r\nAsia or in Russia, can reverberate around the world. As\r\nglobalization has become a prevailing trend of the day, the\r\nworld needs to respond to it collectively to maximize its\r\nbenefits and minimize its risks and vagaries.\r\nOver the past two decades, many developing\r\ncountries have embraced the principles of a global market\r\neconomy. The end of the cold war also facilitated the\r\nintegration process of the world economy. In this process,\r\na global economy based on market forces has offered\r\nenormous potential. Furthermore, technological advances\r\nas well as increased trade and capital flows have opened\r\nthe door to new opportunities, especially for developing\r\ncountries. However, globalization and in particular the\r\nincreasing role of private capital flows now pose new\r\nchallenges for developing countries. The risk of\r\nmarginalization is all too real for many of those countries,\r\nespecially for the least developed countries and many sub-\r\nSaharan African countries.\r\nThese profound changes necessitate a new paradigm\r\nfor international development cooperation. We believe\r\nthat today’s high-level dialogue can contribute greatly to\r\nthe ongoing efforts of the international community in its\r\nsearch for a new partnership for development.\r\nFinancial integration is one of the key features of\r\nglobalization. Indeed, since the Asian financial crisis\r\nstarted in July last year, the issue has loomed constantly\r\nin our minds as a reminder of the risks and dangers of the\r\nglobalization process. It is true that the most affected\r\ncountries were once regarded as development success\r\nstories, showing few outward signs of economic\r\ndisequilibrium until this recent crisis. However, we are\r\nnow faced with the necessity to re-examine the promises\r\nheld out by financial liberalization and the adequacy of\r\nthe international financial architecture. Despite the\r\nsobering experience of the Asian financial crisis, global\r\nfinancial integration seems an inevitable aspect for\r\ndeveloping countries in their participation in the\r\nglobalization process.\r\nThe Asian financial crisis has taught us many\r\nlessons. A certain number of preconditions are necessary\r\nfor a country to withstand the disruptions and to enjoy the\r\nbenefits of open capital markets. They include a sound\r\ninstitutional framework, a well-regulated banking system\r\nand efficient capital markets. Moreover, a consensus view\r\nis emerging that the liberalization of capital markets\r\nshould be approached in a prudent and orderly manner.\r\nThe need to strengthen the present international\r\nfinancial system is another lesson highlighted by the\r\nAsian crisis. More effective monitoring of international\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\ncapital flows and the development of an efficient early-\r\nwarning system should be given serious consideration. It\r\nwould be useful if the international community took into\r\nconsideration the vulnerability of emerging markets to\r\nvolatile and aggressive international capital flows. It may\r\ntake a conscious and collective effort to keep emerging\r\nmarkets from falling prey to the contagion effects of this\r\ncrisis.\r\nThe Republic of Korea, strongly affected by the\r\ncurrent crisis, is a case in point of the benefits,\r\nopportunities and dangers of globalization. Indeed, despite\r\nthe enormous economic and social difficulties currently\r\nfacing it, the Republic of Korea continues to pursue the\r\nprocess of globalization. It, however, requires wise\r\neconomic policies, a proper institutional framework and\r\ngood governance. The crisis has compelled my Government\r\nto reform the structure of its economy. Our economic\r\nreform includes liberalizing our financial markets,\r\noverhauling the prudential regulatory system, restructuring\r\ncorporate governance and increasing the transparency of all\r\nsectors of the Korean economy. To this effect, many drastic\r\npolicy measures have already been introduced and are being\r\nimplemented.\r\nThe key philosophy, long espoused by President Kim\r\nDae Jung, is that democracy and free market principles are\r\ninseparable. This philosophy is behind all these reform\r\nmeasures, and my Government is determined to continue\r\nthe economic reforms this year with a view to establishing\r\na sound basis for durable recovery and restoring full\r\neconomic stability by 1999.\r\nOne of the most beneficial aspects of globalization has\r\nbeen its contribution to the eradication of poverty in many\r\ndeveloping countries through economic growth. In fact, the\r\nliving standards of important segments of the population\r\nhave quadrupled in a single generation. Nevertheless,\r\nquestions remain regarding whether market-driven\r\nglobalization has not left many people behind. The income\r\ngap between rich and poor within societies and between\r\ncountries is widening. This trend poses, not only a moral\r\nquestion, but also political and economic questions as to the\r\nviability of the globalization process.\r\nGovernments need to formulate policies that will\r\npermit broader segments of their population to benefit from\r\nglobalization. This can be done through increasing\r\ninvestments directed at basic education, social services and\r\ncritical infrastructure. The Asian crisis has revealed many\r\nof these social concerns to be true. In most cases, the\r\nhardest hit by the crisis were also the most vulnerable\r\nsegments of the population: women, children and the\r\npoor. Without proper social safety nets in place, human\r\nsuffering can reach devastating levels. A more daunting\r\naspect of this crisis is the real danger that the progress\r\nmany of these countries have achieved in poverty\r\nreduction could be undone. Economic readjustment\r\nprogrammes must recognize the needs of the poor.\r\nMoreover, long-term development objectives must never\r\nbe forgotten.\r\nThe economic crisis in my country has brought on\r\nsevere social consequences, notably a sharp increase in\r\nunemployment. In implementing structural reform, my\r\nGovernment is making every effort to ensure fair burden-\r\nsharing among all members of society, crucial in\r\nmobilizing public support for the reform process. The\r\nTripartite Committee — made up of business, labour and\r\nGovernment representatives — is an important vehicle for\r\nachieving this goal. Also, my Government is now\r\nexpanding the country’s social safety net to protect the\r\npoor, as well as newly displaced workers.\r\nRecently, the emphasis on the market has\r\novershadowed the importance of the State and its policies.\r\nWhile the role and function of a State is evolving in an\r\never changing international political and economic\r\nenvironment, it still plays an important role in shaping the\r\ndevelopment of society. Sound public policy is more\r\ncrucial than ever in determining the economic capacities\r\nand benefits societies will reap in this globalized system.\r\nMoreover, coherence and harmony between the market\r\nand the State are fundamental in coping with the\r\nchallenges globalization represents. This implies that a\r\nState, while ensuring fair, transparent and rule-based\r\nenvironments for efficiently functioning markets, must\r\nalso be capable of providing prudential supervision over\r\nmarket excesses and protecting its population as a whole.\r\nThe same logic that is applied to the role of the\r\nState can also be applied to the international community\r\nin meeting the challenges of development in the era of\r\nglobalization. Now, more than ever, strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation and partnership for development,\r\nbased on mutual benefit and shared responsibility, is\r\nessential to safely steer our economies towards economic\r\nprosperity and social betterment for all.\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to inform\r\nMembers that we still have 26 speakers inscribed on the\r\nlist. In order to allow the Assembly to hear the remaining\r\nspeakers, I again appeal to the Member States to\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\ncooperate with the understanding that their statements\r\nshould not exceed seven minutes.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of Jamaica.\r\nMiss Durrant (Jamaica): The high-level dialogue that\r\nbegins today represents an important step in the\r\nstrengthening of international cooperation. My delegation is\r\nconfident that frank and open exchanges over these two\r\ndays will yield positive results as we seek to explore the\r\nsocial and economic impact of globalization and\r\ninterdependence and their policy implications.\r\nI wish to associate my delegation with the statement\r\nmade by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nNo country represented here has been exempt from the\r\neffects of globalization, whether positive or negative. That\r\nthe United Nations has accorded priority to discussing this\r\nissue is significant, as the Organization has a pivotal role to\r\nplay in stimulating and strengthening international\r\ncooperation and partnerships. Indeed, the reality of\r\ninterdependence dictates collaboration and the adoption of\r\na multilateral approach that takes account of the interests of\r\nall States.\r\nGlobalization has emerged as the dominant economic\r\ntheme of this decade. It is not a new phenomenon. In his\r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/53/1), the\r\nSecretary-General alludes to the fact that interconnected\r\nactivities on a worldwide scale have existed for centuries,\r\nbut that globalization as seen in its contemporary form is\r\nnew. We have witnessed the expansion of economic\r\nactivities across national boundaries and the deepening of\r\neconomic integration, increasing economic openness and\r\ngrowing economic interdependence between countries in the\r\nworld economy. We have also witnessed the rapid\r\ndevelopment and spread of technology, information, ideas\r\nand movement of people across national boundaries.\r\nThe trends in the globalization process have presented\r\nopportunities for some developing countries which have\r\nserved to accelerate their rates of development and\r\nexpanded their options. These relate mainly to the lowering\r\nof barriers to world trade, the increasing mobility of\r\ntransnational corporations, the decentralization of\r\nproduction processes and access to capital markets.\r\nThe globalization process has had both positive and\r\nnegative effects on developing countries. Growth and\r\nexpansion have taken place in some countries, but in others\r\nthere has been deterioration and marginalization. Income\r\ndisparities have increased both among and within\r\ncountries, unemployment has worsened in many countries\r\nand the gap between developing countries as a whole and\r\nthe developed countries has increased rapidly in recent\r\nyears. The stark reality is that the benefits of globalization\r\nare uneven in their spread.\r\nWe in the Caribbean recognize the importance of the\r\nprocess of globalization, but remain concerned about the\r\ngrowing trend towards protectionism, which has affected\r\nthe levels of market access in goods and services. Market\r\naccess, for us and for many other developing countries, is\r\none of the most fundamental components of international\r\ntrade. This remains crucial for the economic development\r\nof small economies whose vulnerabilities are intensified\r\nby our limited access to markets, narrow resource base,\r\nsmall size, inadequate levels of human resource\r\ndevelopment and proneness to natural disasters.\r\nThe effects of globalization go far beyond the\r\neconomic implications. Many developing countries have\r\nwitnessed the perpetuation of poverty and human\r\ndegradation. My delegation agrees that with the greater\r\nreliance on and dominance of market forces, coupled with\r\neconomic structural adjustment programmes, safety nets\r\nat the national and community levels have been eroded\r\nalong with the provision of basic social services. This has\r\ncontributed to the increased vulnerability of the\r\ndisadvantaged. We also agree that globalization must be\r\nsocially responsible and must have a human face.\r\nThe 1998 Human Development Report states that\r\nhuman development should be incorporated into the\r\nmainstream of the global development debate and that\r\nthere should be a humanization of development priorities.\r\nThe report also notes that despite economic difficulties,\r\nthe world has more than enough resources to accelerate\r\nprogress in human development for all and to eradicate\r\nthe worst forms of poverty. Advancing human\r\ndevelopment is not an exorbitant undertaking.\r\nGlobalization should therefore seek to focus on the human\r\nand social dimensions in order to make the playing field\r\nmore level than it is at present. The continued\r\nmarginalization of some countries will serve only to\r\nintensify poverty and widen the existing gaps.\r\nHow, then, should we address the social and\r\neconomic impacts of the globalization process? We must\r\nrealize that participation in the global economy demands\r\nthat we take stock of the realities of the current\r\ninternational situation and also recognize that the trend\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\ntowards global interconnection is irreversible. We must\r\ntherefore seek to strengthen international cooperation in the\r\nareas of trade, market access and finance and to encourage\r\nthe wider dispersion of capital flows, including access to\r\nprivate financial markets.\r\nWe must encourage more socially responsible\r\nglobalization which is based on agreed norms and standards\r\nwhich protect the rights of the individual. We must invest\r\nin the development of human resources through education\r\nwhich is geared towards a knowledge-based economy. We\r\nmust also seek to remove inequalities of access to\r\ninformation and information technology which prevent\r\ndeveloping countries from realizing their comparative\r\nadvantages and their full integration into the world\r\neconomic system.\r\nWe should examine the architecture of the\r\ninternational financial institutions in order to promote the\r\nmonitoring of capital flows, especially short-term flows, so\r\nas to reduce the vulnerability of developing countries to the\r\neffects of volatile flows. We should also seek to ensure that\r\nthere is greater flexibility in the application of policies by\r\nthese international institutions and greater sensitivity to the\r\nneeds of developing countries. We have to ensure that there\r\nare adequate levels of technical and financial support to\r\nenable countries to adapt and adjust to the current global\r\nsituation.\r\nFinally, we must make globalization work in favour of\r\nsustained economic growth and better income distribution\r\nin order to achieve sustainable development for all our\r\npeoples.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan): Allow me, on behalf\r\nof the delegation of Kazakhstan, to congratulate Mr. Opertti\r\non his election and to express our conviction that under his\r\nwise leadership the high-level dialogue on the socio-\r\neconomic impact of globalization, and the entire work of\r\nthe session, will proceed fruitfully and productively.\r\nIn a situation of ever increasing interrelatedness of the\r\nworld economic system and of open borders, the process of\r\nglobalization that is apparent in all spheres of inter-State\r\nrelations among States Members of the United Nations\r\nexercises an enormous influence on national State systems.\r\nGlobalization is becoming one of the key factors in the\r\ndevelopment of today’s world. In this connection, great\r\nimportance attaches, in our view, to the need to strengthen\r\nnormative, legislative and organizational frameworks in\r\norder to ensure the stability and predictability of the\r\nworld economy. The Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nwork of the Organization rightly points out, inter alia,\r\nthat globalization has an immense potential to improve\r\npeople’s lives, but that at the same time it can also have\r\na negative impact. An example of this has been the lack\r\nof regulation of financial markets at the global level,\r\nwhich has led to considerable socio-economic costs not\r\nonly in Asia but also in the Russian Federation and other\r\ncountries of the world.\r\nThe process of shaping the international trade\r\nsystem, begun 50 years ago on the initiative of the United\r\nNations, has made an unprecedented contribution to\r\ninternational economic growth. An important phase of the\r\ndevelopment of international trading relations was the\r\nUruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations.\r\nAt the same time, despite the progress achieved in\r\nthis area, direct and indirect tariff barriers continue to be\r\nmaintained which affect a considerable number of goods,\r\nsome of which are important export items for the\r\ndeveloping countries. In this connection, there is in our\r\nview a need for further multilateral efforts under United\r\nNations auspices, including the continuation of dialogue\r\nbetween the participants in trade relations, and joint\r\nactivity by United Nations agencies, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization to ensure\r\nfurther liberalization in the sphere of international trade in\r\nconjunction with the need to increase technical assistance\r\nto developing countries.\r\nThe strengthening of international cooperation within\r\nthe United Nations on economic and social issues is of\r\nvital importance to Kazakhstan, above all because of our\r\ncountry’s geopolitical situation in the centre of the\r\nEurasian continent and in a region with extensive reserves\r\nof mineral raw materials and hydrocarbons. In the course\r\nof Kazakhstan’s seven years of independence, the system\r\nof economic and social relations within the country has\r\ntotally changed. Macroeconomic stabilization of the\r\neconomy has had a positive effect on investment activity.\r\nThere has been an increase in production. The\r\nGovernment attaches priority to developing an export-\r\noriented industrial complex. Kazakhstan is paying great\r\nattention to issues of attracting and making effective use\r\nof what is one of the most important forms of foreign\r\ncapital at the current stage: that which enters the country\r\nthrough official development assistance. In this context,\r\ncooperation is being developed with a whole series of\r\ninternational financial and economic organizations.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nKazakhstan is actively preparing to join the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe strategy for the development of Kazakhstan to the\r\nyear 2030, proposed by President Nursultan Nazarbaev in\r\nhis message to the people of our country, states that one of\r\nthe long-term priorities for the development of the republic\r\nis economic growth based on the development of a market\r\neconomy. Kazakhstan’s main objective in the external\r\neconomic sphere is to achieve rapid inclusion in world trade\r\nrelations, entry into the world markets in goods, services\r\nand capital, and utilization of the advantages of the\r\ninternational division of labour. In this context, the joint\r\nactivities of the United Nations with other multilateral\r\norganizations, aimed at promoting the more effective and\r\njust functioning of the world economy, is of vital\r\nimportance to us, as it is to other countries with economies\r\nin transition.\r\nThe Republic of Kazakhstan, which occupies a vast\r\nterritory of almost 3 million square kilometres and which is\r\nlocated at a crossroads in the Eurasian region, attaches\r\nexceptional importance to solving the problem of access to\r\ninternational trade routes, and, in cooperation with the rest\r\nof the international community, is taking appropriate steps\r\nin that direction. Of special significance to our country are\r\nquestions of the development of transport infrastructure in\r\nthe region of Central Asia. Kazakhstan greatly appreciates\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies and programmes, particularly the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development and the United\r\nNations Development Programme, to develop the transit\r\nand transport system in the landlocked States of Central\r\nAsia.\r\nAn important role in creating favourable conditions for\r\nthe socio-economic development of States is being played\r\nby regional economic organizations. In this connection, our\r\ncountry attaches great importance to the United Nations\r\nspecial programme for the economies of Central Asia\r\ndeveloped by the Economic Commission for Europe and\r\nthe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific, the purpose of which is to assist the States of\r\nCentral Asia in increasing their mutual cooperation,\r\nstimulating economic development and becoming integrated\r\ninto the economies of European and Asian countries.\r\nFor the purpose of forming a single economic space in\r\nthe territory of three Central Asian States — Kazakhstan,\r\nKyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan — a programme of joint action\r\nhas been adopted which provides for harmonization of\r\nnational legislation, the creation of a free-trade zone and the\r\nsolution of problems of currency regulation and inter-bank\r\nregulations.\r\nKazakhstan is a member of the regional Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (ECO). For Kazakhstan, which\r\nwill be acting as Chairman of that organization for the\r\nnext two years, the activities of the ECO are of great\r\nimportance. The Almaty Declaration and the other\r\ndocuments adopted at the fifth summit of the ECO, held\r\nat Almaty in May 1998, are facilitating the further\r\nintensification of cooperation between the States members\r\nof the ECO and the creation of a favourable trading\r\nclimate for the development of links with European and\r\nAsian countries.\r\nKazakhstan is implementing a policy aimed at\r\nexpanding the organization of trade and economic\r\ncooperation with the countries of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States. The interim agreement on trade and\r\nrelated issues signed between Kazakhstan and the\r\nEuropean Union has made it possible to strengthen\r\neconomic ties with European States.\r\nIn his statement at the nineteenth special session of\r\nthe General Assembly, the President of Kazakhstan,\r\nNursultan Nazarbaev, particularly emphasized that\r\n“Because of the globalization of international\r\nrelations, it has become necessary to reject old\r\nstereotypes, technocratic approaches and attempts to\r\nachieve economic growth at any cost. It is therefore\r\nvery important to adhere strictly to the principles of\r\nthe Rio Declaration, ensuring that economic growth\r\ntakes place only in relationship to processes of social\r\ndevelopment and environmental security”.\r\n(A/S-19/PV.1, p. 24)\r\nDespite the objective economic difficulties, whose\r\nsolution requires the concentration of considerable State\r\nresources and efforts, the Government of Kazakhstan is\r\nnevertheless making an effort to conduct domestic\r\neconomic activity on the basis of the careful and rational\r\nutilization of nature, incorporating environmental-\r\nprotection requirements into its economic policy. At the\r\nState level, Kazakhstan recognizes environmental security\r\nas one of the strategic components of national security.\r\nProgrammes have been developed in Kazakhstan to\r\nrehabilitate the dried-up Aral Sea and the former\r\nSemipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, and projects for the\r\ncontrol of air pollution are being drawn up.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nGlobalization emphasizes the integrated nature of\r\ncontemporary world processes. We are convinced that in\r\nthe conditions of a mutually interdependent world, no\r\nproblem can be approached only from the standpoint of the\r\ninterests of any one State. In view of the importance of\r\nthese processes, we support international efforts aimed at\r\nensuring progress, well-being and security for all, and we\r\nwelcome the leading role of the United Nations in solving\r\nthe problems we are considering.\r\nThe Acting President: I call next on the\r\nrepresentative of Kenya.\r\nMr. Mahugu (Kenya): The leader of the Kenya\r\ndelegation will at the appropriate time convey to Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti his warm congratulations on his election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nNevertheless, I thank him for presiding over this important\r\nhigh-level dialogue on strengthening international economic\r\ncooperation for development through partnership. Kenya\r\nfully supports the timely decision of the General Assembly\r\nto convene this two-day high-level dialogue on\r\nstrengthening international economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership in accordance with its\r\nresolutions 48/165, 49/95, 50/122, 51/174 and 52/186. I also\r\nwish to thank the Deputy Secretary-General for her useful\r\nopening remarks.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the views\r\nexpressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China on this important\r\nitem before the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.\r\nWe recognize that growing globalization coupled with\r\nthe liberalization of the world economy has increased the\r\nimportance of international cooperation in the achievement\r\nof rapid and sustainable development. It is a fact that most\r\ndeveloping countries, including Kenya, are still inadequately\r\nprepared to cope with this process. Whilst we acknowledge\r\nthat a truly global economy was presented as the most\r\npromising means of spreading the benefits of globalization\r\nand liberalization, we observe that it has not lowered the\r\ntide of ever-increasing poverty in the world. It is therefore\r\nimportant that every possible effort be made at every level\r\nto help create a positive partnership geared towards the\r\neradication of poverty in the developing countries.\r\nTherefore, deliberate international cooperation efforts\r\nshould be targeted to ensure that the benefits of\r\nglobalization are shared equitably. Without such concerted\r\nefforts, the marginalization of weak and poor developing\r\ncountries will intensify.\r\nExternal indebtedness continues to be a major\r\nobstacle to the development of Africa and the least\r\ndeveloped countries. Various debt-relief measures put in\r\nplace have not gone far enough to overcome this obstacle.\r\nKenya therefore attaches great importance to the urgent\r\nneed for the implementation of effective, equitable,\r\ndevelopment-oriented and durable solutions to the external\r\ndebt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries,\r\nin particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries,\r\nand to help them to exit from the rescheduling process.\r\nWe also strongly call for the fulfilment of the\r\ninternationally agreed official development assistance\r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent and the provision of new and\r\nadditional resources for the development of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe United Nations occupies a unique position for\r\ndealing with the challenges of promoting development in\r\nthe context of the globalization of the world economy and\r\ndeepening interdependence among nations. It must\r\ncontinue to play a central, more effective and efficient\r\nrole in promoting and strengthening international\r\neconomic cooperation for development and in providing\r\npolicy guidance on global development issues. The United\r\nNations has convened a number of major global\r\nconferences on critical development issues. Fulfilling the\r\ngoals and commitments reached at these international\r\nconferences, particularly on international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, is essential, particularly in providing open,\r\nequitable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading\r\nsystems, as well as in providing a framework for\r\ninvestment, technology transfer and finance.\r\nAt a subregional level, Kenya, in close collaboration\r\nwith neighbouring countries, has embarked upon the\r\nrevival of the East African cooperation arrangement, the\r\nestablishment of which will contribute towards the\r\nintegration of the African Economic Community.\r\nIn conclusion, Kenya firmly believes that the\r\nexisting and future North-South and South-South\r\ncooperation frameworks constitute an important element\r\nof international cooperation for development and are an\r\nessential basis for ensuring the effective integration and\r\nparticipation of developing countries in mechanisms\r\ngoverning the management of the world economy. In this\r\ncontext, we call for the creation of more positive models\r\nwhich are responsive to the needs of developing countries\r\nwhile promoting cooperation for development through\r\npartnership.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nPermanent Representative of China.\r\nMr. Qin Huasun (China) (interpretation from\r\nChinese): The world economy today is beset with\r\nturbulence and unpredictability. This evolving phenomenon\r\nhas become the focus of attention of the international\r\ncommunity. Therefore, this high-level dialogue at the\r\nUnited Nations, the most representative of all\r\nintergovernmental organizations, to discuss the opportunities\r\nand challenges brought about by economic globalization is\r\nnot only timely, but also highly necessary.\r\nThe globalization of the world economy is a basic\r\nfeature of the world’s current economic development. It is\r\nalso an irreversible trend of economic development,\r\nindependent of any single will. The world today is open.\r\nNo country can develop its own economy in isolation from\r\nthe rest of the world. Only by taking the initiative in the\r\nlight of its own national conditions and adapting itself to\r\nthe trend of economic globalization can any country grasp\r\nthis historic opportunity and realize its economic and social\r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nAt the same time, we must not fail to recognize that,\r\nalong with opportunity, economic globalization also brings\r\nsevere challenges that can have serious adverse\r\nconsequences. This is even more true for the vast number\r\nof developing countries that are at a disadvantage in the\r\nglobal competition spearheaded by advanced science and\r\ntechnology. If they do not address such problems properly\r\nand strive to reap the benefits while avoiding the adverse\r\nconsequences, their development endeavours will be\r\nhampered by various restraints and the wealth they have\r\naccumulated soon eroded.\r\nThe financial crisis in some Asian countries has once\r\nagain confronted us with this harsh reality. The economic\r\nand social damage of the crisis to the hard-hit developing\r\ncountries is immeasurable, and the crisis still refuses to go\r\naway. The most important task before us now is to help\r\nthese countries rise from the crisis and resume healthy\r\neconomic and social development. China has been making\r\nand will continue to make its important contribution in this\r\nregard. We have actively participated in the assistance\r\nprogrammes of international financial institutions for the\r\ncountries hit by the crisis.\r\nWith a view to contributing to the stabilization of the\r\nsituation in the region and to the creation of conditions\r\nconducive to the affected countries’ return to the path of\r\ndevelopment, we have made the commitment not to devalue\r\nour own currency. For the same reason, we have also\r\ndecided to maintain a relatively high rate of growth. At\r\nthe same time, it must be emphasized that the impact of\r\nthe Asian financial crisis is global and will require the\r\nconcerted efforts of the world community fully to\r\neliminate its consequences. Major developed countries\r\nwith significant influence on the economy of the Asian\r\nregion, in particular, should take constructive policy\r\nmeasures as early as possible so as to make their due\r\ncontribution to stabilizing the situation and rejuvenating\r\nthe economy of the region.\r\nThe Asian financial crisis should lead us to a better\r\nunderstanding of the overall situation. It requires of us a\r\nclearer recognition of the potential adverse effects of\r\neconomic globalization and of the challenges it poses to\r\nour national economic security. Only by reflecting deeply\r\nand formulating relevant countermeasures can we avoid\r\nsimilar tragedies in the future.\r\nFirst of all, the world is diversified. Countries differ\r\ngreatly in their specific national conditions, levels of\r\ndevelopment and many other areas. In the process of\r\nintegrating into the global economy, countries cannot\r\npossibly follow one uniform model of reform and opening\r\nup. Only by proceeding from its own national conditions\r\nand priorities can a country be sure of enjoying sound\r\neconomic growth, social stability and prosperity. This\r\nfundamental principle should be understood and followed,\r\nnot only by countries in the process of reform and\r\nopening up, but also by the whole international\r\ncommunity.\r\nSecondly, a country’s domestic reform and opening\r\nto the outside world should complement each other and\r\nproceed in a gradual and orderly manner. It is a long\r\nprocess that cannot be finished at one stroke. We have a\r\ndeep knowledge of this from our experience. Over the\r\npast 20 years or so, since the introduction of the policy of\r\nreform and opening up, our reform aimed at establishing\r\na market economy has been progressing in various fields.\r\nThe new macro-control system is taking shape and the\r\nrole of the market as the basis for resource allocation has\r\nbeen greatly strengthened. It is our view that the opening\r\nup in various fields should be implemented at different\r\nlevels and with different priorities, and should proceed\r\nstep by step, so as to inject vitality into the process of\r\neconomic and social development. At the same time,\r\ncaution should be exercised and new problems solved\r\nthrough the constant deepening and improvement of\r\nreform and opening up.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nThirdly, economic globalization is interdependence in\r\nthe real sense of the term. Since problems spread rapidly,\r\nlike a contagion, a crisis at one spot may, more often than\r\nnot, trigger turbulence throughout a region or even around\r\nthe globe. Misfortunes suffered by any one country or\r\nregion may well expand to engulf other countries and\r\nregions. In the tide of economic globalization, the\r\nsustainable development of the world economy cannot be\r\nachieved without deeper and wider international\r\ncooperation. The execution of responsible economic and\r\nfinancial policies by the developed countries is essential and\r\nshould be made an important component of new\r\ninternational economic cooperation.\r\nLastly, it should be emphasized that developing\r\ncountries are striving to join the process of economic\r\nglobalization from a position of disadvantage and under\r\nunequal conditions. With a weak capacity to withstand the\r\nhazards in the financial and other fields, they need\r\nmeaningful international support. At present, inequality still\r\nexists in international economic relations. The new rules of\r\nthe game in the international economic, trade,\r\nenvironmental and other fields have not reflected the\r\ninterests of developing countries in an equitable manner.\r\nThe gap between developing and developed countries has\r\nnot shown signs of narrowing, and some developing\r\ncountries are in real danger of being marginalized in the\r\nglobalization process.\r\nTherefore, in formulating the so-called new rules of\r\nthe game, efforts should be made to guarantee the effective\r\nparticipation of the developing countries, and sufficient\r\nconsideration should be given to their specific problems.\r\nFinancial, technical and other kinds of assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries should be strengthened so as to boost\r\ntheir capacity-building. There is no lack of consensus in the\r\ninternational community in this regard. What is essential\r\nnow is the political will to honour the commitments already\r\nmade. The developed countries are fully capable of\r\nhonouring their commitments, and they should play their\r\nproper role towards this end.\r\nThe widespread and far-reaching impacts of economic\r\nglobalization do not stop at national or regional borders.\r\nConsequently, there are new and even higher demands on\r\ninternational cooperation. Benefits can be attained and harm\r\navoided only through international cooperation based on\r\nmutual dependence and partnership. This is the only way to\r\nachieve the ultimate goal of common development for all\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Thailand.\r\nMr. Jayanama (Thailand): This is not a speech but\r\na portrayal of the present financial system seen through\r\nthe eyes of those in a tango dance contest.\r\nConsider the following scenario of a tango dance\r\ncontest. Many pairs of dancers are doing the tango, a\r\ndance which requires good coordination and\r\nsynchronization between the two partners. Suddenly, in\r\nthe middle of the dance, one dancer falls, in part because\r\nshe was not a good dancer, in part because her partner\r\ndid not lead well and in part because the dance floor is\r\nslippery and uneven. As she falls, she nudges another\r\ndancer, who also falls, and now a number of dancers are\r\nstumbling and falling. The male partners, instead of trying\r\nto support their partners, decide to abandon them, now\r\nthat they have no hope of winning the dance competition.\r\nThe manager of the dance floor, who has also been\r\nappointed judge of the contest by the seven most\r\ninfluential spectators, tries to help but does not have much\r\nsuccess — perhaps because he is not knowledgeable\r\nenough about the art of dancing the tango, or perhaps\r\nbecause he has not been provided with enough resources\r\nto be effective.\r\nWhat is happening in this scenario to those involved\r\nin the dance-hall debacle? The first to fall has admitted\r\nunashamedly her lack of training in the tango and is now\r\ntrying her best to improve her skills in the hope that one\r\nday a new partner, or perhaps even her old partner, will\r\ninvite her to dance the tango on that floor again. The cost\r\nof training has been prohibitive and has badly affected her\r\noverall well-being, but she has obediently followed the\r\nadvice given to her by the dance-floor manager.\r\nThe lead, or male, partners, after realizing that many\r\nof their female partners are not very skilled in the art of\r\nthe tango, have deserted them and are trying to find new\r\npartners, even though not long ago these abandoned\r\npartners were chosen for their excellent skills in dancing\r\nthe tango.\r\nThe judge and manager of the dance floor, in spite\r\nof many years of experience, is baffled by this crisis on\r\nthe dance floor and often fails to give the right advice to\r\nthe fallen dancers. He tries, nevertheless, to help them by\r\noffering assistance, in return for which they are to mend\r\ntheir ways in a Draconian manner. And as the dance-hall\r\ndebacle worsens, his attempts to increase resources from\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nthe seven most influential owners of the dance hall also\r\nfails.\r\nWhat are the policy implications of this scenario?\r\nFirst, it is clear that the usual call from the seven most\r\ninfluential owners and from the floor manager for the\r\nunskilled dancers to admit their mistakes and to try to\r\nimprove their skills has not been enough. The dancers have\r\nalready been doing this for the past 14 months. Therefore,\r\nmore is needed, especially from the lead dancers. They\r\nmust be more rational in choosing partners and must get rid\r\nof their herd mentality.\r\nSecondly, the condition of the dance floor is also\r\nimportant. It must be a level playing field, with no holes or\r\nslippery spots. The floor must be the same for every dancer\r\nin order to give a fair chance to both partners and to all\r\npairs of dancers.\r\nThirdly, the influential shareholders of the dance hall,\r\nparticularly the seven most influential, must also do\r\nsomething more drastic. Otherwise the dancers will abandon\r\ntheir dance hall.\r\nFourthly, the dance-floor manager also has an\r\nimportant role in this respect. First and foremost, he must\r\nbe transparent, disciplined and impartial. He should not\r\nblame only one dancer for the fall, for it could have been\r\ncaused by numerous factors, including the lead tango\r\ndancer\u0027s tripping of his own partner. As of today, nothing\r\nhas really been done to improve the condition of the dance\r\nfloor, and nothing has been done to inculcate a sense of\r\nresponsibility in the lead dancers. Furthermore, not much\r\nhas been done to enhance the ability of the manager to deal\r\nwith the crisis.\r\nFifthly, the seven most influential owners of the dance\r\nhall have not come forward to take vigorous action, but\r\nhave largely remained spectators of this dance debacle. In\r\nfact, six of the seven have even prevented the seventh from\r\nsetting up a special school to help train the unskilled East\r\nAsian dancers. They have, in the last few days, issued some\r\nstatements about the bad state of the dance floor, but it\r\nremains to be seen who will rectify the situation.\r\nSo far, nothing has really changed in the last 14\r\nmonths. Some of the abandoned dancers have done their\r\nbest to adjust and to improve themselves at great economic\r\nand social cost to their families and are awaiting new\r\npartners. Another has decided to do the tango alone, thus\r\nmaking a mockery of the saying that it takes two to tango.\r\nAnother has continued to dance again with her partner but,\r\nat the same time, is ready to punish him severely if she\r\nfeels he is taking advantage of her.\r\nIt has often been said that globalization presents both\r\nopportunities and challenges. So far, our story of this\r\ntango debacle shows that it has been a case of\r\nopportunities for the strong and challenges for the\r\nweak on an unlevel playing field, with those who can\r\neffectively influence the course of events still watching on\r\nthe sidelines. Perhaps they will soon do something, now\r\nthat the chickens are coming home to roost.\r\nFinally, we — the good and faithful students of the\r\ndance-floor manager — are still waiting for a new partner\r\nto invite us to the dance once more, but it has been like\r\nwaiting, waiting and waiting for Godot.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Algeria.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (interpretation from French): I\r\nshould like at the outset to express my satisfaction at\r\nseeing Mr. Didier Opertti preside over this high-level\r\nintergovernmental meeting on the resumption of the\r\ndialogue on strengthening international economic\r\ncooperation for development through partnership, which,\r\nI hope, will provide us with new insight into ways of\r\npromoting international cooperation for development in\r\nthe context of globalization.\r\nBecause of the major political, economic and social\r\nchanges that the world is undergoing at the end of this\r\ncentury, today\u0027s meeting is clearly very significant and\r\ndeeply symbolic, as underscored by the statement made\r\nby Mr. Ali Alatas on behalf of the Group of 77 — a\r\nstatement we fully support.\r\nAt a time when economic interdependence among\r\nnations has become a generally recognized reality, and\r\nwith the complex problems facing the world economy\r\ngiving rise to increasing fears, it is crucial that dialogue\r\nresume and that a comprehensive approach to\r\ninternational economic cooperation be implemented. This\r\nis especially true because the world order that is being\r\nestablished on the basis of globalization is taking shape\r\nwithout those who were left out in the past. If we are not\r\ncareful, we will exclude even more countries, including\r\nsome that just a short time ago were being described as\r\nemerging economies. The stagnation now characteristic of\r\nfinancial markets, a stagnation that reveals the great\r\nimbalances in the global economy, should not, in spite of\r\nthe heavy burdens and responsibilities weighing on the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\ninternational financial institutions, serve as a pretext for the\r\nlatter and those that finance them to evade their\r\nresponsibilities towards the developing countries.\r\nThe magnitude of the generous financial and economic\r\nresources deployed, with exceptional speed and\r\neffectiveness, by the industrialized countries to come to the\r\nrescue of economies in distress is in stark contrast to the\r\nmeagre economic and financial assistance that those same\r\ncountries give to the countries of the South, and especially\r\nto the poorest among them, to help them emerge from their\r\nunderdevelopment. If not rapidly corrected, this trend could\r\neventually replace the East-West polarities of the past with\r\na new and very dangerous form of North-South\r\nconfrontation.\r\nYet many developing countries have courageously\r\nimplemented the economic and structural reforms that were\r\nexpected of them, often at a high social and political cost.\r\nBut these bold reforms, whose positive macroeconomic\r\nresults can already be measured, have rarely been\r\naccompanied by an improvement in the international\r\nenvironment and therefore have not allowed for a genuine\r\neconomic take-off.\r\nWorse yet, we are today witnessing a reversal of the\r\nsituation that is harmful to the developing countries. In fact,\r\nboth here in the United Nations and outside of it, the\r\ncountries of the North are requiring those of the South to\r\nteam their economic and social development efforts with\r\nrespect for human rights. This new demand — and\r\nunfortunately it is not the only one — can only promote\r\nconfrontation and wasted effort through behind-the-scenes\r\nsquabbling, to the detriment of international understanding\r\nand cooperation.\r\nFurthermore, the criticisms that continue to be levelled\r\nat the United Nations Industrial Development Organization\r\nhave been accompanied by a reneging on commitments\r\nundertaken with respect to technological transfers and\r\ntechnical assistance for the industrialization of the\r\ndeveloping countries. The role of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development is weakening, and\r\nthe countries of the North are steadily working to replace\r\nhumanitarian assistance with economic assistance. All of\r\nthese ingredients of future impasses could lead to a\r\nsituation in which obligations regarding international\r\ncooperation for development are evaded and the demands\r\nof the South ignored.\r\nMr. Filippi Balestra (San Marino), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe impasse regarding the question of the foreign\r\ndebt of most of the countries of the South; new forms of\r\ntrade and financial restrictions; the continued decline in\r\nterms of trade; and the disquieting decline in official\r\ndevelopment assistance, the only source of development\r\nfunding for many poor countries — these realities,\r\ncombined with the effects of the international financial\r\ncrisis, are characteristic of an international economic\r\nsystem that remains inequitable in its essence and its\r\nstructure.\r\nThe situation of the least-developed countries, in\r\nAfrica in particular, where hotbeds of poverty and misery\r\nand sources of social and political tension have\r\nproliferated, illustrate this perfectly.\r\nBy supporting the efforts of the countries of the\r\nSouth, the industrialized countries will not only contribute\r\nto promoting the progress of those countries and therefore\r\nto rooting out the sources of political and social instability\r\ntherein, but also will create good investment prospects\r\nand commercial and financial markets for their own\r\neconomies.\r\nToday the countries of the North must recognize that\r\nthe countries of the South are no longer the providers of\r\nraw materials that they used to be, and that they must\r\nnow be treated as partners and as players in the world\r\neconomy. In this spirit, the arsenal of measures contained\r\nin the Agenda for Development could relaunch this\r\ncooperation on a favourable and dynamic basis, to the\r\ngreater benefit of all the members of the international\r\ncommunity, and give new momentum to that cooperation.\r\nAlong those same lines, the convening of an international\r\nconference on development financing under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations could be a crucial step for the\r\ninternational community.\r\nShort-term trends in the international economy\r\nremain very uncertain. While the resumption of growth in\r\nthe industrialized countries — slight as it may be —\r\nwhich was supposed to serve as a driving force for that\r\nof the countries of the South, has been confirmed, that\r\ngrowth seems today to be held hostage to speculative\r\nmarkets and hasty and often inconsistent decision-making.\r\nIn different ways, the countries of South are also paying\r\na high price for these imbalances.\r\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from this situation,\r\nit is the revelation of how ill-adapted private capital\r\nmarkets are to serve as financing instruments for long-\r\nterm development. Future preventive measures in the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nframework of existing or proposed mechanisms to monitor\r\nthe global economy must be accompanied by a pitched\r\nbattle against speculative financial activities, which could\r\nvery rapidly bring to nought the longstanding efforts of\r\nmany countries.\r\nFurthermore, and in order fully to achieve their\r\nobjectives, the implementation of these mechanisms cannot\r\nbe dissociated from the need to promote greater\r\ninternational solidarity and a genuine democratization of the\r\ndecision-making bodies of the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nand more specifically the International Monetary Fund, in\r\norder to promote greater sensitivity to the constraints and\r\nconcerns of the developing countries.\r\nIn this rapidly changing world in which the\r\ndevelopment gap between North and South continues to\r\nwiden and in which poverty and exclusion are daily gaining\r\nground, we, the States Members of the United Nations,\r\nmust undertake a new approach based on a genuine\r\ndialogue inspired by a spirit of genuine partnership between\r\nthe countries of the North and those of the South, which\r\nwill make it possible for us collectively and in a spirit of\r\nsolidarity to confront the challenges of the new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to\r\nMr. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Deputy Foreign Minister for\r\nLegal and International Affairs of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran.\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran): We find this\r\ntwo-day high-level dialogue on the economic and social\r\nimpacts of globalization a very opportune occasion for the\r\ninternational community to take stock of past developments,\r\nengage in an objective assessment of the global situation\r\nand, hopefully, I might add, devise necessary policy\r\nframeworks, if not mechanisms and measures,\r\ncommensurate with the challenges arising from the process\r\nof globalization. In our deliberations here since this\r\nmorning we have heard quite a number of good and\r\ninteresting analyses, which we generally share, on various\r\naspects of the issues under consideration. In particular, we\r\nfully support the statement by the Chairman of the Group\r\nof 77, Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia. In this brief\r\nstatement let me merely draw the attention of this body to\r\na number of observations.\r\nWhat seems to be an undeniable fact of our collective\r\nlife today is the process of globalization, which has for the\r\npast decade or so made itself felt to different degrees and\r\nforms and in different arenas of the national life of\r\nsocieties. While it may be quite some time before we all\r\narrive at a comprehensive understanding of the intricate\r\ninner workings of this rather new process, there is no\r\nshortage of pain and anguish in various parts of the globe\r\nas a result of its disquieting ripple effects. We are all\r\ncognizant of the fact that powerful transnational forces are\r\nat work reshaping the key features of world markets in\r\ncapital, goods, services, labour and technology. Likewise,\r\nwe are aware that the twin processes of globalization and\r\nliberalization have expanded and deepened the\r\ninterdependence of societies, which has, in turn, increased\r\nthe potential for international interaction and cooperation.\r\nThere are, no doubt, beneficiaries of this process,\r\nwhich may even include some interest groups and\r\ncountries from the developing world. But it is the bulk of\r\nthe developing world, particularly the least developed\r\ncountries, that are receiving the shorter end of the\r\nbargain. While the promised potential has yet to\r\nmaterialize, at least for most developing societies the\r\nnegative consequences, mostly of a disruptive nature, are\r\nalready part of their socio-politico-economic landscape.\r\nThe galloping pace of global integration in various fields\r\nand areas has substantially increased the vulnerability of\r\nmany countries and regions and made uncertainty a part\r\nof their everyday life as well as of their future. Today, the\r\nprospect of marginalization and exclusion for many\r\ndeveloping societies is not a possibility on a distant\r\nhorizon, but rather a very bleak tomorrow.\r\nOn the practical outcome of the globalization process\r\n— which, as Minister Alatas has aptly said, is simply\r\nblind and not necessarily evil in nature — let me just\r\nquote words the Secretary-General said back in August\r\n1997:\r\n“Between and within nations, inequality is\r\nincreasing. During the past decade, gaps have\r\nwidened — between the rich and the poor, the\r\nskilled and the unskilled, the powerful and the weak.\r\nAll too often, a cycle of deprivation then sets in.\r\nDisadvantaged segments of the population may feel\r\nangry and hopeless. Sensing that they have no stake\r\nin society, they may turn to crime or other forms of\r\nsocial misbehaviour. Marginalization, social\r\nexclusion and alienation are major challenges of our\r\ntime.” (SG/SM/6300 DEV/2167)\r\nIt is a sobering picture — in fact, a deeply\r\nfrightening outlook. The picture presented earlier today by\r\nthe Deputy Secretary-General is equally disheartening.\r\nNot only has the situation not changed for the better, the\r\nwhole world has been grappling, at least conceptually and\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nanalytically, with the reasons for the emergence of the crisis\r\nin South-East Asia, whose tremors are still being felt in\r\nother parts of the world.\r\nWhat I have just briefly touched on deals with the\r\nreality of the situation, which should inevitably serve as our\r\npoint of departure. Now let me briefly try to touch upon the\r\ncentral purpose of international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment, for whose promotion we have gathered here.\r\nThe need for the promotion of a dialogue to strengthen\r\ninternational economic cooperation has been extensively\r\nreiterated by various international and intergovernmental\r\nbodies and roundly reiterated today. The objective of such\r\ncooperation is to ensure that the benefits of the ongoing\r\nprocess of globalization are spread to the maximum extent\r\npossible among all the actors at the global level, while\r\nsimultaneously minimizing and harnessing its adverse and\r\ndisruptive consequences.\r\nWithin the framework of the existing recognized\r\nnorms of international law and on the basis of our previous\r\nintergovernmental agreements, the immediate objective of\r\nour high-level dialogue here is to promote honest and\r\nconstructive dialogue and meaningful and genuine\r\npartnership at the global level. In fact, over and above\r\nimmediate and short-term remedial measures, whether at the\r\nnational, regional or global level, what we need today, and\r\nneed urgently, is to revive the spirit of Rio and its much-\r\nrevered and yet often neglected global partnership. The very\r\nsolid foundations for such a partnership and international\r\ncooperation are already laid in the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, whose ultimate objective is to help establish\r\na more equitable international economic order and more\r\nequitable international relations. Back in early July we\r\ndiscussed in the high-level segment of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council the important question of market access and\r\nagreed on the imperative of establishing an international\r\ntrading system which is fair, just, rule-based, multilateral\r\nand, certainly, responsive to the needs and conducive to the\r\nlong-term development of the developing countries. Here,\r\nwe are dealing with a broader agenda, but, in essence, with\r\nthe same objective.\r\nBefore concluding, let me just add two very brief\r\npoints. Our emphasis here on the question of international\r\ncooperation and its paramount role in taming the unruly\r\nwinds of globalization does not in any way intend to\r\nneglect or even underestimate the ultimate responsibility\r\nthat each and every society has to shoulder in this regard.\r\nThe second point concerns the need for all actors in the\r\nworld arena to manifest political will, without which the\r\nrealization of global partnership and genuine international\r\ncooperation will prove no more than an illusion. The\r\nexercise of such will by all actors, big and small, should\r\nnot prove beyond reach in the generally propitious\r\npolitical atmosphere of the post-cold-war era.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Turkey.\r\nMr. Vural (Turkey): I welcome this opportunity to\r\naddress some of the most defining issues of our time. The\r\nsocial and economic impact of globalization and\r\ninterdependence are at the forefront of the international\r\nagenda, and rightly so. The important task before us is to\r\nhelp formulate and enhance relevant international policies.\r\nMuch has been said on globalization, and today I\r\nwould like to dwell on some key aspects which we think\r\nshould be a part of our debate. The increasing spread of\r\nthe social effects of economic phenomena, coupled with\r\nthe rapid advances in technology, has made the\r\ncoordination of economic policies at the international\r\nlevel more significant than ever before.\r\nIn this connection, the international dimension of\r\nmacroeconomic stability policies must be considered. We\r\nneed an international environment favourable to the\r\ncontinuation or resumption of growth and investment.\r\nDomestic policies encouraging conditions suitable for\r\ndirect investment should aim at keeping inflation levels\r\nunder control.\r\nIn the area of international financial flows, there is\r\na need to be able to limit volatility while assuring the\r\nefficient functioning of the system. To this end,\r\ncorresponding institutional innovations may be envisaged\r\nfor existing international financial institutions. The overall\r\naim should be to strengthen and improve the architecture\r\nof the international financial system.\r\nThere is also a need for increased harmonization of\r\nrules and regulations pertaining to the efficient\r\nfunctioning of the market mechanism at the international\r\nas well as at the national level. This should include such\r\nmatters as transparency, accountability and the legal\r\nframework.\r\nThe current global financial troubles have shown us\r\nthat national currencies should not be overvalued, unless\r\nas part of a purely short-term strategy aimed at combating\r\ninflation. Experience also points out that a sound analysis\r\nof short term foreign capital inflows is required, and\r\nsufficient reserves should be kept. In any case, a\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\ntransparent and healthy domestic financial system is the\r\nbest prevention for looming crises.\r\nAs countries abandon customs barriers, the concept of\r\nprotectionism has also shifted. Nowadays, technical\r\nprotection methods are increasingly being used. In our era,\r\nthe free market economy is more or less universally\r\naccepted. Multilateral trading negotiations have provided a\r\nplatform to facilitate market access. They have also helped\r\nto define adequate and equitable disciplines in all trade-\r\nrelated areas. Following the successful conclusion of the\r\nUruguay Round and the establishment of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO), one can be more optimistic about the\r\nachievement of an efficient multilateral system in trade-\r\nrelated issues.\r\nBut important obstacles still exist, such as tariff\r\nbarriers and different degrees of market access\r\ncommitments in services. Developing countries must have\r\na more secure and broad-based trade liberalization process.\r\nSpecial attention should be given to the integration of\r\nthe least developed countries into the multilateral trading\r\nsystem. We attach particular importance to the preventing\r\nthe marginalization of the developing countries. We\r\ntherefore fully support the implementation of recently\r\nagreed plans of action. The main targets should be to\r\nachieve better market access conditions for the least\r\ndeveloped countries and to enhance their trading\r\nopportunities.\r\nWe should explore the ways and means of\r\nstrengthening various institutional mechanisms pertaining to\r\ninformation and communication technologies. The\r\ncharacteristics and rapid expansion of electronic commerce\r\nare of particular relevance. We should formulate policies\r\nwhich prevent the exclusion of a significant part of the\r\nworld’s population from benefiting from improved\r\ninformation systems in such areas as education and health.\r\nLastly, we support wholeheartedly the efforts within\r\nthe United Nations system to activate the relevant\r\nmechanisms designed to follow up the implementation of\r\nrecommendations coming out of major conferences. We\r\nbelieve that this is one of the most important functions of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe renewed dialogue at the United Nations is an\r\nindication that all groups of countries, notwithstanding their\r\ndifferences, have decided to reaffirm the centrality of\r\ndevelopment in the international agenda. This is fully in\r\nline with our belief that while individual countries are\r\nultimately responsible for their own development, their\r\nefforts can succeed only within an effective multilateral\r\nframework. Such a framework would spread the benefits\r\nof globalization as widely as possible, while minimizing\r\nits risks and costs.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Maldives.\r\nMr. Shihab (Maldives): As this is the first time I\r\nhave spoken here, I would like to congratulate the\r\nPresident on his election to lead the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-third session. I assure him of my delegation’s\r\nfullest support.\r\nOver the past two decades, the globalization process\r\nhas both expanded and deepened, leading to growth in\r\nworld trade. However, globalization has not had uniform\r\neffects everywhere. Low income countries are\r\ndisadvantaged by the globalization process because of\r\ntheir inability to participate effectively in the transactions\r\nthat take place in the globalized market place. The most\r\nhandicapped are small States, especially the least\r\ndeveloped among them. The reason is simple: to benefit\r\nfrom globalization, not only would these States have to\r\nemerge from their status of extreme underdevelopment,\r\nthey would also have to transcend the unique constraints\r\nimposed by their size.\r\nThe perils of globalization confronting small States\r\ncan be understood by juxtaposing the requirements for\r\nsuccessful integration into the world economy and the\r\neconomic consequences of small size. Success in the\r\nglobal market place requires export growth and\r\ndiversification as well as competitiveness. These require\r\naccess to advanced production technology. For developing\r\ncountries, the acquisition of such technology depends\r\nupon participation in the networks of international\r\ncompanies. In order to promote such technology transfers,\r\ndeveloping countries usually offer transnational\r\ncorporations the prospect of a lucrative domestic market,\r\nwell-developed infrastructure and a large, highly trained\r\nworkforce.\r\nThe least developed countries, especially the smallest\r\namong them, are not able to provide these incentives.\r\nSmall States have a small domestic market and a\r\nnarrowly based economy. There are many structural\r\nconstraints to diversification and expansion, such as very\r\nlimited human and non-human resources. Economies of\r\nscale in production cannot be secured in a small\r\neconomy. Diseconomies of scale in investment and higher\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nper capita costs in establishing basic infrastructure have to\r\nbe borne. In transportation costs, for example, small States\r\non average pay 10 per cent as freight costs, as opposed to\r\nthe global average of 4.5 per cent and 8.3 per cent for all\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nFor small archipelagic States like my own country, the\r\nMaldives, the costs are on average even higher. Moreover,\r\nsmall States are highly vulnerable to external shocks and\r\nare unable to stabilize their domestic economies to resist\r\nthem. All these handicaps add up to a pervasive\r\nvulnerability.\r\nSuch vulnerability has been widely recognized by the\r\ninternational community. However, these constraints are\r\nseen largely to be the result of their status as least-\r\ndeveloped countries than of their smallness per se. What\r\nworries my delegation is not that these handicaps are\r\nsubsumed under least-developed status, but that they are\r\nsometimes overlooked. What follows can be quite startling\r\nin the context of globalization. A good example is the\r\ncurrent criteria used for graduation from least-developed-\r\ncountry status. It is all the more alarming because some of\r\nthe indices used are chosen not because they are the best\r\nindicators of the real situation. Rather, choices are\r\nsometimes guided by the expedient of the availability of\r\ndata. The result might be that critical indicators of structural\r\nimpediments are overlooked, and premature graduation may\r\nbe the result.\r\nIn this context, my delegation notes the conclusions\r\nreached by the Committee for Development Planning at its\r\nthirty-first session, held in 1997, in its analysis of the\r\nimpact of globalization. It pointed out that international\r\nsupport measures are going to be essential for at least\r\nanother 10 years to enable the least-developed countries to\r\nbe integrated into the world economy. Should the small\r\nStates, which face the greatest constraints in export\r\ndiversification, in development of infrastructure and human\r\nresources and in attracting foreign direct investment, be\r\ndenied the international support measures available to least-\r\ndeveloped countries because of their premature graduation?\r\nThis is a question any small island State would pose.\r\nIndeed, premature graduation is like imposing a\r\npenalty for the successes that they have been able to\r\nachieve. The Maldives is one country where positive strides\r\nhave been taken in social and economic development,\r\nduring a long period of political stability. We are pursuing\r\npolicies that will assist us in the long run to be integrated\r\ninto the world economy, by emphasizing human-resources\r\ndevelopment, good governance, economic diversification,\r\ntrade liberalization and other public-sector reforms,\r\nincluding strengthening of the legal structures and pursuit\r\nof other measures to attract foreign investment. We are\r\nalso strong advocates in our region, through the South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation, of the\r\npursuit of greater regionalization in ways consistent with\r\na multilateral trading system. We are doing all we can —\r\nand certainly enough to deserve a supportive response in\r\nour efforts to overcome weakness imposed by size.\r\nWe believe that the policies that we are pursuing\r\nwill enable us to realize the long-term goal of integration\r\ninto the global economy. However, in the meantime, we\r\nneed a supportive external framework. One of its primary\r\npillars is the continuation of the benefits of designation as\r\na least-developed country. Otherwise, all our hard work\r\nmight come to naught, and we could slide a long way\r\nback, imperilled by the forces of globalization. It might\r\nbe worthwhile to consider recommending a moratorium\r\non the graduation of any State until the criteria adopted in\r\n1991 are reviewed in the light of the post-Uruguay-Round\r\ndevelopment of the globalization process and its differing\r\nimpacts on States.\r\nI call upon the Assembly to give due consideration\r\nto this issue as it ponders the links between globalization\r\nand development, and as it deliberates international and\r\nnational policies to meet the challenges ahead.\r\nThe Acting President: I call next on the\r\nrepresentative of Belarus.\r\nMr. Sychou (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThis is by no means the first time this year that the\r\nUnited Nations has considered questions related to the\r\nsocio-economic impact of growing globalization and\r\ninterdependence, and to the policy implications for\r\nGovernments. This is because in addition to their positive\r\naspects, the processes now under way have negative\r\nconsequences as well, which require constant attention\r\nand coordinated action by the international community.\r\nGlobalization of the world economy and interdependence\r\nof States have now reached a level where a sharp\r\nfluctuation in the economic situation in a single fairly\r\nlarge country, whether caused by political change or by\r\npurely economic factors, inevitably sets in motion a series\r\nof processes in States that are trading partners of that\r\ncountry.\r\nBefore we had been able to overcome fully the\r\neffects of the late-August financial crisis in South-East\r\nAsia, a similar crisis hit the financial markets in the\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nRussian Federation. This has had a destabilizing impact on\r\nthe socio-economic situation in a number of States,\r\nincluding countries of the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates (CIS), many of whose imports and exports are\r\ngeared towards Russia. The crisis has caused price increases\r\nand a drop in national currencies vis-à-vis hard currencies.\r\nAs a result, there has been a decline in the standard of\r\nliving, causing enormous social problems.\r\nAs the situation is stabilized, it is important that these\r\nevents be evaluated with a view to determining how to\r\nquickly eliminate the effects of such crises and how to\r\nprevent similar situations from arising in other regions.\r\nIn our view, the events of August and September of\r\nthis year, along with the crises in South-East Asia, to some\r\nextent reveal a lack of decisive action on the part of the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, with regard both to preventing\r\ncrises and to minimizing and eliminating their effects. This\r\nshows that the financial institutions must create a\r\nmechanism for interaction with national Governments when\r\ncrises arise.\r\nWe cannot absolve national Governments of blame for\r\nthese crises, since sustainable socio-economic policies are\r\na guarantee of the stable functioning of international\r\ncommodity and stock markets. Governments must take\r\nadequate preventive action for macroeconomic regulation.\r\nMoreover, in our view, we must increase and actively draw\r\non the potential of regional and subregional cooperation in\r\nthe context of integrated associations of States; through this\r\nwe can jointly prevent and eliminate the consequences of\r\nacute crises. The timely formulation of a mechanism for\r\ncoordination among countries in these situations could play\r\nan important role in carrying out such tasks.\r\nHowever, when making bigger demands on national\r\nGovernments, we should take into account that many\r\ndeveloping countries and some with economies in transition\r\nare not yet ready to function in the open global economy.\r\nMoreover, the increasing trends towards globalization and\r\ninterdependence have exacerbated the vulnerability of these\r\ncountries to the transnational processes, which are\r\nsometimes negative for them. That is why there is an acute\r\nneed for international support for these groups of countries\r\nin order to ensure the balanced development of all States in\r\nthe current circumstances. Primarily, this implies\r\ndeveloping and implementing sustainable social and\r\neconomic policies, including regulating the balance between\r\nthe public and private sectors, stimulating and protecting\r\ninvestments, regulating financial markets, and encouraging\r\nthe involvement of all social groups in the economic life\r\nof the country.\r\nHowever, it would appear that these measures are\r\nnot sufficient to ensure the sustainable development of all\r\nStates. Additional steps must be taken fully to integrate\r\nthe developing countries and those with economies in\r\ntransition into the world economic processes. It is\r\nimportant to create favourable external conditions for\r\nStates to develop in the current context. That is why the\r\nwork of the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations in accumulating international development\r\nassistance and fully and fairly integrating the developing\r\ncountries and those with economies in transition into the\r\nmultilateral system of international trade is currently a\r\nkey factor of development. Our special hopes are placed\r\non the World Trade Organization, the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development, the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\r\nIndustrial Development Organization and the United\r\nNations regional Commissions.\r\nWe are still unable today to enjoy the blessings of\r\nglobalization and liberalization reasonably and effectively.\r\nOne of the major tasks facing the international community\r\ntoday is to make these advantages accessible to all.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nPermanent Representative of Brazil.\r\nMr. Amorim (Brazil): It is a common perception\r\ntoday — and even commonplace to say — that\r\nglobalization is an inescapable process which brings both\r\nopportunities and risks. But this truism is maybe the only\r\nassertion we can easily agree on as the dramatic events of\r\nthe past two years cast a shadow on the way the risks of\r\nglobalization have been managed so far.\r\nThese events reinforce the perception that\r\nglobalization is not a painless process; that, in and by\r\nitself, it does not overcome the logic of exclusion and\r\nmarginalization, both between and within countries; and\r\nthat, despite the recognition of the clear benefits of the\r\nintegration of global markets, there is an urgent need to\r\naddress the systemic weaknesses that tend to exacerbate\r\nthe inherent asymmetries on which the process of\r\nglobalization rests.\r\nAs the President of my country, Fernando Henrique\r\nCardoso, recently stated, the great challenge before us\r\ntoday, both in practical and conceptual terms, is\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\n“to move away from a globalization of exclusion and\r\nlay down the foundations of a globalization of\r\nsolidarity”.\r\nOr, as the famous economist Jeffrey Sachs put it in an\r\narticle in the 12 September issue of the magazine The\r\nEconomist, without “a sense of shared stewardship between\r\nrich and poor”, and without a change in current institutions,\r\n“global capitalism will not succeed widely enough or\r\ncredibly enough to create a stable world system.”\r\nThese calls were echoed somehow in the important\r\nspeech made by President Clinton last Monday before the\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations here in New York. However,\r\nthe case for a renewed impetus to growth in the world\r\neconomy and for increased assistance from the multilateral\r\nfinancial institutions must be based not only on the premise\r\nthat the countries most hit by the current financial crisis are\r\ncustomers, competitors, friends, allies and security partners,\r\nbut also on the notions of equity and solidarity.\r\nAs the drastic movements of short-term capital\r\nexposed the vulnerability of emerging economies to\r\npredatory behaviour in financial markets and caused\r\neconomic disruption and social unrest in many parts of the\r\nworld, a recognition of the need for fundamental changes\r\nin the way the international institutions respond to the risks\r\nof globalization gradually emerged.\r\nThe implicit message in all proposals and ideas\r\nadvanced so far is that the traditional recipes pursued by\r\nthose institutions need to be revisited; that domestic fiscal\r\nand monetary policies need some flexibility to adjust to\r\ncrisis; that there must be an equitable sharing of the costs\r\nof the financial crisis; that the bail-out of creditors cannot\r\nbe pursued at the expense of the most vulnerable segments\r\nof the world population; that the multilateral institutions\r\nmust vigorously help in devising social safety nets; and, last\r\nbut not least, that the international response to systemic\r\nweaknesses in the prevention and management of financial\r\ncrises needs to be based on a broad consensus which fully\r\ninvolves the participation of developing countries.\r\nIf there is a silver lining in the tumultuous situation\r\nwe are now facing, it is that a growing number of scholars\r\nand political leaders are coming around to accept these\r\nrealities. In the same vein, it is encouraging to note the\r\nongoing discussions within the Group of 22. The same\r\nspirit of joint responsibility inspired the recent meeting\r\nbetween the International Monetary Fund and the Finance\r\nMinisters of Latin America, as well as the call for a\r\nmeeting between Finance Ministers and Central Bank\r\nauthorities which President Clinton made just three days\r\nago. We strongly encourage these efforts to proceed.\r\nIn recent years, macroeconomic stabilization was\r\nvigorously pursued in my country through a mix of fiscal\r\nand monetary policies that brought inflation to a 50-year\r\nlow, from a peak of nearly 2,500 per cent in 1993 to less\r\nthan 5 per cent in 1998. Substantial budget cuts were\r\naccompanied by structural reforms and a broad\r\nprivatization programme opened up to private domestic\r\nand foreign investment sectors such as mining and steel,\r\npower generation, telecommunications and transportation.\r\nIn the external sector, a comprehensive liberalization\r\nprogramme eliminated non-tariff barriers and brought the\r\naverage tariff down to 12 per cent. This was achieved not\r\nonly on a national basis, but in accordance with our\r\nregional commitments within MERCOSUL. The overall\r\nincrease in real gross domestic product per capita and the\r\neffects of macroeconomic stabilization on income\r\ndistribution and the standard of living of the poorer are\r\nreflected in the fact that, for the first time, in 1998 the\r\nHuman Development Report ranks Brazil among the\r\ncountries with a high human development index.\r\nThus, macroeconomic stability is certainly conducive\r\nto both domestic and foreign investment. But, as the\r\nvolatile situation that affects us all shows, there are clear\r\nlimits to what countries can individually or regionally\r\nachieve. The role played by the international environment\r\nis crucial. The coordination of macroeconomic policy by\r\nthe major economies, especially with regard to interest\r\nrates, is essential to prevent systemic financial crises. The\r\nsame consideration applies to measures aimed at boosting\r\ndomestic demand and imports. There is an urgent need to\r\narticulate coherent measures in the areas of trade\r\nliberalization, banking oversight, interest-rate\r\nmanagement, external debt relief and emergency lending\r\nto avoid or to mitigate the negative impact of the extreme\r\nvolatility of financial flows. I think, more than ever\r\nbefore, the link between trade and finance has become\r\nclear and it is very obvious that, if liberalization is to be\r\na sustainable process in developing countries, we will\r\nneed the opening of markets and the elimination of tariff\r\nand non-tariff barriers in developed countries that affect\r\nthe exports of the developing ones.\r\nThe reform of the international financial system\r\nrequires a clear-cut commitment to greater and more\r\neffective international financial cooperation. Just as in the\r\n1980s and early 1990s we established the landmark of a\r\nnew multilateral trading system, in the late 1990s we\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\ncannot fail to concentrate on a more democratic architecture\r\nfor the international financial system — a new architecture\r\nwhich is better equipped to respond to the challenges and\r\nthe risks inherent in globalization.\r\nLet me reassert the full commitment of my country to\r\nthis process. We will continue to work with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the Bank for International\r\nSettlements in devising and promoting the dissemination of\r\nappropriate instruments for banking oversight and\r\nregulation. We will continue to take a cautious and gradual\r\napproach to capital accounts liberalization. We are also\r\ncommitted to the strengthening of multilateral oversight, but\r\nthis should rely chiefly on the frankness and quality of the\r\npolicy dialogue between the Fund and its member countries.\r\nAs the Brazilian Minister of Finance recently stated in the\r\nInterim Committee,\r\n“No one — not even the Fund — has a monopoly on\r\ntruth or the capacity to define precisely, beyond any\r\ndoubt, the right thing to do, the moment of doing it,\r\nand the unique manner of balancing the inevitable\r\ntrade-offs in economic policy-making”.\r\nLastly, I wish to stress that we firmly believe in the\r\npolicy dialogue between the United Nations and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions. This dialogue has already proved its\r\nusefulness and is essential to reaching a better\r\nunderstanding of the new realities of this globalized world.\r\nIf I may be allowed a brief reflection on the future,\r\nmaybe we could devise a more interactive format for this\r\ndialogue which may enable us to extract meaningful\r\nconclusions from the debate. Otherwise, we will just be\r\nrepeating — although perhaps in a more solemn fashion —\r\nwhat we already do in the Second Committee of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The renewed dialogue must be a true\r\ndialogue and not a series of monologues.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Morocco.\r\nMr. Snoussi (Morocco) (interpretation from French):\r\nI would first of all like to extend my sincere\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your unanimous and well-\r\ndeserved election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-third session. I would also like to take\r\nthis opportunity to wish you every success in your mission,\r\nespecially since our Assembly will be called upon to\r\ncontinue its examination on the reform programme\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General.\r\nI would also like to express my delegations full\r\nsupport for the statement made this morning by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China. We were very pleased to hear\r\nhim express the main concerns and expectations of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe delegation of Morocco is pleased at the holding\r\nof this first high-level dialogue on strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation for development\r\nthrough partnership, a dialogue for which developing\r\ncountries have been continuously calling, through the\r\nGroup of 77, for almost the last five years.\r\nThe end of the cold war and the growing\r\nliberalization of financial and information flows which\r\nfollowed gave rise to unprecedented enthusiasm\r\nthroughout the world for the adoption of economic\r\nsystems based on the primacy of private capital in the\r\norganization of production and consumption activities.\r\nWith the disappearance of the ideological confrontation\r\nand the attendant standardization of the values governing\r\ndifferent areas of society, national borders — which in\r\nthe past were more or less tightly sealed in many parts of\r\nthe world — have become less opaque and more\r\npermeable to external flows of capital and merchandise.\r\nCountries — in particular developing countries and\r\ncountries in transition — have now entered a frantic\r\ncompetition to attract private capital and foreign\r\ninvestment. These have become all the more essential to\r\neconomic growth since financial concessions in the form\r\nof official development assistance have continued to\r\ndecline.\r\nUnfortunately, not all countries have been equally\r\nequipped to join the emerging world economy smoothly.\r\nIn fact, many States have not been able to withstand the\r\nwinds of change and freedom because their structures\r\nwere too rigid and were based on outdated principles.\r\nSome have even collapsed and crumbled, leaving in their\r\nwake societies in turmoil in which antagonistic forces\r\nwage deadly battles that often take civilians as their\r\ninnocent victims.\r\nWorld trade became freer as a result of the signing\r\nin 1994 of the Marrakesh Agreement creating the World\r\nTrade Organization. This made access to the markets of\r\ndeveloped countries more competitive and forced export\r\ncompanies to adopt more profitable production methods.\r\nOf course, reducing costs in order to remain competitive\r\nled to increased unemployment and social problems in\r\nmost countries, especially developing countries. At the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nsame time, international financial institutions invoked the\r\nspectre of marginalization for all countries that were\r\ntempted not to make the sizeable adjustments necessary to\r\njoin the global economy.\r\nFurthermore, the future appears unforeseeable and\r\nuncertain for countries trying to remain within the circle of\r\nnations that have not succumbed to the constraints of\r\ntransition, in spite of their efforts to maintain a\r\nmacroeconomic balance, strengthen the competitiveness of\r\ntheir businesses and ensure the servicing of their foreign\r\ndebt.\r\nIn reality, private financial flows can deal a severe\r\nblow to the countries that attract them if confidence in the\r\nviability of the target economies is lost.\r\nInternational trade is less free for goods such as\r\nagricultural products metals, textiles and clothing, which are\r\nof great export interest to developing countries, and labour\r\nmarkets have become almost completely closed. At the\r\nsame time, flows of official development assistance, which\r\nare an important source of financing for many African\r\ncountries, have fallen to a very low level, currently\r\nrepresenting 0.22 per cent of the gross national product of\r\nthe member countries of the Development Assistance\r\nCommittee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development.\r\nThe risk of marginalization, financial crises, the\r\nburden of foreign indebtedness and widespread\r\nunemployment will ultimately cloud prospects for the future\r\nand undermine the will for adjustment of the most serious\r\ncountries if their efforts are not supported by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe hope that the dialogue we have just begun under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations will be constructive and\r\nthat it will lead to genuine partnership based on shared\r\nresponsibility and mutual advantage, as emphasized in\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 52/186. The future of\r\neconomic multilateralism at the United Nations will be\r\nlinked to our ability to find concrete and concerted actions\r\nto remedy the problems of the less developed countries of\r\nthe international community. The credibility of the United\r\nNations in the eyes of the populations of our world will\r\ndepend on its capacity to go beyond rhetoric and to ensure\r\nthat the deliberations of its bodies are followed by actions\r\nwhose effects can be felt at the national and local levels.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to draw the\r\nattention of the international community to the tragic\r\nsituation on the African continent, which is overwhelmed\r\nby conflicts, poverty and social problems. We would like\r\nto take this opportunity to reiterate the appeal that was\r\nmade at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\r\nconference in Marrakesh by His Majesty King Hassan II\r\nfor the adoption and implementation of an international\r\nMarshall Plan that could help Africa emerge from its\r\nendemic crisis and could place our continent, which has\r\nbeen the most affected, on the path to development and\r\nprosperity.\r\nMr. Ngo Quang Xuan (Viet Nam): It is indeed a\r\npleasure to see Mr. Didier Opertti presiding over this first\r\nimportant dialogue on globalization, which is having a\r\nforceful impact on humankind and on the development of\r\ntoday\u0027s world.\r\nGlobalization has become a general trend of our\r\ntime. It speeds up the expansion of the financial,\r\ncommodities and services markets, intensifies the\r\nsocialized character of the world economy and strengthens\r\nthe interdependence between nations and regions. At the\r\nsame time, competition becomes fiercer than ever before.\r\nEach and every nation, in order not to be marginalized\r\nfrom the process of development, must actively\r\nparticipate in the process in accordance with its\r\ndevelopment capacity and objectives. Each nation must\r\nformulate an appropriate policy on international\r\nintegration so as to benefit from the positive aspects of\r\nthe process while minimizing the negative ones.\r\nGlobalization creates more favourable conditions for\r\nimport, export and investment, helping to promote\r\neconomic growth. A strategy for economic growth\r\ncomprising two elements — export and investment — is\r\nbeing developed by the majority of countries. The\r\noutcome of General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO)\r\nnegotiations, coupled with the establishment of free-trade\r\nareas, has considerably improved market access and trade\r\nliberalization throughout the world. Nevertheless, reality\r\nhas shown that it is still hard for commodities from\r\ndeveloping countries to access the markets of developed\r\ncountries, due to their weak competitiveness. Meanwhile,\r\nthe Generalised System of Preferences is being narrowed,\r\nand disguised trade barriers in the form of quality criteria,\r\nenvironmental requirements and labour and social\r\nstandards continue to be misused.\r\nNations — especially developing countries — taking\r\npart in the WTO, a global economic mechanism, should\r\nmake the best use possible of the Dispute Settlement\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nUnderstanding arrangement. This arrangement is in the\r\nfundamental interest of developing countries within the\r\nWTO because it can help them avoid trade limits\r\nunilaterally imposed by various developed countries. Since\r\nthe balance of trade is affected by free-trade measures,\r\ndeveloping countries could lay a good foundation for a\r\nbalanced account through increasingly export-oriented\r\nproduction.\r\nTrade liberalization and investment create conditions\r\nfor increased capital flows and technology transfer.\r\nHowever, how to use these capital flows and technology\r\neffectively is a difficult issue. The recent financial and\r\nmonetary crisis stands out as an example of the improper\r\nuse of capital. Developing countries should learn from it so\r\nas to steer their investment plans in the right direction, in\r\nkeeping with their demands and development targets.\r\nLiberalization will lead us to a situation in which some\r\nproduction areas contract while others expand. To define\r\nthe impact of liberalization on employment means\r\ndetermining the balance between lost jobs due to contracted\r\nproduction areas and new jobs created in the production of\r\ngoods for export. Nevertheless, in the long run the negative\r\nimpact of trade liberalization on labour utilization could be\r\nresolved through the redistribution of human resources\r\namong economic areas.\r\nChanges in the production structure lead to changes in\r\nthe income ratio of different population groups. Differences\r\nin income are the basis of social inequality. A fair social\r\npolicy that takes into account the interests of various social\r\nstrata with different income levels is therefore essential to\r\nensure equality and mitigate the possible negative aspects\r\nof liberalization.\r\nTo fully grasp the opportunities brought about by the\r\nliberalization of trade and investment, countries must seek\r\nto exploit their comparative advantages. However, these\r\nadvantages should be exploited in a balanced and\r\nreasonable manner in the context of a long-term strategy\r\nthat steers clear of the danger of exhausting resources and\r\npolluting the environment. A strategy for sustainable\r\ndevelopment is therefore necessary for every country.\r\nOver the past decade, Viet Nam has carried out a\r\npolicy of economic reform, building a market economy\r\nwith state regulation, and has become more thoroughly\r\nintegrated into the regional and world economy.\r\nViet Nam is aware not only of the great benefits\r\nbrought about by the process of economic globalization, but\r\nalso of its challenges. We plan to continue with the policy\r\nof renovation, to strengthen our own internal capacity and\r\nto become more thoroughly integrated into the regional\r\nand world economy.\r\nIn the process of renovation and international\r\nintegration, which is replete with difficulties and\r\nchallenges, Viet Nam wishes to strengthen its relations of\r\ncooperation in the economic, trade, investment, and\r\nscience and technology fields and to broaden its market\r\nwith all countries, international organizations and partners.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to The\r\nHonourable Manuel Villar, Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Villar (Philippines): It is indeed gratifying to\r\nnote that the vision of the fiftieth session of the General\r\nAssembly when it first considered the resolution on the\r\nrenewal of the dialogue has now come to fruition. Let us\r\nthen exert our best efforts to ensure that the Assembly\r\nmay find the required courses of action to assist countries\r\nin obviating the negative consequences of globalization.\r\nGlobalization, of course, has a brighter side. The\r\nlatter part of the twentieth century has witnessed a\r\nphenomenal expansion of international trade flows. World\r\nexports increased from $315 billion in 1970 to $3,447\r\nbillion in 1990. Foreign direct investment in the world\r\neconomy increased from $502 billion in 1980 to $1,948\r\nbillion in 1992.\r\nThe past two decades have also witnessed an\r\nenormous growth in international finance. In foreign\r\nexchange markets, for instance, trading was a modest $15\r\nbillion per day in 1973. This soared to $900 billion per\r\nday in 1992.\r\nIt is therefore not difficult to see the positive side of\r\nglobalization. Such tremendous increases in global trade,\r\ninvestment and finance could only mean a rise in\r\nprosperity.\r\nYet we wonder — prosperity for whom? Obviously,\r\nthe rapidly growing East Asian countries and a few other\r\ndeveloping countries benefited from the process of\r\nglobalization, as together they accounted for about 68 per\r\ncent of the recent increase in trade of the developing\r\ncountries, and they have been the main recipients of the\r\nforeign direct investment to the developing world. Thus,\r\ntheir per capita income rose, their incidence of poverty\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\ndeclined, and the overall material well-being of their\r\npeoples improved.\r\nBut what has globalization done to the rest of the\r\ndeveloping countries? It appears that its beneficial effects\r\nhave been marginal. The Human Development Report has\r\ndisturbing findings: a fifth of the world\u0027s population, or 1.3\r\nbillion people, continue to be mired in absolute poverty;\r\nover 50 per cent of the world\u0027s population has less than five\r\nper cent of global income; and the distance between the\r\nrich and poor worldwide is intolerably great.\r\nEven the rapidly growing economies in the developing\r\nworld are now having doubts as to where the process of\r\nglobalization will take them. The financial crisis in East\r\nAsia has wiped out the economic and social gains achieved\r\npainstakingly over the years. The crisis has affected\r\neveryone in those countries through sharp exchange-rate\r\ndepreciation, financial-sector collapse, corporate bankruptcy,\r\nchanges in rates of return on assets and monetary\r\ntightening. The International Labour Organization reported\r\nthat since October of last year unemployment has spiralled\r\nin those countries.\r\nThe crisis has spread to other parts of the world and\r\nmay lead the global economy into a deep recession. The\r\nUnited Nations World Economic and Social Survey, 1998\r\nalready reported that, as a consequence of the crisis, the\r\ngrowth of output for 1998 is slowing down in both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, while the growth of\r\nworld trade is also decelerating.\r\nIf the trend ends up causing social disintegration in\r\ncountries and the collapse of the global economy, then we\r\nhave only ourselves to blame for not having the foresight\r\nand fortitude to change the direction of history.\r\nOf course, we cannot simply wish away the process of\r\nglobalization. It is a reality of a modern world. The process\r\nis irreversible. The individual countries and the international\r\ncommunity can only take action to ensure that its benefits\r\nare maximized and its downside minimized. Late as it may\r\nbe already, it is nonetheless incumbent upon us now to\r\nundertake, separately and collectively, a very thorough\r\nreview of the effects of globalization — its economic and\r\nsocial impact — and devise an action plan principally\r\ndesigned to avert its destructive forces.\r\nWhat must be done? It should be very clear by now\r\nthat the benefits of integration with the world economy\r\nthrough globalization can accrue only to those countries that\r\nhave strengthened their foundations for industrialization and\r\ndevelopment. Countries must invest in the development of\r\nhuman resources and create the required physical\r\ninfrastructure. Countries must raise the productivity of\r\ntheir agricultural sector. Countries must use strategic\r\nindustrial policy to develop technological and managerial\r\ncapabilities. And they must establish institutions designed\r\nto adequately regulate their financial markets. In this\r\nregard, I wish to refer to what the United Nations World\r\nEconomic and Social Survey, 1998 has noted: what may\r\nbe most needed at this time is not more decontrol and\r\nderegulation, but more effective official oversight and\r\nmarket-based controls of financial markets.\r\nUnless appropriate responses are made by both the\r\nindividual countries themselves and the international\r\ncommunity, the asymmetries implicit in the process of\r\nglobalization are bound to intensify uneven development.\r\nConsequently, many countries will experience an\r\nexclusion from the process of globalization that could\r\nincrease the economic distance between nations, widen\r\nincome disparities between peoples and heighten social\r\ndivisions.\r\nI wish to echo what Mr. Rubens Ricupero,\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development, said at the substantive session of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council last year: further\r\nliberalization of trade and investment has to take into\r\naccount the legitimate aspirations of Governments to\r\nprotect their financial stability and their right to determine\r\nthe course of their own development strategy as well as\r\nthe health of their population, cultural identity and\r\nphysical environment. It is also worth noting that last\r\nyear, in resolution 52/180, this Assembly invited the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) to ensure that, in\r\nexercising its role in promoting capital account\r\nliberalization, it does so in an orderly and flexible manner\r\nso as to enable member countries to tailor capital account\r\nliberalization to the circumstances of each individual\r\ncountry.\r\nI do not wish to deny that some actions have been\r\nundertaken at the international level. In fact, I should to\r\nlike to note the positive influence of the United Nations\r\non the required interventions to assist developing\r\ncountries. World Bank President James Wolfensohn\r\nindicated in the Economic and Social Council that the\r\nemphasis in the Bank\u0027s lending programmes has switched\r\nin last decade from physical infrastructure to support for\r\njobs, schools, medical care and food, in large part due to\r\nthe United Nations. And IMF Managing Director Michel\r\nCamdessus said that the international community must\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\npull together to support the adjustment programmes of\r\nthose countries most severely affected by the crisis and\r\nurge countries with balance-of-payments surpluses to\r\nrecycle those surpluses in the form of untied loans and\r\nhumanitarian aid to adjusting countries, to grant generous\r\nterms for restructured loans and to keep their markets open.\r\nWe therefore have to reinforce the positive action\r\nalready in place. Let us call on all countries, particularly\r\nthe developed countries, to manifest their political will in\r\nconfronting the challenges of globalization through action\r\nthat will help all countries defend themselves. We already\r\nhave a vision of what can be done. It may be recalled that\r\nat the G-7 Summit in France in 1996, French President\r\nJacques Chirac called for controlled globalization, and\r\ntogether with German Chancellor Kohl pressed for tighter\r\ncontrols on money markets, among other things. And the\r\nstatement President Clinton made in New York last Monday\r\n— in which he said that the United States would convene,\r\nwithin 30 days, a meeting of finance ministers from major\r\ncountries to recommend ways to adapt the international\r\nfinancial architecture to the twenty-first century — certainly\r\ngave signs of urgent and collective action to stem the crisis.\r\nWe must tame the forces of globalization to serve only\r\ndevelopment and prosperity. This we must do to sustain the\r\ndevelopment path of countries and lift up countless people\r\nwho are in misery. We owe it to ourselves and to the\r\ngenerations to come to do the best we can.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Tchoulkov (Russian Federation) (interpretation\r\nfrom Russian): Because of unforeseen circumstances,\r\nAmbassador Lavrov is not able to speak at this very\r\nimportant meeting of the General Assembly. Upon his\r\ninstructions, I shall make this statement on his behalf.\r\nWe attach great importance to the fact that the General\r\nAssembly has turned its attention to the pressing problem\r\nof the socio-economic consequences of globalization.\r\nAlthough some of its aspects have already been discussed\r\nthis year at the United Nations, we believe that this debate\r\nis very timely, since it is taking place as the financial crisis\r\nin South-East Asia is growing beyond its regional\r\ndimension to become transcontinental, while the world\r\nfinancial and commodity markets are losing their stability.\r\nThese disturbing symptoms call for the closest attention\r\nfrom the international community and for the adoption of\r\nadequate measures, which our forum today is to define.\r\nIn recent years, the globalization processes in the\r\nworld economy and the growing interdependence of\r\nnational commodity, service and capital markets have\r\nbeen perceived as a positive phenomenon, contributing to\r\neconomic growth and the more effective use of global\r\nresources. Nevertheless, globalization-related risks posing\r\na potential threat to unfledged economies — especially\r\nthose that have not yet become sufficiently competitive —\r\nwere underemphasized and underestimated. The situation\r\nin South-East Asia and its impact on other regions have\r\nclearly demonstrated that globalization sharply increases\r\nthe requirements of quality and effectiveness in terms of\r\nboth domestic policy and concerted international efforts\r\nto assist the affected countries, as well as to prevent the\r\nregional crisis from becoming a global one.\r\nWe commend and support the efforts undertaken by\r\nthe world community and international financial\r\ninstitutions to stabilize the economies and financial\r\nsystems of the countries affected by the crisis. However,\r\nthe developments that have taken place in recent months\r\nin various Eastern European countries, including Russia,\r\nand the continuing socio-economic turmoil in Asia send\r\na dramatic warning that more decisive action by the\r\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions is\r\nneeded, perhaps including the joint development of an\r\nanti-crisis programme. It is urgent that the existing\r\ninternational financial institutions should be gradually\r\nturned into a more effective instrument for the\r\nconsolidation of the global financial system, the regulation\r\nof transboundary financial flows and the implementation\r\nof preventive anti-crisis measures, including — following\r\nthe example of the World Trade Organization — through\r\nthe development of international rules and standards of\r\nconduct for financial market operators, as well as the\r\nmonitoring of compliance.\r\nWe are convinced that, as an integral part of a\r\npackage of measures designed to improve financial\r\nstability, Governments should play an active role in the\r\nmanagement of a well-balanced process of liberalization\r\nand regulation of national financial markets in order to\r\npromote domestic and foreign investment in productive\r\nindustries.\r\nWe acknowledge and commend the contribution\r\nmade by the United Nations and its economic bodies to\r\nthe reaching of international consensus on pressing issues\r\nof global economic development, as well as to promoting\r\nthe integration into world markets of developing and least\r\ndeveloped countries and of economies in transition, those\r\nnot yet sufficiently resistant to the negative impact of\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nmarket forces. At the same time, the United Nations should\r\nplay a more vigorous role in establishing an international\r\nearly-warning system for crisis situations in economic\r\ndevelopment and work more closely with international\r\nfinancial institutions on related issues. Priority areas of\r\ncooperation might include monitoring financial flows and\r\ngovernment economic policies, rendering assistance to\r\nneedy countries in gathering objective information on\r\neconomic and financial-market situations and enhancing the\r\ninternational forecasting capability.\r\nWith globalization and the increased risk of its\r\nnegative effects, the problem of development financing calls\r\nfor greater attention from the international community. We\r\nwelcome the efforts undertaken by the United Nations and\r\nthe World Bank to develop partnership with the private\r\nsector in order to assist Member States in the achievement\r\nof sustainable economic and social development.\r\nThe crisis prompts us to take a fresh look at the\r\ndividends derived from interdependence in the modern\r\nworld. A lack of control over any processes taking place in\r\nthe global economy, and their unpredictability, could have\r\nthe gravest consequences. Recently, many columnists have\r\ncompared today’s world with a schooner caught in a\r\nturbulent current, whose oarsmen can withstand the force of\r\nnature only if they make a concerted effort. I would extend\r\nthis metaphor by saying that in order to make it to a safe\r\nharbour, the efforts of the oarsmen alone will not suffice;\r\nit is imperative that the captains of the financial and\r\neconomic fleet join in the paddling. The sooner we realize\r\nthat, the sooner we will become partners professing one\r\nsimple principle: the prosperity of all can be secured\r\nthrough the well-being of each individual.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I would like to fully associate\r\nmy delegation with the statement made this morning by\r\nMinister Ali Alatas of Indonesia on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China. My delegation welcomes the convening of\r\nthis high-level meeting.\r\nThe discussion in this forum on the economic and\r\nsocial impact of globalization is very timely in view of the\r\ncurrent global situation. We have seen financial and\r\neconomic turmoil affecting many countries in the last year.\r\nWhat was initially dismissed by some as merely a regional\r\neconomic problem has now been transformed into a global\r\nphenomenon. The contagion effect of the Asian financial\r\ncrisis is very real indeed. The financial crisis has resulted\r\nin a lot of uncertainties even in the major economies. We\r\nhave seen the South-East Asian economies regress in just\r\none year. The economic gains made in the last decade are\r\nnow experiencing severe setbacks. These economies are\r\nnow in recession. The economic and social progress\r\nresulting from years of hard work has been severely\r\nretarded in the process.\r\nThe current crisis demonstrates very clearly some of\r\nthe negative impacts of globalization. Advocates of\r\nglobalization and liberalization would argue that invisible\r\nhands in a free and liberalized international market should\r\nbe given free rein to promote optimal resource allocation\r\nand growth globally. To them, Governments should\r\nmerely play the role of facilitator to promote a conducive\r\nenvironment for market forces to operate in.\r\nGovernments, they say, should not intervene and upset the\r\nequilibrium. But they must also realize that a Government\r\nhas the obligation to protect its people and defend their\r\ninterests. In the last year, many Governments have had to\r\nact to defend their countries from currency and stock\r\nmarket speculators operating under the pretext of\r\nglobalization and liberalization.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of the economic turmoil in\r\nAsia, Russia and around the world, there is now broad\r\nagreement that the problem we face today has been\r\nlargely a result of a large infusion of capital into the\r\nemerging markets without due regard for the risks, and a\r\ntoo-abrupt withdrawal without due regard for long-term\r\nprospects. In recent weeks, we have seen efforts\r\nundertaken by the authorities in Hong Kong, Taiwan and\r\nRussia, employing various means to try to cope with their\r\nrespective problems.\r\nIt is very clear that the boom-and-bust behaviour of\r\nshort-term lenders and investors had been largely\r\nresponsible for triggering the crisis. In 1996, some $100\r\nbillion of capital flowed into Asia. More or less the same\r\namount had flowed out by the second half of 1997. Such\r\na dramatic reversal has caused violent depreciation of\r\ncurrencies, highly volatile exchange rates and rapid\r\nincreases in interest rates. Asset markets have plunged to\r\nrecord lows. Banks ceased lending, given the tight\r\nliquidity, high interest rates and increasing numbers of\r\nnon-performing loans. This in turn has led to a severe\r\ncontraction of the real economy in the affected countries.\r\nSince Malaysia is one of those countries that has\r\nbeen seriously affected by this phenomenon, I shall spend\r\nsome time on the Malaysian situation. Within a matter of\r\nmonths, following the assault on our currency, our per\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\ncapita income shrank substantially. Our economic growth,\r\nwhich had averaged about 8 per cent over the last several\r\nyears, suddenly became negative. This year our economy\r\nshrank by a further 6.8 per cent in the second quarter after\r\na contraction of 2.8 per cent in the first quarter. We are in\r\nour first recession in 13 years, our second in more than 40\r\nyears.\r\nThe Government of Malaysia has little choice but to\r\nact — and to act urgently and decisively. We have arrived\r\nat a difficult conclusion. Our priority is to protect the\r\neconomy and to regain our economic independence. Drastic\r\ntimes require drastic measures. If drastic measures were not\r\ntaken immediately to get growth going again, the Malaysian\r\neconomy would continue to drop like a stone. We have to\r\nresuscitate our economy ourselves. The sooner we can get\r\nback on track, the better it is for us, our neighbours and the\r\nregion. There are, of course, risks involved. Indeed, nothing\r\nis without risk. But Malaysia is prepared to take a\r\ncalculated risk. Any palliative has its own side-effects.\r\nThe Government of Malaysia has implemented a\r\npackage of measures to enforce strict exchange controls to\r\ninsulate the economy from the risks and vulnerability\r\nbrought about by external developments. Critics say that we\r\nhave taken a step back from the free market with the\r\nintroduction of currency control. Our aim is to stop off-\r\nshore trading of the ringgit, our national currency, and to\r\nmaintain a fixed exchange rate. With these new measures\r\nand the pegging of the ringgit at a fixed rate, there is now\r\ngreater predictability for the currency, which facilitates our\r\nexternal trade.\r\nMalaysia’s so-called step backward is being taken to\r\ninsulate rather than to isolate the country. We are merely\r\ninsulating our economy from future speculation in and\r\nmanipulation of our currency by currency traders. In this\r\nregard we welcome the view of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as\r\ncontained in the Trade and Development Report 1998, that\r\na country facing an attack on its currency should have the\r\nright to impose an automatic, unilateral action. Sometimes\r\nwe may have to take a step backward in order to leap\r\nforward. For all practical purposes, for the moment\r\nMalaysia can stop worrying about speculative attacks on the\r\nringgit and the massive currency turbulence brewing in\r\nmany parts of the world. The current stable conditions\r\nshould be welcomed by those who genuinely wish to trade\r\nwith and invest in Malaysia confident in the knowledge that\r\nthe measures taken are temporary in nature and are targeted\r\nsolely at the currency speculators and manipulators.\r\nBefore we took these drastic measures, Malaysia had\r\nin fact persevered since the crisis began one year ago in\r\nundertaking macroeconomic adjustment policies and\r\nimplementing financial reforms. We were keen to reduce\r\nthe risks and the vulnerabilities to external developments.\r\nWe began to take austerity measures late last year, the so-\r\ncalled International Monetary Fund (IMF) package\r\nwithout the IMF: a massive cut in government spending,\r\na massive cut in credit expansion from nearly 30 per cent\r\nto 15 per cent by the end of 1998, and the imposition of\r\nthe tightest monetary and fiscal policy. But these did not\r\nseem to work. They made our problems worse. Although\r\nto some extent we managed to keep the economy\r\noperating at a relatively high rate of employment, strains\r\nwere increasingly felt in the financial system. Yet, in spite\r\nof those measures, Malaysia still got poor ratings from\r\nthe rating agencies.\r\nIt is clear that efforts to restore stability require not\r\njust domestic efforts but a concerted effort on the part of\r\nthe international community. We need greater\r\ninternational cooperation to deal with the risks and\r\nchallenges associated with this newly emerging\r\nenvironment. However, a year has passed and, despite\r\nseveral proposals made by us and others to strengthen the\r\narchitecture of the international monetary system, no\r\nconcrete measures have been forthcoming. There seems\r\nto be little sense of urgency on the part of world financial\r\nleaders to act decisively to contain the current crisis.\r\nAlthough the affected economies have undertaken strong\r\neconomic and financial reforms aimed at restoring\r\nconfidence, that same sense of urgency is lacking on the\r\npart of world financial leaders with respect to changing\r\nthe financial environment in which we all operate. There\r\nis an urgent need for this to be recognized by the\r\ninternational community, and for us to seek a permanent\r\nsolution together.\r\nMalaysia no longer sees the prospect of a global\r\neconomic crisis and breakdown in the international\r\nfinancial system as merely a remote possibility if the\r\ninternational community fails to act urgently. We all must\r\ntake a serious view of this possible development and plan\r\nmeasures to avoid such a catastrophe. In the absence of\r\nany serious intervention on the part of world financial\r\nleaders, this economic turmoil may deepen further, and\r\nthe developing countries will need to take measures to\r\nprotect themselves from the destabilizing effects of\r\ncapital-market volatility until effective and viable\r\nalternative solutions are found.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nThe case for restricting international flows is a\r\nsensible one. The control on outflows of capital would\r\nallow governments, at least in a limited time-frame, to\r\ncombine a fixed exchange rate with lower interest rates to\r\nget the real economy moving back on track. There does not\r\nappear to be any other recourse or any other workable\r\nalternative to protect a country against the volatility of\r\nsudden capital flows.\r\nMalaysia’s has always been an open economy. We\r\nremain committed to the market mechanism and to the\r\ntrend towards liberalization. Once there is a discernable\r\nnormalization in the financial markets, Malaysia will return\r\nto free capital flows. Until that time, we feel there is a need\r\nto de-link the country from the destabilizing effects of such\r\nflows.\r\nMalaysia would like to repeat its call to the\r\ninternational community to urgently review the current\r\ninternational financial-market mechanism. This review\r\nshould look into ways and means of strengthening the\r\nsystem, providing effective safeguards and setting proper\r\nrules of the game. Far-reaching reforms of the international\r\nfinancial system are necessary to prevent countries from\r\nturning back the clock on liberalization. International\r\nmonetary standards need to be developed to ensure that any\r\nfuture crisis can be properly managed by all parties\r\nconcerned. All these suggestions merit serious study if the\r\ninternational community does not want to see the process\r\nof financial liberalization being eroded by the lack of\r\nconfidence in its promised benefits. Malaysia feels that the\r\nUnited Nations has an important role to play in this regard\r\nthrough the promotion of dialogues such as this one.\r\nWe also note with keen interest President Bill\r\nClinton’s announcement three days ago in New York on\r\nconvening a meeting of the finance ministers of the Group\r\nof Seven and of key emerging economies in Washington\r\nwithin 30 days to look into ways to strengthen the world\r\nfinancial system. That meeting is long overdue. We hope\r\nthat the deliberations at the meeting will include concrete\r\nmeasures to regulate currency markets, the root cause of the\r\ncurrent financial crisis.\r\nI wish to restate that our experience with unfettered\r\nglobalization and liberalization has shown that the risks of\r\nglobalization are as real as its potential benefits. What has\r\ntaken years to build can easily be destroyed in a matter of\r\nmonths. We should not tolerate a situation where nations\r\ncan be impoverished overnight, with all the attendant\r\nserious economic, political and social consequences.\r\nMalaysia believes that development should not be a zero-\r\nsum game, with one party gaining at the expense of\r\nothers. We believe that there are more than enough\r\nresources in the world that can be shared by all if we\r\nallow rational and moral imperatives to take precedence\r\nover greed and exploitation.\r\nThat is the only sure way to ensure that weak and\r\nvulnerable members of the international community will\r\nnot be marginalized in the process of globalization. W e\r\nhope, too, that the lessons of the South-East Asian\r\nfinancial crisis will be well learned by other members of\r\nthe international community.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Bolivia.\r\nMr. Jordán Pando (Bolivia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): I wish to extend my country’s congratulations\r\nto Mr. Opertti on his well-deserved election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. It is my pleasure to commend him on the\r\nthoughtful analysis he delivered this morning to all\r\nparticipants in this high-level dialogue.\r\nThe achievements of the four United Nations\r\nDevelopment Decades are sufficient to call international\r\nattention to the fact that the gap between developed and\r\nunderdeveloped countries and between rich and poor has\r\ngrown wider. Fifteen per cent of the world’s population\r\nreceives 85 per cent of its income. In other words, 85 per\r\ncent of the population enjoys barely 15 per cent of the\r\nwealth. Moreover, this is the result not only of the 1,998\r\nyears of the Christian era, but also of 7,000 years of\r\npolitical, economic and social history, during which every\r\nideology and every sector of the civilian and military\r\npopulation has held sway. Unfortunately, this means that\r\nwe are manufacturing poverty.\r\nIn earlier decades, we talked of economic and social\r\ndevelopment for all and sought harmonious development.\r\nNowadays, we are expected to limit our thinking to\r\nsustainable and sustained development, which is a\r\nrestricted form of development. Not every segment of the\r\npopulation or every economic, productive or social sector\r\ncan achieve it, because they do not enjoy the appropriate\r\nconditions.\r\nThe former type of development and past decades\r\ntook place within the so-called economic dirigisme that\r\narose in the United States and the developed world after\r\nthe 1929 crisis, but emerging protectionism and economic\r\nliberalism existed alongside one another. In the new\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\ninternational situation of the 1980s, there arose the\r\nliberalization of markets, the social market economy and\r\nneo-liberalism. It could also be concluded that, while this\r\neconomic liberalism thrives, it coexists with protectionism,\r\nbecause the so-called liberalization of the markets is highly\r\nrelative. It includes corporate and commercial ways of\r\nlimiting or eliminating free competition, covert monopolies,\r\noligopolies or periods of exclusivity, as external private\r\nmonopolies are called in my country. The day it becomes\r\npossible to eliminate free competition, a new political\r\neconomy and a new era will have been conceived.\r\nAs the American professor of economics Paul\r\nSamuelson has said, the world has almost always lived with\r\na mixed economy, which, judging by its results, seems to\r\nbe the most fruitful.\r\nIn the current situation, one contemporary\r\nphenomenon is known as globalization. It connotes\r\nmercantilism and conglomeration, which are clearly current\r\nphenomena. In its application, however, it reiterates\r\nscientifically and academically the Spanish term\r\nmundialización, which is not a rejection of globalization but\r\nmeans that we have to understand globalization, with all its\r\nmergers and agreements between the largest and most\r\nspecialized companies in the real world. Globalization can\r\nbenefit the most industrialized countries, those with the\r\nmost sophisticated technology, the largest developing\r\ncountries. However, it can do harm to the economically\r\nmid-sized and small ones and mean nothing or even be\r\nharmful to the marginalized.\r\nGlobalization may also have other consequences, such\r\nas poverty, which is cumulative, and unemployment.\r\nTechnically and scientifically, it is possible neither to\r\neradicate nor to alleviate poverty and unemployment\r\nwithout establishing factors for creating and amassing social\r\ncapital, just as conglomeration establishes factors for\r\ncreating and amassing private capital. The task of\r\ndevelopment is to address both kinds of globalization, and\r\nwith the world divided between developed, less\r\nunderdeveloped, underdeveloped, backward and marginal\r\ncountries, one must speak also of the mundialización of\r\nthese manifestations of globalization.\r\nWith regard to the economy, it should be noted that\r\nour regional economic commissions have postulated a new\r\ntheory that could be called an economy of solidarity, a\r\nnecessary synthesis of past economy, which was always\r\nmixed. Let conglomeration exist, since it is impossible to\r\navoid; but there should be less of it so that redistribution\r\ncan increase. Less concentration and greater redistribution\r\nwould end poverty to some extent and alleviate the most\r\nserious cases. It would also ease unemployment through\r\nthe creation of jobs.\r\nIt should also be said that current methods used by\r\nthe international multilateral agencies for measuring the\r\neconomy are insufficient. Only the arithmetic of\r\ndevelopment is used to record the indices of the formal\r\neconomy, as if it were the global economy, which it is\r\nnot. There are no regular standards established to gauge\r\nthe informal economy, which has increased in all\r\ncountries, and the illegal or illicit economy, which is\r\nbased not only on drugs, but on contraband, arms and\r\nother categories. This three-dimensional measure would\r\ngive a real idea of the total global economy.\r\nFinally, I wish to mention another aspect of great\r\nimportance to our countries and to the United Nations:\r\ndevelopment financing. We are very concerned that the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme has gone from\r\nbeing a development-finance agency to one that solely\r\nadministers donations. This is very serious for small\r\ncountries, the relatively less developed, most backward\r\nand marginal, because donors finance that which interests\r\nthem and not what the countries at that level of social and\r\neconomic development desire. There are also other\r\npolitical implications, because these countries, being what\r\nthey are, would cease to be the targets of social and\r\neconomic development. Their relative autonomy of\r\ndevelopment would shrink drastically in direct relation to\r\ntheir degree of development.\r\nThe issue of financing development must be\r\nconfronted. The financing capacity of the industrialized\r\ncountries that provide donations and financing — which\r\nhas never reached 0.7 per cent of gross national product\r\n— should be formalized in some way, for there is\r\ncurrently no such system to do so. Furthermore, the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) must\r\nalso undergo essential reforms and adjustments, or donor\r\ncountries will not want to cooperate in the manner\r\nproposed. In that way, part of the portion of donors\u0027 gross\r\nnational product would continue to go to UNDP so that\r\nit can continue to act as a financing body, and part would\r\ncontinue to go to financing contributions. However, there\r\nwould have to be a development programme which\r\ncountries, organizations, civil society, agencies and the\r\nsocial, public and private sectors could follow as a point\r\nof reference.\r\nThe very important debate begun today has helped\r\nshow that there are problems in the current international\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\neconomic financial situation. It is not ideal, and it therefore\r\nrequires adjustments and modifications. The time for\r\njustifications has passed, and concern has emerged about\r\nthe unforeseen problems which have broken out. The reality\r\ngleaned from results — not from theoretical speculations —\r\nis the best teacher with regard to procedures. That same\r\nreality is a warning to pay attention to the social aspects\r\nwhich have been ignored and which may grow and lead to\r\nfuture explosions, as the current President of the World\r\nBank indicated. The former Executive Director of the\r\nUnited Nations Children\u0027s Fund, James Grant, said that\r\nsocial aspects cannot be sacrificed for the sake of\r\neconomics, production and speculation.\r\nThe great changes that have occurred have been more\r\nin the facile nature of all or nothing, winners and losers,\r\nthan in that of making intelligent progress towards synthesis\r\nrather than exclusion. The truth is that neither protectionism\r\nnor liberalization has provided the answers that our\r\nsocieties require, for inequity still persists. However,\r\nnobody can return to the past. We must forge ahead; but let\r\nus learn to do something to overcome unbalanced solutions.\r\nThe current problems we all share in the world do not lend\r\nthemselves to partial answers; they require overall solutions.\r\nIt is true that our Organization must pursue reform, as\r\nmust UNDP. At another level, regional groups, the Group\r\nof 77, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the\r\nfinancial bodies of the system, such as the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank, should build upon\r\nnew experiences and pay close attention to agreed\r\ndecisions — in short, they must modernize themselves in\r\norder to confront the problems by which are being\r\noverpowered and taken by surprise.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nMr. Oleksandr Brodsky, Deputy Chairman of the National\r\nAgency for Development and European Integration of\r\nUkraine.\r\nMr. Brodsky (Ukraine) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nToday\u0027s discussion is a natural extension of the dialogue\r\nwhich began this year in the Economic and Social Council.\r\nIt convincingly shows that issues of globalization and inter-\r\nrelated economies are key factors in the current stage of\r\nworld development. The results of the exchange of views\r\nin the Council on problems of developing international\r\ntrade in the context of globalization and the impact of\r\nfinancial crises on the world economy confirm the fact that\r\nthe United Nations is an appropriate forum to hold that type\r\nof dialogue. We feel that the consideration at the United\r\nNations of timely socio-economic problems through\r\ndialogue will make an important contribution to laying the\r\nbasis for a global partnership for development.\r\nThe appearance on the world stage of a group of\r\nnewly independent States, including Ukraine, has given\r\nthe process of the globalization of the world economy a\r\nqualitatively new dimension. In this context, there is\r\nconsiderable significance to helping in the natural process\r\nof integrating the countries of Eastern Europe into the\r\nEuropean and world economic systems. Unfortunately, we\r\nmust note that as Ukraine and other countries in transition\r\nhave entered the global economic system, we have\r\nencountered some difficulties, both of an external and of\r\na domestic nature.\r\nAmong the problems of an external nature, first of\r\nall, we have the difficulties related to the establishment of\r\nUkraine as an equal partner in the international market for\r\ngoods and services: tariff barriers, inadequate\r\nliberalization of world trade, anti-dumping processes and\r\nthe consequences of the global economic crisis.\r\nWe are very much aware that a number of domestic\r\nproblems are related to the fact that the reforms in\r\nUkraine began late and that there has been a lack of\r\ncoordination at the macroeconomic and microeconomic\r\nlevels, that there has been an inadequate implementation\r\nof structural reforms, and that there has been inadequate\r\ncoordination among the various branches of government.\r\nWe have noted a significant worsening of common\r\nproblems in Ukraine as a result of restructuring the\r\neconomy and shifting to a market system. These\r\nproblems — which include an increase in crime, drug\r\ntrafficking and a number of other anti-social\r\nphenomena — have also been the result of the need for\r\na massive conversion of the military-industrial complex\r\nand for a reduction of the size of the army, which has\r\nsubsequently caused an increase in unemployment and\r\nsocial disintegration. Today, Government activities are\r\nactively geared towards resolving these problems and\r\nmaintaining the political stability and social harmony of\r\nthe country.\r\nUkraine has already completed the privatization of\r\nsmall enterprises and has significantly hastened the\r\nprivatization of medium and large-scale enterprises. In our\r\nview, this should promote the flow of foreign investment,\r\nwhich is one of the levers of the process of\r\nglobalization that characterizes the development of today\u0027s\r\nworld economy.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nUkraine has carried out substantial reforms in its\r\nforeign trade in order to liberalize it and harmonize it with\r\ngeneral standards and norms. We have completely abolished\r\nnon-tariff regulation. We have done away completely with\r\nthe system of State orders and contracts and are\r\nestablishing a radically new system of tariff regulations.\r\nAnd we are further perfecting our system of certification\r\nand standardization. Special attention is being given to\r\nreforming the agricultural sector, to hastening land reform\r\nand to restructuring and privatizing agro-industrial\r\nenterprises. Very important significance is being attached to\r\npractical support for reform measures by the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank. An important element\r\nin the Government\u0027s economic programme is appropriate\r\nexternal financing, in particular, maintaining the balance of\r\npayments.\r\nUkraine is today actively moving forward towards\r\nEuropean integration and is cooperating with other States at\r\nthe regional and subregional levels. Ukraine\u0027s special\r\nattitude towards integration into the European Union is\r\nbased on its understanding that such integration is a factor\r\nin helping to strengthen its own independence as a State, its\r\neconomic security, its political stability and its social\r\nharmony, and it is also helpful to its successful economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe entry into force on 1 March 1998 of the\r\nPartnership and Cooperation Agreement between Ukraine\r\nand the European Union has meant that we are in a\r\nqualitatively new stage in the development of our relations\r\nwith the European Union. In our view, this will reflect\r\npositively on our trade and economic relations and will\r\npromote the adoption of Ukraine\u0027s legislation to conform\r\nwith the norms of the European Union.\r\nUkraine is trying to give a fresh impulse to interaction\r\nat the regional level and has participated in the activities of\r\na recently established regional organization, the Black Sea\r\nEconomic Cooperation group, which has the goal of\r\npromoting the strengthening of cooperation of countries in\r\nthe region.\r\nAn international conference was held in Ukraine at the\r\nbeginning of September this year to mark the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nThe conference brought together representatives from more\r\nthan 30 countries. Participants noted that stable economic\r\ndevelopment in the world is impossible without observing\r\nthe rights and freedoms of each and every inhabitant of our\r\nplanet. We feel that mutual cooperation and development\r\nshould respond primarily to the main parameters of social\r\nequality and well-being.\r\nCarrying out such international measures — in\r\nparticular the annual meeting of the European Bank for\r\nReconstruction and Development in Kiev and meetings of\r\nmember States of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nin Yalta — attests to the authority of Ukraine as a reliable\r\npolitical and economic partner and is a signal to other\r\ncountries of its policy of integration into the world and\r\nEuropean economic systems.\r\nUnder the present conditions of globalization, there\r\nis a need to safeguard the positive results achieved by the\r\ncountries in transition and to prevent any further\r\nmarginalization of the poorest countries. The rapid\r\ncompletion of the process of transition to a market\r\neconomy will have a positive impact on the stabilization\r\nof the world economic system.\r\nIn this context, technical assistance to those countries\r\nis very important, in particular the transfer of modern\r\ntechnology on preferential terms, in order to ensure their\r\naccess to world markets, attract financial flows from those\r\nmarkets and help them become integrated into the global\r\neconomic trading system.\r\nIt has been noted repeatedly in various forums that\r\nthe end of the East-West ideological confrontation has\r\ncreated a qualitatively new situation in the world. Neither\r\nthe major Powers, regional associations nor even\r\nuniversal organizations such as the United Nations can\r\nresolve such global problems as preventing conflicts and\r\nglobal financial crises or eliminating poverty, international\r\nterrorism and drug trafficking. That can be done only\r\nthrough joint, coordinated efforts on the part of the United\r\nNations and other international organizations and will\r\nrequire an adaptation to current realities and the ability to\r\nresolve complex contemporary problems.\r\nThe United Nations today is engaged in a process of\r\nradical reform, which Ukraine actively supports. We note\r\nwith satisfaction that our country was among those States\r\nthat helped to hasten that process. In our view, the goals\r\nof this radical reform of the United Nations, and in\r\nparticular of its social and economic sector, should be\r\nadequately to reflect the interests of all countries and\r\ncontinents and should involve concrete actions and\r\ntangible results for people the world over.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nPermanent Representative of the United Republic of\r\nTanzania.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania): At\r\nthe outset, allow me to join other speakers in expressing my\r\ndelegation\u0027s congratulations on Mr. Didier Opertti\u0027s election\r\nto the presidency of the fifty-third session.\r\nLet me now turn to the agenda item under\r\nconsideration. The process of globalization and\r\ninterdependence is not a new phenomenon. Its roots can be\r\ntraced as far back as the late nineteenth century. Today,\r\nhowever, globalization has taken on a new shape. Two key\r\nplayers in this process have emerged. On the one hand, we\r\nhave the transnational corporations, which dominate\r\ninvestment, production and trade in the world economy. On\r\nthe other hand, we have the international financial\r\ninstitutions, which control the world of finance. Distinct\r\nfrom the earlier form of globalization is the increasing\r\ndegree of openness, growing economic interdependence and\r\ndeepening economic integration beyond national boundaries.\r\nIn all forms, however, the driving forces are the desire to\r\nmaximize profits and therefore compete in a seemingly\r\ncontracting market.\r\nBecause no country can live in isolation, globalization\r\nhas become an inevitable phenomenon. Under globalization,\r\ndeveloped and developing countries alike have been put\r\ninto one basket without regard to their differing levels of\r\ndevelopment, as we are told that globalization stands to\r\nbenefit all countries. We are told in particular that\r\nglobalization is likely to open up many new opportunities\r\nto developing countries for them to expand and diversify\r\ntheir economies.\r\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, globalization is\r\nassociated with competition. We all know that competition\r\nmeans “survival of the fittest”. And this is where the major\r\nproblem arises, as inequalities and the uneven nature of the\r\nglobalization process begin to unfold. To be candid, the\r\nprime beneficiaries are those who control the transnationals\r\nand the financial institutions. This leaves many developing\r\ncountries, particularly the least developed, excluded and\r\nvulnerable to external factors that are beyond their control.\r\nGlobalization and trade liberalization have contributed\r\nsignificantly to the growth of international trade and capital\r\nflows. This in turn has made it possible to improve the\r\nglobal division of labour and the allocation of savings and\r\ninvestments. Indeed, one could add that the conclusion of\r\nthe Uruguay Round has led to a reduction of tariffs and the\r\nremoval of quotas, thereby increasing market access for\r\nproducts from developing countries.\r\nIn spite of the impressive volume of trade on a\r\nglobal scale, trade liberalization remains uneven and faces\r\nmajor challenges that obstruct the achievement of an\r\nopen, mutually beneficial and rule-based multilateral\r\ntrading system. Developing countries stand to benefit little\r\nfrom the Uruguay Round if many of the key provisions of\r\nparticular interest to them are left unimplemented. The\r\nprovisions deal with exports of particular importance to\r\ndeveloping countries, including those in sectors where\r\nsubstantial tariff liberalization has been achieved and\r\nthose sectors characterized by dynamic export growth.\r\nThe declining importance of primary commodities in\r\nworld trade, coupled with a loss of market share in world\r\nprimary commodity markets, puts developing countries in\r\na comparatively weak position to benefit from\r\nglobalization. The situation is aggravated by the declining\r\nresources, particularly official development assistance,\r\nthat are made available to developing countries. Foreign\r\ndirect investment has grown, and is growing,\r\nastronomically, but is very selective and highly uneven.\r\nWorse still, rules on technology transfer now prevent\r\nthose countries from adopting more modern technologies\r\nfor their own development. In the end, those countries\u0027\r\nefforts to industrialize have been thwarted.\r\nIt is quite evident, therefore, that the benefits of\r\nintegration into the world economy through globalization\r\nwill accrue only to those countries which have laid the\r\nrequisite foundations for industrialization and\r\ndevelopment. For the many developing countries whose\r\ncapacity to invest is low, globalization will continue to\r\nexpose them to further marginalization. At this juncture\r\nit is heartening to record the unequivocal position of the\r\nGovernment of the Netherlands on development assistance\r\nto developing countries. It is my delegation\u0027s hope that\r\nother developed countries will emulate that positive\r\nexample.\r\nGlobalization has had other consequences on the\r\ndeveloping countries. Due to low income resulting from\r\npoor export revenues, these countries have become more\r\ndependent on foreign borrowing in order to meet their\r\nobligations. As a result, the foreign debt has become a\r\nmore serious problem, affecting Governments\u0027 delivery of\r\nsocial services to their citizens. In Tanzania, for example,\r\nthe total committed debt increased to $7.9 billion in 1997,\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 5th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 17 September 1998\r\nas compared to $7.8 billion for 1996. The Government\u0027s\r\ncapacity to service the external debt as measured by the\r\ndebt export ratio has been declining despite the fact that\r\nexport earnings have grown in recent years. The rate of\r\ngrowth of external debt has indeed tended to surpass the\r\nrate of growth of exports. Despite the Government\u0027s efforts\r\nto honour its external debt obligations, the outstanding debt\r\nstock continues to accumulate. This has raised the cost-of-\r\nliving index, putting the lives of many of our citizens in\r\nserious jeopardy. Needless to say, the number of poor\r\npeople has also increased. The debt issue needs to be\r\naddressed seriously.\r\nThere is a need for the international community to\r\ndevise a mechanism to oversee the various issues arising\r\nfrom growing interdependence. This mechanism must take\r\ninto consideration the needs of the developing countries, if\r\nthey are to benefit from the process. Otherwise, there is a\r\nreal danger that developing countries will experience\r\nexclusion and, therefore, continue being marginalized. If\r\nthis happens, their chances for development will diminish,\r\nwhile the gap between the rich North and the poor South\r\nwill widen even further, to the detriment of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.45 p.m.\r\n33\r\n"
