(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mra (Myanmar),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 5.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 93 (continued)\r\nSustainable development and international economic\r\ncooperation\r\n(d) Renewal of the dialogue on strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership\r\nHigh-level dialogue on the theme of the social and\r\neconomic impact of globalization and\r\ninterdependence and their policy implications\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Lesotho.\r\nMr. Mangoaela (Lesotho): It is an honour for me to\r\naddress the Assembly on this important and timely topic.\r\nLet me at the outset associate myself with the views\r\nexpressed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia,\r\nwho spoke on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThis high-level dialogue of the General Assembly is\r\nyet another perfect demonstration of what the international\r\ncommunity had in mind when negotiating the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment. The Agenda recognizes that:\r\n“The United Nations occupies a unique position for\r\naddressing the challenges of promoting development\r\nin the context of the globalization of the world\r\neconomy and deepening interdependence among\r\nnations. It must play a central and more active and\r\neffective role in promoting international cooperation\r\nfor development and providing policy guidance on\r\nglobal development issues.” (A/51/45, para. 233)\r\nThe least developed countries, of which Lesotho is\r\none, face substantial supply-side constraints that impede\r\ntheir efforts at taking advantage of the globalized\r\neconomy and liberalized markets. These problems are\r\ncompounded by the external debt problem, which in turn\r\nis exacerbated by the decline in official development\r\nassistance. We therefore call on the international\r\ncommunity to intensify its assistance to the least\r\ndeveloped countries by meeting the target of 0.15 per cent\r\nto 0.2 per cent of their gross national product, as\r\ncontained in the Paris Declaration, as well as the\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries,\r\nso that they may have a reasonable chance of building the\r\ncapacity required for successful integration into the global\r\neconomy. Otherwise, opportunities associated with\r\nglobalization, such as those inherent in the Uruguay\r\nRound, will continue to elude the least developed\r\ncountries. And in this age of interdependence of national\r\neconomies, the continuation of this marginalization is not\r\nin the best interest of the global economy.\r\nVarious studies leading to the Uruguay Round\r\nshowed that developing countries would realize\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nsubstantial income gains from trade liberalization. One of\r\nthose studies, done by the World Bank, estimated such\r\ngains at $171 billion, with approximately one third of this\r\naccruing to developing countries.\r\nTrade liberalization and deregulation following the\r\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round and the establishment of\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) were seen as\r\nbringing in a new period of international prosperity in\r\nwhich developing countries were expected to share through\r\nimproved access to markets.\r\nIndeed, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations resulted in a more open, rule-based and\r\npredictable trading system and in significant improvements\r\nin market access conditions. Furthermore, since the\r\nestablishment of the WTO, important multilateral\r\nnegotiations have been concluded that have increased\r\nmarket access for information technology products, basic\r\ntelecommunications services and financial services. The\r\ndispute settlement mechanism of the WTO, which\r\nstrengthens the multilateral trading system, provides an\r\nefficient and effective recourse for defending market access\r\nrights.\r\nHowever, the expected gains for the least developed\r\ncountries from the stimulus to world trade arising from the\r\nUruguay Round are less clear. They continue to face\r\nsignificant obstacles to market access for their exports.\r\nThere are still tariff peaks and tariff escalations against\r\ntheir major export items. Furthermore, some standards are\r\ntoo difficult to meet due to the differences in technological\r\nadvancement.\r\nCooperation arrangements within the ambit of\r\neconomic and technical cooperation among developing\r\ncountries can be used as conduits for realizing the benefits\r\nof globalization and liberalization. Within regional and\r\nsubregional cooperative mechanisms, there is a\r\nhomogeneity of norms and standards in various areas. If\r\nthis homogenization of norms and standards is unique to the\r\nregional set-up and it operates efficiently and effectively, it\r\nmay serve as a model to be duplicated in the broader\r\ninternational system. Alternatively, if the norms and\r\nstandards in the regional context are similar to those\r\ndemanded by the global community, then this enhances the\r\nintegration of the developing countries into the world\r\neconomy.\r\nIn this context, South-South cooperation is properly\r\nplaced to serve the interests of the global economy and of\r\nall members of the international community. It is therefore\r\npertinent to encourage countries of the North to provide\r\nincreasing support to South-South development efforts\r\nthrough, among others, triangular cooperation. The\r\nmodalities of such cooperation are likely to be implied\r\nfrom the series of meetings comprising the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD).\r\nTICAD I, held in Tokyo in October 1993, advocated\r\nstrong South-South cooperation and stressed the need for\r\nAfrica-Asia cooperation. TICAD II, to be held on 19-21\r\nOctober, is projected to provide a programme of action\r\nfor Africa’s development in the next century as well as\r\nadopt a pragmatic framework for enhancing cooperation\r\nbetween Africa and Asia, including Japan.\r\nThe developing countries, and in particular the least\r\ndeveloped among them, face several constraints that are\r\nimpediments to seizing the advantages inherent in the\r\nglobalized economy. These are: first, weak technological\r\ncapacity; secondly, paucity of requisite skills in the\r\nmarketing, entrepreneurial and quality control fields;\r\nthirdly, shortage of long-term finance and expensive trade\r\ncredit; and fourthly, lack of transparency in the legal and\r\nregulatory framework.\r\nIn addition to these factors, the least developed\r\ncountries tend to be heavily reliant on an economic base\r\nof commodities that are either non-processed or are semi-\r\nprocessed. The decline in commodity prices, which has\r\nbeen exacerbated by the financial crisis of East Asia and\r\nother parts of the world, has had a devastating effect on\r\nthe fortunes of the least developed countries, whose\r\ncommodity producers now find themselves confronted\r\nwith a situation of weak demand, large supplies and\r\nincreasing stocks. Meanwhile, these countries depend on\r\ncommodity prices for, on average, a third of their export\r\nearnings.\r\nThe heavy debt overhang of the low-income\r\ncountries continues to be a hindrance to their investment\r\nand growth potential. This has undoubtedly been\r\nexacerbated by the recent financial turbulence in some\r\nparts of the world. Insufficient funding remains the major\r\nconstraint to the success of the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative. It is also necessary that\r\nthe Initiative’s eligibility criteria be made flexible and\r\ninclusive. While a number of past measures and policies\r\nhave been helpful in alleviating the problem to achieve a\r\ndurable solution, serious consideration should be given to\r\nthe proposals for providing additional resources without\r\ndiverting funds from development assistance.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nIn the context of the debt burden and the supply-side\r\nimpediments of the developing countries, we view with\r\ndeep concern the continuing decline of official development\r\nassistance, particularly as it is a major external source of\r\nfinancing for development and is a crucial input for\r\ninfrastructure and social development. Its further decline\r\ntherefore means the worsening marginalization of least\r\ndeveloped countries in a world economy increasingly being\r\nshaped by the processes of globalization and liberalization.\r\nTo enable the least developed countries to benefit from and\r\nto sustain the structural and economic reforms that they\r\nhave undertaken, it is essential that the flow of external\r\nresources to these countries be increased and their efforts\r\nat capacity-building and infrastructure development\r\nsupported.\r\nThis high-level dialogue has offered us a chance to\r\ndevise strategies for seizing the opportunities provided by\r\nglobalization and liberalization while at the same time\r\nexploring ways of mitigating their adverse effects on those\r\ncountries that lack the wherewithal to take advantage of\r\nthem. The dialogue has hopefully attained the objective\r\nenvisaged for it, namely, the strengthening of international\r\neconomic cooperation for development through partnership\r\nbetween developed and developing countries.\r\nMr. Calovski (The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): The views of my delegation coincide with\r\nthose expressed by the representative of Austria speaking\r\non behalf of the European Union. Let me begin my brief\r\nstatement by expressing the hope that the discussions of this\r\nhigh-level dialogue will help the deliberations of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and other forums concerned with the\r\nconsequences of globalization, as well as the policies of\r\nMember States’ Governments and of relevant regional\r\norganizations such as the European Union. It will be\r\nimportant if we can have, in due time, a follow-up analysis\r\nof the deliberations of this forum prepared by the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nAlthough a lot has been written and said about the\r\nglobalization of the world economy, many aspects of its\r\nimplications remain unclear. This is so because, as we all\r\nknow, globalization as a phenomenon is a quality change;\r\nit is a living creature, if I may say so. So, for some time,\r\nmaybe even for a long time, we are going to struggle to\r\ndiscover its implications, positive or negative, for our\r\nindividual economies and for international economic\r\ncooperation. The fact that we have entered a period of full\r\ndependence from a period of managed interdependence has\r\nsomething to do with that.\r\nIn the context of globalization, we have to worry at\r\npresent about our national economies. We have to follow\r\nand worry about the economy of our partners, of our\r\nneighbours, of our region and of our continent, and the\r\nglobal economy. We have to do all that at the same time.\r\nOtherwise, if we do not, we will not be able to use our\r\ncompetitiveness. We will be unable to prevent the\r\nnegative consequences of globalization, and our economy\r\ncould be marginalized. And that is the worst that can\r\nhappen to any economy, to the small and weakened ones\r\nin particular.\r\nIf the intention is to improve international economic\r\ncooperation, one of the priority tasks of the General\r\nAssembly should be to prevent marginalization of the\r\nsmall and weakened economies. Alone, they are unable to\r\nfight the dangers of the marginalization. So, what could\r\nbe the answer to the present situation of dependence,\r\nsince in the context of globalization there is no\r\nindependence, particularly for small and weakened\r\neconomies?\r\nThe answer, of course, is always a very complex\r\none. You will find it in the need to change the present\r\npolitical, economic and social priorities. The present\r\nproblems in the world economy, to a large extent, are\r\ngenerated by the fact that the globalization of the world\r\neconomy is not parallel to the globalization of the\r\ninternational political relations. It is clear that we need\r\nglobal action, United Nations action, to change the\r\npresent priorities, and that change should be managed.\r\nThe first priority, in our view, of United Nations\r\naction should be the prevention of conflicts and finding\r\nsolutions for ongoing ones. This can be achieved through\r\nstrict compliance with the Charter and, as far as the\r\nUnited Nations is concerned, by strengthening the role of\r\nthe General Assembly, which in the future should work\r\nas a parliament of nations, all year round.\r\nThe second priority should be the adoption of an\r\nopen border foreign policy by all Member States in\r\naccordance with the Charter. There should be no\r\nrestrictions on the circulation of capital, goods, services\r\nor people. The liberalization of international trade and of\r\neconomic cooperation should be parallel with the\r\nliberalization of international political relations. In the\r\ncontext of our discussion, the enhancement of political\r\nand economic integration, particularly from the point of\r\nview of small and weakened economies, is essential. For\r\nmy country, the Republic of Macedonia, and for those\r\nfrom my region, it is essential that our economies be fully\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nintegrated into the economy of the European Union and into\r\nEuro-Atlantic institutions. Hesitation in this respect is\r\nsimply unhealthy.\r\nIn order to stop the marginalization of many\r\neconomies, special measures by the United Nations, by the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and by regional economic\r\norganizations such as the European Union should be\r\nadopted and implemented, particularly with regard to\r\nmarket access and direct investments. Without undertaking\r\nsuch relevant measures, achieving economic growth, low\r\ninflation, and so on, will be difficult.\r\nGlobalization is an irreversible trend. Marginalization\r\nis, however, preventable. It is correct that, at present, the\r\nmain concern is the situation of the bigger economies in\r\nEuro-Asia and Latin America. It will be an inexcusable\r\nmistake, however, if the small and weakened economies are\r\nforgotten, marginalized.\r\nI have mentioned some concerns. Of course, there are\r\nmany others. The essential thing that I wanted to underline\r\nat this global forum is that we cannot speak anymore of an\r\nindependent economy and that we are all responsible for the\r\nnegative consequences of globalization. This requires that\r\nglobalization be managed at the national and international\r\nlevels. The experience of my country suggests that at home\r\nwe should pursue the policy of continuous adaptation to\r\nchange required by the globalization of international\r\nrelations, and abroad we should pursue the promotion of the\r\nintegration of our economy into the European Union.\r\nWe have entered the period of full dependence and,\r\nwithin that framework, we should try to find solutions to\r\nthe present problems generated by globalization. The\r\nconclusions of the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/53/1) can serve as a good base\r\nfor the preparation of the needed United Nations action.\r\nManaging the adverse effects of globalization and\r\nstrengthening multilateral institutions are essential in order\r\nto harness the positive potentials of globalization.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to inform you that my delegation, together with\r\nsome others, is planning to submit to the Second\r\nCommittee of the General Assembly a draft resolution on\r\nglobalization and liberalization of the world economy and\r\nprevention of marginalization of small and weakened\r\neconomies of developing countries and of economies in\r\ntransition. The draft resolution will affirm the importance\r\nof the statement of the Secretary-General in his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization:\r\n“The task ahead, therefore, is not to try to\r\nreverse globalization — an effort which, in any case,\r\nwould be futile. The task is to harness its positive\r\npotential while managing its adverse effects.\r\nStrengthening multilateral institutions can help\r\naccomplish that task.” (A/53/1, para. 234)\r\nAnd considering the urgent need to prevent further\r\nmarginalization of the small and weakened economies of\r\ndeveloping countries and of economies in transition, and\r\nto help these economies benefit from the globalization\r\nand liberalization of the world economy, the draft\r\nresolution will call upon Member States to take,\r\nindividually and collectively, the needed relevant\r\nmeasures and policies to prevent the marginalization of\r\ndeveloping countries’ small and weakened economies as\r\nwell as economies in transition and to help them benefit\r\nfrom globalization and liberalization with a view to their\r\nfull integration into the world economy. The draft\r\nresolution will request the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, together with the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development and the\r\nExecutive Secretaries of the regional commissions to\r\nprepare an analytical report on the subject of this draft\r\nresolution and to submit it to the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fifth session.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Colombia, Mr. Jairo Montoya, Director-\r\nGeneral for Multilateral Affairs.\r\nMr. Montoya (Colombia) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me to begin by congratulating Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti on his election as President of this important\r\nbody. I would also like to express my support for the\r\nstatement made by Indonesia at the beginning of this\r\ndebate, on behalf of the Group of 77.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to this\r\ndialogue. At the same time, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress its satisfaction at having been directly involved in\r\nthe preliminary discussions on setting up this dialogue, a\r\nfew years ago.\r\nWe hope that this political dialogue will continue in\r\nthe future and will be reflected in an effective\r\ncontribution by the United Nations to the revitalization of\r\ninternational economic cooperation. We also stress that\r\nthis dialogue is being conducted under a new spirit of\r\npartnership, rather than confrontation. This new approach\r\nshould be promoted through the identification of common\r\ninterests, mutual benefits and shared responsibilities.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nBut even more importantly, we hope that the outcome\r\nand summary of this first dialogue will include the different\r\npractical measures that have been proposed in order to\r\naddress, in both the short and the long run, the economic\r\nand social impact of globalization.\r\nGlobalization has been subject to many interpretations.\r\nWe need political and conceptual clarity based on a\r\nperspective shared by the different actors. The United\r\nNations is the best place to examine this issue\r\ncomprehensively, including its political, economic, social,\r\nenvironmental and cultural dimensions. That is one of the\r\nmain reasons why this two-day discussion has been\r\nrelevant.\r\nIn this context, one of the first questions that I believe\r\nwill need further consideration is, how can globalization\r\nprovide effective and durable conditions for accelerated\r\neconomic growth so as to reduce unemployment, raise\r\nwages and reduce poverty? Secondly, how can globalization\r\nbe compatible with cultural diversity and national identity\r\nin different countries and regions? Thirdly, how can\r\nglobalization help preserve the global environment? And\r\nfinally, how can globalization lead to a democratic and\r\nparticipatory decision-making process in the economic and\r\ndevelopment fields?\r\nIn addition, it is crucial to remove external factors that\r\nlimit the scope of globalization. One of the main\r\ncontradictions in this regard is restrictions to the transborder\r\nmovement of labour. Labour is one of the most important\r\nfactors of production, but its international movement is\r\nsubject to increasing restrictions. In some countries, such\r\nlimitations have recently been intensified. In others, they\r\nwill be expanded in 1999.\r\nAnother external risk is the insistence on introducing\r\nregulations on labour and social standards as a precondition\r\nfor competing in international markets. This could lead to\r\nthe denial of opportunities to those countries whose\r\nlegitimate comparative advantages are rooted in their\r\nrelatively low labour costs. The attempt to introduce such\r\nstandards and regulations is clearly contrary to the\r\nprinciples of a free market and of liberalization.\r\nMoreover, decisive steps have to be undertaken to\r\nremove obstacles to access to know-how and technology.\r\nThe international framework on intellectual property does\r\nnot seem to be entirely consistent with the globalization\r\nprocess because it is restrictive by nature. This issue,\r\ntherefore, deserves to be revisited.\r\nOn the issue of the current financial crisis now\r\naffecting the global economy, my delegation shares the\r\nview that there is a need to establish mechanisms to\r\nensure that international monetary markets are more\r\ntransparent and predictable. Likewise, we recognize the\r\nimportance of addressing the short-term consequences of\r\nfinancial and monetary turbulence and volatility through\r\nsuch instruments as monitoring and regulation.\r\nBut my delegation is of the view that the main\r\npriority in the long term should be to focus on the\r\nmanagement of the global economy so as to ensure that\r\nthe huge amounts of monetary and financial capital it\r\ngenerates are allocated to productive activities and\r\ninfrastructure. This is the only way to correct the\r\nspeculative character that the globalization process has\r\nexhibited in recent years.\r\nIn addition, my delegation is convinced that there is\r\na need for the international community to launch a global\r\ninitiative to strengthen multilateralism. Multilateralism\r\nneeds to be revitalized with a global dimension, involving\r\nboth the United Nations and other multilateral institutions.\r\nThe ongoing validity of the majority of institutions\r\ncreated as a result of the Second World War has been\r\nreaffirmed, even after the end of the cold war. However,\r\nmany of their mechanisms have become anachronistic and\r\ninappropriate to the needs of a more open and democratic,\r\nglobalized world.\r\nTo deal with the challenges, risks and imbalances\r\nborn of globalization, and as the only way to address its\r\ngovernance and management, revitalizing multilateralism\r\nis a political, ethical and historical imperative.\r\nThe Acting President: I call next on the\r\nrepresentative of Uruguay.\r\nMr. Pérez Otermin (Uruguay) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The successive crises that have shaken the\r\nworld’s stockmarkets are but the most recent\r\nmanifestation of a process in which the power of\r\ngovernments, the role of corporations and the fate of their\r\nemployees, and national cultures are all being transformed\r\nby world economic and technological integration:\r\nglobalization.\r\nIt took 13 days for the news of the assassination of\r\nAbraham Lincoln in 1865 to cross the Atlantic and reach\r\nEurope. The plunge of the Hong Kong stock market in\r\nlate October 1997 took 13 seconds to strike, like\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nlightning, New York, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Sao\r\nPaolo and Buenos Aires. That is globalization, now a fact\r\nof life. It is not merely a fashionable term of the moment,\r\nbut represents the fusion of the radical transformations that\r\nthe world economy has been experiencing for more than a\r\ndecade.\r\nWe can say that globalization is the result of the\r\ncombination of three powerful forces: technology applied to\r\nthe search for and transmission of information; the\r\nestablishment of free-trade areas and integrated economic\r\nblocs; and the growing worldwide linkage and\r\ninterdependence of markets in goods and services and\r\nfinancial markets.\r\nIn an increasingly integrated economy, the ability to\r\ntake advantage of trade opportunities and to overcome the\r\nattendant obstacles has become a key concern for States.\r\nMany developing countries, especially low-income and least\r\ndeveloped countries, lack the capacity to institute legislative\r\nframeworks that would enable them to benefit from world\r\ntrade as a truly effective instrument to guarantee sustained\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nIn the face of liberal, outward-oriented trading\r\nregimes, developing countries are struggling to improve\r\ntheir tiny participation in world trade. The multilateral\r\ninstitutions that promote development, including the United\r\nNations, must continue to work to provide strategic\r\nassistance to developing countries in their efforts to\r\nmaximize their opportunities in the sphere of trade.\r\nOne of the gravest consequences we face in today’s\r\nglobalized world is the lack of employment opportunities.\r\nUnemployment, which in Europe has reached 11 per cent\r\nof the population of working age and which affects more\r\nthan 18 million people, is a clear indication of the\r\nmagnitude of the problem. Why is this happening? There\r\nare many, complicated factors, but first and foremost\r\namong them is the overwhelming, profound and irreversible\r\ntechnological revolution, which is lowering production\r\ncosts, but at a high social price, by replacing human skill\r\nwith sophisticated machines.\r\nIn the early years of the 1990s, employment rates\r\nconsistently fell nearly everywhere in the world. A report\r\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment notes that worldwide there are today 120\r\nmillion unemployed and 700 million underemployed.\r\nInternational Labour Organization experts have identified\r\ntwo basic causes of this phenomenon: globalization and\r\neconomic liberalization. The first is marked by the\r\nmovement and transfer of major capital flows and by the\r\nquest for highly specialized, low-cost labour. The second\r\nhas broader effects, to the point where adjustment policies\r\nmean new allocations of resources, which benefit some\r\nsectors and harm others. This has led to a new\r\nphenomenon in many parts of the world: growth without\r\njob creation.\r\nThe globalization of the economy involves the\r\nprocesses of integration and the opening up of trade; these\r\nare under way in all regions and are not coming to an\r\nend. This creates a new challenge for all countries: to\r\nacquire a competitive and specialized production\r\napparatus, which means the closing or conversion of\r\nindustries and businesses that are no longer viable and the\r\ntemporary loss of jobs.\r\nToday, we cannot think of globalization without a\r\nfull grasp of the meaning of the development of scientific\r\nand technology, which can no longer be viewed as a\r\nlesser activity. We cannot disregard the vital role of\r\nscientific and technological development as the key\r\nmotive force for growth and well-being. Scientific\r\nprogress is today a crucial tool for eradicating poverty,\r\ncreating employment opportunities, improving the quality\r\nof life, promoting culture and protecting national security.\r\nIt must thus be a priority concern for every government\r\nas it shoulders its responsibility for promoting the creation\r\nof new knowledge and for coming to grips with it. The\r\nkey to success in international competition lies in the\r\ncapacity for innovation.\r\nToday we are looking at globalization from the\r\neconomic standpoint and are therefore assessing the social\r\nconsequences of that phenomenon. But we must not\r\nforget that globalization must be conceived first and\r\nforemost as a cultural phenomenon which then becomes\r\nan economic phenomenon. Why is this? Because it is\r\nborn of science rather than of the economy. Globalization\r\nis a fact, not an ideology. It is a fact that has astonishing\r\nconsequences: in 50 years there has been a five-fold\r\nincrease in world production and a 15-fold increase in\r\ntrade flows. Hence, it has an impact on the development\r\nof capital and currencies; what increases enormously is\r\nproduction. This means that wealth is not merely the\r\nphysical or material product itself.\r\nAnother consideration worth mentioning is that\r\nglobalization has not eliminated blocs. Countries find it\r\nincreasingly necessary to supplement each other’s needs\r\nand foster free-trade spaces. That is why our country,\r\nUruguay, has sought to respond to this new challenge by\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\njoining MERCOSUR in order to accelerate and update the\r\nliberalization process and progressive association of Latin\r\nAmerica. It was not by chance that the General Agreement\r\non Tariffs and Trade negotiations were initiated in our\r\ncountry, since we felt the need to lead and promote the\r\ntrade liberalization process. Uruguay views the integration\r\nprocess as a mechanism for joining the globalized world.\r\nOur country experienced a crisis in the early 1980s\r\nand absorbed its lessons. Thus, we have since developed a\r\npolicy based on careful regulation, which today allows us\r\nto enjoy a sound and solvent financial system. Our\r\nGovernment therefore recently ratified its commitment to\r\nmeeting the economic goals established for this year and set\r\nits priorities for 1999. These priorities include an inflation\r\nindex of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent; economic\r\ngrowth of approximately 3 per cent; and a fiscal deficit of\r\napproximately 0.8 per cent, maintaining the basic balance\r\nof our economy through essential fiscal measures,\r\nspecifically in public spending.\r\nWe also support any precautionary measure that may\r\nbe adopted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to\r\nmitigate the devastating effects of the global crisis that is\r\ncurrently of such concern to us. These commendable efforts\r\nare being made not only by our country, but by the rest of\r\nthe region as well. We must all fulfil our duties — the\r\ndeveloped countries in their sphere, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions in theirs, and the various Governments in\r\ncomplex budgets of their national economies, continuing to\r\npromote the necessary structural reforms and assisted by the\r\ncompetent international agencies.\r\nThe impact of globalization on our region, and\r\nespecially the effects of the recent financial crisis, are\r\ndirectly affecting our economies. Over a year ago, when the\r\nSouth-East Asian crisis erupted, our perception of these\r\nmatters changed drastically. Latin America needs to attract\r\n$50 billion a year in private international investments in\r\norder to sustain its rate of growth. This cannot occur if the\r\ngain per risk for each country does not return to its\r\nprevious levels.\r\nNevertheless, returning to a consideration of the region\r\nas a whole, there is some fear that the loss of trust in the\r\nmarkets and the evolution of our countries may lead to a\r\nround of devaluation, which will revive inflation, thus\r\nrecreating the vicious circle of past decades. One of the\r\nmain problems is that the Asian debacle and the recent\r\nfinancial crisis in the Russian Federation have not only\r\neroded confidence in those countries, but have spread the\r\ncontagion to Latin America as part of the so-called\r\nemerging markets, without reflecting the differences in\r\ntheir domestic circumstances. In this respect, Uruguay is\r\na noteworthy exception to the rule, since the country’s\r\nnational debt is categorized at the investment level and\r\ntherefore allows outside financing at low cost.\r\nTo conclude the dialogue that has brought us\r\ntogether today, we would simply repeat the statement of\r\nour Minister of Economy and Finance at the recent\r\nmeeting of Presidents of the Central Banks and the IMF.\r\nThe Minister said:\r\n“Uruguay, as a small country, will be unable to\r\nsolve global problems, but will certainly strive to\r\navoid complicating them further.”\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to\r\nMr. Abdul-Qader Ba-Jammal, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Yemen.\r\nMr. Ba-Jammal (Yemen) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): At the outset, I extend to Mr. Opertti our\r\nwarmest congratulations on his election to the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am\r\nconfident that the Assembly’s work at this session will be\r\ncrowned with success under his able leadership.\r\nWe are discussing today an issue that preoccupies us\r\nand affects our nations’ and States’ lives and relations.\r\nThat is because it is closely linked to our destiny and\r\nfuture, as well as to the parameters and features of that\r\nfuture for the coming generations.\r\nMany of us understand that globalization is the\r\ntheoretical economic option of free trade and\r\nliberalization following the collapse of the socialist\r\neconomies and the end of the cold war in the twilight of\r\nthis century. Some of us understand that globalization is\r\na new tool to control the division of labour in the world\r\nand to maintain the status quo of the poor and consumers\r\nwithout ideological or political slogans. Each of us can\r\ninterpret globalization however it may serve national and\r\nregional economies. That is because, to date, no one can\r\nclaim that globalization is a theory or philosophy\r\nconducive to international cooperation and humanity’s\r\nhappiness.\r\nThis question requires a more comprehensive and\r\ndetailed dialogue that focuses directly on tangible matters,\r\nsuch as the terms of transportation and liberalization, the\r\nmovement of capital and investments, safeguards and\r\nfinancing. We must therefore engage in an in-depth\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\ndiscussion that concentrates on details, illuminating the\r\nissue and helping us to understand it.\r\nWe ought all to share an equal understanding of the\r\nmatter at hand. We, the group of least developed countries,\r\nview globalization with terror, because isolation and\r\nmarginalization will threaten our countries if we do not help\r\none another. We have seen these active patterns in Asia,\r\nwhose economies were until recently described as\r\nmiraculous. Today, we are witnessing violent fluctuations\r\nthere. If globalization is a comprehensive concept, it ought\r\nto help us understand and solve crises. The approach of\r\nglobalization should include constant, permanent and stable\r\nguidelines, including ethics and sound initiatives and\r\ntransactions in the areas of financial markets, investment\r\nand monetary policy.\r\nThe questions of developing and least developed\r\ncountries remain unanswered because the responses entail\r\nobscure possibilities and visions. To simple people who are\r\nlooking for a way out of their indigence and poverty in\r\ncountries such as ours, talking about globalization appears\r\nto be an intellectual and theoretical luxury. Globalization\r\ncurrently does not present any tangible picture of equality.\r\nWhat is even more dangerous is that we are talking about\r\nglobalization as if it were a future, providential destiny and\r\na single option. Such logic hampers dialogue and may even\r\nblock all opportunities for free thinking. It makes it appear\r\nas if we were engaging in contracts of submission.\r\nThe least developed countries, including Yemen, need\r\nto undergo an immense rehabilitation process in order to\r\nlay the necessary developmental and economic groundwork\r\nwith a view to contributing to international integration and\r\nto playing a role in international partnership.\r\nGlobalization means new systems, radical reform\r\nprogrammes and new, effective and active government\r\ninstrumentalities. All this cannot be fulfilled with a magic\r\nwand. We need intensive efforts and broad cooperation.\r\nThe matter is not related solely to cooperation among\r\ncountries at the governmental level. It relates also to\r\nbroadening cooperation with private capital and the\r\nenhancement of work techniques.\r\nWhile the positive elements and prospects of\r\nglobalization offer opportunities for economic progress and\r\nprosperity, the narrowing of huge gaps is the main approach\r\nto making globalization not a marginal, but a true, system\r\nof partnership. Consequently, the question of narrowing the\r\nbasic economic, technical, communication and\r\nadministrative gaps emerges as a substantive and basic\r\nissue.\r\nIn this connection, what are the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the World Bank, the International Monetary\r\nFund and other affiliated institutions and agencies going\r\nto do? They have to transform themselves from\r\ninstitutions that hasten to manage crises into institutions\r\nthat try to prevent the emergence of such crises. They\r\nmust also work with the group of richest nations which\r\nare capable of formulating a development programme of\r\nrehabilitation for developing and least developed countries\r\nso that our world is not confronted with great disparities\r\nunder circumstances in which some of us are caught\r\nunawares, and even without other options which are less\r\ntaxing to us. Our countries have to understand precisely\r\nthe road they are travelling, the terms under which they\r\nare participating in the process and the price they have to\r\npay, and to what extent.\r\nIn conclusion, some of us have posed questions on\r\nthis occasion, while others have tried to answer some of\r\nthem. That, in reality, is the value and benefit of such\r\nexcellent exchanges.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Nigeria.\r\nMr. Osio (Nigeria): On account of unforeseen\r\ncircumstances, and considering that copies of our\r\nstatement have been duly filed with the Secretariat since\r\nyesterday morning, when we were to have spoken, my\r\nAmbassador, the Permanent Representative of Nigeria,\r\nhas sent me to deliver the statement of the Nigerian\r\ndelegation on behalf of our Foreign Minister, who is\r\nunable to be here due to other pressing national\r\nassignments.\r\nThe Foreign Minister has asked me to congratulate\r\nthe President on his recent election to lead this session of\r\nthe General Assembly and to assure him that he eagerly\r\nlooks forward to participating in all the business of the\r\ndays ahead. We also want to thank him for the\r\nopportunity to participate in this high-level dialogue,\r\nwhose complex theme is very relevant to us in the\r\ndeveloping world. Meetings of this nature advance our\r\nknowledge of the issues and the stakes.\r\nAt the outset, my delegation fully associates itself\r\nwith the statement made yesterday by the Foreign\r\nMinister of Indonesia on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nIn our large world, which technology is turning into an\r\never shrinking global village, it has become clear that no\r\none nation can afford to be an island unto itself, as very\r\nfew nations, if any, can boast of having all their socio-\r\neconomic and scientific needs provided solely from their\r\nown natural endowments within their national frontiers.\r\nInterdependence among nations big and small has therefore\r\nbecome as inevitable as the need to free their economies in\r\na global market, in the hope that needed goods and services\r\ncan be exchanged among nations on an equitable,\r\ntransparently predictable basis. In this light, globalization\r\nbecomes, as it should be, a people-oriented means — not\r\nan end in itself — of satisfying the needs of interdependent\r\npeoples, or one global family.\r\nMy delegation believes in the utilitarian value of\r\nglobalization. But however new the concept is, has\r\nglobalization always been beneficial to the people it is\r\nmeant to serve? No. In what ways have its effects been\r\nadverse? Several. For lack of time, we will proffer only a\r\nfew reasons for this situation, which policy makers need to\r\nlook into.\r\nFor instance, to a large extent, the current global\r\nfinancial turmoil — which has severely affected the hitherto\r\ntiger-strong economies of South-East Asia — could be\r\ntraced to the efforts of the countries of that region to\r\nembrace the concept of globalization and the liberalization\r\nof their economies to absorb foreign direct investment\r\nflows. The volatility of the currency markets which ensued\r\nfinally left in its wake telling adverse social and economic\r\neffects on the people of those countries, with potential\r\ncontagious effects for other economies of the world.\r\nOn the other hand, the comparatively poorer\r\neconomies of some other nations which, against great odds,\r\nexerted lesser liberalizing efforts to join the mainstream of\r\nthe global economy, cannot be glossed over. Since the early\r\n1980s net inflows into the 40 nations, mostly in Africa,\r\nwhich are classified as highly indebted poor countries have\r\naveraged 1.5 per cent of national income per year. This\r\nfactor increased their external debt from $55 billion in 1980\r\nto $206 billion in 1996. For this set of countries the current\r\nglobal financial turmoil rooted in efforts at globalization\r\nwill compound an already bad situation, given other factors.\r\nAmong those factors is the ever-falling price of\r\ncommodities, for which reason the global market cannot\r\nprovide the poor developing countries with any respite from\r\ntheir excruciating foreign debt burden. Such nations will\r\ntherefore continue to suffer weak growth and poor export\r\nperformance. The ultimate result is that, unless a deliberate\r\npolicy is implemented to cancel their debts, any effort on\r\nthe part of those poor countries to get on the globalization\r\ntrain will be fatally crippled and their citizens caught in\r\na quagmire of further social and economic deprivation.\r\nIt is a valid point that while globalization can have\r\ngood and bad social and economic impacts and benefits,\r\nthere are also socio-economic factors which can stunt the\r\nefforts of willing nations at integrating into the global\r\neconomy. Both hold good food for thought on the design\r\nand delivery of the appropriate policy options.\r\nIn fact, in an intricately interdependent world such\r\nas the one we live in, no nation should be marginalized\r\nfrom globalization and its benefits. In this same spirit, all\r\nnations should assist one another to remove all the\r\nobstacles, tariff and non-tariff, that bar their way to\r\nintegrating into the world economy. In both the\r\nderegulating and liberalizing processes, eventual\r\nglobalization should have a human face and aim at\r\nmaximizing the economic and social benefits to the\r\nnations and citizens involved.\r\nIndeed, it should give no one cause for joy or\r\ncomfort, in any quarters, to see that in a world affected\r\nby the process of globalization, more than a billion people\r\nlive in poverty, in absolute terms, and have been\r\nmarginalized within the same international civil society\r\nand thereby denied the opportunity and economic right to\r\nparticipate in a productive economic life.\r\nOn a brighter note, we have seen, and are indeed\r\nencouraged by, the open concern and spirit of solidarity\r\nbeing displayed by some developed countries with respect\r\nto the financial turmoil which has engulfed or threatens to\r\nengulf their counterpart developed countries. We\r\nappreciate the frantic efforts being contemplated to avoid\r\nits contagion, and we welcome the extension to the\r\ndeveloping countries of this spirit of making globalization\r\ntrouble-free. Under the one-family umbrella of the United\r\nNations and with the help of the multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions, we should see to it that just like the ignorance\r\nand adverse consequences that accompanied the efforts of\r\neach nation before integration, the benefits and joy\r\nconsequent upon globalization should be made to go\r\nround our interdependent world.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to the Permanent Representative of El Salvador.\r\nMr. Castaneda-Cornejo (El Salvador)\r\n(interpretation from Spanish): El Salvador is pleased to\r\ntake part in this high-level dialogue of the General\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nAssembly on the theme of the social and economic impact\r\nof globalization and interdependence and their policy\r\nimplications, and we fully support the ideas put forward by\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Mr. Ali\r\nAlatas, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe issue under consideration is relevant indeed, as we\r\nbelieve that a candid exchange of views and experiences\r\ncan contribute to our thinking and allow us jointly to\r\nanalyse and seek mechanisms to overcome the negative\r\nimpact of this important and inevitable phenomenon, which\r\nhas affected the developing countries in particular.\r\nGlobalization and the liberalization of markets has\r\nprovided great opportunities and major challenges for the\r\ninternational community. The advantages of globalization\r\nare known to all. Major progress has been made in poverty\r\nreduction, and international trade and private capital flows\r\nhave reached unprecedented levels. The major advances in\r\nthe areas of technology and information have practically\r\neliminated the barriers of time and distance.\r\nHowever, as is well known, not all countries are\r\nbenefiting equally from globalization. Countries with small\r\neconomies, as well as the more vulnerable sectors of\r\nsociety, are still marginalized by globalization. We are\r\nconcerned to see that the gap between countries as well as\r\nwithin the countries themselves continues to widen.\r\nThe international community must jointly work in a\r\nspirit of cooperation in seeking solutions to reverse this\r\ntrend, and it must devise measures to ensure that the\r\nopportunities and advantages provided by globalization may\r\nbe shared by all countries and all national sectors of those\r\ncountries in a more equitable and fairer fashion.\r\nThe dangers of growing interdependence have been\r\nmade clear in the analysis that was made of the recent\r\neconomic and financial crises that have affected various\r\nregions of the world and particularly the most vulnerable\r\nsectors of society. The contagion effect is such that\r\nfinancial crises in one region have a negative impact on\r\ndifferent parts of the world and reach different sectors of\r\nthe international community, making it clear that this could\r\nbring about the threat of a worldwide recession. More then\r\never before it is imperative to join and redouble efforts in\r\norder to establish mechanisms aimed at reducing the\r\ndangers of this interdependence and avoid that which some\r\nrightly label “the globalization of economic and financial\r\ncrises”.\r\nIt is also important to establish national, regional and\r\neven multilateral mechanisms in order to monitor and\r\nwatch closely capital flows, particularly short-term ones,\r\nin order to avoid the drastic capital flows that can lead to\r\ndestabilization and financial crises. We believe also that\r\nit is of the utmost importance to establish social safety\r\nnets in order to protect and safeguard the most vulnerable\r\nsegments of society.\r\nWe cannot speak of globalization without touching\r\nupon the issue of cooperation for development. We all are\r\naware that in this era of globalization and liberalization of\r\nmarkets, the role of international trade and private\r\ninvestments is becoming increasingly important in\r\ndeveloping countries to foster economic growth and\r\nsustainable development. It is true that private capital\r\nflows from developed to developing countries have been\r\nincreasing, often rapidly. But it is also true that such\r\nflows are not distributed equitably among all countries.\r\nCountries with smaller economies, such as mine, are often\r\nexcluded from the benefits of private investments.\r\nWe note with great concern that in recent years\r\nofficial development assistance has been consistently\r\ndecreasing. For many countries, including mine, official\r\ndevelopment assistance continues to be an important\r\nresource for us to carry out programmes aimed at\r\nachieving sustainable human development, which depend\r\nlargely on international cooperation programmes.\r\nIt is important to recognize that most social projects,\r\nsuch as education, health care and basic infrastructure, do\r\nnot succeed in attracting private capital, because often\r\nthese sectors present few opportunities for profit for\r\nnational or foreign investors. Official development\r\nassistance will continue to be an important\r\ncomplementary effort, and one that is in some cases\r\nindispensable to guarantee the sustainable development of\r\ndeveloping countries. Thus, we deem it very important to\r\nstrengthen mechanisms of international cooperation and\r\nfinancing for development.\r\nEl Salvador recognizes the importance of our\r\ncountry’s integration into the world economy, and\r\ncountless efforts are being made towards this objective.\r\nSince 1989, El Salvador has been implementing a system\r\nof social market economy and has already achieved a\r\nstable macroeconomic situation with sustained growth.\r\nWe have also been carrying out a policy of\r\ncomprehensive liberalization of our economy, with major\r\ntariff reductions and the elimination of non-tariff barriers,\r\nconsistent with the World Trade Organization’s\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nregulations. There are programmes of State modernization,\r\nwithin which important measures and decisions have been\r\ntaken, such as those to privatize the telecommunications\r\nand energy sectors, with part of the funds from the sale of\r\nState enterprises being used to implement a set of major\r\nsocial investment programmes. We are also implementing\r\na national competitiveness programme wherein the training\r\nof human resources, the promotion of exports, in particular\r\nof non-traditional exports, the attraction of investments and\r\nthe modernization of our infrastructure are of fundamental\r\nimportance.\r\nOne of the objectives of El Salvador’s economic\r\nopenness is the promotion of national and foreign\r\ninvestments in the country, focusing on efforts to diversify\r\nthe productive sector and designed to promote the\r\ndevelopment of technological capabilities so that it can\r\nmeet the challenges of globalization. Openness has led to\r\nfavourable results that have placed El Salvador in a stable\r\neconomic position, which has been recognized by\r\ninstitutions of international prestige.\r\nNevertheless, El Salvador has difficulty in attracting\r\ndirect investment capital because of increasing competition.\r\nAs many other speakers have stated, only a small number\r\nof developing countries attract the great majority of private\r\ncapital flows, and the weaker countries are marginalized\r\ndespite their major efforts to organize and adjust their\r\nmacroeconomic policies so as to become part of the world\r\neconomy.\r\nFinally, I would like to place special emphasis on the\r\nneed for the United Nations to continue making efforts to\r\npromote dialogue on international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. We, the developing countries, are working to\r\nbecome part of the world economy. But we need to have a\r\nclimate of security which will guarantee access for our\r\nproducts to world markets without conditions and disguised\r\nprotectionism. We need the right climate to promote the\r\ntransfer of technology in full agreement with the rules on\r\nthe protection of intellectual property but with favourable\r\nconditions for the developing countries. And we need an\r\nenvironment which will facilitate transfers of private\r\ncapital, especially for countries, such as El Salvador, which\r\nhave small economies but which have made positive strides\r\nto achieve a stable economy in a context of consolidating\r\ndemocracy and promoting human rights.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nRapporteur of the first ministerial round table on national\r\nresponses to globalization, Mr. Percy Metsing Mangoaela\r\nof Lesotho.\r\nMr. Mangoaela (Lesotho): Allow me to present to\r\nthis plenary meeting of the General Assembly a summary\r\nof one of the two ministerial round tables on social and\r\neconomic impact of globalization, the one on national\r\nresponses that was held this morning.\r\nThe ministerial round table opened with a statement\r\nby the Chairman, Minister of State Helmut Schäfer of\r\nGermany. The discussions revolved around the challenges\r\nand opportunities arising from globalization, the need for\r\na level playing field for developed and developing\r\ncountries to ensure an equitable sharing of the benefits of\r\nglobalization and the need for national policies on the part\r\nof developing countries and their partners with a view to\r\nfacilitating integration of developing countries into the\r\nglobal economic processes, as well as to protect the\r\nsegments of the population that are adversely affected by\r\nglobalization. The round table addressed a number of\r\nsalient issues, including the following:\r\nFirst, globalization was seen as an inevitable process.\r\nThis is now a universally shared perception. It is also\r\nwidely believed that it has the potential for providing\r\nsubstantial opportunities to all countries. There is hardly\r\nany scope for countries to opt out of this process; a\r\ncountry stands to lose much by deciding not to opt in.\r\nOne should not overreact to pressures and costs that\r\nglobalization can impose on countries or segments of the\r\npopulation. While such difficulties, and the perception of\r\nGovernments’ powerlessness in coping with forces\r\ncausing instability, can engender deep uncertainty and\r\nfrustration, that should not lead one to believe that\r\nglobalization is an evil force that can and should be\r\nabandoned.\r\nSecondly, there was the need for a level playing\r\nfield. Although tremendous gains had been made from\r\nglobalization, such benefits remained unevenly distributed\r\namong and within countries. Industrialized countries had\r\nmade substantial gains from the process. For an\r\noverwhelming majority in the developing countries, the\r\nconsequences of globalization had been traumatic. Most\r\ndeveloping countries did not have the institutional\r\nendowments to effectively integrate into the world\r\neconomy. Even within industrialized countries, certain\r\nsegments of the population had been excluded from the\r\nbenefits of globalization. For countries bypassed by the\r\nglobalization process, costs of the process appeared to be\r\nmuch higher than the benefits accrued. In many\r\ndeveloping countries, social consequences included\r\nworsening poverty and declines in employment, education\r\nand health status. The asymmetric distribution of benefits\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nand risks arising from globalization warranted a new\r\ncontract between developing and developed countries based\r\non genuine solidarity and shared responsibility, with a view\r\nto creating a level playing field for all countries to take full\r\nadvantage of the process. A central aspect of this contract\r\nshould be a common vision of universal growth and\r\ndevelopment that benefits all Countries and all individuals.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThirdly, there was a need for national policy\r\nresponses. Managing globalization was viewed as a\r\nfundamental issue. Countries needed to fashion an optimal\r\nresponse by designing and sequencing their integration into\r\nthe world economy in a manner commensurate with their\r\nparticular circumstances. Policy approaches to this should\r\ncontain a proper balance of emphasis between maximizing\r\nopportunities and minimizing risks. A properly sequenced\r\napproach was advocated as opposed to big-bang\r\nliberalization.\r\nDeveloping countries should bear the primary\r\nresponsibility for their development policies and measures.\r\nThey should pursue sound macroeconomic policies, strive\r\nto increase domestic savings and investment, strengthen\r\ninstitutional, legal, regulatory and supervisory capacities and\r\nimprove economic management in the public and private\r\nsectors. They should ensure transparency and accountability\r\nin the decision-making process and avoid corruption.\r\nIn coping with crises arising from globalization, new\r\nregulations to anticipate such crises were needed. Reduction\r\nof private-sector debt commanded particular urgency. Once\r\na country slumped into deep difficulties, it might need to\r\nhave recourse to a temporary standstill with regard to\r\noutflow of capital, as suggested in the Trade and\r\nDevelopment Report 1998.\r\nWhile some sections of the population might be\r\nexcluded from the benefits of globalization, or even be\r\nharmed by the process, it would be important to build\r\ninternational strategies — such measures as might\r\nameliorate the negative consequences of globalization.\r\nThere was a need to put in place social safety nets to shield\r\nvulnerable segments of the population from the possible\r\ndeleterious consequences of globalization.\r\nAnd finally, although the topic for the morning was\r\nnational responses, there were so many intersections\r\nbetween national and global responses that there were a few\r\ndiversions into international responses. The morning session\r\ntalked about increasing official development assistance to\r\nsupport the development of certain sectors such as\r\neducation, health and infrastructure, as well as debt\r\nreduction, support for setting up social safety nets, fairer\r\ntrading arrangements and facilitating private capital flows.\r\nAs can be seen from the summary I have just given,\r\nthe exchange was comprehensive and deep and was\r\nundertaken with all seriousness. The outcome truly\r\njustifies the time spent on the examination of the issues\r\nraised by globalization and liberalization — only as a\r\nstarting point for a focused and long-term addressing of\r\nthese phenomena.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank\r\nthe Rapporteur of the first ministerial round table, and I\r\nnow give the floor to the Rapporteur of the second\r\nministerial round table on international responses to\r\nglobalization, His Excellency Mr. Jā nis Priedkalns of\r\nLatvia.\r\nMr. Priedkalns (Latvia): In reporting on the\r\nministerial round table on international responses to the\r\nsocial and economic impact of globalization, I\r\nacknowledge the excellent contributions of the Chairman\r\nof the round table, of the national representatives and the\r\nrepresentatives of the United Nations agencies, the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Labour Organization and the United Nations\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs.\r\nIn the view of the speakers, globalization represents\r\nthe dynamics of the world economy at the end of this\r\ncentury. The processes that have facilitated the\r\ntechnological innovations of the recent past have guided\r\nthe process of globalization. Capital today has an\r\nunparalleled degree of mobility. The volume of world\r\ntrade and foreign direct investment is increasing more\r\nrapidly than the gross domestic product, and a growing\r\nproportion of the investment takes places in transnational\r\ncompanies.\r\nAt the same time, globalization, in the view of the\r\nrepresentatives, entails risks for societies and economies.\r\nWhile the international responses to the social and\r\neconomic impact of globalization are generally assessed\r\npositively, the national responses are varied. It is stressed\r\nby many societies, particularly the smaller and\r\ntechnologically less developed ones, that social structures\r\nshould develop in parallel to the new economic\r\nenvironment. It is emphasized that marginalization may\r\nconstitute a serious problem for those countries most in\r\nneed of increased trade, investment and growth, as well\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nas of stronger financial structures to absorb the stresses of\r\nsudden shifts in market orientation. This raises the prospect\r\nof a widening gulf between countries that are able to\r\nbenefit from globalization and those that find it difficult to\r\nprofit from a liberalized, deregulated system.\r\nIt is also feared that globalization endangers social\r\nstructures and undermines cultural diversity, as well as\r\nnational and regional identities. These challenges transcend\r\nthe economic sphere and point to the need for culture-based\r\ninstruments to address effectively the issues of\r\ninclusiveness and the participation of all peoples.\r\nRecent events have shown that the current global\r\nfinancial crisis is not an Asian crisis; it is much more\r\npervasive. No one is quite safe. An adequate international\r\nresponse has become necessary. Indeed, much improved\r\nglobal governance is required to match the challenge.\r\nThe development of national systems — financial,\r\ntaxation, accountability — must be accompanied by global\r\nregulation, particularly in reference to foreign-exchange\r\nturnover, which we know is significantly greater than the\r\nreal economies themselves yet affects exchange rates. The\r\n1990s have shown this problem to be partly explained by\r\nthe money-transfer system. Secondly, the trade account\r\ninstruments only partly shape a country’s position. Rather,\r\nit is capital, assets and investments that are responsible for\r\nthe trade account situation.\r\nContrary to the past, problems today have emerged not\r\nbecause of current account imbalances, but because of\r\nsudden, disruptive changes in the capital account. The\r\namounts of resources involved are of such magnitude that\r\nthey have overwhelmed the available funds in the\r\ninternational financial institutions, despite very strong\r\nadditional bilateral support for many countries. Thus a plan\r\nfor an adequate level of funds to anticipate and to prevent\r\nfuture crises remains a major collective challenge.\r\nIn the short term, the key is to assess the capability of\r\nthe international monetary system to manage the crisis. Two\r\npossible avenues were presented by the speakers: redrawing\r\nthe global financial rules with marginal institutional\r\nchanges, or redesigning the global financial architecture.\r\nWhatever the avenue chosen, it is essential that we adapt\r\nthe international financial institutions to the requirements of\r\nthe next century.\r\nBesides designing financial rules of international\r\ngovernance, domestic policies are also important. Prudent\r\nregulations and good management at the national level are\r\nessential.\r\nGlobalization, in the view of most of the speakers,\r\nis irreversible. Yet exclusively market-driven globalization\r\nis acknowledged to be indifferent to fairness, indifferent\r\nto human and social progress. Major joint efforts by\r\nmembers of the international community are needed to\r\ndevise norms in order for globalization to become truly\r\nsupportive of human development. The United Nations\r\nitself is the most obvious candidate to assume normative\r\nleadership in this process.\r\nWe are faced with a major task. In the view of the\r\nspeakers, national and international responses are required\r\nto make globalization an overall positive development so\r\nthat the quality of life — both economic welfare and the\r\nenjoyment of cultural heritage — of all people may be\r\nimproved. Policies must be designed for fair world trade\r\nand a global civic society so that the benefits may be\r\nshared by all people.\r\nAs emphasized by the representative of the\r\nInternational Labour Organization, social and human\r\nprogress on the one hand and economic growth on the\r\nother must be linked. Human resources world wide must\r\nbe involved, with the United Nations agencies and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council playing a central role in\r\nshaping the vision of the future of the world. The\r\ncapacity for teamwork and the experience of the United\r\nNations form a solid basis on which to carry out this task.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I call\r\non the representative of Indonesia, who will make a\r\nstatement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nMr. Alatas (Indonesia): We have come to the\r\nconclusion of what has undeniably been a very productive\r\nand enlightening two-day dialogue on issues of vital\r\nimportance to the Group of 77 and China and to the\r\nworld at large. Over the past two days we have focused\r\nour deliberations on the social and economic impact of\r\nglobalization and interdependence and on their policy\r\nimplications.\r\nAt this point I shall not endeavour to present a\r\nsummary, much less outline the conclusions, of our\r\ndiscussions. The rapporteurs of the two round tables, one\r\non national responses and the other on international\r\nresponses to globalization, have provided us with\r\ninsightful reports on how the lively and stimulating debate\r\nproceeded. From the discussions a very encouraging\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nconvergence of perceptions emerged among all\r\nparticipants — representatives of Governments, of United\r\nNations agencies and of non-governmental organizations;\r\nrepresentatives of developed and developing countries — as\r\nto one particular current aspect of globalization, namely the\r\nrecent financial and economic crisis, which started in one\r\npart of the world, East Asia, but which in its scope has now\r\nundeniably become a global crisis and which in its nature\r\nhas evolved from a monetary and financial crisis to a full-\r\nblown economic and social crisis.\r\nIt is also quite clear that, in facing globalization with\r\nits vast opportunities as well as its dire challenges, the\r\ninternational community is called upon to take urgent\r\nsteps — globally, regionally and nationally — to manage\r\nthis force of globalization with a view to maximizing its\r\nbenefits and minimizing its risks.\r\nAt this stage, I would like to express, on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, our deep appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General and his able collaborators for making it\r\npossible to convene these important meetings, and to our\r\npartners in the developed world for responding so positively\r\nto our call for a renewal of the dialogue.\r\nAs may be recalled, the Group of 77 and the non-\r\naligned countries called for this renewal of the dialogue\r\nsome four years ago in the hope that this dialogue would\r\nnot only strengthen economic cooperation among all\r\ncountries, developed and developing alike, but would do so\r\non a new basis, a basis that had not hitherto been applied\r\nor adopted in similar circumstances. That new basis, as has\r\nbeen elucidated on several occasions, is one that derives its\r\nimportance from a sense of common benefit, of mutual\r\ninterest and of genuine interdependence. These together, in\r\nthe hope of the developing countries, will result in a new\r\nkind of equitable global partnership.\r\nWe hope that this first, very encouraging step of a\r\nrenewed dialogue will not stop here as a one-shot affair.\r\nWe hope that from this dialogue will grow a habit, an\r\nagreed way of continuing, and a further developed dialogue\r\non issues of vital common interest to both the developed\r\nand the developing countries. We hope that the new\r\napproach to this dialogue — as I said, based on a\r\ncommonality of interests and of benefits rather than on a\r\nconfrontational agenda or on the adversarial approaches of\r\nthe past — will lead us to the resolution of problems that\r\nrequire our urgent attention and urgent common action. We\r\nbelieve that the current economic and financial problems of\r\nthe world require global solutions that can only be achieved\r\nthrough such a partnership, and that globalization makes it\r\neven more imperative that we work together to face the\r\nchallenges of the coming millennium, which is already\r\nknocking at our door.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to Mr. Lennkh, representative of Austria and\r\nDirector-General of the Department for Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment of the European Union, who will speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union.\r\nMr. Lennkh (Austria): Speaking on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union, I should first like to express our\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General and to Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral Mr. Desai and his team for organizing this\r\nmeeting, which, given the current economic turmoil and\r\nuncertainties, has indeed been very timely.\r\nWe also welcome the interactive format of this\r\nmeeting, in particular the inter-ministerial round tables, as\r\nwell as the expert panels.\r\nFor us, too, now is the time not to give a complete\r\nsumming up of this very rich and lively debate, but only\r\nto make a few points and highlights of what we have\r\nretained from this discussion. We thought it was a very\r\nconstructive discussion on the opportunities, challenges\r\nand risks of globalization. There was a broad consensus\r\nthat free trade and free capital movements have brought\r\nabout gains and opportunities to developed as well as\r\ndeveloping countries. It was also felt, however, that not\r\nall countries benefit equally from these gains and that it\r\nis in particular the least developed countries that are\r\nfacing severe problems of marginalization.\r\nThere are adverse effects of globalization, such as\r\nthe volatility of short-term capital flows, which carry\r\nserious risks, in particular for many of the emerging\r\nmarket economies. From the various interventions which\r\naddressed national experiences, there emerged a fairly\r\nwide consensus on the importance of appropriate policy\r\nresponses to these challenges at the national level. There\r\nseems to be a growing convergence on what sound\r\npolicies are. Besides strong macroeconomic fundamentals,\r\na sound institutional and regulatory framework is critical\r\nfor effectively managing the consequences of\r\nglobalization.\r\nBut it was also pointed out, very importantly, that\r\nthe social dimension must be an integral part of these\r\npolicy responses, including a better distribution of the\r\nbenefits of growth. The need to support, in particular, the\r\npoor developing countries in improving their institutional\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nand management capacities to cope with the challenges of\r\nglobalization was widely felt. There is also a continued\r\nneed for substantial official development assistance flows,\r\nboth for the institutional tasks and for the purely\r\nhumanitarian response that is necessary in many cases.\r\nThere was a strong call to refrain from protectionism\r\nand isolationism. There was a broad consensus that there is\r\na need for strengthening the multilateral system for coping\r\nwith the urgent tasks which are before us. But common\r\nresponses have to be built on shared values that reflect the\r\nbroader aspirations of our global societies. The United\r\nNations, with its broad mandate and its legitimacy, is a\r\nunique forum for defining the principles and norms\r\nnecessary to harness the potential of globalization.\r\nLet me conclude that, in the end, many questions arose\r\nfrom this meeting. We do not yet have the answers and it\r\nis now time to give thought to common responses. We\r\ntherefore gladly take up the call of the representative of\r\nIndonesia, speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, to work at these responses in a true spirit of\r\npartnership.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to Mr. Michael Southwick, Deputy Assistant\r\nSecretary of State for International Organizations of the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nMr. Southwick (United States of America): I want to\r\nexpress the appreciation of the United States Government\r\nfor the opportunity during this dialogue to advance our\r\nmutual understanding of the opportunities and risks\r\nassociated with the process of globalization, a process that\r\nhas surprised all of us by the speed with which it has\r\ntransformed our lives. Indeed, this dialogue, as stated by\r\nour Colombian colleague just a few minutes ago, has been\r\nconducted under a new spirit of partnership rather than\r\nconfrontation.\r\nIn his speech to the New York Council on Foreign\r\nRelations on 14 September, President Clinton clearly\r\narticulated our common stake in the continued expansion of\r\na stable and open world economic order that can serve the\r\nneeds of ordinary people around the globe. He has pledged\r\nthat the United States will work with our international\r\npartners to mitigate the impact of the current financial crisis\r\nand to intensify our efforts to reform our trade and financial\r\ninstitutions so that they can respond better to the challenges\r\nwe now face and those we are likely to face in the future.\r\nHe has expressed what all of us here feel — that it is\r\nunacceptable that economic turmoil should plunge millions\r\ninto sudden poverty and misery. The United States will\r\nnot stand by and watch this happen.\r\nThis has been an exceptionally frank and\r\nconstructive dialogue. Speaking for the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, Indonesian Foreign Minister Mr. Ali Alatas, in his\r\nopening remarks, considerably advanced our discussion.\r\nHe reminded us that we share a common commitment,\r\ndeveloped over decades, to combat poverty and that we\r\nhave a legacy of cooperation and institutions which we\r\nhave laboured to construct for that struggle. We can also\r\nall take heart in his faith that even the most severely\r\naffected economies are capable of an early recovery,\r\ngiven an environment that is conducive to rigorous\r\nreform, access to development finance and export\r\nmarkets, and participation in technological progress. In\r\nshort, the answer lies not in resisting globalization — that\r\nis neither possible nor desirable — but in making it work\r\nbetter.\r\nThe United States is well aware of the pain of\r\nadjusting domestically to globalization. We can well\r\nunderstand the impact of the current financial crisis on the\r\npoorest, the potential threat to new democracies and the\r\ntemptation to seek short-term relief by returning to failed\r\npolicies of the past. We therefore express our admiration\r\nfor Governments that are determined to stay the course\r\ntowards our common vision of a stable world comprised\r\nof open, prosperous, democratic societies.\r\nThe exchange here over the past two days has\r\nopened many windows on the social and economic impact\r\nof globalization. It is clear that we must move beyond the\r\nstatus quo. The challenges are quite formidable.\r\nNevertheless, while the impact of the financial crisis is\r\nalready broad, we must distinguish among the issues\r\nconfronting those countries which have aggressively\r\nembraced the globalization process by liberalizing their\r\neconomies and those which have not. Similarly, while the\r\ncurrent economic crisis has already had severe social\r\nconsequences in many countries, we should recognize that\r\nthose countries which have already effectively addressed\r\nthe structural causes of poverty by investment in human\r\ncapital, expanded democracy and sound employment-\r\nenhancing policies face a very different problem from\r\nthose which have not. Finally, the fact that nearly every\r\nspeaker here agrees that institutional weaknesses,\r\ninternational and domestic, are the core of the problem\r\nshould contribute to shaping a positive and comprehensive\r\napproach to globalization. Balancing reform and relief,\r\ncountry by country, will need careful attention.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nPresident Clinton has already proposed a six-point\r\nresponse to the financial crisis. The discussions here will\r\nprovide valuable input into that process. The United States\r\nAgency for International Development is already adjusting\r\nits assistance programmes to take into account the human\r\nconsequences of the crisis by providing support to social\r\nsafety nets and financial institutional reform. As stated\r\nearlier, the United States will work with the international\r\ninstitutions to find solutions. The Clinton Administration\r\nfully understands the importance of strong international\r\nleadership on these issues. We will contribute our part.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Mr. President, Excellencies\r\nand friends, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no subject\r\nmore important than the one you have been discussing here\r\nfor the past two days. Nor could your meeting be more\r\ntimely. I am only sorry I was not able to be with you\r\nthroughout the discussions. As you know, the dates for this\r\nmeeting were fixed at short notice, and I had a long-\r\nstanding engagement elsewhere which I felt I must respect.\r\nBut I have been following your proceedings closely through\r\nmy staff. I congratulate you on getting down to the hard\r\nsubstance of your agenda, and I am glad you have done so\r\nthrough informal panels with outside experts. That is one\r\nmore example of fruitful interaction between States and\r\nnon-State actors, which I hope the world is coming to see\r\nas a hallmark of the United Nations.\r\nWhat started last year as an Asian crisis is now clearly\r\nbecoming global. No part of the world is unaffected, though\r\nof course not all regions are affected in the same way.\r\nIndeed, not the least dangerous aspect of this crisis is that\r\nit threatens to further widen the gap between the rich and\r\nthe poor, both within countries and at the global level. In a\r\nsense, this is the first major crisis of globalization. But I am\r\nglad you have not wasted your time discussing how far it\r\nshould be blamed on globalization. That might be\r\ninteresting for historians, but it would not be helpful for\r\npolicy makers like you. Globalization is a dominant feature\r\nof our times, and we have no prospect of reversing it, even\r\nif we wish to do so. What we do have to do is to devise\r\nways of managing it better. We have somehow to maximize\r\nthe benefits and to protect those who are in danger of\r\nbecoming victims.\r\nMy good friend Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister of\r\nIndonesia, put it exactly right when he told you that rather\r\nthan stifling globalization and further integration of the\r\ndeveloping countries, we should explore how globalization\r\ncan best serve all humankind and how its unpredictability\r\ncan be redressed.\r\nI know many developing countries are going through\r\nvery difficult times this year. The temptation to retreat\r\ninto nationalism or populism can be strong. But I am\r\nencouraged to see that in almost every developing country\r\nthose false solutions are being rejected. I noted this\r\nespecially at the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nin Durban, which I attended earlier this month. That\r\nsummit produced an eloquent Declaration for the New\r\nMillennium, which said, among other things, that\r\n“the creation of a multilateral rules-based system is\r\nfundamentally an advance, but to be successful it\r\nmust carry the endorsement of, and active\r\nparticipation by, developing countries”.\r\nIndeed, my friends, that must be the way forward. If\r\nsomething has been wrong up to now it is that developing\r\ncountries have often been far too passive rather than\r\nactive participants in the search for a collective response\r\nto globalization.\r\nIn many of the bodies where decisions affecting the\r\nworld economy are taken — from the Group of Seven\r\nthrough the World Trade Organization to our sister\r\nBretton Woods institutions in Washington — the strongest\r\nvoices are those of countries which have already achieved\r\neconomic success. None of those institutions is infallible,\r\nnor would they claim to be, but all have a great deal of\r\nwisdom to offer. One of my priorities since I became\r\nSecretary-General has been to forge closer working\r\nrelations with them.\r\nBut the United Nations does have a unique and\r\nindispensable role to play. Our broad mandate, our\r\nuniversal membership and our ability to involve non-State\r\nactors, all make the United Nations uniquely well\r\nequipped to help forge a global response to the crisis,\r\nwhich is global not only in the geographical sense, but\r\nalso in the range of issues that it raises. We have, I\r\nbelieve, a special responsibility to insist on the need for\r\nglobal solutions based on global rules that are fair to all.\r\nWe also have a responsibility to ensure that nations react\r\nnot by turning away from each other, but by coming\r\ntogether to find solutions based on the founding principles\r\nwhich we all have in common. And we have a\r\nresponsibility to insist that the interests of those hardest\r\nhit by the crisis are not forgotten.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nThis year, according to our latest estimates, the cost to\r\ndeveloping countries of the collapse in commodity prices is\r\nequivalent to roughly 8 per cent — and for Africa as much\r\nas 15 per cent — of the value of their 1997 exports. Those\r\nfigures imply terrible hardship for millions of individuals.\r\nSomething must be done to bring them relief. The most\r\nobvious measures are those mentioned to you by the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General yesterday: increased flows of\r\nofficial aid, carefully targeted to meet the real needs of the\r\npoor; and swift action to reduce the debt burden on the\r\npoorest countries, which the crisis has made even more\r\nunsustainable. The industrialized world, so far, has been\r\nrelatively little affected. But, as its leaders are beginning to\r\nrecognize, that state of affairs cannot continue indefinitely.\r\nA week ago Wim Duisenberg, the president of the\r\nnew European Central Bank, warned that the international\r\nfinancial turmoil will have a dampening effect on world\r\ngrowth. And on Monday President Clinton said that the\r\nfuture prosperity of the United States\r\n“depends on whether we can work with others to\r\nrestore confidence, manage change, stabilize the\r\nfinancial system and spur robust global growth”.\r\nI very much welcome that statement, and the six-point\r\nprogramme which the President announced seems to me to\r\nbe an important starting point. Certainly the crisis cannot be\r\nsolved unless the industrialized nations shoulder their\r\nresponsibilities and resolve to work with others to find\r\nsolutions which take the interests of all countries into\r\naccount.\r\nIf they do that, even this agonizing crisis may have\r\nsome positive side-effects. It may be an opportunity for the\r\nworld at last to approach global problems in a truly global\r\nspirit.\r\nThe United Nations stands ready to play its part, and\r\nthe Assembly’s work over the last two days shows that we\r\nhave an important contribution to make.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his statement.\r\nOver the last few days we have participated in this\r\nmeeting and have witnessed the success of a true innovation\r\nin the work of the Assembly. During this high-level\r\nmeeting, we have seen a creative combination of various\r\nmodalities of action: a plenary debate in which delegations\r\nexpressed their national positions; two ministerial round\r\ntables devoted to the consideration of national responses;\r\nand international responses to globalization. This allowed\r\nfor a productive and stimulating exchange of views on\r\nfundamental aspects of the experience acquired and of the\r\npolicies adopted at the national and international levels.\r\nTwo informal group meetings also took place, yielding a\r\ngreat deal of specialized information: knowledge and\r\nperspectives from the private sector, academia, unions and\r\ncivil society as a whole.\r\nWe have considered from various angles the broad\r\nand complex question of globalization, its economic and\r\nsocial consequences, and possible responses from a\r\npolitical standpoint. Our dialogue has been very\r\nconstructive. The debates and deliberations have been rich\r\nin content and replete with ideas and proposals that will\r\nlay the groundwork for finding solutions. The statement\r\njust made by the Secretary-General and the statement by\r\nthe Deputy Secretary-General, made at the beginning of\r\nour endeavours, laid out the guidelines and directions that\r\nare emerging, or seem to be emerging, from these\r\ndialogue meetings.\r\nI could not possibly do justice to the wide range and\r\ndiversity of views and opinions and the wealth of ideas\r\nand suggestions submitted here if I tried to summarize\r\nthem in their entirety. Therefore under my leadership and\r\nin consultation with delegations, a detailed summary will\r\nbe issued and circulated at a later stage. For the time\r\nbeing, however, I should like simply to make a few\r\nobservations and underscore some main issues.\r\nThese high-level meetings have shown the usefulness\r\nand the value of holding a dialogue in these\r\ncircumstances, with ministerial participation, on the\r\nquestion of globalization. This is an extremely important\r\nissue, as it has an impact on humankind as a whole. For\r\nthat reason, the need for this dialogue has been widely\r\nacknowledged.\r\nDialogue itself constitutes interaction aimed at\r\nbroadening understanding and helping to find solutions. In\r\nthis connection, I believe that it would not be overstating\r\nthe case to say that the first step has been taken here in\r\npromoting better understanding and establishing and\r\nidentifying the areas where new measures are needed. The\r\nvalue of this opportunity, the relevance of this dialogue\r\nand the key role played by the United Nations in\r\npromoting this dialogue have been recognized by all.\r\nEverything seems to indicate that globalization is\r\ninevitable, that it is a fact of life and not an option. There\r\nis no choice to be made. It is a positive force of global\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nproportions, not a negative one, but in some circumstances\r\nit can act blindly. To avoid that possibility it must be very\r\ncarefully channelled at the national and international levels.\r\nInternationalization or globalization — words that are\r\noften used interchangeably — allows resources to circulate\r\nthroughout the world, promoting growth and thus social\r\nwell-being.\r\nIn order to achieve better integration in the world\r\neconomy, countries must have solid macroeconomic\r\npolicies; they must devise effective legal and political\r\nframeworks; their physical, material and human\r\ninfrastructures must be up to the task; and they must\r\ncarefully manage their economies. Developing countries, for\r\ntheir part, have the primary responsibility of satisfying\r\nthose requirements, but international support and\r\ninternational cooperation continues to be of the essence in\r\norder for such efforts to be successful.\r\nWhile it is true that extraordinary achievements have\r\nalready been registered as a result of the globalization\r\nprocess and of development efforts, the changes inherent in\r\nthat process and technological advances have led to\r\nincreased uncertainty and risks. That fact has been\r\nacknowledged here.\r\nDisparities in income levels have continued to\r\nincrease, seriously impeding attempts by the developing\r\ncountries to incorporate high technology into their\r\neconomies and thus enhance their competitiveness.\r\nThere is a danger of a deflationary spiral at the global\r\nlevel, because the current prevailing worldwide crisis could\r\ncertainly lead to a worldwide recession. We must therefore\r\ntake emergency steps — rapid and decisive measures — in\r\norder to avert this danger.\r\nGovernments should not react by isolating themselves\r\nor moving towards autarchy but rather should keep their\r\neconomies open. They must focus on their capacity to\r\nstrengthen their institutions and infrastructures; stimulate the\r\nworld economy; stabilizing the financial markets; increase\r\nthe flows of official development assistance; alleviate the\r\ndebt burden of the poorest countries and the private sector;\r\nimprove market access by doing away with whatever\r\nobstacles exist; and enhance support for social safety nets.\r\nFor their part, national authorities have the\r\nresponsibility to redress the failings of the marketplace, but\r\nthe success of measures to overcome the crisis will depend\r\non joint agreements and joint work carried out both by\r\nnational authorities and by the multilateral institutions that\r\nwere basically created for that purpose. There must\r\ntherefore be a more thorough dialogue based on mutual\r\nunderstanding and on an appropriate allocation of\r\nresponsibilities. In our view, the key point is that the\r\ncurrent architecture of the world financial system has\r\nbeen shown to lack the preventive and persuasive powers\r\nnecessary to avoid crises, and we must therefore redesign\r\nthe system. The redesign could come from within the\r\nexisting system, or both from within and from outside.\r\nThe fundamental elements of the system must be\r\ntransparency, responsibility and participation at all\r\nlevels — national, regional and international. Each\r\ncountry must determine the pace and sequence of its work\r\nof liberalizing capital flows, freely taking into account its\r\nown specific needs. The United Nations and the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions will have to continue to work together\r\nin support of national efforts.\r\nIn that connection, United Nations cooperation with\r\nthe World Trade Organization must be strengthened in\r\norder to promote international trade and thus avoid\r\nprotectionist policies and practices. In other words, we\r\nneed a trading system that is transparent and based on\r\nclearly defined norms, providing an equitable framework\r\nwithin which the benefits of globalization can be shared.\r\nAfrica and the least developed countries, which are\r\nthreatened by marginalization, need free access to\r\nmarkets. Although it is true that private capital flows have\r\ngreatly increased, these cannot be a substitute for official\r\ndevelopment assistance; levels of official development\r\nassistance must be increased. More vigorous efforts are\r\nrequired to ease the debt problem; one stabilizing factor\r\ncould be increased long-term borrowing on favourable\r\nterms. Balance-of-payments surpluses could be recycled\r\nthrough loans and through offered without conditionality\r\nand involving the modalities of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe marginalization of countries and groups of\r\npeople within countries has been given considerable\r\nattention, as has the problem of the lack of symmetry and\r\neven the inequality to which globalization has given rise.\r\nMuch concern has been expressed about the devastating\r\nsocial consequences of the current financial crisis,\r\nparticularly massive unemployment, the loss of health and\r\neducational services, and the consequent increase in\r\npoverty in affected countries. In developing countries that\r\nare in danger of being marginalized in the process of\r\nglobalization, the costs could be greater than the benefits.\r\nTherefore, urgent concerted action is required to give\r\nthem greater assistance and increased trading\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 6th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 18 September 1998\r\nopportunities so that they can truly take advantage of the\r\nbenefits of globalization. Trade and financial channels\r\nshould work together in these efforts.\r\nIt was felt that the principal problem that the\r\nauthorities must overcome is to determine how to make\r\nsure that political measures intended to solve the problems\r\nof the financial markets are compatible with strategies\r\nintended to eradicate poverty. Because of the inherent\r\ninstability of financial and labour markets, it is clear that\r\nthere is a need to monitor, to regulate and to supervise. Yet\r\nit is clear too that the institutions needed for such activities\r\nare somewhat behind vis-à-vis the forces at work on the\r\ninternational scene, and an acceleration and revision of\r\ninternational development efforts is therefore necessary.\r\nThree basic elements have been identified for this purpose:\r\ntransparency, accountability and participation. Those\r\nelements are fundamental to the preparation of budgets\r\nbecause they can contribute to social cohesion and\r\nfinancial stability.\r\nLet me sum up: it has been said that social\r\nawareness and social contracts appear to be in danger and\r\nthat they must be protected. It has been said that the\r\nuniversality of basic principles as they apply to labour\r\nlaw is a necessary element in overcoming differences in\r\ninternational negotiations. The fragmentation of the labour\r\nmarket is another source of concern. We heard emphasis\r\nplaced on the role that can be played by transnational\r\ncorporations and enterprises towards socially responsible\r\nglobalization; the social consequences of globalization\r\nrelate to the revolution in information technologies. There\r\nis a new international culture; it must not be harmful to\r\nhumankind.\r\nBecause of the uneven distribution of the benefits\r\nand risks of globalization, developing and developed\r\ncountries should work together to draw up a new contract\r\nbased on genuine solidarity and shared responsibility, with\r\na view to conceiving and building a new, fair framework\r\nwithin which all countries will benefit from the process.\r\nA key issue here is a common vision of what constitutes\r\ngrowth and what constitutes universal development, a\r\nvision in which all countries and peoples benefit.\r\nThose were a few initial comments. A more detailed\r\nsummary of these meetings will be issued as a document\r\nof the General Assembly. A body of important documents\r\nand statements from countries and institutions already\r\nexists. Like the Secretary-General, we believe that we are\r\nhere making a contribution to ensuring that the United\r\nNations plays its proper role in this process.\r\nThe high-level dialogue has now come to an end.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n19\r\n"
