(Uruguay)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 10\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization\r\nPresentation by the Secretary-General of his\r\nannual report on the work of the Organization\r\n(A/53/1)\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): This\r\nmorning the General Assembly, in accordance with the\r\ndecision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting on 15 September\r\n1998, will first take up agenda item 10, entitled “Report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization”, to\r\nhear a brief presentation by the Secretary-General of his\r\nannual report.\r\nI give the floor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: It is my great pleasure and\r\nprivilege to welcome you all to this fifty-third session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I believe this could be a singularly\r\ninspiring and forward-looking session. Indeed, it could open\r\nnew vistas for the Organization, and even for the world,\r\nprovided we have the courage to confront what lies before\r\nus with open eyes.\r\nWhen I spoke to you from this podium a year ago, my\r\nemphasis was on reform of the United Nations itself.\r\nReform was and is essential if we are to play our full part\r\nin the new era.\r\nToday, I can say with satisfaction that the “quiet\r\nrevolution” is happening. The United Nations family has\r\nbegun to act with greater unity of purpose and coherence\r\nof effort than it did a year ago. This is particularly true of\r\nthe Secretariat and its relations with the programmes and\r\nfunds.\r\nThat does not mean that we can rest on our laurels.\r\nReform is an ongoing process, and I shall continue\r\nworking on ways to improve our performance. During\r\nthis session I hope you, the Member States, will carry the\r\nprocess forward, by adopting further measures to refine or\r\nrevise those aspects of the Organization which only you\r\nhave the power to change.\r\nBut probably the single greatest impediment to good\r\nperformance is the financial straitjacket within which we\r\noperate. Financial stringency is a feature of today’s world:\r\nit has helped concentrate our minds on giving you better\r\nvalue for your money. But without money there can be no\r\nvalue. Stringency is one thing, and a starvation diet is\r\nquite another.\r\nI appeal once again to those few Member States who\r\nhave fallen seriously behind in their contributions to\r\nfollow the good example set by others. There can be no\r\nsubstitute for full and timely payment of what is due.\r\nReform is gradually giving us a more functional\r\nUnited Nations, meaning one that can perform the tasks\r\nassigned to it by Member States. We need to define the\r\nnew challenges we face and devise suitable means for\r\nmeeting them.\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nIn 1945, at the end of the Second World War, our\r\nfounders had both the chance and the obligation to recast\r\nthe world order, creating this Organization to save future\r\ngenerations from repeating the ordeal which they had faced.\r\nToday, we in our turn are living through a vast\r\ntransformation.\r\nIn some ways our task is even more difficult than that\r\nof our founders. They could work from a tabula rasa,\r\nwhereas we have to respect established procedures and\r\novercome long-ingrained habits of thought. They faced the\r\nawesome but clearly defined challenge of world war, while\r\nwe are wrestling with new political uncertainties and with\r\nforces of economic change which are very hard to pin\r\ndown.\r\nBut an accident of the calendar gives us a precise and\r\ndramatic deadline to focus our minds: the opening of the\r\nthird millennium.\r\nYou have agreed to designate your fifty-fifth session,\r\nwhich falls in the year 2000, as a Millennium Assembly. I\r\nhave proposed to present a report to you on that occasion,\r\noutlining a set of workable objectives for the Organization\r\nas it moves into the new era, along with institutional means\r\nfor achieving them.\r\nWe have exactly two years before that Millennium\r\nAssembly. My idea is that we should use those two years\r\nto reflect carefully on what we need to do. We are not\r\ngoing to tear up the Charter and write a new one. Nor will\r\nwe produce a blueprint for Utopia. What we must do is\r\nidentify a select few of the world’s most pressing problems\r\nand set ourselves a precise, achievable programme for\r\ndealing with them. Much, if not all, of that programme, I\r\nsuspect, will be subsumed under a single rubric which has\r\nbecome the catchword of our time: globalization.\r\nI believe that, taken all in all, over the long term,\r\nglobalization will be positive. It draws peoples closer\r\ntogether and offers many of us choices that our\r\ngrandparents could not even dream of. It enables us to\r\nproduce more efficiently and allows some of us, at least, to\r\nimprove our quality of life.\r\nBut, alas, these benefits are far from being felt equally\r\nby all. The long-term positive change, for millions of our\r\nfellow human beings, simply is too far off to be\r\nmeaningful. Millions still live on the margins of the global\r\neconomy. Millions more are experiencing globalization not\r\nas an opportunity, but as a force of disruption or\r\ndestruction, as an assault on their material standards of\r\nliving or on their traditional way of life. And those who\r\nfeel marginalized in this way are growing more and more\r\nnumerous.\r\nThe Asian downturn has triggered a worldwide\r\neconomic crisis, with devastating social consequences.\r\nSome of the most successful economies have been\r\nplunged into recession at a speed which has taken the\r\nwhole international community by surprise.\r\nAs usual, it is the most vulnerable groups which are\r\nhardest hit. And the countries whose economies had taken\r\nonly the first faltering steps on the road to recovery are\r\nthe ones that now find themselves in greatest jeopardy.\r\nThe crisis has now spread to Russia. Even the markets of\r\nNorth America and Europe are not immune. President\r\nClinton recently recognized the threat which this wildfire\r\nposes, even to the largest economy in the world.\r\nWe have to get together to find the answers, but who\r\nshould sit at the table? The day is past when the seven\r\nmajor industrialized Powers could, or should, take on the\r\ntask alone. Nor can this crisis be left only to finance\r\nministers and central bankers, although their contribution\r\nis essential. I have no desire to belittle the role of the\r\ninstitutions where they get together, such as the Bank for\r\nInternational Settlements, the World Trade Organization\r\nor our beloved sister organizations in Washington, the\r\nWorld Bank and International Monetary Fund. As many\r\nhere know, I have worked hard to forge closer ties\r\nbetween the United Nations and those bodies, and I am\r\nglad to say they have been very responsive. They want to\r\nwork with us, and we must be ready to work with them.\r\nAll parts of the international system need to come\r\ntogether to find global solutions to this truly global crisis.\r\nFor the issues this crisis raises are not just financial\r\nor economic, or social or political, for that matter: they\r\nare all of those things at once. They must be addressed on\r\nall those fronts. They must be dealt with both locally and\r\nglobally. That is why I believe that this institution, the\r\nUnited Nations — which is the global institution par\r\nexcellence — has an inescapable duty to respond. I\r\ntherefore look forward to United Nations participation in\r\ndiscussions on the new world “financial architecture”,\r\nsuch as those suggested by President Clinton.\r\nTechnical economic and financial strategies are\r\ncertainly needed. But we have to define the political\r\nframework within which they can be applied. And we\r\nhave to make sure that the interests of those so far left\r\nbehind by globalization are not forgotten. Our special\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nresponsibility is to restore development to its rightful and\r\ncentral place in global economic strategy.\r\nOn the eve of the millennium, the needs and\r\naspirations of the great majority of human beings can still\r\nbe expressed simply and starkly: safe water, shelter from\r\nviolence — that of nature and that of one’s fellow men —\r\nenough food for the family, a job, schooling for the\r\nchildren and a State which does not oppress its citizens but\r\nrules with their consent.\r\nWe should not forget that the present crisis springs\r\npartly from the neglect of political factors during the years\r\nwhen some believed that market forces alone would bring\r\nworldwide prosperity. It was sometimes forgotten, in the\r\nexuberance of rapidly rising wealth, that in the long term a\r\nhealthy economy depends on healthy politics: the politics of\r\ngood governance, social justice and the rule of law.\r\nI am not suggesting a one-size-fits-all political model\r\nas a panacea for all the problems of globalization. That\r\nwould be as misguided as the one-size-fits-all economic\r\npolicy which has now come to grief in many countries.\r\nLocal traditions and circumstances must be borne in mind,\r\nboth in politics and in economics. But certain principles are\r\ncommon to all.\r\nThey include legitimate, responsive, clean government,\r\nwhatever its form; respect for human rights and the rights\r\nof minorities; freedom of expression; and the right to a fair\r\ntrial. If these essential, universal pillars are neglected, the\r\nstructure of both State and economy is deficient and is\r\nmore likely to collapse when the storm comes. This means\r\nthat the greatest challenge posed by globalization is that of\r\ngood governance in the broadest sense.\r\nLet me now turn briefly to the work of the\r\nOrganization over the past year. I will not bore the\r\nAssembly with a recapitulation of my annual report, which\r\nI am sure all have read by now from cover to cover. But\r\nforgive me if I draw attention to a few of our successes and\r\ntell the Assembly candidly where I feel we are currently\r\nfailing.\r\nThe thing I am happiest about is not what we do by\r\nourselves but the fruitful cooperation between this\r\nOrganization and non-State actors which, taken together,\r\nform the embryo of a global civil society. Two shining\r\nexamples from the past year are the International Campaign\r\nto Ban Landmines and the coalition of nongovernmental\r\norganizations which lobbied for an International Criminal\r\nCourt.\r\nThe former was the driving force behind the Ottawa\r\nConvention on anti-personnel mines, which I am delighted\r\nto say entered into force with the fortieth ratification last\r\nweek. The latter, of course, helped us achieve the Statute\r\nof the International Criminal Court, whose adoption in\r\nRome I was privileged to witness in July. This promises,\r\nat last, to supply what has for so long been the missing\r\nlink in the international legal system: a permanent court\r\nto judge the crimes of gravest concern to the international\r\ncommunity — genocide, crimes against humanity and war\r\ncrimes. This month the first judgement by an international\r\ncourt for the crime of genocide, delivered by the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, showed us\r\nthat the institutions of international justice can have teeth.\r\nIt also gives us hope that the International Criminal Court\r\nwill before too long fulfil its aim of putting an end to the\r\nshameful era in which a murderer is more likely to be\r\nconvicted for killing one person than for killing 100,000.\r\nGradually, with the help of civil society, the United\r\nNations and its Members States are strengthening the\r\ninternational legal order. The fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights makes us\r\nconscious this year more than ever of our responsibilities\r\nin this field.\r\nThe help we get from civil society in establishing\r\nlegal norms and strengthening human rights is one of the\r\npositive aspects of globalization. But here too the coin has\r\nits negative side.\r\nThe non-State actors which exploit the new openness\r\nand technology of communication are not all so benign.\r\nAlongside global civil society there is what I call uncivil\r\nsociety: the network of terrorism, trafficking — in human\r\nbeings as well as illicit substances — and organized\r\ncrime.\r\nWe had perhaps the most frightening glimpse yet of\r\nthis uncivil society a few weeks ago, with the terrorist\r\nbombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. Terrorism is a\r\nglobal menace which clearly calls for global action.\r\nIndividual actions by Member States, whether aimed at\r\nState or non-state actors, cannot in themselves provide a\r\nsolution. We must meet this threat together.\r\nWhat shocks us about terrorism is its indiscriminate\r\ncharacter. Unhappily, we have also to be concerned about\r\nviolence that is more precisely targeted. I regret to report\r\nthat this year has seen a dramatic increase in attacks on\r\nUnited Nations and associated personnel. This prompts us\r\nto reflect on the conditions in which we send civilian staff\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\ninto war zones where, too often, combatants seem less and\r\nless willing to respect their neutral status.\r\nI regret to say, also, that the perpetrators of these\r\nattacks are almost never brought to justice. Let us hope that\r\nthis will begin to change now that we have the Rome\r\nStatute, which defines intentional attacks against\r\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping staff as a war crime.\r\nI dwell on that point because I am responsible for the\r\nstaff and for the ability of the United Nations to carry out\r\nits mandate. But unhappily, humanity as a whole has much\r\nlarger threats to worry about. During the past year, the\r\nUnited Nations has been engaged in many parts of the\r\nworld, often in difficult and dangerous conditions, in the\r\nsensitive diplomacy of peacemaking. I myself went to Iraq\r\nto try to achieve full compliance with Security Council\r\nresolutions — something which, unhappily, has still not\r\nbeen realized.\r\nElsewhere, I believe we have had some successes in\r\npreventing conflict, though one can never absolutely prove\r\nthat without our efforts conflict would have happened.\r\nWhere we fail, by contrast, the results are all too\r\nvisible. And the truth is, we are still far from achieving the\r\nprimary task laid on us by our founders, “to save\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war”.\r\nTwo examples have preyed especially on my mind in\r\nrecent days: the continuing conflict in Afghanistan, with its\r\nhorrific human rights violations, is now perilously close to\r\ndrawing in neighbouring States. And in Kosovo the\r\ninternational community seems to be watching impotently\r\nwhile the kind of brutal and indiscriminate abuses we saw\r\nin Bosnia are repeated — something we swore must never\r\nhappen again.\r\nOnce again we find ourselves deploying desperate\r\nhumanitarian efforts to deal with consequences when we\r\nshould be addressing the political roots of conflict.\r\nI know the Security Council has both these conflicts\r\non its agenda, and I can only hope it will find effective\r\nways of recalling the parties to their obligations under the\r\nCharter.\r\nMeanwhile, the spectre of nuclear annihilation\r\ncontinues to haunt us. As is well known, two new countries\r\nhave chosen this year to conduct their first nuclear tests.\r\nAnd finally, I must say a word about my own\r\ncontinent of Africa. There too there have been successes,\r\nnotably the restoration of the democratically elected\r\nGovernment in Sierra Leone. In April, at the request of\r\nthe Security Council, I submitted a report on the causes\r\nof conflict in Africa, which was well received. Some\r\nuseful follow-up work has also been done.\r\nBut not only has conflict continued in many African\r\ncountries; it has also broken out in several new ones, and\r\nin one case between two Member States.\r\nI am especially concerned by the apparent crumbling\r\nof the peace process in Angola, a country where the\r\nUnited Nations has made enormous efforts for peace,\r\nparticularly under the leadership of Maître Alioune\r\nBlondin Beye, whose death in June was such a blow to\r\nall of us.\r\nAnd worst of all, I believe, is the new conflict in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, in which the forces of\r\nat least five African States are now involved and which\r\nadds a new twist to the long-running agony of the Great\r\nLakes. I feel acute concern for the ordinary people of that\r\nregion, who have suffered so much in recent years,\r\nincluding the scourge of deliberately fomented racial\r\nhatred. A special effort by the international community is\r\nneeded if stability is to be restored there and the suffering\r\nbrought to an end.\r\nI make no apology for ending on such a bleak note.\r\nMy intention is not to leave the Assembly in despair. On\r\nthe contrary, if we in this Hall really make up our minds\r\nto pool our resources, to set aside our differences and to\r\nwork together, there is almost nothing we could not\r\nachieve.\r\nIn particular, we need to rediscover the connection\r\nbetween peace and economic security — the unifying\r\nprinciple on which this Organization was founded. We\r\nneed to learn again the lesson of which one of our\r\nfounders, Franklin D. Roosevelt, spoke, in the year of his\r\ndeath and of this Organization’s birth. He said that\r\n“we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-\r\nbeing is dependent on the well-being of other\r\nnations, far away. We have learned that we must\r\nlive as men, and not as ostriches, nor as dogs in the\r\nmanger. We have learned to be citizens of the world,\r\nmembers of the human community.” (Fourth\r\nInaugural Address, 20 January 1945)\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nHe understood, in other words, that if there is no\r\ndevelopment, no hope for the poorest, even the richest on\r\nthis planet will not be safe.\r\nThis Assembly is not short of work. I have already\r\ndetained it too long, and I thank members for their\r\nindulgence. Now let us get on with it.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his statement.\r\nWe have concluded this stage of our consideration of\r\nagenda item 10.\r\nAgenda item 9\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): Before\r\ngiving the floor to the first speaker in the general debate, I\r\nshould like to remind members of the decision taken by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its 3rd plenary meeting, on 15\r\nSeptember, that congratulations should not be expressed\r\ninside the General Assembly Hall after a speech has been\r\ndelivered.\r\nIn this connection, may I also remind members of\r\nanother decision, taken by the Assembly at the same\r\nmeeting, that speakers in the general debate, after delivering\r\ntheir statements, would leave the Assembly Hall through\r\nroom GA-200, located behind the podium, before returning\r\nto their seats.\r\nI should also like to remind representatives that, in\r\naccordance with the decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly at its 3rd plenary meeting, the list of speakers\r\nwill be closed on 23 September 1998 at 6 p.m. May I\r\nrequest delegations to be good enough to provide estimate\r\nspeaking times that are as accurate as possible? This will\r\nfacilitate the work of the General Assembly.\r\nI should now like to call to the attention of members\r\nparagraph 21 of the annex to resolution 51/241, whereby\r\nthe General Assembly indicated a voluntary guideline of up\r\nto 20 minutes for each statement in the general debate.\r\nWithin this given time-frame, I should like to appeal to\r\nspeakers to deliver their statements at a normal speed, so\r\nthat interpretation of statements may be provided properly.\r\nI now give the floor to the first speaker in the\r\ngeneral debate, the Minister for Foreign Relations of\r\nBrazil, Mr. Luiz Felipe Lampreia.\r\nMr. Lampreia (Brazil): Mr. President, your election\r\nto preside over the fifty-third session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly is especially gratifying for us\r\nBrazilians. Brazil and Uruguay came into being as sister\r\nnations, and our bonds are becoming ever stronger. With\r\neach passing day, our destinies are more and more linked\r\ntogether. The opportunity I have of working closely with\r\nmy friend, Didier Opertti, allows me to say with\r\nconviction that at this session the Assembly will have a\r\nformidable President. In the exercise of this important\r\ntask, you will benefit from the example set by your\r\npredecessor. At the helm of the fifty-second session,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko was able to guide and motivate\r\ndelegations and to provide valuable impulse to the\r\nproposals for reform put forward by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nBecause of his dedication to the task of modernizing\r\nour Organization and, above all, because of his decisive\r\nrole in situations that pose a real threat to international\r\npeace and security, the Secretary-General deserves our\r\napplause. The diplomatic talent and serene daring revealed\r\nby Mr. Kofi Annan confirm that we have in him a leader\r\nwho is up to the challenges and opportunities before us.\r\nIt was an honour for us to have welcomed him in Brazil\r\nthis past July.\r\nThe defining trait of this particular moment is the\r\ntroubling instability that besets global financial markets.\r\nSince the last quarter of 1997, when we first felt the\r\nshock waves of what was then called the “Asian crisis”,\r\nthe world economy has been suffering the effects of a\r\nphenomenon whose reach, depth and permanence are still\r\nnot clear. But the international community cannot wait,\r\nwith arms crossed, for the course of events to shed light\r\non our quandary.\r\nIt is both legitimate and necessary that Governments\r\nact to try to prevent problems that may arise. In an era\r\nmarked by the rapid integration of national economies,\r\nsuch action by Governments will increasingly have to be\r\nmade through coordination in the international sphere.\r\nAlthough there is still no consensus as to the\r\ndimension of the crisis we face, nor on the prognosis for\r\nits duration, there seems to be a growing convergence of\r\npoints of view regarding the impact of the high volatility\r\nof capital movements. The events of the past few months\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nhave revealed a serious lag between growing financial\r\ninterdependence and the modest effectiveness of existing\r\ninternational mechanisms for dialogue and coordination.\r\nSince the beginning of his Administration, President\r\nFernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil has been calling the\r\nattention of other world leaders to the task of making the\r\nglobal financial system more stable and predictable. In\r\nrepeated messages to G-7 members, beginning in 1995, he\r\noffered concrete proposals: to increase cooperation among\r\nmonetary authorities; to expand coordination of\r\nmacroeconomic policies among countries that can have\r\nconsiderable impact on world finance; to upgrade\r\ninternational monitoring capacity over domestic\r\nmacroeconomic policy; and to expand mechanisms aimed\r\nat stabilizing currencies under speculative attack. There\r\nhave been, of course, considerable advances along some of\r\nthese lines, but the measures adopted still fall far short of\r\nwhat is needed. Until now, political will has not\r\ncorresponded to the magnitude and gravity of the situation.\r\nThe crisis will not resolve itself. We must join together to\r\nface it.\r\nIn this, as in other fields of international life, we must\r\navoid at all costs an attitude that, back in the seventies,\r\nBrazilian Foreign Minister Azeredo da Silveira described as\r\n“the postponement syndrome”.\r\nExperience teaches us that inaction can have a high\r\ncost. It also teaches that answers given by various countries\r\nto crisis situations, if guided by irrational or spur-of-the-\r\nmoment reactions, can turn these situations into even\r\ngreater problems, prolonging their effects over time and\r\naggravating people’s suffering.\r\nOne can imagine extreme scenarios of a return to\r\nclosed economic models, to the search for elusive self-\r\nsufficiency and isolation, to notions of national security\r\nbased on distrust of others and on the insecurity of others.\r\nSuch scenarios must not become reality. We cannot allow\r\nit.\r\nProgress in international relations depends\r\nfundamentally on the perception of the international arena\r\nnot as a source of potential threat, but as an environment in\r\nwhich risks can be reduced and difficulties overcome by a\r\npooling of wills and resources.\r\nOurs is not a world in which nations should be left to\r\ntheir own devices. The cost of such a course is invariably\r\nhigher than the energy or resources saved by attempts to\r\ndistance oneself from the problems of others. The\r\nwillingness to deal collectively with problems will\r\nmotivate individual countries to believe in the benefit of\r\nseeking international consideration of matters in their\r\ndirect interest. The world cannot depend only on the\r\nwillingness, capacity and interest of a select number of\r\ncountries to mobilize and lead international efforts in this\r\nor that direction.\r\nWe can no longer accept situations, such as the\r\npresent financial crisis, in which, despite the undeniably\r\ninternational nature of the phenomenon, Governments and\r\nsocieties simply do not fully trust any of the existing\r\norganizations or mechanisms as a source of support,\r\nguidance or even interpretation of the problem at hand.\r\nWe must give serious consideration to the fact that\r\ngrowing interdependence renders indispensable effective\r\ngovernance at the international level.\r\nWe have before us an essentially political challenge.\r\nThis does not mean simply modernizing decision-making\r\nprocedures or administrative structures, but also giving to\r\nmultilateral treatment of issues the priority it so often\r\nreceives in our speeches and statements.\r\nA large gap still remains between the recognition\r\nthat the central problems facing humanity must be dealt\r\nwith at the international level and the resistance of\r\nGovernments and societies to act in accordance with that\r\nrecognition. This is most evident in the allocation of\r\nresources and in the adoption of policies capable of\r\ngenerating external repercussions.\r\nIn that same vein, if the link between the national\r\nand the international is ever greater, peace and\r\ndevelopment are also increasingly related. A world racked\r\nby economic instability or despair cannot be a safe\r\nenvironment, free of the threat of war, conflict and\r\nviolence. But the reverse is also true: material and social\r\nprogress presupposes minimal conditions of security and\r\npeaceful coexistence among and within countries. We\r\nmust advance on both fronts by working to establish a\r\nclimate of confidence in the political-strategic realm and\r\nin the essential context of the global economy.\r\nBrazil’s relative weight and the history of our\r\ninternational behaviour are some of our country’s most\r\nimportant credentials. These credentials are strengthened\r\ntoday by the maturity of our democracy and by the\r\nvigorous modernization of the Brazilian economy.\r\nUnder the leadership of President Cardoso, we have\r\nrenewed our permanent willingness to play a more active\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nrole in building a world order conducive to peace and\r\ndevelopment. This spirit guides Brazil’s international action,\r\nparticularly within the United Nations.\r\nI wish to point out that, in the Security Council and\r\nother United Nations bodies, our delegation, led by\r\nAmbassador Celso Amorim, has faithfully reflected this\r\ncentral guideline of Brazilian foreign policy.\r\nIn 1998, we have completed our participation in the\r\ninternational non-proliferation regime. We have ratified the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and\r\nacceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT), which was approved by Brazil’s National\r\nCongress this past July. Three days ago in Washington, I\r\nhad the satisfaction of personally depositing the instrument\r\nof accession to the NPT, in tandem with our Ambassadors\r\nin London and Moscow.\r\nThese decisions lend formal and symbolic support to\r\nthe commitment to use nuclear energy for exclusively\r\npeaceful purposes. This commitment is enshrined in the\r\nBrazilian Constitution and is strengthened by the bilateral\r\nand regional pacts we have signed. The existing agreements\r\nand the cooperation between Brazil and Argentina, as well\r\nas the Treaty of Tlatelolco, are exemplary achievements in\r\nthis field.\r\nBrazil thus feels particularly motivated to call upon\r\nnuclear-armed States, and upon those with the capability of\r\nproducing such weapons, to take decisive steps towards\r\ndisarmament. We also expect that Governments which have\r\nstill not become party to the NPT, the CTBT and other\r\nrelevant instruments and mechanisms will do so at an early\r\ndate.\r\nAs an expression of the determination which motivates\r\nus to work for this cause, Brazil, together with seven other\r\nfriendly countries, signed the “Declaration on a Nuclear\r\nWeapon Free World: the Need for a New Agenda” on 9\r\nJune of this year. During the current session of the General\r\nAssembly, together with our partners in the Declaration, we\r\nintend to present a draft resolution aimed at boosting and\r\nguiding efforts towards the complete and definitive\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nThere is no longer room or justification for postponing\r\naction in the nuclear field or in the broader fight to\r\neliminate all weapons of mass destruction. The cost of a\r\nfailure to do so could be truly catastrophic, and the risks\r\nare evident to all.\r\nThe Brazilian Government, as the coordinator of the\r\nguarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, has\r\nbeen making a sustained effort to assist Ecuador and Peru\r\nin reaching at the earliest possible date a solid and final\r\nagreement on the border differences that have kept them\r\napart for decades. Our diplomatic services — together\r\nwith those of Argentina, Chile and the United States —\r\nstand ready to continue making the best possible\r\ncontribution.\r\nRecent developments confirm the prognosis that the\r\npeace process is on its way to a conclusion and reflect the\r\npolitical will and the high level of engagement with\r\nwhich Ecuador and Peru have been working towards that\r\nend.\r\nThe fact that South America is a region in which\r\ncountries essentially live in a harmonious, peaceful and\r\nincreasingly integrated manner is for Brazil a vital and\r\ndefining trait that our peoples are determined to preserve.\r\nThe same applies to the permanence of democratic\r\nregimes as a common thread of the nations in our\r\ncontinent. It is a higher value to which we are collectively\r\ncommitted in the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR), the Rio Group and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS).\r\nThe advent and consolidation of democracy was the\r\ndetermining factor in the extraordinary work of\r\nintegration in which South American nations are engaged.\r\nThis is an accomplishment of our societies that the\r\nGovernments of the region must always be prepared to\r\ndefend as one. This is a basic tenet of Brazilian foreign\r\npolicy.\r\nBrazil attaches the utmost importance to the\r\nadvancement of human rights. As we celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, we should recognize the persistent gap between\r\nprinciples and generally accepted rules of international\r\nlaw, on the one hand, and the prevalent realities of the\r\nworld, on the other.\r\nThe Brazilian Government is engaged in the fight to\r\novercome the distance between norms and facts in our\r\ncountry. We are prepared to draw from the international\r\nenvironment elements that may help us realize an\r\naspiration shared by all Brazilians. This was the main\r\nthrust of President Cardoso’s submission to the National\r\nCongress of the decision to recognize the mandatory\r\njurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nPresident Cardoso is also committed to the fight\r\nagainst the drug trade. His presence at the special session\r\nof the General Assembly this past June was clear proof of\r\nthis commitment.\r\nOur participation in the effort to build a lasting peace\r\nextends beyond the Americas. The Brazilian military and\r\npolice have taken part in United Nations forces in many\r\nparts of the world, particularly in Portuguese-speaking\r\ncountries in Africa, to which we are bound by history and\r\nculture.\r\nBrazil has followed developments in Angola with\r\nconcern. The United Nations must firmly insist that UNITA\r\nfulfil the commitments undertaken in the Lusaka Protocol.\r\nAn unravelling of the situation could jeopardize the\r\nprogress achieved in the peace process and would be tragic\r\nindeed. Angolans have been subjected to untold suffering\r\nfor decades. The international community must do\r\neverything within its reach so that Angola may finally\r\ndedicate itself to reconstruction and development.\r\nThe Brazilian Government, along with the other\r\nmembers of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\r\nCountries, is engaged in seeking a peaceful solution to the\r\ngrave internal crisis faced by Guinea-Bissau. The\r\nCommunity, in close coordination with countries in the\r\nregion, has contributed to spurring significant progress. We\r\nwill continue to pursue favourable conditions for the urgent\r\nand complete normalization of life in that sister nation.\r\nAs for East Timor — to which we are also bound by\r\nhistory and a common language — Brazil welcomes the\r\nnew spirit that presides over this delicate and complex\r\nissue, especially in the context of the tripartite negotiations\r\nbetween the Portuguese and Indonesian Governments, under\r\nthe auspices of the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Brazilian Government has maintained a positive\r\ndialogue with the parties involved and is determined to\r\nassist, to the limit of its possibilities, in finding an adequate\r\nequation for all concerned, with progressive participation by\r\nthe Timorese themselves.\r\nSince the advent of economic stability in 1994, Brazil\r\nhas shown renewed dynamism with the strengthening of our\r\ndomestic market and the outlook for development with\r\nsocial justice.\r\nBut present-day Brazil does not see its development as\r\nisolated or self-contained. We realize that the destiny of our\r\neconomy is increasingly linked to that of the economies of\r\nour neighbours and partners, in the framework of an\r\nintegration process that has decidedly contributed to\r\nprogress in the region and to the well-being of our\r\nsocieties, particularly within MERCOSUR.\r\nThe fruits of this process serve not only the goal of\r\neconomic development but also, and most importantly, the\r\ncause of social justice, which remains the foremost task\r\nof our region.\r\nWe welcome the results of the most recent edition of\r\nthe United Nations Human Development Report. The\r\nnumbers show that, in spite of all that remains to be done,\r\nour country has made extraordinary social progress over\r\nthe past two decades in the areas of health, education, the\r\nfight against poverty and the reduction of disparities\r\namong the various regions of the country. Even though\r\nwe still face daunting challenges, Brazilians are leading\r\na better life, as our presence among those nations of\r\ngreater human development indicates.\r\nConsistent with its domestic policies and its regional\r\nrole, Brazil will continue to fight for a more balanced\r\nallocation of the benefits of economic interdependence,\r\nwithout distortions such as those resulting from\r\nprotectionist policies of developed countries.\r\nSuch policies affect in a particularly cruel manner\r\nthe developing countries and serve to reinforce the\r\narguments of those who preach domestically a return to\r\nclosed economic models. In the current context of global\r\neconomic turbulence, we must demand that the developed\r\ncountries establish greater coherence between free-trade\r\nrhetoric and their unfair trade practices.\r\nPresident Cardoso has stated that we must abandon\r\nthe path of globalization with exclusion — in the\r\ndecision-making process as well as in the distribution of\r\nbenefits — and seek globalization with solidarity in both\r\nof those dimensions.\r\nReforming and strengthening the United Nations is\r\nan essential part of building a world of greater solidarity.\r\nThe Brazilian Government recognizes the significant\r\nprogress that has already been made in terms of structural\r\nand functional modernization of the Organization. We\r\nagree with the Secretary-General when he says that\r\nreform must not be seen as an event, but as a process; but\r\nwe cannot but stress that an important part of that process\r\nhas yet to be undertaken.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nFor Brazil, reforming the United Nations necessarily\r\nimplies updating the functioning and composition of the\r\nSecurity Council, which still mirrors a period of history that\r\nis now long gone. That does not mean — and I have stated\r\nthis before in this forum — that the particular interests of\r\nthis or that country should be taken into account. What it\r\ndoes mean is that fundamental deficiencies in terms of\r\nlegitimacy, representativeness and effectiveness must be\r\nredressed. We will continue to defend expansion in both\r\ncategories of members, with the presence, in both, of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIt is inconceivable that, on the eve of the new\r\nmillennium, reform of the Organization could exclude the\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council.\r\nThe basis of global solidarity is the establishment of\r\ntrust between societies. There is no other way if we are to\r\nestablish a peaceful, stable and constructive international\r\nenvironment. Our so-called global village is still far from\r\nbecoming a truly integrated community, in which people\r\ncan consider themselves as participants in the same\r\nhistorical process.\r\nOf the many merits of international organizations, one\r\nof the most important is that they offer a framework of\r\ninteraction that favours the development of a true sense of\r\nuniversal communion. In dealing with common problems,\r\nGovernments learn in practice just how much they need to\r\nwork more and more closely together. In international\r\nforums, we are constantly weaving a web of relations based\r\non a stronger identity and trust between our nations and\r\ntheir leaders. Countries must trust one another, but they\r\nmust also have a reason to trust in the legitimacy and\r\nefficiency of multilateral organizations and procedures in\r\norder to tackle their most important problems.\r\nThe dynamics of international life demand a constant\r\nupdating of the instruments at the disposal of the\r\ncommunity of nations to allow it to act collectively in the\r\nface of its greatest challenges.\r\nWe must have the courage to recognize that never\r\nbefore have the risks and the cost of procrastination been so\r\nhigh. We must, above all, have the will to make the\r\ndecisions that can ultimately restore our faith in ourselves,\r\nin our capacity to state that history does goes on, and that\r\nwe are pointing it in the direction of a more just and better\r\nworld.\r\nAddress by Mr. William J. Clinton, President of the\r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe United States of America.\r\nMr. William J. Clinton, President of the United\r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nUnited States of America, His Excellency Mr. William J.\r\nClinton, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Clinton: Let me begin by thanking the\r\nAssembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by\r\nnoting that, at the opening of this fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the world has much to celebrate.\r\nPeace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years.\r\nBosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The United\r\nNations is actively mediating crises before they explode\r\ninto war, all around the world. And today more people\r\ndetermine their own destiny than at any previous moment\r\nin history.\r\nWe celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights with those rights more\r\nwidely embraced than ever before. On every continent\r\npeople are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and\r\na great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United\r\nNations.\r\nStill, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise\r\nof our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil\r\ntoday threatens to undermine confidence in free markets\r\nand democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from\r\nthis economy have a special responsibility to do more to\r\nminimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global\r\nmarkets to all citizens. And the United States is\r\ndetermined to do that.\r\nWe still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious\r\nand tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many\r\nStates to acquire such weapons.\r\nAnd, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not\r\nfading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a\r\ncontinuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which says\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\n“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of\r\nperson.”\r\nHere at the United Nations, at international summits\r\naround the world and on many occasions in the United\r\nStates, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in\r\ndetail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing\r\nand what we must yet do to combat terror.\r\nToday I would like to talk to the Assembly about why\r\nall nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of\r\nour agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern\r\nto us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted\r\nover and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi\r\nArabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own\r\ncitizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public\r\nbuildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and\r\nDar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives\r\nto building bridges between nations — people very much\r\nlike all of those present — died in a campaign of hatred\r\nagainst the United States.\r\nBecause we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with\r\na powerful military and a worldwide presence active in\r\npromoting peace and security, we are often a target. We\r\nlove our country for its dedication to political and religious\r\nfreedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights\r\nof the individual. But we know that many people see us as\r\na symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they\r\nfind it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots\r\nelsewhere.\r\nBut we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we\r\nbelieve the best way to disprove these claims is to continue\r\nour work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us\r\nto pull back from the world’s trouble spots, to turn our\r\nbacks on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own\r\nopposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace\r\na victory they must never have.\r\nStill, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as\r\nonly, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a\r\nclear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and\r\ninnocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the\r\npeople represented here, is immune. Certainly not the\r\npeople of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American\r\nkilled there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500\r\nmore injured — innocent people going about their business\r\non a busy morning.\r\nNot the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where\r\nthe wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants\r\nalike — mostly children and women, two of them\r\npregnant — people out shopping together when their\r\nfuture was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the\r\npast.\r\nNot the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin\r\ngas in the Tokyo subway.\r\nNot the people of Argentina, who died when a car\r\nbomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos\r\nAires.\r\nNot the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by\r\nancient animosities that cry out for resolution.\r\nNot the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year\r\nafter year, for all their progress towards peace.\r\nNot the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of\r\nunfathomable terror with still no end in sight.\r\nNot the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second\r\nPresident to assassination.\r\nNot the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,\r\nRussia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where\r\ninnocent people have been victimized by terror.\r\nNone of those victims were American. But every\r\none was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or\r\nmother — a human life extinguished by someone else’s\r\nhatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never\r\nbe the same.\r\nTerror has become the world’s problem. Some argue,\r\nof course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the\r\nnumber of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,\r\nsometimes less than the number of people killed by\r\nlightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point\r\nin several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the\r\n1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater\r\nopenness and the explosion of information and weapons\r\ntechnology. The new technologies of terror and their\r\nincreasing availability, along with the increasing mobility\r\nof terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to\r\nchemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing\r\neach of us into the category of possible victim. This is a\r\nthreat to all humankind.\r\nBeyond the physical damage of each attack, there is\r\nan even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to\r\nmeasure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nthreat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;\r\nthe kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so\r\nhard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or\r\nchild is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the\r\nrest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so\r\ncrucial to peace and prosperity.\r\nIn every corner of the world, with the active support\r\nof United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build\r\nbetter futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with\r\ntheir fellow citizens and with partners and investors from\r\naround the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in\r\nNorthern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday\r\nAgreement. But that took confidence, confidence that\r\ncannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure\r\neach attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But\r\nwhat are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle\r\nEast, in Asia, in South America — how many agreements\r\nhave been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many\r\nbusinesses will never be created in places crying out for\r\ninvestments of time and money? How many talented young\r\npeople in countries represented here have turned their backs\r\non public service? The question is not only how many lives\r\nhave been lost in each attack, but how many futures were\r\nlost in their aftermath.\r\nThere is no justification for killing innocents.\r\nIdeology, religion and politics, even deprivation and\r\nrighteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to\r\nunderstand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of\r\ncourse we must. Often in my own experience I have seen\r\nthat where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate\r\nact to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing\r\ncame as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the\r\nMiddle East, whenever we get close to another step towards\r\npeace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this\r\nstall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,\r\nafter all, a leap of faith — a break with the past — and\r\nthus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their\r\nown hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases\r\nterrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.\r\nWe must also acknowledge that there are economic\r\nsources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses\r\nof disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the\r\nsiren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing\r\nsocial justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor\r\ncan inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents\r\nis not a social programme.\r\nNevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does\r\nnot mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that\r\nfoster it. The most recent United Nations Human\r\nDevelopment Report suggests the gulf is widening\r\nbetween the world’s haves and have-nots. We must work\r\nharder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into\r\nthe poison of hatred.\r\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only\r\nrevolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must\r\nshow people they have everything to gain by embracing\r\ncooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply\r\nan American or a Western responsibility; it is the world’s\r\nresponsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to\r\nspread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to\r\nbuild new, open economies. Developed nations have an\r\nobligation to help developing nations stay on the path of\r\nprosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week\r\nago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international\r\neconomy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens\r\nwithin them.\r\nSome believe that terrorism’s principal fault line\r\ncentres on what they see as an inevitable clash of\r\ncivilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate\r\nin this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an\r\ninevitable clash between Western civilization and values\r\nand Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is\r\nterribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any\r\nreligion to justify whatever political objectives they\r\nhave — even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the\r\nworld believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,\r\ngrants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding\r\nof Islam.\r\nA quarter of the world’s population is Muslim, from\r\nAfrica to the Middle East to Asia and to the United\r\nStates, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.\r\nThere are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the\r\nUnited States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The\r\n6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there\r\nis no inherent clash between Islam and America.\r\nAmericans respect and honour Islam.\r\nAs I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and\r\naround the world, I see again that we share the same\r\nhopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to\r\nprovide for our children, to follow the faith of our\r\nchoosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and\r\nto pass on brighter possibilities to our children.\r\nOf course, we are not identical. There are important\r\ndifferences that cross race and culture and religion which\r\ndemand understanding and deserve respect. But every\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nriver has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in\r\nAmerica, like the United Nations, to reconcile all\r\nAmericans to each other and to find greater unity in our\r\nincreasing diversity, we will remain on a course of\r\nfriendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will\r\ncontinue to look for common values, common interests and\r\ncommon endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit\r\nexpressed by these words of Mohammed: “Rewards for\r\nprayers by people assembled together are twice those for\r\nprayers said at home.”\r\nWhen it comes to terrorism, there should be no\r\ndividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and\r\nCatholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and\r\nemerging countries. The only dividing line is between those\r\nwho practise, support or tolerate terror and those who\r\nunderstand that it is murder, plain and simple.\r\nIf terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and\r\nshould be at the top of the world’s agenda, what, then, are\r\nthe concrete steps we can take together to protect our\r\ncommon destiny? What are our common obligations? At\r\nleast, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,\r\nno sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on\r\nStates that do; to act together to step up extradition and\r\nprosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to\r\nstrengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger\r\ndomestic laws and control the manufacture and export of\r\nexplosives; to raise international standards for airport\r\nsecurity; to combat the conditions that spread violence and\r\ndespair.\r\nWe are working to do our part. Our intelligence and\r\nlaw enforcement communities are tracking terrorist\r\nnetworks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of\r\nthose we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our\r\nembassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I\r\nwill ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to\r\nrepair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the\r\nworldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in\r\nKenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.\r\nBut no matter how much each of us does alone, our\r\nprogress will be limited without our common efforts.\r\nWe will also do our part to address the sources of\r\ndespair and alienation through the Agency for International\r\nDevelopment in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in\r\nEastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue\r\nour strong support for the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, the World Bank and the World\r\nFood Programme. We also recognize the critical role\r\nthese agencies play and the importance of all countries,\r\nincluding the United States, in paying their fair share.\r\nIn closing, let me urge all of us to think in new\r\nterms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or\r\npolitical action by other means, or a divine calling, but as\r\na clash between the forces of the past and the forces of\r\nthe future, between those who tear down and those who\r\nbuild up, between hope and fear, between chaos and\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe fight will not be easy. But every nation will be\r\nstrengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning\r\nto the words of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important\r\nthat we do this together.\r\nEleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the\r\nUniversal Declaration. She said, in one of her many\r\nspeeches in support of the United Nations when it was\r\njust beginning,\r\n“All agreements and all peace are built on\r\nconfidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot\r\nget on with other people in the world unless you\r\nhave confidence in them.”\r\nIt is not necessary that we solve all the world’s\r\nproblems to have confidence in one another. It is not\r\nnecessary that we agree on all the world’s issues to have\r\nconfidence in one another. It is not even necessary that\r\nwe understand every single difference among us to have\r\nconfidence in one another. But it is necessary that we\r\naffirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together\r\nwe say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a\r\nthrowback to yesterday, and together, together we can\r\nmeet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears\r\nwith confidence.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the United States of America for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. William J. Clinton, President of the United\r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nAddress by Mr. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, President\r\nof the Republic of South Africa\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa.\r\nMr. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, His Excellency Mr. Nelson\r\nRolihlahla Mandela, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Mandela: Mr. President, may I take this\r\nopportunity, as President of the Republic of South Africa\r\nand as Chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement, to\r\nextend to you our sincere congratulations on your election\r\nto the high post of President of the General Assembly.\r\nYou will be presiding over this august Assembly of\r\nthe nations of the world at a time when its deliberations and\r\ndecisions will be of the greatest consequence to the\r\ncontinuous striving of humanity at last to achieve global\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement, as well as my own\r\ncountry, which is a proud member of that Movement,\r\ninvests great trust in this Organization to discharge its\r\nresponsibilities to all nations, especially at this critical\r\nperiod of its existence.\r\nQuite appropriately, this fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will be remembered through the ages as\r\nthe moment at which we marked and celebrated the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. Born in the aftermath of the defeat of the\r\nNazi and fascist crime against humanity, this Declaration\r\nheld high the hope that all our societies would, in future, be\r\nbuilt on the foundations of the glorious vision spelt out in\r\neach of its clauses.\r\nFor those who had to fight for their emancipation,\r\nthose such as ourselves, who, with United Nations help, had\r\nto free ourselves from the criminal apartheid system, the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights served as the\r\nvindication of the justice of our cause.\r\nAt the same time, it constituted a challenge to us\r\nthat our freedom, once achieved, should be dedicated to\r\nthe implementation of the perspectives contained in the\r\nDeclaration.\r\nToday we celebrate the fact that this historic\r\ndocument has survived a turbulent five decades, which\r\nhave seen some of the most extraordinary developments\r\nin the evolution of human society.\r\nThese include the collapse of the colonial system,\r\nthe passing of a bipolar world, breathtaking advances in\r\nscience and technology and the achievement of the\r\ncomplex process of globalization.\r\nAnd yet, at the end of it all, the human beings who\r\nare the subject of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights continue to be afflicted by wars and violent\r\nconflicts.\r\nThey have, as yet, not attained their freedom from\r\nfear of death that would be brought about by the use of\r\nweapons of mass destruction as well as conventional\r\narms.\r\nMany are still unable to exercise the fundamental\r\nand inalienable democratic rights that would enable them\r\nto participate in the determination of the destiny of their\r\ncountries, nations, families and children and to protect\r\nthemselves from tyranny and dictatorship.\r\nThe very right to be human is denied every day to\r\nhundreds of millions of people as a result of poverty and\r\nthe unavailability of basic necessities, such as food, jobs,\r\nwater and shelter, education, health care and a healthy\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe failure to achieve the vision contained in the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights finds dramatic\r\nexpression in the contrast between wealth and poverty\r\nwhich characterizes the divide between the countries of\r\nthe North and the countries of the South and within\r\nindividual countries in all hemispheres.\r\nIt is made especially poignant and challenging by the\r\nfact that this coexistence of wealth and poverty, the\r\nperpetuation of the practice of the resolution of inter-State\r\nand intra-State conflicts by war and the denial of the\r\ndemocratic right of many across the world, all result from\r\nacts of commission and omission, particularly by those\r\nwho occupy positions of leadership in politics, in the\r\neconomy, and in other spheres of human activity.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nWhat I am trying to say is that all these social ills,\r\nwhich constitute an offence against the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, are not a preordained result\r\nof the forces of nature or the product of a curse of the\r\ndeities.\r\nThey are the consequence of decisions which men and\r\nwomen take or refuse to take, men and women all of whom\r\nwill not hesitate to pledge their devoted support for the\r\nvision conveyed in the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights.\r\nThis Declaration was proclaimed as universal precisely\r\nbecause the founders of this Organization and the nations\r\nof the world that joined hands to fight the scourge of\r\nfascism, including many that still had to achieve their own\r\nemancipation, understood clearly that our human world was\r\nan interdependent whole. Necessarily, the values of\r\nhappiness, justice, human dignity, peace and prosperity\r\nhave a universal application, because each people and every\r\nindividual is entitled to them. Similarly, no people can truly\r\nsay it is blessed with happiness, peace and prosperity where\r\nothers, as human as themselves, continue to be afflicted\r\nwith misery, conflict, terrorism and deprivation.\r\nThus can we say that the challenge posed by the next\r\n50 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and\r\nby the next century whose character it must help to fashion,\r\nconsists in whether humanity, and especially those who will\r\noccupy positions of leadership, will have the courage to\r\nensure that at last we build a human world consistent with\r\nthe provisions of that historic Declaration and other human\r\nrights instruments that have been adopted since 1948.\r\nImmediately, a whole range of areas of conflict\r\nconfronts us, in Africa, Europe and Asia. All of us are\r\nfamiliar with these, which range from the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Angola and Sudan on my own\r\ncontinent, to the Balkans in Europe and Afghanistan,\r\nTajikistan and Sri Lanka in Asia.\r\nClearly, this Organization, and especially the Security\r\nCouncil, acting together with people of goodwill in the\r\ncountries and areas concerned, has a responsibility to act\r\ndecisively to contribute to the termination of these\r\ndestructive conflicts. Continuously, we have to fight to\r\ndefeat the primitive tendency towards the glorification of\r\narms, the adulation of force, born of the illusion that justice\r\ncan be guaranteed by the capacity to kill, or that disputes\r\nare necessarily best resolved by resort to violent means.\r\nAs Africans, we are grateful to the Secretary-General\r\nfor the contribution he has made to help us find the way\r\ntowards ending violent strife on our continent. We have\r\ntaken heed of his report, which will reinforce our efforts\r\nto banish war from our shores. I have not yet read the\r\nreport from page to page, but I will try to do so.\r\nThe very first resolution of the General Assembly,\r\nadopted in January 1946, sought to address the challenge\r\nof\r\n“the elimination from national armaments of atomic\r\nweapons and of all other major weapons adaptable\r\nto mass destruction”. (resolution 1 (I), para. 5 (c))\r\nWe must face the fact that after countless initiatives\r\nand resolutions, we still do not have concrete and\r\ngenerally accepted proposals supported by a clear\r\ncommitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the speedy,\r\nfinal and total elimination of nuclear weapons and\r\nnuclear-weapon capabilities.\r\nWe take this opportunity to salute our sister\r\nRepublic of Brazil for its decision to accede to the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to urge\r\nall others that have not yet done so to follow this\r\nexcellent example.\r\nIn an honest attempt to contribute to the definition\r\nof the systematic and progressive steps required to\r\neliminate these weapons and the threat of annihilation\r\nwhich they pose, South Africa, together with Brazil,\r\nEgypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and\r\nSweden, will be submitting a draft resolution to the First\r\nCommittee for consideration by the Assembly. It is\r\nappropriately titled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nworld: the need for a new agenda”.\r\nI call with all humility on all Members of the United\r\nNations seriously to consider this important draft\r\nresolution and to give it their support. We must ask the\r\nquestion, which might sound naive to those who have\r\nelaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusal\r\nto eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of mass\r\ndestruction — why do they need them, anyway?\r\nIn reality, no rational answer can be advanced to\r\nexplain in a satisfactory manner what, in the end, is the\r\nconsequence of cold-war inertia and an attachment to the\r\nuse of the threat of brute force to assert the primacy of\r\nsome States over others.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nUrgent steps are also required to arrive at a just and\r\npermanent peace in the Middle East on the basis of the\r\nrealization of the legitimate aspirations of the people of\r\nPalestine and respect for the independence and security of\r\nall the States of this important region. We also look\r\nforward to the resolution of the outstanding issues of\r\nWestern Sahara and East Timor, convinced that it is\r\npossible to take these matters off the world agenda on the\r\nbasis of settlements that meet the interests of all the peoples\r\nconcerned.\r\nSimilarly, we would like to salute the bold steps taken\r\nby the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, this\r\nsupremely important country of Africa, to enable it to\r\nreturn to democratic rule and a system of governance\r\ndirected at serving the interests of all its people.\r\nTogether we are also faced with the scourges of drug\r\nabuse and the illicit traffic in narcotics, organized\r\ntransnational crime and international terrorism. We strongly\r\nsupport the measures adopted or being discussed by the\r\nUnited Nations to deal with these challenges and commit\r\nour country and Government to cooperate fully in all\r\nregional and international initiatives to ensure that the\r\npeoples of the world, including our own, are spared the\r\ndestructive impact of these crimes.\r\nThe world is gripped by an economic crisis, which, as\r\nPresident Clinton said in this city only a week ago, has\r\nplunged millions into sudden poverty and disrupted and\r\ndisoriented the lives of ordinary people, and brought deep\r\npersonal disappointment to tens of millions of people\r\naround the world.\r\nPresident Clinton also said:\r\n“Recent press reports have described an entire\r\ngeneration working its way into the middle class for\r\nover 25 years, then being plummeted into poverty\r\nwithin a matter of months. The stories are\r\nheartbreaking — doctors and nurses forced to live in\r\nthe lobby of a closed hospital; middle-class families\r\nwho owned their own homes, sent their children to\r\ncollege, travelled abroad, now living by selling their\r\npossessions.”\r\nPresident Clinton said that “fast-moving currents” in\r\nthe world economy\r\n“have brought or aggravated problems in Russia and\r\nAsia. They threaten emerging economies from Latin\r\nAmerica to South Africa”,\r\nand he spoke of sacrificing lives in the name of economic\r\ntheory.\r\nHe further recognized that with a quarter of the\r\nworld’s population in declining growth, the United States,\r\nin Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan’s\r\nwords,\r\n“ cannot forever be an oasis of prosperity.\u0027 Growth\r\nat home depends upon growth abroad”.\r\nI have quoted the President of the United States at\r\nsuch length both because he is correct and because he is\r\nthe leader of the most powerful country in the world.\r\nAccordingly, we would like to believe that with the\r\nproblem facing all humanity, and especially the poor,\r\nhaving thus been recognized, courage will not desert the\r\npowerful when it comes to determining the correct course\r\nto be taken, and following this course, addressing the\r\nchallenge that has been identified.\r\nThe tragedy President Clinton describes goes far\r\nbeyond the sudden impoverishment of the middle class to\r\nwhich he correctly refers. Poverty has been and is the\r\ncondition of the daily existence of even larger numbers of\r\nordinary working people. Paradoxically, the challenge of\r\npoverty around the globe has been brought into sharp\r\nfocus by the destructive fast movements of currents of\r\nwealth from one part of the world to another.\r\nPut starkly, we have a situation in which the further\r\naccumulation of wealth, rather than contributing to the\r\nimprovement of the quality of life of all humanity, is\r\ngenerating poverty at a frighteningly accelerated pace.\r\nThe imperative to act on this urgent, life-and-death\r\nmatter can no longer be ignored. The central challenge to\r\nensure that the countries of the South gain access to the\r\nproductive resources that have accumulated within the\r\nworld economy should not be avoided by seeking to\r\napportion as much blame as possible to the poor.\r\nClearly, all relevant matters will have to be\r\naddressed, including such issues as greater inflows of\r\nlong-term capital; terms of trade; debt cancellation;\r\ntechnology transfers; human resource development; the\r\nemancipation of women and the development of the\r\nyoung; the elimination of poverty; the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic; environmental protection; and the strengthening\r\nof financial and other institutions relevant to sustained\r\neconomic growth and development.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nFortunately, it is no longer in dispute that serious work\r\nwill also have to be done to restructure the multilateral\r\nfinancial and economic institutions so that they address the\r\nproblems of the modern world economy and become\r\nresponsive to the urgent needs of the poor of the world.\r\nSimilarly, this very Organization, including its\r\nimportant Security Council, must itself go through its own\r\nprocess of reformation so that it serves the interests of the\r\npeoples of the world, in keeping with the purposes for\r\nwhich it was established.\r\nThe issues we have mentioned were discussed in a\r\ncomprehensive manner at the Twelfth Summit Conference\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement held in the city of Durban,\r\nSouth Africa, earlier this month.\r\nI am privileged to commend the decisions of that\r\nimportant meeting to the General Assembly and the United\r\nNations as a whole, including the Durban Declaration,\r\nwhich the Summit adopted unanimously. I am certain that\r\nthe decisions adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement will\r\ngreatly assist this Organization in its work and further\r\nenhance the contribution of the countries of the South to the\r\nsolution of the problems that face the nations of the world,\r\nboth rich and poor.\r\nThis is probably the last time I will have the honour\r\nto stand at this rostrum to address the General Assembly.\r\nBorn as the First World War came to a close, and departing\r\nfrom public life as the world marks half a century of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, I have reached that\r\npart of the long walk when the opportunity is granted, as it\r\nshould be to all men and women, to retire to some rest and\r\ntranquillity in the village of my birth.\r\nAs I sit in Qunu, my village, and grow as ancient as\r\nits hills, I will continue to entertain the hope that there has\r\nemerged a cadre of leaders in my own country and region,\r\non my continent and in the world, which will not allow that\r\nany should be denied their freedom, as we were; that any\r\nshould be turned into refugees, as we were; that any should\r\nbe condemned to go hungry, as we were; that any should\r\nbe stripped of their human dignity, as we were.\r\nI will continue to hope that Africa’s renaissance will\r\nstrike deep roots and blossom forever, without regard to the\r\nchanging seasons. Were all these hopes to translate into a\r\nrealizable dream and not a nightmare to torment the soul of\r\nthe aged, then will I, indeed, have peace and tranquillity.\r\nThen would history and the billions throughout the world\r\nproclaim that it was right that we dreamt and that we\r\ntoiled to give life to a workable dream.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of South Africa for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Blaise Compaoré, President of\r\nBurkina Faso\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nBurkina Faso.\r\nMr. Blaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso,\r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Blaise\r\nCompaoré, President of Burkina Faso, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Compaoré (interpretation from French):\r\nIt is not without some emotion that I appear before this\r\nAssembly both as Head of State of Burkina Faso and\r\ncurrent Chairman of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU), to extol, here in this sanctuary of nations, peace\r\nand harmony between human beings.\r\nTo promote peace and security for our era and for\r\nfuture generations is the objective of the nations of the\r\nworld gathered here. It is also the message which I bring\r\non behalf of Africa, being convinced that, armed with this\r\nimmense hope, the Organization for African Unity and\r\nthe United Nations, intimately linked, can make a reality\r\nof humanity’s legitimate aspiration to a better destiny.\r\nBut first, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, as\r\nwell as the other members of the Bureau, upon your\r\nelection and the confidence placed in you to bring the\r\nwork of this fifty-third session to a successful conclusion.\r\nI also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Udovenko, on\r\nthe energy with which he discharged his duties.\r\nMr. Secretary-General, I would like to address my\r\ncongratulations to you and your staff on the work you\r\nhave done in so little time and offer my encouragement\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nfor the battles still to be won. It is entirely to the credit of\r\nthe whole United Nations system that it carries the torch of\r\npeace higher every day.\r\nThe century which is drawing to its close will be\r\nremembered as one of great challenges. Seriously shaken by\r\nthe two world conflicts, it also mustered the necessary\r\nresources to sound the death knell of colonialism and\r\napartheid.\r\nThe liberation of colonized peoples and territories was\r\nhistorically necessary to ensure greater justice, tranquillity\r\nand well-being for our civilization, a civilization which\r\nfinally understood that its survival lay in the organization\r\nof a genuine collective security. But the cold war, which\r\nled to bipolar confrontation exacerbated by ideological\r\nantagonism, made this security illusory. International peace\r\nand security have not been consolidated with the end of the\r\ncold war. Conflicts and disturbances which no authority\r\ncould contain quickly followed. The resurgence of these\r\ncrises and the inadequacy of the solutions proposed to\r\nresolve them bring to mind the plight of the Danaïdes,\r\nthose mythological beings who were condemned to fill up\r\na bottomless barrel.\r\nThe international community’s failure to restore peace\r\nto Somalia and to prevent genocide in Rwanda will stand\r\nout in the history of the African continent. This failure has\r\nundoubtedly greatly contributed to awakening our somewhat\r\nlethargic consciences and forcing us to confront ourselves.\r\nIt has revealed to Africa, which may still have had its\r\ndoubts, the limitations of the United Nations.\r\nThe twentieth century thus ends with this\r\nacknowledgement, which, though shocking for more than\r\none reason to those still lulled by the illusions of an age-old\r\nhumanism, is at least realistic and belongs to the new era\r\nthat is beginning. It is an acknowledgment that the United\r\nNations, to which Africa has given so much, cannot do\r\neverything for the continent in its struggle to quell the\r\nnumerous hotbeds of tension and ensure its development.\r\nThe conclusion to be drawn from this fact is self-evident:\r\nAfrica must recognize this reality and come to terms with\r\nit.\r\nThe thirty-fourth Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity, held in\r\nOuagadougou on 8-10 June 1998, devoted the thrust of its\r\ndeliberations to this new reality, which challenges and\r\ncommands Africa to take control of its own destiny.\r\nAssessing the scope and importance of the\r\nresponsibilities this entails, and which are theirs to\r\nassume, the heads of States took the decision to affirm\r\ntheir common will to focus fully — more than in the\r\npast — on the prevention, management and resolution of\r\nAfrican conflicts. This commitment will certainly ensure\r\ngreater visibility both for the Organization of African\r\nUnity and for the continent’s various regional\r\norganizations in their search for peaceful solutions to\r\nthese conflicts.\r\nThough Africa’s experience in taking control of its\r\nown affairs is still quite recent, encouraging results have\r\nbeen recorded in the management and resolution of\r\ncertain conflicts, results which deserve to be saluted here.\r\nThe task, therefore, is not beyond the capacity of\r\nAfricans.\r\nIt is my ardent wish that this experience be extended\r\nto the whole continent, to the most ancient crises as well\r\nas the most recent. From north to south, from east to\r\nwest, Africa must henceforth more systematically involve\r\nitself in the management and settlement of conflicts\r\nwherever prevention was not enough, where it did not\r\nsucceed in guaranteeing peace.\r\nTo this end, initiatives to strengthen the continent’s\r\ncapacity to respond quickly to crises have been generated\r\nby Africans themselves. The advantage they have over all\r\nother initiatives is that they are African. In order to be\r\ndeveloped and implemented, they need the unequivocal\r\nsupport of the international community. Subregion by\r\nsubregion, they need to be developed, without exception\r\nand in harmony.\r\nPreventing, managing and resolving the conflicts in\r\nAfrica, whose number and complexity are increasingly\r\ndisturbing, requires solid and reliable mechanisms,\r\nappropriate to local conditions, mechanisms dedicated to\r\nthe cause of peace, without which Africa cannot\r\nundertake sustainable development.\r\nClearly, the world’s problems are immense, complex\r\nand alarming. The extreme difficulty of dealing with the\r\nestablishment of peace in isolation gives multilateral\r\ndiplomacy an ever-growing role in the resolution of\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe United Nations and regional organizations such\r\nas the Organization of African Unity can bring a great\r\ndeal to this task. The OAU, for example, possesses a\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nResolution. Created in Cairo in 1993, this Mechanism,\r\nwhose effectiveness and practicality we are working to\r\nensure, should to be the crucible in which a genuine\r\npreventive diplomacy can be forged.\r\nThat is all the more imperative since the consequences\r\nof conflicts, whether internal or international, are always\r\ndevastating.\r\nAt the institutional level, therefore, we are equipped to\r\nrespond to conflicts, and we also have the will to do so,\r\nfor, as I emphasized during the thirty-fourth OAU summit,\r\n“the issue of security and peace in Africa is primarily\r\nof concern to Africans. No mechanism has any chance\r\nof succeeding effectively over time if it is imposed\r\nfrom outside.”\r\nMr. Balestra (San Marino), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nOf course, external solidarity, if it is sincere, will\r\nalways be welcome, given that in such a complex and\r\nchanging field concerted and resolute action can only be\r\nbeneficial. I have already emphasized that the management\r\nof conflict situations often requires the deployment of a\r\nlevel of human, material and financial resources beyond the\r\ncapacities of our countries. Thus, international organizations\r\nshould continue to show solidarity and partnership with\r\nAfrica.\r\nI therefore call upon the United Nations, with its\r\nwealth of experience, to contribute not only to\r\nstrengthening structurally the Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution in Africa, but also\r\nto provide technical and logistical support, since in the end\r\nwe share the same ideal: assuring for our world the security\r\nand peace essential to its development and flourishing.\r\nIn this test of international solidarity, one thing is\r\ncertain: Africa must definitively and first of all rely upon\r\nitself. We Africans are aware that in order to be masters of\r\nour destiny we must forge it ourselves. In response to this\r\nimperative no sacrifice has been spared by any State of our\r\ncontinent to establish an internal climate that is conducive\r\nto growth and sustainable development. After the years of\r\nuncertainty and stagnation, Africa has entered a new era,\r\nmarked by clear economic recovery in the wake of bold\r\nreforms and characterized by greater austerity and\r\nrationality in the management of public and State affairs.\r\nThis movement towards transparency in management and\r\ngood governance has been accompanied by the\r\nestablishment of homogeneous subregions in which the\r\ncommon destiny of Africans is daily forged, thanks to the\r\nsustained harmony of our principles and policies of\r\nintegration, the ultimate objective of which is the\r\nestablishment of an African economic community in the\r\nfirst half of the twenty-first century.\r\nAt present Africa faces two challenges: peace and\r\npolitical stability on the one hand, and sustainable\r\ndevelopment on the other. In their struggle and daily\r\nefforts to emerge from underdevelopment, African\r\nGovernments and peoples are not alone. They know how\r\nto rely on the sincere support of their friends. This\r\nincludes the operational development system of the\r\nUnited Nations, which I should like to commend for its\r\ndedication to the uplifting struggle against poverty and\r\nother forms of deprivation that afflict African peoples.\r\nIt is therefore regrettable that the United Nations\r\nagencies that are at the heart of the struggle for human\r\nsecurity in Africa — such as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, to cite only two examples — are seeing\r\ntheir financial resources slowly dwindle while the mission\r\nentrusted to them calls for a redoubling of efforts and\r\nresources. That is why I call upon all to demonstrate their\r\ngoodwill by contributing to the operational development\r\nsystem of the United Nations the resources it needs in\r\norder to assist Africa in confronting the challenges of\r\npeace and development.\r\nThe same goes for the question of debt. It would be\r\ndesirable for the eligible countries to have their debt\r\nrescheduled at the same time as they are initiating\r\nreforms. It hardly needs recalling that debt is an\r\nunbearable burden for our still fragile economies.\r\nGlobalization offers us the means and advantages\r\nrequired to succeed in the boldest undertakings, provided\r\nthat we clearly define our objectives and involve our\r\npeoples in the challenge of propelling Africa along the\r\npath of progress. It is incontrovertible that globalization,\r\nwhich implies a spirit of partnership, limits the\r\nindependence and initiatives of States. But can humanity\r\ncontinue to flourish if the gap between rich and poor\r\nnations, between the affluent and the destitute within the\r\nsame nation, grows inexorably?\r\nThe time has therefore come to rethink seriously the\r\nresponsibility of international institutions in the regulation\r\nof the globalized economy in order to ensure a balance\r\nbetween economic growth and social prosperity. To do\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nthat, it is more than indispensable and more than timely to\r\nengage in a restructuring of the United Nations, and\r\nespecially of the Security Council, in order to make it a\r\ntrue instrument for the application of the principles of\r\njustice, equity and democracy.\r\nAfrica accounts for one third of the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. That is why it is unacceptable that, after\r\nmore than 50 years of our Organization’s existence, an\r\nentire continent — Africa — should be absent from the\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council, which,\r\nparadoxically, debates problems that are for the most part\r\nAfrican.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIf the United Nations were to apply the principle of\r\nequity, would the sanctions against the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya continue despite the opinion of the International\r\nCourt of Justice and, above all, despite the decisions and\r\nresolutions of heads of State in the Organization of African\r\nUnity, the League of Arab States, the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement calling\r\nfor those sanctions to be lifted? Today Security Council\r\nresolution 1192 (1998) has underscored the primacy of law\r\nfor resolving this dispute, and the majority of nations within\r\nour world Organization hope that conditions of transparency\r\nwill be met so that the trial can be concluded, in the\r\ninterest of the victims and the Libyan people.\r\nMoreover, Africa hopes that the Security Council will\r\ndispatch a mission of inquiry to the Sudan in the wake of\r\nthe bombing of the pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum.\r\nAfrica forcefully condemns terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations and calls upon our world Organization\r\nto create the necessary conditions for a frank debate of this\r\nissue and for strong and concerted action against this\r\nphenomenon, while keeping in mind that unresolved angers\r\nand frustrations born of economic or historical conditions\r\nrestrict our capability to act.\r\nIn the same vein, can the United Nations continue to\r\ndeny the legal and international reality of a State such as\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, whose 22 million women\r\nand men are excluded from making any contribution to the\r\nactivities of our Organization?\r\nI am among those who believe that Africa is on the\r\npath of hope. I remain convinced that the economic,\r\npolitical, cultural and social obstacles that confront Africa\r\ncall forcefully for its children to rediscover the road to\r\nunity that will allow them to take effective control of\r\ntheir destiny. Without union, Africa will remain on the\r\nperiphery of history. Common sense tells us that we\r\nAfricans must once and for all rid ourselves of that image\r\nof the outstretched hand that bedevils us and build the\r\ncovenants of friendship, dignity and pride that will confer\r\nso much solidarity and generosity. This quest for\r\nindependence does not deny the importance of solidarity\r\namong peoples. It means reaching a new understanding of\r\nhuman rights and the rights of peoples; it means taking on\r\nthe responsibility of knowing how to remain ourselves.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of Burkina Faso for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Blaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Julio María Sanguinetti, President of\r\nthe Eastern Republic of Uruguay\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Eastern Republic of Uruguay.\r\nMr. Julio María Sanguinetti, President of the\r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the special honour\r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the\r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay, His Excellency Mr. Julio\r\nMaría Sanguinetti, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Sanguinetti (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nUruguay comes to the Assembly today with happiness,\r\npride and even excitement at seeing you, Sir, a\r\ncountryman of ours, representing Uruguay, as President\r\nof the Assembly. Uruguay was a founding Member of the\r\nUnited Nations and has been one of the its most active\r\nparticipants ever since, in all its endeavours. It has even\r\ncontributed its best soldiers, who put their lives on the\r\nline every day in the difficult peacekeeping operations of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nOur country came to this Organization at the time of\r\nits founding with the hopes and dreams of a world that\r\nwas being rebuilt in order to usher in a time of peace,\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nprosperity and stability. It certainly did not come here with\r\nany dreams of power, which could have had no place in our\r\ncountry given its small land area and relatively small\r\neconomy. But we did harbour the dream that has inspired\r\nall our great statesmen — that of being a small, model\r\ncountry which in the past century made secular education\r\nuniversal, free and compulsory and built a State of well-\r\nbeing with a solid middle class as the foundation of its\r\npolitical democracy. Thus did our country feel that it was\r\na fundamental part of the democratic development of\r\nnations.\r\nUnfortunately, we were not exempt from the upheavals\r\nand consequences of the cold war. As the Assembly knows,\r\nthe cold war was bloody and fierce in Latin America. The\r\nhemispheres were locked in a state of conflict over\r\npositions: here guerrilla wars and there coups d’état, both\r\nmanifestations themselves as part of a hellish dialectic in\r\nwhich democracies were wounded and sometimes fell.\r\nThe last few years have shown Uruguay to be a\r\ncountry which is making strides in its economy and\r\nprosperity and which, as the recently published United\r\nNations Human Development Index states, is once again\r\nmaking progress. It ranks third among developing countries,\r\nand we can say that we have attained the best improvement\r\nin the hemisphere with regard to poverty indicators.\r\nHowever, we come to this session not only with the\r\nconcerns about its institutions and peace which always\r\npermeate the spirit of the Assembly; we come here also\r\nhaving seen the spectre of a crisis which began as an Asian\r\nfinancial crisis and which today is a global economic crisis\r\nthat touches all of us. This undoubtedly deserves particular\r\nconcern. When we see stock markets carried away by a\r\nmicroclimate of psychosis, and when we see so many\r\nirrational phenomena spread, we feel like Anatole France,\r\nwho saw life as a struggle among various forces, of which\r\nwe are not always able to know which is the strongest. At\r\ntimes it seems that science and intelligence predominate. At\r\nother times it seems that lunacy and fear prevail. This is\r\nalso part of this phenomenon that started as a financial\r\ncrisis and then became a very peculiar psychological\r\nphenomenon. The point is that, both as Latin Americans\r\nand as a member State of the international community, we\r\nmust once again face this situation.\r\nShakespeare, who is often quoted in connection with\r\nmajor tragedies, said that fate dealt the cards but we were\r\nthe players. That is our challenge today: how to play our\r\ncards in this crisis which could even affect not just finances\r\nand economies but also the democratic stability of our\r\ncountries, our social peace and the fundamental values\r\nwhich inspire us.\r\nIn the 1980s Latin America went through very\r\ndifficult economic years. This is referred to — mistakenly\r\nin my judgement — as the lost decade, for those were\r\nalso the years in which we consolidated the strongest\r\nprocess of democratization in our continent, which today\r\nallows it to have more democracies and freedoms than\r\never before. Countries which had never before known\r\ndemocracy are now building republics and institutions and\r\ndeveloping their societies.\r\nThe fact is that after that crisis our countries made\r\nenormous efforts at transformation. They lowered their\r\nrates of inflation, opened up their economies and began\r\nstrong processes of integration — in the Andean area, in\r\nMexico to the north and with us in the south, Argentina,\r\nBrazil and Uruguay, and now with Bolivia and Chile as\r\nassociate partners, to the south. All of this meant that we\r\nhad a Latin America which was growing again and which\r\nwould once again be a place for investments; a Latin\r\nAmerica which was able to harmonize the return of\r\ndemocracy and peace with economic growth.\r\nWe now find ourselves faced with the new crisis.\r\nWhat should we do? In our view, the first thing to do is\r\nto consolidate and support the Organization and the\r\ninternational community. We should do that here, in this\r\ninstitution, which is a hymn to internationalism, as well\r\nas in the economic area. The International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF), the World Bank and the Inter-American\r\nDevelopment Bank — which is the main source of\r\nfinancing for our hemisphere — are the tools we rely on\r\ntoday. We must strengthen them.\r\nIndeed, this crisis will leave behind consequences\r\nonce it is over. Somehow the debate that took place\r\nbetween Lord Keynes and Harry White, at the time of the\r\nestablishment of the International Monetary Fund at\r\nBretton Woods, hangs over the world today. The British\r\neconomist held the view that it was necessary to have a\r\ncentral bank of central banks. I shall not bring in that\r\ndebate here today, but I think that it will nevertheless\r\nhave to take place once the crucial moments of this crisis\r\nare over, because of the need for prevention and for a\r\nmarket economy which actually works.\r\nWe must all feel and know that the origins of this\r\ncrisis have been identified. First, there has been excessive\r\nspeculation, which has been clearly reflected in stock\r\nmarkets. It also stems from macroeconomic imbalances in\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nmany States, which have not been able to correct those\r\nimbalances, mainly their fiscal gaps, that have been\r\nfundamental causes of this situation.\r\nFortunately, the North American economy and the\r\nEuropean economy still appear to be solid. Japan is the\r\ncountry of which we are all hoping for a recovery so that\r\nthe measures under way today will allow us to view much\r\nmore calmly the future of this situation, which could very\r\nwell continue for a long time. As the Brazilian Foreign\r\nMinister said today, the magnitude and the duration of this\r\ncrisis are unpredictable, but what should not be\r\nunpredictable is the behaviour of States.\r\nTherefore, it is essential that we act to bring to an end\r\nthose financial imbalances and avoid the mistakes and\r\ntemptations related to such crises. First, we should not\r\nbelieve that by isolating ourselves in neo-protectionism we\r\nwill find a way out of the crisis.\r\nIn Latin America in the 1980s we had an external debt\r\ncrisis. There were those who advocated not repaying the\r\ndebt and returning in some way to more protected\r\neconomies. There were those of us, on the other hand, who\r\nthought that the debt should be refinanced and that we\r\nshould join the international community more actively and\r\nin that way grow again. Only by growing our economies\r\ncould the external debt be made manageable in the future.\r\nThe former, unfortunately, were not lucky and the latter,\r\nfortunately, were. In that way, we were able to refinance\r\nthe external debt and return to investment, and growth\r\nenabled us to pay off the debt effectively and thus achieve\r\nbetter living conditions for our peoples.\r\nTurmoil and speculation are not what are most needed\r\nfor the prosperity of needy peoples. To the contrary, profit-\r\nmaking opportunities for speculators come at the expense\r\nof the majority.\r\nThat is the path that we see clearly defined today for\r\nthis situation, and we must all redouble our efforts in that\r\ndirection. We will also have to strengthen anew the\r\ninternational financial community so that there can exist a\r\nreal international safety net that will allow us to work in\r\npeace.\r\nOf course, the leading economic countries have a great\r\nresponsibility. President Clinton said last week that this was\r\nthe most important economic and financial crisis of the\r\nsecond half of the century, and no doubt it is. That is all\r\nthe more reason for the major economies to assume their\r\nresponsibilities and for smaller economies, such as ours,\r\nwhich basically seeks more and more equitable living\r\nconditions, to try not to bring bad news to the world,\r\neven while lacking the capacity and opportunity to be\r\nthose who can offer the world good news.\r\nWe should thus protect ourselves from a dangerous\r\nneo-protectionism and continue to fight for increasingly\r\nopen and transparent markets, from which the persistent\r\nsubsidies in the large States disappear — subsidies in the\r\nUnited States and the European Community, agricultural\r\nsubsidies which undoubtedly are a troublesome factor in\r\ninternational economic activities and must be left behind.\r\nIf the crisis teaches us anything, it is that we must find\r\nbalance, and balance will not be found on the basis of\r\nsubsidies which continue to promote opportunity for\r\nartificial economic sectors.\r\nWe must also protect ourselves from messianic\r\ndemagoguery, which is the political dimension of this\r\ncrisis. For that reason, warding off and resolving the crisis\r\nthrough international cooperation and concrete measures\r\nare also very important in a democratic context. When\r\nsuch instabilities occur, messianic demagogues appear, all\r\nthose pyrotechnists of prosperity who have always led\r\npeoples to misfortune and to whom we should not offer,\r\nthrough instability, another opportunity.\r\nThis is therefore a financial and economic crisis, and\r\nultimately a crisis in political democracy. It is the\r\nfundamental chapter through which we must continue to\r\nwork here.\r\nOur world is living in disconcerting times. In 1989,\r\nit seemed, with the market economy triumphant over the\r\nsocialist economy and liberal democracy triumphant over\r\nthe Communist world, that we were entering an era of\r\npeace and stability in which the old Hegelian dialectics\r\nwould yield to a world of synthesis — what was termed\r\nthe end of history, what others called the pensée unique.\r\nUndoubtedly, that was an oversimplification.\r\nToday it would also be an oversimplification to\r\nbelieve that we have once again entered the crisis of\r\ncapitalism. In my long political career, I have been\r\ninvited many times to the funeral of capitalism. Times\r\nhave definitely shown that the market economy, with its\r\ndynamics and its spirit of initiative, once again recovered,\r\nand this will happen again now because no one is\r\npointing to a better alternative.\r\nTherefore, we must not fall into another\r\noversimplification. At one point we believed that the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nsimple freeing of markets would bring about the miraculous\r\nresult of achieving growth and equity; we cannot now\r\nreturn to the past and believe that through closed\r\neconomies, through stronger protectionist measures or even\r\nthrough authoritarianism we will be able to resolve a\r\nsituation that, now more than ever, must be addressed with\r\nthe guidance of democratic principles.\r\nNo one has a clear road map. Thus, there is all the\r\nmore reason to reaffirm the basic principles, the first one\r\nbeing political democracy, which calls on us, as President\r\nClinton said earlier, to fight against terrorism, which\r\nthrough violence attacks democracy, in all its forms, from\r\nthe outside; and to fight against the enemies which\r\ndemocracy generates from within. At times we have\r\nsuffered from excessive political passion, which sometimes\r\nleads to divisions within countries, intolerance, racial\r\nhatred, abuse of economic power and abuse of the media;\r\nall of these factors are part of a democracy, but when used\r\nwithout ethical limits they may weaken it.\r\nWe also have a right to ask the citizen to participate.\r\nIt is not through an alienated or indifferent citizenry that\r\ndemocracy will be strengthened. Democracy will be closely\r\nrelated to an efficient State, for only an efficient State can\r\nstand united if the objective is to improve the lives of our\r\npeople, only a State which is not a mechanism for waste,\r\nbut rather a strong instrument to promote the forces of\r\nsociety; to a market economy and increasingly open trade\r\nbased on standards that protect us from unfair competition;\r\nand to a process of integration such as those being carried\r\nout in the Latin American countries to enable us to join the\r\nworld with suitable economies to improve our production.\r\nWe must also think of the basic values of our\r\nsocieties, such as the family, which is the historic nucleus\r\nof our civilization. The weakening of the family has come\r\nat a high price. Today, the drug trade reflects the spiritual\r\nscourge of societies which, in their economic development,\r\nhave lost sight of spiritual values. Such societies have\r\nweakened the family in a world where images, emptiness\r\nand passing trends have caused a vacuum that in turn\r\ncauses the phenomenon of the search for artificial paradises\r\nthat aim to replace a meaningful life. We must enhance\r\nspiritual factors to give democracies genuine content.\r\nWe must, of course, be pragmatical in economic\r\nmatters, but pragmatism alone will not keep alive the hopes\r\nof peoples. We must strengthen family values, human\r\ndignity and the universality of human rights, as our friend\r\nPresident Mandela has said. We must all respect ethnic\r\nindividuality; in the final analysis we are all the same. We\r\nmust all fight against racial discrimination; we must all\r\nrespect and be very mindful of cultural diversity. But no\r\nethnic or cultural diversity can sanction the enslavement\r\nof women or the killing of men: we are speaking here of\r\nuniversal values that are essential to the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and that we must not only\r\nproclaim but must also practice.\r\nAs Toynbee said, “Civilization is a movement and\r\nnot a condition, a voyage and not a harbour” (Readers\r\nDigest, October 1958). We must therefore clearly identify\r\nthe stars that will guide us on that voyage. It is in those\r\nstars that Uruguay believes.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Julio María Sanguinetti, President of the\r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike\r\nKumaratunga, President of the Democratic Socialist\r\nRepublic of Sri Lanka\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of\r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\r\nMrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,\r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri\r\nLanka, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, President of\r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, and to\r\ninvite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kumaratunga: At the outset,\r\nMr. President, let me extend to you Sri Lanka’s warmest\r\ncongratulations on your well-deserved election. We wish\r\nyou well and have no doubt that you will guide the work\r\nof this session with wisdom, skill and commitment.\r\nThe Assembly owes a debt of gratitude to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko for his wise and\r\nastute leadership as President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-second session.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nThis year Sri Lanka celebrates the golden jubilee of its\r\nindependence. We reclaimed our freedom in 1948, ending\r\nnearly five centuries of colonial domination. We have given\r\nshelter within our land to all the great religions of the\r\nworld: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. We are\r\na multiethnic and multicultural society. We are deeply\r\ncommitted to the democratic way of life. Our people have\r\nexercised universal adult franchise since 1931. We have a\r\nparliamentary system of government, with elections held\r\nregularly, where voter participation is uniquely high — as\r\nmuch as 80 per cent on average. We have an independent\r\njudiciary and free media. The rule of law is observed and\r\nrespected. Fundamental rights are guaranteed and rendered\r\njusticiable. We are constantly alert to the protection of\r\nhuman rights, even in the face of grave provocation from\r\nsome lawless elements that are bent on destroying our\r\ndemocratic society.\r\nShortly after the achievement of its independence, Sri\r\nLanka became a member of the United Nations. In the\r\npreamble to the Charter, the founding fathers expressed\r\ntheir determination to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war. They reaffirmed their faith in fundamental\r\nhuman rights. They pledged to establish an environment in\r\nwhich international law and treaty obligations would be\r\nobserved, and to promote the economic and social progress\r\nof all peoples. The United Nations has succeeded in\r\nkeeping its basic promise of saving the world from the\r\nholocaust of a global conflict.\r\nBut more than 50 years after the Charter was written,\r\nwe cannot conclude that the world today is a safer place\r\nthan it was when the United Nations was founded. Global\r\nnuclear disarmament remains a distant dream. Nuclear\r\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction have proliferated\r\nwith no concern for the safety of humankind despite the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Members of\r\nthe nuclear club that possess these weapons show no\r\ninclination to dismantle them even though the cold war has\r\nended and conflicts between States have lessened. The\r\nUnited Nations has the responsibility to redouble its efforts\r\nto achieve global disarmament. That is a duty we owe to\r\nmankind, to unborn generations. We do not accept the\r\nthesis that these weapons are safe in the hands of some.\r\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has been\r\ndemanding for a long time that the Conference on\r\nDisarmament should establish, as its highest priority, a\r\ncommittee to commence negotiations on a programme for\r\nthe complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a time\r\nbound framework.\r\nIn 1976 my mother, Mrs. Sirimavo R. D.\r\nBandaranaike, addressing the Assembly as Prime Minister\r\nof Sri Lanka and chairperson of the Movement of Non-\r\nAligned Countries, spoke of disarmament in the following\r\nwords:\r\n“General and complete disarmament has been\r\na declared objective of the United Nations and of the\r\ninternational community for nearly three decades.\r\n“Despite many initiatives taken by this\r\nOrganization ... the world has witnessed not even the\r\nsemblance of disarmament but a race for supremacy\r\nin destructive power, based on the myth that peace\r\ncan be preserved only by strident and single-minded\r\npreparations for war and the refinement and\r\nsophistication of its techniques. It is, indeed, a sad\r\nreflection on the moral and intellectual standards of\r\nthe twentieth century and of its values and priorities\r\nthat so much of the world’s resources, which might\r\nhave been devoted to the eradication of poverty,\r\nignorance, disease and hunger, are being [wasted on]\r\nthe production of monstrous weapons ...\r\n“[We] do not accept the thesis that\r\ndisarmament is the special preserve of Powers that\r\npossess the paraphernalia of war. Every nation and\r\nevery individual has a right to peace, and just as\r\npeace is indivisible so is the responsibility for its\r\npreservation. Hence the call of the non-aligned\r\nnations for a special session of the General\r\nAssembly devoted to disarmament and agreement for\r\na world conference.” (A/31/PV.11, paras. 37-39)\r\nAt the recently concluded Non-Aligned Movement\r\nSummit, held in South Africa under the chairmanship of\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela, the Movement once again\r\nexpressed its preoccupation with the issue of global\r\nnuclear disarmament. In the years ahead the clamour for\r\ndisarmament among the great majority of nations will\r\ngrow in volume. The Non-Aligned Movement has\r\nconsistently called for the Geneva-based Conference on\r\nDisarmament to establish, as the highest priority, an ad\r\nhoc committee to commence negotiations on a programme\r\nfor the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a\r\ntime-bound framework. In addition, there is also a\r\nproposal for a nuclear weapons convention. We have to\r\naddress these challenges as we approach the new\r\nmillennium. The longer we shirk our responsibility, the\r\ngreater the danger that looms ahead.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nToday I have the honour and privilege of addressing\r\nthe Assembly as the newly appointed chairperson of the\r\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation\r\n(SAARC), which met in Colombo a few months ago.\r\nSAARC represents one fifth of humanity. South Asia is heir\r\nto a rich and complex plurality of cultural and religious\r\ntraditions of great antiquity.\r\nLike any other association of sovereign States, we\r\nhave our share of problems. But I wish to convey my\r\nconfident belief that our summit meetings last year and this\r\nyear have marked a turning point in the life of our\r\nassociation. Our leaders are aware of the awesome\r\nobligations that we jointly owe to the hundreds of millions\r\nof people who inhabit our region. We are determined to put\r\naside the political differences that bedevil relations among\r\nsome of us, in a common and united effort to improve the\r\nquality of life of our peoples.\r\nThe message I bring from the Colombo Summit is that\r\nthe prospects for enhanced economic, technological, social\r\nand scientific cooperation in our region are exceedingly\r\nbright. It is the will of our leaders, as vigorously manifested\r\nat the Colombo Summit. I am deeply indebted to my fellow\r\nHeads of State and Government for their invaluable advice\r\nand cooperation, and especially to the Prime Ministers of\r\nIndia and Pakistan for the magnificent spirit of friendship\r\nand understanding they showed for the collective regional\r\ninterests and concerns.\r\nSAARC too, like the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nrecognizes that the twin currents of globalization and\r\nliberalization which are swirling around us contain both the\r\npotential for prosperity as well as the seed of a dangerous\r\nnew process of uneven development. It must be\r\nremembered that developing countries need special\r\nconsideration in regard to the problems they face in\r\nglobalizing their economies.\r\nHowever, what is abundantly clear is that not a single\r\nState, not even the most powerful, can hope to remain\r\nimmune from economic disease and contagion. Ripples\r\nhave spread widely from the economic upheavals of East\r\nAsia and Russia. The maladies that spring from economic\r\nglobalization require remedies which are global in scope,\r\nremedies which must take account of the ailments of all\r\nStates and not be based solely on the prescriptions\r\nadvanced by those who may seem to be secure.\r\nUnited Nations bodies must play a critical role in all\r\nthis, particularly by facilitating and fostering international\r\ncooperation for equitable development that could resist the\r\neconomic contagion that now afflicts us. The international\r\nmonetary mechanism has proved desperately inadequate\r\nin handling the recent crises. We now have to think in\r\nterms of a new financial architecture to obtain radical\r\nreforms of the international monetary system. This should\r\naim at achieving a balance between the adjustments\r\ndemanded as against available financing.\r\nI wish to propose three areas of action that merit\r\nserious consideration: first, that a “lender of last resort”\r\nfacility must be formulated to meet the problems of\r\nvolatile capital movements; secondly, that effective\r\ninternational surveillance devices must be designed to\r\nanticipate problems before the demolition squads of\r\nspeculators move in; and thirdly, that the resumption of\r\nthe Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF) be a vital requirement of the proposed\r\nrestructuring. The major voting Powers of the IMF, as\r\nwell as the developing nations, will have to consider\r\nlarger allocations than are now contemplated. In the\r\nmeantime, we should beware of attempts to liberalize\r\ncapital accounts before the modernization of national\r\nfinancial structures and the reforms of the international\r\nmonetary system are in place.\r\nA constructive dialogue between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries must be pursued on the basis of\r\nmutual benefit and shared responsibilities. Closer\r\nconsultation should be promoted between groups like the\r\nGroup of 7, the G-77 and the G-15.\r\nInstitutions such as the World Trade Organization\r\nmust live up to their declared aims and genuinely\r\nfacilitate a transparent, rule-based trading system that\r\nwould permit stable growth. The United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\r\nshould not be neglected. It should be strengthened as the\r\nfocal point in the United Nations family for the integrated\r\nconsideration of issues of trade, finance, technology and\r\ninvestment.\r\nMore funds for development activity need to be\r\ndiverted from the United Nations administrative budget.\r\nThe United Nations Agenda for Development, which was\r\nlaunched with great expectations, seems to be losing\r\nmomentum. Its implementation should not be delayed.\r\nDevelopment is not merely a matter of economic\r\ngrowth and financial enrichment, to be measured in\r\nstatistics, which can sometimes be misleading and\r\nillusory. The totality of the human condition must be\r\nenhanced and improved. Our commitment and\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nresponsibility towards economic and social development\r\nshould not be minimized and made secondary to other\r\nissues which, though important, do not touch on the well-\r\nbeing of humanity. It is a grievous indictment on us that the\r\nage-old problems of grinding poverty and starvation still\r\nexist in today’s world. I appeal to the assembled nations not\r\nto allow ourselves to be beguiled or dazzled by the\r\nexplosion of exciting new technologies, the seductive\r\nblandishments of global trade and high finance to the extent\r\nthat the poor, the deprived, the desperate fall away from\r\nour agenda into the limbo of forgotten things. We must not\r\nforget that the least developed countries have special\r\nproblems that cry out for attention. We must strive\r\nmightily, relentlessly, to banish these problems in the next\r\ncentury.\r\nThe G-77 has proposed that a third world summit be\r\nheld in the year 2000 to mark the dawn of the new century.\r\nSri Lanka supports the proposal as an opportunity for\r\ndeveloping countries to chart their own agenda for\r\ndevelopment in the new era.\r\nThe countries of SAARC agreed at Colombo that to\r\ncomplement economic progress, a Social Charter should be\r\ndrawn up for the benefit of our peoples in South Asia. This\r\nwould focus on determining practical, basic norms in the\r\nareas of poverty eradication, the empowerment of women,\r\nthe mobilization of youth, the promotion of health and\r\nnutrition, and the protection of children.\r\nWe must make a special effort to dissipate the effects\r\nof the discriminatory, social and psychological perceptions\r\nthat affect the status of women. The SAARC heads of State\r\nor Government condemned violence against women as well\r\nas acts of discrimination and humiliation which further\r\ndepress the dignity of women. There was particular concern\r\nover the plight of women and girl children caught in\r\nsituations of armed conflict.\r\nIn Colombo, the SAARC States finalized the draft text\r\nof a regional convention on combating the crime of\r\ntrafficking in women and children for prostitution, which\r\nwill be signed at the next summit in Nepal. Within Sri\r\nLanka, my Government has adopted a national plan of\r\naction based on the relevant conclusions of the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women, held in Beijing, and on the\r\nspecifics of our own national situation. The Constitution of\r\nSri Lanka enshrines the fundamental right of equality\r\nbetween the sexes. We have ratified International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO) Conventions guaranteeing equal\r\nremuneration and other benefits to women. We have\r\nstrengthened legal provisions against harassment and\r\nsexual abuse of women.\r\nWith regard to children, my Government has\r\nrecently passed legislation to set up a National Child\r\nProtection Authority directly under my supervision. This\r\nAuthority deals with such issues as child employment, the\r\nsexual exploitation of children, education, health and the\r\nplight of children trapped in armed conflict. We have\r\nformulated a “Children’s Charter” and a National Plan of\r\nAction to provide for the safety and protection of our\r\nchildren. While we are conscious of the tragic incidence\r\nof child prostitution and pornography in our country, we\r\nhave also traced the insidious international linkages which\r\naggravate the problem further. We urge the international\r\ncommunity to tighten laws and enforcement mechanisms\r\nto ensure that those responsible for such heinous crimes\r\nwill not receive refuge anywhere.\r\nA particularly cruel offence against the innocence of\r\nchildren is their forced recruitment by a terrorist group in\r\nSri Lanka to serve as suicide killers in the name of a\r\ncause they are too young even to comprehend.\r\nThis is just one sordid aspect of the activities of a\r\nterrorist group known as the Tamil Tigers — or the\r\nLTTE. They seek to dismember Sri Lanka, with the\r\nobjective of creating in our land a monoethnic and racist\r\nentity — an objective totally unacceptable to the\r\noverwhelming majority in the country and even to the\r\nvery community whose cause the LTTE claims to\r\nrepresent.\r\nWe believe that ethnic grievances exist in Sri Lanka.\r\nI said so in my address to the nation at the fiftieth\r\nanniversary celebrations of our independence this year. I\r\nsaid that the golden jubilee of independence was an\r\noccasion for reflection, as well as the renewal of hopes\r\nand aspirations. It was an occasion to savour applause for\r\nour achievements and also to rue the consequences of\r\nfailure. I said:\r\n“We must also with humility examine our failures.\r\nWe have failed in the essential task of nation-\r\nbuilding. We have meandered and faltered along that\r\npath, whilst among our neighbours in Asia and in\r\nmany other countries, peoples of various racial,\r\nreligious and linguistic communities live in\r\nharmony. The causes of this failure will be judged\r\nby history. Others will apportion and assign blame.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\n“Let us, those of us who have undertaken the\r\nresponsibility to guide and govern the Nation, march\r\ntowards the future in unison, putting behind us mean\r\ndesires for petty personal or political gain. The\r\nNation’s need today is so great and urgent that it\r\npermits space only for largesse of heart and mind,\r\nwhich will supersede in the national interest all that is\r\nirrelevant and small.”\r\nMy Government is firmly committed to redressing\r\nethnic grievances peacefully through political discussion.\r\nWe have presented a comprehensive proposal for\r\naddressing the ethnic grievances through a wide devolution\r\nof political power. The vast majority of our people, of all\r\ncommunities, have welcomed these proposals. Only the\r\nLTTE chooses to prowl the path of violence, resorting to\r\nterror to achieve goals which it alone espouses. However,\r\nwe have kept the doors open to the LTTE to join other Sri\r\nLankans in negotiating a settlement of all outstanding ethnic\r\nissues if it eschews terrorism and its bloody call for a\r\nseparate State.\r\nThe LTTE claims to be a “liberation organization”\r\nwhile it murders hundreds upon hundreds of the Tamil\r\npeople it claims to liberate when they disagree with the\r\nLTTE’s terror politics. Several Tamil leaders of democratic\r\npolitical parties, including members of parliament and two\r\nmayors, as well as Tamil human rights activists, have been\r\nbrutally murdered by the LTTE. Its claim to be a\r\n“liberation organization” is negated by its unilateral resort\r\nto violence and its constant refusal to put its claims to the\r\ntrue test — that of participating in an open, democratic,\r\npeaceful process of consultation with the people.\r\nBy contrast, in Palestine, Chairman Arafat pursues\r\nwhat he calls “the peace of the brave”, confident not only\r\nof the justice of his cause, but also of the strength of\r\nsupport freely given by the Palestinian people to achieve\r\ntheir inalienable right in Palestine. During the SAARC\r\nsummit, we expressed growing concern at numerous\r\nsetbacks affecting the peace process in the Middle East,\r\nincluding illegal attempts to change the jurisdiction and the\r\nborders of Jerusalem.\r\nOver the past few years the Government of Sri Lanka\r\nhas in various international forums strongly advocated the\r\nneed for collective international action in order to overcome\r\nthe scourge of terrorism. Our reasoning has been that a\r\ngroup like the ruthless LTTE, which continues to frustrate\r\nevery effort at finding a negotiated political settlement to\r\nour ethnic problem, has found sustenance in the liberal\r\nasylum policies that prevail in some countries. This group,\r\nwhich recruits children as young as 10 years,\r\nindiscriminately targets innocent civilians, assassinates the\r\nelected representatives of the people, including Tamil\r\npolitical and human rights leaders, destroys places of\r\nreligious worship and assassinates foreign heads of\r\nGovernment on their soil, is permitted to operate freely in\r\nmany countries. It maintains an international network\r\nwhich engages in fund-raising, narcotics trafficking, trade\r\nin illicit arms, the smuggling of illegal immigrants and, in\r\nmore recent times, maritime and cyber-terrorism.\r\nAddressing the United Nations fiftieth anniversary\r\ncelebrations in New York three years ago, I observed:\r\n“Concerted international action is essential to combat\r\nterrorism and to compel the terrorists to renounce\r\nviolence and enter the democratic process.\r\nUnfortunately, effective action to that end has been\r\nfrustrated through sterile philosophical debate about\r\nthe nature of terrorism.” (A/50/PV.35, p. 9)\r\nI am happy to note that since then significant\r\nmeasures have been taken. The adoption of the United\r\nNations International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings earlier this year has been a\r\nconsiderable moral victory for the international\r\ncommunity in its fight against terrorism. Sri Lanka is\r\nhopeful that all States will speedily take steps to\r\nimplement the necessary domestic legislation, aimed at\r\ngiving effect to the commitments made in the Convention,\r\nto ensure that terrorists are neither provided safe haven\r\nnor permitted to raise funds within the borders of one\r\nState to sustain terrorist activities in another State.\r\nWhile we enact legislation, we must also be eternally\r\nvigilant to ensure that terrorists do not find loopholes in\r\nour laws to circumvent the emerging international\r\nconsensus against terrorism. We are particularly conscious\r\nof the capacity of terrorist groups to resort to the strategy\r\nof using front organizations for raising funds which end\r\nup in the LTTE war chest to contribute towards\r\nmurdering and brutalizing our people. Moral and legal\r\nsanctions against terrorists are not enough. Laws must be\r\neffectively implemented. Only by such concerted action\r\nshall we be able to ensure that terrorists are compelled to\r\nrenounce violence and enter the democratic process.\r\nHere I would like to thank India and the United\r\nStates of America, in particular, for having recognized\r\nand declared the LTTE to be the terrorist organization\r\nthat it is, as well as for encouraging my Government to\r\nsettle this problem by political means. I would like to add\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nhere that this is an internal problem that Sri Lanka is fully\r\nable and ready to resolve, with the full support of its\r\npeoples. We will not tolerate any outside interference, while\r\nwe appreciate all the support given us by our friends abroad\r\nin resolving this conflict.\r\nIf at this stage I mention Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi of\r\nMyanmar it is because I am personally aware of the\r\nloneliness, the anguish, the difficulties and dangers that a\r\nwoman leader faces in political life. The people of Sri\r\nLanka and the people of Myanmar and their Governments\r\nhave been friends over many centuries. Our peoples share\r\nan invaluable heritage — the timeless message of the\r\nBuddha, the enlightened one who taught the world the\r\nmeaning of compassion, tolerance and understanding. This\r\nmessage moves me to express the hope that political issues\r\nin Myanmar may be approached in a spirit of conciliation\r\nand tolerance.\r\nIn all this, a catalytic role can and must be played by\r\nthe United Nations system. The United Nations has passed\r\nits half-century mark. The Secretary-General has described\r\nthe United Nations as “a noble experiment in human\r\ncooperation”. Last year was designated the year of United\r\nNations reform, and we are happy that a major portion of\r\nthe reforms introduced have been implemented. Some\r\nothers require further study.\r\nWe are aware of the financial crisis the United Nations\r\nis facing due to the default of certain Member States in\r\npaying their contributions. We urge them to pay their dues\r\nfully, without conditions and on time.\r\nWe are disappointed that agreement has not been\r\nreached over the reconstitution of the Security Council to\r\nreflect better the generality of United Nations membership.\r\nThe Council should be more representative, and its\r\ndeliberations more transparent and democratic, thus\r\nresponding to the concerns of all and shedding its image,\r\nnot entirely inaccurate, of largely serving the interests of\r\nthe major Powers.\r\nIn the closing years of the present millennium, the\r\nworld is a far more complex place than it was when the\r\nUnited Nations Charter was adopted. The range and\r\nramifications of the issues with which the Organization\r\nmust contend have dramatically increased. Change in the\r\norientation of the United Nations must keep pace with new\r\nrealities. The Secretary-General’s Programme for Reform\r\nis a step in the right direction. Yet nothing will contribute\r\nmore to the success of the United Nations than the extent\r\nof Member States’ commitment to the Organization’s\r\ndecisions. The credibility and strength of those decisions\r\nwill itself depend on the transparency of the decision-\r\nmaking process and on how closely Member States\r\nidentify with those decisions. If the United Nations is to\r\ncontinue on its voyage into the twenty-first century with\r\nrenewed vigour, to achieve its objectives of peace,\r\nsecurity, economic development and social reform, all its\r\nMembers must be empowered to participate meaningfully\r\nand at every level of the decision-making process.\r\nTo this end, two important reforms must be placed\r\non our agenda. First, the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil so that it will more fully represent two thirds of\r\nthe world populace is an indispensable requirement. The\r\ndeveloping nations and the regions of the world in which\r\nthey predominate must have permanent representation on\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nSecondly, the crucial role of the General Assembly\r\nin the decision-making process of the United Nations\r\nmust be recognized and guaranteed. The United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly is the supreme parliament of mankind.\r\nToday the era of the cold war is over. Economic\r\nglobalization is breaking down national boundaries to an\r\nextent that would have been unimaginable a few decades\r\nago. The world is truly on the threshold of a new order\r\nwhich surely cannot be driven any more by the narrow\r\nnational concerns that have paralysed the imagination of\r\nmankind for so long. Never before in human history have\r\nwe been presented with the stupendous possibilities that\r\nsurround us today of breaking the mundane bonds that\r\nbind us to banality and triviality. When the unconquered,\r\nunconquerable spirit of mankind is allowed to soar to its\r\nfull potential we will achieve a world in which truth and\r\njustice prevail, a world which we can proudly bequeath to\r\nthe unborn generations of our peoples.\r\nPrime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, my late\r\nfather, addressing this Assembly at its eleventh session, in\r\n1956, spoke as follows:\r\n“In an Organization such as this, the service that a\r\ncountry can render ... is not to be measured alone by\r\nthe size of that country, its population, its power or\r\nits strength. This is an Organization which expresses\r\nitself most effectively by bringing to bear a certain\r\nmoral force — the collective moral force and\r\ndecency of human beings. That is a task in which\r\nthe weak as well as the strong can render a useful\r\nservice, and I give the Assembly the assurance, on\r\nbehalf of my country, that as far as we are\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nconcerned, every endeavour that we can make in all\r\nsincerity to assist in the achievements of those noble\r\nideals for which this Organization stands will always\r\nbe forthcoming in the fullest measure.” (A/PV.590,\r\npara. 42)\r\nAddressing this Assembly 42 years later, I make bold\r\nto say that Sri Lanka remains a loyal and dedicated\r\nMember of this Organization. We have made a contribution\r\nto the quality of its deliberations and to the implementation\r\nof its programmes. We are deeply committed to the\r\nprinciples of the Charter. We believe in the United Nations.\r\nWe want it to be a strong, principled and effective body,\r\nthe common inheritance of all mankind, not the preserve of\r\na few wealthy and powerful States, but the guardian of all,\r\nespecially the poor, the weak and the defenceless.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\r\nfor the statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,\r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri\r\nLanka, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Tony Blair, Prime Minister of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland.\r\nMr. Tony Blair, Prime Minister of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, His\r\nExcellency The Right Honourable Tony Blair, and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Blair (United Kingdom): Today’s world offers\r\none clear lesson: to survive and prosper, we have to work\r\ntogether better. That much is clear.\r\nWe share a global environment. We depend on each\r\nother for development and prosperity. Regional conflicts\r\naffect us all. Our peoples suffer together under the\r\nshadows of drugs and terrorism.\r\nWe can no longer separate what we want to achieve\r\nwithin our own borders from what we face across our\r\nborders. Rapid change of the sort we have seen recently\r\ncan inspire fear. But we must face and conquer that fear\r\ntogether.\r\nAnd if our finance, our trade, media,\r\ncommunications and even our culture are, day by day,\r\nmore and more transnational, it would be strange and\r\npotentially dangerous if our politics remained locked in\r\nthe old compartments built just after the Second World\r\nWar. If the challenge is international, then the response\r\nmust be international too. We must launch a new era of\r\ninternational partnership in which we modernize those\r\ninstitutions that allow us to cooperate and to work\r\ntogether.\r\nThe United Nations has a real record of\r\nachievement. That is true. But it is true also that it has\r\nhad its failures. It has stood by or intervened ineffectively\r\nwhen brutality was abroad. It has sometimes delivered\r\nwords when action was needed.\r\nBut the United Nations is no more than its Member\r\nStates. Its failures are our failures. The values of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter are as valid now as when they\r\nwere written. But we have to find new ways of applying\r\nthem.\r\nSo I believe in the United Nations, but I also believe\r\nit must modernize, and do so urgently. All parts of the\r\nUnited Nations need proper accountability to go with\r\nsecure funding, better management and more effective\r\ncoordination in all their activities.\r\nOur Secretary-General has given us a lead. But it is\r\nnow up to us, the Member States, to give him our full\r\nsupport. We must not allow reform in the United Nations\r\nto falter.\r\nAnd let me emphasize today that we need to\r\nstrengthen too the authority of the Security Council. This\r\nmeans broadening its composition: new permanent\r\nseats — for the developing world as well as for Germany\r\nand Japan. More non-permanent seats alone would be an\r\nunacceptable compromise. We have been talking about\r\nthis now for five years. It is time for decisions.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nWe face many challenges, but none more immediate\r\nthan the contagion of recession spreading from those\r\ncountries currently in difficulty to affect the wider world\r\neconomy. The solutions do not lie in misguided attempts to\r\nimpose new panoplies of controls on international capital\r\nmovements, or in a retreat from open trade. Rather, we\r\nmust all recognize that the absence of proper financial\r\nstructures and disciplines in individual countries, coupled\r\nwith a lack of transparency, will be punished by the\r\nmarkets sooner or later.\r\nHowever, we can act. We can devise new mechanisms\r\nto support a process of change: rules to encourage greater\r\ntransparency in international and national financial dealings;\r\nbetter supervision and regulation of financial operators;\r\nadequate resources for the international financial institutions\r\nto deal with short-term liquidity problems; structural reform\r\nprogrammes for countries in difficulty, programmes that\r\ntake account of the social effects of the restructuring we are\r\nasking for.\r\nThe only way to tackle such complex problems is a\r\nnew, high-level, international collaborative effort. Global\r\nproblems will require global solutions. As Chairman of the\r\nG-8, Britain will play our full part in ensuring the necessary\r\nlook at the international financial architecture and how it\r\ncan be improved for a new age. This is a priority, I believe,\r\nfor us all.\r\nHowever, we know that, unlike in the 1950s, this\r\ncannot be left simply to a few developed countries. Getting\r\nthe financial framework right is only a start. We must\r\ncreate the conditions for sustainable development in all our\r\ncountries.\r\nThe international community has set itself exacting\r\ntargets. Most important is the target to halve the proportion\r\nof people living in abject poverty by the year 2015. Our\r\nown development effort is now geared to the eradication of\r\npoverty. I told last year’s special session that we would\r\nreverse the decline in our development assistance. Recently\r\nwe have announced that we are raising our development\r\nbudget by £1.6 billion, and our support for health,\r\neducation and water projects in Africa by 50 per cent. We\r\nhave helped pay for the World Health Organization’s\r\ncampaign to roll back malaria. We are trying to put our\r\nmoney where our mouth is.\r\nOf course, however, these development programmes\r\nonly work if the conditions are right, and too much money\r\nhas been wasted over the years. That is again why the work\r\nthe United Nations is doing to create strong development\r\npartnerships is so important and must be given our full\r\nbacking. I call today on all parts of the United Nations\r\nsystem, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization, to give top priority to effective\r\ncoordination of their development efforts. The poor of\r\nthis world will otherwise be the losers.\r\nIf we want to eradicate poverty, we also need to\r\nensure that the least developed countries benefit from this\r\nglobal economy. That means, for example, letting them\r\nsell their goods without imposing tariffs on them. It\r\nmeans actively helping them benefit from globalization.\r\nAnd it means rejecting any false allure of protectionism.\r\nThe European Union is committed to zero tariffs for\r\nthese countries by the year 2000. And I would urge all\r\ndeveloped countries to follow suit.\r\nWe also have to ease the debt burden on the poorest\r\ncountries. Britain has proposed the Mauritius Mandate to\r\nspeed up assistance for those in the debt trap who are\r\ngenuinely ready to help themselves out of it. By the year\r\n2000 all qualifying highly indebted countries should have\r\nembarked on a systematic process of debt reduction, with\r\nthe aim of a permanent exit from their debt problems. But\r\nwe need to make sure it happens. Again, a huge\r\ncollaborative effort between the countries represented here\r\ntoday will be needed.\r\nDevelopment must not be at the expense of the\r\nenvironment. We all know this. But, again, this is a\r\nchallenge to us. The success of Kyoto was a close-run\r\nthing. Buenos Aires will be hard work, but it has to work.\r\nCountries with the biggest emissions must come forward\r\nquickly with credible plans to meet their Kyoto\r\ncommitments. We in Britain will shortly publish a\r\nconsultation paper on how we will meet our obligations.\r\nAnd I hope that others will come forward and do the\r\nsame.\r\nThe world has high expectations of the United\r\nNations as the guardian of global peace and security. The\r\nUnited Nations should not get involved if regional\r\norganizations are better able to tackle a local conflict. But\r\nsometimes we must demonstrate collective global will.\r\nAnd if we act, we must act decisively. Clear principles\r\nmust be our guiding hand. Let me set some out briefly.\r\nFirst, prevention is always better than cure. The\r\nresources spent on averting conflict are tiny compared to\r\nthe expense of peacekeeping once the guns start to fire.\r\nThe United Nations is building up its capacity in this\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\narea, but it needs more support — and again Britain\r\npledges to play its part.\r\nSecondly, where we do have to send in the Blue\r\nHelmets, they should be given a clear and achievable task.\r\nThere must be no repeat of Bosnia, where peacekeepers\r\nwere inserted into a live conflict and told to make safe\r\nareas safe. But they were not given the means to do so.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeepers need a way out as well\r\nas a way in. They must have the tools to do the job, and\r\nclear and effective command.\r\nThirdly, the United Nations needs to be able to act and\r\nrespond fast. Fast action can prevent a conflict escalating,\r\nunderpin a fragile truce, save lives. Again, we in Britain are\r\ntrying to play our part. The reshaping of Britain’s armed\r\nforces following our Strategic Defence Review is\r\ntransforming our ability to contribute to peacekeeping and\r\nhumanitarian operations: more and better equipped rapid-\r\nreaction forces, additional strategic lift and better logistics\r\ncapability.\r\nI can announce today that within six months we will\r\nconclude a specific agreement with the United Nations to\r\nensure that it can make rapid use of what we have to offer\r\nwhen it is needed — the first such agreement by a\r\npermanent member.\r\nFourthly, peacekeeping has to be accompanied from\r\nthe start by peace-building, to restore justice, democratic\r\ninstitutions, prosperity and human rights. The Security\r\nCouncil has to deal with the symptoms of conflict, not\r\nsimply with its causes. It needs to work with the rest of the\r\nUnited Nations, the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund if it is to have lasting impact. Again, I will\r\nbe asking the Secretary-General to put to us new proposals\r\ndealing with the consequences and the causes of conflict to\r\nmake this a reality.\r\nToo many of those conflicts sill abound. There are few\r\nhigher priorities than restoring peace to the Great Lakes\r\nregion. The Middle East peace process remains an apparent\r\ndeadlock. We have managed to make progress in Northern\r\nIreland, and the support of the world community in our\r\ndoing so has given us great strength and courage to carry\r\non. We owe a debt of gratitude for that support, and I hope\r\nthat the world will continue it. I believe now is the time for\r\na further move forward in the Middle East, too. Again, we\r\nin Britain are ready to play our part in bringing this about.\r\nI want to focus, however, on one other area of\r\nurgent concern: Kosovo. It almost defies belief that, yet\r\nagain, the security forces of President Milosević are\r\nignoring the clear will of the international community and\r\ninflicting brutality and repression on those they claim to\r\nsee as fellow citizens. Of course, we recognize that the\r\nunacceptable actions of the so-called Kosovo Liberation\r\nArmy have contributed to the present appalling situation.\r\nBut nothing can justify scorched-earth tactics and forcible\r\ncreation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.\r\nWe have some clear responsibilities in this situation\r\nas an international community. First, we must make it\r\nclear that our patience with broken promises — phoney\r\nassurances that are not honoured — is exhausted.\r\nContinuation of military repression will inevitably lead to\r\na new kind of response. Secondly, we must impress on\r\nboth sides the need to negotiate, with a realistic\r\nappreciation of what is possible, and point the way to a\r\nmutually acceptable solution. Thirdly, we must make it\r\nclear that we have to meet the immediate humanitarian\r\nneeds of the refugees in Kosovo and prevent, by any\r\nmeans necessary, the humanitarian disaster which we can\r\nsee just over the horizon as winter approaches.\r\nWe propose a new Security Council resolution\r\ncalling for an immediate ceasefire and demanding an\r\nurgent end to the trampling of the rights of the inhabitants\r\nof Kosovo. It should be adopted this week, and President\r\nMilosević would ignore such a resolution at his peril.\r\nThe international community faces another serious\r\nchallenge in Iraq. The Security Council is unanimous in\r\ninsisting that Iraq resume cooperation with the United\r\nNations, and Kofi Annan courageously reached an\r\nimportant agreement with the Iraqi leadership about the\r\nUnited Nations Special Commission earlier this year.\r\nAgain, this agreement has to be honoured, and we will\r\nplay our part in ensuring that it is.\r\nFinally, we face two global scourges which can\r\nundermine our institutions and, indeed, our way of life:\r\ndrugs and terrorism. We all know the growing links\r\nbetween drugs and crime and instability in so many\r\ncountries. The insidiously corrupting effect drugs have on\r\nall who come near them — growers, smugglers, pushers\r\nand users alike. We have, as we know, to tackle every\r\nlink of the drugs chain, but we are in danger of losing\r\nsight of the size of the mountain we have to climb. If we\r\nare honest with ourselves, this is a war that we are risking\r\nlosing, but we must win. Britain, again, is spending a\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 7th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nfurther £200 million at the national level on our priorities,\r\nbut our collective efforts need a much stronger focus.\r\nWe are not short of organizations looking at this\r\nproblem; indeed, there may well be too many. But we are\r\ndesperately short of results: cutting supply lines, eliminating\r\nillicit crop cultivation and stopping the profits of the drug\r\ndealers. We have a new instrument, the convention against\r\norganized crime. Too many countries still provide sanctuary\r\nfor the proceeds of crime. We must demand together that\r\nthose countries root out the traffickers and their dirty\r\nmoney — hit the drug barons where it hurts. The\r\nconvention will provide practical means to achieve this, but\r\nthe negotiations are dragging. Let us set ourselves the task\r\nof completing them by the millennium, at the latest.\r\nThe fight against terrorism has also taken on a new\r\nurgency. The past year’s global roll-call of terror includes\r\nLuxor, Dar-es-Salaam, Nairobi, Omagh and many others.\r\nEach one is a reminder that terrorism is a uniquely barbaric\r\nand cowardly crime. Each one is a reminder that terrorists\r\nare no respecters of borders. Each one is a reminder that\r\nterrorism should have no hiding place and no\r\nopportunity to raise funds, and that there should be no\r\nlet-up in our determination to bring its perpetrators\r\njustice. This applies to the new phenomenon of stateless\r\nterrorism as much as to its more familiar forms.\r\nAs a start, it is surely vital that all countries sign up\r\nto the 11 international conventions to ensure that terrorists\r\nhave no safe haven. We have ourselves, again, in Britain,\r\njust passed new legislation to ensure we can tackle\r\nterrorist conspiracies aimed at third countries. But we\r\nmust go further. We can hope to defeat terrorism only if\r\nwe all devote ourselves to doing so. So I welcome the\r\nrecent initiative by the President of France to tackle fund-\r\nraising for terrorism on an international basis. As\r\nChairman of the G-8, I again offer today to host a high-\r\nlevel conference in London this autumn to deny the\r\nterrorists this means of support. Effective new measures\r\non an agreed international basis could make a real\r\ndifference.\r\nI have covered many points in my speech to the\r\nAssembly, but my main point is really a very simple one.\r\nWe face multiple new challenges as we approach the new\r\ncentury. Our only hope, as we all know, of tackling these\r\nchallenges successfully is tackling them together. We\r\nneed effective international cooperation and modern\r\ninstitutions to deal with our political problems and our\r\neconomic problems. We need the United Nations system\r\npulling together as never before. We need to revitalize\r\nand modernize our international institutions to deal with\r\nthe crisis in the global economy. But, above all, we need\r\npolitical will and a sense of urgency. The problems of our\r\nmodern world are too pressing, their consequences too\r\nimmediate, their impact too far-reaching for us to hesitate\r\nor to look away any longer. We are being given a\r\nwarning to act, to give purpose and direction in resolving\r\nthese challenges we face together, or pay the price. And\r\nthe time to do it — to respond to that warning — is now.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Right Honourable Tony Blair, MP, Prime\r\nMinister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.50 p.m.\r\n31\r\n"
