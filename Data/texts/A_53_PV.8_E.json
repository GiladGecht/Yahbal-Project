(Uruguay)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mangoaela\r\n(Lesotho), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the\r\nRepublic of Latvia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear\r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Latvia.\r\nMr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of\r\nthe Republic of Latvia, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Ulmanis (spoke in Latvian; interpretation\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Allow me to congratulate the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly on his election and to\r\nwish him success in discharging his duties. I wish us all a\r\nconstructive fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn 1995, the United Nations system commemorated its\r\ngolden anniversary. This year, the United Nations celebrates\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This is a major\r\naccomplishment for humankind. The Declaration has\r\ninspired the development of a reliable and effective\r\ninternational system for the protection of human rights.\r\nAt the time of the adoption of the Universal\r\nDeclaration, Latvia was under Soviet occupation. The\r\nSoviet Union did not respect human rights, even though\r\nit participated in the preparation and adoption of the\r\nDeclaration. I will mention one example among many\r\nviolations of human rights: three and a half months after\r\nthe adoption of the Declaration, the people of Latvia,\r\nincluding myself, experienced the largest of several\r\ndeportations. Tens of thousands of people, even elderly\r\npeople and children, were deported to the gulag. This left\r\na lasting mark on the collective consciousness of the\r\npeople of Latvia and significantly altered the demographic\r\nsituation.\r\nDuring the period of occupation, the people of\r\nLatvia were unable to utilize fully the human-rights\r\nprotection system of the United Nations. That situation\r\nchanged as Latvia restored its independence. In the seven\r\nyears since Latvia became a Member of the United\r\nNations, it has benefitted from the moral and political\r\nsupport of the largest international organization.\r\nImmediately after the restoration of independence,\r\nour nation had to achieve the removal of a foreign\r\nmilitary force. This process was helped by two General\r\nAssembly resolutions and the good offices of the\r\nSecretary-General. I am pleased to announce that less\r\nthan a month ago the last military installation of the\r\nRussian Federation in Latvia — the early-warning radar\r\nstation in Skrunda — was closed. This event illustrates\r\nthat international institutions can constructively assist in\r\nthe fulfilment of bilateral agreements. Cooperation\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nbetween Latvia and the United Nations has been rich in\r\naccomplishments. The experience gained in the United\r\nNations community has helped us in our democratic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt present, Latvia is paying particular attention to\r\neconomic and social development. Latvia is experiencing\r\nhealthy economic growth at present. Latvia has one of the\r\nhighest rates of growth in gross national product and one of\r\nthe lowest rates of inflation among European Union\r\ncandidate States. It has a balanced budget, and expects to\r\nhave one next year also. This creates justifiable optimism\r\nthat the process of accession to the European Union will\r\ncontinue successfully.\r\nThe development of an integrated society is a national\r\npriority. This is a complicated task because the Soviet\r\nregime intentionally created a situation in which Latvians\r\nalmost became a minority in their own country.\r\nNevertheless, Latvia is dealing resolutely with this task. By\r\nthe end of the year the Government will have completed the\r\nelaboration of a programme for the integration of society.\r\nThis programme will stimulate the development of a civil\r\nsociety and provide more opportunities for the learning of\r\nthe Latvian language. When implemented, the programme\r\nwill permit all residents of Latvia to participate to an even\r\ngreater extent than at present in public and civic life.\r\nAlready Latvia ensures broad opportunities for the\r\ndevelopment of the culture of various ethnic groups and for\r\neducation in their mother tongues.\r\nThis past June, Latvia’s parliament adopted a far-\r\nreaching decision about changes in the citizenship law.\r\nMost of the major political forces support these changes in\r\nthe citizenship law. Shortly, the people of Latvia will voice\r\ntheir opinion of these changes in a referendum.\r\nCooperation with United Nations institutions,\r\nespecially the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), has enhanced the social and economic welfare of\r\nLatvia’s inhabitants. The UNDP has helped our country\r\nresolve sensitive and important issues of integration. On\r\nbehalf of the Government of Latvia, I would like to express\r\ngratitude for the assistance provided by the UNDP in\r\nenhancing the welfare of Latvia’s inhabitants. The\r\nsuccessful cooperation should continue.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights spurs a consideration of Latvia’s possible\r\ncontributions to the human-rights protection system. As a\r\nfirst-time member of the Commission on Human Rights\r\nbeginning next year, Latvia will support the promotion of\r\nhuman rights as a priority of the United Nations, and the\r\nOffice of High Commissioner for Human Rights as the\r\nprimary institution for that task. Latvia believes that the\r\npriority role of human rights requires increased funding.\r\nLatvia has decided to continue to support financially the\r\nproject for the development of national human rights\r\ninstitutions.\r\nOn the country level, I may note the National\r\nHuman Rights Office which has operated actively in our\r\ncountry for several years and which is the first institution\r\nof its kind in Central and Eastern Europe. The Office was\r\nestablished with the support of the United Nations. Latvia\r\ndesires to continue this constructive cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations. In support of the reform package\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General, the Government of\r\nLatvia will establish “United Nations House”. By the end\r\nof the year a building in Riga will be the home of five\r\ninstitutions of the United Nations system.\r\nIt is significant that during the golden anniversary of\r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration, the United\r\nNations diplomatic conference in Rome adopted a\r\ndecision to establish an international criminal court.\r\nLatvia supports the establishment of an effective court\r\nand hopes that an overwhelming majority of United\r\nNations Member States will do likewise.\r\nThe best protection for human rights is a world in\r\nwhich peace and security prevail. The bipolar order, with\r\nits characteristic threats to peace and security, is gone.\r\nHowever, the world is still unsafe. International terrorism\r\nand crime are growing, access to weapons of mass\r\ndestruction is growing, ethnic conflicts exist, and threats\r\nto the ecology of our planet are mounting.\r\nIn order to solve these problems, the enhanced\r\nparticipation of the United Nations, including the Security\r\nCouncil, is essential. To fulfil its role effectively, the\r\nSecurity Council must reflect the real balance of the\r\nworld’s economic and social power and use skilfully the\r\nresources available to it. Latvia reiterates its continued\r\nsupport for an expansion of the Council that would result\r\nin the equitable representation of small States and all\r\nregional groups.\r\nAs I speak from this rostrum, I appreciate the rare\r\nopportunity to address the shapers of world political\r\nopinion. We, the leaders of the United Nations Member\r\nStates, must realize clearly that the highest mission of the\r\nUnited Nations is service to humankind. The United\r\nNations should become a universal Organization. It will\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nretain credibility in the eyes of the world only if the results\r\nof its efforts are clearly evident.\r\nA prerequisite for this credibility is the ability to\r\ncondemn and deter those who have violated internationally\r\naccepted norms of behaviour. The United Nations has\r\nshown the ability to do this on many occasions. I believe\r\nthe time has come for world society to evaluate one of the\r\nmost inhumane regimes of this century — Soviet\r\ntotalitarianism. I take this opportunity to call upon\r\nvictimized peoples to commence a joint effort to evaluate\r\nits legacy. The people of Latvia have endured the horrors\r\nof Soviet and Nazi occupations and therefore have the right\r\nto appeal to world society to do everything in its ability to\r\navert the future appearance of similar scourges.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nWe live in an era when the human mind has created\r\nmuch that is useful for promoting mutual respect and\r\nunderstanding in our everyday lives. I hope that the results\r\nof the fifty-third session of the General Assembly will be\r\na lasting investment in shaping the United Nations for the\r\nnext millennium.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Guntis Ulmanis, President of the Republic of\r\nLatvia, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Seyed Mohammad Khatami, President\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran.\r\nMr. Seyed Mohammad Khatami, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations the President of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, His Excellency Mr. Seyed Mohammad\r\nKhatami, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Seyed Khatami (spoke in Persian;\r\ninterpretation furnished by the delegation): The light of\r\nhuman existence is kindled by man’s longing for\r\nsalvation. The essence of the message of divine prophets\r\nand the content of the teachings of prominent sages have\r\nbeen primarily aimed at human salvation. It is painful to\r\nobserve in the arena of human history the deprivation and\r\nabject misery of human beings; the deprivation of women,\r\nmen and children enslaved by the whims of the ruling\r\npowers; and the ill fate of rulers deprived of compassion\r\nand sympathy for their own nations. Hence, virtuous rule\r\nand good governance have been evanescent in human\r\nhistory.\r\nIronically, much too often will and freedom of\r\nthought have been frustrated and liberty suffocated in the\r\nname of salvation, and much too often salvation has been\r\nportrayed as disposing of any and all restraints on\r\ninsatiable human desires. Reason and love have thus been\r\nsacrificed at the altar of the whim. At times, liberty has\r\nbeen trampled in the name of justice, and at other times\r\njustice has been obliterated in the name of freedom. The\r\nresult has been humanity’s age-old deprivation from both\r\njustice in liberty and liberty in justice.\r\nIt is only a few centuries since genuine knowledge\r\nbegan to be construed as the source of power rather than\r\nan agent of its control. Ever since, knowledge, instead of\r\nserving human salvation and exalting human character,\r\nhas been used as an instrument in the hands of those\r\nwhose only object is to advance their own narrow,\r\nutilitarian self-interest.\r\nDespite its magnificent progress, humanity has\r\nsuffered massively over these centuries from\r\ndiscrimination and anguish. Survivors are still among us\r\nwho can testify to the incalculable destruction caused by\r\nthe two world wars, and despite the birth of the United\r\nNations — a positive achievement for mankind — true\r\npeace based on justice still remains a scarcity.\r\nParticularly desperate is the situation of the countries\r\nin the underdeveloped world, where so many still suffer\r\nfrom famine, illiteracy and disease, and some remain at\r\nthe mercy of rulers who do not even take the trouble of\r\npretending to respect democratic standards or enjoy\r\npopular support. So often they attempt to replace the\r\nabsence of popular support by dependence on power\r\nwhose sole purpose is the pursuit of domination and self-\r\ninterest.\r\nOppressive and dependent governments deny their\r\npeople the opportunity to experience democracy by\r\nperpetuating intimidation and terror in society, and they\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\npromote a culture of violence which inadvertently leads\r\ntheir opponents to resort to the same. The powers that breed\r\nand nurture such regimes can therefore not escape blame.\r\nPrimarily responsible here are those powers whose\r\nintelligence services take pride in their dark record of\r\noverthrowing popular governments and supporting\r\nunpopular ones.\r\nThis image of our world is indeed grim and repulsive.\r\nUntil the day that the wise and the learned wrest the reins\r\nof power from the unwise and the capricious, this image\r\ncannot at all be transformed.\r\nNonetheless, in my opinion, beyond the darkness and\r\ndoom, genuine beauty can still be discerned in the deeper\r\nlayers of history. I can assert with certitude that, on the\r\nwhole, human life has blossomed spiritually and materially.\r\nAnti-colonial struggles and independence movements of\r\nmany nations in this century exemplify this blossoming and\r\nprogress. The collapse of the bipolar world order in the\r\nfinal decade of this century and the swift march of the\r\nworld towards diversity, coupled with renewed assertion of\r\nidentity in the international arena by nations demanding\r\nequality, are other significant achievements in this direction.\r\nThe fantasy of a unipolar world ruled by a single\r\nsuper-Power is but an illusion, indicating the failure of its\r\nholders to keep pace with history. I am confident that\r\npowerful nations, such as the American people, will not\r\naccept that their good name, potential and national prestige\r\nbe exploited for the advancement of the dream of a\r\nunipolar world by the politicians, motivated by the short-\r\nsighted material and factional interests of a few. The\r\nevolution of public opinion in the West in support of\r\npeaceful relations on the basis of mutual respect testifies to\r\nthis assertion.\r\nNow allow me to speak here as a man from the East,\r\nthe origin of brilliant civilizations and the birthplace of\r\ndivine prophets — Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed,\r\npeace be upon them all. I come from the noble land of Iran,\r\nrepresenting a great and renowned nation famed for its\r\nancient civilization, as well as for its distinguished\r\ncontribution to the founding and expansion of the Islamic\r\ncivilization, a nation that has survived the strong winds of\r\ndespotism, reaction and submission, relying on its cultural\r\nand human wealth. It is a nation which pioneered in the\r\nEast the establishment of civil society and constitutional\r\ngovernment in the course of its contemporary history, even\r\nthough, as a result of foreign interference and domestic\r\ndeficiencies, at times it may have faltered in its course; a\r\nnation which has been at the forefront of the struggle for\r\nindependence and against colonialism, although its\r\nnational movement was subverted by a foreign-\r\norchestrated coup. And it is a nation which carries the\r\ntorch of its popular revolution, not won by force of arms\r\nor a coup, but by dethroning a regime of coup d’état\r\nthrough the power of the enlightened word. In the course\r\nof its new experience, our nation has endured eight years\r\nof an imposed war, pressure, sanctions and various unfair\r\naccusations. It has also fallen victim to terrorism, the\r\nominous phenomenon of the twentieth century.\r\nToday, the Iranian nation draws on its past to\r\ncontemplate a better future, while defying reactionary\r\ntendencies and, backed by principles and ideals rooted in\r\nits religious, national, historical and revolutionary heritage\r\nand benefiting from positive achievements of\r\ncontemporary civilization, marches, be it through trial and\r\nerror, towards a promising tomorrow.\r\nThe Islamic revolution of the Iranian people was a\r\nrevolt of reason against coercion and suppression.\r\nCertainly, a revolution which resorted to logic in the\r\nphase of destruction is much better disposed to resort to\r\ndialogue and reason in the phase of construction. Hence,\r\nit calls for a dialogue among civilizations and cultures\r\ninstead of a clash between them.\r\nFrom this rostrum and the pulpit of the United\r\nNations, I announce that humanity, despite all calamities\r\nand hardships, is heading towards emancipation and\r\nliberty. This is the unalterable divine providence and\r\nhuman destiny. The malice and depravity of no individual\r\ncan ever violate divine providence and the course of\r\nhistory.\r\nThe word “history” predates “philosophy”, and man\r\nis the pillar of history. History itself is the reflection of\r\nthe light of being upon various facets and dimensions of\r\nhuman existence. Thus, it is a unique and universal entity,\r\nalbeit diverse in nature. Whenever this unique entity takes\r\non a new guise, a new era is ushered in. Our assessment\r\nof history indeed emanates from our perception of\r\nhumanity — its pivot and pillar.\r\nHuman beings, who, in the Persian poet Saadi’s\r\neloquent description borrowed from a saying of the holy\r\nProphet of Islam, are various organs of the same body,\r\nare outside the reach of biology or psychology.\r\nUnderstanding human beings requires a philosophical and\r\nreflective view of man and history. God created man with\r\nHis own hand and in His own image, and He breathed\r\ninto him of His own spirit, and thus humanity is but a\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nsingle entity, and so is its history. The hand of God granted\r\nhumankind history, will and freedom of choice; the image\r\nof God provided him culture, spirituality and liberty; and\r\nthe spirit of God bestowed upon him life and vitality. Thus,\r\nhuman beings have come to possess history, culture and\r\nliberty.\r\nNot only do all human beings originate from one and\r\nthe same origin and share a continuous and integrated\r\nhistory, but also one may further postulate a single final\r\npurpose. This purpose of history is none other than spiritual\r\nculture, and genuine human liberty is its absolute\r\nprerequisite.\r\nWhether or not one subscribes to the view that man is\r\ndoomed to whirl in iterative historical cycles or to grapple\r\nwith historical moments or epochs, and whether or not one\r\nholds history to be self-driven, driven by human urges, by\r\nmodes of production or by superhuman heroes, everyone\r\ncan agree that it is only the ever-inspiring fountain of faith\r\nthat breaks every old and new shackle from humanity and\r\narrests the iterative eternal cycle, eventually emancipating\r\nhumankind from the bounds of historical determinism, just\r\nas it is only the vivifying breeze of liberty that can offer\r\nfaith and spirituality to humanity.\r\nIt is thus that humankind could, in consonance with\r\nthe mystic Persian poet Hafez, serenade that\r\n“I will subvert this high inverted vault if it should ere\r\nrotate \u0027gainst my dictate.”\r\nOr, in the words of the Gospel according to Saint Mark,\r\nif one had faith in God one could say to the mountain\r\n“Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea” (The\r\nHoly Bible, Mark 11:23)\r\nThrough such an understanding of freedom, the tenets\r\nof human dignity can be upheld in the face of political\r\ndomination and virtue, and hope against baneful blasts of\r\ndespair and nihilism. Here, one can discern the trajectory of\r\nhistory towards liberty.\r\nThe history of humankind is the history of liberty.\r\nOnly that interpretation which describes history as the arena\r\nfor manifestation of liberty can provide an opening of the\r\npast for the benefit of mankind. Regardless of all\r\nphilosophical systems that have attempted to attribute\r\nmeanings, directions and laws of evolution to history, we\r\ncan realize that because human history is intertwined with\r\nthe history of liberty, when human beings are liberated\r\nfrom imposed constraints of exploitation and social\r\nenslavement, as well as from unrefined animal instincts\r\nsuch as violence and savagery, they will then side with\r\ntruth and justice in line with their human nature. Thence,\r\nhuman history shall become the glorious history of truth\r\nand realization of justice. And this could be another\r\nexpression of the famous religious doctrine of\r\nMessianism.\r\nWhether we embark on an empirical and inductive\r\nstudy of history or an intuitive one, most thinkers would\r\nagree that the essence of humanity has flourished and that\r\nmore veils of ignorance have been removed from the\r\nminds of human beings.\r\nI have deliberately used the word “flourished”\r\ninstead of the more common terms, such as “historical\r\nprogress”, in order to emphasize that, whatever school of\r\nphilosophy of history we may follow, we can still share\r\nan understanding of this general and universal conception\r\nof history.\r\nThe establishment and continued functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations is a testament to the progressive path of\r\nthe world and of human history. Today it does not require\r\nmuch argument to establish that instead of war and\r\nbloodshed one could and indeed ought to resort to\r\ndiscourse and dialogue. That fact has not been achieved\r\neasily, as if the bloodstained history of humanity forms an\r\nantecedent to this seemingly simple proposition.\r\nYet so long as imprudent potentates can obliterate\r\nflowers and trees, hope and mirth from the face of the\r\nEarth with a quick stroke of their folly and cruelty, it is\r\npremature to celebrate the ultimate triumph of the Logos\r\nover the sword.\r\nThe twentieth century did not only witness the\r\nmanifestations of violence and human sufferings at the\r\nhands of old colonialists and the unprecedented injustice\r\nof their modern heirs; it was also the century of the rise\r\nand fall of totalitarian regimes. Let us hope that in the\r\ncoming century resort to force and violence shall not be\r\nglorified and that the essence of political power shall be\r\ncompassion and justice, externally manifested in dialogue\r\nbetween civilizations.\r\nThe question is how the United Nations may take\r\nthe necessary measures to respond to this evolving global\r\nclimate, and what impact it will have on the changing\r\ncourse of the life of mankind longing for salvation.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nI would like to propose, in the name of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, that the United Nations, as a first step,\r\ndesignate the year 2001 as the “Year of Dialogue Among\r\nCivilizations”, in the earnest hope that through such a\r\ndialogue the realization of universal justice and liberty may\r\nbe initiated.\r\nAmong the worthiest achievements of this century is\r\nthe acceptance of the necessity and significance of dialogue\r\nand the rejection of force, the promotion of understanding\r\nin the cultural, economic and political fields, and the\r\nstrengthening of the foundations of liberty, justice and\r\nhuman rights. The establishment and enhancement of\r\ncivility, whether at the national or international level, is\r\ncontingent upon dialogue among societies and civilizations\r\nrepresenting various views, inclinations and approaches. If\r\nhumanity, at the threshold of the new century and\r\nmillennium, devotes all its efforts to institutionalizing\r\ndialogue, replacing hostility and confrontation with\r\ndiscourse and understanding, it will leave an invaluable\r\nlegacy for the benefit of future generations.\r\nSimilarly, it is necessary that as members of the\r\nUnited Nations we revisit the history of the formation of\r\nthis Organization, with a view to reforming and improving\r\nthe institution through a rational exchange of views.\r\nThe United Nations took shape in a dark era of human\r\nhistory, when many of its current members were still\r\nexperiencing the bitter and abominable conditions of\r\ncolonial rule. As a consequence, the new Organization\r\nreflected the domination of the powerful few. Things have\r\nchanged now, and the opportunity has presented itself to\r\nrestructure this Organization, particularly its Security\r\nCouncil. Here I would like to refer to the wise statement of\r\nthe leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran in his inaugural\r\naddress to the Eighth Session of the Islamic Summit\r\nConference, held in Tehran, that the Islamic countries,\r\nrepresenting one billion and several hundred million people,\r\nshould acquire a permanent seat in the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council, with the same privileges as current\r\npermanent members, as long as they are enjoyed by those\r\nmembers.\r\nThe time has come to reject, through understanding,\r\nthe discriminatory veto privilege, and in so doing take\r\nanother step towards the recognition of fair and equal rights\r\nof all Member States.\r\nLet us all join hands in solidarity against genocide,\r\naggression and the humiliation of mankind in various\r\ncorners of the world. Let us prevent the continuation of\r\nshameful tragedies which have tarnished the face of this\r\ncentury in Palestine, Afghanistan and Kosovo, and in\r\nmany other parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\r\nPeace and security in the Middle East, imperative as\r\nthey are, will only be established through the recognition\r\nof the right of all Palestinians to exercise sovereignty over\r\ntheir ancestral homeland. The presently occupied Al-Quds\r\nal-Sharif ought to be the house of dialogue and\r\nunderstanding. Resonating from the depth of history, its\r\nvoice speaks intrinsically against racism and Zionism.\r\nGreat monotheistic religions can live peacefully together\r\nin Al-Quds al-Sharif, but it is the very Israeli rule that has\r\nmade such a coexistence impossible. Palestine is the\r\nhome of all Palestinians — Muslims, Christians and\r\nJews — and not a laboratory for the violent whims of\r\nZionists.\r\nIn Afghanistan, there is no military solution to that\r\ncountry’s predicament. The universal outrage at the\r\nmassacre and genocide being perpetrated there —\r\nparticularly the tragic killing of Iranian diplomats and a\r\njournalist, as well as at the continued captivity of the\r\nIranian aid workers in the hands of the Taliban — calls\r\nfor sober analysis and expeditious action to bring the\r\nperpetrators of these crimes to justice.\r\nAfghanistan, the land of people of dignity and\r\nculture, has now been turned into a haven for violence,\r\nterrorism and the production of and trafficking in\r\nnarcotics. The Afghan people, as other peoples in the\r\nworld, have the inalienable right to determine their own\r\ndestiny and the right to enjoy a broad-based Government\r\nrepresenting all ethnic groups, communities and\r\ntendencies in that country. This is the only way to restore\r\ntranquillity in Afghanistan. This requires resolute\r\ninternational cooperation in order to inhibit the lucrative\r\nand deadly business of producing and smuggling\r\nnarcotics, illicit trafficking in weapons and cultivation of\r\nterrorism. The United Nations, in cooperation with the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and all concerned\r\nStates, should bring all the parties to the conflict to the\r\nnegotiating table, paving the way for the tyrannized and\r\ndestitute Afghan people to freely determine their own\r\ndestiny and, backed by solemn global support, should\r\nbring the rogue elements into compliance with the will of\r\nthe international community. Simultaneously the\r\nOrganization should plan for the mobilization of requisite\r\ninternational assistance for the reconstruction of\r\nAfghanistan once the necessary political conditions are in\r\nplace.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nIn Kosovo, the legitimate rights of the embattled\r\npeople should be recognized, and the Yugoslav Government\r\nshould be made to respect these rights.\r\nHonest and sincere efforts to combat terrorism in all\r\nits forms and manifestations, including state terrorism,\r\nconstitute another important priority for the Government of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran. Terrorism is a product of\r\ndesperation and nihilism. In a world swirling in the orbit of\r\nviolence and oppression, serious combat against terrorism\r\nwill not advance beyond the realm of words and slogans.\r\nThe eradication of terrorism must be concurrent with a\r\nglobal search for justice.\r\nThis assertion should in no way be interpreted as a\r\njustification for any form of terrorism. As required by our\r\nreligious, moral and cultural values and norms, we\r\nunequivocally oppose all forms and manifestations of\r\nterrorism, and we shall combat it vigorously and earnestly.\r\nIn our view, in order to eradicate this menace, we should\r\nengage in serious and transparent international cooperation\r\nto combat terrorism, and at the same time redouble our\r\nefforts to attain the objective of global justice.\r\nAt the threshold of the third millennium, the world\r\nalso needs to be liberated from the nightmare of nuclear\r\nwar and weapons of mass destruction. Recent nuclear tests\r\nin our region, which have led to further complications,\r\nmake this all the more imperative. We should all realize\r\nthat the idea of attaining security through the acquisition of\r\nsuch armaments is nothing but an illusion.\r\nThe manifestation of a resolute global determination\r\nto eliminate all existing arsenals of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction within an agreed time-frame would provide a\r\nclear objective and lend credence and add dynamism to the\r\ninternational efforts against the production and proliferation\r\nof these deadly weapons. The establishment of zones free\r\nfrom weapons of mass destruction, particularly in the\r\nMiddle East, constitutes an appropriate first step in\r\nalleviating tension and mistrust emanating from these\r\nweapons. We in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as victims of\r\nthe use of weapons of mass destruction, are more cognizant\r\nthan anyone else of their horrifying impact. We shall thus\r\nstay at the forefront of international efforts to establish and\r\nstrengthen universal arrangements for their destruction.\r\nSecurity, development and prosperity in the third\r\nworld require the promotion of cooperation and the\r\nutilization of proven arrangements and mechanisms for\r\nconfidence-building. In this regard, it is encouraging that\r\nthe Eighth Islamic Summit Conference in Tehran, cognizant\r\nof this necessity, established an appropriate mechanism to\r\nfoster confidence through dialogue among Islamic\r\ncountries.\r\nAs a first step in this direction, I invite our\r\nneighbours in the Persian Gulf region, who have\r\nwitnessed two destructive wars in the span of one decade,\r\nto establish a security and cooperation system in the area.\r\nIn short, confidence and peace cannot be attained\r\nwithout a sober revision of the mentality of the cold war.\r\nThe advancement and promotion of a culture of peace is\r\ncontingent upon the recognition of the constructive role of\r\nnations coupled with avoidance of domination,\r\nunilateralism, confrontation and exclusion.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, in keeping with its\r\nfundamental beliefs and deep-rooted heritage of\r\ncivilization, seeks a world blessed with peace and\r\ntranquillity based on human dignity. It has accorded the\r\nhighest priority in its foreign policy to the removal of\r\ntension. In line with the principles of the Islamic\r\nrevolution, Iran is determined to follow its balanced\r\npolicy of expanding relations with its neighbours and\r\nother countries on the basis of respect for independence\r\nand equality of rights.\r\nComprehensive peace, over and above peace among\r\nhuman beings, also calls for peace between mankind and\r\nnature, which in turn requires that mankind bring to a halt\r\nthe systematic devouring of nature and instead emphasizes\r\nthe coordination of man and nature. The preservation of\r\nthe environment, as the common natural heritage of\r\nmankind, constitutes a most important priority of the\r\ncoming century.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to emphasize the\r\nparamount role of the family, women and youth in the\r\nmaking of a better tomorrow and the consolidation of the\r\nfoundations of civil society throughout the globe.\r\nThe family is the unique setting for human progress\r\nand the development of the personal and social identity of\r\nindividuals. Regrettably, today, especially in the\r\nindustrialized countries, the foundations of home and\r\nfamily have been undermined, threatening the emotional,\r\nmaterial and spiritual health of human life. A global effort\r\nis required to confront this danger, lest the flames of this\r\ncentre of warmth, affection and education be gradually\r\ndimmed by the cold and vicious winds of alluring\r\nfacades, lust and material gain.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nEfforts at the global level geared to the promotion and\r\nstrengthening of respect for women and their rights require\r\na critical reassessment of the traditional and inappropriate\r\nviews about women. The traditional outlook, based on the\r\nerroneous notion of the superiority of men over women,\r\ndoes injustice to men, women and humanity as a whole.\r\nEqually nefarious is the view that disregards the differences\r\nbetween men and women. We should recognize that both\r\nmen and women are valuable components of humanity who\r\nequally possess the potential for intellectual, social, cultural\r\nand political development, and that comprehensive and\r\nsustainable development is possible only through the active\r\nparticipation of both men and women in social life.\r\nAt the threshold of the new millennium, the United\r\nNations should have faith in the new generation, to whom\r\nthe next century belongs. It should thus be prepared to\r\naccept and embrace the requirements of believing in youth.\r\nLet us bring ourselves to accept that we are not custodians\r\nof youth and that the young do have the right to enjoy the\r\nsocial process of growth and development, a right they\r\nshould exercise consciously and wilfully. With such a new\r\nperspective, and drawing upon the dynamic ability and\r\nintellectual capability of the new generation, we can\r\ntogether chart a much better and brighter future for the next\r\ncentury.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Seyed Mohammad Khatami, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mexico, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Rosario Green.\r\nMrs. Green (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nThe election of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession is a source of pride for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean. I am personally familiar with the talent,\r\nexperience and diplomatic skill of Minister Opertti and I\r\nam convinced that these qualities will help to guide,\r\nmotivate and strengthen our work.\r\nMy delegation would also like to express its\r\nappreciation to Hennadiy Udovenko for the outstanding\r\nwork that he accomplished as President at the session that\r\njust closed.\r\nLast July, we had the honour of welcoming our\r\nSecretary-General to Mexico. On that occasion we\r\nobserved anew his firm and resolute commitment to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations, adapting it to confront the\r\nchallenges of the end of the century. We recognize in\r\nKofi Annan a man with a clear vision of the future of the\r\nOrganization, and we are confident that he will know how\r\nto guide it in this transition stage towards a new\r\nmillennium.\r\nMexico is a country with a profound multilateral\r\ncalling. Our desire to seek international agreement finds\r\nfertile ground for development in this forum. It is for this\r\nreason that we are convinced of the urgent need to\r\nstrengthen it and to seek within it shared answers to the\r\nchallenges that the new global agenda presents.\r\nMexico’s commitment to the United Nations does\r\nnot consist of words alone. A week ago, the Government\r\nof President Ernesto Zedillo reconfirmed this by sending\r\nthe International Convention on the Protection of the\r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their\r\nFamilies to the Mexican Senate for approval. From the\r\nvery beginning of negotiations on that Convention, over\r\nwhich Mexico had the honour of presiding, we insisted on\r\nthe importance of having legal instruments to ensure\r\nrespect for and protection of the rights of migrant\r\nworkers. By taking that step, Mexico is showing its\r\nunswerving commitment to the norms of international law\r\nand is making progress in consolidating itself as a State\r\nof law.\r\nConvinced of the need to strengthen the international\r\nsystem that makes it possible for us to have the will and\r\nthe necessary instruments to confront together the\r\nchallenges of the end of the century, President Zedillo\r\npromoted the convening of the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the problem of drugs. As of\r\nthat meeting, principles of responsibility shared among\r\nStates and of strict respect for sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nStates replaced the scenario of mutual recrimination and\r\nunilateral evaluations. We now have the bases for a global\r\nconsensus regarding the policies that must be adopted by\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nStates in order to consolidate an unprecedented effort at\r\ncooperation based on this new global, integral and balanced\r\nstrategy. Mexico will not regress in its efforts to implement\r\nthe commitments that we adopted last June.\r\nThe international agenda today, as reflected in the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly, is very broad and\r\ncomplex. I would like to refer on this occasion to only\r\nthree questions which I consider to be of particular\r\nrelevance: disarmament, which has been a constant issue in\r\nMexico’s foreign policy; the reform of our Organization,\r\nwhich will help to shape the community of nations in the\r\nnext century; and the international financial crisis, which\r\ngreatly jeopardizes the efforts of our countries to attain full\r\ndevelopment, as well as our ability to advance towards the\r\nfuture.\r\nAs far as the subject of disarmament is concerned,\r\nthere is no doubt that the existence of nuclear arsenals\r\nremains one of the central problems in international\r\nrelations. The threat of an atomic conflagration cannot be\r\ndisregarded, and we must reiterate our commitment to\r\nfashioning a world which is free of nuclear weapons. For\r\nMexico, the objective of eliminating these instruments of\r\nmass destruction is realistic and viable. It is time to set\r\naside arguments that, for strategic reasons, have served to\r\nconceal the efforts of those who either do not want to give\r\nup their present nuclear capacity or else want to join the\r\ngroup of countries that possess this destructive ability. One\r\ncan contribute to nuclear disarmament only by eliminating\r\nnuclear weapons. This is why we seek to broaden and\r\nstrengthen international commitments in this respect. Our\r\npolitical conviction is that we must achieve new agreements\r\nthat remove this scourge from humankind.\r\nMexico condemns all nuclear testing from principle\r\nand out of conviction. We affirmed this recently in the light\r\nof the tests conducted by India and Pakistan. Far from\r\ncontributing to stability and regional balance, such actions\r\npromote the proliferation of uncertainty and fear. They also\r\ncontribute to a climate conducive to the nuclear arms race.\r\nI would like on this occasion to reiterate Mexico’s\r\nconviction that dialogue and negotiation are and will remain\r\nthe irreplaceable means of resolving disputes. It was in that\r\nspirit that last 9 July we supported a ministerial statement\r\nthat sought to define a new agenda for the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. We co-sponsors of that\r\ndeclaration introduced a draft resolution that we hope will\r\nreceive the resolute support of Member States so that we\r\ncan in that way demonstrate the resolve of the community\r\nof nations to move towards a world free of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nWe are also committed to a new, integral approach\r\nto the subject of disarmament and the prohibition of\r\nweapons of mass destruction or weapons with excessively\r\ncruel and inhuman effects. There has been progress\r\nrecently in the Conference on Disarmament related to\r\nsecurity guarantees and the prohibition on the production\r\nof fissionable materials destined to be used for such\r\nweapons.\r\nWe are likewise pleased at the growing support\r\nbeing given to the treaties on anti-personnel landmines\r\nand on chemical and bacteriological weapons. In\r\nparticular, we are gratified at the entry into force on\r\n1 March 1999 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Once again we\r\nurge the countries that have not yet done so to ratify as\r\nsoon as possible these conventions that seek to eliminate\r\nsuch weapons from the face of the Earth.\r\nThe proliferation of small arms and its link with\r\ncriminal organizations and drug-trafficking constitute a\r\nsignificant challenge to the majority of nations.\r\nCombating this is a priority of the Government of\r\nMexico. The Inter-American Convention against the Illicit\r\nManufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms,\r\nAmmunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials,\r\nwhich was the result of a Mexican initiative, is of crucial\r\nimportance and should therefore be taken into account in\r\nfurther negotiations on transnational crime.\r\nIn the present situation, which demands that we\r\nclearly define the framework for international relations\r\nand adapt it in a timely way, the initiatives for reforming\r\nour Organization presented by the Secretary-General\r\nacquire special significance. The United Nations must\r\nreform itself if it is to remain a central force in our\r\ncollective lives.\r\nWe must recognize that traditional mechanisms for\r\nharmonization and negotiation are showing clear signs of\r\nexhaustion. We must rethink these strategies in order to\r\ndeal with old and new problems. The consolidation of a\r\nstructure which is truly democratic, transparent and well\r\nbalanced, and which is consistent with the purpose and\r\nprinciples of the San Francisco Charter must be our\r\ncommon goal.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nIn this context, I wish to stress the importance of\r\nachieving a better balance between the principal organs of\r\nthe United Nations. The Security Council needs to be\r\nreformed in order to strengthen its legitimacy,\r\nrepresentativeness, effectiveness, democracy and\r\ntransparency. In considering its structure, we must correct\r\nthe deficiencies in its present composition. It is not a matter\r\nof size; rather, the problem is the lack of balance in its\r\nrepresentativeness. The Security Council must reflect the\r\nplurality and diversity of the membership of the United\r\nNations, taking into account the profound changes in\r\npolitical geography experienced in the last decade.\r\nLikewise, we must avoid repeating or even broadening\r\nexisting inequalities. For this reason, Mexico is against\r\nincreasing the number of permanent members. Let us not\r\nfall into the fallacy of believing that the Council’s\r\neffectiveness resides in the right of veto. All rights bear\r\nresponsibilities and these must not be abused. Otherwise,\r\nthe necessary legitimacy which makes the Security Council\r\nefficient and effective is eroded. This is why I wish to\r\nreiterate our appeal to the permanent members to join in an\r\nopen-minded way in designing a system to regulate the\r\nsphere of application of that privilege.\r\nNonetheless, we recognize that structural reform of the\r\nSecurity Council will not in itself guarantee its\r\neffectiveness. Hence, we insist on the need to progress\r\ntowards a thorough revision of its working methods and of\r\nthe decision-making process. The community of nations has\r\ngiven that organ the high responsibility of ensuring\r\ninternational peace and security. Under paragraph 1 of\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, the members of the Organization\r\nrecognize that the Council acts in our name in carrying out\r\nthese functions.\r\nIt is therefore clear that the Security Council’s attitude\r\nmust be profoundly democratic and one of respect towards\r\nthe General Assembly, in accordance with paragraph 3 of\r\nthe same Article. Anything else would be a violation of the\r\nletter and spirit of the Charter, and would mean an erosion\r\nof the Council’s legitimacy and its capacity to fulfil the\r\nresponsibilities that we have entrusted to it. We must break\r\nthis vicious circle and make serious progress in the design\r\nand implementation of the needed reforms.\r\nMy country will continue to participate actively in the\r\nWorking Group charged with reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We hope to be able to submit to the Assembly\r\nrecommendations that can receive widespread support,\r\ngenuinely reflecting the collective aspirations of all the\r\nmembers of the United Nations.\r\nOur concerns about international security and the\r\ncapacity of our multilateral forums to respond effectively\r\nto new challenges are compounded today by the\r\nuncertainty caused by the international financial crisis.\r\nIt is obvious that the Bretton Woods system has\r\nshown its inability to respond adequately to the challenges\r\nof the current international financial crisis. We are\r\nundoubtedly faced with a situation of high risk which\r\nthreatens to erode the important development attainments\r\nof our emerging economies. Given the vicissitudes of the\r\ninternational financial situation, we, the countries of Latin\r\nAmerica, have endeavoured to maintain our economic\r\nstrength through profound and sometimes difficult\r\nprocesses of structural reform. We reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to continue to manage in a responsible way\r\nthe economic policy mechanisms that ensure our stability\r\nand growth.\r\nIt is clear that this is not enough and that concerted\r\naction is needed on the part of all countries and\r\ninternational financial organs. Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Rio Group meeting in Panama on\r\n4-5 September urged the countries in which the financial\r\ncrisis originated to adopt the measures needed to correct\r\ntheir imbalances. They made an appeal to the countries of\r\nthe Group of 7 to immediately take the necessary\r\nmeasures to restore stability to financial markets and to\r\nensure the growth of the world economy. The Rio Group\r\nalso appealed to international financial institutions to be\r\ninvolved more quickly and effectively in finding solutions\r\nto the international financial crisis.\r\nOvercoming the present situation must be our\r\npriority. We must be creative in order to find formulas\r\nthat make it possible for us to avoid recurring financial\r\ncrises and banish the spectre of global recession. Just as\r\nthe community of nations has recognized the wisdom of\r\npreventive action to protect international peace and\r\nsecurity, it is now necessary to take that same course in\r\norder to prevent cracks in the fabric of the world\r\neconomy.\r\nWe must consider ways of implementing an early\r\nwarning system that will allow us to detect financial\r\ncrises in time and thus avoid their harmful effects. In the\r\nrecent past, there have been warning signs which in\r\nisolation were not identified as a prelude to more serious\r\nproblems. We must collect such experiences, learn from\r\nthem and prepare ourselves better for the future.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nNo country is free from responsibilities, just as no\r\ncountry is free of the effects of international financial\r\nimbalances. It is therefore up to us together and with a\r\nclear sense of direction to seek the proper mechanisms to\r\nrespond early to signs that larger problems are imminent. In\r\nthis universal forum, I reiterate our conviction that we must\r\nact resolutely in the short term. We need to define an\r\nagenda for international economic stability. We appeal to\r\nthe Secretary-General so that, under his leadership and\r\nguidance, we can share experiences and proposals that will\r\nhelp us work toward global financial security.\r\nBy attaining that goal of preventive diplomacy, we\r\nwill be contributing to the development and well-being of\r\nmillions of persons who are victims of the financial\r\nuncertainty that today afflicts all economies, particularly\r\nthose of a relatively lower level of development, and\r\nendangers the stability of all nations.\r\nIn the face of an uncertain political and economic\r\npanorama, the role of the United Nations takes on new\r\nrelevance. Recent changes on the international scene yield\r\nunprecedented opportunities but at the same time present\r\nchallenges for which there are no easy answers. We must\r\nact together in order to encourage the necessary consensus\r\nas that will allow us to take advantage of the benefits of\r\nglobalization and confront its challenges.\r\nWe must fortify our individual and collective capacity\r\nin order to take advantage of the positive trends towards\r\npeace, stability, development and respect for law. Likewise,\r\nwe must strengthen our ability to banish confrontation,\r\nviolence, terror and inequality.\r\nThe United Nations is the necessary forum for facing\r\ninternational problems and finding solutions to them. As we\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the purposes of the San\r\nFrancisco Charter, we shall continue to promote the\r\nparticipation of the United Nations in the definition of the\r\nparameters of international coexistence.\r\nAddress by The Honourable William Skate, Prime\r\nMinister of Papua New Guinea\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nof Papua New Guinea.\r\nThe Honourable William Skate, Prime Minister of\r\nPapua New Guinea, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of Papua\r\nNew Guinea, His Excellency The Honourable William\r\nSkate, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Skate (Papua New Guinea): On behalf of the\r\npeople and the Government of Papua New Guinea, I wish\r\nto join previous speakers in congratulating you,\r\nMr. President, on your election to your important post.\r\nYour unanimous election as President of the General\r\nAssembly shows the esteem in which the international\r\ncommunity holds both you, personally, and your country,\r\nUruguay. The Papua New Guinea delegation is confident\r\nthat you will guide this fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly to a successful conclusion.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity, through you, to\r\nexpress my delegation’s sincere appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine,\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his outstanding stewardship\r\nin facilitating the work of the fifty-second session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe would also like to place on record our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General and the Secretariat\r\nstaff for the care they put into the planning of the affairs\r\nof our Organization.\r\nThis is the first occasion on which I have addressed\r\nthe General Assembly. The year since I was elected\r\nPrime Minister has been a year of great challenge in\r\nwhich my Government has been confronted with\r\nproblems associated with natural disasters and those that\r\nhave resulted from many years of neglect.\r\nThe realities of life in the rapidly shrinking world\r\nmean that a partnership must, in practice, be turned into\r\nsomething practical and viewed in a much broader global\r\nperspective as an element of a worldwide partnership in\r\nmanaging and, where possible, directing change.\r\nThe point is brought home by a series of natural\r\ndisasters which have affected Papua New Guinea over the\r\npast year. First came the drought caused by the El Niño\r\neffect, and then followed frosts, which led to severe food\r\nshortages in many different parts of the country. Then\r\ncame the tsunami which completely destroyed villages in\r\nthe Aitape area of the Sandaun province on the north\r\ncoast of the mainland, killing more than 2,100 people,\r\nmainly children and women, and injuring many more. In\r\nbetween came floods and landslides, which caused death\r\nand destruction in several places. Meanwhile, people\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\naround Rabaul continue to cope with the effects and try to\r\nrebuild in the aftermath of the 1994 volcanic eruptions.\r\nThe drought, in particular, showed that people and\r\nStates throughout the world have to be partners in dealing\r\nwith the causes of disasters arising from climatic or other\r\nforms of environmental change. The prompt and generous\r\nresponse to the series of natural disasters by our neighbours\r\nand friends in many different countries showed that they\r\nare truly our partners in dealing with the effects of such\r\nchanges.\r\nLike other developing countries, Papua New Guinea\r\nfaces the challenge of providing its people with\r\nopportunities to improve both the material standard of\r\nliving and the quality of life. My Government has had to\r\naddress these multiple changes while dealing with natural\r\ndisasters and carrying out a comprehensive programme of\r\nstructural adjustment.\r\nIn doing so, we are working hard to make sure that\r\nprivate initiative contributes to public welfare and national\r\ndevelopment, as it can and should, by focusing on trimming\r\nthe public sector so that State resources are used where\r\nthey can be most effective.\r\nThe result has been a stable economy with continuing\r\neconomic growth. It has been achieved and is being\r\nmaintained despite the negative impact on trade and\r\ninvestment prospects arising from the economic crisis\r\naffecting so many of our East Asian neighbours.\r\nThe lesson we draw from the experience is that the\r\nworld is truly becoming a global community. The challenge\r\nwe face is to develop a global partnership — strong,\r\nfocused, and determined enough to manage and, where\r\npossible, to direct change. The lesson has obvious\r\nimplications for a world in which some countries\r\nexperience “aid fatigue”, while increasing numbers of\r\npeople elsewhere fall and remain below the poverty line,\r\nwhere survival itself is the most pressing issue.\r\nI know that with its small, open economy, my\r\ncountry’s development is directly influenced by\r\ndevelopments in world markets for our products. Currently,\r\nmy country is suffering from the economic crisis\r\nexperienced by our major trading partners, in which we are\r\nforced to undertake significant reform programmes to\r\nprotect our economy and our people.\r\nIn this regard, we turn our attention to international\r\nfinancial institutions to help us restructure our economy.\r\nUnfortunately, we have had mixed reactions from them.\r\nSome of them, including the International Monetary Fund\r\nand the Asian Development Bank, have been very\r\npositive in their discussions with us, while others appear\r\nto be slow in responding. This leads me to think that\r\nsometimes some of these organizations are insensitive and\r\ndo not appreciate the difficulties and hardships faced by\r\nour people without their help.\r\nThis year, despite the El Niño drought and other\r\nnatural disasters that devastated my country, Papua New\r\nGuinea, we have continued to become more vigilant to\r\nthese challenges and to take remedial measures.\r\nNotwithstanding the hardship our economy is\r\nexperiencing because of the international economic crisis,\r\nthe value of our currency has consistently been\r\nrecovering. For Papua New Guinea to realize and sustain\r\nits current reform programmes, it has to secure external\r\nfinancial support.\r\nThe challenge is to forge a new global partnership\r\nfor change — a partnership in which both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries join together to address the issues\r\nthat the global community will face in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. This partnership will be necessary if the shared\r\nhopes of humanity for peace, justice and a better way of\r\nlife are to progress.\r\nI see my Government’s foreign policy of partnership\r\nin the Asia-Pacific as a building block for the global\r\npartnership on which the future depends. For developing\r\ncountries in particular, there is really no alternative way.\r\nIn facing the challenge of improving both the\r\nmaterial standards of living and the quality of life of our\r\npeople, we are carrying out comprehensive programmes\r\nof structural adjustment and changing our focus so that\r\nboth private and State resources can be directed to social\r\nwelfare and national development. Despite the negative\r\neffects of the current global crisis, we are achieving a\r\nstable economy, stabilizing our currency and attracting\r\ninvestments.\r\nWhen my Government came into office in July\r\n1997, my priority was the resolution of the nine-year-old\r\nBougainville conflict, which had caused terrible suffering\r\nand the loss of lives and property. Three factors — the\r\ndesire of the men and especially the women of\r\nBougainville to end the fighting, my desire for a\r\nconsensus resolution and the moral and practical support\r\nof Australia and New Zealand — led to a meeting in\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nBurnham, New Zealand, in October 1997 where a truce was\r\nsigned.\r\nAs an integral part of the truce, my Government\r\napproached our friends in the region to form an unarmed\r\nand neutral regional Truce Monitoring Group. The\r\nGovernment of the Solomon Islands — which played a\r\nvery constructive role in the processes — New Zealand,\r\nAustralia, Fiji and Vanuatu provided personnel to the Truce\r\nMonitoring Group, and its presence helped mutual\r\nconfidence-building and made people feel safe.\r\nThe peace monitoring group that took over on 1 May\r\nthis year continues to provide a positive role in maintaining\r\nand consolidating peace. In March this year, I met in\r\nLincoln, New Zealand, with the main Bougainvillean parties\r\ninvolved in the conflict, and we agreed that a permanent\r\nand irrevocable ceasefire should take effect from 30 April\r\n1998. Proceeding on a bipartisan-national basis and in close\r\nconsultation with all of the major Bougainville parties, I\r\nagreed that the State would approach the Security Council\r\nto endorse the Lincoln Agreement on Peace, Security and\r\nDevelopment on Bougainville. I also requested that the\r\nCouncil send a small observer mission to monitor and\r\nreport on developments.\r\nAs the internationally recognized representatives of all\r\nof the people of Papua New Guinea and being proud of\r\nPapua New Guinea’s independence and sovereignty, we\r\nmade these requests with mixed feelings, but with\r\ndetermination made strong by our faith in the cause of\r\npeace.\r\nI am pleased to report that the Security Council\r\nresponded positively to our request, and, through the efforts\r\nof other South Pacific Forum missions in New York and\r\nothers in close cooperation with the Secretary-General, the\r\nObserver Mission is now on Bougainville, operating side by\r\nside with the personnel of the peacekeeping mission.\r\nAs I speak, my Government is making arrangements\r\nfor a Bougainville restoration Government to take office\r\nwithin the framework of our Constitution before the end of\r\nthis year. At the same time, the people and leaders of\r\nBougainville are performing the traditional ceremonies of\r\nreconciliation.\r\nOur partners from Australia, New Zealand, the\r\nEuropean Union, Japan and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme are providing resources for\r\nrestoration and development. A number of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, including churches, the Red\r\nCross and Doctors Without Frontiers are also active. My\r\nGovernment is taking practical steps to strengthen civil\r\nauthority by training Bougainvillean policemen to work in\r\nBougainville.\r\nHaving begun the processes of peace in\r\nBougainville, we must now do everything we can to make\r\npeace work through peaceful means. While the peace\r\nprocess on Bougainville is still fragile, my Government is\r\nconfident that with the support of all Papua New\r\nGuineans and of our neighbours and friends in the\r\ninternational community, it will continue to gain strength.\r\nAs it gains strength, we expect direct international\r\ninvolvement to become of less importance, decreasing by\r\nagreement as mutual confidence and trust consolidates.\r\nThe Bougainville peace process has shown in a practical\r\nand constructive manner how people can seek\r\nreconciliation and forgiveness.\r\nThe Security Council, together with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, have given both moral, and through the Observer\r\nMission, visible and practical support.\r\nOn a separate though broadly related matter, Papua\r\nNew Guinea commends the United Nations on 50 years\r\nof cooperation in international peacekeeping and reaffirms\r\nits commitment to these processes. Papua New Guinea\r\nmakes a resolute commitment to the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter. In doing so, we\r\nrecognize that like any other institution, the United\r\nNations has limitations. Consistent with our view of the\r\nUnited Nations as a means of promoting global\r\ncooperation and partnership to meet the challenges of\r\nchange in the twenty-first century, Papua New Guinea\r\ncontinues in its strong belief that its moral values and\r\norganizations offer hope to humanity.\r\nConsistent with our commitment to the United\r\nNations, my Government is actively engaged in bringing\r\nour national laws, policies and practices into line with the\r\nimportant declarations and plans of action produced by\r\nthe United Nations. We give priority to implementing\r\nUnited Nations declarations and plans of action to\r\nadvance the rights of women and the elimination of child\r\nabuse.\r\nIn common with the other Member countries, we\r\nbelieve that it is timely to bring the United Nations\r\nCharter into line with contemporary reality by eliminating\r\nreferences to “enemy States”. Papua New Guinea strongly\r\nsupports calls for a new Security Council for the new\r\nmillennium.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, we\r\nendorse the Declaration issued by its thirteenth Summit,\r\nheld in Durban, South Africa.\r\nThe Security Council should be reformed and\r\nexpanded. An effective Security Council should be of a size\r\nand composition which matches the enhanced role that the\r\nworld expects it to play in coordinating global approaches\r\nand actions directed to deal with the issues we will all face\r\nin the twenty-first century. Consistent with the mutual\r\nrespect and equity on which partnership must be based,\r\nPapua New Guinea believes that all permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council should have similar privileges and\r\nrights.\r\nChanging the world from a system of relations\r\nbetween imperial Powers to a partnership between\r\nsovereign States through decolonization is among the\r\nUnited Nations greatest achievements. The process will not\r\nbe completed, as it must be, until the remaining 17\r\ndependent territories have exercised their inalienable right\r\nto self-determination. Neither small size nor remoteness\r\nshould be allowed to qualify or limit their rights. The\r\nrecently concluded South Pacific Forum, held in Pohnpei in\r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia, has confirmed its\r\nsupport for that right.\r\nAs one of the States which has always taken a close\r\ninterest in the situation and in the rights of the indigenous\r\nKanaks of New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea is pleased\r\nto note the progress made in implementing the Matignon\r\nAccords, culminating in the recent Agreement to the\r\nNoumea Accord.\r\nThe Noumea Accord will, we believe, provide a sound\r\nbasis for the future fulfilment of all legitimate political\r\naspirations. We urge all parties to honour both its letter and\r\nits spirit. The United Nations should continue to monitor\r\ndevelopments in New Caledonia until implementation is\r\ncomplete and self-determination has been achieved.\r\nMore than 80 per cent of Papua New Guineans live in\r\nrural villages, where they depend directly on the land,\r\nrivers, lakes and sea for their livelihood. Our national\r\nConstitution commits us to use and develop the rich variety\r\nof the country’s natural resources for the common good and\r\nthe benefit of future generations. In doing so, it upholds the\r\nmost up-to-date principles of international environmental\r\nlaw. The same provisions also provide a sound basis for\r\ndomestic policy and law-making.\r\nPapua New Guinea has spoken out strongly and\r\nworked actively on a wide range of environmental issues.\r\nConsistent with our record and ongoing commitment, my\r\nGovernment will shortly be signing and then ratifying the\r\nKyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change. In line with the\r\nimportance we attach to such matters, Papua New Guinea\r\nis party to conventions arising out of the Rio Summit on\r\nenvironment and development and Agenda 21. My\r\nGovernment will continue to follow and support the\r\nfuture work of the Commission, including efforts to\r\ntranslate and integrate internationally agreed objectives\r\nand standards into domestic laws and programmes of\r\naction.\r\nLike other members of the South Pacific Forum,\r\nPapua New Guinea is firmly committed to the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island States. We strongly urge its full\r\nimplementation. Together with other States in the region,\r\nwe have joined as partners with distant-water-fishing\r\nnations to develop a programme to manage the\r\nsustainable use of tuna stocks in the western and central\r\nPacific.\r\nThe world’s leading scientists have concluded that\r\nthe rise in global temperatures poses serious threats, such\r\nas sea-level rise and an increase in natural catastrophes,\r\nsuch as the El Niño phenomenon.\r\nPapua New Guinea, together with the small island\r\nStates in the Pacific, will continue to stress the urgency\r\nfor developed countries to take a strong lead in the\r\nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nThe Kyoto Protocol has paved the way for annex I\r\ncountries to fulfil their commitments under the\r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Protocol itself.\r\nWe urge those parties to translate their legally binding\r\ntargets for the reduction of their emissions into concrete\r\naction. While it is our firm conviction that there must be\r\na global approach, we cannot support shifting the burden\r\nto developing countries as a precondition for the\r\nratification of the Protocol.\r\nAt the recent South Pacific Forum meeting, our\r\nGovernment, together with other heads of the South\r\nPacific region, confirmed our support for the South\r\nPacific Environmental Programme and the Forum\r\nFisheries Agency (FFA) as a key sector. The FFA\r\nprogramme will ensure the maintenance of sustainable\r\nfisheries in the region as well as enhance the economic\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nsecurity of coastal States, particularly those economies\r\nwhich are highly dependent on this one resource.\r\nThis is the International Year of the Ocean. Papua\r\nNew Guinea will work actively with other South Pacific\r\nMissions in New York to commemorate this Year, with\r\nparticular emphasis on the sustainable use of resources\r\nderived from the oceans.\r\nWith its recent share of national disasters, some of\r\nwhich have taken the ultimate human toll, Papua New\r\nGuinea is concerned about climate change, rising sea levels\r\nand the urgent need to reduce carbon and other emissions\r\nin the atmosphere. Having experienced natural disasters at\r\nfirst hand, I would say that the greatest challenge for the\r\nUnited Nations is to strengthen the global community’s\r\ncapacity to respond promptly and effectively to natural\r\ndisasters. I am sure that my friends from China and\r\nBangladesh, where large areas have recently been\r\ndevastated by floods, would agree. Papua New Guinea\r\nstrongly supports the renewal of the International Decade\r\nfor Natural Disaster Reduction and preparedness and the\r\nYokohama Strategy adopted in 1993.\r\nConsistent with our shared commitment to a stable,\r\npeaceful and environmentally safe world, my Government\r\nsupports the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We support efforts to ban\r\ntransboundary movements of radioactive and other\r\nhazardous wastes in and through our region and to ensure\r\nthat damage arising from nuclear explosions is adequately\r\ncompensated.\r\nTogether with our partners in the South Pacific Forum,\r\nwe recently reaffirmed our determination to maintain the\r\nSouth Pacific as a nuclear-free zone. We also expressed our\r\nsupport for the other regional nuclear-free zones, in Africa,\r\nSouth-East Asia and the Latin American and Caribbean\r\nregion, and the proposed new initiative in Central and\r\nSouth Asia. Like people and Governments throughout the\r\nworld, we in the South Pacific were seriously concerned\r\nabout the series of nuclear weapons tests conducted by\r\nIndia and Pakistan. The best course of action would be not\r\nonly to stop testing now but also to destroy all nuclear\r\nweapons. Papua New Guinea believes that the same should\r\napply to all weapons of mass destruction in other parts of\r\nthe world.\r\nEncouraged at the positive signs of progress towards\r\nresolving conflicts and securing peace in several areas of\r\ntension and concern in Asia and Africa, Papua New Guinea\r\nnonetheless remains anxious over recent developments\r\naffecting Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Eritrea and Ethiopia. We are heartened by the\r\nefforts made by the Organization of African Unity to\r\nrestore peace and stability in the Great Lakes region.\r\nAlso, we support the initiative of President Nelson\r\nMandela of South Africa to revive a common vision for\r\npeace in Africa.\r\nConsistent with our commitment to peaceful\r\ndialogue between nations, Papua New Guinea condemns\r\nthose who employ terrorism against innocent people,\r\nincluding women and children. Diplomacy is the means\r\nby which States join together as partners and cooperate in\r\nbringing about changes to promote peace, development\r\nand justice for people both in principle and, even more\r\nimportantly, in practice. It is therefore vital that diplomats\r\nbe able to live and work safely, free from the threat of\r\nterrorism, such as that practised against American\r\ndiplomats in Africa.\r\nIn this connection, following recent events on our\r\ncommon border with Indonesia, my Government would\r\nlike to make clear its strong and consistent recognition of\r\nthe sovereignty of Indonesia, including Irian Jaya, and the\r\ncontinuing mutual respect in all aspects of our\r\nrelationship.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Papua New\r\nGuinea’s commitments to the United Nations Charter; to\r\nthe inalienable rights of the independent territories to self-\r\ndetermination, noting the Matignon and Noumea accords\r\nfor the Kanak people of New Caledonia; the declaration\r\nto advance the rights of women and eliminate child abuse;\r\nto our determination to maintain global natural disaster\r\npreparedness; to work actively in commemorating the\r\nYear of the Ocean; to the ratification of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol on global warming; and to the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island States.\r\nPartnership in promoting change is the key to\r\naddressing the challenges that the world will face in the\r\ntwenty-first century. I believe the challenge for the\r\nMember States is to join together to change this\r\nOrganization for the better so that it will serve as an\r\neffective basis for partnership, to address and resolve the\r\nissues that lie ahead.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nPrime Minister of Papua New Guinea for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nThe Honourable William Skate, Prime Minister of\r\nPapua New Guinea, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Keizo Obuchi, Prime Minister of Japan\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime Minister\r\nof Japan.\r\nMr. Keizo Obuchi, Prime Minister of Japan, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I take\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Keizo\r\nObuchi, Prime Minister of Japan, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Obuchi (Japan) (spoke in Japanese;\r\ninterpretation furnished by the delegation): I should like to\r\nextend my most sincere compliments to you, Sir, Foreign\r\nMinister of Uruguay, on your assumption of office as\r\nPresident of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nI should also like to express my respects to Mr. Hennadiy\r\nUdovenko, Deputy of the Supreme Rada of Ukraine, for all\r\nhis efforts during his tenure as President of the fifty-second\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nHow should we build the framework for a new\r\ninternational order in the twenty-first century? This is the\r\nquestion that our international community is facing amidst\r\nnew situations that were created in the aftermath of the\r\ncollapse of the cold war, almost a decade ago. That\r\ncollapse provided an opportunity to establish a harmonious\r\norder based upon the cooperation of the entire international\r\ncommunity, rather than the maintenance of peace by a\r\nmilitary balance between two super-Powers. However, our\r\ninternational community today is troubled with frequent\r\nregional conflicts and challenged by the inseparably\r\nconnected problem of poverty. Creating a new system to\r\ncope effectively with such challenges is the greatest agenda\r\nfor our international community today. To achieve this\r\nobjective, we must simultaneously promote three issues:\r\npeace and development, which are two sides of the same\r\ncoin, plus United Nations reforms, which are indispensable\r\nin our efforts to achieve the first two.\r\nToday, the possibility of a world-wide conflict has\r\ndecreased in comparison to the cold-war era, but conflicts\r\narising from such causes as ethnic and religious\r\nconfrontation are increasing. In dealing with these\r\nconflicts, it is more important to focus on how to prevent\r\nthem rather than on how to solve them once they break\r\nout. In this regard, we must first consider the essential\r\nissues of arms control and disarmament. The recent\r\nnuclear tests of India and Pakistan constitute enormous\r\nchallenges to the non-proliferation regime. We urgently\r\nneed to find a way to prevent the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and to\r\nstrengthen the non-proliferation regime. Furthermore, it is\r\nnecessary to deal not only with the weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, such as nuclear, biological and chemical\r\nweapons, but also with such conventional weapons as\r\nsmall arms and anti-personnel landmines.\r\nSocial instabilities lie at the root of conflicts. This\r\nmakes it extremely important to deal with development\r\nissues. There are also growing global threats, such as\r\nenvironmental destruction and terrorism. The cruel\r\ndestructive power of terrorism especially threatens the\r\nlives and safety of citizens. It is different by nature from\r\nconventional armed conflict between nations, but in the\r\npost-cold-war world it poses increasingly grave concerns\r\nto our security. Our international community should\r\nseriously consider ways to effectively cope with these\r\nproblems and threats.\r\nToday, based on such thinking, I should like to\r\ndiscuss these issues from the perspectives of peace and\r\ndevelopment and of reform, which is indispensable in\r\npromoting the first two. In so doing, I want to elaborate\r\non our thinking and express our determination to play a\r\nleading role in fulfilling our responsibilities.\r\nI should first like to talk about nuclear non-\r\nproliferation, arms control and disarmament, which are\r\nessential to maintaining peace. In May this year, India\r\nand Pakistan conducted, to our deepest regret, a series of\r\nnuclear tests, which are formidable challenges to the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. In seeking a world free\r\nof nuclear weapons, it is indispensable that we allow no\r\nfurther proliferation and secure a solid basis for the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. The existing format\r\ncertainly is not perfect, but there is no feasible, realistic\r\nalternative if we are to ensure stability in our international\r\ncommunity. No country should be allowed to attempt to\r\nset back international efforts towards strengthening the\r\nnon-proliferation regime. At the same time, to improve\r\nthe effectiveness of this regime, it is important, together\r\nwith the efforts by all nations to maintain non-\r\nproliferation, to see sincere implementation of nuclear\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\ndisarmament by nuclear-weapon States. Based on this\r\nthinking, we regard the following five points as important.\r\nFirst, the nuclear non-proliferation regime should\r\nbecome more universal. The Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) sets the structure\r\nfor international control of nuclear weapons, with no\r\nalternative, and we strongly urge non-parties to accede to\r\nthis Treaty promptly and without condition. In this context,\r\nwe highly appreciate Brazil’s accession to the NPT in\r\nAugust this year.\r\nSecondly, in order to complement the NPT and ensure\r\nnuclear non-proliferation, I should like to underline the\r\nneed to place strict export controls on equipment, materials\r\nand technologies that relate to nuclear weapons and\r\nmissiles. We urge every nation to engage in serious efforts\r\nto prevent any transfer of such materials and technologies.\r\nThirdly, we must prevent any further nuclear testing.\r\nWithout universal support for the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the effectiveness of the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation system cannot be maintained. I should like\r\nto call on nations that have not yet done so to promptly\r\nbecome parties to this Treaty so as to realize its early\r\neffectuation. In the meantime, we should take necessary\r\nsteps to assure the cessation of nuclear testing.\r\nFourthly, further advancement of nuclear disarmament\r\nby nuclear-weapon States is more important than ever in\r\nmaintaining and strengthening various efforts for nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation. We hope to see early effectuation of\r\nSTART II and an early launching of negotiations on\r\nSTART III. Also, we welcome such actions as the decision\r\nby the British Government in July this year for a significant\r\nreduction of their nuclear arsenals, as well as France’s\r\ndecision to dismantle its ground-to-ground missiles. We\r\nurge all the nuclear-weapon States to implement sincerely\r\ntheir obligations under article 6 of the NPT, thereby\r\npromoting nuclear disarmament even further.\r\nFifthly, to put a cap on nuclear-weapons capability,\r\neach nation must positively participate in and reach an early\r\nconclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty.\r\nDuring this session of the General Assembly, Japan\r\nwill take initiatives to promote these five objectives.\r\nNeedless to say, the promotion of arms control and\r\ndisarmament should not be limited to the area of nuclear\r\nweapons. Dealing with other weapons of mass destruction,\r\nsuch as biological and chemical weapons, as well as\r\ndelivery vehicles, such as missiles, is of high importance.\r\nThe recent missile launch by North Korea, even if it was\r\nan attempt to launch a satellite into orbit, poses a serious\r\nproblem which directly concerns both Japan’s national\r\nsecurity and peace and stability in North-East Asia. It also\r\nconstitutes a challenge to our efforts to prevent the\r\nproliferation of delivery vehicles of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. I renew my call for North Korea to consider\r\nseriously the 15 September statement by the President of\r\nthe Security Council as a message reflecting the views of\r\nthe entire international community, and to never repeat\r\nsuch an act.\r\nFurthermore, to prevent the outbreak and escalation\r\nof conflicts, we also need to address the problems of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines and small arms, including automatic\r\nrifles, regarding which we have yet to make sufficient\r\nefforts. We intend to continue to play a leading role on\r\nthese issues. In particular, in the area of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines we will endeavour to strengthen international\r\ncooperation towards early realization of the “zero victim”\r\nobjective, by supporting assistance for victims and the\r\nelimination of landmines. We are pleased that 40\r\ncountries have now ratified the Convention banning anti-\r\npersonnel landmines and that it will enter into force on 1\r\nMarch next year. We are now making efforts for Japan’s\r\nearliest possible ratification of this Convention. We ask\r\nother nations yet to ratify it to do so promptly, so that it\r\nmay become a universal framework to ban anti-personnel\r\nlandmines totally.\r\nConflicts give rise to intolerable crimes against\r\nhumanity, such as genocide. To deter such crimes, it is\r\nnecessary to establish a permanent international court that\r\npunishes such acts as international crimes. Adoption of\r\nthe agreement in July this year in Rome to establish such\r\na court was an act of historic significance. Japan believes\r\nthat the blessing and cooperation of the entire\r\ninternational community is indispensable if the court is to\r\nproduce effective results. That is why we took important\r\ninitiatives at the Diplomatic Conference. It is our hope\r\nthat the International Criminal Court will continue to\r\ngrow and become a universal framework.\r\nIn our efforts towards peace, with civilian staff\r\nassuming an increasing role in United Nations activities,\r\nincluding peacekeeping, we observe with regret an\r\nincreasing number of cases where non-combatants become\r\nthe targets of violence by belligerents. In July this year,\r\na staff member from Japan, together with staff members\r\nfrom Poland, Tajikistan and Uruguay, fell victim to a\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\ndespicable criminal act directed at the United Nations\r\nMission of Observers in Tajikistan. The countries concerned\r\nand the United Nations need to seriously examine ways to\r\nensure the security of United Nations personnel and of\r\nrelevant humanitarian-assistance organizations. In this\r\nregard, we reiterate our call upon nations that have not yet\r\ndone so to join the Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel, adopted in December\r\n1994, so that it may come into force as soon as possible. At\r\nthe same time, Japan will also make contributions of about\r\n$1 million to the United Nations to support security\r\nmeasures for United Nations personnel. We hope many\r\nother countries will also make contributions to support\r\nUnited Nations efforts in this field.\r\nSome of the basic causes of conflicts are problems of\r\neconomic and social development. We must pay close\r\nattention to them. During the Tokyo International\r\nConference on Preventive Strategy, which Japan hosted this\r\nJanuary, participants underlined the importance of a\r\ncomprehensive approach in dealing with such problems by\r\ncoming to grips with various causes of them, including\r\npoverty.\r\nThe development issue is the greatest challenge the\r\nworld will face in the twenty-first century. In addressing\r\nthis issue, we have to deal not only with the economic-\r\ndevelopment problems of the developing countries, but also\r\nwith the social sides of development, such as human rights\r\nand good governance.\r\nJapan has been advocating a new development strategy\r\nthat contains such ideas. We are pleased that the concept\r\nwas endorsed in 1996 at the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development and has been gaining support\r\nin the United Nations. This strategy is based on the\r\nphilosophy that the international community should make\r\nno distinction between donor countries and recipient\r\ncountries and should tackle the problems of development as\r\na common issue for all. In this regard, this strategy attaches\r\ngreat importance to developing countries’ playing an active\r\nand responsible role in their own development. It also\r\nemphasizes positive cooperation based on partnership\r\nwithout distinction between developing and developed\r\ncountries. These are the guiding principles of the new\r\ndevelopment strategy.\r\nOn the basis of these principles, the Second Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD II) will be held in Japan this October as a follow-\r\nup to the first Conference, held in 1993. Its objective is to\r\nseek a path to promote the new development strategy in\r\nAfrica so as to support African countries’ own nation-\r\nbuilding efforts. In this regard, we aim to draw up an\r\nagenda for action.\r\nJapan also has been making the greatest\r\ncontributions possible to the stable development of Asia.\r\nIn the present financial and economic crisis we have\r\ntaken initiatives to implement measures of support\r\ntotalling about $43 billion to Asian countries, which is the\r\nlargest single contribution by any nation in the world.\r\nSimultaneously, Japan is making every possible effort,\r\nthrough such measures as stabilizing our financial system,\r\nto put our own economy on a recovery track within the\r\nnext year or two. We believe that the early recovery of\r\nour own economy is the best contribution we can make to\r\nthe economies of Asia and of the world. We hope\r\nstrongly that the coming conference, TICAD II, will\r\nbenefit from such Asian experiences and provide a good\r\nopportunity to use the wisdom and power of the entire\r\ninternational community to assist the development of the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nIn the post-cold-war transformation of international\r\nrelations, Japan is actively promoting what we call\r\nEurasian diplomacy. This means redefining relations with\r\ncountries of the Eurasian continent, including the Russian\r\nFederation, the People’s Republic of China, the Republic\r\nof Korea and countries in the Silk Road regions of\r\nCentral Asia and the Caucasus range. This is another\r\nexample of Japan’s policy of promoting peace and\r\ndevelopment in tandem.\r\nIn today’s world, problems that directly threaten\r\npeople’s daily lives across national borders are becoming\r\nincreasingly serious. These include environmental\r\ndestruction, overpopulation, human rights violations, the\r\nexodus of refugees, terrorism, drug-trafficking,\r\ninternational organized crime and global diseases such as\r\nAIDS. To cope with these problems, our international\r\ncommunity must be united under the concept of\r\nprotecting the security and dignity of mankind from\r\nglobal threats. Furthermore, citizens, along with\r\nGovernments, must get together to engage in common\r\nundertakings, such as making common rules. In particular,\r\nas we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, I should like to\r\npoint out that efforts against large-scale human rights\r\nviolations and efforts to ease refugee problems arising\r\nfrom conflicts are also indispensable for preventing\r\nconflicts.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nIn addressing issues of peace and development, there\r\nis an urgent need to reform the United Nations and to\r\nstrengthen its functions. Peace and development are two\r\nsides of the same coin. At the same time, if the United\r\nNations is to respond effectively to various problems that\r\nour international community shoulders, we urgently need to\r\ndo our best to assure a healthy financial basis. This includes\r\neach Member State’s sincere implementation of its\r\nobligation to pay its assessed contribution. Japan’s\r\nassessment will be over 20 per cent, exceeding the sum of\r\nthat of four permanent members of the Security Council,\r\nnot including the United States. In this situation, reform in\r\nthe financial area requires serious attention. In reforming\r\nthe United Nations to strengthen its functioning, we must\r\npromote reforms in three interrelated areas in a balanced\r\nmanner: reform in the political area, the development area,\r\nand the financial area, which supports political and\r\ndevelopment activities.\r\nIt is regrettable that even though the chances of\r\nmaterializing reforms increased during last year’s General\r\nAssembly session, discussions on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil have not developed since then. Under the\r\ncircumstances facing the international community I\r\nmentioned earlier, reforming the Security Council to\r\nreinforce its legitimacy and effectiveness is an urgent task.\r\nJapan, with the endorsement of many countries, is prepared\r\nto assume greater responsibilities as a permanent member\r\nof the Security Council. This would be in accordance with\r\nour basic philosophy of non-resort to the use of force\r\nprohibited by our Constitution. We are now in the fifth year\r\nsince the concrete discussions on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil started. Points of argument have been exhausted.\r\nWe are now at a stage where each country should make a\r\npolitical decision. Japan believes that we are able to agree\r\non a package that responds to the interests of the entire\r\ninternational community and to the legitimate concerns of\r\nthe majority of countries. If we do not have the will to\r\ndecide and act in order to achieve an agreement on such a\r\npackage, we will not be able to respond effectively to\r\nchallenges the international community will face in the\r\ncoming century. Japan strongly urges all countries to make\r\na bold political decision for the strengthening of the United\r\nNations so that we may reach an agreement on the\r\nframework of the reform during the present session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe twenty-first century is just around the corner. It is\r\nour duty to preserve and develop the heritage of mankind\r\nin the coming century. The late professor, Mr. Yutaka\r\nAkino, who gave his life during his mission of\r\npeacekeeping in Tajikistan, was one of my close friends.\r\nHe had the following motto: do not be pushed around by\r\nevents; take action. Along the same lines, the United\r\nNations should make action a top priority and become a\r\nstrong Organization equipped with both effectiveness and\r\ncredibility, squarely tackling all problems. We the\r\nMember States should make utmost efforts to achieve it,\r\nso that the United Nations can enter the twenty-first\r\ncentury as such an Organization. The future of the United\r\nNations is in the hands of the Member States. My guiding\r\nprinciple in Japan’s policy management is to be sincere,\r\nto be steady and to be courageously prompt. I therefore\r\nshould like to conclude my remarks by emphasizing my\r\nresolution to take leadership in addressing issues of peace,\r\ndevelopment and reform in a sincere, steady and\r\ncourageously prompt manner.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of Japan for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Keizo Obuchi, Prime Minister of Japan, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nInternational Trade and Worship of the Argentine\r\nRepublic, His Excellency Mr. Guido di Tella.\r\nMr. Di Tella (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): Allow me, first of all, to congratulate you, Mr.\r\nPresident, on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Secondly, allow me to express the\r\nprofound regard and warm ties that unite Argentina and\r\nUruguay, an ongoing relationship that was already under\r\nway at the beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\nWe also extend our appreciation to Ambassador\r\nUdovenko for the courage, balance and impartiality he\r\nexhibited during the course of his mandate.\r\nIn a globalized world, peace and security, economic\r\nstability and growth are more than ever indissolubly\r\nlinked. The economic and financial crisis that concerns us\r\ntoday should boost our commitment to the economic\r\nreform process which we are carrying out in our region.\r\nTrade and foreign investment are clearly sources of\r\nopportunity and incentives to growth and competitiveness.\r\nBut it is also clear that in recent decades the free\r\nmovement of capital flows has been one of the main\r\nengines of economic development for many countries.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nIn order to dispel its negative effects, globalization\r\nrequires educational, social and environmental policies that\r\nbenefit all of society in a balanced and equitable manner.\r\nWe feel it is damaging to succumb to the temptation of\r\nimposing restrictions on international trade in order to\r\nthwart the spread of economic crisis, or to resort to\r\nhampering or placing conditions on the flow of financial\r\nresources in order to moderate their volatility.\r\nIn Latin America, countries such as Argentina have\r\nmade sustained and coherent efforts to consolidate their\r\nfinancial situation, contain the budget deficit and provide\r\nassurances to foreign investment by helping to create a\r\nsolid economic environment for the region, which is\r\nincreasingly being seen with new eyes.\r\nA few days ago, the Presidents of the Rio Group,\r\nmeeting in Panama, expressed their resolve to continue\r\nmanaging economic policy mechanisms in a responsible\r\nmanner that guarantees stability and growth. Accordingly,\r\nfinancial institutions and those countries with the capacity\r\nto provide assistance should understand the problems that\r\nthis critical economic situation presents to countries that\r\nfind themselves in the eye of the storm and act accordingly.\r\nThe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)\r\nis today a model of economic foundations based on\r\nfreedom and democracy in which cooperation is the very\r\nessence of the system.\r\nAs an illustration of the excellent relations in the area\r\nof security and defense, Argentina pressed for the adoption\r\nof the Political Declaration of MERCOSUR, Bolivia and\r\nChile as a Zone of Peace, which was signed at the\r\nMERCOSUR summit held in Argentina on 24 July 1998.\r\nThe recent nuclear tests in South Asia constituted a\r\nstep backwards with regard to regional and global security.\r\nThese tests delay the economic development and well-being\r\nof the population. Argentina, together with countries that\r\nhave renounced the military use of nuclear technology, has\r\nurged the States of that region to stop conducting tests and\r\nto adhere to the international instruments in force.\r\nArgentina, for its part, has offered to share fully its\r\nexperience in peaceful nuclear cooperation. Allow me to\r\nrecall that Argentina was the first country that, having\r\nmastered the nuclear fuel cycle, chose to limit its own use\r\nof this technology.\r\nWe feel proud of the steps our country has taken in\r\nthe last decade related to non-proliferation issues. In the\r\nnuclear field, we ratified the Treaty for the Prohibition of\r\nNuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean\r\n(Treaty of Tlatelolco) in 1994 and the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1995, and\r\nhave become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\r\nIn the chemical and bacteriological field, we have\r\npromoted the Joint Declaration on the Complete\r\nProhibition of Chemical and Biological Weapons — the\r\nMendoza Agreement — of 1991, a commitment originally\r\nlimited to Argentina, Brazil and Chile, which was later\r\nextended to most Latin American countries. We have also\r\nadjusted our domestic legislation strictly to control\r\nexports related to dual-use chemical, bacteriological and\r\nmissile-related substances and technologies, in accordance\r\nwith existing international instruments. Last July, as a\r\nfollow-up to the Mendoza Agreement, we adopted the\r\nUshuaia Declaration, which established the Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR) as an area free of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Hence, Argentina has taken\r\nthe decision to assume greater responsibility in this field.\r\nIn turn, this decision has allowed us to continue\r\nexchanges of advanced technology.\r\nIn relation to conventional weapons, we strongly\r\nsupport the United Nations Register of Conventional\r\nArms, to which we regularly provide information. We\r\nalso support other important initiatives recently adopted\r\nwithin the framework of the Organization of American\r\nStates (OAS), such as the Inter-American Convention\r\nagainst the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in\r\nFirearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related\r\nMaterials and Other Appropriate Actions. Small arms\r\nconstitute another source of international concern. It is\r\nworth mentioning that regional and international seminars\r\nhave recently been held in Buenos Aires on this topic.\r\nWe are not indifferent to the grave scourge of\r\nantipersonnel mines. In 1995, Argentina established a\r\nmoratorium on the export of mines and more recently, in\r\nDecember 1997 at Ottawa, I had the honour to sign, on\r\nmy country’s behalf, the Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\r\nIn our hemisphere we work earnestly and in a spirit\r\nof compromise to overcome all differences by means of\r\nnegotiation. As we gradually resolve the few pending\r\nbilateral disputes, we will definitively consolidate our\r\nregion as a zone of peace. We trust that in coming\r\nmonths we shall see important developments in that\r\nregard. Friendship among peoples is the best guarantee\r\nagainst conflict.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nWe are convinced that the United Nations presence in\r\nHaiti, in keeping with the desire of the Government of that\r\ncountry, will help to consolidate democracy and contribute\r\nto the prosperity of the Haitian people.\r\nThe resurgence of terrorist attacks comes as a harsh\r\nreminder that no State is immune to terrorism. My country\r\nfirmly supports the initiatives under way to supplement with\r\nnew conventions the network of anti-terrorism norms now\r\nin force, leading to enhanced international cooperation and\r\nto establishing the obligation of all States to bring to justice\r\nand punish those responsible for these acts. The Argentine\r\nGovernment continues to make every effort to clarify the\r\nacts of terrorism committed against the Israeli embassy and\r\nthe Argentine Israelite Mutual Association in Buenos Aires.\r\nLet me highlight the fact that on 2 September 1998 the\r\nArgentine Republic signed the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. Likewise, next\r\nNovember Argentina will host the second specialized inter-\r\nAmerican conference on terrorism.\r\nSevere global humanitarian crises, usually\r\naccompanied by forced displacement of populations,\r\nconstitute another issue that affects international peace and\r\nsecurity. Argentina has joined in the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts, with bilateral assistance programmes\r\nand with such initiatives as the “White Helmets” initiative.\r\nIn that context, intergovernmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations devoting their energies to the solution of this\r\ntype of crisis deserve our recognition.\r\nTo grow and develop, peoples need to live in peace.\r\nWe are dismayed to see that conflicts which could be\r\novercome, such as those in Cyprus, the Middle East, the\r\nGreat Lakes region of Africa, Angola and the Balkans,\r\nparticularly Kosovo, persist in spite of the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts to resolve them. The situation of\r\nrefugees, especially children, who are victims of these\r\nconflicts is a source of particular concern.\r\nIn 1998 Argentina will mark the fortieth anniversary\r\nof its participation in peacekeeping operations. Our\r\ncontribution has cost the lives of Argentine citizens who\r\nhelped to make this a more secure and stable world. The\r\nvast experience acquired over these 40 years has been\r\nembodied in the Argentine joint training centre for\r\npeacekeeping operations, and in the Argentine gendarmerie\r\ntraining centre that specializes in civilian police operations\r\nabroad.\r\nArgentina’s natural interest in the South Atlantic is\r\nreflected in our participation in the Zone of Peace and\r\nCooperation of the South Atlantic, which brings together\r\n24 African and Latin American countries from both\r\nshores of the Atlantic. I am particularly proud to\r\nannounce that, on 21 and 22 October, Argentina will be\r\nthe site of the fifth Ministerial Meeting of the countries\r\nmembers of the Zone.\r\nUnfortunately, there remains an important unresolved\r\nissue in the South Atlantic: the sovereignty dispute\r\nbetween the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom\r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland over the Malvinas\r\nIslands, a dispute whose existence has been unequivocally\r\nrecognized in many resolutions of the General Assembly\r\nand of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard\r\nto the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting\r\nof Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as\r\nwell as in various other international forums. I reiterate,\r\nwith the same conviction as always, the legitimate and\r\nwell-founded rights of Argentina in that long-standing\r\ndispute. And, with the same conviction as always, I urge\r\nthe United Kingdom to heed the call of the international\r\ncommunity and observe United Nations resolutions calling\r\nupon both Governments to resume negotiations on all\r\naspects of this question.\r\nThe end of the cold war showed us that far more\r\ncomplicated problems have been resolved through frank,\r\nopen dialogue and with a determination to reach a\r\nmutually acceptable agreement. I see no reason why the\r\nquestion of the Malvinas Islands should be an exception.\r\nProceeding on firm footing, we have rebuilt our bilateral\r\nrelationship and, for the benefit of the Argentine and\r\nBritish peoples, have strengthened political, trade and\r\ncultural ties. Evidence of this is the visit which President\r\nCarlos Menem is to make to the United Kingdom in the\r\nnear future, for which both parties are engaged in\r\nenthusiastic preparations and which has generated high\r\nexpectations at all levels.\r\nSimilarly, we have left behind the misgivings and\r\nresentments of the past, learning from our mistakes and\r\ncreating a climate of mutual trust in the South-West\r\nAtlantic, which is today enabling us to cooperate in the\r\nconservation of fishery resources and in exploration for\r\nhydrocarbons. That cooperation renders still more\r\nincomprehensible today’s lack of communication between\r\nthe islands and the mainland. There are few places in the\r\nworld with such an unnatural situation. It is beyond doubt\r\nthat restoring direct ties between the mainland and the\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nislands would contribute to resolving the problem. We have\r\nno doubt about this.\r\nOnce again, I expressly reiterate Argentina’s sincere\r\ndesire to pursue a frank dialogue without preconditions. We\r\nhope that the British Government understands the full\r\nmeaning of our offer and that it will respond accordingly.\r\nTo the islanders I reiterate our unwavering commitment to\r\nfull and unconditional respect for their way of life, their\r\nculture and their institutions. Our national constitution so\r\nprovides, and that is the desire of the Argentine people.\r\nThere have been concrete advances on vital questions.\r\nThe creation of a permanent international criminal court is\r\none such example. Similarly, the recent special session of\r\nthe General Assembly devoted to the world problem of\r\ndrugs adopted innovative documents of great importance.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and of the adoption\r\nof the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the\r\nCrime of Genocide. In these 50 years, the international\r\ncommunity has become aware of the vital importance of\r\nhuman rights: today it no longer accepts what was once\r\ntolerated.\r\nThe deterioration of the environment, in its various\r\nforms, is one of the problems urgently requiring concrete\r\nanswers and effective commitment by governments and\r\ncivil society. Argentina will have the honour of hosting the\r\nfourth Conference of the Parties to the Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change, from 2 to 13 November of\r\nthis year.\r\nWe are convinced that a substantial part of our efforts\r\nto reform the Organization should be geared to designing a\r\nmechanism of closer and more effective cooperation with\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nWith regard to reform of the Security Council, we\r\nbelieve that situations born out of the Second World War\r\ncannot prevail indefinitely. It is necessary to find\r\ndemocratic solutions that will allow for periodic renewal\r\nwithin the modalities preferred by each region. The viability\r\nof this reform will necessarily depend on the degree of\r\nconsensus reached. There are several aspects to be borne in\r\nmind. The first is that the reform must be legally valid,\r\nwhich means not forcing interpretations of the Charter with\r\nregard to the majorities required by Article 108. Further,\r\nthe reform must be founded on political legitimacy. Any\r\nincrease in the number of permanent members should allow\r\nfor a rotation open to all States of the respective regions.\r\nThe crisis of our Organization is fundamentally one of\r\nparticipation. Many small and medium-sized countries\r\nfeel excluded. Only by allowing greater participation in\r\nthe Security Council will we be living up to the\r\ndemocratic ideals of the end of this century.\r\nThe vitality of democratic ideals in the region was\r\nconfirmed with the signing on 24 July of the Ushuaia\r\nprotocol, which reaffirms the democratic clause in the\r\ncountries of the Southern Cone Common Market\r\n(MERCOSUR), Bolivia and Chile.\r\nThe visit by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nto the countries of our region last July was a very\r\nsignificant event. Argentina had the opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate its clear commitment to assuming its global\r\nresponsibilities. The Secretary-General recognized this,\r\nespecially as regards peacekeeping.\r\nThe President (interpretation from Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nIndonesia, His Excellency Mr. Ali Alatas.\r\nMr. Alatas (Indonesia): It gives me great pleasure,\r\nSir, to extend to you my congratulations and those of the\r\nIndonesian delegation on your election to the presidency\r\nof the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. I\r\nshould like to assure you of our full cooperation in the\r\ndischarge of your duties.\r\nTo your distinguished predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Hennadiy Udovenko, I wish to convey our\r\nfelicitations for having so ably guided the fifty-second\r\nsession to a successful conclusion.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor his dedication to the reform and restructuring of the\r\nOrganization, as well as for his determined efforts to seek\r\na peaceful solution to conflict situations in various parts\r\nof the world.\r\nOne of the great ironies of our time is that at the end\r\nof a century in which the amazing advances of science\r\nand technology could have been harnessed to effectively\r\naddress the problem of poverty, scores of millions more\r\npeople have slipped below the poverty line. At the same\r\ntime, there has been a massive application of science and\r\ntechnology to increase humankind’s capacity to deal out\r\ndeath and destruction. Even in the best of times,\r\nhumankind’s use of economic resources has not been\r\nmarked by any deep sense of responsibility but rather by\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nmindless consumption that has often led to the degradation\r\nof our environment. Unfortunately squandering resources is\r\nan old habit of the human race.\r\nMr. Filali (Morocco), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nToday, I fear that the awesome force of globalization,\r\nitself propelled by science and technology, is also being\r\nsquandered: instead of serving to unify humankind in a\r\ndecisive assault against the persistent systemic problems of\r\nour time, it is being used to press the advantage of the\r\nstrong over the weak, thereby widening the gap between the\r\ndeveloped and developing world.\r\nHerein lies the tragedy of the human race: that our\r\nvast capacity to alter the planet on which we live has been\r\nmatched to a parochial vision. Large and complex actions\r\nare motivated by narrow self-interest. And in the\r\nnarrowness of our perspective we inflict great harm on one\r\nanother. That is why the imbalances and inequities in\r\ninternational relations persist: we can never get rid of them\r\nuntil we attain that essential balance within ourselves,\r\nbetween the scope of our actions and that of our intentions.\r\nYet I do not despair. Against the backdrop of a\r\ncentury of conflict, one human achievement shines: the\r\nfounding of the United Nations. It is admittedly a flawed\r\nachievement, for after five decades it has not yet brought us\r\nthe global peace that we envisaged to be its greatest\r\npromise. But it has spared us from the horrors of another\r\nworld war and possibly from a nuclear holocaust. That this\r\nflawed jewel of human reason should remain to serve us in\r\na more effective way in the next century is an imperative.\r\nThrough its instrumentality, it is still possible for us to tame\r\nthe dogs of war and to exorcise the spectre of poverty.\r\nThrough its processes of consultation and debate, we can\r\nstill attain a broadness of mind that matches the global\r\nsweep of our actions. Through the habits of cooperation and\r\ntrust that it engenders among its Members and among the\r\ncountless individuals and institutions that participate in its\r\ndialogues, we might yet realize our shared vision of a\r\nglobal civil society. But first it must be reformed, further\r\ndemocratized and fully empowered.\r\nThe United Nations, as the central mechanism and\r\ncatalyst for multilateral cooperation, must be enabled to\r\nplay its mandated role in the achievement and maintenance\r\nof peace, security and development. It is therefore of the\r\ngreatest importance that it be provided with the resources\r\nwith which to carry on its work instead of being strapped\r\nfor funds as it is now. The legal obligation of every\r\nMember State in that regard must therefore be strictly met.\r\nIt is also essential that the ongoing process of reform\r\nof the United Nations be intensified, particularly with\r\nregard to the Security Council, taking into account the\r\ndesire of all States from all regions to participate in its\r\nwork, as well as present political, economic and\r\ndemographic realities. For indeed, developing countries\r\nare grossly under-represented on the Council especially at\r\na time when its work is focused on conflict situations in\r\nthe developing world. This anomaly has to be redressed\r\nby an increase in the representation of the developing\r\nworld in the permanent as well as in the non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Council. The legitimacy, credibility\r\nand effectiveness of the Council’s work depend on its\r\nrepresentative character. Indonesia views the task of\r\nSecurity Council reform as a matter of urgency, but we\r\nmust not be rushed into any hasty or ill-advised decisions\r\nthat would be detrimental to the long-term interests of\r\nMember States. In this context, there is a need to continue\r\nand accelerate the work of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council.\r\nIf the cause of disarmament, particularly nuclear\r\ndisarmament, has not made substantive progress in recent\r\nyears, it is largely because there are States that believe\r\nthey have much to gain by their exclusive possession of\r\nnuclear arms. The unjustifiable privileges conferred on the\r\nnuclear-weapon States have given rise to a regime of\r\ndiscrimination and hypocrisy as well as a situation where\r\nnon-nuclear countries wishing to enjoy the same\r\nprivileges seek to become nuclear States themselves.\r\nThus, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) has not fully met its objectives, and the\r\nimbalances and discrimination inherent to it have\r\npersisted. Regrettably, too, the second Preparatory\r\nCommittee for the 2000 Review Conference failed to\r\nagree on substantive issues. Still, we must persevere and\r\nprepare ourselves for the next NPT Review Conference\r\nand focus on the inequities and imbalances inherent in the\r\nTreaty. At the same time, we urge the nuclear-weapon\r\nStates to implement faithfully both the letter and spirit of\r\nagreements relating to non-proliferation and nuclear\r\ndisarmament. We call on all States to refrain from\r\ndeveloping these weapons so that we may the sooner\r\nattain our ultimate objective of their total elimination.\r\nThe slow pace of progress towards non-proliferation\r\nand nuclear disarmament compels us to work even harder\r\nto achieve global disarmament objectives. The convening\r\nof the fourth special session of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to disarmament is essential for providing new\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\npolitical momentum that would enable and encourage the\r\nGovernments and peoples of the world to move towards\r\ndisarmament, including the elimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nIt is therefore imperative that we take further concrete steps\r\nleading to the convening of the fourth special session.\r\nWhile disarmament marks time, discord is rampant in\r\nthe form of armed conflicts, disputes and tensions between\r\nand within States in many parts of the globe. The situation\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a source of continuing\r\nconcern for Indonesia. Hence, we reaffirm our steadfast\r\nsupport for the full, impartial and effective implementation\r\nof the Dayton Peace Agreement. In Afghanistan, we call on\r\nthe warring factions to cease hostilities and to start\r\nconstructive dialogue. The protracted civil strife in that\r\ncountry also threatens to spill over beyond its borders. We\r\nurge the parties concerned to cooperate with the United\r\nNations in its concerted endeavours to restore peace and\r\nstability in the region. The dire situation in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo calls for continued and concerted\r\nefforts in restoring peace and tranquillity.\r\nIndonesia is appalled by the terrorist bomb attacks on\r\nthe American embassies in the capitals of Kenya and\r\nTanzania that caused the death of nearly 200 people and the\r\nwounding of thousands. We reiterate our condemnation of\r\nall acts and forms of terrorism wherever they may occur\r\nand whoever perpetrates them. At the same time, we stress\r\nthat we will never condone the resort to unilateral acts of\r\naggression and violation of the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of States as a means to combat terrorism. We\r\ntherefore urge all States to enhance international\r\ncooperation in the fight against terrorism while strictly\r\nobserving and implementing the relevant international\r\ninstruments.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the recent positive\r\ndevelopments concerning the Lockerbie incident that\r\nculminated in the adoption of Security Council resolution\r\n1192 (1998). It is our hope that discussions will now take\r\nplace between the United Kingdom, the United States and\r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including on the appropriate\r\ntrial arrangements. Early implementation of this resolution\r\nwill hopefully lead to a definitive settlement of this issue\r\nand the lifting of sanctions imposed on Libya.\r\nIn the Middle East, the situation in the occupied\r\nterritories keeps deteriorating as the peace process remains\r\nin the grip of a stalemate. Israeli policies and practices of\r\noppression and provocation have continued unabated. In a\r\nblatant attempt to change the demography of the occupied\r\nterritories, Israel keeps building new settlements and\r\nexpanding existing ones. More ominously, it has\r\narbitrarily extended the administrative powers of the\r\noccupying authorities in Jerusalem beyond the city’s\r\nborders in a bid to consolidate Israel’s hold on East\r\nJerusalem and the West Bank and thereby entrench\r\nJerusalem as its capital. This would pre-empt negotiations\r\non the status of the Holy City and threaten to unravel the\r\npeace process, with grave repercussions not only for the\r\nMiddle East but also beyond.\r\nPeace and stability will continue to elude the region\r\nuntil Israel complies with its treaty obligations and\r\nunconditionally withdraws from all occupied Arab\r\nterritories in accordance with all relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions, in particular 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\r\n(1978). The peace process must be resumed and\r\nagreements reached must be implemented in their entirety\r\nand not selectively or conditionally.\r\nIn South-East Asia, the elections held recently in\r\nCambodia, deemed to have been generally free and fair\r\nby international observers, should now lead to the\r\nrestoration of normalcy in the country. It is time that all\r\nthe parties in Cambodia resolve their differences in the\r\nspirit of national reconciliation and unity in the larger\r\ninterest of their country, work together toward the\r\nformation of a new government and thereby contribute to\r\npeace and stability in South-East Asia.\r\nThe world economy is teetering on the brink of\r\nrecession, if not already experiencing one. Economic\r\noutput has slowed for the developed and developing\r\ncountries alike, and growth in world trade has also\r\ndecelerated. While official forecasts indicate a slowdown\r\nin the growth of world output to 2.5 per cent, any such\r\nforecasts may still be too optimistic. Only a little more\r\nthan a year ago, the world economy was on a significant\r\ngrowth path, and the outlook was generally bright. In\r\nAsia, robust growth for decades had transformed much of\r\nthe region into an economic powerhouse. Today, many of\r\nthose dynamic economies are crippled. One third of the\r\nworld is grappling with serious economic slowdown and\r\nthe frightening possibility of a depression.\r\nIn the affected countries, including Indonesia,\r\neconomic turmoil has reached a devastating level, pushing\r\ntheir economies into recession and their people to the\r\nvery edge of their endurance. Unemployment has soared,\r\nand an unacceptable number of people have slipped under\r\nthe poverty line. Education has been severely affected,\r\nand food is in short supply. The experience of South-East\r\nAsian countries in this financial turmoil has shown that\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\neven the most dynamic economies are vulnerable. In spite\r\nof the judicious macroeconomic policies that they adopted\r\nand the often painful structural adjustments that they carried\r\nout, the development gains they earned over the decades\r\ncrumbled in the span of a few weeks. The lesson of this\r\ndebacle is that the market is driven by sentiments as much\r\nas fundamentals, by perception rather than facts alone.\r\nThese adverse aspects of globalization have\r\nfurthermore greatly eroded multilateral cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. The concept of development as a special part\r\nof a multilateral support system has been largely replaced\r\nby the laissez-faire approach to the globalized economy.\r\nThis has resulted, inter alia, in sharply contracted financial\r\nresources for development for the majority of the\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed\r\ncountries. External indebtedness has escalated, and\r\nprotectionism in international trade has risen significantly\r\nas more and more countries have become inward-looking in\r\nthis era of globalization.\r\nThis dire situation will certainly impact on the\r\nimplementation of the commitments agreed upon at the\r\nrecent major global conferences, including in the fields of\r\nenvironment and development, social development,\r\npopulation and development, women and development,\r\nhabitat and food. It is therefore a matter of great concern to\r\nall of us that the achievement of sustainable human\r\ndevelopment will be further removed from reality.\r\nI believe that our troubles are less the result of the\r\nvagaries of globalization than the consequence of an\r\neconomic doctrine that has dominated international\r\neconomic relations for many years now. This doctrine\r\npresents unbridled liberalization as a panacea for all\r\neconomies, developed and developing. In their desire to\r\nintegrate themselves with the global economy, many\r\ndeveloping countries have audaciously opened up their\r\neconomies, only to realize that the social and political costs\r\nof doing so often outstrip the benefits. Moreover, the\r\ninordinate emphasis on unfettered markets has led to the\r\nneglect of such development issues as international\r\ncooperation for development, the need for non-commercial\r\nfinancial flows and the necessity of differential treatment\r\nfor developing countries. Thus, the international agenda has\r\nbeen governed by the interests of the developed countries\r\nin opening up opportunities for foreign investments, private\r\ncapital flows — that often turn out to be merely\r\nspeculative — and the export of their manufactures.\r\nIn the face of such stark global realities, we must\r\nintensify international solidarity and cooperation. The\r\ninternational community should strengthen its\r\nmanagement role in the world economy, in particular in\r\nthe monetary and financial fields, including the\r\nestablishment of surveillance and regulatory frameworks\r\nfor short-term capital flows and trade in currencies,\r\nwithout constraining the liberalization of economies. This\r\nstrengthened international management role is essential if\r\nwe seek to avert future crises, alleviate the adverse impact\r\nof globalization and maximize its benefits.\r\nWe should therefore seriously consider various\r\ninitiatives for enhancing global financial and monetary\r\ncooperation. The proposed United Nations conference on\r\nfinancing for development would provide an opportunity\r\nto explore various options towards financial stability and\r\ndevelopment. It is also encouraging that the two-day high-\r\nlevel dialogue of the General Assembly last week\r\ncontributed to increased awareness and understanding of\r\nthe economic and social impact of globalization and the\r\nneed for international cooperation in addressing that issue.\r\nAnother important proposal is the one made by the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement for an international conference\r\non money and finance for development in order to pursue\r\ncomprehensive reform of the existing international\r\nmonetary and financial system.\r\nBecause we want the North-South dialogue to\r\nproceed in earnest, we should broaden and intensify\r\nSouth-South cooperation. Decades of development efforts\r\nhave greatly increased the economic complementarities\r\namong developing countries. We must tap these\r\ncomplementarities and strengthen partnership in the South.\r\nIn this effort, our developed-country partners and\r\ninternational institutions can play a valuable role by\r\nparticipating in tripartite arrangements. In this regard, a\r\nnumber of steps to promote South-South cooperation have\r\nbeen initiated, including a high-level meeting on regional\r\nand subregional cooperation, which will be held in Bali,\r\nIndonesia, this coming December. The commemoration of\r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Buenos\r\nAires Plan of Action on South-South cooperation will be\r\nheld at a special one-day meeting in the General\r\nAssembly. Of great importance is the Group of 77\r\ninitiative on a South summit to be held prior to the\r\nMillennium Assembly, in the year 2000.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which was\r\nproclaimed as a common standard of achievement for all\r\npeoples and all nations. To us in Indonesia who are now\r\nin the midst of formulating and initiating far-reaching\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\neconomic, social and political reforms, this is a particularly\r\nsignificant occasion. In fact, in line with our commitment\r\nto the Vienna Declaration, we have just launched a National\r\nPlan of Action on Human Rights aimed at infusing the\r\nvarious segments of society and of the Government,\r\nincluding the national security apparatus, with values\r\nconducive to the promotion and protection of human rights.\r\nWe expect to sign and ratify in the near future several more\r\nUnited Nations conventions on human rights.\r\nThe reform-development Government that is now in\r\nplace in Indonesia will carry out vigorous measures to\r\nfurther democratize our national life. For we know very\r\nwell that our economic recovery will basically have to be\r\ndriven by confidence, on the part of the international\r\ncommunity as well as on the part of our own citizens, in\r\nour own system of governance.\r\nIn the face of the challenges of our time, we in\r\nIndonesia will rebuild and refine the institutions that will\r\nmake the laws of economics work for our society. At the\r\ninternational level, I believe that it is also necessary to\r\nbuild and refine the institutions that will make global\r\neconomics work for all nations, whether developed or\r\ndeveloping.\r\nGlobalization is not the demon that has been menacing\r\nour prospects for the future. But for too long we have\r\naccepted doctrines formulated and waved in the name of\r\nliberalization. The most perceptive economists of our day\r\nhave been pointing out that error, and we must now heed\r\nthem. Globalization and liberalization never required us to\r\nmerely compete in dancing to the tune of the market place.\r\nIt never told us to stop cooperating with one another. But\r\nmany of us were enchanted with the gospel of unfettered\r\nlaissez-faire until it was seen that the contagion of a\r\nfinancial crisis in one developing country in one corner of\r\nthe globe could plunge the entire world into depression.\r\nNow it is clear — if it was not sufficiently clear\r\nbefore — that we are stewards of one another’s welfare,\r\nthat we must extend a hand to every brother and sister who\r\nfalters, or in the course of globalization none of us,\r\ndeveloped or developing, will see salvation. Human destiny\r\nis indivisible. Let us never forget that again.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic): I\r\nnow give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nCosta Rica, His Excellency Mr. Roberto Rojas.\r\nMr. Rojas (Costa Rica) (interpretation from Spanish):\r\nCosta Rica is extremely pleased at Mr. Didier Opertti’s\r\nelection to preside over the work of this fifty-third session\r\nof the General Assembly. We say this not just as the\r\nritual greeting required by protocol, but as an expression\r\nof our deeply felt congratulations to a gifted citizen of the\r\nAmericas and as an expression of our certainty that in this\r\nposition the noble qualities you have displayed as a great\r\njurist in the inter-American system and as the\r\ndistinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sister\r\nRepublic of Uruguay will once again be shown.\r\nIn presenting our respectful greetings to the\r\nSecretary-General, my delegation also wishes to express\r\nits sincere recognition of the enormously courageous\r\nefforts he has made in the Secretariat in favour of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, as well as\r\nhis efforts to renew and modernize the United Nations.\r\nCosta Rica congratulates you, Sir, for your work and\r\nencourages you to continue in your endeavours, which do\r\nhonour to Ghana and to Africa.\r\nWe are approaching the twenty-first century, the\r\nthird millennium of our era, at a dizzying speed. In a few\r\nyears, all of us here will be men and women of the past\r\ncentury. Nevertheless, we have the obligation to bestow\r\nupon the new millennium a world of greater solidarity.\r\nThis subject calls for reflection. What have we done so\r\nfar, and most of all, what are we doing about the\r\nimminent future? What positive contributions can we\r\nmake to the new horizon that is opening up in the annals\r\nof history?\r\nUndoubtedly, the very existence of the United\r\nNations constitutes a most positive element. In 1945, this\r\nOrganization emerged as a successor, on a larger scale, to\r\nthe ideal of peace embodied in the League of Nations.\r\nThe 51 countries represented in San Francisco aspired to\r\nbuild a world in which harmony would prevail and where\r\ninternational security would be supported by a far more\r\nsolid foundation. Today, in this Hall, almost all the\r\ncountries of the world are represented — we hope that in\r\nthe near future there will be no exceptions — and each of\r\nthem has taken upon itself the obligation to abide by the\r\npurposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter.\r\nUnder the vigorous leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt,\r\nthe members of the Commission on Human Rights of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council worked untiringly, freely\r\nand openly discussing the subject, and trying to\r\nharmonize approaches that encompassed both Western\r\nhumanism and the ancient philosophy of the East. The\r\nfruit of their efforts was the adoption, on 10 December\r\n1948, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nDuring those bitter years, when the shadows left by\r\nthe worldwide conflagration had not yet cleared, and those\r\nof the bipolar confrontation were already looming, some\r\nbelieved that the Declaration was a pleasant, romantic and\r\nentirely unrealistic suggestion.\r\nOthers saw it, on the contrary, as our species’ best\r\nhope, in the conviction that international relations have\r\nethical value only insofar as they guarantee the dignity of\r\nhuman beings, which is our very essence as rational\r\ncreatures, through respect for our natural attributes. As the\r\nformer President of Chile, Mr. Eduardo Frei Montalva once\r\nstated, the ratification of the Declaration was a\r\ndemonstration of faith in peace, faith in the peoples of the\r\nworld and faith in moral progress.\r\nI am proud to be able to say that Costa Rica\r\nenthusiastically supported the Declaration; since then, Costa\r\nRica has expressed its firm belief that human rights cannot\r\nbe subordinated to the interests of States. Today our\r\ncountry is the seat of the Inter-American Court of Human\r\nRights, the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights, and\r\nthe University for Peace of the United Nations. Throughout\r\nCosta Rica’s history as a Member of the United Nations, it\r\nhas consistently been committed to the cause of human\r\nrights, in both the international arena and the domestic\r\nsphere.\r\nOn this occasion, I reiterate to the Assembly all Costa\r\nRica’s firm, solemn and unconditional commitment to\r\ncontinue fighting actively, whenever and wherever, to\r\nachieve full respect for all human rights.\r\nToday my country reaffirms that its voice will\r\ncontinue to be heard in all forums on behalf of the noble\r\nethical and moral ideals that we proclaimed 50 years ago.\r\nPerhaps the most important legacy that the United\r\nNations of the twentieth century will leave to the United\r\nNations of the twenty-first century will be the certitude that\r\nhuman rights are a matter of universal concern. This\r\nconviction has allowed the broad conceptual, legal and\r\npolitical development of the subject of human rights. We\r\nhave debated and signed pacts, conventions and protocols\r\non increasingly specific aspects of human rights.\r\nDespite this prodigious pile of legal instruments,\r\nhumanity is still very far from having inscribed human\r\nrights on its very spirit. In many aspects, the commitment\r\nto an ethic of coexistence is as absent from the events of\r\ntoday as it was half a century ago.\r\nCosta Rica observes with regret the instances of\r\nintolerance and violence that still persist in our world, the\r\nethnic, religious, cultural, national, ideological or gender\r\ndiscrimination: the conflicts in the Balkans, the tragic\r\nwars endured by some African peoples, the situation in\r\nAfghanistan and the savagery of terrorism in various parts\r\nof the world. We are extremely concerned by the limited\r\nprogress of the Middle East peace process and the\r\nincreasing virulence of national extremism and religious\r\nfanaticism in certain countries.\r\nMy country believes that these serious problems\r\nmust be faced from an ethical standpoint, with the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights as the basic code\r\nfor the conduct of both States and individuals.\r\nThe legal validity of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights is no longer debated today. However, for\r\na long time, doubts and objections were raised as to the\r\npossibility of establishing mechanisms to guarantee it.\r\nThanks to the efforts of many years, the United\r\nNations now has a High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights. My country is proud to have been one of the main\r\nsponsors of the establishment of that office.\r\nOne of the most important events that has taken\r\nplace this year was the successful culmination of the\r\neffort to establish an International Criminal Court.\r\nThe valuable experience of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia — of which\r\nthe Second Vice-President of Costa Rica, Judge Elizabeth\r\nOdio, is a member — undoubtedly contributed to\r\nstrengthening the conviction on the need for a permanent\r\ncourt to try the most serious violations of human rights.\r\nMy country embraces the adoption of the Statute of\r\nthe International Criminal Court, which took place in\r\nRome on 17 July of this year, whereby the international\r\ncommunity rejects and condemns the most heinous crimes\r\nagainst our universal conscience. We are especially\r\npleased that the Rome Conference included within its\r\ndefinition of crimes violations of the basic norms of\r\ninternational humanitarian law, applicable both to\r\ninternational and internal conflicts. In addition, in the\r\nlight of the tragic experiences of some Latin American\r\ncountries in the recent past, we are gratified by the\r\ninclusion of the legal definition of forced disappearance.\r\nI am pleased to announce that, in the coming days,\r\nI will have the honour of signing the Court’s Statute on\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nbehalf of my country, and I express Costa Rica’s firm\r\nintention to proceed with its speedy approval and\r\nratification.\r\nMy country is convinced of the necessity to establish\r\na commission that will prepare, before the year 2000, the\r\nessential conditions for the Statute to enter into force. Costa\r\nRica believes that the commission should be convened as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nThis year, in addition to celebrating the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\r\nmy country will celebrate another anniversary which, for\r\nCosta Ricans, is no less important: the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the abolition of the Costa Rican army, decreed on 1\r\nDecember 1948. Only 10 days later, Costa Rica adopted the\r\nMagna Carta of international ethics, the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\r\nThe abolition of the army was the culmination of my\r\ncountry’s long anti-militaristic history. In 1866, the then\r\nPresident of Costa Rica, Mr. José María Castro, stated that\r\none of the foundations of external peace is a strict\r\nadherence to international law, among whose prescriptions,\r\nas listed by President Castro, are dignity, good faith, loyalty\r\nand frankness. Today, as then, my country believes that in\r\norder to invoke international law and aspire to be a\r\nrespected and valued State without need of military support,\r\nCosta Rica’s principal duty is to govern its domestic and\r\ninternational conduct by a system of values that is grounded\r\nin the fundamental rights of individuals.\r\nAs a result of its historical and moral tradition, Costa\r\nRica believes that there are no small countries when it\r\ncomes to consolidating and preserving peace. Such has been\r\nCosta Rica’s rule of conduct when it has had the\r\nopportunity, as it does now, to be a member of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nFor this same reason, Costa Rica has tenaciously\r\nsupported the work aimed at general disarmament, and in\r\nparticular the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction,\r\nand has vigorously condemned the carrying out of nuclear\r\ntests. In that regard, my country urges all those States that\r\nhave not yet done so to adhere fully and unconditionally to\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nBecause of the values that have emerged from its own\r\nexperience, Costa Rica has invariably repudiated terrorism\r\nin all its manifestations, wherever and by whomever it is\r\ncommitted. We do not believe that there is any justification\r\nfor attacks against innocent people. Likewise, we condemn\r\nthose Governments that support, shelter and give\r\nassistance to those who commit or instigate terrorist acts,\r\nin clear violation of their international obligations.\r\nWe believe that the international community must\r\nmake special efforts to prevent and eliminate international\r\nterrorism. In this context, we stress the recent negotiations\r\non an International Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings, and we urge Member States to sign\r\nit. We also trust that during this session of the General\r\nAssembly decisive progress can be made on the\r\npreparation of an international convention for the\r\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. My delegation\r\nwishes to express how deeply pleased it is that the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\r\nTheir Destruction is to enter into force within six months.\r\nMy country urges all those States that have not yet done\r\nso to accede to that Convention as soon as possible.\r\nWe are pleased to see that in Central America —\r\nnotwithstanding the conflicts and the turmoil that our\r\ncountries faced during the last decade — there are signs\r\nof progress towards the elimination or substantial\r\nreduction of military expenditures. Some countries have\r\neliminated their armed forces, and others have reduced\r\nthem significantly. Costa Rica does not intend to either\r\nexport or impose any models on others, but it warmly\r\napplauds the decision of these brother countries.\r\nThe international community should acknowledge the\r\nspecific progress that has been made in reducing military\r\nexpenses by developing countries. In this spirit, Costa\r\nRica wishes to propose the creation of a special fund for\r\nCentral America, which would be established through\r\ncontributions of developed countries and organizations.\r\nThe idea would be that each dollar not spent on military\r\nbudgets would be at least matched by contributions for\r\nsocial development programmes to strengthen democratic\r\nsystems in our region.\r\nThe Central American peace process has been one of\r\nthe most successful ones of recent times. Only a decade\r\nago, in this same Hall, we were exhausting ourselves\r\ndiscussing and commenting on the effects of the Central\r\nAmerican crisis. Today, our countries rarely make the\r\nheadlines of the international press. However, we would\r\nlike to stress that, notwithstanding Central America’s huge\r\nsocial and economical problems, it resolutely continues to\r\nwork to consolidate for its children a more dignified and\r\nfreer way of life, more in accordance with the spirit of\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nprogressed in the areas of electoral democracy and freedom\r\nof expression. Now the time has come to consolidate\r\nparticipatory democracy. Therefore, at the end of this\r\ncentury and of the millennium, Costa Rica has begun a\r\nprocess of national political dialogue, with broad popular\r\nparticipation, in order to strengthen our more than 100-year-\r\nold democracy.\r\nThe Central American countries have worked\r\nstrenuously for the integration and liberalization of our\r\neconomies. We have achieved important progress in our\r\nintegration mechanisms and structural adjustment processes.\r\nWe are participating actively in the negotiations aimed at\r\ncreating a free-trade area throughout the Americas, and we\r\ncontinue to maintain a policy of openness and commercial\r\nlinks among the Latin American countries.\r\nDespite the regional efforts to redraft its economic\r\nplans and to adapt them to the world market’s requirements,\r\nCosta Rica views with apprehension the creation of\r\neconomic unions or commercial blocks that beget new\r\ndiscrimination against third countries. Similarly, new\r\nconditionalities in the commercial policy of the\r\nindustrialized economies and the use of managed-trade\r\nmechanisms are a clear impediment to the ideal of free\r\ntrade and create new inequalities of access to the world\r\neconomy.\r\nAt the same time, we observe that, while the global\r\ntrade in raw materials and agricultural products is losing its\r\nvigour, the exchange of high-technology goods is growing\r\nstronger. This means that the portion of trade traditionally\r\ncarried out by the developing countries is becoming weaker\r\nin the global context. In this regard, Costa Rica urges the\r\nopening of markets, not only of the small economies, but\r\nalso of the large and industrialized economies. Costa Rica\r\nalso advocates commitment to the ideal of free trade that\r\ngave birth to the World Trade Organization and respect for\r\nits rules and resolutions in order to create an international\r\nenvironment more propitious for developing countries’\r\neconomic progress.\r\nFree trade encourages economic growth, and economic\r\nfreedom encourages the creation of wealth within the\r\nnations. In accordance with these principles, my country\r\nundertook, in 1997, the chairmanship of the negotiating\r\nprocess for the free-trade zone of the Americas, and we are\r\ntrying to contribute dynamically to its progress.\r\nWe are also making efforts to attain fair and non-\r\ndiscriminatory access for Central American products to\r\nmarkets in the United States and the European Union —\r\nthe region’s principal trade partners. In both markets, our\r\ncountries have been negatively affected by the diversion\r\nof trade and investment that have resulted from the\r\ngranting of preferential concessions to third countries,\r\nwhich are displacing our main exports. We refute the neo-\r\nprotectionist arguments of the groups who are trying to\r\nobstruct the access of Central American products to those\r\nmarkets. For this reason, we are promoting the\r\nstrengthening of the Caribbean Basin Initiative in order to\r\ncorrect those diversions and inequities. Furthermore, we\r\nbelieve there should be better opportunities for our\r\nexports to the European Union through its generalized\r\npreferences system. We are also promoting tariff\r\nreduction for agricultural products in all the industrialized\r\ncountries.\r\nAt the same time, Costa Rica urges industrialized\r\nnations to cooperate with the efforts to strengthen the\r\ninternational financial institutions in order to ensure the\r\nstability of the world financial system. Institutions such as\r\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and\r\nregional entities such as the Inter-American Development\r\nBank must provide support to overcome the crises that\r\ncause financial instability, especially in the emerging\r\nmarkets.\r\nWhile some believe that economic profit and ethics\r\nhave nothing to do with each other, experience has shown\r\nus otherwise. Capitalism without rule of law and not\r\nsubject to ethical rules usually causes scourges such as\r\nthe spread of drug-trafficking, the reign of organized\r\ncrime and corruption.\r\nMy country, like many others, has been affected by\r\nthese phenomena. Mr. Miguel Angel Rodríguez\r\nEcheverría, President of Costa Rica, is actively\r\nparticipating in both the fight against and the prevention\r\nof these scourges, and he gave proof of his commitment\r\nto this cause when he contributed to the success of the\r\nrecent special session of the General Assembly on drug-\r\ntrafficking. For Costa Rica, these struggles can be won\r\nonly if they have a solid ethical foundation. Genuine\r\nethical leadership can do more for the long-lasting and\r\nsustainable prosperity of a society than the best laws and\r\nthe most detailed treaties.\r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not\r\nonly a statement of rights, it is also a clear statement of\r\nevery human being’s duties to the community. One of the\r\nfundamental obligations of all persons is to behave\r\nfraternally with their fellow men and the environment.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nCosta Rica has not been exempt from the problems\r\ncaused by environmental degradation. However, my\r\ncountry’s authorities and many organizations of our civil\r\nsociety are working strenuously to solve them. In a\r\nrelatively short time, we Costa Ricans have achieved major\r\nprogress in the task of recovering and preserving our rich\r\nbiodiversity, while at the same time transforming it into a\r\nsource of income. For example, Costa Rica is today one of\r\nthe developing countries that has undertaken a leading role\r\nin carbon-fixation projects. We have negotiated important\r\nbilateral agreements based on the filtration capability of our\r\nforests. Those agreements have allowed us to become the\r\nfirst country to issue “sale of oxygen” certificates as\r\nspecific proof of the quantity of captured emissions.\r\nMy country has been the recipient of important\r\ninternational cooperation programmes. In many areas we\r\ncontinue needing them. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that\r\ncooperation is a two-way street in which we can all teach\r\nand learn, give and receive. Costa Rica believes that its\r\nexperience in ecological matters may be useful to many\r\nother countries and it makes it available to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nFurthermore, my country would like to express its firm\r\nintention to offer technical cooperation for development, in\r\nthe modest measure of its capabilities, through the action of\r\na specialized office that is being established for such a\r\npurpose. Thanks to this office, Costa Ricans will share with\r\nother nations our experiences in the areas of health,\r\neducation, ecology, human rights and electoral\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFor Costa Rica, the respect for diversity consecrated\r\nin the Universal Declaration must be an essential\r\ncharacteristic of the Member States of the United Nations.\r\nIn this regard, we are always conscious of the valuable\r\nlesson of the African thinker, Salif Tall Tierno-Bokar, when\r\nhe taught that the rainbow owes its beauty to the varied\r\ntones of its colours in the same way that the voices of\r\nvarious believers make up a harmony that rises up to\r\ndivinity.\r\nThe survival of the human species cannot be based on\r\na system of separate existences. Since human beings first\r\nappeared on the face of the earth, they must have had an\r\nawareness of their individual limitations and must have\r\nunderstood that they could not survive without the other\r\nmembers of their species. Today, such natural wisdom of\r\nour far-distant ancestors continues to be valid. We must live\r\nin community in order to build the future.\r\nThe concept of love for our fellow men is at the\r\ncore of all religions. The ancient texts of the great\r\nmasters of China, Mexico and India, and the Torah, the\r\nGospel and the Koran, regardless of any differences, are\r\nall permeated with a deep sense of identity among\r\nindividuals.\r\nMoral and spiritual perfection, the dream of so many\r\nthinkers and the innermost aspiration of so many peoples,\r\ncannot be reached without a basis in the constructive and\r\nfraternal coexistence of all the nations.\r\nAt this moment in history, we the people who\r\ninhabit the earth must create a civilization of peace and\r\nsolidarity. The twenty-first century should be the century\r\nof the culture of peace, which is also the culture of\r\nfreedom, tolerance and solidarity.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Knut VollebÆk.\r\nMr. VollebÆk (Norway): This year we are\r\ncelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. In our global community,\r\nthe issue of human rights is the concern of us all. For this\r\nreason the Government of Norway welcomes the fact that\r\nhuman rights are now being given increased priority in\r\nthe work of the United Nations. Adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of a declaration on human rights defenders on\r\nthe International Human Rights Day, on 10 December,\r\nwould represent proof of our strong commitment in this\r\nfield.\r\nHuman rights is basically about human dignity —\r\nabout protecting the individual against oppression and\r\nexploitation, poverty and injustice, marginalization and\r\ndegradation. The struggle for civil and political rights and\r\nfor social, economic and cultural rights must be one and\r\nthe same struggle. When we address breaches of civil and\r\npolitical rights, we must also address the issues of\r\ndevelopment and poverty.\r\nAs a new millennium is upon us, one of our most\r\nfundamental challenges is the realization of a humane\r\nworld. This must be more than a vision. It is a moral\r\nimperative. All Governments endeavouring to implement\r\nand promote respect for human rights in their societies\r\ndeserve our wholehearted support. Democracy,\r\ntransparency and good governance are essential for\r\neconomic growth, sustainable development and political\r\nstability. Governments that continue to disregard basic\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nhuman rights norms deprive their populations not only of\r\npolitical freedom, but also of improved economic\r\nconditions.\r\nThe pursuit of a humane world requires new\r\napproaches. And new tools. A good example of this\r\napproach is the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which was\r\nnegotiated in Oslo. With the ratification by Burkina Faso,\r\npresently chairing the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU), as the fortieth country, the Ottawa process has in\r\nless than two years produced a binding international legal\r\ninstrument which will enter into force early next year. This\r\nhas been made possible by a new diplomacy reaching\r\nbeyond relations between States to engage individuals and\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nOur efforts to rid the world of the scourge of anti-\r\npersonnel mines must be intensified so that we can reach\r\nthe objectives set out in the Ottawa process. Norway has\r\nalready made a commitment of $120 million over a five-\r\nyear period to mine action programmes, including\r\nassistance to mine victims. We call on other Governments\r\nto join in this endeavour. The United Nations has a central\r\nrole to play in these efforts.\r\nThe partnership between Governments, international\r\norganizations and civil society demonstrated throughout the\r\nOttawa process should be pursued in our new drive to\r\nrestrict proliferation of small arms and light weapons. In\r\nrecent years it has become evident that small arms are a\r\nformidable barrier to ending violent conflicts and\r\nconsolidating peace, political stability and reconstruction of\r\nwar-torn societies. We need to intensify and harmonize our\r\nefforts to combat the illegal trade in and proliferation of\r\nsuch arms, which account for most casualties in today’s\r\nconflicts.\r\nNorway has committed considerable resources to\r\nimmediate action to assist populations in war-torn societies.\r\nWe support demobilization and arms collection programmes\r\nin a number of countries, and we have raised the question\r\nof what role United Nations peacekeeping operations could\r\nplay in these areas. To further strengthen these efforts,\r\nNorway proposes the establishment of a trust fund to\r\ncombat the widespread proliferation and illegal use of small\r\narms, in particular through the collection and destruction of\r\nsuch weapons at the end of armed conflicts. Norway will\r\npledge 15 million Norwegian kroner (NKr) — about $2\r\nmillion — to the establishment of such a trust fund and\r\ncalls on other countries to follow suit. We propose that the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) be\r\ncharged with the management of the fund.\r\nNorway is gravely concerned by the recent\r\nunderground nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. I would\r\nlike to emphasize the crucial importance of both the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) for international efforts to prevent the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and achieve nuclear\r\ndisarmament. Therefore, Norway urges all countries to\r\njoin the NPT and the CTBT. We believe the United\r\nNations should serve as an important forum for\r\nstrengthened dialogue and exchange of information on\r\nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament and that it\r\nshould contribute to more transparency and confidence in\r\nthese crucial matters.\r\nThe current world economic crisis clearly illustrates\r\nthat we are all part of a single global economy. It also\r\nillustrates that we are far from fully understanding the\r\npowerful forces of globalization, and even further from\r\nbeing able to adequately manage them. The international\r\nfinancial crisis has led to soaring unemployment,\r\nplummeting living standards and shattered expectations of\r\na better life for millions of people.\r\nWe clearly need a better understanding and better\r\nmanagement of the global economy. My Government\r\nshares the serious concern expressed by the recent summit\r\nmeeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban. While\r\nthe process of globalization has led to greater economic\r\nopportunities for many, a large number of developing\r\ncountries are being left even further behind in the wake\r\nof the increasing integration of the world economy.\r\nAs was pointed out during last week’s high-level meeting\r\non globalization and development here at the United\r\nNations, there is no alternative to multilateral cooperation\r\nefforts if we are to maximize the positive effects of\r\nglobalization, while minimizing its negative aspects.\r\nWhile our planet is shrinking, the income gap\r\ncontinues to grow — between as well as within nations.\r\nAt the same time, we are experiencing a steep reduction\r\nin official development aid from North to South. It is a\r\nregrettable fact that the industrialized countries are\r\nincreasingly distancing themselves from the agreed United\r\nNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product\r\nfor development purposes.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nDeveloped and developing countries alike are accusing\r\neach other of broken promises and failure to live up to their\r\ncommitments. What we need is a new partnership based on\r\nresult-oriented policies in developing countries and a\r\ncommitment on the part of the developed countries to reach\r\nthe 0.7 per cent target within an agreed time-frame.\r\nNorway, which has been well above this target for decades,\r\nis actively seeking to counter the growing donor fatigue and\r\nintends to further increase its official development\r\nassistance in the years ahead.\r\nMany of our most pressing problems are international\r\nin nature and global in scope. International crime and\r\nterrorism, environmental degradation and the spread of\r\ndisease do not need passports to cross borders. They are\r\nglobal problems, requiring global solutions.\r\nAs the world changes, so must the United Nations. We\r\nhave previously commended the Secretary-General for his\r\nreform agenda. Much has already been done. It is now up\r\nto us, the Member States, to promote the reform process\r\nthroughout the whole United Nations system.\r\nWe cannot ask the United Nations to do more and\r\nperform better, while at the same time cutting back on its\r\nresources. As a very minimum, all Member States must\r\nhonour their legal commitments and pay their dues in full,\r\non time and without conditions.\r\nFor the poorest and most heavily indebted developing\r\ncountries, the debt problem represents one of the main\r\nobstacles to development. Urgent action is needed to end\r\nthe unsustainable debt burden of these countries. Norway\r\nfor its part will launch a comprehensive national debt relief\r\nstrategy. The strategy will form the basis for our policy for\r\nsupporting and strengthening the international debt relief\r\nschemes. It will also contain additional debt reduction\r\nmeasures on a bilateral basis which will be applied on top\r\nof the reductions made under multilateral operations.\r\nNo investments yield a higher return than investments\r\nin basic social services — in primary health and education.\r\nSince the World Social Summit, Norway has actively\r\nadvocated the 20/20 principle. This calls for a mutual\r\ncommitment between developed and developing countries\r\nto allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance\r\nand 20 per cent of national budgets, respectively, to basic\r\nsocial programmes. We encourage all countries to adhere to\r\nthis target.\r\nEconomic growth and social development underpin\r\npolitical stability. But political stability and good\r\ngovernance are also prerequisites for sustained economic\r\ndevelopment. While the United Nations should retain its\r\nvital role in economic, environmental and social affairs,\r\nthe Organization must also involve itself more extensively\r\nin conflict prevention, crisis management and peace-\r\nbuilding efforts. In two weeks’ time we will be\r\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. The United Nations has proved\r\nindispensable for maintaining stability, peace and security\r\nfor millions of people, for which it was awarded the\r\nNobel Peace Prize 10 years ago. At this juncture, we\r\npledge our continued support for the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping endeavours. The Organization’s capacity\r\nmust be further enhanced, not least with regard to rapid\r\nresponse to armed conflicts.\r\nIn particular, we wish to honour those who have\r\ngiven their lives under the United Nations flag. The\r\nincreasing number of casualties among United Nations\r\npersonnel on missions abroad has made us more aware of\r\nthe security situation for United Nations staff. Today, the\r\nGeneva Conventions go a long way in protecting\r\nuniformed personnel in combat situations. United Nations\r\npersonnel working to promote and alleviate the suffering\r\ncreated by war are not protected in the same way under\r\ninternational law. It is therefore important to improve the\r\nsecurity situation of United Nations staff, and we urge\r\nmore countries to sign and ratify the Convention on the\r\nSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.\r\nTo further facilitate the United Nations role in\r\npreventing conflicts, Norway took the initiative two years\r\nago to establish a Trust Fund for Preventive Action. This\r\nfund has made it possible for the United Nations to\r\nundertake preventive missions and diplomatic initiatives\r\nit otherwise would not have the resources to carry out.\r\nSome countries have made contributions to the fund. We\r\nencourage others to do the same.\r\nTo enable the Security Council to better fulfil its\r\nprime task of preventing conflict and securing\r\ninternational peace, it is important to enhance its\r\nlegitimacy while not compromising its efficiency. We\r\nneed to find broad-based solutions which better reflect the\r\npolitical realities of today.\r\nConflict prevention, crisis management and peace\r\nbuilding clearly require a coordinated approach. We must\r\nsecure a better unity of purpose and integrate United\r\nNations peace-building efforts with those of other\r\nstakeholders. Norway will be taking over the\r\nchairmanship of the Organization for Security and\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 1999, and we are\r\ndetermined to further refine the already well established\r\nworking relationship between the United Nations and the\r\nOSCE.\r\nMost armed conflicts of today are taking place within\r\nStates. Civilians are increasingly affected, and indeed\r\nsingled out as military targets. In this context, the adoption\r\nin Rome a few months ago of the statute establishing an\r\nInternational Criminal Court is truly a historic achievement.\r\nThe existence of a permanent, global institution of this kind\r\nwill allow us to address the serious problem of impunity\r\nand will significantly enhance deterrence of the most\r\nheinous international crimes. The statute also provides for\r\ncredible protection against biased, arbitrary and otherwise\r\nunwarranted prosecutions.\r\nWe need more, not less, involvement of the United\r\nNations and regional organizations to prevent underlying\r\nconflicts from bursting into flames. In Kosovo, we have in\r\nthe last few months witnessed an alarming deterioration,\r\nwhere the parties seem determined to resolve the conflict\r\nby military means. There is an urgent need for a ceasefire,\r\naccess for international humanitarian organizations to all\r\nparts of Kosovo and stronger involvement by the\r\ninternational community, in order to facilitate a negotiated\r\npolitical solution.\r\nFive years ago the Oslo Accord was signed in\r\nWashington, and gave hope for a peaceful future for the\r\npeople of the Middle East. Although progress has been\r\nmade, the peace process is today in serious difficulties.\r\nThere is, however, no alternative to a negotiated settlement.\r\nThe responsibility for advancing the peace process lies first\r\nand foremost with the parties themselves. We therefore urge\r\nthe parties to do their utmost to build confidence and\r\ncooperation and to refrain from all unilateral measures and\r\nactions designed to pre-empt the outcome of the final status\r\nnegotiations.\r\nAlthough developments in Latin America in general\r\nhave been positive over the past few years, there are still\r\nsituations that give cause for concern. Every support should\r\nbe given to the new Government in Colombia in its efforts\r\nto end the armed conflict. The international community\r\nshould also give continued support to the implementation of\r\nthe peace accords in Guatemala. Consolidating the peace is\r\nas important as ending the war.\r\nNorway commends the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport on security and development in Africa. Recent\r\ndevelopments are indeed worrying and may threaten the\r\nstability and future prospects of large parts of the\r\ncontinent. The African nations themselves have the prime\r\nresponsibility for ensuring a political climate that is\r\nconducive to stability and economic growth.\r\nHowever, the international community must provide\r\npolitical support and assist in mediation, peacekeeping,\r\nhumanitarian aid, human rights enhancement,\r\ndemobilization efforts and institution-building. It is vital\r\nthat these activities be coordinated and mutually\r\nsupportive. Here the United Nations must play a leading\r\nrole, in close cooperation with the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity and the subregional organizations. We\r\nfollow with great interest the ongoing work by the\r\nSecurity Council in this respect, and we look forward to\r\nthe discussions on the General Assembly’s follow-up of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report during this session.\r\nIf we are to meet effectively the many global\r\nproblems facing us, there is no alternative to concerted\r\nmultilateral action. We must build a future based on\r\ninternational law, where solidarity and social\r\nresponsibility are not confined within national boundaries,\r\nbut stretch across borders and continents. We, as\r\nGovernments, must do this in close cooperation with civil\r\nsociety, with non-governmental organizations. In all this,\r\nthe United Nations must be at the very centre of our\r\nmultilateral efforts.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on the Minister of State and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Côte d’Ivoire and former President of\r\nthe General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy.\r\nMr. Essy (Côte d’Ivoire) (interpretation from\r\nFrench): Allow me, Mr. President, to offer you my\r\nwarmest congratulations on your unanimous election to\r\nguide the work of the fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly. The honour bestowed upon you attests to the\r\ngood relations which your country, Uruguay, has forged\r\nover the decades with the nations that make up the\r\ninternational community. The noble task which awaits\r\nyou, far from being merely prestigious or simply one of\r\nprotocol, frequently proves to be both delicate and\r\ndifficult.\r\nIt involves presiding over the most eminent forum of\r\ndebate for world affairs during a period in which, in\r\nvarious places, one crisis follows another, such that\r\naround the world neither peace nor war prevails. I am\r\nconvinced that your talents as a diplomat, your passion\r\nfor peace and development and your enthusiasm will\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nserve you well in dealing with the most complex debates\r\nand the most tangled webs of procedure. Rest assured that\r\nour best wishes will be with you throughout this session,\r\nwhich, we feel sure, under your expert presidency, will be\r\ncrowned with success.\r\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor, H. E.\r\nHennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the remarkable way in\r\nwhich he guided our work in the last session and for the\r\npersonal touch with which he ensured and improved\r\ncoordination between the main bodies of the United\r\nNations. We feel certain that in his parliamentary career in\r\nhis country he will display the same efficiency and skill he\r\nshowed in this forum. Finally, allow me to pay an emphatic\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who,\r\nthrough his tireless commitment, has been able to restore\r\nconfidence in our Organization and make it an\r\nincomparable instrument for international relations.\r\nI wish to hail his efforts to bring peace to the world,\r\nand particularly to Africa, and the special attention he gives\r\nto the economic and political situation on our continent. I\r\nalso wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation, to congratulate him sincerely on his excellent\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, the clarity and\r\nconciseness of which will be very useful in inspiring our\r\ndebate during the fifty-third session.\r\nDuring the past year, the world has entered a phase of\r\ndifficulties and uncertainties such as it had not seen for\r\nalmost a decade. The crisis born in the most dynamic\r\neconomies of South-East Asia has gradually reached other\r\nregions. Today it seems to threaten all the countries of the\r\nplanet, from the richest to the poorest.\r\nThis shows very well the extent to which the\r\nphenomena of globalization and interdependence among\r\nStates and peoples have spread. No country, no matter how\r\nprosperous, can now hope to escape a crisis such as the one\r\nSouth-East Asia has suffered and continues to suffer which\r\nnow threatens other regions. This shows that the fight for\r\ndevelopment and the struggle against poverty concern all of\r\nus.\r\nEmergent economies, which are paying the price of a\r\ncrisis that, over these last months, has thrown tens of\r\nmillions of people back into poverty and insecurity, are\r\nintegral parts of a sort of a global economic and financial\r\npuzzle. The jolts these economies are experiencing weaken\r\nthe whole system.\r\nThis risk, which everyone can see is real, should\r\nlead us to reconsider our traditional notion of the division\r\nbetween countries of the North and of the South. We\r\nshould not, of course, ignore here the gulf between North\r\nand South or challenge the existence of the distinct forms\r\nof poverty that make for starkly different conditions of\r\nexistence, and even survival, for the most destitute\r\npeoples of the industrialized countries and those of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWhat, on the other hand, is more and more\r\nquestionable with the advance of globalization is the idea\r\nof a possible divergence of destinies, which could lead\r\nsome countries — the wealthiest — to continue their\r\nmarch forward, while leaving the poor ones “along the\r\nside of the road”, to quote a popular phrase.\r\nThe crisis we have been witnessing for a year now\r\nshould convince us that there is a common destiny which\r\nbinds together all Governments and all peoples of the\r\nplanet. The latter, whether they are richer or poorer, are\r\nbound by the same necessity — that of progressing\r\ntogether along the path of development. The current crisis\r\nshows us another vital need — that of solidarity, for\r\nwhich multilateral cooperation is the prime instrument.\r\nThe United Nations must once again become the natural\r\nvehicle of this multilateral cooperation. Unfortunately, we\r\nmust note that this notion of solidarity, which has become\r\nan agreed formula in official declarations, is acted upon\r\nless and less in any concrete way.\r\nWe recall the famous objective — which a few\r\ndecades ago seemed quite modest — of establishing the\r\ndesirable level of official development assistance at 0.7\r\nper cent of gross national product of industrialized\r\ncountries. In noting, as the Secretary-General has done in\r\nhis report on the work of the Organization, that official\r\ndevelopment assistance has been steadily decreasing for\r\na decade and today represents only 0.22 per cent of the\r\ngross national product of industrialized countries, we must\r\nrecognize that this call for solidarity is reaching\r\nincreasingly deaf ears in international forums.\r\nAlong the same lines, I would like to stress that the\r\nstrategies for development debated and agreed among\r\nGovernments, as well as the decisions adopted at the\r\nmajor United Nations conferences, so far have not been\r\nimplemented to the desired extent, due to insufficient\r\nfinancing. The mid-term evaluation of the outcome of the\r\nRio Conference on Environment and Development was in\r\nthis respect quite revealing of the present financial limits\r\nfor aid to development. An effort commensurate with the\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nproblem would allow us to radically change its basic\r\nelements.\r\nThe 1998 Human Development Report, published by\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme a few weeks\r\nago, makes some significant comparisons. It shows, for\r\nexample, that Americans annually spend $8 billion on\r\ncosmetics — $2 billion more than the amount needed to\r\nfinance basic education for a large part of the world\r\npopulation. To quote the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nwork of the Organization,\r\n“a bridge must be constructed between, in effect, the\r\nDow Jones index and the human development index”\r\n(A/53/1, para. 15).\r\nWe expect also that a new drive towards cooperation\r\nand development will not only combat poverty and\r\nexclusion but also promote international peace and security.\r\nConflicts frequently have social and economic roots,\r\nand this dimension should be fully integrated into the\r\napproaches devised by the international community in the\r\nareas of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict\r\npeace-building.\r\nI wish to reiterate, and express the support of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire for, the proposal made by the Secretary-General in\r\nparagraph 30 of his report on the work of the Organization\r\nto better use the possibilities of Article 65 of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, which provides that the Economic and\r\nSocial Council may furnish information to the Security\r\nCouncil upon a request from the latter.\r\nWith the exception of very limited applications in\r\n1949 and 1959, this provision of the Charter has not been\r\ninvoked. Because it is based on fraternity, dignity and\r\nequality between peoples and States, solidarity needs to be\r\nthe cardinal value in the new world that is emerging from\r\nthe ideological battlefields of the past.\r\nProgress in communications technology has today\r\nbrought people closer than ever. Stepping outside of their\r\nown cultures, men and women can experience the same\r\nevents at the very same moment. They are upset and\r\nshocked by the pictures and consequences of a natural\r\ndisaster or a terrorist attack. They are impassioned by the\r\nsame sports events and are reduced to tears by exceptional\r\nevents such as the liberation of Nelson Mandela or the fall\r\nof the Berlin Wall, which give true ethical significance to\r\nthe evolution of humankind.\r\nDuring the past decade, we have witnessed\r\nspectacular progress, in almost all countries, with respect\r\nto the positive values that cement solidarity between\r\npeoples. Almost all societies are now open and receptive\r\nto pluralism. Every day I see that the peoples of the\r\nAfrican continent are hungering for participation. They\r\nwish to have their say in national matters and to take their\r\nfuture into their own hands.\r\nThroughout the world, civil society is making its\r\nclaims and aspirations felt. Everywhere Governments, to\r\nvarying degrees, are becoming aware of this extraordinary\r\nchange and, in the context of diverse political formulas\r\nand variable schedules, they are acceding to the demands\r\nof the people with respect to democratization.\r\nThis new global focus on human rights and\r\npluralism is reflected increasingly in the international\r\norder. Buttressed by the non-governmental organizations,\r\nGovernments have decided to ban barbaric weapons such\r\nas anti-personnel landmines, whose principal victims are\r\ncivilians, especially children. The broad and massive\r\nsupport given by the international community to the\r\nOttawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction, which has been signed\r\nby 128 States and which will enter into force after the\r\ndeposit by the fortieth State of its instrument of\r\nratification, allows us to hope for success in the efforts\r\nundertaken to fight against another scourge — small arms\r\nand small-calibre weapons — which affects mainly\r\ncivilians and foster criminality and insecurity.\r\nGlobal progress on the ethical level is evident also\r\nin the adoption in July 1998 of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, thus enshrining the progress\r\nbegun by the international criminal tribunals for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. In this respect, the\r\nfirst judgments, handed down on 2 September last, have\r\na dual significance. Fifty years after its adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of Genocide has now seen a concrete\r\ncontinuance: the appalling crime of genocide, repeatedly\r\ncarried out since 1945, will no longer go unpunished. The\r\nsecond positive element of the judgments rendered by the\r\nArusha Tribunal is the recognition that sexual violence\r\ncommitted systematically and on a broad scale in the\r\ncontext of conflicts meets the definition of the crime of\r\ngenocide.\r\nAnother concern for my Government is the scourge\r\nof terrorism, a true hydra-headed menace that is blindly\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nattacking in places where we least expect it. It is no longer\r\nenough to forcefully condemn this evil; we must try to\r\nextirpate its roots as it stems, with rare exceptions, from\r\ninjustice or the intolerable humiliation of peoples. The fight\r\nagainst terrorism is first and foremost a fight against\r\ninjustice in all its forms. Côte d’Ivoire reiterates its\r\nsympathy for those States that have fallen victim to bomb\r\nattacks. It reasserts its commitment to work in the context\r\nof cooperation with all States to eradicate these crimes,\r\nwhich cannot be justified regardless of their motivation.\r\nThe time has come, as was stated at the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement Summit in Durban, to convene an international\r\nconference dealing with all aspects of terrorism that would\r\nlead to a convention allowing us to eradicate this scourge.\r\nTo strengthen cooperation for development and\r\npromote democratization and pluralism are the two focal\r\npoints for the action which the international community\r\nshould take in order to allow peace and security to\r\nprogress, which is the fundamental mission of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nThis concern falls in line perfectly with the objectives\r\nof the Government of Côte d’Ivoire, which, under the\r\nleadership of our President, Henri Konan Bédié, is\r\ncommitted to relaunching strong, sound and lasting\r\neconomic growth and to forge, in a spirit of solidarity, a\r\nmore united, homogenous society based on participatory,\r\npeaceful democracy.\r\nAt the political level, the cabinet reshuffle that took\r\nplace on 11 August last resulted in greater openness and in\r\nnew political blood. At the institutional level, several\r\nmeasures were adopted aimed at broadening and deepening\r\nthe regionalization and decentralization process.\r\nMoreover, constitutional reform is being undertaken in\r\norder to establish the rule of law, to consolidate State\r\nstructures and strengthen representative democracy. The\r\nlatter has given rise to the creation of a Senate, which will\r\nhelp us to strengthen the democratic debate and give us a\r\nmore balanced representation of the regions.\r\nAt the economic level, let me stress that in 1997 —\r\nand for the third consecutive year — the rate of growth of\r\nour country’s gross national product was 7 per cent. That\r\nrate, I would underscore, is higher than the demographic\r\nrate of growth of 3.8 per cent. Inflation was controlled at\r\n5 per cent in 1997, whereas the rate of investment was 15\r\nper cent of the gross national product, 70 per cent of which\r\nwas private investment.\r\nIt is noteworthy that the management of the Alliance\r\nfor Africa’s Industrialization, which held its first meeting\r\non 17 and 18 September last in Abidjan, reaffirmed that\r\nindustrialization is a necessity for the economic progress\r\nof Africa and is the only means of transforming its\r\neconomy in order to integrate it positively into the current\r\ncontext of globalization.\r\nAfrica will continue to rely for its industrial\r\ndevelopment on its partners from friendly countries. We\r\nwish here to welcome the initiative of the Government of\r\nthe United States on partnership and economic growth in\r\nAfrica which aims particularly to allow a number of\r\nAmerican products access to the American market.\r\nWe wish also to express our gratitude to the\r\nGovernment of Japan for its continuing commitment to\r\nthe development of Africa, as evidenced by the upcoming\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD II), set to take place in Tokyo in October.\r\nWe also wish to congratulate and thank all the\r\nGovernments of the donor countries that have forgiven\r\ndebts to the African countries, especially the least\r\ndeveloped ones.\r\nOn the social level, I wish to take a moment to\r\nmention some points relating to health, a vital element in\r\nsocio-economic development. Action in the field of\r\nhealth, as the Assembly knows, contributes effectively to\r\nthe fight against poverty. Côte d’Ivoire has therefore\r\nmade this an absolute priority for several decades. Aware\r\nthat our world has become a global village, we have\r\ntirelessly pursued these efforts within our country, while\r\nputting more and more effort into the promotion of health\r\nat the international level.\r\nSeveral important recent events prove this\r\ncommitment: the participation of President Henri Konan\r\nBédié as the representative of our continent at the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO); the\r\nadoption by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) last\r\nJune of two resolutions proposed by Côte d’Ivoire, one\r\nrelating to the African fund to combat AIDS and the other\r\non the African initiative to fight against malaria; and the\r\nlaunching of the initiative on anti-retrovirus treatments,\r\nfor which Côte d’Ivoire has been selected as one of the\r\ncountries participating in the experimental phase. In order\r\nto better mark our commitment to the success of this\r\nprogramme, we have decided to allocate the sum of\r\n$1 million to it.\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nMoreover, Côte d’Ivoire organized a regional meeting,\r\nattended by the Presidents of Benin and Ghana, to promote\r\npublic awareness of, and the struggle against, Buruli’s\r\nulcer, a little-known but degrading and destructive illness.\r\nThe multiplicity of conflict situations in Africa has\r\nbecome a real subject of concern for the entire international\r\ncommunity. Hence the Security Council met on 25\r\nSeptember 1997 at Foreign Minister level to consider the\r\nneed for concerted international action to promote peace\r\nand security in Africa. At the end of that meeting, the\r\nCouncil asked the Secretary-General to submit to it by\r\nFebruary 1998 a report containing concrete\r\nrecommendations regarding the sources of conflict in\r\nAfrica, way to prevent and address them, and how to lay\r\nthe foundation for durable peace and economic growth.\r\nIn response to this Security Council request, the\r\nSecretary-General prepared an excellent report entitled “The\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa” (S/1998/318), which\r\ngives a straightforward assessment of the political and\r\neconomic situation in Africa and makes objective\r\nrecommendations, while indicating the mistakes made by\r\nAfrican leaders and the shortcomings in international\r\ncooperation in this area.\r\nThe report essentially always takes us back to the\r\nprimary mission of our Organization: the maintenance of\r\npeace, and the principal instrument for this, which is\r\ncollective security. The latter remains at the heart of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. The original idea, it should be\r\nremembered, was that in the modern world, any conflict,\r\nwhether regional or local, could affect the whole of\r\ninternational society, and that through alliances and\r\ninterventions it could well spread, with all the devastating\r\nconsequences imaginable.\r\nIt is in order to guard against these situations and to\r\nprovide every means to react to them that the 1945 Charter,\r\nin Chapter VII, takes account of the regional character of\r\ncollective security. The regional mechanism is intended to\r\nprovide continuity and to strengthen the action of the\r\ninternational community in the maintenance of peace,\r\nwithout in any way challenging the primary role of the\r\nSecurity Council, which, duly informed of the initiatives\r\nundertaken by States bound by regional agreements, is the\r\nonly body which can authorize the use of force.\r\nIt is in this spirit, and always taking care to refer first\r\nto the Security Council, that the system of regional security\r\nhas always functioned, be it in Africa or in Europe, even\r\nthough with the involvement of the Atlantic Alliance in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia the situation was somewhat\r\ndifferent.\r\nThe end of the cold war, with a backdrop of change\r\nin the general international security situation and an\r\nincreasing will by the great Powers to limit themselves to\r\ninterventions in the context of the United Nations, has\r\nundoubtedly contributed to the reactivation of regional\r\nsecurity. What was at stake, we must agree, was the very\r\nsurvival of certain regions of the world, prey to violent\r\nupheavals and mostly abandoned to their own fate.\r\nRegrettably, this is the picture which we see in an Africa\r\ntorn apart by conflicts whose scope and gravity the\r\ninternational community does not always grasp.\r\nThese are the realities which were in the minds of\r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs, Defence, the Interior and\r\nSecurity of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) when they met recently in\r\nYamoussoukro, Côte d’Ivoire, and then in Banjul,\r\nGambia, to lay the foundations of a mechanism for the\r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts and\r\nfor the maintenance of peace and security. The resulting\r\ntext, reached by consensus at the level of experts, will\r\nsoon be submitted for adoption by the conference of\r\nheads of State and Government scheduled for the end of\r\nOctober in Abuja.\r\nWest Africa has plenty of experience in this\r\nconnection, since in recent years it has had to mobilize\r\ntwice in order to settle two bloody conflicts in Liberia,\r\nfollowed by Sierra Leone, and has thus acquired\r\nconsiderable resources under the flag of the ECOWAS\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). The success of the\r\norganization in carrying out such interventions prompted\r\nit to institutionalize ECOMOG as its armed mechanism,\r\nwhich is mainly preventive. This is a big step forward for\r\nECOWAS, originally created as a specialized subregional\r\norganization with the goal of promoting economic\r\ncooperation and eventually the integration of its member\r\nStates.\r\nThis subregional mechanism will of course become\r\npart of the general system of the United Nations Charter\r\nand the regional system of OAU. It will cover all aspects\r\nof security, including natural disasters. Political\r\nconsiderations cannot be forgotten, for experience has\r\nshown that conflicts may well lead to the decay of\r\ngovernmental institutions, the economy and social and\r\npolitical institutions.\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nUnder these circumstances, any intervention strategy\r\nis designed first and foremost to deal with disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and the reintegration of combatants or\r\ndisplaced persons, as well as the rehabilitation of\r\ninfrastructures and above all the reconstruction of society,\r\nwith democracy as the key word.\r\nAll in all, member States believed that it was precisely\r\nbecause it was conceived for development and economic\r\nintegration that ECOWAS was particularly suited to\r\nundertake peace-building in the region. The implementation\r\nof the mechanism will depend above all upon the political\r\nwill of member States. For its part, Côte d’Ivoire will be\r\ninvolved, as it was in the quest for peace in Liberia and\r\nSierra Leone, and as it is now in the case of mediation to\r\nbring peace back to Guinea-Bissau.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank and\r\ncongratulate the Governments of the United States of\r\nAmerica, France and Great Britain for deciding to\r\nharmonize their various initiatives to assist our armies in\r\norder to enhance our peacekeeping capabilities.\r\nIn this connection, I am happy that we are\r\ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the first\r\npeacekeeping operation in 1948, and I pay tribute to the\r\nmemory of all the men and women who have given their\r\nlives in the service of the United Nations.\r\nAssuring collective security in the context of credible\r\ninternational cooperation and guaranteeing fair, sustainable\r\ndevelopment is an ongoing challenge to the United Nations;\r\nit must urgently provide appropriate, concrete answers.\r\nIn this regard, I believe that our action must be\r\nconducted on three very distinct fronts.\r\nIn the first place, we must firmly recall, whenever\r\nnecessary, the fundamental principles proclaimed by the\r\nSan Francisco Charter concerning relations between States,\r\nand in particular the independence and territorial integrity\r\nof Member States of the United Nations. Since the end of\r\nthe cold war, conflicts between States have almost entirely\r\ndisappeared, and that fully reflects the legal force of the\r\nprinciples I have just mentioned.\r\nLet me stress that in Africa the principle of the\r\ninviolability of borders is of capital importance, as the\r\nOAU has emphasized since its establishment. The\r\nupheavals in the Great Lakes region must be settled in\r\naccordance with this principle.\r\nSecondly, it is necessary to discourage and ban from\r\ninternational society those regimes which violate the most\r\nelementary principles of democracy.\r\nFinally, it is vital to enhance international peace by\r\na clear delineation of the responsibilities of the United\r\nNations and regional organizations. In this connection, we\r\nwould like to note and hail the complementarity and\r\nharmony of efforts made, within the context of the United\r\nNations, by the Non-Aligned Movement, the OAU and\r\nthe Southern African Development Community (SADC),\r\nin order to put an end to the new crisis besetting the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Their combined\r\nforces have secured the return to stability of several West\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nHere, I would like to salute in particular the action\r\nof ECOWAS and its military component, ECOMOG, and\r\ninvite the international community to provide them with\r\nevery possible support necessary for the accomplishment\r\nof their mission. This interaction between the world\r\nOrganization and regional organizations must be further\r\nstrengthened in the future.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like briefly to mention the\r\nveritable “sea serpent” of the process of reforming the\r\nUnited Nations and the United Nations system and to\r\nexpress a certain disappointment at the very limited\r\nresults we have achieved after several years of effort. The\r\nquestion of restructuring the Security Council seems to be\r\nat a standstill, even though, in almost ritual fashion, at\r\none session after another we renew the mandate of the\r\nWorking Group charged with reaching an agreement\r\nacceptable to all Member States.\r\nAs for the excellent reform programme that the\r\nSecretary-General presented to us last year, it has\r\ncertainly been very positively received, but we have\r\npostponed certain decisions that are ours alone to make\r\nwith regard to certain of his suggestions and\r\nrecommendations. I hope that the present session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will enable us to enrich our thinking\r\non reform and finally move on to action in this sphere.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Abul-Qader Ba-Jammal,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof the Republic of Yemen.\r\nMr. Ba-Jammal (Yemen) (interpretation from\r\nArabic): On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of\r\nYemen, I have great pleasure in expressing to Mr. Opertti\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nour heartfelt congratulations on his election as President of\r\nthe present session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that his competence and experience will enable\r\nhim to guide the session’s deliberations and achieve its\r\nobjectives.\r\nAt the same time, I should like to express our\r\nrecognition of the good offices of Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization, and of his great\r\nsuccess in serving peace within the framework of\r\npreventive diplomacy in order to defuse international crises\r\nbefore they flare up and to protect innocent victims. I also\r\nhave great pleasure in noting the intellectual and\r\norganizational efforts that are being made to revitalize\r\nUnited Nations activities in order to keep abreast of\r\ndevelopments at the end of the present century and meet\r\nthe demands of the next. We wish Mr. Annan every success\r\nin carrying out his future tasks.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen, its Government and people,\r\nhas made consistent endeavours to strengthen democratic\r\npractices based on political pluralism, freedom of the press,\r\nguarantees of public freedom and the protection of human\r\nrights.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen has realized the vital\r\nimportance of carrying out political, economic, financial\r\nand administrative reforms, together with a programme of\r\nstabilization and restructuring. When the due historical\r\nprocess brought about the unity of the country, Yemen\r\ninherited two political and economic systems based on\r\ndifferent organizational, cultural and ideological structures.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen, which represents the united\r\nYemen, has therefore launched a process of radical political\r\nand institutional reform intended to bring about national,\r\nsocial and political integration, making democratic practices\r\nmore deeply entrenched and increasing society’s\r\nparticipation in the political decision-making process. This\r\nincludes increasing the social role of Yemeni women,\r\nliberating them from all constraints on their participation\r\nand encouraging their integration in development.\r\nNaturally, bringing about economic and administrative\r\nreforms based on an open and liberal economy, free trade\r\nand the increased participation of the private sector requires\r\nnew legal and administrative mechanisms which may have\r\na negative impact on segments of society with limited\r\nincome and on the unemployed. Undoubtedly, this provides\r\nan incentive for the provision of assistance for all the\r\ncountries engaged in this experience, including Yemen, in\r\norder to achieve the concrete economic and financial results\r\nthat can alleviate the negative impact of such changes on\r\nthe social sectors that are unable to respond to the process\r\nof economic and financial adjustment and appropriate\r\nrestructuring in a natural and appropriate way. That is\r\nwhy it is imperative for the economic reform process to\r\nbe accompanied by a social safety net to ensure social\r\nand economic equilibrium and alleviate the impact of\r\nchange affecting the poor, unemployed and limited-\r\nincome groups, with regard to their simple lives and\r\nsubsistence existence.\r\nThis is a task which makes it incumbent upon the\r\ninternational financial institutions to recognize their\r\nresponsibilities in those areas and to intensify their\r\ndevelopment programmes with social, demographic and\r\nenvironmental dimensions. The flow of investments and\r\nassistance from rich countries to the less developed\r\ncountries have to be increased in order to bridge the\r\nstructural gap and enable our society to integrate and\r\nincrease its positive partnership in sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe world today is based on integration and\r\ncomplementarity. It aspires to globalization based on free\r\ntrade, free exchange and open markets. However, these\r\ncan only be achieved by regional cooperation of\r\ngovernment and private sectors of the countries of each\r\nregion. Thus our transition to globalization can be\r\nachieved through the bridges of regional cooperation,\r\nenabling us to make gains and achieve the common\r\ninterests of our peoples without disregarding specificities\r\nor neglecting elements of harmony and regional\r\nintegration. This approach would undoubtedly help in\r\nmaking concrete the spirit of fraternity, interdependence\r\nand integration, and would provide an opportunity to\r\nensure that the fundamental factors for peace and\r\nacceptable coexistence exist, with respect to all regional\r\nparties, which will assist in ensuring a balanced and\r\ncomprehensive world peace.\r\nIn this context, we demand that help and assistance\r\nbe provided to the developing countries and the least\r\ndeveloped countries, in order to enable them to minimize\r\nthe negative impact of the globalization of the world\r\neconomy on their national economies and to achieve\r\nlevels enabling them to participate with the developed\r\ncountries through competitiveness in producing high\r\nquality commodities at competitive prices. This could be\r\naccomplished once they have made reasonable progress in\r\nthe context of regional integration.\r\nDemocracy, social justice, human rights, economic\r\nand political reforms and serious regional cooperation can\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nonly be achieved when there is peace, stability and full\r\nsecurity. Today, given the unstable nature of peace in our\r\nregion, we are again apprehensive lest the situation explode.\r\nThis is due to Israeli intransigence and continuous disregard\r\nof the resolutions of international legitimacy. It is also due\r\nnot only to the Netanyahu Administration’s continued\r\nrejection of international resolutions obliging Israel to\r\nwithdraw from the Palestinian occupied territories, the\r\noccupied Golan Heights and South Lebanon, but also of the\r\nundertakings of the previous Administration of the late\r\nYitzhak Rabin at the Madrid Conference and in the Oslo\r\naccords.\r\nThe current construction of new settlements; the\r\nchanging of the historical heritage of East Jerusalem,\r\nincluding the attempts to obliterate its Arab identity; the\r\nchanging of historical realities and demography: all this\r\ntestifies to the present Israel Government’s flagrant\r\nobstinacy and arrogance. We therefore demand that these\r\npractices, which present further obstacles to the peace\r\nprocess, be halted forthwith.\r\nIn order to prevent the region being plunged back into\r\nthe cycle of conflict, tension and bloodshed, we appeal to\r\nthe international community to take the necessary measures\r\nto compel Israel to honour its international obligations,\r\npursuant to the resolutions of international legitimacy and\r\nall other relevant obligations and agreements.\r\nIt has become clear that the policy of starvation,\r\ndeprivation and economic sanctions imposed on States,\r\nwhether individually or collectively, is of no avail as an\r\neffective means to the realization of certain political goals,\r\nespecially in an era in which freedom, democracy, and\r\nenhanced respect for human rights and the right to self-\r\ndetermination are reaffirmed. Consequently, the victims of\r\nthis policy are the most vulnerable sectors of the targeted\r\nStates. That is why we must reconsider the policy of\r\nimposing sanctions, and must reassess their impact,\r\nreaffirming the importance of humanitarian values and\r\nensuring that the real interests of peoples are not arbitrarily\r\nviolated or threatened for reasons of which these peoples\r\nare innocent. As we have already said, sanctions are no\r\nlonger a useful tool for the realization of political\r\nobjectives. We must engage in peaceful dialogue, and\r\ndefine a time framework and agreed criteria for the\r\nsanctions before they are imposed and put into effect. We\r\nmust also ensure that the people and the poorest social\r\nsectors are not the first and direct victims, as is currently\r\nthe case in Iraq and Libya.\r\nWhile reaffirming respect for international\r\nresolutions, we reiterate the need to lift the sanctions from\r\nIraq and Libya. These have caused serious damage and\r\nsevere human suffering in these fraternal countries.\r\nChildren, old people and women have been particularly\r\naffected.\r\nTerrorism has become an international phenomenon,\r\nand its effects and repercussions are not confined to any\r\none country, people or ideology. It concerns all nations\r\nand peoples, and there is a pressing need for the\r\ninternational community to respond immediately to the\r\ndemand to establish a political, intellectual and\r\ninstitutional system at the international and regional levels\r\nin order to combat it and eradicate the causes of this\r\nuncivilized and inhuman phenomenon, and to deal with its\r\nnegative consequences.\r\nIn this regard, the Republic of Yemen has absolutely\r\nrejected all forms of terrorism. Yemen shares the feelings\r\nof every member of the international community: fear and\r\nconcern at the continuation and increase of this anti-\r\ncivilizational phenomenon which goes counter to all\r\nhuman values. We therefore call for genuine cooperation\r\nto combat this phenomenon collectively and responsibly.\r\nMy country pays particular attention to developments\r\nin fraternal Somalia. We hope that the international\r\ncommunity will help to resolve the conflict between the\r\nvarious warring factions and political groupings. But at\r\nthe same time we would like to remind our brothers in\r\nSomalia that there can be no solution without the\r\ncooperation of the Somalis themselves primarily with\r\nregard to the solutions offered to them from abroad.\r\nOur concern for the situation in Somalia is a result\r\nof our feelings of fraternal responsibility, in addition to\r\nbeing a duty dictated by neighbourliness, especially since\r\nwe are the only country in the region that has received\r\nwaves of refugees from Somalia and other countries\r\nfleeing either national conflicts or purely economic\r\ncircumstances. The Republic of Yemen has paid a high\r\nprice and has sustained heavy suffering for its proximity\r\nto the Horn of Africa.\r\nOur modest potentialities are not adequate to deal\r\nwith this human influx into our country. We already have\r\ndifficulty meeting the needs of our own population. The\r\nrefugees have exacerbated our difficulties, and represent\r\nan intolerable economic and social burden. The provisions\r\nmade by the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees are insufficient to meet the\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nneeds of the refugees in our country. We therefore request\r\nthe international community to provide us forthwith with\r\nassistance in carrying out our humanitarian responsibilities\r\ntowards our refugee brothers. We further call upon all\r\nparties in the Horn of Africa and the concerned Arab\r\nparties to cooperate in reaching realistic solutions to this\r\nprotracted crisis.\r\nMany years have elapsed since the issue of reforming\r\nthe United Nations was first raised, especially with regard\r\nto equitable geographical representation on the Security\r\nCouncil and the formulation of criteria to limit the coercive\r\nuse of the veto. We fully support the call for the application\r\nof democratic norms in and universal representation on the\r\nCouncil in order to reflect the growth of the membership of\r\nthe General Assembly since the 1950s and the major\r\ndevelopments since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of\r\nthe cold war and the expansion of the horizons of\r\nglobalization — all of which make it imperative to reform\r\nthe Security Council. It is a pressing need that must be\r\nanswered if justice and democracy in international relations\r\nare to be achieved, in conformity with the increased\r\ncontacts and improved relations between peoples.\r\nWe therefore support the Open-ended Working Group\r\nset up for this purpose. We appreciate what has been\r\nachieved within the framework of its mandate, pursuant to\r\nthe resolution of the forty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly in 1993. We also appreciate the cooperation\r\ndemonstrated by this Working Group. We call for the\r\ncontinuation of its work in order to fulfil its mandate at an\r\nearly date.\r\nIt is incumbent upon us to cooperate in creating an\r\nappropriate atmosphere for the establishment of a new\r\ninternational order based on justice, freedom of choice and\r\ntolerance. It is our responsibility to work together for\r\nhumanity and its prosperity, and to draw ever closer to our\r\nobjective to live as neighbours on the planet.\r\nThe Acting President (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nWe have heard the last speaker in the general debate for\r\nthis meeting.\r\n(spoke in French):\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nI remind members that statements in exercise of the\r\nright of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second\r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): I wish to make a statement in\r\nexercise of the right of reply in connection with the\r\nstatement made by the Japanese Prime Minister with\r\nregard to our satellite launching.\r\nThe Japanese authorities are now pushing the\r\nsituation in the North-East Asian region to the extreme in\r\nthe wake of our satellite launching. The satellite launch is\r\nentirely a matter of the sovereignty of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. Launching a satellite is not\r\na privilege for a few countries. Any country which has\r\nthe capability to do so may launch a satellite. We are\r\ntherefore not going to become embroiled in a quarrel with\r\nJapan, as we have not committed any wrongdoing with\r\nregard to the satellite launch.\r\nI now wish to reiterate our firm and principled\r\nposition on the frantic anti-Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea campaign staged by Japan in the wake of the\r\nsatellite launch. Japan is crying out against our satellite\r\nlaunching as a threat to security. Japan made public, all-\r\nout criticisms against the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea, inciting gangsters to assault Korean citizens in\r\nJapan. Furthermore, Japanese authorities are calling for a\r\nstrike on our military bases. Japan accuses our country of\r\nnot informing them of the launch in advance, though\r\nJapan has never informed us about the scores of satellites\r\nit has launched in the past. Japan sounds the alarm that\r\nour satellite launching is a threat to peace and security,\r\nwhile its launching of missiles and satellites does not\r\nconstitute a threat to peace and security in the region.\r\nWe declare that this is the logic of thieves, Japanese\r\nstyle. Why is Japan so frantic, and why is it overreacting\r\nover our satellite launch? Japan is using our satellite\r\nlaunch as an excuse to realize its militaristic ambition. It\r\nis ridiculous that Japan is talking about sanctions and\r\ncountermeasures. We are fully accustomed to sanctions.\r\nWe have been living for more than 50 years under United\r\nStates and Japanese sanctions and blockades. We will live\r\nin the future in our own way.\r\nIt is necessary for Japan to contemplate that\r\nreactions such as the hostile acts against the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, attacks on Korean citizens in\r\nJapan and calls for a strike on our missile bases pose a\r\nthreat to peace and security. Japan is inviting disaster and\r\ndestruction with these rash and thoughtless acts. Such\r\n41\r\nGeneral Assembly 8th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-third session 21 September 1998\r\nhostile and belligerent acts lead us time and again to renew\r\nour determination not to tolerate Japan’s arrogance.\r\nThe times are changing, despite Japan’s wishes. Today\r\nis not the 1950s, when Japan earned big chunks of money\r\nby providing logistical support for the United States Army\r\nin the Korean War. We will retaliate against Japan for its\r\nhostile acts against the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and will take revenge against it for its past crimes.\r\nThis is our firm determination. It is very important for the\r\nJapanese authorities to have correct knowledge about the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and its people.\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): That is a\r\nhard act to follow.\r\nMay I respond briefly to the remarks made earlier\r\ntoday by the Foreign Minister of Argentina concerning the\r\nFalkland Islands.\r\nI welcome the Foreign Minister’s references to the\r\nhigh level of cooperation between the United Kingdom\r\nand Argentina which increasingly characterizes our\r\nbilateral relationship. The British Government sincerely\r\nhopes that the progress which is being achieved will be\r\nbuilt on and developed, and in that regard looks forward\r\nwith pleasure to the visit which President Menem will pay\r\nto the United Kingdom later this year.\r\nThe British Government does not accept the Foreign\r\nMinister’s remarks about sovereignty. We have no doubt\r\nabout Britain’s sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and\r\nthe other British dependencies in the South Atlantic.\r\nIn the Falkland Islands we must heed the wishes of\r\nthe people. The elected representatives of the islanders\r\nexpressed their views clearly when they visited the United\r\nNations for the debate in the Committee of 24 on 6 July.\r\nThey asked the Committee to recognize that they, like any\r\nother democratic people, should be allowed to exercise\r\nthe right of self-determination. As the democratic voice of\r\nthe Falkland Islands people they reiterated their view that\r\nthey did not want to be part of Argentina.\r\nDespite our differences with Argentina on the\r\nsubject of sovereignty, we maintain a constructive\r\ndialogue with the Argentine Government on matters such\r\nas hydrocarbons, development and fisheries in the South\r\nAtlantic. We continue to hold discussions on these issues\r\non a regular basis, while maintaining our position\r\nregarding sovereignty over the Falklands, and value these\r\npractical steps to develop United Kingdom-Argentine\r\ncooperation.\r\nMs. Ramírez (Argentina) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The Argentine Republic, having heard the\r\nstatement made by the delegation of the United Kingdom,\r\nwould like to endorse the concepts expressed in the\r\ngeneral debate this afternoon, 21 September, by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, International Trade and\r\nWorship, Mr. Guido di Tella.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.40 p.m.\r\n42\r\n"
