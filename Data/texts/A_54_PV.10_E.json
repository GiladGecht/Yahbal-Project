(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Rexhep Meidani, President of the\r\nRepublic of Albania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Albania.\r\nMr. Rexhep Meidani, President of the Republic of\r\nAlbania, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Albania, His Excellency\r\nMr. Rexhep Meidani, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Meidani (spoke in French): Let me begin,\r\nSir, by congratulating you on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly, and to voice my full\r\nconfidence that the work of this session, under your\r\nleadership, will be crowned with success. I wish also to\r\nexpress my great appreciation of the way in which your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, guided the work of the\r\nfifty-third session.\r\nI take this opportunity also to welcome the Republic\r\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga to the great United Nations family, and to convey to\r\nthem our best wishes for the future.\r\nI am pleased to say that this year has been marked\r\nby genuinely positive developments for Albania in the\r\npolitical, social and economic spheres. Albania has made\r\nprogress in strengthening its democratic institutions and\r\nits civil society, in achieving respect for human rights and\r\nfreedoms, and in enhancing public order and the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\nAs a new democracy, Albania is tireless in its efforts\r\nto strengthen and consolidate its institutional structures.\r\nThere has been tangible progress in bringing about the\r\nindependence of the legislative, executive and judicial\r\nbranches. At the same time, efforts to coordinate them are\r\nmoving forward without in any way affecting their\r\nseparate identities.\r\nThe Albanian State and Government have given\r\npriority to economic development by promoting free\r\ninitiative in the privatization process, principally in\r\nstrategically important sectors. We have also made a\r\ncontinuous effort to formulate and implement modern\r\nlegislation that can encourage and support domestic\r\ninvestment and can channel foreign investment into\r\nespecially profitable vital sectors of our economy.\r\nWe have every reason to appreciate the beneficial\r\ncooperation between Albania and the World Bank, which\r\nhas resulted in the implementation of projects of great\r\nimportance to the Albanian economy, and also in their\r\neffective management. We are grateful too for the support\r\nof the International Monetary Fund, whose activities have\r\nmade a great contribution to revitalizing my country\u0027s finances.\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nWe are well aware that no State can have a healthy\r\neconomy or a solid democracy without secure public order,\r\nthe rule of law and a strong civil society. Among the\r\nthorniest problems now facing Albanian society and\r\nespecially the Albanian State are neutralizing both common\r\nand organized crime and putting an end to corruption in\r\ncertain sectors. Great efforts and substantial resources have\r\nbeen deployed in this area to increase the effectiveness of\r\nthe police and other administrative structures engaged in\r\ncrime-fighting. I take this opportunity to express my great\r\nappreciation for the assistance provided by the\r\nMultinational Advisory Police Element of the Western\r\nEuropean Union and by a number of individual States, in\r\nparticular for the restructuring and training of the Albanian\r\npolice and for the provision of logistical equipment.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to say that the\r\nGovernment of Albania, and I myself, attach great\r\nimportance to the direct commitment of the United Nations\r\nto the process of disarming the civilian population. I would\r\nlike to take this occasion to congratulate Mr. Dhanapala on\r\nhis last visit to Albania.\r\nConsidering corruption to be an extreme evil and a\r\nserious obstacle to the development of a healthy democracy,\r\nthe Albanian Parliament and Government have adopted\r\ntough legislative and administrative measures to deal with\r\nit, establishing specific structures to better uncover and\r\npunish abuse of power in certain corrupt sectors of the\r\nadministration and the judiciary.\r\nDuring previous sessions, Albania has stated — and\r\nwe still hold — that the main objective of our strategy is\r\nintegration into the Euro-Atlantic structures and into other\r\nglobal and regional organizations. Our clear objective is to\r\njoin the European Union, which we do not doubt for a\r\nmoment can be achieved, so the Albanian Government\r\nconsiders as a fundamental priority raising the level of its\r\nrelations with the European Union. I am glad to say that\r\nthere has been a qualitative improvement in those relations.\r\nCooperation has been intensified in various fields, which\r\nbodes well for the signing of an association agreement\r\nfairly soon.\r\nThere have also been positive developments in our\r\nrapprochement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), following the modernization of the Albanian\r\narmy, and above all thanks to the unreserved help provided\r\nto the NATO forces during the Kosovo conflict.\r\nI am also happy to note that my country\u0027s efforts over\r\nmany years to become a member of the World Trade\r\nOrganization seem to be about to be crowned with\r\nsuccess.\r\nThe work of the current session is taking place while\r\nKosovo and the entire region are making efforts to heal\r\nthe wounds inflicted by the Milosevic regime. The\r\nconcerns expressed by the Albanian delegation at the\r\nfifty-third session with regard to the policy of “ethnic\r\ncleansing”, which went as far as genocide, perpetrated by\r\nthe Belgrade regime against the Albanian population of\r\nKosovo, proved well-founded. In the framework of this\r\nchauvinistic policy, the most barbarous crimes were\r\ncommitted: tens of thousands of Albanians were\r\nmassacred, thousands of houses were destroyed or set on\r\nfire, and more than half the population were expelled\r\nfrom their land and had to go to neighbouring countries,\r\nparticularly Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro.\r\nThousands of other people went into the mountains and\r\nlived in unimaginable conditions in order to escape\r\ncertain death. The massacres at Raçak, Peja, Rahovec and\r\nMalishevo, the daily discovery of mass graves containing\r\nchildren, women, young people and old men and women,\r\nkilled by the Serb army, militias and policemen, will\r\ncontinue to testify to a genocide without precedent on the\r\nthreshold of the new millennium.\r\nIt is with horror that I condemn the execution of\r\ndozens of eminent Kosovar intellectuals and the\r\nimprisonment of hundreds of others.\r\nThe Milosevic regime ignored the warnings of the\r\ninternational community and its call for an acceptable\r\nresolution of the Kosovo crisis. It arrogantly rejected the\r\nproposals formulated in the Rambouillet agreement by the\r\nContact Group and increased the repression of the\r\nAlbanians in Kosovo, thus endangering peace and security\r\nin the Balkans. In these circumstances, the NATO\r\ncountries, legitimately defending the sacred principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, had to intervene militarily in\r\norder to force Belgrade to withdraw its armed forces from\r\nKosovo.\r\nWe congratulate the international community on\r\nhaving shown on this occasion unlike the similar situation\r\nin Bosnia, a firm will to condemn the crimes perpetuated\r\nagainst a defenceless population, take effective measures\r\nto put an end to those crimes and establish peace in the\r\ntroubled region of the Balkans.\r\nThe whole Albanian nation has expressed its\r\nprofound gratitude to NATO, the United States of\r\nAmerica, the United Nations, the Organization for\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, and all the\r\ninternational forces which contributed to ending the\r\nhumanitarian disaster in Kosovo and re-establishing peace\r\nthere. In particular, I pay tribute to the action and the\r\npersonal commitment of Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, in the settlement of this\r\nconflict and the ending of the humanitarian crisis.\r\nI also pay special tribute to the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia for its commitment to\r\npublic exposure of the crimes against the Albanian people\r\nof Kosovo and for becoming an interpreter for the whole\r\nAlbanian nation in their just request that all those\r\nresponsible for crimes against the innocent population be\r\nput in the dock. I call on all countries, especially those in\r\nour region, to cooperate with the Tribunal, as recommended\r\nin Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe Albanian State has done everything to ensure that\r\nthe conflict in Kosovo is resolved as soon as possible and\r\npeace is re-established in the Balkans. Engaging in intense\r\npolitical activity, we have striven to ensure that the political\r\nforces in Kosovo adopt a common attitude and accept the\r\nRambouillet peace plan. The Albanian State, while\r\ncommitting itself firmly to defending its territorial integrity\r\nand sovereignty, has refused to respond to provocations by\r\nSerb forces at the border. Albania has not fallen for\r\nMilosevic\u0027s manoeuvres designed to extend the conflict in\r\nthe region.\r\nDespite our great economic and financial difficulties,\r\nAlbania has borne the burden of the humanitarian crisis of\r\nthe refugees from Kosovo. Half a million Kosovars\r\ndeported from their homes have found shelter among their\r\nbrothers in Albania. Albanian families opened their doors\r\nto their blood brothers, thereby earning widespread respect\r\nfor their generosity. As I recall this period, I would like to\r\nexpress our deep gratitude for he invaluable assistance\r\ngiven us by States and international organizations, both\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental, especially those\r\nworking within the United Nations framework. The United\r\nNations, implementing Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999), is today, in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis,\r\nplaying a decisive role. The new civil administration,\r\ncomposed of representatives of the entire population of\r\nKosovo, is almost in place, with the help in particular of\r\nthe United Nations, the European Union and the OSCE; it\r\nis working feverishly in the edification, democratization and\r\nstrengthening of a multi-ethnic civil society, with respect\r\nfor human rights and a framework of institutions imbued by\r\nthat respect.\r\nKFOR is carrying out the difficult task of preserving\r\nstability and the fragile peace in the Kosovo region. I take\r\nthis opportunity to thank the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Bernard Kouchner, for his efforts\r\nto attain the established objectives. I am confident that the\r\nUnited Nations and the organizations supporting it will\r\ncontinue their action so as to eliminate all negative factors\r\nthat might compromise a secure and complete peace and\r\nthe future of the Kosovo region. We support the efforts of\r\nall the international and Kosovar political forces to ensure\r\npeaceful coexistence between Albanians and the ethnic\r\nminorities in Kosovo. We express our wish and\r\nconviction that these efforts, based on Security Council\r\nresolution 1244 (1999), will be crowned with success.\r\nThe end of the conflict in the Kosovo region and the\r\nconcern of the international community to transform the\r\nBalkans from the powder keg it has been into a region of\r\npeace and stability have given the countries in our region\r\na historic opportunity to achieve development, prosperity\r\nand democratization. We have resolved not to miss that\r\nopportunity. First and foremost, our societies must\r\nabandon their archaic chauvinistic mindset, which has\r\nbeen the sources of division and hatred and which should\r\nno longer outweigh the desire for unity, friendship and\r\ncooperation among peoples.\r\nWe must struggle towards and succeed in\r\nquarantining all policies that encourage hatred and ethnic\r\ndivisions, because such anachronistic policies have been\r\nthe source of human catastrophes and remain one of the\r\nmain causes of the destabilization of our region and the\r\ndelay in our economic development.\r\nOur countries share common interests in the\r\nstrategic, economic and security spheres. In this regard,\r\nwe want to become integrated into powerful structures\r\nsuch as the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO). But it would not be realistic to\r\nthink we will easily attain this objective. We fully realize\r\nthat we are at the initial stage of this process. Thus we\r\nbelieve that all the countries of the region should\r\ncoordinate their efforts in order to become — all together,\r\nnot separately — integrated into those structures.\r\nThe Stability Pact on South-Eastern Europe is the\r\nfundamental document for the consolidation of democratic\r\nvalues, for economic growth and for the strengthening of\r\nsecurity in our region. I take this opportunity to salute the\r\nfull support provided to this initiative by the countries of\r\nour region at the Cologne and Sarajevo meetings. The\r\nState and the Government of Albania support all efforts\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nthat have been undertaken within the political boundaries of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia to promote democracy and the\r\nprocess of integration in the region. We welcome all\r\ndemocratic developments in Serbia, the consequence of\r\nwhich should be to remove from power the political group\r\nresponsible for the crimes committed in the former\r\nYugoslavia and to eliminate the chauvinistic mindset that\r\nencourages war. Such a mindset is no longer acceptable in\r\ncivilized Europe.\r\nThe Albanian Government is adopting measures with\r\na view to attaining the objectives of the Stability Pact. The\r\nimmediate objectives include various ideas and concrete\r\nproposals aimed at the development of economic relations\r\nwith the countries in the region, the creation of inter-Balkan\r\ninstitutions to monitor respect for human rights and the\r\nstrengthening of security measures. The Albanian State\r\nexpects that in the near future the Balkans will become a\r\ndemocratic region with an economy intended to reach the\r\nlevel of those of the developed countries, a region that\r\nrespects human rights, in accordance with advanced\r\nEuropean and global standards. We believe that because of\r\nthe damage suffered during the conflicts in the former\r\nYugoslavia, and particularly in Kosovo, Albania deserves\r\npreferential treatment within the framework of the Stability\r\nPact.\r\nAs far as we are concerned, the free circulation of\r\npeople, ideas, capital and goods — a Balkan mini-\r\nSchengen — is the precondition for a rapid development of\r\nthe economy, social life and democracy of our region. A\r\ndemocratic Balkans is unimaginable if our countries build\r\nwalls in order to prevent the free circulation of people.\r\nReciprocal free movement would contribute greatly to\r\nbringing people together and to cultural exchanges and,\r\nthereby, to the elimination of the hatred and inter-ethnic\r\nconflicts that up till now have so cruelly shaken this part of\r\nEurope.\r\nAlbania appreciates the role currently being played by\r\nthe European Union, the United States of America and\r\nother countries in the framework of these positive\r\ndevelopments. It hopes that this interest in the development\r\nand democratization of the region will persist with the same\r\nlevel of commitment and the same intensity.\r\nWhile attaching priority to the problems of our region,\r\nthe State and the Government of Albania have been\r\nand continue to remain attentive to developments in other\r\nparts of the world. We welcome the progress in the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East and Northern Ireland. For my\r\npart, I would like to express the fervent hope that these\r\nprocesses prove irreversible.\r\nWe appreciate the role played by the United Nations\r\nin organizing the referendum on the future of East Timor.\r\nWe hope the most recent agreements and resolutions, with\r\nthe international presence, in particular that of the United\r\nNations, will lead to the stabilization of the situation in\r\nthat country as soon as possible.\r\nGiven the ever-growing importance of multilateral\r\ninternational cooperation, Albania intends to become an\r\never more active Member of the United Nations and of\r\nother international organizations, in order to be able to\r\nbetter contribute to safeguarding peace throughout the\r\nworld. Albania salutes the efforts of the United Nations\r\nto continue to strengthen its role in resolving the acute\r\nproblems facing humanity today in the political, economic\r\nand humanitarian spheres. I take this opportunity to\r\nexpress my great appreciation for the action of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, aimed at reforming\r\nand reviving the Organization.\r\nIn connection with this reform, Albania is in favour\r\nof the democratization and strengthening of the Security\r\nCouncil so that it better reflects new international realities\r\nand has more transparent procedures and working\r\nmethods and a simplified decision-making process. We\r\nsupport the financial and budgetary reform of the United\r\nNations, the objective of which is better management of\r\nfinancial resources and, thus, the increased effectiveness\r\nof United Nations programmes and projects.\r\nAllow me to express once again to you,\r\nMr. President, and to all the delegations present here my\r\nfervent wish that this session of the Assembly will meet\r\nwith success in advancing global peace, stability and\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Albania\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Rexhep Mejdani, President of the Republic of\r\nAlbania, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nAddress by Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, His Excellency\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Clerides: I would like to extend my\r\nwarmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. I have no doubt that your long experience and\r\nproven diplomatic skills will guide the work of this session\r\nto a successful conclusion. Moreover, we interpret your\r\nelection as a well-deserved recognition of your country,\r\nNamibia, for which the Cypriot people entertain feelings of\r\nadmiration and friendship.\r\nI would also like to take the opportunity to express my\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Opertti of Uruguay,\r\nfor the determined leadership with which he steered the\r\nwork of the fifty-third session.\r\nCyprus joins other States in extending a warm\r\nwelcome to the new Members of the United Nations: the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga.\r\nAs we are rapidly approaching the dawn of the new\r\nmillennium, we have an obligation to reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to this truly global Organization and to the\r\nideas that have made the United Nations the hope of\r\nmankind for a world governed by peace, justice and the\r\nrule of law.\r\nAnd yet, the challenges that we face seem at times\r\ninsurmountable. Our world is characterized by a large array\r\nof old and constantly emerging new problems, such as\r\nviolent international conflicts and internal strife. Moreover,\r\nthe United Nations has to respond to many challenges, such\r\nas the eradication of poverty, sustainable development, the\r\nfight against terrorism and drug trafficking, the control of\r\nepidemics and natural disasters, and the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe Organization\u0027s efforts in these areas have been\r\nconsiderable and must not be underestimated. I take this\r\nopportunity to reaffirm my Government\u0027s strong\r\ncommitment to the United Nations and our support for the\r\nongoing efforts to reform it, so that it will be able to\r\nsuccessfully meet the considerable challenges that lie\r\nahead.\r\nCyprus will work towards the successful conclusion\r\nof the Millennium Assembly. We look forward to an\r\ninteractive Summit. We anticipate an in-depth and result-\r\noriented discussion, with the participation of civil society,\r\nduring the work of the many special sessions on various\r\nfacets of the Organization\u0027s work.\r\nOne of the major issues of concern to all humanity\r\nis disarmament. I would like to reaffirm our support for\r\nthese efforts including, inter alia, a strengthened review\r\nprocess of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) and the effective implementation of the\r\nChemical Weapons Convention.\r\nIn the field of human rights, the United Nations\r\nplays a very special role not only in developing and\r\nenhancing the regime of human rights instruments, but\r\nalso in the prevention of possible violations and the\r\nconstantly expanding humanitarian relief efforts.\r\nOn the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nGeneva Conventions, we reaffirm our commitment to the\r\ncause of human rights and the promotion of humanitarian\r\nlaw. Cyprus fully supported the adoption of the Statute of\r\na permanent International Criminal Court.\r\nCyprus follows the situation in the Middle East with\r\nintense interest. We rejoice at the winds of hope that have\r\nrecently appeared in the efforts to finally achieve peace in\r\nthat long-tormented area and welcome the recent Israeli-\r\nPalestinian agreement. Cyprus, as a neighbouring State\r\nwith close relations to the parties involved in the Middle\r\nEast, reiterates its support for a just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive settlement based on the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions and the implementation of the peace\r\naccords.\r\nThe recent tragedy that has unfolded in Kosovo has\r\ndemonstrated the fragility of peace in the heart of Europe\r\nand the imperative need to address a new array of\r\nproblems that have the potential to destabilize an entire\r\nregion. The international community, as well as the\r\nparties involved, have an obligation to create the\r\nconditions for reconciliation, so that what has transpired\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nin Kosovo and Yugoslavia in general will never be allowed\r\nto take place again.\r\nCyprus fully supports Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999) and calls for full respect for the human rights of all\r\nKosovars, irrespective of their origin, as well as for the\r\nsovereignty of all States in the region. My Government also\r\nwelcomes the initiative of the European Union that led to\r\nthe adoption of the Stability Pact last June as an important\r\ninitiative that will contribute considerably to the economic\r\nand political stabilization of south-eastern Europe and help\r\nits peoples construct a new future.\r\nCyprus welcomes the several United Nations initiatives\r\nand recommendations stemming from the follow-up to the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General concerning Africa. The\r\ninternational community should redouble its efforts to assist\r\nthe countries of Africa to overcome the ethnic strife and\r\nwars; to eradicate poverty; successfully to combat disease;\r\nto win the fight against drug trafficking; to obtain\r\nsustainable development; and to face the challenges of the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe recent devastating earthquake that struck Turkey\r\nhas once more demonstrated the frailty of human beings\r\nbefore nature\u0027s incredible power of destruction. I take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate to the Turkish people our sympathy\r\nfor the enormous losses suffered and to urge the\r\ninternational community to lend a helping hand for the\r\nreconstruction of the devastated areas. Despite the political\r\nproblems that exist between our respective States, the\r\nmagnitude of the suffering of the Turkish people has deeply\r\nmoved the people of Cyprus.\r\nI wish to congratulate all those countries which rushed\r\nto save Turkish lives, and in particular Greece, which,\r\ndespite its many differences and problems with Turkey, was\r\none of the first countries to send its teams to work side by\r\nside with Turkish teams to rescue the Turkish people who\r\nwere buried alive under the ruins of the earthquake. I want\r\nalso to congratulate Turkey for reciprocating in the same\r\nmanner after the subsequent earthquake in Greece and I\r\nwish to salute the new spirit of friendship which has started\r\nto emerge between the two countries.\r\nThis year marks a quarter of a century since the\r\nTurkish invasion and unlawful occupation of 37 per cent of\r\nthe territory of the Republic of Cyprus. I could today, from\r\nthis podium, point an accusing finger at Turkey and talk at\r\nlength about the ethnic cleansing it practised against the\r\nGreek Cypriots, which resulted in 180,000 Greek Cypriots\r\nbecoming refugees in their own country. I could bring up\r\nthe drama of the relatives of the 1,600 Greek Cypriots\r\nmissing since the invasion of Cyprus by Turkish forces in\r\n1974. I could point out the many violations of human\r\nrights of the Greek Cypriots by citing decisions of the\r\nEuropean Court and reports of the European Commission\r\nof Human Rights, holding Turkey responsible for such\r\nviolations. Today I will abstain from doing so, because I\r\nprefer to look to the future, and not to deal with the past.\r\nWe are currently waiting for the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General to issue invitations to both sides to take\r\npart in negotiations, under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, in the most ambitious initiative ever undertaken\r\nto find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem.\r\nThis initiative enjoys the active support of the\r\ninternational community, and particularly the Group of the\r\neight most industrialized countries, the Security Council,\r\nthe European Union and the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nWe are well aware that currently the international\r\ncommunity, and especially those States which are in a\r\nposition to influence the foreign policy of Turkey, are\r\nworking methodically to persuade Turkey and the Turkish\r\nCypriot leader, Mr. Denktash, to participate in talks\r\nwithout any preconditions; that is, not to insist on the\r\nrecognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern\r\nCyprus, and not to demand that negotiations be conducted\r\nbetween the two States, instead of communities, as\r\nenvisaged in the Security Council resolutions.\r\nRegrettably, on 16 September the Prime Minister of\r\nTurkey, Mr. Ecevit, in a public statement, not only\r\ninsisted on the two preconditions I have just mentioned,\r\nbut added that the economic embargo against the Turkish\r\nCypriots must be lifted. The Prime Minister of Turkey\r\nknows that the so-called embargo is a result of a decision\r\nof the European Court, to the effect that certificates of\r\norigin and/or quality issued by the so-called Turkish\r\nRepublic of Northern Cyprus cannot be accepted by the\r\nEuropean Union, because the State referred to is not\r\nrecognized. The Prime Minister of Turkey should also be\r\naware that there is a category of reciprocal measures that\r\nneed to be discussed and resolved, and that the question\r\nof the embargo falls in that category.\r\nI have already stated publicly, but also to the\r\nSecretary-General and to the heads of State or\r\nGovernment of the five permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council, that we are ready to respond positively\r\nto the Secretary-General\u0027s invitation to attend the talks\r\nand to negotiate a solution to the problem within the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nparameters established by the international community\r\nthrough Security Council resolutions. The parameters so\r\nestablished provide that Cyprus must be a bicommunal,\r\nbizonal federal republic, with a single sovereignty, an\r\ninternational personality and a single citizenship, and that\r\nthe settlement must exclude union, in whole or in part, with\r\nany other country or any form of partition or secession.\r\nMy vision for the solution of the Cyprus problem\r\nwithin those parameters requires a partnership of the two\r\ncommunities that would constitutionally provide for the\r\nmaximum degree of internal self-administration for the two\r\nconstituent cantons, provinces or states. Adhering to the\r\nprinciple of the equal political status of the constituent\r\nparts, it must provide them with the same rights, powers\r\nand functions regarding their respective separate internal\r\nself-administration. The constitution must also provide for\r\nthe effective participation of both communities in the\r\nfederal Government.\r\nSuch a federation, becoming a member of the\r\nEuropean Union, will thrive at home and abroad, enjoying\r\ngenuine peace, stability and security, based on international\r\nlaw and legality. It will be supervised by an international\r\nforce authorized by the Security Council, under terms and\r\nconditions so defined as to give the force the right to\r\nintervene if it finds that one community, by unlawful acts,\r\nputs in danger the safety of the other community or\r\nattempts to destroy the independence, territorial integrity\r\nand sovereignty of the federal State or destroy the\r\nagreements reached.\r\nI have stated that both communities must learn from\r\nthe mistakes of the past and must work hard for the\r\ncreation of a common and bright future for all, instead of\r\nclinging to attitudes which brought about the tragedy in the\r\nisland. It is, therefore, imperative that we find a just,\r\nworkable and viable solution which will safeguard the\r\nhuman rights of every citizen and heal the wounds of the\r\npast, bringing at the same time a sense of security to both\r\ncommunities by providing full disarmament under\r\ninternational supervision.\r\nOur side will approach negotiations on the Cyprus\r\nproblem with courage and flexibility, partly because we\r\nrecognize that solving it is in the interest of all Cypriots,\r\nbut also because that will contribute to the overall stability\r\nof the region, which is so much demanded by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nI regret that Mr. Denktash is reported to have refused\r\nto respond positively to any initiative to negotiate with me\r\nas representative of the Greek Cypriot community, on the\r\npretext that I am also the President of the internationally\r\nrecognized Republic of Cyprus.\r\nTime and time again I have explained to him that I\r\nsit in the talks not as the President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, but as the representative of the Greek Cypriot\r\ncommunity, because the Security Council resolutions call\r\nupon the two communities to negotiate, not upon the State\r\nof the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot\r\ncommunity.\r\nIt also saddens me when he attempts to set aside the\r\nparameters for the solution of the Cyprus problem, set by\r\nthe international community and the high-level\r\nagreements he made before the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations twice, for a bicommunal, bizonal\r\nfederation. He attempts now to set new parameters for the\r\nsolution, based on two separate sovereign States, and to\r\nimpose their acceptance by refusing to come to the\r\nnegotiating table unless his conditions are met.\r\nIn support of his precondition, he advances the\r\nargument that the term ”equal political status”, referred to\r\nin United Nations resolutions, must be interpreted to mean\r\nthat his break-away Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\r\nmust be recognized, since the Republic of Cyprus is\r\ninternationally recognized, in order that the two\r\nnegotiators may have equal status. He forgets that the\r\nSecurity Council, by its resolution, deplored the action of\r\nthe Turkish side of declaring a separate State, and asked\r\nall its members not to recognize it, a request with which\r\nall complied, with the exception of Turkey, the occupying\r\nPower.\r\nThe parameters for the solution of the Cyprus\r\nproblem are already in place. They are included in the\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. What is required is\r\nthe political will of the two sides. I can assure the\r\nAssembly that the Greek Cypriot side stands ready to\r\nnegotiate in good faith so that a bicommunal, bizonal\r\nFederal Republic of Cyprus will finally become a reality.\r\nI join my voice with those of the G-8, the Security\r\nCouncil and the European Union in asking Mr. Denktash\r\nto come to the negotiating table without preconditions. I\r\nhonestly believe that within the parameters of the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions we can find a solution which will\r\nsafeguard the legitimate interests of both communities and\r\nbring peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nI wish also to repeat my invitation to the Turkish\r\nCypriot community to join forces with us in our European\r\nUnion accession course. That course, which is the greatest\r\nachievement since the establishment of the Cyprus\r\nRepublic, is continuing with success. Accession to the\r\nEuropean Union will benefit both communities equally.\r\nThe Cyprus problem has often been described as\r\ncomplicated and intractable. I do not share this view. The\r\nCyprus problem can and will be solved if the international\r\ncommunity demands its solution with the necessary\r\ndetermination, within the parameters it has set.\r\nIn the effort for the solution of the Cyprus problem, as\r\na small State, Member of the United Nations, we rely on\r\nthe support of the international community and the United\r\nNations. We look upon its Charter as a beacon of justice,\r\nand on the United Nations as the hope for a better future.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Cyprus for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the\r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Nigeria.\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President and Commander-\r\nin-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic\r\nof Nigeria, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of\r\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Obasanjo: A little over two decades ago I\r\naddressed this Assembly as head of a military Government\r\nin Nigeria. On that occasion the focus of my statement was\r\nthe urgent need to terminate colonial rule in Namibia and\r\nRhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and dismantle the racist\r\napartheid South Africa. Today it is a great source of joy for\r\nme and my delegation that a distinguished son of Namibia\r\nis presiding over the affairs of the fifty-fourth session of\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly. My delegation\r\nassures you, Sir, of its full cooperation and unwavering\r\nsupport throughout your tenure.\r\nMay I also convey through you, Sir, our deep\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of\r\nUruguay, for the able and efficient manner in which he\r\nconducted the proceedings of the fifty-third session.\r\nOur appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his visionary leadership and the\r\ninvaluable work of the Secretariat under his stewardship.\r\nPermit me also to warmly welcome, on behalf of my\r\ncountry and delegation, the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga, which\r\nhave just joined this family of nations.\r\nI stand before this Assembly today very proud to be\r\nthe leader of a Nigeria that has successfully managed the\r\ntransition to democracy after a decade and a half of\r\nmilitary rule. I would like to seize this opportunity to\r\nexpress the profound appreciation of all Nigerians for the\r\ninternational support and encouragement which combined\r\nso effectively with the relentless determination of\r\nNigerians themselves to reconstruct and transform their\r\ncountry into a vibrant democracy.\r\nOur Administration has raised the hopes of\r\nNigerians, and their expectations are correspondingly\r\nhigh. We are well aware of the enormity of the challenges\r\nthat we face. But we are fully resolved to tackle our\r\nnumerous social, economic and political problems head\r\non. And, by the Grace of God, we will not fail.\r\nSince assuming office some four months ago our\r\nadministration has put in place an institutional framework\r\nfor the purpose of reconciling competing interests and\r\ngroups in our society. Our democratic institutions are now\r\noperating effectively within the system of checks and\r\nbalances enshrined in our Constitution. Furthermore, we\r\nhave opted for a policy of inclusiveness in all our\r\npolitical appointments, with a Cabinet, for instance, in\r\nwhich all registered political parties are represented, thus\r\nmoving away from the divisive practice of winner takes\r\nall.\r\nOur Administration has initiated policies aimed at\r\nrevitalizing the economy in order to create an enabling\r\nenvironment for investment and economic growth. We\r\nhave also put in place an appropriate legal framework for\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nthe protection of foreign investments and repatriation of\r\nlegitimate profits.\r\nOther measures that we have taken include a vigorous\r\nanti-corruption campaign; the promotion of transparency\r\nand accountability in public life; the abolition of decrees\r\nand regulations which hindered the inflow of foreign\r\ninvestment; the generation of opportunities for employment\r\nand income savings for domestic investment; and the\r\nprivatization of key State enterprises, such as electricity and\r\ntelecommunications; legislation and other measures to\r\nredress obvious cases of neglect and injustice done to ethnic\r\nminorities, particularly in the oil-producing areas of the\r\nNiger delta region, and to deal with the problems of the\r\nenvironment; investigation of past human rights violations,\r\nwith a view to promoting and protecting fundamental\r\nfreedoms; and strengthening the capacity of the law\r\nenforcement agencies to promote law and order, as well as\r\nsecurity, and to deal more effectively with the problem of\r\ndrug trafficking.\r\nAfrica is indeed proud and glad to see the end of this\r\ncentury coincide with the total elimination of colonialism\r\nand the twin menace of constitutionalized racism in the\r\nsouthern part of the continent. The United Nations deserves\r\nour warm commendation for the crucial role it has played\r\nin this process.\r\nLet me also pay tribute to the thousands who lost their\r\nlives in the struggle for freedom so that those of us alive\r\ntoday can proudly say we have the destiny of the continent\r\nin our own hands. It is, however, a destiny which poses\r\nmonumental challenges in our effort to improve the quality\r\nof life on our continent. We must strive to alleviate the\r\ngrinding poverty and material deprivation that has\r\npersistently remained a feature of our political freedom.\r\nAs we approach the dawn of the new millennium, the\r\ndefining feature of our increasingly interdependent world is\r\naccelerated globalization, and the liberalization of\r\nproduction, trade, investment and finance.\r\nBut for us in the developing world the reality today is\r\nquite different. Globalization, in its various manifestations,\r\nis already experiencing a troubled relationship with the\r\nimperatives of development.\r\nIt is rather tragic that Africa, the least developed of all\r\nthe regions and the least able to cope with external shocks,\r\nhas borne the brunt of the adverse effects of globalization\r\nof the world economy. There are grim statistics which\r\nindicate that the well-known marginalization of the\r\nAfrican continent has turned into delinkage from the\r\nglobal scene.\r\nSince 1992 Africa\u0027s exports and imports as a share\r\nof world trade has declined from 4 per cent to 2 per cent.\r\nAfrica\u0027s development is presently straitjacketed by a debt\r\nburden of around $300 billion. The continent is\r\nexperiencing import compression, weak productivity and\r\nlow output. On the average, factories that are still\r\noperating do so at less than 30 per cent of installed\r\ncapacity. Africa\u0027s share in total foreign direct investment\r\ninflows to developing countries has dropped from 11 per\r\ncent in the late 1980s to less than 5 per cent in the second\r\nhalf of the 1990s, and to a meagre 1.2 per cent of world\r\nforeign direct investment flows in 1997.\r\nThis trend has continued, despite the efforts of\r\nAfrican countries to implement far-reaching economic\r\nreforms and maintain macroeconomic stability,\r\nparticularly through the introduction of a more open and\r\nbusiness-friendly investment environment, and the\r\nprovision of incentives to attract foreign investment.\r\nIn the quest for a better and fairer management of a\r\nglobalized world economy, it is now incumbent upon us\r\nto direct our searchlight on the unsatisfactory evolution of\r\nthe multilateral trading system. In participating in the\r\nhistoric Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade\r\nNegotiations that ushered in the new rules-based trading\r\nsystem, the developing world had hoped that the new\r\ntrading regime would enhance their trading fortunes,\r\nfacilitate their effective integration into the world\r\neconomy, and arrest their marginalization from the global\r\ntrading system.\r\nUnfortunately, however, the vast majority of\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, have so far\r\nbeen unable to reap the benefits arising from their\r\nmembership of the World Trade Organization. Africa\u0027s\r\ntrade prospects continue to be hampered by the non-\r\nimplementation of the special and differential provisions\r\nthat favour developing countries, and the increasingly\r\nprotectionist measures that are being imposed against their\r\nexport products. Besides, the paucity of technical and\r\nfinancial assistance that would have enabled the\r\ndeveloping countries to take advantage of the limited\r\nmarket access opportunities that exist continues to deepen\r\nAfrica\u0027s marginalization in the globalized world economy.\r\nWithout doubt, the biggest monetary and financial\r\nobstacle confronting developing countries is the chronic\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\ndebt overhang. According to United Nations figures, the\r\nglobal debt of all developing countries stood at $567 billion\r\nin 1980, and $1.4 trillion in 1992. In that 12-year period\r\nthese countries made foreign debt payments totalling $1.6\r\ntrillion. Now, out of the 41 countries which the World Bank\r\ndescribes as heavily indebted poor countries, 33 are African\r\ncountries, a group that some believe is richly deserving of\r\nits own special category: severely indebted low-income\r\ncountries. Today in sub-Saharan Africa every man, woman\r\nand child owes $357. This is a continent where millions\r\nlive in abject poverty, earning around $100 a year, or 27\r\ncents a day. Some African countries now spend as much as\r\nfour times on servicing debts as they do on education and\r\nhealth care. Some countries spend up to 40 per cent of their\r\nnational budgets on debt servicing. Furthermore, it is\r\nreliably estimated that for every dollar given in official\r\ndevelopment aid, $3 go back to the rich countries in debt\r\nservice payments.\r\nI make bold to assert that calling for debt relief for\r\ndeveloping countries is not a plea for charity, but is an\r\nurgent matter of social and economic justice. It has to be\r\nredressed if there is to be peace and stability in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Therefore, we propose definitive debt\r\ncancellation, not just reduction or rescheduling of the debt\r\nservice regime. Eligibility should be limited to unpayable\r\ndebts, which for Africa means the bulk of the $300 billion\r\ncurrent stock of debt. There should be debt remission that\r\nis not predicated on the institutionally harsh conditionalities\r\nof structural adjustment programmes. There should be\r\nrecognition on both sides of the bargaining table that\r\nlenders and borrowers share joint responsibilities for debts\r\nincurred in circumstances that are morally questionable in\r\nthe first place. Debt cancellation should benefit ordinary\r\npeople.\r\nNigerians rightly expect democracy to yield\r\nperceptible dividends in their lives. Our Administration will,\r\nhowever, find the task of meeting this expectation virtually\r\nimpossible without substantial reduction of our debt burden,\r\nespecially as we call on the same citizens to make the\r\nsacrifices that are implicit in the recent measures aimed at\r\nprudent management of our national economy.\r\nI wish to invite the attention of the Assembly to the\r\nrelated issue of illegal capital flight from Africa. It is an\r\nopen secret that much of Africa\u0027s wealth has been\r\nillegally siphoned out of the continent by corrupt regimes\r\nand unpatriotic individuals working in collaboration with\r\nforeign partners. Nigeria and many African countries\r\nwould be able to pay off large portions of their debts if\r\nonly they could recover some of the capital illegally\r\nstashed abroad. We thus believe that now is the time to\r\ncollectively deal with this issue.\r\nIn this regard, Nigeria calls for a concerted effort by\r\nthe international community, through an international\r\nconvention, for the repatriation to Africa and the\r\ndeveloping world of all capital illegally transferred from\r\nthese countries. Such an international convention or\r\nagreement is legally feasible and morally sustainable. It\r\nwill compel participating banks to disclose the source of\r\nthe illegal accounts they hold, repatriate them to the\r\ncountries of rightful ownership and subject the guilty\r\nparties to the full weight of national and international law.\r\nIt is with a heavy heart that I raise the issue of the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic throughout Africa. Our continent is\r\nbearing the brunt of this terrible disease that now kills\r\naround 2 million Africans annually, thus officially\r\novertaking malaria as Africa\u0027s number one primary health-\r\ncare problem. This situation is even more frightening in\r\nthat it has now left 6 million children orphaned in the\r\neastern and southern parts of Africa. In West Africa the\r\ndisease has been spreading just as rapidly. Unlike malaria,\r\nwhich is location specific, HIV/AIDS knows neither\r\nclimatic nor regional boundaries. Global cooperation is an\r\nimperative if we are to succeed in dealing with this\r\nscourge.\r\nAmong the immediate challenges facing Nigeria and\r\nAfrica today is resolving the many conflicts raging on the\r\ncontinent. Today, as many as 19 sub-Saharan countries\r\nare engaged in armed conflicts. The negative impact of\r\nthese conflicts in human, social, economic and\r\nenvironmental destruction does not need to be described\r\nhere. Nigeria and indeed the entire West African\r\nsubregion have devoted considerable human, material,\r\npolitical and diplomatic resources to the resolution of\r\nthese crises in the subregion, starting with Liberia and\r\nsubsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Similarly,\r\nefforts are being made in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and in Angola towards peaceful resolution of their\r\nconflicts.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nIndeed, African leaders at the recent summit of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) in Algiers, and at the\r\nurging of the Nigerian delegation, agreed to declare next\r\nyear as the Year of Peace, Security and Stability in Africa.\r\nBy this declaration, we have dedicated ourselves to making\r\nthe year 2000 the year when Africans direct all their efforts\r\ninto effectively eliminating armed conflicts on their\r\ncontinent. We hope to build on the fresh momentum for\r\npeace occasioned by the budding peace initiatives in Congo,\r\nSierra Leone, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Angola.\r\nWe are also agreed on the overriding need to uphold\r\ncodes of decency, ethics and minimum standards of\r\ndecorum among African Governments and their leadership.\r\nGone are the days when the OAU turned a blind eye to the\r\nexcesses and abuses of power by member Governments.\r\nForceful and undemocratic changes of Governments will no\r\nlonger be overlooked or tolerated. We intend to condemn\r\nin absolute terms all violations of these codes and to\r\nostracize their perpetrators. It is our duty and moral\r\nresponsibility to treat our citizens decently and humanely.\r\nMy country has always believed that the threat to\r\ninternational peace and security from any corner of the\r\nglobe should be considered a threat to the peace and\r\nsecurity of the world as a whole. While the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security remains the primary\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council, the Charter provision\r\nfor the complementary role of regional and subregional\r\ngroups has also proved to be critical to the maintenance of\r\npeace at the regional and global levels. The establishment\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) is a clear\r\ntestimony of our commitment to subregional peace. As the\r\nrecord shows, ECOMOG succeeded in putting an end to the\r\nLiberian war in 1997, reinstating the democratically elected\r\nPresident of Sierra Leone in 1998, and bringing about the\r\ncurrent Peace Agreement for Sierra Leone signed in Lomé\r\nin July 1999.\r\nThe time has come, however, for the Security Council\r\nto assume its full responsibility, specifically in Sierra Leone\r\nand other conflict flash points in Africa. For too long, the\r\nburden of preserving international peace and security in\r\nWest Africa has been left almost entirely to a few States in\r\nour subregion. The non-implementation of the Peace\r\nAgreement and Nigeria\u0027s continual burden in Sierra Leone\r\nis unacceptably draining Nigeria financially. For our\r\neconomy to take off, this bleeding has to stop. The United\r\nNations needs to do more in providing logistics and\r\nfinancial support to assist regional peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding efforts, as well as enhancing the welfare of\r\nrefugees worldwide without discrimination.\r\nMy delegation believes that it has never been the\r\npurpose of the United Nations Organization to prescribe\r\ndemocracy and change for its members and yet make\r\nlittle or no progress in the democratization of its own\r\norgans, such as the Security Council. My delegation\r\naccordingly urges the General Assembly, during this\r\nsession, to conclude deliberations and reach agreement on\r\nthe modalities for the reform and expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council so that the Millennium Assembly will\r\nadopt them next year — and not later.\r\nHow can the United Nations continue to perpetuate\r\nand justify a situation where Africa is the only continent\r\nwithout a permanent seat in the Security Council? In\r\norder to promote reform and democratization of the\r\nSecurity Council, Africa, with 53 Member States, should\r\nbe allocated at least two permanent seats —\r\ncommensurate not only with the continent\u0027s size and\r\npopulation, but with its track record also of contributing\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nI wish to reaffirm our belief that the United Nations\r\nis the most universal body ever designed for collectively\r\nresolving humankind\u0027s common problems. Our\r\nOrganization has come a long way since its establishment\r\n54 years ago. Although created in a different era and\r\nunder different circumstances, and in spite of numerous\r\nconstraints, the United Nations has continuously sought to\r\nadapt itself to the changes in the international political\r\narena. It has been able to accomplish this to some degree,\r\nbut it remains an institution whose working methods,\r\nprocedures and administrative structure have in many\r\nrespects become outdated.\r\nYet the world as we know it today without the\r\nUnited Nations would be inconceivable. For it has come\r\nto symbolize hope for a better and more secure future for\r\nmany, particularly in the developing areas of the world.\r\nIndeed, though a majority of our countries could not be\r\nmembers when the Organization was created, we are\r\ntoday its strongest defenders and advocates of the ideals\r\nfor which it stands. We believe in the family of nations,\r\nand within that family the strong members have the\r\nresponsibility to protect and strengthen the weaker\r\nmembers.\r\nAt the close of the twentieth century and the\r\nbeginning of the third millennium, there is a need for\r\nstock-taking and for proper assessment of the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nimplementation of previous resolutions emanating especially\r\nfrom the major world summits and conferences which took\r\nplace in this decade. Such an effort would bring us closer\r\nto the realization of the purposes and objectives of our\r\nOrganization. In this regard, I stand before the Assembly\r\nand pledge Nigeria\u0027s continued contributions and positive\r\ncommitment to the ideals of the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President and Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by His Serene Highness Crown Prince\r\nAlbert, Crown Prince of the Principality of Monaco\r\nHis Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert, Crown\r\nPrince of the Principality of Monaco, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Crown Prince of the Principality of Monaco, His Serene\r\nHighness Crown Prince Albert, and invite him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nCrown Prince Albert (Monaco) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate you warmly,\r\nMr. President, on your well-deserved election and to assure\r\nyou of the delegation of Monaco\u0027s full cooperation in\r\nassisting you in the discharge of your lofty mandate. Your\r\nrole in your country\u0027s exemplary struggle for independence\r\nand for the dignity of the Namibian people are deeply\r\nmeaningful for us.\r\nI should like also to thank the members of the General\r\nAssembly for entrusting to my country one of the vice-\r\npresidencies of this fifty-fourth session, at the same time as\r\nMonaco is commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\naccession of His Most Serene Highness Prince Rainier\r\nIII — my father. I wish to assure the Assembly that the\r\ndelegation of Monaco will strive to be worthy of this\r\nhonour and to work closely with the other members of the\r\nBureau — whom I congratulate on their election — and the\r\nmembers of the Assembly, to ensure that this session, the\r\nlast of the century, produces effective, concrete and\r\ntangible results.\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to thank also\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, President of the fifty-third session of\r\nthe General Assembly, for his dedication and accessibility\r\nand for the competence and diplomatic skill with which\r\nhe guided our work.\r\nI should like also to congratulate and warmly\r\nwelcome the three new States Members of the United\r\nNations — the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. The Government and\r\npeople of Monaco are particularly pleased to greet these\r\nthree countries of the Pacific, with which we share a\r\nnumber of concerns about the protection of the oceans\r\nand seas. We assure them of our readiness to enter into\r\nand develop a solid and fruitful cooperation with them.\r\nFinally, I should like most sincerely to express my\r\nsatisfaction, as many have already done from this rostrum,\r\nat the resumption of the peace process in the Middle East\r\nand the immense hopes to which it has given rise.\r\nSince the general debate of the previous session,\r\nmany distressing events have unfolded, some of which\r\nhave had serious consequences that will last for years.\r\nThe conflict in Kosovo, with the thousands of refugees\r\nand the massive suffering that it caused, was one of the\r\nmost obvious. The whole of the United Nations system\r\nwas mobilized, in a way that has certainly never happened\r\nbefore, to assemble the resources required to come to the\r\naid of the populations in distress. The armed intervention\r\nand the decisive role played by the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague, brought\r\nto bear in defence of the principles of humanity and\r\nhuman rights, seem to foreshadow a strengthened\r\ndetermination on the part of the international community\r\nto enforce respect for the fundamental values of justice\r\nand human dignity that inspired the San Francisco\r\nCharter.\r\nWe offer our sincere encouragement to the United\r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo as it\r\nstrives, despite the major difficulties in its way, to\r\nimplement the provisions of Security Council resolution\r\n1244 (1999). We wish courage, perseverance and success\r\nto the men and women responsible for carrying out that\r\nnoble mandate of ensuring security, extinguishing the\r\nflames of hate and restoring good-neighbourly relations\r\namong the communities.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nI should also like to emphasize the crucial role played\r\nby the United Nations in holding the election on self-\r\ndetermination in East Timor and in the protection operation\r\nthat our Organization has recently launched to come to the\r\naid of the civilian population there. We are following\r\ndevelopments on the ground extremely carefully, and we\r\nhope that implementation of Security Council resolution\r\n1264 (1999) will proceed without hindrance or delay.\r\nIn this context, we should recall the very enlightening\r\ndebate held by the Security Council on 12 February on the\r\nissue of the protection of civilians in armed conflict, during\r\nwhich the subject of internal conflicts, which have now\r\nbecome more numerous than those between States, was\r\ndiscussed at length. It was recalled that such conflicts fall\r\nunder the purview of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, whose\r\nfiftieth anniversary we have just commemorated, especially\r\nthe provisions of the Fourth Convention. Article 3, which\r\nis common to all four instruments, imposes rules of conduct\r\nthat are binding on the High-Contracting Parties, whatever\r\nthe circumstances and nature of the conflict. That article\r\ncategorically prohibits any kind of attack on the life and\r\nphysical and moral integrity of the person, as well as the\r\npassing of sentences and the carrying out of executions\r\nwithout previous judgement or indispensable judicial\r\nguarantees.\r\nOn 16 and 17 September, a further debate took place\r\nin the Security Council on the same issue, the positive\r\nresult of which was the adoption of resolution 1265 (1999),\r\nwhich makes considerable demands on both States and the\r\ninternational community as a whole. It stresses in particular\r\nthat it is incumbent on States to put and end to impunity\r\nand to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes\r\nagainst humanity and serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law. The Principality of Monaco unreservedly\r\nendorses these recommendations, which we consider to be\r\nextremely important.\r\nWe have very high hopes for the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court as a means of better\r\npreventing war crimes and crimes against humanity. The\r\nPrincipality of Monaco was one of the first signatories of\r\nthe Statute, which was adopted last year.\r\nIn Kosovo, in East Timor and in conflicts that are\r\noften forgotten or that receive no recognition, particularly\r\nthose in Africa, it is the weakest and the most vulnerable,\r\nparticularly children, who suffer most. With the tenth\r\nanniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights\r\nof the Child taking place on 20 November, it is up to us\r\nnow more than ever to see to it that children, in peace as\r\nwell as in war, are strictly protected from all forms of\r\nviolence and subjugation. Following on from the\r\npresidential statement of June 1998, Security Council\r\nresolution 1261 (1999), adopted on 25 August, will, we\r\nhope, make a decisive contribution to resolving the\r\ndistressing problem of the fate of children in times of\r\narmed conflict.\r\nMy country, which is committed to that end, has\r\nbeen host to a number of international non-governmental\r\norganizations dedicated to the protection of children.\r\nThese associations are working hand in hand with the\r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies. For its part, the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco is actively contributing on a\r\nregular basis to steps taken to improve the lot of the most\r\ndisadvantaged children.\r\nJust as children need to be protected, women, too,\r\ndeserve the keenest attention from the international\r\ncommunity. Many forms of discrimination and\r\ninjustice — indeed, cruelty — including genital\r\nmutilation, which is the cause of much pain and\r\nhumiliation, are still too often tolerated. They represent a\r\nnumber of obstacles to women\u0027s achieving their full\r\npotential. In a report recently submitted to the\r\nSubcommission on the Promotion and Protection of\r\nHuman Rights, a non-governmental organization known\r\nfor its competence and precision denounced the\r\nunacceptable treatment still being endured by women in\r\nmany countries, be they young girls, wives or mothers. I\r\nshould like in this connection to emphasize the high\r\nregard in which we held the high-level debate that took\r\nplace in the Economic and Social Council last July on the\r\nrole of jobs and work in the elimination of poverty,\r\nemphasizing in particular the advancement of women.\r\nWomen\u0027s access to jobs, as well as to education and\r\nprofessional training, has been widely encouraged. It is\r\none of the areas of concern of the Government of the\r\nPrincipality, which is taking specific measures in the\r\nsocial and educational fields in order to deal with the\r\nissue. Respect for equality between men and women in\r\ndaily life, as well as in the development of their\r\nprofessional careers, in both public and private sectors, is\r\nessential if we are to improve the situation of women and\r\ncombat the precariousness and poverty that often affect\r\nthem much more than men. We are particularly aware of\r\nthat. The substantial involvement of women in political\r\nand economic decision-making can also contribute to\r\nensuring greater social justice, while stimulating and\r\nbalancing the economy. The authorities of my country are\r\nconvinced of this and are striving to take steps to adjust\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nand complete the legislation of Monaco so as to ensure that\r\nin every respect it is in conformity with the requirements of\r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women, so that Monaco\r\ncan soon become a party to that essential instrument.\r\nBecause of the complexity and irrevocably globalized\r\nnature of today\u0027s economy, it has become necessary, now\r\nmore than ever, to achieve greater balance at both the\r\nnational and international levels. Existing inequalities,\r\nwhatever their origin, must necessarily be reduced to make\r\nsure that the dangerous gap separating the industrialized\r\ncountries from the most disadvantaged countries does not\r\ngrow wider. The Ministers of Economics and Finance of 44\r\nStates and Governments members of the International\r\nOrganization of La Francophonie were able to devote\r\nthemselves to that subject during their first meeting, which\r\ntook place in Monaco on 14 and 15 April last.\r\nThose leaders, like those who met in Geneva at the\r\nJuly substantive session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, recognized that globalization, if poorly controlled,\r\ncould have serious consequences for the future of all\r\nnations. Stepped up trade and investment, and the adoption\r\nof policies of liberalization — sure engines of growth —\r\nhave not yet enabled everyone to enjoy significant\r\ndevelopment. We must guard against some being barred\r\nfrom progress and from the benefits of the major trends in\r\nthe world economy, something that could have serious\r\nconsequences.\r\nAware of that danger and of the deterioration in\r\ninternational relations it could cause, ministers of the\r\neconomy or of finance of Francophone countries, meeting\r\nin Monaco, recognized the need for better supervision of\r\nthe human and social effects of ongoing economic\r\nprocesses, including structural adjustment policies. They\r\nstressed the importance of maintaining, or indeed\r\nincreasing, official development assistance, while adopting\r\nappropriate measures to encourage private investment. They\r\nindicated their grave concern at the unbearable burden of\r\nexternal debt for many countries. The Government of\r\nMonaco shares that grave concern.\r\nThe Monaco Declaration issued at the end of their\r\nmeeting by ministers of the economy or of finance of\r\nFrancophone countries solemnly recalled the fundamental\r\nlink among economic development, democracy and good\r\ngovernance. The Declaration stressed the importance of\r\nupcoming multilateral trade negotiations, noted the mission\r\nof the World Trade Organization to encompass all members\r\nof the international community, and stressed the importance\r\nof improving the international trading system so that it\r\nwill make a greater contribution to sustainable\r\ndevelopment and to meeting the real expectations of\r\npeoples. It also invited the world financial community to\r\nmaintain its assistance to development, through both\r\nofficial and private contributions.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco, which joined the\r\nIntergovernmental Agency of La Francophonie in\r\norganizing this first meeting, is committed to contribute\r\nactively to implementing the Monaco Declaration and to\r\nencourage the establishment of a permanent Francophone\r\ncentre for gathering and exchanging economic\r\ninformation; the recent summit of heads of State or\r\nGovernment of Francophone countries, held at Moncton,\r\nCanada, from 3 to 5 September, agreed to establish such\r\na centre in Monaco.\r\nSupported by many world leaders, the Jubilee 2000\r\ncampaign to cancel debts that the poorest countries are\r\nfinding it difficult to repay enjoys wide backing. Given\r\ncertain modifications, it seems to us to be of great\r\ninterest, if only because it will enable countries\r\nexperiencing great difficulties to resume unhindered\r\nprogress towards development. Here, my country\u0027s leaders\r\nare duly appreciative of the decision taken at Cologne last\r\nJune by the heads of State or Government of the seven\r\nmajor industrialized countries and of Russia to reduce\r\nsignificantly the external debt of some 40 such countries.\r\nI reaffirm Monaco\u0027s unswerving determination to\r\nmeet its international obligations and its firm commitment\r\nto the values of human rights and humanitarian principles,\r\nand wish to affirm that the highest authorities of my\r\ncountry are devoting close attention to progress in the\r\nsphere of disarmament. The limitation and reduction of\r\nnuclear weapons is a constant concern of the Government\r\nof the Principality. In our view, universal ratification of\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\n(NPT) — which, to our great satisfaction, was indefinitely\r\nextended in 1995 — should be promoted, as should the\r\ncomplete application of the comprehensive safeguards\r\nsystem of the International Atomic Energy Agency,\r\nwhose remarkable International Laboratory of Marine\r\nRadioactivity we have been honoured to host since 1986.\r\nThe year-2000 conference of States parties to the\r\nNPT will be decisive. Here, my country praises those\r\ncountries, some of them close friends, that have made\r\nmajor sacrifices to dismantle a portion of their nuclear\r\narsenals while taking great care with the processing of the\r\nfissile materials extracted from them. We unreservedly\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nshare the view of Governments that favour the formulation\r\nand adoption of international rules to prohibit the\r\nproduction of fissile materials intended for the production\r\nof nuclear weapons and explosives.\r\nThe Government of the Principality considers that\r\ncontrols intended to prevent transfers of materials and\r\nequipment that could be used for the manufacture of\r\nnuclear weapons should be strengthened, but it strongly\r\nfavours improved international cooperation for the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy — given, of course, all the\r\nnecessary precautions with respect to environmental\r\nprotection.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco earnestly hopes for an\r\nearly end to all nuclear-weapons tests; the threat that these\r\nweapons pose to mankind has often, and rightly, been\r\ndenounced. We are convinced that the accession of all\r\nPowers to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) — which my father, the reigning Prince, ratified on\r\n20 November 1998 — would be a giant step towards\r\nlimiting these dreadful weapons of mass destruction. As a\r\nparty to the CTBT, the Principality would wish to see\r\ngreater commitment to that important treaty. We welcome\r\nthe existence of nuclear-weapon-free zones established on\r\nthe basis of arrangements freely entered into by the States\r\nof various regions, and hope that strengthening confidence\r\nand international security will ultimately lead to the spread\r\nof such zones.\r\nLet me recall the keen interest of the Principality of\r\nMonaco in the implementation of the 1993 Paris\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\r\non Their Destruction, to which my country has been a party\r\nsince 1 June 1995, and of the 1972 Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling\r\nof Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\r\nTheir Destruction, our instrument of accession to which was\r\ndeposited on 30 April 1999.\r\nMy country welcomes the measures adopted at\r\nMaputo, Mozambique, last May, at the first Meeting of\r\nStates Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction, which entered into force\r\nin Monaco on 15 March 1999.\r\nEngaged from the very beginning in the fight against\r\nthese deadly devices, which strike hardest at civilian\r\npopulations, particularly the elderly, women and children,\r\nMonaco signed and quickly ratified this instrument. My\r\ncountry is fully determined to continue its efforts to\r\ncontribute to eliminating these weapons once and for all.\r\nWhen, on 12 November 1998, the Principality of\r\nMonaco signed the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombing, it wanted to make a\r\nformal commitment and to place clearly on record its\r\nposition in this regard. Through me, Monaco confirms\r\nthat decision before the Assembly, once again\r\ncondemning all forms of terrorism, which blindly and\r\nmercilessly strikes too many innocents, as we have had\r\noccasion once again to note recently.\r\nIn this spirit, it is appropriate to pay a special tribute\r\nto the United Nations Mission in East Timor for the role\r\nit is playing and for the courage its representatives are\r\ndisplaying, notably the members of the international staff\r\nthat remained in place under the gravest of threats.\r\nIn this connection, I should like once again to\r\nforcefully reaffirm our complete solidarity with United\r\nNations personnel, some of whom this year have lost their\r\nlives, been injured, or suffered violence and other grave\r\noffenses. Monaco, which was among the first countries to\r\nratify the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel, deplores in the strongest terms and\r\ncondemns without reserve the inadmissible acts of\r\naggression and intimidation of which they have been\r\nvictims. We take this opportunity to salute the first among\r\nUnited Nations personnel, the Secretary-General, who\r\nenjoys our highest esteem for his actions at the head of\r\nthe Organization, particularly during periods of crisis and\r\nin the extremely difficult circumstances with which he is\r\nregularly confronted.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Crown Prince of the Principality of\r\nMonaco for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert, Crown\r\nPrince of the Principality of Monaco, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe President: Before calling on the next speaker,\r\nI would like to request representatives to be good enough\r\nto move quietly through the aisles at the end of each\r\nstatement and as they exit and enter the General\r\nAssembly Hall, in order not to disturb the speaker who\r\nhas the floor. I rely on those present to cooperate in\r\nmaintaining order and quiet in the Hall, in keeping with\r\nthe dignity and decorum of Members of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nI now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nCanada, His Excellency The Honourable Lloyd Axworthy.\r\nMr. Axworthy (Canada): Allow me first to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Canadians are proud to have\r\naccompanied you and your people on their journey to join\r\nthe community of nations.\r\nOn behalf of Canada, allow me also to welcome the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga as new Members of the United Nations.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nMr. President, your election is a tribute to your\r\nwisdom and your dedication to the goals of the United\r\nNations. I am convinced that you will guide us well in\r\ncarrying out the work that we are gathered here to do on\r\nbehalf of all of the world\u0027s people.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIndeed, it is we the people for whom the United\r\nNations was founded and its purposes forged. We the\r\npeople, not we the nation States, or the ministers, or the\r\nambassadors, or the Secretariat. Let us recall these lines\r\nfrom the United Nations Charter:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations\r\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war, ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental\r\nhuman rights, ... to establish conditions under which\r\njustice ... can be maintained, and to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\r\n... have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish\r\nthese aims”.\r\nThese are noble words and compelling goals. But do\r\nthey still ring true, or is there a need for new meaning and\r\nnew commitment?\r\nHow would we the people assess the handiwork of the\r\nUnited Nations to date and judge the world scene today\r\nwhen we have seen in the last year alone the brutal ethnic\r\ncleansing of Kosovo, the slaughter and maiming of\r\ninnocents in Sierra Leone, Angola, both Congos and Sudan\r\nand the cruel suppression of the independence agreement in\r\nEast Timor? Or when we see kidnapping and terrorism\r\nplaguing virtually every region, the growing, powerful\r\ninfluence of the drug-traffickers and criminals, the return of\r\nthe slave merchants and the emergence of modern warlords\r\nwho brutalize and exploit communities for economic\r\ngain? Or when we are all subject to the darker side of\r\nglobalization, where international commerce brings new\r\nbut poorly distributed wealth, where helpless children are\r\nrecruited into armies or sold on the internet for exploitive\r\npurposes, where environmental degradation inflicts a high\r\ncost on the smallest countries, which can least afford it?\r\nOur world on the eve of the millennium is\r\nincreasingly shaped by these and a variety of other direct\r\nthreats to people. If we the peoples were to have the\r\nchance to rethink the Preamble to the Charter, we might\r\nwell say that we are determined to save existing\r\ngenerations from the grave new risks to their personal and\r\nfamily security.\r\nIt is true that there is another perspective, one that\r\ngives a glimmer of hope. We could point with some\r\nsatisfaction to the fact that, through the combined efforts\r\nof people working together across borders, there is an\r\nemerging sense of accomplishment in responding to these\r\nnew threats to human security.\r\nAs of today, 86 nations have ratified the Convention\r\non antipersonnel mines, ushering in a legal regime and a\r\nplan of action that will save the lives of thousands.\r\nWorking together last year, 120 nations voted in\r\nfavour of an International Criminal Court, which will\r\nestablish individual accountability for crimes against\r\nhumanity.\r\nIn the field of conflict, the United Nations is now\r\nattempting to rebuild the broken fields of Kosovo after an\r\nunprecedented intervention for humanitarian reasons. And\r\nin East Timor, peacekeepers are bringing order to that\r\nlong-troubled land.\r\nSo we the peoples have not given up in the face of\r\nthe confusion, turmoil and misery which beset our world;\r\nand we still search through the corridors of this building\r\nfor words of cooperation and acts of consensus.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nBut it is not easy, because many forget that it is we\r\nthe peoples, all the world\u0027s people, whom we are here to\r\nserve, not just their particular national interests. Too many\r\nprotect their prerogatives, engage in exclusive power\r\npolitics or refuse to pay their bills, thereby paralysing the\r\ninstitution and rendering it incapable of meeting the\r\nchallenges to our collective well-being.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nIt is difficult to promote an agenda for the security of\r\npeople when some stand opposed, on the basis of a desire\r\nto protect at all costs the sovereignty of the State. Of\r\ncourse, State sovereignty remains a fundamental tenet of\r\npeace and security; but it is not absolute, and it is not a\r\nshield behind which the most egregious violations of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms can be hidden.\r\nIt is time, therefore, for we the peoples represented in\r\nthis Assembly to reassess our influence and make our\r\nvoices heard.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThere is a new road map to lead the way. Last week\r\nthe Secretary-General tabled a report on the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict (S/1999/957) in which he\r\ncaptures many of today\u0027s challenges and sets out 40\r\nrecommendations for action.\r\nThe heaviest burden falls on the Security Council. The\r\nsearch for global peace increasingly turns on issues of\r\npersonal safety. Modern conflict takes a huge,\r\ndisproportionate toll on civilians. In this world, the\r\nprotection of civilians must be central to the Council\u0027s\r\nwork. It must provide the subtext for our future collective\r\naction and the impetus behind our efforts to prevent\r\nconflict, keep the peace, enforce sanctions and support the\r\ncollective will of the United Nations.\r\nThe way ahead is not without obstacles. There are\r\nlegitimate questions about the purposes, limits and\r\nstandards for Council engagement for humanitarian ends,\r\nwhich itself also present difficult contradictions with regard\r\nto the principle of non-interference. Clear and consistent\r\ncriteria are needed against which the necessity or otherwise\r\nof humanitarian intervention — including enforcement —\r\ncan be judged and applied. These tests must be very\r\ndemanding: the basis must be the existence of fundamental\r\nbreaches of international humanitarian and human rights\r\nlaw.\r\nThe human dimension makes it imperative that the\r\nCouncil adapt the blunt instrument of sanctions into a\r\ntargeted tool so that they hurt where they are supposed to\r\nhurt. The Council needs also to show the resolve to\r\nimplement sanctions once they are in place. This is\r\nCanada\u0027s objective as chairman of the Council\u0027s Angola\r\nsanctions Committee established pursuant to resolution 864\r\n(1993) — to develop tougher measures to constrain the\r\ntrade in arms and diamonds, thereby making it more\r\ndifficult for UNITA to wage war. It is time to tackle the\r\nnew war economy in which a direct relationship exists\r\nbetween certain businesses, mercenaries and warlords, a\r\nrelationship that perpetuates misery, conflict and the\r\nvictimization of innocent people.\r\nA human security agenda highlights the urgent need\r\nto face clearly the issue of the Council\u0027s representation\r\nand its decision-making processes, especially the\r\ninappropriate use and persistent threat of the veto where\r\nit can compromise, complicate and slow down\r\ndetermined, urgent international action to protect people.\r\nThe Council needs to come to grips with these challenges\r\nif it is to maintain its credibility in the eyes of the people\r\nit serves. Membership in the Council is a trust, and\r\nCouncil members need to demonstrate their capacity to\r\nmaintain that trust.\r\nThe issues raised by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport on the protection of civilians in armed conflict are\r\nissues that plague all peoples. The Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nproposals in fact go beyond the purview of just the\r\nSecurity Council; the onus for taking action lies with all\r\nMember States. For that reason, I strongly urge that the\r\nGeneral Assembly should begin consideration of this\r\nreport and move quickly to establish mechanisms to give\r\neffect to its recommendations, including a system of\r\nreporting to review implementation. Towards this end,\r\nCanada looks forward to working with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and fellow Member States to establish a “friends\r\nof civilians in armed conflict” group to help guide these\r\nefforts.\r\nTo protect civilians in armed conflict, the Assembly\r\nhas the means to enable the United Nations to act more\r\nquickly; the moral authority to establish universal\r\nstandards that hold us all accountable; and the legitimacy\r\nto direct efforts into new areas of global endeavour. The\r\nability to respond rapidly when the security of civilians is\r\nthreatened is essential. Giving the United Nations a rapid\r\nresponse capability — particularly through the creation of\r\na United Nations headquarters for rapid deployment —\r\nwould be an important step. How much more effective\r\ncould the United Nations have been in East Timor or in\r\nKosovo if such a capability had existed?\r\nThe civilian side of peace operations — the police\r\nand the judges, the civil servants and the human rights\r\nexperts — is also of growing importance, but insufficient\r\ncapacity for rapid deployment is a problem here too.\r\nClearly the “White Helmets” are as critical to building\r\npeace as the Blue Helmets, and they deserve no less of\r\nour attention. Those of us who are able might start by\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nimproving our respective national capacity to make\r\ncontributions to be put at the service of the United Nations.\r\nThis is something my Government has begun and is\r\nworking to improve. Globally binding humanitarian and\r\nhuman rights standards for behaviour and practical\r\nmechanisms to hold transgressors accountable would also\r\nadvance the security of people subjected to the horrors of\r\narmed conflict.\r\nThe adoption of the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court was a qualitative step forward. It will help\r\nto end the culture of impunity and protect all people against\r\nthe most egregious violations of humanitarian law. The\r\nAssembly\u0027s priority now should be to bring the Court to\r\nlife. This means continued cooperation from us all in\r\nbuilding the technical underpinnings of this Court. It also\r\nmeans ensuring prompt and widespread ratification of the\r\nCourt\u0027s Statute.\r\nStrengthened standards and strategies are needed\r\nelsewhere. For example, negotiating the strongest possible\r\noptional protocol on the involvement of children in armed\r\nconflict, which should be accompanied by a comprehensive\r\naction plan, will help to confront one of the most heinous\r\naspects of modern warfare and other conflict.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that more must\r\nbe done to protect humanitarian workers who risk their\r\nlives to help the victims of war. That is why Canada will\r\nbe seeking an additional protocol to the Convention on the\r\nSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel to\r\nprovide legal protection to all personnel working in\r\nsituations of armed conflict, including a broader range of\r\nnon-governmental organizations and locally employed\r\npersonnel.\r\nFinally, the Assembly can direct its efforts towards\r\nmaking the safety of people the emphasis in a wider range\r\nof global endeavours.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe greatest threat to human safety remains the\r\npossibility of annihilation by nuclear or other weapons of\r\nmass destruction. Yet the non-proliferation regime that we\r\nhave painstakingly built over the past 50 years remains\r\nfragile. We should now ensure that the obligations under\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are\r\nrespected, and we should implement the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and reduce the risk that nuclear\r\nweapons pose to our collective security.\r\nHuman security is also the impetus behind efforts to\r\naddress the problem of small arms, which kill in conflict\r\nzones as well as on neighbourhood streets. This is a\r\nglobal challenge that requires a global solution. We\r\nshould therefore convene a conference on the illicit traffic\r\nin small arms, with a comprehensive agenda.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nTransnational crime, including the illicit drug trade,\r\nterrorism and human smuggling, is a closely related\r\nchallenge. It has a direct impact on the safety of all our\r\npeople. The conclusion of an effective United Nations\r\ntransnational organized crime convention and its protocols\r\nwould be a start to providing that protection.\r\nTaken together, those efforts would be a strong\r\nbeginning to orienting the Assembly to meet the real\r\nsecurity needs of people today. I must be very blunt:\r\nimprovement in human security is a necessary condition\r\nfor success in the other important actions that we take to\r\nadvance human, economic, aid and trade development.\r\nFarmers cannot work fields strewn with mines. Children\r\ncannot learn when they are abused and brutalized by war.\r\nInvestors will not send money to regions racked by\r\nconflict. Societies cannot flourish when resources are\r\npillaged to fuel violence and people are victimized by\r\nterror.\r\nUltimately, freedom from fear is intimately\r\nconnected to the freedom from want. And it is freedom\r\nfrom fear for all peoples — which is at the heart of the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report and his recommendations —\r\nthat provides the United Nations with a clear, defining\r\nrole at the century\u0027s close. Our collective efforts towards\r\nthat end will give concrete expression to the hopes and\r\ndreams of the generation that first made “we the peoples”\r\nthe basis for this Organization. Next year\u0027s Millennium\r\nAssembly and summit offer an opportunity to articulate a\r\nvision of the United Nations that places the safety of\r\npeople at the centre of its agenda.\r\nThe United Nations cannot do it all. The challenges\r\nto advancing human safety are complex. Regional\r\norganizations play an important role. Practical cooperation\r\nbetween countries can address specific problems and the\r\nparticipation of members of civil society and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations is also imperative. But\r\nsecurity for all of us begins and ends with a strong,\r\neffective United Nations focused on this goal. We the\r\npeoples should resolve to work together to achieve this\r\nend.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Egypt, His Excellency Mr. Amre\r\nMoussa.\r\nMr. Moussa (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset,\r\nit gives me great pleasure to extend to you, Sir, and to your\r\nfriendly country my sincere congratulations upon your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly. I am fully\r\nconfident that you will steer the work of this important\r\nsession ably and effectively. I would also like to express\r\nmy appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session, for his wise\r\nconduct of the business of that session.\r\nIt also gives me pleasure on this occasion to salute the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his efforts to\r\nmaintain the role of the international Organization, improve\r\nits performance, increase its efficiency and restore its\r\ncredibility and effectiveness. My pleasure is all the greater\r\nin welcoming the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga to membership of the United Nations.\r\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\r\nbeing held at a historic juncture that comes only once every\r\n100 — indeed, every 1,000 — years. This is the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly before the end of the\r\ntwentieth century and of the second millennium since the\r\nbirth of Christ. That century and that millennium have\r\nembodied a combination of mankind\u0027s greatest\r\nachievements as well as catastrophic tragedies.\r\nYes, the second millennium has witnessed momentous\r\nevents. During the last century of this millennium, these\r\nevents have taken place at a pace faster than any recorded\r\nhistory of humanity. The outgoing century has become a\r\ncatalogue of contradictions, some of which bear testimony\r\nto mankind\u0027s genius and others to its ignominies and\r\nimmoralities. All our diverse civilizations, without\r\nexception, have produced warmongers and destructive\r\ntyrants. They have also produced great leaders, advocates\r\nof peace, inventors, creative artists, scientists, explorers and\r\nstatesmen who provided good leadership and gave wise\r\ncounsel.\r\nAccording to the Gregorian calendar, we are at the\r\nclose of a century and a millennium. By the Hijri calendar,\r\nwe are in the fifteenth century after the migration of the\r\nProphet Muhammad, who revealed to the world a noble\r\nreligion and gave it an enlightened civilization. We in\r\nEgypt are approaching the end of the seventh millennium\r\nin the life of an ancient country; a country that is as old as\r\nhistory itself; a country that contributed to the making and\r\nrecording of history. Humanity\u0027s attainments at this time\r\nand in this age are not the fruit of the achievements of the\r\ntwentieth century alone; rather, they are the result of the\r\naccumulated achievements made since the beginning of\r\ntime. The Egyptians excelled at science and engineering\r\nand were the first to profess monotheism. The\r\nBabylonians gave the world the alphabet. The Phoenicians\r\nmastered navigation. The Arab civilization flourished in\r\nal-Andalus, preserved Greek philosophy and added to it.\r\nThe Islamic civilization in Syria, Iraq, Egypt and Turkey\r\nmade great contributions to all aspects of life. The\r\nRenaissance in the Italian city-States followed. Then came\r\nthe French Revolution, advocating the ideals of liberty,\r\nequality, and fraternity. The industrial revolution started\r\nin Britain. America ushered in the computer, information\r\nand communication revolutions and the age of space\r\nexploration and atomic energy. I would also refer here to\r\nthe profound philosophies and great civilizations that\r\nflourished in China, India, Japan and elsewhere.\r\nThis is a necessary statement of fact as we bid\r\nfarewell to this century and this millennium. Everyone\r\nmust be aware that we are all partners in the creation of\r\nthe contemporary genius. Yet the future is our real\r\nconcern. The future brings with it new challenges in the\r\nfields of science and information; economic and monetary\r\nmatters; culture, politics and security; and the conduct of\r\nrelations between peoples and societies. These are some\r\nof the challenges of the coming century. To this list must\r\nbe added the legacy of the unresolved problems of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\nThe end of a century or a millennium does not mean\r\nthe end or solution of existing problems. Indeed, it is a\r\nhistorical juncture and will undoubtedly mark new\r\nchallenges. Problems, like progress, are characterized by\r\ncontinuity. This makes it necessary to agree on a new\r\nforward-looking agenda that anticipates the future, its\r\nexpectations and risks — an agenda that will prepare us\r\nto solve existing and persistent problems.\r\nHere, I hasten to add that new breaths of fresh air\r\nhave begun to blow in various parts of the world. They,\r\ntoo, will accompany us into the coming century. Africa\r\ncontinues to suffer from armed and ethnic conflicts and\r\nthe disruption of development efforts. Yet a serious\r\nAfrican policy is being developed to put an end to these\r\nconflicts and to achieve settlements on the basis of\r\ndialogue, national reconciliation and conciliation between\r\nneighbours. We also note that the African Summit held\r\nlast June in Algiers decided that the countries whose\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nGovernments had taken power by unconstitutional means\r\nmust restore constitutional legitimacy before the convening\r\nof the next African Summit in the year 2000. The Fourth\r\nExtraordinary Summit of the Organization of African Unity,\r\nheld in Syrte earlier this month, reaffirmed the continent\u0027s\r\nresolve to proceed on the path of unity through the speedy\r\nimplementation of a treaty establishing the African\r\nEconomic Community.\r\nOn the Asian continent, the situation in the Korean\r\npeninsula and the question of Kashmir are still sources of\r\ntension and confrontation. Afghanistan remains a source of\r\ninstability and tension and a haven for terrorism. Yet the\r\nAsian economies are showing signs of recovery and are\r\npreparing to compensate for the sacrifices that were made\r\nand the development efforts that were lost as a result of the\r\nfinancial crisis of 1997.\r\nAs for East Timor, the popular consultation held last\r\nAugust reflected, in the words of the Secretary General, the\r\nwill of the people of East Timor for self-determination\r\nwithout representing victory or defeat for any of the parties.\r\nThis process could not have been successful without the\r\nbold initiative of President Habibie. While calling for a\r\npeaceful and orderly transition of power, Egypt pays tribute\r\nto the wise decision of the Indonesian Government to\r\naccept the deployment of an international force in the\r\nterritory. This is a responsible and wise course of action\r\nthat will restore calm and order there.\r\nEurope was the origin and theatre of the two World\r\nWars that were bitterly experienced by humanity in its long\r\nhistory. There, the hateful practices of ethnic cleansing are\r\nagain looming on the horizon. Yet, we have seen the\r\ninternational community take a clear and firm stand against\r\nsuch practices and against attacks on the identity of peoples\r\nand nations. We have also witnessed some progress in the\r\nconstitutional dialogue that aims at resolving the question\r\nof Northern Ireland, the oldest contemporary crisis on the\r\nEuropean continent.\r\nIn the Middle East, the peace process is now heading\r\ntowards a new and positive stage. It is our hope that this\r\nwill lead to a comprehensive, just, and peaceful settlement\r\nthat will establish the Palestinian State, put an end to the\r\noccupation of the Syrian and Lebanese territories and\r\nensure security for all. Thus, an end will be put to this\r\nconflict and its files will hopefully be closed.\r\nDespite its centrality, the Arab-Israeli conflict is not\r\nthe only problem in that vast region. Other problems\r\ninclude that of Western Sahara in northern Africa, the\r\nislands of the United Arab Emirates in the Gulf and the\r\nquestion of Sudan. The latter is high on the list of\r\npriorities of Egyptian diplomacy. For two years now, we\r\nhave been making intensive efforts and establishing\r\ncontacts with both the Sudanese Government and the\r\nopposition in order to achieve comprehensive national\r\nreconciliation and to preserve the unity, identity and\r\nterritorial integrity of that brotherly country. We have\r\nbeen coordinating with Libya, the members of\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and\r\nthe forum of the partners of IGAD to ensure that all the\r\nefforts undertaken in this regard are made in a concerted\r\nmanner.\r\nThe situation of Iraq raises numerous questions. The\r\nmatter does not have a bearing on the Government of Iraq\r\nalone. Rather, it pertains to the Iraqi people, their plight\r\nand the suffering of their children. An objective and\r\npositive review of the status of this important brotherly\r\ncountry has become necessary. This review should\r\nproceed from the premise that there are no eternal\r\nsanctions and that people have the right to resume normal\r\nlife and to surpass the errors of the past and move to the\r\nbright horizons of the future. In so doing, they must fully\r\nabide by the accepted rules of international legality like\r\nall other people.\r\nIndeed, Iraqi policy was erroneous in its invasion of\r\nKuwait. A mistake, however, cannot be corrected by a\r\npolicy which will lead to the collapse of an entire society\r\nor cause a whole country to implode. Therefore, Egypt is\r\nclosely following the current efforts aimed at the\r\nsuspension by the Security Council of the sanctions\r\nwithin the context of an understanding with the Iraqi\r\nGovernment and under the Council\u0027s supervision. This\r\nshould be the first step towards the lifting of the sanctions\r\nin accordance with paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991),\r\nall of whose paragraphs ought to be implemented in full.\r\nI stated earlier that despite the high hopes and great\r\nexpectations pinned on the new century, this historical\r\njuncture does not in and of itself bring the existing\r\nproblems to an end. I am duty-bound to put before you\r\nEgypt\u0027s belief that certain major questions must be given\r\ntop priority on the world agenda. These are: international\r\npeace and security, the question of the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\r\nweapons, eradication of poverty, integration of the\r\ndeveloping countries into the world economy on an\r\nequitable basis, dialogue between and complementarity of\r\ncivilizations, and the question of terrorism. These\r\nquestions transcend time and space in our contemporary\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nworld. Their agreed solutions must be the result of our\r\ncollective thinking and collective action.\r\nIf democracy has become a necessary pillar in the\r\nformation of the political framework of the societies of the\r\nfuture, it must equally constitute the framework of\r\ninternational relations. Thus, it is necessary that the future\r\nworld order be based on consensus, on the convergence of\r\ninterests, on the acceptance of the right of others to make\r\ninitiatives, and on appreciation for the premises from which\r\nthey proceed. All this must be debated in a democratic\r\nspirit here in the General Assembly, within its new and\r\nevolving role.\r\nWhat is indeed necessary is for us to arrive at a\r\nconsensus on the regulation of international life. This\r\ndesired consensus must respect the values, norms and\r\nprinciples that are deeply rooted in humanity\u0027s conscience.\r\nThis consensus must achieve the necessary harmony\r\nbetween individual freedoms, on the one hand, and the\r\ncollective rights to security, stability and development, on\r\nthe other hand. It must foster a creative dialogue and a\r\npositive interaction between policies, cultures and\r\ncivilizations, as it must refute the theory of “The Clash of\r\nCivilizations” and minimize the possibility of the clash of\r\ninterests.\r\nWe believe that the world, particularly at this\r\npromising stage, can ill afford a new conflict or a new cold\r\nwar. Those who propagate the theory that Islam could\r\nbecome the main threat to the West following the collapse\r\nof Communism ignore the fact that Islam is a philosophy\r\nand a way of life. It is not an artificial concoction that\r\ncarries within it the seeds of its demise, as Communism\r\ndid. They wilfully disregard history\u0027s greatest lesson:\r\ninteraction among diverse cultures enriches all cultures,\r\nelevates all civilizations and adds to their vitality and\r\nprosperity.\r\nIt is only logical for most societies in our world today\r\nnot to accept the imposition of a single view on world\r\nproblems. It is also logical for them to reject the view that\r\nthe interests of a sole society should be given precedence\r\nover all others or that the considerations, capabilities and\r\ninterests of a certain civilization should be forced on all\r\nother world civilizations. Therefore, Egypt supports the\r\nresolution adopted by the General Assembly last year, at\r\nIran\u0027s initiative, proclaiming the year 2001 the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. Egypt also\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General\u0027s appointment of a special\r\nrepresentative for this important subject.\r\nAddressing the question of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is not separate from addressing the question\r\nof terrorism. Some thinkers have attempted to brand a\r\ncertain civilization and culture with that affront.\r\nThe phenomenon of international terrorism is not\r\nlinked to any particular civilization, culture or religion. It\r\nrecognizes no boundaries and threatens all societies\r\nequally. It has become a grave danger that we must\r\nurgently combat and eradicate. We have seen acts of\r\nterrorism in all parts of the world with diverse cultures\r\nand civilizations, but the challenge is one and the same.\r\nThe United Nations and many States have gone quite\r\nfar in facing this phenomenon. However, the few\r\nscattered and isolated international conventions and\r\nresolutions that deal with it need an integrated framework\r\nto turn them into a binding legal code. This code should\r\nreflect the concerted efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to combat and contain terrorism and to\r\ndeprive it of any haven or financing.\r\nIn this regard, Egypt renews the call of President\r\nHosni Mubarak to convene an international summit under\r\nUnited Nations auspices. The summit, whose objective\r\nframework and timing must be agreed upon by consensus,\r\nwould be mandated to codify the collective and organized\r\nwill of the international community in dealing with\r\nterrorism and in providing the necessary action to combat\r\nand deter it.\r\nI would like to move to other, equally important,\r\nissues, among which are disarmament and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In doing\r\nso, I must recall the need to observe the priorities\r\nestablished by the international community in 1978.\r\nForemost among these priorities are nuclear disarmament\r\nand the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn this regard, there is a clear need to accelerate the\r\nprocess of nuclear disarmament at the unilateral and\r\nbilateral levels as well as within the Conference on\r\nDisarmament. There is also a need to speedily achieve the\r\nuniversality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nThese considerations impelled the States of the\r\nAlliance of the New Agenda: South Africa, Brazil,\r\nMexico, Ireland, Sweden, New Zealand and my country,\r\nEgypt, to adopt a joint declaration in June 1998. The\r\nAlliance tabled a resolution, which was adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly last year by a large majority, calling\r\nfor the adoption of serious and concrete steps in this\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nregard. The members of the Alliance will continue their\r\nefforts during this session.\r\nOn the regional level, I have repeatedly stated that the\r\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction, which is the\r\noptimum way to ensure the security of the Middle East\r\nregion as a whole, can be achieved only within a\r\ncomprehensive framework applicable to all without\r\nexception. Peace cannot endure with an imbalance of power\r\nor a discrepancy in rights and obligations in matters\r\npertaining to national security.\r\nIn this regard, all the States of the Middle East, with\r\nthe sole exception of Israel, have acceded to the NPT and\r\nthe international regime for the inspection of nuclear\r\nfacilities. This constitutes a source of constant tension. It\r\nnegates to a large extent the effectiveness of the\r\ninternational instruments on non-proliferation and arms\r\ncontrol. It will lead to an arms race. It is illogical to give\r\na special privilege or a certain exception to only one State\r\nin as vast and sensitive a region as the Middle East, and\r\nunder unacceptable pretexts.\r\nSound logic necessitates an end to this exception and\r\ncalls firmly for Israel\u0027s accession to the NPT. This subject\r\nwill force itself on the 2000 NPT Review Conference. The\r\nStates parties to the Treaty agreed in 1995 on an integrated\r\nand comprehensive package to enhance the non-\r\nproliferation regime and achieve its universality. The\r\nextension of the Treaty was but one of the elements of that\r\npackage. I would like to stress here the importance of\r\ngiving top priority at the next Review Conference to\r\ncrystallizing the serious steps for achieving the universality\r\nof the Treaty. The States parties to the Treaty must honour\r\nall the obligations and commitments made in 1995 without\r\nselectivity or discrimination. Egypt and many other States\r\ninsist on that. Otherwise, we will reach a state, which has\r\nactually begun, of suspicion and lack of confidence.\r\nThis will have a grave effect on the credibility of the\r\nNPT regime. It will weaken that regime considerably,\r\nmaking it possible to deviate from its provisions or make\r\nthem subject to exceptions.\r\nTalking of regional security in the Middle East leads\r\nme to address the peace process. Egypt maintains, as it\r\nalways has, that a comprehensive peace based on justice is\r\nthe only durable and stable peace. This means Israel’s\r\nwithdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967, the\r\nestablishment of a State of Palestine with Jerusalem as its\r\ncapital, restoring the legitimate human and national rights\r\nof the Palestinian people and the achievement of security\r\nfor all. The peace process must deal with all the problems\r\nin good faith and with courage. It must not postpone\r\ndealing with or negotiating any item or problem. The\r\npostponement or abandonment of problems is a\r\npostponement and abandonment of peace. This is\r\ndangerous and unacceptable and runs counter to the\r\nframework and spirit of peace. It might even postpone the\r\nestablishment of normal relations between the Arab States\r\nand Israel.\r\nWe had hoped that the Arab-Israeli conflict would\r\ncome to an end before the end of the twentieth century.\r\nThis hope is still alive, since the year 2000 is the last\r\nyear of this century.\r\nThis year we witnessed a human tragedy, the likes\r\nof which we thought was impossible given the progress\r\nthat mankind has achieved before the advent of the\r\ntwenty-first century. Here I refer to the tragedy of\r\nKosovo. While welcoming the adoption by the Security\r\nCouncil of a resolution on the establishment of a\r\nTransitional Administration in Kosovo, we stress the need\r\nfor learning from this tragedy so that succeeding\r\ngenerations will never witness its likes again.\r\nAllow me to address one aspect of this\r\nproblem which pertains to our present discussion — the\r\ndegree to which the rules of international legality, as\r\nrepresented by the United Nations, were observed in a\r\nsituation that pertains to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Here we find that the question of\r\nKosovo was a unique case of international consensus and\r\ndisagreement at one and the same time. There was a\r\nconsensus on the need for immediate action to stop the\r\ngrave crime of ethnic cleansing. At the same time there\r\nwas disagreement on who had the right to act. There were\r\ndifferent approaches, among which is the one we believe\r\nin — namely, that any international action must stem\r\nfrom the Security Council as the competent organ\r\nprimarily responsible for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. If the Council were unable to do so,\r\nthen the General Assembly would be the organ that must\r\ndeal with any threats to international peace and security,\r\nas it represents the common interest of all its members.\r\nOur insistence, and that of many others on the\r\nessential role of the United Nations, has been reflected in\r\nthe following significant message; that regardless of how\r\nthe international order is described, as old or new,\r\ninternational participation in it must take place through\r\nthe United Nations, particularly when the matter concerns\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nIn this context, I would like to refer to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the work of the Organization and to his\r\nstatement made last Monday, in which he reaffirmed the\r\nimportance of strengthening the collective security system\r\nin a manner that would enable the international community\r\nto deal with crises before they spin out of control, and the\r\nprimary role of the Security Council in this regard. The\r\nSecretary-General has put forward a number of innovative\r\nconcepts to develop a “culture of prevention” of crises,\r\namong which is the concept of preventive diplomacy. Thus\r\nfar, no agreement has been reached on the scope of the\r\napplication of this concept since it was first dealt with in\r\n1992 in “An Agenda for Peace”. They also include the\r\nconcept of the preventive deployment of forces, which will\r\nraise numerous questions in view of its connection to the\r\nsovereignty of States. Also included is the call for\r\nhumanitarian intervention and its scope, a suggested role for\r\ntransnational corporations and the concept of the assessment\r\nof the security impact of development policies, which could\r\nopen the door for new conditionalities if these ideas are not\r\ndeveloped democratically, objectively and non-selectively.\r\nThese ideas and suggestions deal with concepts that are not\r\nyet established. This makes it necessary to debate them in\r\nan international format characterized by the highest degree\r\nof openness and transparency. Their formulation and terms\r\nshould be agreed upon by all. We propose officially – and\r\nwe call upon the President of the General Assembly and the\r\nSecretary-General to take the necessary actions in this\r\nregard – to have the General Assembly, or a committee of\r\nthe whole within it, debate these ideas and give them\r\nsubstance. They must be adopted by a consensus of all\r\nStates, and the Secretary-General would be asked to present\r\na report on the results of this debate to the General\r\nAssembly at its next session, in the light of which the\r\nAssembly would take a decision on his suggestions.\r\nThe World Summit for Social Development held in\r\nCopenhagen made the eradication of poverty a top priority\r\nfor international action, because it pertains to the stability\r\nof the international order and its credibility. Yet the\r\nincreasing marginalization of the developing countries,\r\nparticularly that of the least developed countries, most of\r\nwhich are in Africa, threatens to create new lines of\r\nconfrontation between the North and the South. This\r\nconfrontation would be fuelled by unjust economic, social\r\nand development considerations and standards, and it could\r\nnegatively affect international stability.\r\nEgypt, the current Chair of the Group of 15, presented\r\na paper to the eighty-seventh session of the International\r\nLabour Organization reflecting the views of the Group\r\nregarding the negative effects of globalization, the crisis of\r\ninternational markets and the concomitant increase in\r\nunemployment. All these matters must be taken into\r\naccount in the implementation of the Copenhagen\r\nProgramme of Action and the programmes of action of\r\nother major conferences.\r\nWe also note that some developed countries have\r\nadopted protectionist measures under the pretext of\r\nprotection of the environment, respect for human rights\r\nand labour standards. These policies deepen the\r\nimbalances in the international trading system. Here I\r\nmust reaffirm the need for the developed countries to\r\nhonour all their obligations under the Uruguay Round and\r\nthe full implementation of the agreements and resolutions\r\nof that Round before engaging in any new negotiations to\r\nfurther liberalize international trade.\r\nI further reaffirm the importance of strengthening the\r\nrole of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) at its tenth session, to be held\r\nin Bangkok, to achieve a balance between the interests of\r\nthe developed and the developing countries. Here I must\r\nrefer to the role of the international financial institutions.\r\nThis question needs a conscientious review in the light of\r\nthe current changes in the international economic arena.\r\nThe review should make these institutions more\r\nresponsive to the needs of comprehensive development.\r\nIt should ensure the full participation of the developing\r\ncountries in the making of decisions on the reform of the\r\ninternational financial system.\r\nIn conclusion, we look forward to the new century\r\nwith hope; yet the questions surrounding it abound,\r\nforemost of which is that two thirds of the people of the\r\nworld live in a state of underdevelopment and suffering.\r\nHow could we face the challenges of the wars that\r\ncontinue to rage, the continued flows of refugees, war\r\ncrimes that continue to be perpetrated and the dire\r\npoverty of those who cannot have their daily bread or\r\nafford a school to educate their children or a hospital to\r\ntreat them? Any talk about globalization must take all that\r\ninto account.\r\nThese were the challenges of the past. They are also\r\nthe challenges of the present, and will be the challenges\r\nof the future. We will be able to face them only with a\r\nstronger will and a stronger commitment, with a more\r\nobjective way of thinking and more effective mechanisms\r\nfor action. In this way we will arrive at a new social\r\ncontract, usher in a new economic era and forge a new\r\nsecurity consensus for the world of tomorrow.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Chairman of\r\nthe Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization and President of the Palestinian Authority, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Yasser Arafat.\r\nMr. Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\nand President of the Palestinian Authority, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Arafat (Palestine)(spoke in Arabic): Mr.\r\nPresident, it gives me great pleasure to see you presiding\r\nover this new session of the General Assembly after your\r\nlong struggle to gain freedom, along with Sam Nujoma,\r\nNelson Mandela and others who fought to bring an end to\r\nthe era of colonialism, apartheid and foreign occupation.\r\nYour presence here today leading this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly attests to the victory achieved by the\r\npeople of Namibia in the battle for freedom and\r\nindependence. It strengthens the hope of the Palestinian\r\npeople that the dawn of their freedom and the independence\r\nof their homeland, Palestine, is near. Furthermore, the\r\nvictory of your friendly country, Namibia, affirms the\r\nconstructive role played by the United Nations in the\r\neradication of the colonialism that has burdened oppressed\r\npeoples and in enabling them to gain their national\r\nindependence. I call upon the United Nations to continue to\r\nundertake this historic role to eliminate all forms of\r\noccupation and colonialism and to strengthen the\r\nfoundations of peace throughout the world.\r\nAs I congratulate and welcome you, Sir, I would be\r\nremiss if I did not extend our gratitude to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti. It also gives me great pleasure to\r\nexpress our deep appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan, the\r\nSecretary-General, for his distinguished role in leading this\r\ninternational Organization and promoting for world peace.\r\nI also want to congratulate the three new members of\r\nthe United Nations: the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic\r\nof Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Their membership is\r\nan important step towards the realization of the universality\r\nof the Organization.\r\nI address the Assembly today — the representatives of\r\nthe international community — for the second consecutive\r\nyear, seeking the continuation of support for the realization\r\nof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people,\r\nparticularly at this crucial and sensitive stage that lies\r\nbetween us and the declaration of our independent\r\nPalestinian State and sovereignty over our liberated land.\r\nThis requires the strengthening of international efforts in\r\norder to really achieve a just solution to the question of\r\nPalestine, the crux of the Middle East conflict. The\r\ncoming millennium summit, with all the renewed hope\r\nand promising beginning it represents for all people, must\r\nbe a decisive deadline for the achievement of peace in the\r\nMiddle East. We should work collectively and vigorously\r\nto achieve this. I look forward to the participation of\r\nPalestine, as a Member State of the United Nations, in the\r\ndeliberations of the coming millennium summit, and I\r\nhope for and trust in the Assembly\u0027s support for this\r\nPalestinian determination to achieve independence so that\r\nPalestine can assume the position it deserves within the\r\nfamily of nations.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, we concluded the Sharm\r\nel-Sheikh Memorandum with Mr. Barak, the new Prime\r\nMinister of Israel, on 4 September, under the auspices of\r\nPresident Hosni Mubarak, and in the presence of King\r\nAbdullah II, Secretary of State Albright, Mr. Moratinos,\r\nrepresenting the European Union, and Mr. Larsen,\r\nrepresenting Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nThe Memorandum is aimed at the implementation of\r\nall the obligations of the interim period under the Oslo\r\nagreement, the Wye River Memorandum and the Hebron\r\nProtocol, and at the resumption of the final status\r\nnegotiations. This was done with the hope of bringing to\r\nan end the policy of protraction and freezing that was\r\npursued by the former Israeli Government, which\r\ncompletely paralysed the peace process and almost dashed\r\nthe ambitious hopes created by this process for all the\r\ncountries and peoples of the Middle East.\r\nThe Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum serves as a\r\nsource of new hope for putting the peace process back on\r\nthe right track, as it reaffirms the implementation of\r\nexisting agreements and of all the obligations within a\r\nspecific time-frame. In this connection, I extend my\r\ngratitude and thanks to all those who contributed to the\r\nconclusion of the Memorandum, particularly our host in\r\nSharm el-Sheikh, President Hosni Mubarak, as well as\r\nKing Abdullah II and Secretary of State Albright, who\r\nundertook tangible and concrete efforts as a representative\r\nof President Clinton, and the European leaders, their\r\nrepresentatives and their envoys to the peace process. The\r\ncontinuous involvement of these friends in this process\r\nwas essential and necessary for pushing the process\r\nforward. International sponsorship of the Middle East\r\npeace process is the guarantee for its definitive and final\r\nsuccess.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThe absence of such an international role would send\r\nthe fragile situation in the region back to square one. I\r\ntherefore call upon the international community to\r\naccelerate and strengthen its efforts and participation to\r\npush the peace process forward and revitalize it on all\r\ntracks. A just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East\r\ncan last only if it is protected by international legitimacy\r\nand if efforts are undertaken to implement all of the\r\nresolutions pertaining to the Middle East conflict on the\r\nPalestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks.\r\nWe should work hard so that the signing of this\r\nMemorandum will succeed in ending the stagnation of the\r\npeace process and in opening the door that the former\r\nIsraeli Government closed in the face of all serious efforts\r\naimed at achieving real peace.\r\nAs we reaffirm once more our commitment to the\r\npeace process and the implementation of the signed\r\nagreements, we hope that this time the Israeli side will\r\nimplement these agreements scrupulously and honestly,\r\nincluding the phases of redeployment agreed upon in the\r\nWye River and Oslo agreements, the release of prisoners\r\nand the other obligations of the transitional period, such as\r\nsafe passage between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\r\nand the construction of the Gaza seaport.\r\nThe Israeli Government is called upon to immediately\r\nand decisively cease all measures that violate international\r\nresolutions, laws and covenants and thus destroy the\r\nchances of peace. At the forefront of these are the\r\nsettlement activities and the confiscation of land, especially\r\nin AI-Quds Al-Sharif, and its vicinity, and the siege of the\r\ncity of Bethlehem and the rest of the Palestinian territories.\r\nThe continuation of these settlement policies and practices\r\nwill quash the hopes and expectations generated by the\r\nsigning of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum and destroy\r\nprospects for the final settlement negotiations, which began\r\non 13 September. The cessation of all such measures is\r\nneeded in order that we can, together with my new partner,\r\nMr. Barak, continue the march of the peace of the brave\r\nthat we began with two other partners — the late Yitzhak\r\nRabin, who gave his life for this peace, and Shimon\r\nPeres — for a new Middle East.\r\nHence, we look forward to seeing new, real and\r\ntangible changes in the positions and actions of the Israeli\r\nside that will open the door, in word and in deed, for the\r\nachievement of a just and comprehensive peace — a peace\r\nof the brave that will lead to the realization of the right of\r\nthe Palestinian people to self-determination and to the\r\nestablishment of their independent State, with Al-Quds Al-\r\nSharif (Jerusalem) as its capital, and the realization of the\r\nright of the Palestine refugees to return to their homeland\r\nin accordance with resolution 194 (III) which affirms the\r\nright of the refugees to return to their homes and the right\r\nto compensation for those who do not wish to return.\r\nThe realization of the right of the Palestinian people\r\nto establish their independent State with Al-Quds Al-\r\nSharif as its capital will provide the definitive guarantee\r\nfor the establishment of a permanent peace in the Middle\r\nEast. It will also be a validation of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and its numerous resolutions over 50\r\nyears, beginning with resolution 181 (II) which called for\r\nthe establishment of two States in Palestine, one Jewish,\r\nwhich is Israel, and one Arab, which is Palestine. The\r\nrights of peoples do not diminish because of a statute of\r\nlimitations or under oppression, and our people have\r\nproved through the years that they deserve life, freedom\r\nand their own independent State. The time has come for\r\nthe international community, represented by the General\r\nAssembly, to reaffirm this right and to work for its\r\nrealization.\r\nThe goal of the current peace process is the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and the application of\r\nthe principle of land for peace. The latter means total\r\nIsraeli withdrawal from all Palestinian and other Arab\r\nterritories occupied since 1967, including Al-Quds Al-\r\nSharif — the Holy City of Jerusalem, which is the first of\r\nthe two Qiblahs and the third Holy Sanctuary of Islam,\r\nthe place from which the Prophet Muhammad ascended\r\nto heaven, and the cradle of the birth of Jesus Christ.\r\nThe catastrophe that befell our people 51 years ago,\r\nuprooting them from their homeland and dispersing them\r\ninto exile — thereby stripping them of their dreams and\r\nrights as human beings in an attempt to negate their\r\nexistence — is one of the greatest human tragedies\r\nwitnessed by the twentieth century. The question of the\r\nrefugees of Palestine is the oldest and greatest refugee\r\nquestion in our contemporary world. We must recognize\r\nthe legitimate right of those refugees to return to their\r\nhomeland, in accordance with United Nations resolutions.\r\nFour million Palestinians live in exile and in refugee\r\ncamps awaiting the time of their return to their homeland,\r\nfrom which they were forcibly expelled. There is no way\r\nto achieve peace, stability and security in the Middle East\r\nwithout a solution to the question of the refugees of\r\nPalestine and the implementation of resolution 194 (III),\r\nwhich declares their right to return to their homeland.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nTwo essential things must occur for peace to be\r\ncomplete. First, it is necessary to reach a final settlement on\r\nall tracks — the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese — on the\r\nbasis of the complete and precise implementation of\r\ninternational legitimacy, especially Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), and 425 (1978). The\r\nsecond is the provision of economic support and assistance\r\nby the international community sufficient for the\r\nachievement of a better economic situation and for\r\nachieving prosperity in the region. What is required\r\nforemost in this regard is raising the Palestinian economy\r\nup from the miserable situation in which it finds itself as a\r\nresult of the long years of occupation, so that building\r\ncooperative economic relations in the region will become\r\npossible.\r\nHere I wish to thank the donor countries that have\r\nprovided and continue to provide important assistance to the\r\nPalestinian people and to the Palestinian Authority. This\r\nassistance is necessary to enable us to overcome the\r\nimmense difficulties that we have been confronting since\r\nthe establishment of the Palestinian Authority, as a result of\r\nthe closures and sieges imposed by the previous Israeli\r\nGovernment on the Palestinian territory for long periods,\r\nwhich worsened further the total destruction of the\r\nPalestinian economy. The shadows of poverty and\r\nunemployment still threaten our economic abilities and\r\nplans to reconstruct, build and develop.\r\nThe achievement of all of this necessitates the\r\ncontinuation of the constructive efforts of the United\r\nNations, which has permanent responsibility towards the\r\nquestion of Palestine until that issue is resolved in all its\r\naspects. We will also remain in need of our Arab brothers,\r\nthe Islamic countries and our friends in the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement. We will remain in need of the two co-sponsors\r\nof the peace process, the United States and the Russian\r\nFederation, and also of the European Union, China, Japan,\r\nNorway and our other friends around the world.\r\nWe must heighten all our efforts until the arrival of\r\nthe new millennium in many areas and spheres, and not\r\nonly in the Middle East. In this respect, we have observed\r\nsome positive developments which are quite reassuring.\r\nThere is tangible improvement in the area of conflict\r\nresolution on the African continent and on the path towards\r\nachieving better economic and social development in that\r\ngreat continent. There is the international attention given to\r\nKosovo, as well as other measures carried out in the\r\nBalkans. There is also the adoption of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, as well as the additional\r\nconsideration being given to the four Geneva Conventions\r\non the occasion of their fiftieth anniversary. We refer\r\nhere, with appreciation, to the convening of the\r\nConference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention last July regarding the Israeli\r\noccupation of our land. There are also the follow-ups and\r\nreviews of a series of international conferences five years\r\nafter their convening, in addition to the preparations being\r\nmade with regard to such important issues as the culture\r\nof peace and the dialogue among civilizations.\r\nAll of these things are important developments, but\r\nperhaps not enough for us to be able to begin the new\r\nmillennium under new circumstances. This is particularly\r\nso if we look at some of the events and worrisome\r\ndevelopments in different areas. There is the continuation\r\nof the state of siege in Iraq and the profound suffering of\r\nits brotherly people. There is also the continuation of\r\ninternal conflicts in many countries, such as Afghanistan\r\nand others. Recently there have also been worrisome\r\ndevelopments in East Timor. But I would like, in\r\nparticular, to refer to the rise of extreme poverty and to\r\nthe widening gap between the haves and the have-nots on\r\nthe individual, national and regional levels.\r\nPerhaps it is we, the poor people of the South, who\r\nare most concerned about how to bridge the gap between\r\nus and the North, particularly in this era of globalization\r\nof the world economy, whose challenges and\r\nconsequences we must all face. Here we must exert\r\nserious efforts and seek creative means beyond hasty and\r\ntemporary measures. While it is time for the South to be\r\nmore prepared to realize such an achievement, the North\r\nshould also be more prepared for partnership and more\r\nrealistic, effective and just sharing.\r\nIn addition to economic matters, we must also strive\r\nto achieve some needed improvements at the political\r\nlevel, particularly with regard to international political\r\nrelations. It is imperative in this connection that we all\r\ngive greater significance to the United Nations. This must\r\nbe done in order for this body to truly and urgently\r\nbecome the effective centre of international and political\r\nrelations and the source of international legitimacy. It is\r\nalso necessary to be wholly committed to upholding the\r\nprinciples and provisions of the Charter of the United\r\nNations and of international and humanitarian laws, as\r\nwell as ensuring that they apply to all. We should apply\r\nto others the same moral values as we accept for\r\nourselves. There should be one set of criteria and one\r\nstandard for all cases and in all places. All of this will\r\nlead to a more credible system of international relations,\r\nin which the incentive to commit wrongs will be lessened\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 10th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nand the collective capability to confront and prevent those\r\nwrongs will, in turn, be enhanced.\r\nIt is with great pride that I would now like to speak of\r\nthe Bethlehem 2000 celebrations. The Palestinian city of\r\nBethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, is the place\r\nwhere we are making preparations to celebrate the end of\r\nthe second millennium and the beginning of the third. It is\r\nalso there, in Palestine, that the past, the present and the\r\nfuture will meet in a global vision of hope for all peoples.\r\nIt is a religious and spiritual occasion of high importance,\r\nnot only for our people and the other peoples of the region,\r\nbut also for all the faithful around the world and for the\r\nentire international community. I appreciate the unanimous\r\nadoption last year of the resolution concerning this great\r\nand important matter, and invite the Assembly to continue\r\nto grant it its attention and consideration this year.\r\nHere, I wish to extend once again the Palestinian\r\npeople’s invitation to the Assembly and to all the leaders\r\nof the world to visit us during this important spiritual and\r\nreligious occasion in Bethlehem, Jerusalem and the other\r\nreligious and spiritual places, so that we can proudly live\r\ntogether in peace at this special, historic time.\r\nI should like to extend my gratitude to the\r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\r\nthe Palestinian People, to the Committee’s Chairman,\r\nAmbassador Ibra Ka of Senegal, to the Special\r\nCommittee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the\r\nHuman Rights of the Palestinian People and other Arabs\r\nof the Occupied Terrotiries and to all the staff members\r\nof this international Organization working in programmes\r\nrelating to the question of Palestine. They have all\r\nprovided immeasurable support to the just cause of the\r\nPalestinian people and have most certainly contributed to\r\nadvancing the peace process towards the achievement of\r\na just, permanent and comprehensive peace — a peace of\r\nthe brave that will secure justice and freedom for the\r\nPalestinian people and their sovereignty over their land,\r\nalong with security, stability and peace for all countries\r\nand peoples of this region.\r\nOnce again I express my congratulations to you, Mr.\r\nPresident, and my gratitude to all the members of the\r\ninternational community, reiterating to you the appeal of\r\nPalestine — an appeal of right, justice and peace.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Chairman of the Executive Committee\r\nof the Palestine Liberation Organization and President of\r\nthe Palestinian Authority for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Palestine Liberation Organization\r\nand President of the Palestinian Authority, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
