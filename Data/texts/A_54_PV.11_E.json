(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Equatorial\r\nGuinea.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of\r\nEquatorial Guinea, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of Equatorial Guinea, His Excellency\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At the outset, we would like to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your outstanding election to guide our\r\nwork during the fifty-fourth session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly and, through you, to pay a well-deserved\r\ntribute to your country, the Republic of Namibia. My\r\ncountry subscribes to the generally held view that your\r\nwell-known diplomatic skills and broad experience will\r\ncontribute to the success of our work.\r\nWe also warmly congratulate the new Member States,\r\nKiribati, Nauru and Tonga, on their admission to the great\r\nfamily of the United Nations. This is a great victory for the\r\nprinciples of free expression and self-determination of\r\npeoples and nations. That is the only way to enrich the\r\ndemocratic nature of the United Nations with the diversity\r\nand universality of mankind.\r\nIt is with optimism and hope that we participate in\r\nthis session of the General Assembly. We reaffirm our\r\nfull commitment to the purposes and principles that were\r\nthe basis for the establishment of the world Organization.\r\nWe believe that its more than 50 years of existence,\r\nwhich have made their mark on the twentieth century and\r\nhave helped bring about great social, political, economic\r\nand technological changes, constitute a positive legacy for\r\nthe future of mankind.\r\nWe have high hopes for this session because those\r\nlong years of experience and the fact that we are about to\r\nenter the third millennium mean that we can talk of a\r\nUnited Nations jubilee for the new era, in which mankind\r\nshould fully benefit from our achievement of the goals\r\nand ideals of a world of peace, free from war and\r\nconflict. We want all men and women to be able to enjoy\r\ntheir most inalienable rights — to freedom, dignity and\r\nequality — and we want all the world\u0027s nations and\r\npeoples to live in justice and equity. Ultimately, we want\r\nall human beings, without distinction and without\r\ndiscrimination, to enjoy the benefits of economic, social\r\nand cultural progress.\r\nBut in spite of these long years of history, the end\r\nof the cold war, our long experience and the many events\r\nthat have taken place in this half-century process —\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nadvances in the new technologies of space exploration,\r\natomic science, remote sensing and other progress that is of\r\nincalculable value for the future of mankind — we note\r\nwith concern that we have yet to guarantee peace and\r\nsecurity for all nations.\r\nThat is why we must adopt strategies and measures\r\nthat will enable developing countries to take advantage of\r\ntheir opportunities for progress and that will make it\r\npossible for all people to enjoy the best possible living\r\nconditions on this, our home planet. We must make sure\r\nthat, as our common heritage, education, science and\r\ntechnology reach all people so that human development can\r\nenable them to enjoy their rights to dignity and\r\nresponsibility. We must examine our consciences and\r\nunderstand that it is we ourselves who are slowing the\r\nadvance of human progress.\r\nThe desire for power and world hegemony,\r\nexacerbated by extremism, ethnic and racial discrimination\r\nand intolerance and fanaticism born of political beliefs and\r\ntheories, has created a climate of war, terror and insecurity\r\nin many parts of the world and could unleash a new world\r\nconfrontation. The most striking examples of this may be\r\nseen in the situations in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, the\r\nMiddle East, Africa and Latin America, as well as in the\r\nrecent escalation of violence in South-East Asia.\r\nMoreover, despite the demands of third-world\r\ncountries and the attempts to establish a new world\r\neconomic order that would be more just and equitable for\r\nall, the present unjust economic system continues to prevail,\r\nimpeding trade between the North and the South. We must\r\nrealize that the economic situation is an irreplaceable\r\nelement of the balance of domestic and international peace\r\nand security: peace does not mean the mere absence of\r\nhostilities; it is a state of perfect harmony in human life in\r\nthe economic, social, cultural and moral spheres. For Africa\r\nand for the Africans, political idealism can flourish only if\r\nit is attended by concrete action that will guarantee human\r\nsurvival and justify the aims of that idealism. Let us not\r\nforget that political idealism of any kind is based on a\r\nculture appropriate to the population in question. Here,\r\nhuman beings are the raw material, and the proper\r\nconditions must be present for the success of that kind of\r\nideal political system. Hence, so long as the peoples of\r\nAfrica suffer from hunger, poverty, war and pandemic\r\ndisease, and so long as they are overwhelmed by cultural\r\ndeficiencies, ignorance and illiteracy, efforts to democratize\r\ntheir States and ensure peace will always fail.\r\nIt is said that an empty sack cannot stand by itself.\r\nAfrica needs economic inputs, technology transfer for\r\ndevelopment, and recognition of its cultural and moral\r\nvalues, so that internecine struggle will cease and so that\r\ndemocracy and political theories will be employed in the\r\nmost objective way.\r\nThat is why Central African heads of States\r\nmembers of the Economic Commission of Central African\r\nStates and of the Central African Economic and Monetary\r\nCommission, meeting at Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, from\r\n23 to 26 June 1999, carefully studied all these factors and\r\nadopted, inter alia, strategies to prevent conflict in the\r\nregion. They decided to establish a subregional\r\nparliament, a peacekeeping force and an institute for the\r\npromotion and defence of human rights. We hope that the\r\nUnited Nations will support these decisions.\r\nThe reality is that in Africa there is strong pressure\r\nfrom underdevelopment, poverty, unemployment and\r\nilliteracy which justifies the flight of intellectuals and the\r\ncurrent exodus of Africans to developed countries in\r\nsearch of a livelihood. Accordingly, we call for United\r\nNations support for the decision adopted in Algeria by the\r\nheads of State of Africa to increase humanitarian support\r\nfor the millions of African refugees, to amounts\r\ncomparable to those given other regions.\r\nThis is also for me a favourable opportunity to\r\nreaffirm our solidarity with the political will and the\r\ndetermination of the African States to speed up the\r\nmechanisms for integration and unity, to meet the\r\nchallenges of globalization in order to ensure global\r\ndevelopment for mankind. In order for political and\r\ndemocratic systems to succeed in Africa, the economy\r\nand economic culture should have a key role among the\r\nelements that go along with them, for otherwise they\r\nwould develop without any objective basis.\r\nUnfortunately, we find that currently there is no firm\r\npolitical will for cooperation between the North and\r\nSouth, as there was in the past. In fact, now there is just\r\na clash of various selfish interests in which the strongest\r\nor the richest always win.\r\nAt this time we recall the great projects of economic\r\ncooperation in post-war Europe which enlivened Europe,\r\nSouth-East Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.\r\nAttempts of the same kind have been sought for Africa\r\nwith the construction of considerable infrastructure to help\r\nthe peoples of this continent: for example, the Aswan\r\ndam in Egypt, hydroelectric power stations on the Volta\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nRiver in Ghana, in Inga in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and in Mombasa in Tanzania. Unfortunately, this\r\npolitical will to aid the development of the continent has\r\nnot continued.\r\nThis, then, is the high price for the independence of\r\nAfrican nations. The political development of the continent\r\nis now confronted with a number of difficulties and\r\nchallenges.\r\nFirst is the need to establish sincere industrial\r\ncooperation with developed countries, instead of the present\r\nmerciless extraction of natural resources and their\r\nexportation as raw materials, with no compensatory\r\nexchange for technologies to process them.\r\nSecondly, there is need to achieve fair prices in the\r\nexchange of natural resources for manufactured goods, as\r\nprices have not gone up more than 25 per cent since\r\nindependence.\r\nA third challenge is that credit is given under\r\nconditions that do not allow the population to satisfy its\r\nneeds nor to profit from corresponding investments, the\r\ndebt for which is mortgaging the economy.\r\nFourth, conditions are imposed on cooperation using\r\npolitical criteria that do not take into account the reality of\r\nAfrican societies, as well as another series of conditions\r\nthat funnel the benefits of the current international\r\neconomic system to a powerful few.\r\nNonetheless, we recognize and are grateful for the\r\ndecision by the seven major industrialized countries to retire\r\nthe debt of developing countries. We cherish the hope this\r\npolitical will may spread to all donor countries and that its\r\napplication will not be according to selective and\r\nexclusionary criteria.\r\nPraiseworthy in the same way is the initiative by the\r\nAdministration of the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica to increase American investment in Africa, an\r\ninitiative which we hope will be a second Marshall Plan for\r\nthe African continent.\r\nCertainly, the consequences of selfishness and of\r\nunfair distribution of available resources have created, in\r\nthe developed as much as in the developing countries,\r\nfrustrated groups of people who today are a cause of\r\npolitical and social instability in many parts of the world.\r\nWith respect to human resources, we must analyze\r\nin depth the causes of the current juvenile delinquency,\r\norganized crime, rape, kidnappings and indiscriminate\r\nkillings, drug addiction and drug trafficking, alcoholism,\r\nprostitution, money laundering, counterfeiting, terrorism\r\nand corruption which exist at all social levels everywhere.\r\nAll these practices challenge us and compromise the\r\nfuture of humanity.\r\nOur concern is that these behaviours make up our\r\nlegacy for the generations of the third millennium. Does\r\nthe new epoch to which we aspire beginning in the year\r\n2000 presuppose the rise of some and the regression to\r\npoverty and misery of others? Can international peace and\r\nsecurity guarantee protection only for some, denying it to\r\nothers?\r\nEquatorial Guinea does not aspire to hegemony or\r\npower, yet we speak here with the conviction of the\r\nobligation that falls to us as a member of this democratic\r\ninternational community to ask for what is best for\r\nmankind.\r\nSocio-political development and technological\r\nadvances tell us that we are in a different galaxy from\r\nthat of earlier times. The United Nations is the only\r\nOrganization that has exercised leadership in the process\r\nof the world\u0027s development. Yet after 54 years, we must\r\nrealize that the terms of reference of the world\u0027s current\r\nsocio-political reality are not those in effect in 1945. It is\r\nclear that the United Nations is similarly undergoing\r\nchanges which correspond to this moment in history, in\r\nsocial philosophy, mechanisms, structure and action.\r\nToday we talk of democracy as the only way to\r\npromote the development of peoples, ensure peace and\r\nguarantee respect for human dignity. Today we talk of\r\nglobalizing world politics and policies and of the\r\ngovernance of States because the concept of social\r\ndevelopment finds its justification only in the values of\r\nthe individual. The United Nations should therefore take\r\nno action that is not in keeping with those values and is\r\nnot a faithful expression of this interdependent, unipolar\r\nworld that calls for unified criteria. We must make a\r\nspecial effort to help young people so that they can carry\r\non the positive values of humankind for the sake of a\r\nmore integrated, more developed, more just and more\r\nequitable world.\r\nThe ideal of any governments must be to seek peace,\r\nprogress and prosperity for its peoples. In this connection,\r\nthe efforts of the countries that are fighting to\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\ndemocratize their societies be properly appreciated and\r\nsupported by countries with longer democratic experience.\r\nIt has been proved that penalizing governments and peoples\r\nis counterproductive and makes them unable to promote\r\nnational development however much they want to. The\r\nUnited Nations ought to assist these countries closely in\r\ntheir economic, social, technical and cultural advancement,\r\nin keeping with the spirit of globalization and the actual\r\nsituation in each country.\r\nWe believe that the current United Nations system is\r\nobsolete in terms both of decision-making and of the\r\neffectiveness of its actions when it comes to dealing\r\nproperly with the difficulties and challenges facing its\r\nmembers. Indeed, the proliferation of peacekeeping\r\noperations in various parts of the world is proof that the\r\ncurrent conflict-prevention system is obsolete.\r\nAs an organization founded on democracy, the United\r\nNations must establish the principle across the board that all\r\nparties must be given a hearing in all bodies, including the\r\nSecurity Council, that take decisions affecting its Members.\r\nMoreover, the most sophisticated nuclear technology should\r\nbe employed exclusively as a common shared possession to\r\nbe used for the benefit of all humankind rather than as\r\nprivate property that benefits some to the detriment of\r\nothers.\r\nWe believe that in globalizing world politics and\r\npolicies, which is positive in theory in that it unifies socio-\r\npolitical criteria, States should nevertheless implement the\r\nphilosophy by adopting specific measures that are in\r\nkeeping with the specific characteristics of each country. In\r\nthis connection, Equatorial Guinea has particular experience\r\nin implementing its programme of transition to a multi-\r\nparty system by applying the theory of the democratic test,\r\na way to involve the people in taking all the political\r\ndecisions that affect them. As a result, our transition has\r\nbeen peaceful, orderly and calm because our people\r\nthemselves, no one else, are responsible for the measures\r\nadopted, which all political actors must respect.\r\nA progressive and continuous process of adaptation by\r\nthe authorities and by the people themselves is needed so\r\nthat they acquire the right sort of culture in which human\r\nrights and democracy can be respected. In that connection,\r\nwe welcome the efforts by the Commission on Human\r\nRights to adopt a special assistance programme for\r\nEquatorial Guinea to promote and ensure respect for human\r\nrights there.\r\nWe are party to all the human rights treaties and\r\nconventions and have adopted a wide-ranging framework\r\nof laws and regulations to protect human rights. However,\r\nthe lack of infrastructure makes it difficult for the people\r\nto enjoy in full the various services to which they are\r\nentitled.\r\nI would conclude by making clear our political\r\nresolve to contribute to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, promote close friendship and mutually\r\nbeneficial cooperation between all States and promote\r\neconomic, scientific and technological development\r\nthroughout the world. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nstands open to the world as a peaceful State that puts\r\ndialogue and negotiation first, rejecting force of any kind\r\nas a means of resolving conflicts.\r\nWe hope that the year 2000, which is almost on us,\r\nwill become a milestone in establishing a world truly\r\ncommitted to peace, progress and prosperity for\r\nhumankind.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI thank the President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of\r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Pakalitha\r\nBethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister of Lesotho\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Lesotho.\r\nThe Right Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili,\r\nPrime Minister of Lesotho, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of Lesotho, The Right Honourable\r\nPakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Mosisili (Lesotho): I extend my sincere and\r\nwarm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nsession. It is indeed gratifying to see a distinguished\r\nstatesman and son of Africa lead the Assembly, especially\r\none whose country was born out of the crusade of the\r\nUnited Nations for the freedom of colonial peoples. Your\r\npersonal devotion and commitment to the liberation struggle\r\nof the people of Namibia makes you eminently qualified to\r\nlead the United Nations in its search for peace. I am\r\nconfident that your experience, talent and energies will\r\nensure a successful outcome for the work of the session,\r\nand I assure you of my country\u0027s support in all your\r\nendeavours.\r\nI also pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, for the excellent manner in which he\r\ndischarged his duties as President of the Assembly at its\r\nlast session.\r\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I extend my\r\ncountry\u0027s gratitude and support for his tireless efforts in the\r\ndaunting task of finding lasting solutions to problems that\r\nface our Organization. We particularly commend him for\r\nhis latest brave efforts in East Timor.\r\nPermit me also to express my delegation\u0027s profound\r\njoy at seeing three States join the ranks of the Members of\r\nthe United Nations. The addition of the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga\r\nto our Organization brings closer to fruition the hope of the\r\ninternational community to see the United Nations\r\ncomprising all the countries of the world. We say welcome\r\nto these new Members and extend to them a hand of\r\nfriendship.\r\nI also wish to express my satisfaction with the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s trenchant report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. In particular, I concur with his analysis of the\r\nmoral dilemma that faces the United Nations when the\r\nSecurity Council is unable to act, because of a lack of\r\nconsensus, in the face of the most heinous human rights\r\nviolations. In those circumstances, and while conflicts\r\ncontinue unabated in different parts of the world, the\r\ncapacity of the international conflict-resolution machinery\r\nis put to a severe test. Perhaps no conflict has done this as\r\nintensely as the one in Kosovo.\r\nThe Kosovo crisis represented the very disturbing\r\ntrend towards the most serious violations of human rights\r\nin the form of ethnic cleansing and impunity. After the\r\nexperience of Bosnia, which is still so fresh in our minds,\r\nthe world could not be expected to sit back and take no\r\naction. It would indeed be a sad comment on the efficacy\r\nof the United Nations if the next millennium were to begin\r\nunder a cloud of tolerance of impunity in the face of\r\nacknowledged genocide and other gross violations of\r\nhuman rights. While it is recognized that the conflict was\r\nan internal matter of Serbia, the dilemma was whether the\r\nworld could sit idly by and watch a people being\r\nexterminated.\r\nThe more difficult question that Kosovo raises is the\r\none of the role of the Security Council in similar crises.\r\nThe Charter places responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security squarely in the hands of\r\nthe Security Council. That body must therefore discharge\r\nthis function with seriousness and firmness. It must resist\r\nthe temptation to view questions of international peace\r\nand security through the lenses of national fears and\r\npreoccupations. If it is paralyzed by parochial interests,\r\nthe temptation to take unilateral action increases. The\r\nbelated submission of the Kosovo issue to the jurisdiction\r\nof the Security Council is therefore very welcome, as is\r\nthe United Nations involvement through its civilian\r\nadministration.\r\nIn a similar vein is the tragedy that is East Timor,\r\nwhose denouement seems happily to be in sight. After\r\nmany years of inconclusive attempts to find a solution to\r\nthe problem of East Timor, the new Government in\r\nJakarta finally paved the way by allowing the people of\r\nthat sad country to exercise their right to choose. The\r\ncruel violence that was unleashed against them, however,\r\nwhen they did express their preference in unequivocal\r\nterms is a source of great dismay. We are grateful,\r\ntherefore, that an international peacekeeping force has\r\nnow entered the country and hope that it will bring the\r\nnightmare of the people of East Timor to an end. We call\r\non the Government of Indonesia to bring to book the\r\nperpetrators of violations of human rights. We look\r\nforward to welcoming East Timor in the councils of\r\nindependent States in accordance with the wishes of its\r\npeople.\r\nThe last decade of the twentieth century has been a\r\ntime of momentous changes in all parts of the world,\r\nparticularly in Africa, where for the first time\r\nunprecedented democratic changes and reforms have\r\ntransformed the political landscape across the continent.\r\nWe remain concerned, however, that the proliferation of\r\nconflicts in Africa has had a serious negative impact on\r\nour development capacities, as these conflicts have\r\nundermined efforts to improve the living conditions of our\r\npeoples and retarded progress towards Africa\u0027s economic,\r\nsocial and political transformation.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThe situation in Angola continues to be a source of\r\nconcern for the people of Africa in general and the\r\ncountries of southern Africa in particular. As UNITA\r\ncontinues to perfect its war machine and effort, the\r\nprospects for peace have become more elusive. The people\r\nof Angola have endured hardship for more than 40 years,\r\nwhen the years of the civil war are added to those of a very\r\nbrutal colonial war. There are millions of adults in that\r\ncountry who have never lived in a state of peace. Their\r\ncountry is richly endowed with resources, and yet these\r\nhave not been harnessed for combating the many evils\r\nfacing the country, but have, on the contrary, been used for\r\nprosecuting a war that has impoverished the people beyond\r\nmeasure.\r\nThe States of southern Africa will continue to search\r\nfor a solution to the Angolan crisis. In this regard, they\r\nexpect to receive the support of the international community\r\nin the form of intensified sanctions against UNITA and its\r\nleader, Mr. Savimbi, and increased humanitarian assistance\r\nfor the victims of the conflict.\r\nThe crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nhas equally been a source of concern for the countries of\r\nsouthern Africa since its inception, in view of its\r\nimplications for the security of the region as a whole.\r\nVarious efforts made under the auspices of the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), coordinated by\r\nPresident Chiluba of Zambia, in collaboration with the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the United Nations\r\nand other interested parties, have started to bear fruit with\r\nthe signing of a Ceasefire Agreement in Lusaka on 10 July\r\n1999 by the heads of State of Angola, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and\r\nZimbabwe. The signing, finally, of this Agreement by the\r\nrepresentatives of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy\r\nshould help to pave the way for a permanent and peaceful\r\nsolution.\r\nOn the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, we wish\r\nto commend the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nSecretary-General for his untiring efforts to find a durable\r\nsolution to the problem. We believe that the OAU\r\nFramework Agreement remains the only viable option for\r\nthe resolution of that unfortunate conflict. We, therefore,\r\nappeal to the two parties to the conflict to implement, as\r\nsoon as possible, the technical arrangements worked out by\r\nthe OAU, the United Nations, Algeria and the United\r\nStates.\r\nWe continue to support the United Nations efforts to\r\nhold a referendum to determine the true wishes of the\r\npeople of Western Sahara and once more appeal to the\r\nGovernment of Morocco to assist the process and ensure\r\nits success in accordance with the will of the Saharawi\r\npeople.\r\nIn Sierra Leone we welcome the ceasefire that has\r\nbeen arranged under the auspices of the President of\r\nTogo. However, the settlement raises some troubling\r\nquestions. It is difficult to accept that those who hold\r\ngrievances against a legitimately elected Government can\r\nshoot their way into power-sharing, especially when they\r\nhave been accused of the most chilling atrocities, as\r\noccurred in Sierra Leone. Certainly those who are\r\naggrieved have a right to challenge the governance of\r\ntheir Government, but this should be done within the\r\nlimits of constitutional order and propriety. In spite of\r\nthese reservations, we wish the people of Sierra Leone\r\nwell and will continue to support their efforts to establish\r\nlasting peace in their country.\r\nWe also wish to congratulate the countries of West\r\nAfrica under the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) for the\r\nsacrifices they have made to bring about peace in their\r\nneighbourhood.\r\nRegarding Palestine, all peace-loving people dream\r\nof the day when the permanent status negotiations will\r\ncommence and soon be followed by a permanent peace\r\nand a permanent State for the Palestinians. We therefore\r\nencourage the parties to the Middle East conflict to\r\npersevere in their quest for the attainment of the goal\r\nwhich has eluded them for so long.\r\nThe need to secure our global neighbourhood has\r\nnever been greater. Unfortunately, the threat of weapons\r\nof mass destruction continues to bedevil our hopes for a\r\npeaceful world, and there does not seem to be a global\r\ndetermination to eliminate these weapons. This is so\r\ndespite the fact that over the years this Assembly has\r\nadopted numerous resolutions on the issue of arms control\r\nand disarmament and in particular on the establishment of\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones in different regions of the\r\nworld. Unless the United Nations of the future is able to\r\nmake significant progress in nuclear disarmament, it runs\r\nthe risk of losing credibility as an institution dedicated to\r\nthe pursuit of peace. The United Nations of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, therefore, should be one which can give\r\nhumankind hope for a world of diminished poverty and\r\nno threat of a nuclear war.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nTomorrow, 24 September, marks the third anniversary\r\nof the opening for signature of the Comprehensive Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT). It has long been accepted that the future\r\ncredibility of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) will depend on the effective\r\nimplementation of the CTBT. Convinced of the need to\r\nenhance the institutional fabric of the CTBT, Lesotho\r\ndeposited its instrument of ratification of the CTBT with\r\nthe Secretary-General earlier this month, thus joining the\r\nsteadily increasing number of States that have so far ratified\r\nthe Convention. Lesotho supports the holding of the special\r\nconference on the CTBT, as envisaged under article 14 of\r\nthat Treaty, with a view to accelerating its ratification.\r\nIn the midst of all these conflict situations is the\r\ndramatic and unacceptable deterioration in the level of\r\nadherence to the norms of humanitarian law as opposite\r\nsides to a conflict indiscriminately and ruthlessly employ\r\nany and all means that might advance their ends. Civilian\r\npopulations have become the main targets and direct\r\nvictims of fighting between hostile armies, with women and\r\nchildren suffering disproportionately from atrocities that\r\ninclude rape, sexual exploitation, murder and the mutilation\r\nof civilians.\r\nThe plight of the victims of these heinous crimes\r\nunderscores the imperative for the creation of a new\r\njudicial body that would extend the rule of law in its\r\nbroadest conception. Following the overwhelming\r\nendorsement by 120 nations in Rome last summer of the\r\nidea to set up an International Criminal Court, the early\r\nestablishment of the Court is now a top priority. It is\r\ngratifying to see that just over a year since the conclusion\r\nof the Rome Treaty 86 States have reaffirmed their\r\ncommitment to the Court by signing the Treaty, while four\r\nhave already ratified it. My Government remains committed\r\nto the early establishment of the International Criminal\r\nCourt and has every intention to abide by the terms of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court Treaty and will ratify it soon.\r\nIn his report “Renewing the United Nations: A\r\nProgramme for Reform”, of 14 July 1997, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral proposed the holding of a Millennium Assembly\r\nwith a summit segment in the year 2000, at which heads of\r\nState and Government could “come together to articulate\r\ntheir vision of prospects and challenges for the new\r\nmillennium and agree on a process for fundamental review\r\nof the role of the United Nations.” (A/51/950, para. 91)\r\nFor us in the developing world, the most crucial\r\nquestion facing the international community is how to\r\nbridge the huge gap between the haves and the have nots of\r\nthis world. Unless we redouble our efforts in this regard,\r\nour endeavours to curb such social ills as crime will be in\r\nvain. By the same token, illegal immigration in search of\r\nbetter living conditions elsewhere, which is the direct\r\nconsequence of economic inequalities, will continue to\r\nincrease. It behooves us all, therefore, to treat the problem\r\nof poverty with all the seriousness it deserves, and this\r\nfact must be reflected in the deliberations during the\r\nmillennium summit.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council deserves our\r\ncongratulations for highlighting the problem during both\r\nits high-level and operational activity segments this year.\r\nOf course, the problem of poverty has received United\r\nNations attention on several occasions, most prominently\r\nduring the social summit of 1995 in Copenhagen, when\r\nthe target of halving absolute poverty by the year 2015\r\nwas agreed. Nevertheless, the problem is still with us and\r\nthere are no signs that it is abating; hence the need to re-\r\ndedicate ourselves to that noble goal.\r\nAs is well known, Lesotho is one of the least-\r\ndeveloped countries. It is in recognition of that fact that\r\nwe are committing a considerable proportion of our\r\nmeagre resources to the war against poverty. Among\r\nother measures, we have decided to tackle educational\r\ndeficiency in the country, which is one of the main\r\ncontributors to poverty. In this regard, Government has\r\nbeen increasing the annual budget for education by 4 per\r\ncent in real terms, and this increase has had a significant\r\nimpact on the delivery of education and the attainment of\r\nan adult literacy rate of 70.5 per cent. Furthermore, the\r\nGovernment has recently announced its intention to\r\nintroduce free primary education beginning in the year\r\n2000.\r\nWhat we, however, find puzzling is the scepticism\r\nof some of our development partners regarding the\r\nsustainability of the programme. If its viability were a\r\ncause for concern, we would have expected expressions\r\nof support to ensure the success of such a worthy\r\ninitiative, which is in keeping with so many goals of\r\nglobal conferences for poverty eradication.\r\nThe rampant HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica is putting an unbearable strain on already fragile\r\nhealth systems, eroding the gains made in child survival\r\nand the achievement of better health. The combination of\r\nHIV/AIDS and malaria is closely associated with\r\nincreases in maternal mortality and the significant\r\nreduction in life expectancy in many African countries.\r\nWe commend the work of the United Nations system in\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nthis regard, and in particular the indication that the response\r\nof the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, in\r\npartnership with various bodies, including the private sector,\r\nis commensurate with the gravity of the situation. The\r\nassistance of the international community is required to\r\ncontinue these efforts.\r\nThe problem of external debt, which continues to be\r\na developmental problem for Africa, received considerable\r\nattention at the recent Cologne Summit of the G-8, and\r\npromising decisions were taken to relieve the debt of the\r\nhighly indebted poor countries. Lesotho appreciates the\r\nvarious initiatives to ameliorate the problem and in general\r\nsupports them, including the effort to find appropriate\r\nfinancing mechanisms for the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative. While Lesotho has successfully\r\nendeavoured to meet its international financial obligations\r\nand commitments, my Government is now faced with a\r\nheavy and unbearable burden of debt-servicing, which is\r\nconstraining our national development efforts. We therefore\r\ncall for a review of the Initiative, with a view to\r\nsubstantially relaxing the eligibility criteria so that debt-\r\nstressed countries like Lesotho may also benefit from it.\r\nThe recent sale of gold reserves by some countries has\r\nalready resulted in a substantial drop in the price of gold\r\nand the consequential closure of marginal gold mines in\r\nSouth Africa. The overall impact has been reduced\r\nemployment opportunities, not only in South Africa but also\r\nin neighbouring countries, such as Lesotho, which have\r\ntraditionally depended on employment in South African\r\ngold mines. Let us take care not to create an African\r\nemployment crisis so soon after the Asian financial crisis.\r\nIt is incumbent upon the international community to work\r\nwith affected countries to develop strategies for mitigating\r\nthe negative effects of whatever mechanisms are agreed for\r\nfinancing the HIPC Initiative.\r\nThe General Assembly decided at its fifty-second\r\nsession to hold an event in the year 2001 for the purpose of\r\naddressing, in a holistic manner, the question of financing\r\nfor development in both its national and international\r\naspects and in the context of globalization and\r\ninterdependence. We must face up to the fact that\r\ndevelopment is in crisis and that, unless we take bold\r\nmeasures to find resources for financing it, the future of\r\nmankind is bleak indeed. My delegation fully shares the\r\nview that through this process, which will also address\r\ndevelopment through the perspective of finance, the\r\ninternational community will be afforded a unique\r\nopportunity to start the new millennium with a momentous\r\npolitical gesture that demonstrates global solidarity for,\r\ninter alia, poverty eradication and the attainment of\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nIt is in the interest of all countries to pursue\r\ndevelopment cooperation on the basis of genuine\r\npartnership and mutually beneficial arrangements. We\r\nremain convinced that the contemporary realities of\r\nglobalization and liberalization make it clear that capital\r\nflows from developed countries not only benefit\r\ndeveloping countries, but also combine in a dynamic\r\nprocess with the resources of developing countries in a\r\nmanner that brings benefits to both developing and\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nWe also want to stress that every effort should be\r\nmade to narrow the gap between developing countries —\r\nin particular, the least developed countries, such as\r\nLesotho — and the developed countries. In this regard,\r\nwe await with anticipation the outcome of the review next\r\nyear of the Plan of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries.\r\nIt is worth repeating that when we adopted the\r\nProgramme of Action at the United Nations International\r\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo in\r\nSeptember 1994, we were committing ourselves to the\r\nsupport of strategies aimed at enhancing the quality of life\r\nfor families and individuals through recognition of their\r\nrights to quality services. The Conference was indeed a\r\nturning point that marked a departure from the notion of\r\npopulation control to a human-rights-based approach in\r\naddressing our demographic concerns.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nrededicate itself to the principles of democracy, good\r\ngovernance, observance of human rights and the rule of\r\nlaw as the only way in which all of us can ensure a\r\nprosperous and lasting future for all our peoples.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Lesotho for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nThe Right Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili,\r\nPrime Minister of Lesotho, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Salim El-Hoss, Prime Minister of\r\nLebanon\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Lebanon.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nMr. Salim El-Hoss, Prime Minister of Lebanon, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of Lebanon, His Excellency Mr. Salim\r\nEl-Hoss, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. El-Hoss (Lebanon) (interpretation from Arabic):\r\nIt is my pleasure, Mr. President, to congratulate you on\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fourth session. We are confident that your efforts and\r\nexpertise will ensure the success of this session.\r\nI should also like to thank your predecessor,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, for having successfully conducted the\r\nwork of the fifty-third session. Furthermore, I would be\r\nremiss if I failed to express our thanks and appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication\r\nto the pursuit of world peace and stability and for his\r\ncontinuous efforts to enhance the credibility of the\r\nOrganization through the settlement of disputes, old and\r\nnew.\r\nThis session is unique not only because it is the last\r\nGeneral Assembly session of the century that witnessed the\r\nbirth of the United Nations, but also because it coincides\r\nwith the emergence of serious trends that call for by-\r\npassing some of the basic principles on which the United\r\nNations was built. They advocate the establishment of a\r\nnew world order, one to whose requirements the United\r\nNations must conform rather than being part of the wider\r\nand more comprehensive United Nations framework.\r\nA case in point is the call to acknowledge the\r\nprinciple of relative sovereignty or the obligation to\r\ninterfere where necessary in the internal affairs of States, or\r\nto marginalize the role of the Security Council, which is the\r\nmain tool for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nSome States believe that the establishment of a new\r\nworld order is a result of decisive, historic developments in\r\nvision and concept. Others, however, feel that it is no more\r\nthan a mere desire on the part of some to impose ideas\r\ncommensurate with the drastic change that has taken place\r\nin the balance of power on the international scene. In our\r\nopinion, this issue requires further deliberations and\r\ndiscussions.\r\nThrough dialogue we, the peoples and countries of the\r\nworld, can arrive at a unanimous understanding of the\r\nquestions at hand, and in this way secure the necessary\r\nassurance in our pursuit of the common good and security\r\nof humanity. History has shown that no regime or system\r\ncan endure and prevail unless it is built on justice and\r\nequality. It cannot be selective, nor can it pursue a policy\r\nof double standards. It cannot assert its authority over\r\nsome and remain indifferent to injustices done to others.\r\nIt cannot give generously to some and persistently deprive\r\nothers. Any system that seeks to maintain international\r\npeace and security must depend on preventive diplomacy\r\nto preempt problems long before their onset and\r\nexacerbation.\r\nFurthermore, it should create an effective mechanism\r\nfor peacemaking, one that contributes seriously to\r\nbuilding and safeguarding peace. It is essential that we\r\ntackle the root causes of problems, not merely their\r\nviolent manifestations.\r\nWe must also persevere in our pursuit of world\r\neconomic and social justice. We should not be content\r\nwith defending stability from a restrictively political\r\nperspective.\r\nIn any event, no world order, whether old or new,\r\ncan condone, for example, the occupation of the lands of\r\nothers by force. It cannot allow acts of aggression to be\r\ncommitted against people and property, nor should it\r\nsubject civilians to various forms of arbitrary practices.\r\nIn March 1978, Israel undertook a unilateral act of\r\naggression against Lebanon. It occupied one tenth of\r\nLebanese territory. In the face of this aggression, the\r\nSecurity Council adopted resolution 425 (1978) and called\r\nupon Israel to withdraw its forces from all Lebanese\r\nterritories immediately and unconditionally.\r\nEven though more than 21 years have passed since\r\nthe adoption of that resolution by the Security Council, it\r\nhas not been enforced. Israel continues to occupy\r\ncherished parts of southern Lebanon and the Western\r\nBekaa valley. Throughout those years, Israel has\r\ncontinued its almost daily acts of aggression against\r\nLebanon and its people.\r\nIn 1982, Israel\u0027s hostility peaked when its forces\r\ninvaded Lebanese territory, reaching the capital, Beirut,\r\nafter a long siege. After a partial withdrawal from\r\nLebanon, Israel resorted to the current scorched-earth\r\npolicy. Throughout the month of July 1993, Israel\r\nbombed dozens of Lebanese villages and towns from\r\nland, air and sea positions. It inflicted heavy property\r\ndamage, killed and wounded more than 250 civilians and\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nforced more than 300,000 Lebanese out of their homes and\r\nvillages.\r\nIn April 1996, continuing its policy of comprehensive\r\ndestruction and bombardment, Israel intentionally massacred\r\n102 civilians in the village of Qana, using incendiary\r\nbombs. Most of our fallen martyrs were women, children\r\nand elderly men who sadly thought they could find a safe\r\nhaven in the premises of the United Nations forces in\r\nsouthern Lebanon, but alas, Israel did not hesitate to violate\r\nthe sanctity of those premises.\r\nSoon after, an understanding was reached for a\r\nceasefire and for protecting civilians. This became known\r\nlater as the April Understanding of 1996. A group was\r\nestablished to monitor the implementation of that\r\nagreement, with the membership of Lebanon, Syria and\r\nIsrael and under the co-chairmanship of France and the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\nAllow me, on this occasion, to express our\r\nappreciation to the group for the useful and restraining role\r\nit has played pending the realization of the full and\r\nunconditional Israeli withdrawal from the Lebanese\r\nterritories.\r\nUnfortunately, this has not prevented Israel from\r\nrepeatedly and seriously violating the terms of the April\r\nUnderstanding. Israel has lately launched yet another attack\r\nagainst Lebanese civilians and infrastructure. On 24 and 25\r\nJune 1999, Israeli warplanes destroyed two power plants\r\nand three bridges, causing a total blackout in Lebanon.\r\nCommunications were jeopardized, extensive property\r\ndamage was incurred and many people were killed. This\r\nIsraeli act of aggression has had direct and indirect negative\r\neffects on the social and economic life of Lebanon until\r\nthis very moment.\r\nIsrael persists in its oppressive arbitrary practices\r\nagainst civilians in the territories that are still under its\r\noccupation. Civilians are kidnapped, detained, tortured or\r\nkilled, displaced or expelled.\r\nWe in Lebanon are tirelessly working with the United\r\nNations and other humanitarian forums to put an end to\r\nthese acts and to prevent their recurrence, the most recent\r\nof which was the imposition of siege on the village of Aita\r\nal-Sha b and other villages in the south. Agricultural crops\r\nwere destroyed and many of the residents were kidnapped,\r\nexpelled or detained.\r\nOn 14 July 1999, Lebanon celebrated Lebanese\r\nprisoners\u0027 day. From this rostrum, we again call for the\r\nredoubling of efforts and for bringing more pressure to\r\nbear on Israel to release all the Lebanese detainees\r\nlanguishing in Israeli prisons as hostages.\r\nIsrael\u0027s Supreme Court has acknowledged and\r\ncondoned holding these prisoners. Some of these people\r\nare incarcerated in al-Khiyam detention camp inside\r\nLebanese occupied territories. There are many elderly and\r\nsick among them who are often denied visits and the\r\nhumanitarian care usually provided by the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross. This is a breach of the\r\nFourth Geneva Convention concerning the protection of\r\ncivilians in time of war.\r\nOn this occasion, Lebanon emphasizes once again its\r\nright to be compensated for the loss of life and for the\r\nproperty damage that has been inflicted upon it for many\r\nyears as a result of Israel\u0027s acts of aggression and\r\narbitrary practices against its civilians.\r\nLebanon recalls the need for the unconditional\r\nimplementation of resolution 425 (1978). Pending the\r\nenforcement of that resolution, it is only natural that the\r\nLebanese people stand united in resisting Israeli\r\noccupation. It is also just and natural that they uphold the\r\nlegitimacy of the Lebanese resistance, which is after all\r\nan embodiment of the faith in one\u0027s homeland and a\r\nhighly evolved form of struggle for freedom. Moreover,\r\nthe Lebanese resistance constitutes a consecration of the\r\nlegitimate right of self-defense included in the terms of\r\nreference of the April Understanding of 1996.\r\nIsrael repeatedly circumvents the mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). For\r\nour part, we highly value the positive and constructive\r\nrole that UNIFIL plays. On this occasion, we would like\r\nto express once again our appreciation and gratitude to\r\nthe Force for the noble sacrifices it has made in fulfilling\r\nits mandate under the most arduous circumstances.\r\nLebanon is certainly committed to the Middle East\r\npeace process. Lebanon stands ready, given the\r\ninseparability of the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, to\r\nresume the negotiations from the point where they left off\r\nin 1996 and in accordance with the terms of reference of\r\nthe 1991 Madrid Conference. Our ultimate objective is to\r\nreach a just, comprehensive and permanent peace in the\r\nMiddle East on the basis of the resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy. Lebanon reiterates here its\r\ncommitment to resolution 425 (1978), which does not call\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\non the parties concerned to negotiate but does\r\nunequivocally call upon Israel to withdraw immediately and\r\nunconditionally from all Lebanese territories.\r\nAt a time when serious prospects have appeared on the\r\nhorizon for the resumption of the peace negotiations, and\r\ndespite what might be said about the art of negotiation, the\r\nrecent declarations by senior Israeli officials do not auger\r\nwell for the peace process. Nor do they expressly indicate\r\nthe presence of presumably good intentions. They do not\r\nleave room for us to conclude that there is a genuine desire\r\non the part of the Israeli side to establish peace based on\r\njustice. All of this prompts us to view with caution the\r\nconditions set out for the resumption of the peace process\r\nat the present stage, to say the least.\r\nIsrael\u0027s intransigence becomes all the more apparent in\r\nthe light of the statements made by its Prime Minister\r\nBarak. In those statements, Mr. Barak stressed several no\u0027s,\r\nnamely, no to a return to the 1967 borders, no to the\r\npartition of Jerusalem, no to dismantling the settlements,\r\nand no to the return of Palestinian refugees. Mr. Barak\r\nrepeated his position when he declared at his recent meeting\r\nwith President Clinton that the Palestinian refugees shall not\r\nreturn to their homeland and that they should stay in the\r\ncountries where they presently reside. The natural\r\nprerequisites of peace cannot be reconciled with\r\nMr. Barak\u0027s no\u0027s. Those prerequisites are based on justice\r\nand have been endorsed by international legitimacy. They\r\nrequire the following elements.\r\nIsrael should withdraw unconditionally from Lebanon,\r\nin accordance with the provisions of Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978).\r\nAll of the Golan Heights should be returned to Syria,\r\nto the borders of 4 June 1967, as has already been\r\ndiscussed and agreed upon.\r\nThe Palestinian people should be able to regain their\r\ninalienable rights. Those rights include their right to self-\r\ndetermination, to the establishment of their State on their\r\nnational soil, with Jerusalem as its capital, and their right to\r\nreturn to the lands in Palestine from which they were\r\nuprooted.\r\nOn this occasion Lebanon would like to draw the\r\nattention of the international community to the fact that it\r\nis impossible for a peaceful settlement to be achieved and\r\nfor the long-awaited peace to endure and prevail unless the\r\nPalestinian refugees, particularly the hundreds of thousands\r\nwhom Lebanon has hosted on its soil, are allowed to return\r\nto their homeland. From this international rostrum,\r\nLebanon resonates its people\u0027s unanimous and\r\nunequivocal rejection of settling Palestinian refugees on\r\nits territories. This unanimity was consecrated in the\r\nLebanese Constitution, which is the cornerstone of the\r\nnational covenant. We see it as necessary to draw\r\nattention to the danger of approaching this question from\r\na merely economic and social perspective while ignoring\r\nits political dimension. That political dimension is, in\r\nessence, the core of the injustice that befell the\r\nPalestinians who were displaced from their homeland.\r\nThis unanimous position is shared by both the Lebanese\r\nand the Palestinians in Lebanon.\r\nLebanon therefore renews its call for the\r\ninternational community to shoulder its responsibility in\r\nfull. It must come up with a just and equitable settlement\r\nthat addresses the issue of the final status of the\r\nPalestinian refugees, in accordance with the\r\ninternationally agreed principles that govern similar\r\nsituations. Those principles, it should be recalled, were\r\nrecently applied in Kosovo. Settling Palestinian refugees\r\nin Lebanon, which is equally rejected by the Palestinians\r\nand the Lebanese, would create, if carried out, a potential\r\nhotbed of tension that would jeopardize the security of the\r\nMiddle East region and its stability as well.\r\nWe view positively the opportunity for progress in\r\nthe peace process. The recent visit by United States\r\nSecretary of State Madame Madeleine Albright to some\r\ncountries in the region was an acknowledgment of the\r\nresponsibilities of her country and the influence that that\r\nvisit can bring to bear on the parties to the conflict. For\r\nour part, we are keen on the role that the United States\r\nand the Russian Federation can play in the pursuit of a\r\njust and comprehensive peace. We believe that they can\r\nboth provide the necessary guarantees for the successful\r\nimplementation of the prospective agreement.\r\nWe equally count on an active European role in both\r\nthe political process and the development of the region as\r\nwell. This applies to the negotiations for the settlement of\r\nthe conflict and to the subsequent stage. We particularly\r\napplaud the supportive role of France, on which we can\r\nalways rely.\r\nWe would like on this occasion to thank the\r\nPresidency of the European Union, currently held by\r\nFinland. Our thanks go in particular to Ms. Tarja\r\nHalonen, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland, who\r\nrecently visited Lebanon as part of her visit to the region.\r\nMs. Halonen expressed the European Union\u0027s readiness to\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\ncontribute to the search for a just, peaceful and\r\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East question.\r\nLebanon was among the first countries to condemn the\r\nIraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. It supported all\r\nthe Security Council resolutions adopted in this regard. We\r\nexpress our solidarity with sisterly Kuwait on the question\r\nof the release of Kuwaiti detainees and prisoners of war.\r\nWe also support Kuwait\u0027s claim of sovereignty over all of\r\nits territories and resources. Releasing the Kuwaiti prisoners\r\ncan contribute to the improvement of inter-Arab relations.\r\nAt the same time, Lebanon hopes that the embargo imposed\r\non the brotherly people of Iraq be lifted. They, too, are\r\nentitled to live in dignity and to enjoy prosperity and\r\nsecurity.\r\nLebanon attaches special importance to the question of\r\nconsolidating the security and stability of the Arab Gulf\r\nregion. We applaud the efforts made by Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil to eliminate the causes of tension and to settle\r\nexisting disputes by peaceful means in the context of good\r\nfaith and good neighbourly relations. Those efforts were\r\nundertaken to settle, among other things, the dispute\r\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran over three islands.\r\nThe United Nations is the sum total of the collective\r\nwill of its Member States. It has been unable to discharge\r\nall of its obligations in the context of the settlement of\r\nprotracted and new disputes. It has also been unable to\r\nrestore peace to many of the tension-ridden regions of the\r\nworld. It is appropriate to proceed with the reform\r\nprogramme envisaged for the international Organization, as\r\noutlined by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 1997. This\r\nwill enable the United Nations to respond to the accelerated\r\npace of international relations in the political, economic and\r\nsocial fields.\r\nBut despite all the risks and pitfalls, our international\r\nOrganization is still a unique international authority. It is\r\nthe proper forum in which to engage in a balanced and\r\nobjective discussion that will lead to at least some\r\nnecessary solutions. It is heartening indeed to recall that the\r\nOrganization has had some outstanding and promising\r\nachievements in several fields of human endeavour. These\r\ninclude achievements in the fields of human rights, the\r\nrights of the child and women\u0027s rights, as well as\r\nenvironment and development. They also include the\r\nprogressive development of international law and the\r\nenriching of the body of international law by the\r\nestablishment of new institutions such as the International\r\nCriminal Court.\r\nIt is pertinent to mention in this respect that Lebanon\r\nhas a time-honoured culture that is deeply rooted in\r\nhistory. Our country has been an integral part of the\r\ninternational scene, acting and reacting to it positively,\r\nsince it joined the Organization as a founding Member.\r\nBecause of its openness and intellectual wealth, it has\r\nalways taken the lead in responding to the requirements\r\nof progress at various levels.\r\nLebanon is seeking to join the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO). It has been working steadily to\r\ndevelop its economy and rationalize its financial policies.\r\nBy so doing, it will be able to bring these policies in line\r\nwith the standards and regulations drawn up by WTO.\r\nThis will ultimately pave the way for a world economic\r\npartnership in trade and development on the basis of\r\nmutual benefit and equality among States.\r\nLebanon attaches great importance to environmental\r\nissues and has created a ministry for this specific purpose.\r\nLebanon joins in the international efforts currently under\r\nway to resolve these problems. It calls upon powerful\r\nStates to honour the commitments they entered into under\r\nthe international conventions concluded for this purpose.\r\nLebanon also believes that the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization has become a reality that is imbued with\r\nboth positive and negative elements, which in turn\r\ninfluence the cultures and economies of Member States.\r\nIn our opinion, the United Nations is the proper forum to\r\naddress and check the repercussions of this phenomenon.\r\nIt is in fact the mature offspring of the 1940s version of\r\nglobalization.\r\nLebanon has always been firm in its commitment to\r\nthe principles of democracy and freedom and faithful to\r\nits obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. It\r\nhas always honoured the decisions and resolutions of the\r\ninternational Organization and its various bodies and\r\nconferences. We have built in our capital, Beirut, a\r\nbeautiful headquarters building for its subsidiary bodies.\r\nWe believe in its mission and are committed to its\r\npurposes.\r\nLebanon is currently devoting every effort to\r\ncomplete the process of reconstruction and to consolidate\r\nand rationalize its institutions. We are steadily working on\r\nestablishing the rule of law. Our unique experience with\r\ncoexistence, built on moderation, tolerance and unity in a\r\nsound national environment, is an example to be\r\nfollowed. Lebanon is determined to regain the\r\ndistinguished position it once held in the region and the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nworld. It will remain true to its Arab identity, with all the\r\nconsequences and dimensions that this entails.\r\nLebanon is a small country on the east coast of the\r\nMediterranean. For 5,000 years, it has hosted successive\r\ncivilizations. Lebanon influenced these civilizations and was\r\ninfluenced by them. We shall take the lead in giving, once\r\nwe have recovered our national soil thanks to the struggle\r\nof our sons and with the effective support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Lebanon for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Salim El-Hoss, Prime Minister of Lebanon, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and External\r\nTrade of Luxembourg, Mrs. Lydie Polfer.\r\nMrs. Polfer (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): I should\r\nlike at the outset, Sir, warmly to congratulate you on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly, which\r\nmarks the opening of the regular annual session. Your wise\r\nand dynamic leadership will determine the scope and\r\noutcome of our work.\r\nI would like also to thank Mr. Didier Opertti for his\r\ndedication and commitment throughout the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nLet me also reiterate Luxembourg\u0027s confidence, given\r\nour Secretary-General\u0027s characteristic tireless determination\r\nto promote dialogue, knowledge and mutual recognition,\r\nthat his efforts will lead to greater mutual understanding.\r\nThe respect accorded to, and the effectiveness of, our\r\nOrganization will depend on the strong cohesiveness of its\r\nmembership. Within its modest means, my country intends\r\nto contribute to this key objective. Luxembourg is proud of\r\nhaving participated in the definition of the European\r\nUnion\u0027s core positions. These were explained to the\r\nAssembly by Mrs. Tarja Halonen, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Finland, in the statement she made in her\r\ncapacity as current Chairman-in-Office of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nThis fall will mark the tenth anniversary of the end of\r\nthe cold war, which for more than four decades hampered\r\nthe harmonious development of international relations.\r\nAmong other things, it prevented our Organization from\r\nfully discharging its mandate to maintain international\r\npeace and cooperation. This anniversary is definitely a\r\nhappy one, even if much of what had been hoped for in\r\n1989 has failed to materialize and the consequences of\r\ncertain upheavals are still being felt.\r\nNonetheless, today\u0027s international environment has\r\nseen far-reaching changes, and the international\r\ncommunity is now in a position to tackle very complex\r\nchallenges. My country hopes that this historic\r\nbreakthrough at century\u0027s end will be further consolidated.\r\nToday is my first opportunity to represent my\r\ncountry from this rostrum and to address the Assembly,\r\nwhich comprises nearly all the countries of the world.\r\nLuxembourg is one of the founding Members of our\r\nOrganization, and in October 1945, it was the smallest.\r\nOur presence in San Francisco was due to our\r\ndetermination to cooperate with the international\r\ncommunity and to reaffirm our sovereignty. Today I\r\nwould reiterate the commitment of the people of\r\nLuxembourg to our Organization, which is called upon to\r\nplay a pivotal role in an international environment that is\r\nbecoming increasingly globalized yet, at the same time,\r\nmore and more fragmented.\r\nWhile the first aspect of this process, globalization,\r\nis most apparent in the economic field, the second,\r\nfragmentation, is more clearly felt in the political arena,\r\nas social inequities are increasing. This process will\r\nundoubtedly result in very complex tensions, heightening\r\nthose that already exist and creating new ones. These will\r\nhave to be analyzed and dealt with; to do this we will\r\nneed imagination, clear-sightedness and, above all, an\r\neffective resolve and capacity to act. Our security and\r\nprosperity will depend on the way in which our\r\nOrganization confronts these challenges.\r\nIt would be unrealistic to expect a solution from the\r\nOrganization every time humanitarian disaster strikes or\r\na conflict breaks out. There is no such thing as a world\r\ngovernment, and it would be a disservice to the United\r\nNations to fail to acknowledge this obvious fact.\r\nNevertheless, the United Nations is a platform and\r\na forum for negotiations at the global level, and we\r\nshould therefore exert every effort to ensure its smooth\r\nfunctioning. To do this it must have adequate funding to\r\nduty bound to respect their Charter obligation to pay in\r\nfull, unconditionally and on time the amounts they owe to\r\nthe Organization. This also means that increasingly, the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nmajor political orientations of the Organization are decided\r\nupon by consensus, thereby ensuring the support of all\r\nStates for its actions. It also means that the effort to update\r\nand reform the United Nations mechanisms still remains\r\nfully relevant.\r\nIt is only through cooperation, understanding and\r\nsolidarity, together with respect for commitments entered\r\ninto and for the rule of law, that progress towards a true\r\ncohesiveness will be possible. All the Members of our\r\nOrganization are directly responsible for ensuring that their\r\ncontribution to the common undertaking and to its progress\r\nis not lacking. This was the case during the decision to\r\ncreate an International Criminal Court. We have thus\r\nreached an important stage in the field of international\r\nethics and morality by providing ourselves with an\r\ninstrument through which those responsible for atrocities in\r\ntime of war and for crimes against humanity will be held\r\nto account. The international community will henceforth be\r\nmore vigilant and will no longer allow those who have been\r\nfound guilty of such crimes to continue to enjoy impunity.\r\nMy country will ratify the Statute of the Court as soon as\r\npossible, and we hope that it will soon become a reality.\r\nMy country\u0027s profound commitment to the European\r\nUnion, which is preparing to enlarge its membership, is a\r\nsure reflection of our strong aspiration to strengthen both\r\nthe internal cohesion of the countries of the region and to\r\npromote cooperation at an international level. The\r\ncontribution of the European Union to the life of our\r\nOrganization is intended to be a driving force for its further\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSmall countries like mine tend to develop an acute\r\nawareness of their own vulnerability. This is often further\r\naggravated by a considerable difficulty: that of making\r\nknown to our foreign partners a little-known national\r\nreality. That explains our commitment to the vitality and\r\nsmooth functioning of intergovernmental organizations. For\r\nus, the United Nations represents an irreplaceable forum for\r\nthe exchange of ideas and experiences, but to an even\r\ngreater extent it must be a tool for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, development and respect\r\nfor universal values.\r\nA new Government has just taken office in\r\nLuxembourg. Its first task will be to ensure the continuity\r\nof our foreign commitments. But it also intends consistently\r\nto develop our policy of demonstrating our presence,\r\nparticipation and solidarity at the international level. This\r\ndetermination will be expressed through the major\r\nintergovernmental organizations, which define the rules of\r\ncoexistence between nations and peoples. The United\r\nNations unquestionably takes pride of place among them.\r\nMy Government also intends to further develop its\r\nrelations with the more remote regions of the world. This\r\nis an effort to respond to a real deficiency, which can be\r\nexplained by our size and our limited human resources. It\r\nis important for us to remedy that situation through a\r\nbalanced programme of contacts. The United Nations, and\r\nthe presence of numerous delegations at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters in New York and at Geneva, will doubtless\r\nprovide us opportunities conducive to achieving that end.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme\r\nHuman Development Report this year undertakes an in-\r\ndepth analysis of the phenomenon of globalization. It\r\nclearly brings out the beneficial aspects and the\r\nopportunities provided by this process, while at the same\r\ntime showing the negative consequences, which are very\r\nserious and worrying: instability in financial relations,\r\nhigh unemployment, an unsteady job market, the ravages\r\nof AIDS, the increasing inequalities between North and\r\nSouth, the extension of those inequalities to the field of\r\nknowledge and the constantly growing marginalization of\r\na large number of developing countries.\r\nThe political and social effects of these\r\ndevelopments are no less worrying: increased\r\nimpoverishment, new forms of crime and violence,\r\nincreased migration, the destabilization of States and the\r\ngrowing number of conflicts. Faced with these issues, the\r\nStates Members of this Organization have a major\r\nresponsibility to assume. The proposals contained in the\r\nreport therefore deserve constructive examination, and my\r\ndelegation is ready to take part in it. Ensuring that there\r\nis a social and ethical dimension to globalization, agreeing\r\non new rules for good world governance and protecting\r\nthe environment are some of the major issues to be\r\nagreed on in forthcoming discussions. That is why we\r\nintend to deepen our commitment in areas related to\r\nhuman development.\r\nThe fight against poverty, which the United Nations\r\nhas declared to be a priority objective, cannot be\r\nconducted only in the economic sphere. It should be part\r\nof an overall plan that also deals with related factors such\r\nas the lack of family care facilities, shortcomings in\r\neducation and health and insufficient administrative\r\nstructures. A reallocation of resources is also required as\r\npart of this effort. In that spirit, Luxembourg is now in\r\nthe process of meeting the targets of our Organization.\r\nStarting in the year 2000, it will be devoting 0.7 per cent\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nof its gross national product to official development\r\nassistance. The Government of Luxembourg has decided to\r\nincrease that contribution to 1 per cent of its gross national\r\nproduct over the next five years. Education and health will\r\nbe priority areas for our cooperation.\r\nDuring the negotiations in the Millennium Round in\r\nthe World Trade Organization we must take account of that\r\ncontext and pay particular attention to the interests of the\r\ndeveloping countries. We also support all the efforts\r\ndesigned to alleviate the debt problem, particularly in the\r\ncase of the least developed countries.\r\nThe vast majority of the people of Luxembourg uphold\r\na model of society that strikes a fair balance between free\r\nenterprise and social justice. This model of a social market\r\neconomy ensures development and social cohesion, even if\r\nit may require periodic adjustment. This should prove an\r\ninspiration at the regional and international levels.\r\nThrough the experience that we have gained over one\r\nand a half centuries of independence, Luxembourg is\r\nconvinced that the principles of democracy, respect for\r\nhuman rights, the functioning of the rule of law and the\r\ntransparent and ordered management of public affairs are\r\nthe essential elements that help to promote development.\r\nThe major conferences that have taken place during the past\r\ndecade on the subjects of human rights, social development,\r\npopulation, the advancement of women and human\r\nsettlements have opened a new era of constructive dialogue\r\nand shared responsibility, which has made a major\r\ncontribution to defining and redefining the action of the\r\nUnited Nations in the field of development. We must\r\nensure that henceforth there will be coordinated, integrated\r\nand effective follow-up to the steps that have been taken.\r\nThose who represent civil society, the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, are essential partners of our\r\nGovernments in the implementation of the programmes and\r\naction plans developed and adopted during the major\r\nconferences. It is those people who work in the field in\r\ndirect contact with women, men and children who are at the\r\nvery centre or our efforts. We therefore attach great\r\nimportance to their close association with the follow-up\r\nprocess for the conferences and the preparations for future\r\nactivities.\r\nOther meetings are in preparation, notably those on the\r\nsubjects of racism and development financing. Each of\r\nthese initiatives is part of our effort to promote a fairer and\r\nmore equitable society, both internationally and within our\r\nown national societies. The United Nations serves as a\r\ncatalyst in this process. It is undeniable that in this field\r\nour Organization has found an innovative and useful role\r\nto play.\r\nIt is indeed paradoxical that a decade that was\r\noriginally marked by a desire for openness has ended with\r\na disturbing new outbreak of bloody conflicts and\r\npractices that we thought had become things of the past.\r\nHow can we overlook the growing number of\r\nhumanitarian tragedies and fail to see the increasing\r\nexpressions of nationalism, intolerance and refusal to\r\naccept those who are different? They highlight the\r\nhistorical or newly erected barriers which have made\r\nimpractical any dialogue between majorities and\r\nminorities.\r\nIn these circumstances, there is a new requirement.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has said, strict adherence to the\r\ntraditional concept of State sovereignty is no longer\r\nsufficient to meet present-day realities. We must\r\ninvestigate new ways to live together in society that will\r\nrespect the character of each individual. We must find\r\nways to improve the functioning of democracy so that it\r\nwill be better able to accommodate internal diversity.\r\nThis Organization, especially the organ responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nhas not been given sufficient means to adapt to new\r\nsituations. The structures of the Security Council are\r\ninadequate after several decades during which it has been\r\nimpossible to carry out a thorough review. Although\r\ndiscussions on Council reform have been under way for\r\nmore than five years, there is a prevailing feeling of\r\npowerlessness. It seems unlikely that any new movement\r\ncan result from the repeated clash of known positions.\r\nSince last autumn, Security Council action has been\r\nhamstrung by the reemergence of schisms harking back\r\nto a bygone age. Now as then, the result is an inability to\r\nact, so the matter of Iraq has been bogged down. For\r\nmore than a year, Council members have been unable to\r\nwork together and formulate a viable monitoring system\r\nthat would guarantee that the Iraqi regime no longer\r\npossesses weapons of mass destruction. This dispute\r\nbenefits only those who continue to flout international\r\nlaw. The credibility of the United Nations can hardly gain\r\nfrom this prevarication.\r\nThe recent political and humanitarian crisis in\r\nKosovo has shown that the community of nations no\r\nlonger has either sufficient determination or sufficient\r\nmeans to prevent tragedies of that scale. In the face of the\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nhorror of ethnic cleansing, a number of countries were\r\nobliged to shoulder their responsibilities. The tragic\r\ndeterioration of the situation on the ground and the lack of\r\nrealism at the negotiating table made military action\r\ninevitable. My country demonstrated its active solidarity\r\nduring that tragedy, because a passive response to such\r\ncrimes is no more acceptable in the international arena than\r\nit is at home. Today, pacification is under way in Kosovo,\r\nbut minorities must be protected, respect for the law must\r\nbe guaranteed, and democratic institutions must be set up.\r\nThe Organization, in collaboration with other institutions,\r\nhas taken these tasks in hand.\r\nThe international community\u0027s commitment to build\r\nmulti-ethnic, multicultural, democratic societies in the\r\nBalkans holds out to the Serbian leadership and the Serbian\r\npopulation the prospect of a peaceful, secure and\r\nprosperous future in the community of Europe. It is up to\r\nthem to seize this opportunity.\r\nThe Secretary-General has said that United Nations\r\naction cannot stop until stability, security and peace return\r\nto the entire African continent. That goal is far from having\r\nbeen achieved, with serious conflicts taking place in central\r\nAfrica and in Angola. But there are glimmers of light in\r\nSierra Leone, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nin the Horn of Africa. The crises there, while not yet\r\nresolved, are at least on the path of negotiation. It is\r\nencouraging to note that this progress has been achieved\r\nthanks to the active participation of the countries of the\r\nregion.\r\nWe cannot allow the fate of Africa to slip out of the\r\nfield of action of the international community. We must\r\ncontrol the diverse situations relating to politics,\r\ndevelopment and the democratization of society to enable\r\nthe continent to recover its proper place in the comity of\r\nnations. That can be achieved only through sustained,\r\nconcerted medium-term and long-term action by the\r\ninternational community and by the United Nations system.\r\nMy country will participate fully in these efforts.\r\nIn East Timor it seemed that, after 25 years of\r\ninjustice and oppression, there was a process that would\r\ngive the Timorese people an opportunity peacefully to take\r\ncharge of their future. Their desire for independence was\r\nfreely and clearly expressed under United Nations auspices.\r\nDespite the Indonesian authorities having committed\r\nthemselves to guaranteeing order and security before and\r\nafter the popular consultation, grave violations occurred in\r\nEast Timor, followed by massacres and the large-scale\r\ndeportation of civilians. We welcome the dispatch of a\r\nmultinational force under United Nations authority to put\r\na rapid end to the violence and the atrocities, and to\r\nrepatriate people in decent conditions. We support the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and of the United Nations\r\nMission in East Timor to continue the process leading to\r\nthe independence of East Timor. We must quickly\r\nimprove the island\u0027s humanitarian situation, which\r\ncontinues to deteriorate, inflicting suffering on the\r\npopulation concerned.\r\nIn the Middle East, after years of deadlock, Israelis\r\nand Palestinians have resumed negotiations with the\r\nparticipation of other parties to the peace process, with\r\nthe declared intention of concluding them by the autumn\r\nof 2000, which would coincide with the Millennium\r\nAssembly. Could anyone imagine a finer symbol of\r\nconcerted international action to restore peace and\r\nsecurity than lasting reconciliation in a land that is the\r\ncradle of so many religions and so many civilizations?\r\nThe Millennium Summit will give us the chance to\r\ntake stock of what has been accomplished and of what the\r\ncomplex decade of the 1990s has brought us, as well as\r\nto chart the course for future action. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has outlined this in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. We must give him effective tools to\r\nforestall catastrophes, whether caused by the elements or\r\nby the hand of man, and to coordinate our work to\r\nminimize the consequences of tragedies we are unable to\r\navert.\r\nIn declaring its determination to tackle humanitarian\r\nchallenges in a spirit of prevention rather than of reaction,\r\nthe Organization has set itself an ambitious goal. It is up\r\nto us to prove our will and our capacity to work\r\neffectively to reach that goal.\r\nThe President: I call next on the Minister of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Kuwait, His Excellency\r\nMr. Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.\r\nMr. Al-Shaheen (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): It\r\ngives me pleasure, Sir, to extend to you on behalf of the\r\nState of Kuwait our warm congratulations on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfourth session. Given your extensive experience in\r\ninternational affairs and your personal skills and ability,\r\nwe are confident that you will be able to guide the\r\ndeliberations of the Assembly effectively. Let me assure\r\nYour Excellency that our delegation will cooperate with\r\nyou in a diligent and constructive spirit in order to reach\r\nour common goals.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nI wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti, who demonstrated good\r\nstewardship in his efforts to enhance the role of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to express once again our\r\ndeep gratitude to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless endeavours to reform the\r\nstructure and streamline the functioning of the Organization\r\nwith a view to bringing it more in line with the ever-\r\nchanging realities of modern times.\r\nKuwait welcomes the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to\r\nmembership in the United Nations. Our wish is that these\r\nnew Member States will enhance the role and effectiveness\r\nof our Organization in the fulfilment of the objectives and\r\npurposes of the Charter.\r\nThe wheel of time is now bringing us closer to the end\r\nof the twentieth century and entry into the third millennium.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of this truly historic benchmark, we\r\nthink that the world community should renew its resolve to\r\nachieve higher standards of living and political stability and\r\nsecurity, all of which are essential factors for progress.\r\nWith a deeper and greater sense of resolve, humankind\u0027s\r\nfuture can be better than our present.\r\nTragically, the twentieth century has seen two bitter\r\nworld wars, in addition to numerous bilateral, regional and\r\ncivil conflicts that claimed the lives of millions and millions\r\nof innocent human beings. Those innumerable wars put too\r\nmany spikes in the wheels of growth and progress of many\r\ndeveloping nations.\r\nOur cherished hopes and aspirations were always\r\ndirected towards fulfilling the long-standing human dream\r\nof using the immense scientific and technological\r\ndiscoveries and know-how acquired especially in the past\r\nfew decades of the twentieth century to address or solve the\r\nmajor and pressing global problems and phenomena facing\r\nthe human race. However, about one fifth of the human\r\nrace suffers from hunger; hundreds of millions of people\r\nlive below the poverty line; the arms race, for reasons of\r\nsecurity or territorial expansion, consumes enormous\r\nproportions of national budgets or assets to the detriment of\r\neconomic and development programmes; massacres driven\r\nby ethnic or political motives have become excuses for\r\nliquidating opposition forces and consolidating political\r\ndictatorships; human rights violations persist under different\r\njustifications; and the phenomenon of terrorism, which is\r\nbecoming increasingly intertwined with drug abuse and\r\nillicit trafficking in drugs, imperils the stability of\r\nsocieties and States, with the potential risks of\r\njeopardizing security and stability far beyond national\r\nborders. In our view, the international community must\r\ncope with these devastating dangers in a more serious\r\nfashion in order to rid the world of their evil.\r\nAlso, the millennium has seen many devastating\r\nnatural disasters that resulted in vast human losses and\r\nextensive property damage. The most recent tragic\r\nexample is the earthquake that struck the friendly Turkish\r\nRepublic in August. We are confident that Turkey will\r\neventually overcome the dire consequences of that\r\nnational catastrophe. Along with many other countries and\r\ninternational relief and aid organizations, Kuwait hastily\r\nresponded by airlifting basic human relief assistance and\r\nsupplies. Our response emanated from humanitarian\r\nmotives and our sense of good neighbourliness. In this\r\nregard, I wish to recall the decision by the States of the\r\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to donate $400 million\r\nto alleviate the impact of that severe quake.\r\nIn the same vein, we wish to extend our warm\r\ncondolences and sympathy to the friendly Government\r\nand people of Greece and to the families of victims of the\r\ntremor that hit there earlier this month. In order to draw\r\nsome lessons from the recurrence of such disasters,\r\nKuwait calls for expanding and reinforcing the role and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations disaster relief organs.\r\nSuch a role would help coordinate the contributions of the\r\nvarious States in order to fulfil their desired and optimal\r\ngoals, to the best of their capabilities.\r\nMy delegation now strongly feels that the\r\ninternational community should not underestimate the role\r\nand achievements of the United Nations system. Its\r\noutstanding track record over the past five decades\r\nshould, in our view, deepen our appreciation for the\r\nvaluable and credible manner in which the United Nations\r\nsystem addressed and resolved many conflicts and\r\nproblems across the globe. Indeed, the Untied Nations\r\nsaved mankind many potential tragedies. Hence, one\r\ncannot really imagine our contemporary world without\r\nthis Organization, to which Kuwait is honoured to belong.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of the legacy inherited by the\r\npresent generation and the possible challenges that will\r\nface us in the future, preparations are under way to\r\nconvene the Millennium Assembly session here in New\r\nYork in September next year. Given its historical context\r\nand the level of global participation, we hope that the\r\nsession will prove to be a true benchmark in the history\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nof humanity. Kuwait feels that such an historic occasion\r\nrequires proper and adequate preparation to ensure a truly\r\nmeaningful outcome in terms of sketching the future path\r\nof the Organization in the new century.\r\nThe issues on the global agenda are all serious and\r\npressing, and some new vision is needed to deal with them.\r\nIn any case, we are convinced that international cooperation\r\nand coordination and consolidation of human efforts will\r\nremain crucial to any viable endeavours to address those\r\nobstinate and interlinked problems within the framework of\r\nthe United Nations. Therefore, continued support to ensure\r\nreinvigoration of the United Nations remains in order.\r\nAs we look forward to the millennial summit as an\r\nunprecedented event, we think that the forthcoming historic\r\noccasion should not be a replay of the United Nations\r\nfiftieth anniversary celebrations, which were a largely\r\nceremonial and symbolic event. The gathering of world\r\nleaders should go beyond the usual ritual of delivering\r\nspeeches and photo sessions. Rather, our objective should\r\nbe charting out a meaningful path for the future in a\r\npragmatic, action-oriented fashion. The new vision should\r\nfocus on business-like treatment of universal issues such as\r\njustice for all, equality, harmonious co-existence,\r\ncooperation, inter-cultural dialogues and promotion of\r\nrespect for human rights, and advancing economic and\r\nsocial development to the top of our global agenda.\r\nAt this juncture, allow me to highlight the fact that the\r\nState of Kuwait has been ranked number one in the Arab\r\nworld and number thirty-five in the world in the United\r\nNations Development Programme(UNDP) Human\r\nDevelopment Report of 1999. Kuwait will, God willing,\r\ncontinue its steady efforts towards the improvement of the\r\neconomic and social conditions across the country, guided\r\nby, among other factors, the Human Development indices.\r\nIn the same vein, I wish to recall the recent initiative by\r\nHis Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait, who\r\nproclaimed a decree granting the women of Kuwait full\r\npolitical rights to participate in parliamentary elections and\r\nto run as candidates for the national assembly. This\r\ninitiative is yet another example of the keen interest on the\r\npart of His Highness the Amir to consolidate the\r\ndemocratic system in Kuwaiti society and to expand public\r\nparticipation in civil life. Indeed, it is a testimony to and\r\nrecognition of the prominent role and the valuable\r\ncontributions by Kuwaiti women to our society.\r\nAnother important goal we hope the Millennium\r\nAssembly will achieve is the expansion of the membership\r\nof the Security Council and the display of more\r\ntransparency in the Council\u0027s procedures and methods of\r\nwork. The question of reform of the Security Council has\r\nbeen exhaustively discussed over the past six years. Time\r\nhas indeed come for proper action with a view to\r\nallowing all United Nations Member States to participate\r\nin the decision-making process in a more representative\r\nand equitable manner, under controls that would ensure a\r\nbalance between effectiveness and larger membership.\r\nThe reform should also ensure the special responsibility\r\nand ability of the Council members to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nFollowing the end of the cold war, the world has\r\nwitnessed many challenges that threatened international\r\npeace and security in various regions. As a result of the\r\ngeneral ease in international relations and the growing\r\nrapprochement between East and West and the mounting\r\ndesire for global cooperation and coordination, the Untied\r\nNations system, through the Security Council, the primary\r\norgan responsible for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, sought to address and manage those\r\ncrises according to the ways and means that were set\r\nforth in the Charter. Yes, the United Nations has achieved\r\nsubstantial progress, though in varying degrees, and\r\nsometimes at a very heavy price in terms of losing\r\ndedicated personnel and peacekeepers on behalf of the\r\ncause of peace and in the service of humanity. Even when\r\nthe United Nations might appear to be faltering in\r\nperforming its mission, sometimes perhaps in a rather\r\nembarrassing way, the theoretical question that always\r\narises in our minds is: would that situation have been\r\nbetter had the United Nations not intervened? And the\r\nresultant answer that we arrive at is invariably: absolutely\r\nnot. Lapses, setbacks and failures are all, unfortunately,\r\nan inevitable tax that has to be paid in our pursuit of\r\nexcellence and progress, good intentions notwithstanding.\r\nThe sanctions system, under Article 41, Chapter VII,\r\nof the Charter, is one of the tools and methods that the\r\nSecurity Council found itself impelled to resort to in\r\ndealing with a number of States. The objective was to\r\nmake them change their behaviour and dissuade them\r\nfrom the pursuit of policies of aggression, which run\r\ncounter to the fundamental norms and principles of\r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nExperience on the ground has proved this method to be\r\neffective. On two occasions the Council suspended the\r\nsanctions imposed against some States once they had\r\ncomplied fully with their obligations under the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. This proves in no uncertain\r\nterms that the sanctions were not an end in themselves,\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nbut a means used to impose respect for the Charter and the\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nActing within the terms of its responsibilities, the\r\nSecurity Council established at the end of last January three\r\nseparate panels to evaluate the extent of Iraq\u0027s compliance\r\nwith its obligations under Security Council resolutions\r\nrelating to Iraq\u0027s invasion of the State of Kuwait. The\r\nSecretary-General himself participated in the selection of\r\nthe members of those panels, eminent, internationally\r\nknown persons who were efficient and neutral experts. The\r\npanels met for a period of two months. They also sought\r\nthe expert advice of many specialists and heard the views\r\nand presentations of many witnesses. Following extensive\r\nmeetings and intense deliberations, the panellists reached a\r\nset of conclusions and recommendations that I shall briefly\r\nsummarize as follows.\r\nFirst, the panel concerned with disarmament concluded\r\nthat there were still a number of important and serious\r\nmatters that had not yet been resolved. It emphasized the\r\nneed for the return of the inspection teams to Iraq as soon\r\nas possible under an integrated and reinforced monitoring\r\nand verification system based on relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the humanitarian situation the\r\npanel submitted several constructive proposals and\r\nrecommendations which, if implemented, would improve\r\nthe humanitarian conditions in Iraq. Perhaps the most\r\nimportant recommendation was the call to improve the\r\noperational mechanisms of the oil-for-food programme.\r\nAlso, the panel invited the Government of Iraq to ensure\r\nequitable distribution of humanitarian goods and to pay due\r\nattention to meeting the needs of the vulnerable groups of\r\nthe Iraqi population.\r\nThirdly, the panel concerned with Kuwaiti and third-\r\ncountry prisoners of war and the return of stolen property\r\nto Kuwait, the panel thought that in regard to the prisoners\r\nof war issue, cooperation by Iraq with the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Tripartite\r\nCommission had so far been below expectations. The panel\r\nwas not satisfied with the Iraqi explanations of why Iraq\r\nhad failed to provide information on the files submitted to\r\nit by the ICRC. The panel urged the Government of Iraq to\r\nreconsider its decision not to participate in the Tripartite\r\nCommission and its technical subcommittee. With regard to\r\nthe return of Kuwaiti property, the panel concluded that\r\nIraq had not fully complied with paragraph 2 of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 686 (1991), which demands that Iraq\r\nreturn all stolen property to Kuwait.\r\nAlthough those panels were established by the\r\nSecurity Council mainly to explore the possibility of\r\nmitigating the impact of the sanctions regime and\r\nimproving the humanitarian conditions in Iraq, it is deeply\r\nregrettable that Iraq itself has declined to participate in\r\ntheir work. Iraq has also rejected the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations reached by these panels. In this context,\r\nthe Secretary-General, in paragraph 81 of his report\r\n(A/54/1) on the work of the Organization submitted to the\r\ncurrent session of the Assembly, referred to Iraq\u0027s failure\r\nto fulfil its obligations and set the humanitarian\r\nrequirements that Iraq must meet. The Secretary-General\r\nstates:\r\n“Relations with Iraq took a turn for the worse during\r\nthe year, despite a brief period of compliance with\r\nthe Memorandum of Understanding signed by\r\nDeputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and myself in\r\nFebruary 1998. In the face of continuing Iraqi non-\r\ncompliance, the use of force by two Member States\r\nand the division in the Security Council that\r\nfollowed it was predictable. Our principal demands\r\nremain unchanged, however: Iraq must fully comply\r\nwith all relevant Security Council resolutions; the\r\ninternational community must be assured that Iraq\r\nno longer has the capacity to develop or use\r\nweapons of mass destruction; missing Kuwaiti and\r\nthird country nationals must be accounted for; and\r\nKuwait\u0027s irreplaceable archives must be returned.\r\nMeanwhile, the people of Iraq continue to suffer the\r\neffects of sanctions”.\r\nFor purely humanitarian reasons enjoined by our\r\nIslamic religion and by all other religious as well as\r\ninternational principles and norms, the State of Kuwait\r\nurges Iraq to put an immediate end to the plight of\r\nKuwaiti and third-country prisoners, returning them to\r\ntheir families or fully accounting for them. Iraqi\r\ninsistence that there are no such prisoners inside Iraq and\r\nthat these people should be considered as missing persons\r\nis not an answer. What is at stake are the lives of people,\r\nwho should be treated as trusts in our collective\r\nconscience. Since last January, Iraq has been boycotting\r\nthe meetings of the Tripartite Commission and its\r\ntechnical subcommittee, bodies that operate under the\r\naegis of the ICRC with the objective of locating and\r\nidentifying those innocent victims.\r\nThe following questions arise here. Is Iraq indeed\r\nserious in dealing with this important humanitarian\r\nmatter? Does Iraq\u0027s attitude show any good faith? Would\r\nanyone safely claim that Iraq is working on implementing\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions while boycotting the\r\nmeetings of ICRC-sponsored humanitarian bodies?\r\nOnly internationally established institutions can handle\r\nthis issue. We believe that earnest and sincere cooperation\r\nwith the Tripartite Commission is the key to the resolution\r\nof this humanitarian problem, which really does not tolerate\r\nany further delay.\r\nAn intensive effort is currently under way within the\r\nSecurity Council to pass a new resolution related to the\r\nremaining obligations on Iraq, taking into consideration the\r\nrecommendations made by the three aforementioned\r\nevaluation panels. While Kuwait concurs with the good\r\nintentions underlying the current efforts by members of the\r\nSecurity Council, which take the form of a draft resolution\r\nput forward by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands,\r\ntogether with some other related views, we would like to\r\nreaffirm the important need to maintain the unity of the\r\nSecurity Council in dealing with this issue. Also, we\r\ndemand assurances that Iraq will remain committed to all\r\nthe requirements of Security Council resolution 687 (1991),\r\nwhich should be treated as one indivisible political and\r\nlegal unit.\r\nIn the meantime, Kuwait reiterates its full sympathy\r\nwith the suffering of our brotherly people of Iraq. The\r\nGovernment of Iraq alone bears full responsibility for the\r\nperpetuation of those hardships. Kuwait, for its part,\r\nconfirms its support for and endorsement of all Security\r\nCouncil resolutions aimed at easing those travails through\r\nthe oil-for-food programme. Furthermore, we wish to\r\nreiterate our firm commitment to the need for the\r\npreservation of the independence, sovereignty, unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of Iraq.\r\nOut of concern for and interest in bolstering the\r\nunderpinnings of security and stability in our region, the\r\nState of Kuwait confirms its support for all efforts aimed at\r\nresolving the dispute between the United Arab Emirates and\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran over the Emirates\u0027 three islands\r\nby peaceful means. These would include the referral of the\r\nmatter to the International Court of Justice. In the\r\nmeantime, Kuwait welcomes the willingness of the friendly\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran to start direct negotiations with the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates. We hope the tripartite ministerial\r\ncommission formed by the Cooperation Council of the Gulf\r\nArab States will be able to initiate working mechanisms for\r\nbeginning direct negotiations that could lead to the peaceful\r\nresolution of the dispute over the three Emirates\u0027 islands:\r\nthe Lesser and Greater Tunbs and Abu Musa. This avenue\r\nwould indeed contribute to confidence building and to the\r\npromotion of security and stability throughout the region.\r\nIt would also expand and deepen cooperation between the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran and all States in the region.\r\nKuwait welcomes the Sharm El-Sheikh\r\nMemorandum recently signed between the Palestinian\r\nAuthority and Israel, which sets forth specific steps for\r\nthe implementation of the Wye River accords. However,\r\nwe demand that the new Administration in Israel do its\r\npart on reviving the peace process and resuming\r\nnegotiations on all tracks. Israel must demonstrate honest\r\ncommitment to the principles and operational framework\r\nof the overall peace process, which is anchored in\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)\r\nand the land-for-peace formula. This includes fulfilment\r\nof all obligations and agreements signed with the\r\nPalestinian Authority within the peace process, with a\r\nview to reinstating all legitimate Arab rights, including\r\nthe restoration to the brotherly Palestinian people of their\r\nfull national rights, especially the establishment of their\r\nindependent State on their national territory, with\r\nJerusalem as its capital. The Government of Israel must\r\nalso cease forthwith its illegitimate settlement-building\r\nand land-confiscation policy. It should also end its\r\nunilateral measures to create de facto realities on the\r\nground, especially in the city of Jerusalem. Furthermore,\r\nPalestinian refugees must be reassured of their right to\r\nreturn to their homes in accordance with relevant United\r\nNations resolutions.\r\nWe are baffled by, and accordingly reject, the\r\nreferences, declarations and insinuations recently made\r\nthat promote the notion of resettling the Palestinian\r\nrefugees outside their own ancestral homeland. Such a\r\nnotion represents a stark violation of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of international law, United Nations resolutions\r\nand the inalienable right to self-determination.\r\nFurthermore, a resettlement plan would be an\r\ninfringement on the sovereignty of other States and an\r\ninterference in their domestic affairs.\r\nIsrael\u0027s withdrawal from the occupied Syrian territory\r\nin the Golan Heights back to the 4 June 1967 lines is\r\nindeed the litmus test of Israel\u0027s genuine commitment to\r\nthe land-for-peace principle. Moreover, we demand that\r\nIsrael end once and for all its repeated acts of aggression\r\nagainst the sovereignty and independence of our sister\r\nState, the Lebanese Republic. We stress the need for an\r\nimmediate Israeli pull-out from southern Lebanon and\r\nWest Bekaa in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978), which must be implemented\r\nwithout any restrictions or conditions. In this context,\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nKuwait emphatically notes that the Syrian and Lebanese\r\ntracks must be recognized as organically interconnected if\r\na just and lasting peace is to be established.\r\nIn addition, while Kuwait endorses and appreciates the\r\nefforts of the two sponsors of the peace process, together\r\nwith the European Union, to revitalize that process, we call\r\nupon all of them to redouble their efforts at this critical\r\nstage of the peace process.\r\nAt the regional level, and given the long-standing\r\nhistorical and human bonds, as well as the close economic\r\ninterests fashioned by the geographic location of the\r\nArabian Gulf region and its proximity to India and\r\nPakistan, with which the State of Kuwait maintains friendly\r\nrelations, we appeal to both countries to resolve their\r\nbilateral dispute over Jammu and Kashmir by peaceful\r\nmeans and in accordance with United Nations resolutions.\r\nWe sincerely hope that India and Pakistan will engage in a\r\nmeaningful dialogue and draw on the deep and rich\r\nreservoir of wisdom available to the leaderships on both\r\nsides of the divide. We think that their economic resources\r\nwould better be utilized for the development and welfare of\r\ntheir peoples and for enhancing security and stability in that\r\nsensitive region. Mutual confidence and cooperation should\r\nprevail over intense rivalry in the arena of terror.\r\nKuwait welcomes the outcome of the popular\r\nconsultation held under United Nations supervision in East\r\nTimor late last month. The ballot gave the East Timorese\r\nthe chance to determine their future freely, with the\r\nguarantee and cooperation of the friendly Government of\r\nIndonesia. Kuwait has followed with sadness and pain the\r\nbloody events that have taken place in East Timor.\r\nHowever, we welcome the Security Council resolution to\r\nestablish a multinational force to put an end to violence and\r\nto restore security and public order to that Territory. We\r\nwish that force full success in its mission. We also call\r\nupon neighbouring countries to respect the mandate of the\r\nforce and to help the people of East Timor fulfil their\r\nlegitimate aspirations. In this regard, Kuwait wishes to give\r\ncredit to the friendly Government of Indonesia for its\r\ncommitment and efforts at putting an end to the violence,\r\nthe killing and destruction that ravaged East Timor in the\r\nwake of the referendum. Credit is also due Indonesia for\r\nagreeing to the formation and peaceful reception of the\r\nmultinational force.\r\nStill on the international scene, Kuwait welcomes the\r\npeace accord reached between the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on\r\nKosovo as a first step towards the resolution of the dispute\r\nand the return of displaced persons to their homes in\r\nKosovo. This will eventually put an end to the conflict\r\nand restore peace and security to the people, who have\r\nthe right to live in freedom and dignity.\r\nThe Balkan crisis, which was precipitated by the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, has demonstrated once\r\nagain that the United Nations role is indispensable to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and for\r\nlending legitimacy and credibility to any solutions\r\nreached, be it in a regional context or an international\r\none. Kuwait supports and encourages the United Nations\r\nto continue its role until all aspects of the crisis have\r\ndefinitively resolved.\r\nThe world today is living through a communications\r\nrevolution that has helped to shorten distances between\r\nStates and to speed up global connections, thus turning\r\nour planet into a village where people instantly react to\r\nevents that take place anywhere across the globe.\r\nInternational economic integration has become part and\r\nparcel of development plans and programmes that aim at\r\nachieving progress and prosperity for nations. Unilateral\r\nisolationist policies have become relics of the past and\r\nuntenable under a new world order that is becoming\r\nincreasingly and rapidly universal.\r\nThe new order, known as “globalization”, requires\r\njoint efforts in order to lay down the principles,\r\nregulations and arrangements that seek to ensure progress\r\nand well-being by creating new prospects for the flow of\r\nfinancial and technical aid to help national States project\r\ntheir ability to contribute to the building of a better future\r\nfor humanity. Hence, developed countries are expected to\r\nincrease their economic and technical assistance to\r\ndeveloping States and to expand the exchange of\r\ninformation and technical know-how in an attempt to\r\nnarrow the ever-widening gap in the fields of technology\r\nand communications.\r\nMoreover, international efforts must be invigorated\r\nin the face of a new emerging challenge posed by the\r\ndwindling sources of fresh water. Water reserves should\r\nbe utilized on a just basis and with a sense of sharing in\r\nthe use of this main artery of life itself. Bearing that\r\nvision in mind, Kuwait is pursuing its efforts to support\r\ndevelopment projects in many developing countries. The\r\nKuwait Fund for Economic Development offers long-term\r\nfinancial loans at concessional interest rates. Also, my\r\ncountry contributes, within its means, to many\r\ndevelopment projects and programmes that are jointly\r\nfinanced by international financial institutions, regional\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\norganizations and the United Nations agencies. Kuwait\r\nintends to pursue this path out of its conviction that\r\ndevelopment is the key to progress and a main incentive for\r\nbuilding security and stability. Furthermore, reaching out\r\nwith assistance to those in need is a moral obligation on\r\nthose who are more privileged. This would indeed\r\nstrengthen international cooperation, openness and mutual\r\nrespect among nations.\r\nNow, as our world is about to bid farewell to the\r\ncurrent century, good-hearted and decent people nurture\r\nvarious hopes and ambitions for serving humanity and\r\nbuilding a better life on this small planet. We all hope to\r\ncreate and conserve a safe and healthy environment, free of\r\nthreats to the security of all life. As we look down the road\r\nto the future, we can hopefully see a fulfilment of the\r\ndivine prophecy of justice for humanity when we heed\r\nGod\u0027s words, calling on us to feed the hungry and to ensure\r\npeace of mind and security for all human beings. We wish\r\nworld leaders who will be assembled in this Hall in\r\nSeptember next year success in defining a road map for the\r\nfuture, in setting a new vision and in renewing our common\r\nresolve to establish peace, justice and development for all\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call on\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay and President\r\nof the preceding session of the General Assembly, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti.\r\nMr. Opertti (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Allow me\r\nfirst, on behalf of my Government and myself, to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Namibia, on his well-deserved election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. We wish him every success and assure him of my\r\ndelegation\u0027s sincere cooperation in carrying out his work.\r\nI also wish to express a warm welcome to the new\r\nMembers: the Republics of Kiribati and Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga.\r\nA little more than a week ago, we had the opportunity\r\nto address this same body at the close the fifty-third session\r\nof the General Assembly. On that occasion, we expressed\r\na general view of the Organization as a whole, as well as\r\nof some of the items or questions of greater relevance. That\r\nview cannot differ basically from the one I am now\r\nexpressing as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay.\r\nIn order to contribute to the debate of ideas, we did\r\nnot silence then, nor will we now, certain views on the\r\ninternational community, on the changes it is experiencing\r\nand on the response capability of the United Nations to\r\nface the new situations or expectations of the Member\r\nStates, especially the demands of regions or areas of the\r\nworld experiencing diverse types of suffering.\r\nThis suffering is at times basically economic in\r\norigin — call it underdevelopment or more simply,\r\npoverty and even extreme destitution — with all the\r\nattending consequences of marginalization and exclusion.\r\nIn other cases, suffering stems from problems of\r\ncivilization that tend to show alarming signs of\r\ndeterioration. We must also emphasize that the turmoil\r\nand instability experienced by peoples are not in every\r\ncase due to one and the same cause, whether of a material\r\nor economic nature or because of the lack of resources.\r\nWe observe phenomena such as violence,\r\ndramatically present at the individual or collective level;\r\nterrorism of all kinds, blind and relentless; and, of course,\r\nthe drug problem in its diverse stages, including the\r\nentrepreneurial business of its traffic and its perverse\r\ndestabilizing effect, and drug consumption, which is\r\ndestructive to the individual and is also related to family\r\ndissolution. There is also the absence of or weakness in\r\neducational standards that adequately prioritize the ethical\r\ndimension and human values as a great pedagogical goal.\r\nPerhaps none of us yet possesses the key to explain\r\nthe real origin of these pathological phenomena, but what\r\nis very clear is that we cannot affect ignorance about\r\nthem, as if they were foreign to us — Governments,\r\nStates, peoples and organizations.\r\nWithout prejudice to what was just said, we\r\nrecognize first the central role the Organization must play\r\nin terms of international peacekeeping and security. On\r\nthe other hand, it is necessary to give special attention to\r\nthe dreadful consequences of nationalist excesses, to\r\nconfront the exclusive and unfair fundamentalism of\r\nreligions, to fight discrimination, whatever the basic\r\nclaims or pretexts are, and to make tolerance a basic\r\nprinciple of relations among individuals and peoples. All\r\nare unavoidable duties of the United Nations.\r\nWe must now establish and reaffirm our position as\r\na Member State on those main items — some of which\r\nare planned, others under way and others still to come —\r\nregarding what is to be done.\r\nI refer first to the reform of the Organization and of\r\nthe Charter, and in particular to the reform of the Security\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nCouncil. These are priorities that must continue at a pace\r\nimposed by the complexity of the matter, by the current\r\nstate of international relations and, above all, by the\r\nexpectation of world public opinion that moves\r\nmomentarily from hope to anxiety. If it is true, as it is said,\r\nthat time takes revenge on things done without prior\r\nconsultation, it is just as true that medicine refined for a\r\nlong time, as the Italian master Carnelutti reminds us, could\r\narrive too late, when the patient is already dead.\r\nReform requires a balance, a balance between sudden\r\nneed and efficiency, between rigidity and flexibility and\r\nbetween unavoidable principles and the just appreciation of\r\nnew realities. In favour of this balance, the General\r\nAssembly approved in November 1998 resolution 53/30,\r\nrequiring at least a two-thirds majority for the approval of\r\nany reform relating to the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. This dispelled concern about a reform being\r\napproved by non-representative majorities, opening up a\r\nnew phase. This is contained in the report of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on reform of the Security Council,\r\nestablished by consensus by the General Assembly by\r\nresolution 48/26, in the chapter entitled “Observations”.\r\nIt will be your task, Mr. President, to give renewed\r\nmomentum to this process on the basis of its progress and\r\nof other steps which, however modest and far from\r\nresolving the matter, advance in denoting certain basic\r\npoints concerning which there is at least a common\r\ndiagnosis. Although distant from final solutions, these\r\npoints are always adjustable to the changes of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Government of Uruguay, my country — an active\r\nMember State of this Organization and of other world and\r\nregional organizations, both political and integration\r\nones — has observed and continues to see well-constituted\r\ninternational institutions as the main guarantee for the\r\nobservance a more just, foreseeable and fair international\r\norder. Therefore, when distinguishing the vital from the\r\nsuperficial and rhetorical speech from the true search for\r\nagreements, which can involve reciprocal concessions, the\r\ndelegation of Uruguay will be in favour of change and\r\nagainst stagnation — but not just any change. It will favour\r\nchange that restores to the United Nations a level of\r\ninternational recognition which, without sacrificing efficacy,\r\nwould make the Member States and their regions feel that\r\nthey are a tangible and active reality, that those subregions\r\ncannot be under-represented.\r\nThere is no longer a place for an elitist international\r\nsociety that freezes obsolete historical periods in time,\r\ntypical of a dialectic of confrontation measured in terms\r\nof the cold war. We must propose new formulas to avoid\r\nthe effect of blockage that in many cases produces the\r\nconspicuous right to veto, granting the Security Council\r\nthe procedural means to break it and even entrusting the\r\nGeneral Assembly, under certain conditions, as proposed\r\nby my delegation, with new competencies so that it could\r\nbe formally informed and its decision be required in\r\nsituations which demand it, particularly when it concerns\r\ncases that could involve the legitimate use of force.\r\nThe recent problem in Kosovo, which continues,\r\ncould serve as a typical example of the aforementioned\r\nparalysing effect of the veto in the Security Council,\r\nwithout forgetting the disturbing consequences that effect\r\nwould have in producing the marginalization of the\r\nUnited Nations system of peace and security, with the\r\nresulting questioning of the Organization itself and its real\r\npossibilities.\r\nThis, naturally, requires the foresight of international\r\nlaw as the sole source of legitimacy, without ignoring the\r\nauthentic and grave humanitarian situations that are\r\nimposed on us by the drama of the real facts at a time\r\nwhen they require a formal framework of timely,\r\nlegitimate and efficient international action.\r\nWe also attach special meaning to the improvement\r\nof the rules of procedure and the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council, and we therefore trust that the proposals\r\nelaborated by the Open-ended Working Group will be\r\nadopted.\r\nAn optimistic initiative of the Organization,\r\nencouraged by the Secretariat and the Member States, is\r\nundoubtedly the so-called millennium summit, which will\r\ntake place at the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Regarding its agenda, there will be a certain\r\ntendency in favour of approving a main topic of common\r\ninterest, capable of stirring the attention and participation\r\nof heads of State and Government.\r\nAs this is the most important point now under debate\r\nhere, and since I wished to contribute when I was\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, I now say quite\r\nsimply that in our view the main theme should be “The\r\nUnited Nations: its future viability”. This would generate,\r\nlike the organs of a single body, related fundamental\r\nissues, perhaps formulated as important questions, such\r\nas: Towards a new system of international security? Does\r\nglobalization demand new strategies of the world\r\nOrganization? What more concrete strategies can there be\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nfor the elimination of poverty and underdevelopment? How\r\ncan we review the system for the protection of human\r\nrights, with a view to strengthening and improving them,\r\nparticularly in the fields of the family, children, education\r\nand international cooperation?\r\nNaturally, we are aware that for the millennium\r\nsummit to be successful and give hope for the next century,\r\nits agenda must reflect the expectations of Member States,\r\nwhich still show marked differences. My Government will\r\ncontinue to participate in the preparation of the summit with\r\ninterest and in a responsible manner.\r\nThe initiative for dialogue between civilizations —\r\n2001 is to be the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations — proposed by Iran and approved by\r\nconsensus by the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession — is the kind of topic that is at the heart of the\r\nUnited Nations role and should be studied in depth. We are\r\nconvinced of the great importance of examining with\r\nextreme care the cultural diversity of Member States in\r\norder to know each other better, but at the same time\r\nunderstand the profound reasons why, despite our diversity,\r\nwe are all Member States of a unique universal\r\nOrganization: the United Nations.\r\nSupport and respect for the San Francisco Charter is\r\nundoubtedly the starting point of any responsible dialogue.\r\nThe Government of Uruguay will contribute its ideas and\r\ninitiatives, joining in the efforts of all delegations to\r\nimprove the international habitat through understanding and\r\ntolerance of peoples and ideas.\r\nWithout prejudice to the important progress made\r\ntowards the establishment of a normative system against the\r\nproliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,\r\nUruguay considers it essential to take new steps in this\r\ndirection through the universalization of the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), whose\r\nnorms must be recognized and accepted by all States.\r\nThe abusive use of light weapons or small arms — a\r\nsubject of great debate — whose uncontrolled proliferation\r\nis reaching unacceptable levels, with devastating effects, in\r\nsome cases worse than those caused by weapons of massive\r\ndestruction, is a field in which the United Nations must\r\nplay a fundamental role, as already reflected in the\r\nconvening of an international conference to deal with the\r\nillicit traffic in small arms, a conference which Uruguay\r\nfirmly supports.\r\nMy country strongly believes in the need to replace\r\nthe “culture of conflict” with a “culture of peace”, so that,\r\nas wisely stated by the Under-Secretary-General for\r\nDisarmament Affairs, Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, “As the\r\ntwentieth century witnessed the creation of nuclear\r\nweapons, the twenty-first century will see their\r\ndestruction”. The entry into force last March of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\r\nTheir Destruction is an auspicious sign.\r\nA most significant milestone in the endless search\r\nfor effective international ways to protect human rights\r\nwas the signing of the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court in Rome in July 1998, during the same\r\nyear in which the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights was celebrated. Uruguay is\r\nparticipating and will continue to participate seriously in\r\nthe elaboration of complementary rules and procedural\r\nprovisions to give the Court the basic elements to\r\nguarantee that it can work properly. When that process is\r\ncompleted the matter will come before our legislative\r\nbodies for consideration, in accordance with our\r\nConstitution.\r\nIn conclusion, the topics that concern and will\r\ncontinue to concern the United Nations are multiple and\r\ndiverse. At this very moment, for example, an instrument\r\nthat has shown its effectiveness on various occasions is\r\nbeing employed again: the peacekeeping operation. I refer\r\nhere to the one taking place in East Timor, with the prime\r\ngoal of ensuring that the mandate of the Timorese people\r\nis implemented, and of preserving the lives and physical\r\nintegrity of that people.\r\nNaturally, the environment, which is under attack,\r\nparadoxically as much by unregulated over-development\r\nas by poverty, will continue to be on the Organization\u0027s\r\nagenda, as well as the topic of population and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBut perhaps the essential need is to make the\r\nmaximum effort to make the United Nations the point of\r\nreference for all States, the most powerful and the\r\nweakest — the former so that they yield to the\r\ninternational order and the latter so that they adjust to it,\r\nand find in the Organization their best shield. For all\r\nStates it means access to a modernity that will develop\r\nthem and make them part of the current technical\r\ninnovation, which is supported by the information\r\nrevolution through which all of us, in one way or another,\r\nwill be introduced to the coming century.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker is His Excellency The Honourable Lakshman\r\nKadirgamar, Member of Parliament and Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Kadirgamar (Sri Lanka): Allow me first to\r\nextend to our President\u0027s distinguished predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Didier Opertti, Foreign Minister of Uruguay,\r\nPresident of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly,\r\nour gratitude for the excellent manner in which he\r\nconducted the work of the previous session.\r\nAllow me also to offer to the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga the\r\ncongratulations and warmest good wishes of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Sri Lanka on their election\r\nto membership of the General Assembly of the United\r\nNations. We welcome them and assure them of our\r\nunstinted support as they take up their places in the\r\nAssembly of nations.\r\nOur President\u0027s well-deserved election to the chair of\r\nthis historic final session of the General Assembly of the\r\nUnited Nations for the twentieth century gives us great\r\npleasure. Many of us, Foreign Ministers, have known him\r\nwell over the years. We have worked with him, and we\r\nhave greatly admired the energy and dedication that he has\r\nbrought to the performance of his duties as the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of his country. The developing countries in\r\nparticular have cause to remember with gratitude the role\r\nhe has played in the deliberations of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and the G-77. He brings to his office wide\r\nexperience of the systems and practices of the United\r\nNations. He also brings to his office a high degree of\r\nsensitivity to the important issues of the day.\r\nI noticed with keen interest that in his opening\r\nstatement to the Assembly the President referred in\r\nconsiderable detail to the problem of child soldiers. This\r\nreference was particularly heartening to me as I had, on the\r\nbasis of the Graca Machel report, first brought the issue of\r\nchild soldiers to the attention of the Assembly in the course\r\nof my address in 1997. In Sri Lanka a rebel group has for\r\nseveral years been conscripting children, even as young as\r\n10, for battle. Even worse, it has been making children,\r\ngirls and boys, into suicide bombers, thus creating a\r\nhorrible new phenomenon of depravity and cruelty that the\r\nworld has never seen before. If the conscience of the world\r\nis not outraged by the tragic fate of these children in my\r\ncountry, then nothing will move us to action in defence of\r\nthe young and the helpless anywhere. In his opening\r\naddress to the General Assembly, the President referred\r\nto the boast of the “soulless recruiters” that children\r\n“are numerous and readily available, more malleable\r\nand impressionable, learn quickly, are small and\r\nagile, and quite simply require less food and\r\nsupplies than adults”.\r\nHe described their fate as “horrendous” and said that in\r\nhis view it\r\n“demands that the United Nations show renewed\r\ncommitment and redouble its efforts as the\r\nrepository of humanity\u0027s conscience and social\r\njustice in the world.” (A/54/PV.1)\r\nThe President referred to the work being done by inter-\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations to save\r\nchildren, and exhorted them to\r\n“continue to blame and shame Governments for not\r\ndoing enough to protect our children\u0027s lives and their\r\nfuture.” (ibid)\r\nBut in some countries Governments are completely\r\nblameless. In Sri Lanka no Government, either before\r\nindependence 50 years ago or after, has ever recruited\r\nchildren under 18 years of age into the armed forces. In\r\nmy country it is only the Liberation Tigers of Tamil\r\nEelam (LTTE) that resorts to this abominable practice.\r\nThese rebel groups are beyond the pale of the law. They\r\nacknowledge no international conventions. They are not\r\nanswerable to any international body. And yet they must\r\nbe brought to book. Some of them, the LTTE included,\r\noperate with impunity in certain countries, wearing the\r\ninnocent garb of charitable, religious or social\r\norganizations. They collect money for ostensibly anodyne\r\npurposes. But in fact the money goes to buy weapons for\r\nwar. And, in truth, host Governments which provide\r\nshelter to these organizations under the umbrella of liberal\r\nlaws of asylum and immigration know, or could easily\r\nfind out, that those moneys are going to fuel the very war\r\ninto which young children are being dragooned. These\r\nGovernments adopt as their explanation for inaction the\r\nimpeccable excuse that they do not have laws under\r\nwhich fund-raising for terrorist purposes can be punished.\r\nThis is true, but it will soon cease to be true when the\r\nconvention for the suppression of the financing of\r\nterrorism is adopted — we hope and pray — at this fifty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly, requiring all\r\nsignatory States to enact domestic legislation in keeping\r\nwith the provisions of the convention.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThe Secretary-General in his report (S/1999/957) to\r\nthe Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed\r\nconflict has recommended that the Security Council urge\r\nMember States to support the proposal to raise the\r\nminimum age for recruitment and participation in hostilities\r\nto 18, and demand that non-State actors involved in conflict\r\nnot use children below the age of 18 in hostilities, or face\r\nthe imposition of targeted sanctions if they do not comply.\r\nOne of the most effective sanctions would be the\r\nproscription of such organizations in countries where they\r\npresently collect money without let or hindrance, or their\r\nbeing named terrorist organizations, as by the United States\r\nof America, for instance, and the consequent illegalization\r\nof their activities.\r\nSince 1997 there has been considerable progress on\r\nthe question of child soldiers. The issue is now on centre\r\nstage. Regional conferences have been held, and a world\r\nconference is to be held next year. The office of the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary General for Children and\r\nArmed Conflict is operational. A growing number of\r\ncountries refer to this issue in the General Assembly and at\r\nother forums. Most recently the Foreign Ministers of the\r\nNordic Countries roundly condemned the practice and\r\npledged their support for its eradication. The Security\r\nCouncil has unanimously adopted its first-ever resolution on\r\nthe plight of children. The first decade of the next\r\nmillennium has been designated the International Decade\r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children\r\nof the World. And the President stated that he would make\r\nit his business to add his “voice and devotion to” the\r\n“laudable efforts to make the twenty-first century one\r\nof love and security for every child in the world.”\r\n(ibid)\r\nIn Sri Lanka we have decided to set up a rehabilitation\r\ncentre for the children who desert the rebel army. The task\r\nof restoring them to health and normalcy is a daunting one.\r\nIt is a task for which we can certainly use all the help we\r\ncan get from those who have experience in that field.\r\nMy plea to the General Assembly today, two years\r\nafter I first brought up the question of child soldiers, is that\r\nwe must proceed with the utmost dispatch to rescue these\r\nchildren from their fate. They are already scarred; if we do\r\nnot act quickly they will be scarred beyond redemption.\r\nWe leave the twentieth century with many spectacular\r\nachievements behind us. But let us make no mistake — we\r\nmove into the twenty-first century carrying with us old,\r\nintractable problems that have been with us since the dawn\r\nof time. As the present century draws to a close, new\r\nproblems of unparalleled menace and danger have\r\nemerged. They will undoubtedly occupy our attention well\r\ninto the next century.\r\nPoverty, illiteracy, ill-health, hunger, unemployment,\r\nuncontrolled urbanization, the growth of mega cities —\r\nthese are old problems which deeply affect over half of\r\nhumanity.\r\nWe have not addressed these problems with\r\nsufficient vigour over the past decades. While the United\r\nNations systems were set up to tackle these problems, the\r\ncapacity of the system to deliver results has been grossly\r\ninadequate.\r\nThe challenge of fighting human poverty must\r\nnecessarily continue to have the highest priority. The poor\r\ncontinue to become poorer, remaining deprived of the\r\nbasic necessities of life. This is morally outrageous in an\r\nera of abundance and conspicuous consumption. Poverty\r\ndegrades humanity and is a threat to the most basic of all\r\nhuman rights. The onus is on us to unite, to wage a moral\r\nwar, to eliminate the scourge of poverty from our midst.\r\nSri Lanka is of the view that any development\r\nagenda of the future must contain a social dimension and\r\nassure protection to the most vulnerable elements of our\r\nsociety. It is in this regard that the international\r\ncommunity must move beyond the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative. By revising the criteria of\r\nclassification, we would expand the number of countries\r\nthat could be helped towards achieving meaningful\r\nreduction in both the stock of debt and its servicing. Debt\r\nrelief and official development assistance, which has been\r\ndwindling in recent years, should be restored to its former\r\nlevels, void of conditionality, at least for the least\r\ndeveloped countries. A positive step would be the\r\ncancellation of their foreign debt. This would help release\r\ntheir very limited resources for social and poverty\r\nalleviation programmes. They must be urgently put on the\r\npath to sustainable development, if they are to survive.\r\nThough relieving these countries of a major portion of\r\ntheir debt burden is a commendable step, it is equally\r\nimportant to ensure that they do not relapse into the\r\npoverty trap.\r\nThe time has come for the countries of the South to\r\nformulate an effective and implementable economic\r\nagenda. The recommendations of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement ad hoc panel of economists are of primary\r\nimportance in organizing the substantive work of the\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nagenda for the South. They include the need for the\r\nelaboration and regular updating of the developing\r\ncountries\u0027 agenda; development of a networking system\r\nbetween countries of the South, involving specialists and\r\nresearchers in the various fields of importance; an economic\r\ncoordination scheme to help identify and analyse aspects of\r\ninternational economic and trade-related issues; and the\r\nassembling and launching of expert groups, which could\r\nmobilize those national and inter-South institutions, like the\r\nSouth Centre in Geneva.\r\nThe South Centre could be a possible coordinating\r\nmechanism, which could facilitate the implementation of\r\nthe South agenda. With the increased marginalization of\r\ndeveloping countries in matters of international finance and\r\ntrade, it is imperative that we urgently put in place a\r\ncoordinating mechanism to implement the recommendations\r\nmade by the ad hoc panel of economists.\r\nThe general thrust of globalization and liberalization\r\nof the international economy has now become irreversible.\r\nThe growing linkages between countries, the opening up of\r\nmarkets, the spread of investments, the impact of\r\ntechnology on standardizing products, the shrinking of\r\ndistances and the speed of modern communications, offer\r\nnew windows of opportunity for developing countries,\r\nespecially if their positive aspects are seized upon and their\r\npitfalls avoided. The task facing us in the developing world\r\ntoday is one of adapting this twin process to conform to our\r\nown specific requirements and priorities. This, in our view,\r\nwould be the primary objective of an economic agenda of\r\nthe South in the evolving global economy of the future.\r\nAlthough there have been significant developments in\r\nthe world economy under the influence of the doctrine of\r\nglobalization and liberalization, it is imperative to recognize\r\nits limitations and drawbacks where developing countries\r\nare concerned. We need to grapple with the reality and\r\nshake off any feelings of complacency. It is now\r\nincreasingly evident that the benefits of globalization have\r\nby and large bypassed much of the developing world,\r\ndespite strict adherence to the tenets of the structural\r\nadjustment policies. The poorest among us — spanning the\r\ncontinents of Africa, Central America and Asia — have\r\nexperienced increasing marginalization in the world\r\neconomy.\r\nSurveying the South, we find it evident that\r\nglobalization and liberalization have, paradoxically,\r\nincreased the economic gap between rich and poor\r\ncountries. This is the conclusion reached in the tenth United\r\nNations Development Programme Human Development\r\nReport. Domestic liberalization measures undertaken by\r\nmany of the developing countries have also contributed\r\ntowards a widening of the gap between the rich and the\r\npoor. A number of countries have recorded some\r\nacceleration of economic growth in the wake of\r\nliberalization and deregulation. But they have also\r\nwitnessed a shift in income distribution in favour of those\r\nin the upper income groups. Domestic policy reforms\r\nundertaken by a large number of developing counties in\r\nthe direction of liberalization and deregulation have not\r\nsecured for them a place on the “Globalization Express”.\r\nThe globalization and liberalization process is\r\nunfolding in a manner which gives developing countries\r\nlittle voice in shaping the policy framework that\r\nunderpins this procedure. The ad hoc panel of economists\r\nunder the aegis of the Non-Aligned Movement, which\r\nwas set up on a proposal made by Sri Lanka, has\r\nconcluded that there is very little opportunity for\r\ndeveloping countries to be represented at discussions and\r\nin the councils under which various aspects of the\r\nglobalization process are assessed, monitored and tailored.\r\nInitial optimism on globalization and liberalization\r\nis being replaced by anxiety and concern. The emergent\r\neconomies in Asia are in crisis, experiencing sharp\r\ndownward pressures on their currencies and capital\r\nmarkets and experiencing stresses, not only on their\r\neconomic structures, but also on their social fabric and\r\npolitical processes. Fears of widespread international\r\nrepercussions have borne fruit, and the impact of\r\ncontagion is all too evident. A bitter lesson that has\r\nbecome all too obvious is the vulnerability of economies\r\nto uncontrolled financial flows of various kinds,\r\nparticularly those of a speculative nature.\r\nThe globalization and liberalization environment\r\ncontains no safeguards to control and regulate\r\ndestabilizing forces in a situation in which rapid\r\nmovements of vast amounts of capital across national\r\nborders is a daily reality. The response of the multilateral\r\nfinancial institutions and the major Powers to the East\r\nAsian crisis has been ad hoc and ex post facto, but the\r\nneed in the first place was for preventive mechanisms.\r\nIn this milieu, Sri Lanka\u0027s response has been to\r\nmaintain as best it could a steady level of economic\r\ngrowth, despite an unfavourable external economic\r\nenvironment. Our capital account transactions have only\r\npartially been liberalized. In our view, foreign direct\r\ninvestment should be of a medium or long-term nature in\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\norder to discourage excessive outflow of short-term capital\r\nduring a financial crisis.\r\nIt is now virtually established wisdom that the least\r\ndeveloped countries have been increasingly marginalized in\r\nthe globalization and liberalization process. A restructuring\r\nof the global financial architecture must include special\r\nprotection for these most vulnerable segments of our global\r\nsociety. Since a crisis in any one part of the global structure\r\nhas the power to cause havoc in the rest of the world\r\neconomy, we must look beyond national solutions to global\r\nones, for both are now irrevocably interlinked.\r\nSri Lanka, as chair of the Group of 24, has taken a\r\nspecial interest in building a consensus among developing\r\ncountries on the issues of reforming the global financial\r\narchitecture, and also on the matter of implementation of\r\nWorld Trade Organization agreements. As a member of\r\nregional groupings, such as the Group of 15, the Group of\r\n77, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Bangladesh-India-\r\nMyanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation\r\n(BIMST-EC) and the Indian Ocean Rim Association for\r\nRegional Co-operation (IOR-ARC), and also as the current\r\nchair of the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation (SAARC), Sri Lanka hopes to play a part in\r\nevolving a developing country consensus on this issue and\r\ninitiating a healthy debate with developed countries, with\r\nthe hope of establishing a new, dynamic, mutually\r\nbeneficial international financial architecture. As a part of\r\nthis effort, we have been active in promoting a South-South\r\ndialogue and developing an agenda for the South.\r\nIn this connection, I wish to commend the\r\nobservations of the German Foreign Minister in his speech\r\nto the Assembly a few days ago. He said:\r\n“The United Nations third major task alongside\r\npeacekeeping and promoting human rights in the\r\ncoming century will be to bring about a reconciliation\r\nbetween rich and poor countries ... The development\r\nof the poorer and the poorest countries must not be\r\nleft to the invisible hand of the global market ... The\r\nrich countries have a responsibility to help poor\r\ncountries take advantage of globalization and enable\r\nthem to have a fairer share of the world economy by\r\nassisting them with internal reforms and by opening\r\nup markets ... Development cooperation in the\r\nbroadest sense must become one of the United Nations\r\ncore tasks to a greater degree than hitherto. Science\r\nand technology are geared far too much to the\r\nproblems of rich countries.” (A/54/PV.8)\r\nThe phenomenon of nations pooling their resources\r\nand strengths, either for collective security or economic\r\ndevelopment, has been a particular phenomenon of the\r\nsecond half of this century. South Asia has been no\r\nexception, the only difference being that the process of\r\nregional cooperation commenced relatively late — just 15\r\nyears ago — in comparison to other parts of the world.\r\nWe were also clear from the very outset that our\r\nendeavours were targeted solely for economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe early phase of regional cooperation in South\r\nAsia required the building of the necessary institutional\r\ncapacities of the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation (SAARC). Once these capacities were in\r\nplace, we began during the last decade to work on the\r\ncore issues of economic and commercial cooperation.\r\nWe have made some progress in tariff liberalization\r\nin South Asia under the SAARC Preferential Trading\r\nArrangement. This progress has given us the confidence\r\nto contemplate the more ambitious task of establishing a\r\nregional free-trade area. At the SAARC Summit in\r\nColombo hosted by Sri Lanka last year, a decision was\r\ntaken, and thereafter implemented, to begin drafting the\r\nlegal treaty for a free-trade regime.\r\nThe Colombo Summit also manifested our\r\ndetermination as a region to equip ourselves to maximize\r\nthe opportunities afforded by the process of globalization.\r\nOur Commerce Ministers have been meeting regularly to\r\nprepare for the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nMinisterial Meeting in Seattle. We will be spelling out in\r\nSeattle our views on the achievements so far of the\r\nmultilateral trading system that has now been put in place\r\nand the course corrections we believe are required. We\r\nhave also networked our central banks and finance\r\nMinistries since the Colombo Summit, to strengthen our\r\ncapacities to anticipate and cope with developments in the\r\ninternational financial system.\r\nThe economic focus of our regional cooperation has\r\nnot made us unmindful of our other primary objective,\r\nnamely of social advancement for our region. The\r\nchallenges our region faces are many. They relate to\r\neducation, the empowerment of women, health and\r\npopulation issues, and so on. We are trying to evolve a\r\nlink between regional goals and national programmes in\r\nthe social sector through a depoliticized common vision.\r\nTo this end we have, again after the Colombo Summit,\r\ncommenced work on a Social Charter for South Asia.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThe gains we have made in regional cooperation in\r\nSouth Asia are certainly not the material of which\r\nsensational headlines are made. In fact, they may even have\r\ngone unnoticed in some quarters. Yet we in South Asia\r\nknow that our achievements are incremental, durable and\r\nlong-lasting. Whatever may be the burdens imposed by\r\nhistory on our region, our common aspiration for the\r\ndevelopment and welfare of our peoples brings the\r\nGovernments of South Asia together in collective\r\nendeavour. Our organization has an inherent strength and\r\nresilience that has enabled it to weather serious crises in\r\nrelations between some of our members. It has emerged\r\nstronger after each such test of its capacity for collective\r\naction.\r\nAmong the new problems of unparalleled menace and\r\ndanger that have emerged towards the close of the present\r\ncentury are heightened terrorist activities in many countries\r\nand ever-proliferating criminal activities in the areas of\r\nnarcotics, human trafficking and arms smuggling. Every\r\ntime I have spoken from this rostrum, I have argued that\r\nterrorism must be tackled collectively if it is to be tackled\r\neffectively at all. In earlier years this plea seemed to fall on\r\ndeaf ears. But a rash of terrorist bombings in the West\r\ngalvanized the rich and powerful countries into action.\r\nToday we have one Convention in place and two others\r\nunder consideration at this very session. I am content this\r\nyear merely to reiterate my plea that there should be no\r\nrelaxation in the fight against terrorism. I urge other\r\ncountries, particularly in the West, to follow the lead of the\r\nUnited States of America in enacting legislation to outlaw\r\nterrorist organizations.\r\nIn the unfolding debate on the stand-off between state\r\nsovereignty and the rights of individuals being subjected to\r\nmassive human-rights violations, we must be careful to see\r\nthat terrorist organizations do not reap the benefit of\r\nmisplaced sympathy in situations of civil conflict. Those\r\nwho resort to terror in pursuit of their political objectives\r\nmust never be permitted or encouraged to believe that\r\nunremitting terror will ultimately bring its reward in\r\nrecognition and results. On the contrary, it is only the\r\nrecognition that a campaign of terror will put its exponents\r\nbeyond the pale of civilized discourse that will persuade\r\nterrorists to seek other ways of gaining a hearing.\r\nAt the close of this century it is relevant to ask of\r\nourselves this question: do moral considerations any longer\r\ninspire or motivate our actions, or have we been completely\r\novertaken by pragmatic considerations reflected in our\r\nrespective national interests, subjectively defined?\r\nI would like, in this context, to make an observation.\r\nWe have all heard the familiar jibe that a diplomat is\r\nsomeone who is paid to lie abroad for his country.\r\nIndeed, foreign relations and foreign policy have always\r\nhad the reputation of being somewhat amoral, the object\r\nbeing to secure some national advantage, with the\r\nmorality of the end, or of the means used to secure the\r\nend, being relatively unimportant. But the consequences\r\nof this approach for international relations have been\r\ndeplorable. The Charter of the United Nations commences\r\nwith these memorable words:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations\r\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has\r\nbrought untold sorrow to mankind, and\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights,\r\nin the dignity and worth of the human person, in the\r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\r\nand small, and\r\n“to establish conditions under which respect for\r\nthe obligations arising from treaties and other\r\nsources of international law can be maintained, and\r\n“to promote social progress and better standards\r\nof life in larger freedom”.\r\nOne has only to listen to these words to realize that\r\nthe 54 years that have elapsed since they were first stated\r\nhave brought serious disappointments. Not only has the\r\nworld experienced numerous wars, but nations and\r\npeoples have experienced many kinds of immoral\r\npressures and intimidation. Social progress and better\r\nstandards of life in larger freedom have, for many\r\nnations, been an ever-receding mirage. It is clear that\r\nthese noble aspirations need some backing, some\r\nstiffening, in their implementation.\r\nSome 2,500 years ago a great teacher was born in\r\nAsia. He was born a prince. He renounced the world and\r\nroamed the forests in search of truth until he received\r\nenlightenment. Let me recall that Buddhism was first\r\nestablished in the central plain of the River Ganges, just\r\nsouth of the Himalayas. From that beginning, at one time\r\nor another in the course of its history, the message of the\r\nEnlightened One spread to large areas of India, Pakistan\r\nand Afghanistan, to Sri Lanka, China and Japan, to\r\nIndonesia, Korea, Laos and Viet Nam, and to Myanmar\r\nand Thailand. I state this not with any sense of\r\ntriumphalism, but to note that this enormous expansion\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\ntook place in peace. No battles were fought, no cities\r\nbesieged and no crusades commenced to further the\r\nexpansion of Buddhism. And when, in accordance with the\r\nBuddha\u0027s teaching that all things are impermanent, the tide\r\nreceded, no battles were fought, no cities besieged and no\r\ncrusades commenced to stem that tide. For all of us who\r\nare concerned with statecraft, this holds a fundamental\r\nlesson.\r\nI would like to quote in this connection from the great\r\nBuddhist Emperor Asoka, who, as the Assembly knows,\r\nunderwent a radical change of heart through contact with\r\nthe Dhamma. In his often-quoted thirteenth rock edict at\r\nKalsi, he proclaimed:\r\n“And for the following purpose has this rescript on\r\nmorality been written, namely, in order that the sons\r\nand grandsons who may be born to me should not\r\nthink that a fresh conquest ought to be made; that, if\r\na conquest does please them, they should take pleasure\r\nin mercy and light punishments; and that they should\r\nregard the conquest by morality as the only true\r\nconquest”.\r\nNot only the freedom of thought, but also the\r\ntolerance allowed by the Buddha is astonishing to the\r\nstudent of the history of religions. Asoka, following this\r\nnoble example of tolerance and understanding, honoured\r\nand supported all other religions in his vast empire.\r\nThe Buddha was just as clear on politics, war and\r\npeace. It is well-known that Buddhism advocates and\r\npreaches non-violence and peace as its universal message\r\nand does not approve of any kind of violence or destruction\r\nof life. According to Buddhism, there is nothing that can be\r\ncalled a “just war”, which is only a false term coined and\r\nput into circulation to justify and excuse hatred, cruelty,\r\nviolence and massacre. Who decides what is just or unjust?\r\nThe mighty and the victorious are “just” and the weak and\r\nthe defeated are “unjust”. Buddhism does not accept this\r\nposition.\r\nAs the Buddha says:\r\n“The victor breeds hatred and the defeated lies down\r\nin misery. He who renounces both victory and defeat\r\nis happy and peaceful”.\r\nThe only conquest that brings peace and happiness is self-\r\nconquest:\r\n“One may conquer millions in battle, but he who\r\nconquers himself — only one — is the greatest of\r\nthe conquerors.”\r\nBuddhist philosophy contains much more of\r\nrelevance to statesmen. In the past decade the observance\r\nof human rights has been a source of great concern and\r\ndebate in international forums. In this connection, I would\r\nlike to quote the words of a scholar who has examined\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article by\r\narticle, from a Buddhist perspective. He said:\r\n“The importance of this Declaration as a common\r\nstandard of achievement for all peoples and all\r\nnations is now acknowledged everywhere. From the\r\nreligious angle, it is possible to state that in this\r\nDeclaration lie enshrined certain values and norms\r\nemphasized by the major religions of the world.\r\nThough not directly expressed, the basic principles\r\nof the Declaration are supported and reinforced by\r\nthese religious traditions, and among them the\r\ncontribution of the Buddhist tradition, to say the\r\nleast, is quite outstanding”.\r\nToday the teachings of the Buddha are studied and\r\npractised worldwide, and nowhere more avidly than in the\r\nWest. It is said that there are over 150 million known\r\nadherents of Buddhism in the world today. But if one\r\ntook into account the vast uncounted numbers of those\r\nwho practise Buddhism, that figure would be immensely\r\nhigher.\r\nAllow me, therefore, to suggest to this Assembly\r\nthat as the third millennium of human history opens it\r\nwould be fitting to recall the immense contribution to the\r\nunderstanding of the human condition that the teachings\r\nof the Buddha made 2,500 years ago. I suggest further\r\nthat it would be appropriate to honour the Buddha by\r\ndeclaring that Wesak, the sacred day for Buddhists the\r\nworld over, be observed as a special day by the United\r\nNations. Wesak marks the three most important events in\r\nthe life of the Buddha: his birth, his attainment of\r\nenlightenment and his passing away, all occurring on the\r\nfull-moon day of the month of May. This was the\r\nrecommendation made by an international Buddhist\r\nconference held in Colombo last November and attended\r\nby delegates from 26 countries. With the permission of\r\nthe President, a draft resolution to this effect, sponsored\r\nby a number of countries, will be introduced in the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its current session. The Government\r\nof Sri Lanka commends this draft resolution to the\r\nattention of the General Assembly.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mexico,\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Rosario Green, to whom I give the\r\nfloor.\r\nMrs. Green (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation welcomes the election of the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. Mexico knows him as an experienced diplomat\r\nwhose contribution will guarantee that our work strengthens\r\nthe ability of the United Nations to face the challenges of\r\nthe next century. In welcoming his election, we pay tribute\r\nto the constructive role Namibia plays on the international\r\nstage.\r\nMy delegation would also like to place on record its\r\nappreciation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, for his outstanding guidance of the\r\nfifty-third session.\r\nI wish also to express the satisfaction of Mexico at the\r\nadmission of the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to membership of the\r\nOrganization. Their presence among us strengthens\r\nuniversality, the very essence of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation is participating in this session with the\r\nwill to negotiate and the desire to cooperate that have\r\nalways characterized Mexico\u0027s foreign policy. We are\r\nconvinced that the proposals we make and results we\r\nachieve will contribute to designing the international order\r\nof the twenty-first century; we shall be an active participant\r\nin the debate.\r\nNow more than ever it seem essential that we review\r\nthe system we devised at San Francisco in the light of our\r\nexperiences over the past 54 years and of the progress\r\nachieved in the field of international law. In that review we\r\nmust ensure that the interests of all Member States are\r\ntaken into account in line with the Charter principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of States.\r\nMexico is proud of its multilateral outlook. My\r\ncountry has always seen the United Nations as the ideal\r\nforum to propose, negotiate and agree on solutions and\r\ncommon strategies that will enable us to face our collective\r\nchallenges. We Mexicans are convinced that it is imperative\r\nto spare no effort to make our Organization the primary\r\nforum for generating comprehensive policies, policies that\r\nguarantee lasting peace and security, and the development\r\nand welfare of all peoples on earth.\r\nAs it does every year, the General Assembly has a\r\nbroad and complex agenda before it at this session. I wish\r\ntherefore to focus my statement on three topics that I\r\nconsider to be of paramount importance for the future of\r\nthe Organization and of the community of nations: world\r\npeace and security; international cooperation in the field\r\nof natural disasters; and the financial architecture of the\r\nnew century.\r\nThe Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter state that\r\nfundamental aims of the peoples of the United Nations\r\nare to live together in peace and to solve their disputes\r\nwithout resorting to the use of force. The attainment of\r\nthose aims is our only guarantee if we yearn for a stable\r\nand secure international community that reveres friendly\r\nrelations and goodwill among all peoples and all nations.\r\nWe note with growing concern that, far from\r\ndisappearing, conflicts have multiplied and their nature\r\nhas changed as a consequence of the reshuffling of forces\r\nin the international arena. Today, these ever-proliferating\r\nconfrontations are to a great extent internal ones,\r\npresenting formidable challenges to an Organization\r\nconceived to resolve disputes between States. We still\r\nlack clear-cut mandates and a defined consensus on how\r\nto address this new state of affairs. This often divides us,\r\nnot on the ultimate goal — peace — but on the means to\r\nachieve it. Given the absence of a new political contract\r\nthat enjoys the support of all Members of the United\r\nNations, Mexico will continue firmly to maintain that the\r\nsearch for solutions to conflicts, whether they be internal\r\nor international, must be in conformity with the letter and\r\nthe spirit of the San Francisco Charter. Its principles\r\ncannot be subjected to interpretations varying with\r\ncircumstances or to unilateral whims. We cannot allow\r\nthe authority or the legitimacy of the Organization to be\r\ndamaged. We cannot accept actions that openly contradict\r\nthe intentions of the founders and that weaken the rights\r\nof the community of States.\r\nMexico has always maintained that the use of force,\r\neven when motivated by the loftiest humanitarian\r\nimpulses, is no solution; to the contrary, it generates\r\nfurther instability, uncertainty and violence. But my\r\ncountry has shown restraint when the Security Council\r\nhas acted in strict compliance with Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter. Even so, the Mexican Government reiterates the\r\nvalue of the peaceful settlement of disputes and firmly\r\nrejects the existence of an alleged right to intervene,\r\nparticularly when it is proclaimed outside the framework\r\nof international law.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThis is one of the most pressing challenges that we\r\nmust face as we move towards the new millennium.\r\nEssentially, we are striving to give the United Nations the\r\npolitical underpinning that will enable it to face new threats\r\nto peace and security in line with the thinking that inspired\r\nthe authors of the San Francisco Charter. If we fail, we run\r\nthe risk of eroding international negotiating tools and of\r\ndoing precisely what we want to avoid: weakening the\r\nOrganization.\r\nFor these reasons, my delegation invites all Member\r\nStates to begin an exercise in collective thinking that will\r\nenable us to solve the dilemma of humanitarian crises\r\ncaused by internal conflicts on the one hand and of the\r\ncapability of the United Nations to respond on the other.\r\nThis must be an exercise in deep thinking that will lead us\r\nto lasting solutions, which will both preserve peace and\r\nprotect the lives and human rights of those involved in\r\nconflicts.\r\nAllow me now to turn to another topic that I deem\r\ncentral to the future of the United Nations: international\r\ncooperation in the event of natural disaster. In view of the\r\nregrettable recurrence of natural disasters, it is urgent to\r\nthink about a creative and effective international division of\r\nlabour so that responses by countries, regions and\r\norganizations do not constitute isolated efforts or temporary\r\nrelief. They should instead constitute a comprehensive\r\nstrategy that will contribute to lasting stability.\r\nWe have all witnessed the sad consequences of natural\r\ncatastrophes. Recent experiences highlight the urgent need\r\nfor an effective machinery to address more rapidly and\r\nmore fully the needs of affected populations. These\r\nexperiences show also that at the very outset of the tragedy\r\nit is essential to mobilize broader support efforts to\r\ncontribute to full recovery in the shortest possible time.\r\nAt the regional level, the countries of Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean have taken important steps that serve as\r\nan example of the proposed new division of labour to deal\r\nwith natural disasters. In the declaration on technical\r\ncooperation for the prevention and relief of natural disasters\r\nadopted at the summit meeting of the Permanent\r\nMechanism for Political Consultation and Concertation (Rio\r\nGroup), held in Mexico City in May, we undertook the\r\ncommitment “to promote permanent measures of technical\r\ncooperation on every phase of natural disasters”. This\r\nmarks significant progress in the field of international\r\ncooperation. It aims not only to repair the damage but also\r\nto include preventive measures, and is designed to ensure\r\nassistance not only at the time of crisis but also during\r\nthe reconstruction period.\r\nLikewise, during their summit, held in June 1999 at\r\nRio de Janeiro, heads of State or Government of Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean and of the European Union\r\ndecided to launch an important programme of cooperation\r\nin the sphere of environmental and natural disasters. Its\r\ngoal is to help improve the capacity of the most\r\nvulnerable nations of both regions so we can prevent and\r\ndeal with disasters. To that end, they agreed to establish\r\nan appropriate system of international assistance at all\r\nphases from prevention and early warning to emergency\r\nassistance and mitigation, without neglecting rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that these experiences\r\ndeserve to be considered by this Assembly so that their\r\nmerits may be assessed and disseminated throughout the\r\nworld. The United Nations must play a central role in\r\nmaking this strategy international. It is urgent to have\r\nnational listings of civil defence organizations with\r\nupdated inventories of available resources to help in\r\ndisasters, and handbooks to guide us in the effective\r\nmanagement of international cooperation. In other words,\r\nthe Organization must respond in terms of who will\r\nprovide international cooperation when natural disasters\r\nstrike, what they will provide, and how they will provide\r\nit.\r\nLastly, I would like to refer to the financial\r\narchitecture of the new century. A year ago, in this same\r\nforum, I voiced the concern of Mexico about the harmful\r\neffects that financial crises have on our societies. At that\r\ntime, I proposed that the Member States, coordinated by\r\nthe Secretary-General, should undertake to reflect on how\r\nto improve our early-warning capacity in order to prevent\r\nand confront in a timely fashion the occurrence and\r\nproliferation of financial crises. This initiative found\r\nsupport in resolution 53/172, entitled “The financial crisis\r\nand its impact on growth and development, especially in\r\nthe developing countries”.\r\nSubsequently, we proposed to the Secretary-General\r\nthe undertaking of an effort at the regional level in Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean as part of a broader\r\nendeavour that will have to involve other areas, including\r\ndeveloped countries and the international financial\r\nagencies.\r\nEarlier this month, in close collaboration with the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nCaribbean, we held a meeting in Mexico City under the\r\nheading “Towards a stable and predictable international\r\nfinancial system linked to social development.” High-level\r\nGovernment officials of the countries of our region\r\nparticipated, as well as specialists and prominent officials\r\nof multilateral institutions working in financial and social\r\nfields.\r\nAt that meeting, we undertook an in-depth analysis of\r\nthe international financial architecture and its connection to\r\nthe social development of our peoples. We also reaffirmed\r\nour conviction that it is urgent and necessary to define a\r\nnew world financial scheme that includes a social\r\ndimension. The conclusions of that regional meeting have\r\nbeen conveyed to the Secretary-General, and I would like\r\nrefer to just a few of them.\r\nFirst, we participants expressed our concern over the\r\nfact that once the most visible effects of the crisis are\r\novercome, we observe a dangerous attitude of complacency.\r\nThe countries of the region are convinced that a renewed\r\neffort is required in order to strengthen the global financial\r\nsystem, and we reaffirmed our commitment to actively\r\nparticipate in this task.\r\nSecondly, we emphasized the need to have a stable,\r\ntransparent, predictable, organized and secure international\r\nfinancial system. To this end, we, the various participants\r\nmust accept and fulfil our respective responsibilities. The\r\ninternational financial agencies must redesign their policies\r\nin order to respond to the great challenges created by\r\nfinancial markets. They must develop early-warning\r\nmechanisms and expand their resources to help economies\r\nin trouble in a timely and appropriate way. For their part,\r\ncountries must commit themselves to following\r\nmacroeconomic policies that lead to growth and social\r\njustice. They must recognize, in order to remedy the\r\nproblem, the part played in the crisis by the absence of\r\nadequate supervision and regulation of national banking\r\nsystems. A solid banking system is essential to protect a\r\ncountry from speculative movements of capital.\r\nThirdly, we recognized the devastating impact that\r\nfinancial crises have on the social situation and the\r\nprospects for development of our countries. In this respect,\r\nwe expressed the need to advance towards a financial\r\narchitecture that reconciles the economy with society and\r\ninternational finance with sustained social development. We\r\nreaffirmed in this sense our absolute conviction that\r\nsustained growth is the most effective way to reduce\r\ninequality and poverty.\r\nFourthly, we agreed that the ultimate goal of the\r\ninternational development banks must be precisely human\r\ndevelopment. We deemed it fundamental for those\r\ninstitutions to give high priority to financial support for\r\nthe formation of basic networks of social protection in\r\ntimes of crisis, without losing sight of the broader\r\nobjectives of growth and development.\r\nFifthly, we agreed that the United Nations must play\r\na central role in promoting integrated social development\r\nthrough forging an international consensus that helps\r\nsupport and rebuild the global financial architecture. It is\r\nencouraging to learn that in the year 2001 the United\r\nNations will sponsor a high-level meeting on financing\r\ndevelopment. That will be an ideal opportunity to address\r\ncomprehensively the problem of social and human\r\ndevelopment, including its financial aspect.\r\nThus, we will follow up on the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations coming out of the meeting in Mexico,\r\nand on those from other meetings and forums, in order to\r\ninclude all actors in the design of the financial\r\narchitecture for the twenty-first century. We will be\r\nattentive to efforts in this direction on the part of\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe United Nations must strengthen its position and\r\nits mandate as the principal forum of debate and for\r\nseeking consensual solutions that guide the work of the\r\ninternational community in the face of problems and\r\nsituations that affect us all. It is essential to continue the\r\ntask of establishing a more democratic and transparent\r\nOrganization that fully reflects the interests and objectives\r\nof its Members and that is a forum that truly represents\r\nall of them. I am sure that all of us want a United\r\nNations where fairness and justice reign.\r\nLooking towards the Millennium Assembly, we must\r\ncontinue to foster cooperation and closeness among\r\nnations in order to strengthen peace and security, push\r\ndisarmament ahead, promote development and the\r\nstruggle against poverty and ensure full respect for\r\ninternational law.\r\nIf we are really being overtaken by events in the\r\nglobal arena, we must strengthen our frame of action. If\r\nit is necessary to reform our Organization to guarantee its\r\neffective performance, let us do so. But let us do so\r\ncollectively, with respect for the juridical principle of the\r\nequality of States. Let us not allow this forum to lose its\r\nprestige or its influence. Mexico will not retreat from its\r\ncommitment to the letter and the spirit of the San\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nFrancisco Charter. To the contrary, it will participate\r\nactively in the effort to guarantee the vitality of the United\r\nNations in order to build a better world, both for ourselves\r\nand for future generations.\r\nThis is the aim of the proposals I have made on behalf\r\nof the Government that I have the honour to represent.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ali Alatas.\r\nMr. Alatas (Indonesia): On behalf of the Indonesian\r\ndelegation, I should first like to congratulate my colleague\r\nand good friend Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Foreign Minister of\r\nNamibia, on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We are confident that\r\nunder his leadership we will achieve substantial progress in\r\nour work.\r\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, I convey our\r\nsincere appreciation for his able guidance of our work\r\nduring the last session.\r\nI join other members in paying a tribute to our\r\nSecretary-General for his untiring pursuit of the objectives\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Indonesia,\r\nI extend a warm welcome to Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga on\r\ntheir accession to membership of the United Nations. My\r\ndelegation looks forward to working closely with them.\r\nEvery year at this time, for more than a decade now,\r\nI have tried from this rostrum to present Indonesia\u0027s views\r\non the state of world affairs and international relations.\r\nToday, I could deliver last year\u0027s statement, or even that of\r\nthree years ago, and it would not make much difference\r\nbecause there really has been no significant change.\r\nIt is true that there are always a number of positive\r\ndevelopments. This year they include the Sharm el-Sheikh\r\nMemorandum signed by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat\r\nand Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, which raises our\r\nhopes for the resumption of the derailed Middle East peace\r\nprocess. They include also the Lomé Peace Agreement on\r\nSierra Leone; the Framework Agreement on the conflict\r\nbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Ceasefire Agreement on\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, some progress in\r\nthe rehabilitation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the\r\nresolution of the stalemate over the Lockerbie incident.\r\nCloser to home, there have been the signing of the 5 May\r\n1999 Agreements reached in New York and the\r\nimplementation of the historic popular consultation in\r\nEast Timor which — although, most unfortunately, its\r\naftermath was marred by violence — remains an\r\nimportant, positive development. These are all\r\nencouraging steps in a long journey towards just and\r\ndurable solutions.\r\nIn the economic field, investor confidence is\r\nbeginning to trickle back into the Asian economies\r\nseverely hit by the financial and economic crisis. This\r\nreturn of confidence and the positive signs in the affected\r\neconomies — such as stability of currencies and lower\r\ninterest rates — could be the first firm indications of a\r\nrecovery. Recently the G-8 decided to ease the debt\r\nburden of the poorest countries by expanding the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. This will help the\r\npoorest countries get back on the road of development.\r\nBut ours is still an essentially brutal world. In many\r\nplaces, wanton violence and armed conflicts persist, often\r\nbringing about humanitarian disaster. In spite of the\r\npresence of a United Nations peacekeeping force, Serbs\r\nand Albanian Kosovars are still shooting each other in\r\nKosovo. In Afghanistan, dialogue has been abandoned\r\nand once more the warring factions have taken to the\r\nbattlefield. In South Asia, an uneasy ceasefire reigns over\r\nthe line of control between two neighbouring States with\r\nnuclear-weapon capability. Meanwhile, in the backwaters\r\nand slums of the developing world, in the ghettos of the\r\nindustrialized countries, hundreds of millions fight a\r\ndesperate war against poverty, ignorance and disease.\r\nThere has as yet been no fulfilment of a hope we all\r\nshare, a hope to which we have clung for nigh on a\r\ncentury.\r\nA hundred years ago, electricity was just beginning\r\nto light up the cities of the world, the commercial\r\nmanufacture of horseless carriages had just begun and the\r\npioneers of air travel were taking off in crude flying\r\nmachines. But it was beyond question even then that\r\nenormous power called science and technology had been\r\nplaced in the hands of humankind. It was clear even then\r\nthat the prudent use of such power could solve the\r\nproblem of poverty that for millenniums people accepted\r\nand suffered as an inevitable part of the human condition.\r\nSince then, unfortunately, that power has been used\r\ninstead to enlarge humankind\u0027s capacity to kill and\r\ndestroy. That terrible capacity was amply demonstrated in\r\ntwo world wars that levelled cities and decimated\r\npopulations in Europe and Asia. In time of peace, science\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nand technology have made it possible for one part of\r\nhumanity to adopt an irresponsible lifestyle and patterns of\r\nproduction and consumption that ravage the fragile ecology\r\nof this planet while teeming millions, in the squalor of\r\npoverty, driven by the pangs of hunger, are tearing their\r\nenvironment apart in a desperate bid to survive.\r\nFive decades ago, the human race teetered on the\r\nbrink of a nuclear holocaust, but we were able to postpone\r\nthe effective end of history because between us and the\r\nprecipice stood the one shining achievement of humanity in\r\na violent century, the United Nations. Founded in the wake\r\nof the Second World War as a forum for maintaining\r\nsecurity, resolving conflicts and serving development, the\r\nUnited Nations is, whatever its flaws, a masterpiece of\r\nhuman reason.\r\nIt has not achieved its finest promise of global peace,\r\nnor has it significantly curbed poverty. Still, it has managed\r\nto save us from the horrors of yet another world war, one\r\nfought with nuclear weapons. And together with its\r\nspecialized agencies and related institutions, it is carrying\r\nout an immense array of activities in support of economic\r\ndevelopment and social progress; these are touching every\r\naspect of people\u0027s lives all over the world, and thus at least\r\nkeep hopes alive.\r\nBut even the very instrument of our salvation is not\r\nspared our recklessness: the United Nations has been\r\nallowed to go bankrupt at a time when so much more is\r\ndemanded of it as the central mechanism and catalyst for\r\nmultilateral cooperation. Its organs should be working in\r\nharmony and complementing one another: instead, we have\r\nthe spectacle of a Security Council — when not paralysed\r\nby the veto of a permanent member — venturing to take\r\nover the work of other United Nations organs in such fields\r\nas human rights, democracy and humanitarian aid. The\r\nunhappy truth is that the inequities, imbalances and\r\ndiscrimination in international relations that the United\r\nNations was supposed to cure have infected its own vital\r\norgans and processes.\r\nThis is true not only of the United Nations itself but\r\nalso of related multilateral institutions. This is why it has\r\nbeen so difficult to reform, democratize and empower the\r\nUnited Nations, and so difficult to make the membership of\r\nthe Security Council truly reflect the political, economic\r\nand demographic realities of the world today.\r\nAlthough the work of the Council is focused on\r\nconflict situations that are mostly in the developing world,\r\ndeveloping countries are woefully under-represented on\r\nthe Council.\r\nFor the same reason, nuclear disarmament has\r\nachieved no substantial progress in recent years. In fact,\r\nthe nuclear arms race has surged along as countries seek\r\nto join and enjoy the dubious privileges of being nuclear-\r\nweapon States. The world thus remains in danger of\r\nnuclear self-destruction.\r\nThe same situation obtains in multilateral economic\r\nforums. They, too, have become afflicted with the\r\ninequities and imbalances they are meant to rectify. The\r\nintroduction of irrelevant social issues and undue\r\nemphasis on unfettered markets in these forums have\r\nbrought about the neglect of core development issues,\r\nsuch as international cooperation for development, the\r\nneed for non-commercial financial flows and the necessity\r\nof differential treatment for developing countries.\r\nThus, the international agenda has been steered by\r\nthe desire of developed countries to open doors for their\r\nforeign investments, private capital flows and exports.\r\nThis has led to the eclipse of development as a common\r\ngoal and a common responsibility of developed and\r\ndeveloping nations. It has engendered a tendency to forget\r\ncommitments reached at global conferences on\r\nenvironment and development, social development,\r\npopulation and development, women and development,\r\nhabitat and food.\r\nJust over a decade ago, with the barriers of the cold\r\nwar broken down, science and technology unlocked the\r\nawesome force of globalization. This blind force could\r\nhave served as the chief instrument of a united\r\nhumankind in a decisive assault against the global\r\nproblems of poverty and underdevelopment. We could\r\nhave enlisted it to empower people everywhere and thus\r\nbroaden participation in governance and productive\r\ninitiatives. We could have built a more equitable\r\npartnership between the developed and the developing\r\nworld. But at best, the weaker economies were left to the\r\ntender mercies of the market. At worst, globalization has\r\nbeen used by the strong to press their advantage over the\r\nweak, widening the chasm between rich and poor.\r\nAfter all this, what can we say to sum up the\r\npassing of 100 years? If progress means going to the\r\nmoon and exploring outer space; if it means the rapid\r\nmovement of money, goods and people from one\r\ncontinent to another and the delegation of personal\r\ninitiative to clever machines, then we have made some\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nprogress. But if it means the conquest of poverty, the\r\ntaming of the human penchant for conflict and violence,\r\nand ensuring the long-term sustainability of human life, I\r\nam afraid that we may be entering the new millennium not\r\nreally much better off than we were a century ago.\r\nOur tragedy is not in our ignorance, but in the waste\r\nof our wisdom. The truth is that we know the solutions to\r\nour problems. We know what kind of global partnership it\r\nwould take to tackle the problems of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. We have spelled out the global\r\nmeasures to initiate in order to prevent the irreversible\r\ndecay of our environment. And we are aware of what it\r\nwould take to move the disarmament agenda forward; what\r\nkind of representation on the Security Council would make\r\nit a true instrument of the whole international community.\r\nBut we do not make the necessary decisive moves\r\nbecause these require change — profound and radical\r\nchange. There must be change not only in our methods, but\r\nin the way we look at the world, the way we regard one\r\nanother and ourselves. That kind of change brings no\r\ncomfort and poses the deepest challenge to our faith and\r\nour courage. Hence, we hesitate. The protracted debates in\r\nthis Assembly, in the Economic and Social Council, in the\r\nConference on Disarmament and in many other forums are\r\nin reality just one long hesitation.\r\nWe in Indonesia know how difficult that kind of\r\nchange can be. In response to the Asian financial and\r\neconomic crisis, as well as to its social and political impact,\r\nwe have begun to reform our social, economic and political\r\ninstitutions. New laws are being passed, new ways are\r\nbeing tried to give our people the widest opportunity to\r\nparticipate in the making of decisions that affect their lives,\r\nto level the economic playing fields and to earn the\r\nconfidence of our foreign partners.\r\nThe Government has taken a long, hard look at itself\r\nand its responsibilities today. In the case of East Timor, our\r\nresponsibility has changed. Twenty-four years ago, it was\r\nour responsibility to accept the Territory as a province of\r\nour Republic in order to stop ongoing fratricidal carnage\r\nafter a disastrously bungled decolonization process; to\r\naccommodate the desire of the majority of East Timorese\r\nat that time to seek freedom and sanctuary through\r\nintegration with our Republic; and to contribute to the\r\nsecurity and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. We\r\naccepted that responsibility and additional burden, although\r\nwe had never laid claim to that half-island, as it was not a\r\npart of the Dutch East Indies out of which the Indonesian\r\nnation evolved. Today our responsibility and our\r\ncommitment are to help make possible the fulfilment of\r\nthe newly expressed will of the majority of East Timorese\r\nto seek a new destiny outside the Indonesian Republic.\r\nWe will abide by that responsibility and commitment and\r\nat the same time ensure that the parting of ways will\r\nproceed honourably, peacefully and amicably.\r\nIn this process of change, not only in East Timor but\r\nalso throughout our national life and in our relations with\r\nour friends, we have not had an easy time. We have had\r\nmore than our share of setbacks, frustrations and\r\nmistakes. In the depths of every disappointment, we have\r\nhad to summon the courage to persevere, to start all over\r\nagain whenever necessary, because there is no alternative\r\nacceptable to our people. We do pray for the courage to\r\nchange, but not for ourselves alone.\r\nFor the solutions to the global problems of our time\r\ndemand a fortitude on the part of nations that is strong\r\nenough to break the doubts, the prejudices, the sophistry\r\nand the apathy that have hardened with the passing of\r\ndecades. That means the courage to take action where we\r\nhave only paid lip-service. It also means the courage to\r\nrecognize that many of our problems are complex and\r\ndemand more creativity from us than we have so far\r\ndemonstrated.\r\nFor instance, we fully agree that massive and\r\nsystematic violations of human rights, wherever they take\r\nplace, should not be tolerated or condoned. But we cannot\r\nagree that this problem can be solved only by sacrificing\r\nthe principle of national sovereignty and sovereign\r\nequality among nations. There must be a solution that\r\ndoes not threaten to demolish a principle on which the\r\nUnited Nations itself was founded. Let us have the\r\nintellectual courage to look for that solution and be\r\nwilling to make any sacrifice to attain it, except the\r\nsacrifice of our principles.\r\nIf many of us have grown cynical, I believe that it\r\nis not out of arrogance, but out of fear of the\r\nconsequences of change, the loss of some privilege or\r\nadvantage over another, or out of fear of futility and\r\nfailure. We can overcome these fears because they are but\r\nshadows on the wall; they have no substance. There will\r\nbe failures and there will be setbacks, but if what we set\r\nout to do is worthwhile, and nothing is more worthwhile\r\nthan the perpetuation of humankind, we will succeed.\r\nLet us now all act in consonance with our\r\ncommitments to the United Nations Charter; to the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); to\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nAgenda 21; to the Uruguay Round and the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO); to all agreements on international\r\nfinancial flows for development; on cooperation on human\r\nrights; on the eradication of all forms of discrimination. We\r\ncannot bring all of these to fruition in a single day, and\r\nsome of them not even in a full decade, but if we all do\r\nthat today, it will be enough to start with.\r\nIf we keep building on that to achieve something\r\nsignificant, we engender encouragement. We add to the\r\nfund of courage that the world needs to become a better\r\none. And that fund of courage is all it will take for\r\nhumanity to make an auspicious entry into the next\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call on\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ismail Cem.\r\nMr. Cem (Turkey): Mr. President, the session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly over which you are presiding marks the\r\nlast to be held this century. We are about to turn a new leaf\r\nin history. It is, therefore, a time for reflection, a time to\r\nreap our lessons and draw our conclusions. It is also a time\r\nto reorganize our goals, priorities and our agenda for the\r\nnext century.\r\nTherefore, there is a recurrent theme throughout this\r\nsession. We all try to assess what we have achieved and\r\nwhere we have failed in the twentieth century. As we look\r\nback on our performance, we observe that within every\r\nsuccess story, we also somehow had our failures.\r\nThe twentieth century has witnessed unprecedented\r\nscientific progress. These achievements, however, were not\r\nused solely to advance the human cause and to improve the\r\nquality of life. To a very large extent, these scientific and\r\ntechnological innovations were also used as instruments for\r\nthe destruction of life. Throughout the century, there was an\r\nenormous accumulation of wealth. But the vast majority of\r\nthe world\u0027s population is deprived of this wealth. Poverty,\r\nand sometimes even hunger, is still their fate.\r\nThis century has produced great intellectual\r\nachievements and depth. But it has also been the stage of\r\ndistorted ideologies which produced tyrannies and\r\nsometimes encouraged practices like ethnic cleansing. In\r\nother words, while the twentieth century created technology\r\nand generated material and intellectual wealth, it could not\r\norganize the means to put them totally to the service of\r\nhumanity as a whole. This is our failure. This is the\r\nchallenge we face. This is what we must overcome.\r\nThe global issues we face, whether political,\r\neconomic, social or environmental, will from now on\r\nrequire further intensification of our concerted efforts. As\r\nthe primary forum for international cooperation, the\r\nUnited Nations will continue to be the focal point of our\r\ncollective endeavours.\r\nThe wealth of experience accumulated by the United\r\nNations, together with the plans of action devised to\r\naddress the challenges we face, must now be put to more\r\neffective use. The millennium summit next year should\r\nprovide the guidance needed to place our assets to work\r\nmore efficiently in the twenty-first century.\r\nA little over a month ago, one of the deadliest\r\nearthquakes of the century struck the northwest of\r\nTurkey. This is the most populous region of my country.\r\nThe devastating quake claimed more than 15,000 lives,\r\nand thrice as many were wounded. It left about half a\r\nmillion people homeless. We have, undoubtedly, derived\r\ngreat fortitude from the exemplary display of solidarity\r\nand the swift response of the international community.\r\nThe best qualities of human nature were at work: sharing\r\nthe other\u0027s agony and lending a hand to help heal and to\r\nreconstruct.\r\nI would like to convey the gratitude of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Turkey to all Members,\r\nthe international community, the United Nations system,\r\nalong with the numerous volunteers and individuals who\r\nstood with us at our most trying hour.\r\nWe express our deep feelings of sympathy for and\r\nsolidarity with those affected by the earthquake near\r\nTaipei. In the face of the recent wave of earthquakes, we\r\nbelieve this Organization can take a further step with\r\nregard to natural disasters. This would be in keeping with\r\nthe greater role of the United Nations in our lives. That\r\nis why my country, together with our neighbour Greece,\r\nwhich also suffered a similar calamity recently, is\r\nintroducing a draft resolution to the General Assembly.\r\nThis was eloquently announced by my Greek counterpart,\r\nGeorge Papandreou, yesterday in the General Assembly.\r\nWe hope that it will receive Members\u0027 support.\r\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, Turkey looks\r\nforward to enhancing its contribution to international\r\npeace and stability. At the epicentre of Eurasia, it aspires\r\nto broaden the scope of cooperation and prosperity, while\r\nit continues in its traditional role of connecting continents\r\nand civilizations.\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nMore specifically, Turkey is actively involved in the\r\nefforts to secure peace and stability in the Balkans, the\r\nMiddle East, the southern Caucasus region and Central\r\nAsia. We also partake in their democratic and economic\r\ndevelopment efforts. Turkey enjoys the vast potential of\r\nhistorical and cultural affinities with many of the countries\r\nin the Caucasus region and Central Asia. We will work for\r\nthe resolution of the various conflicts in the region and\r\ncontinue to foster ever closer relations with all of them.\r\nCooperation can rapidly lead the peoples of this region\r\nto higher levels of wealth and prosperity. Central Asia will\r\ncertainly witness tremendous economic development, given\r\nits rich human and natural resources. Turkey, lying at the\r\nhub, will become an energy terminal, connecting in more\r\nways than one, the wealth and resources of Eurasia. We see\r\nthe mega-projects of the next century realized in our\r\ncountry and our region.\r\nWe are committed to the vision of a peaceful,\r\ndemocratic, and prosperous future in south-eastern Europe.\r\nWe will continue to bring forth our resources and\r\ncontributions to that end. The need for a large-scale and\r\nlong-term stabilization and reconstruction programme for\r\nthe entire region, and more urgently for Kosovo, is evident.\r\nWe therefore welcome the stability pact for South-Eastern\r\nEurope. In this context, it is important that the agreements\r\nand arrangements on Kosovo are fully implemented, along\r\nwith the continuation of support and assistance to Albania\r\nand Macedonia.\r\nAs the wounds of the Bosnian tragedy are yet to be\r\nhealed, the provisions of the Dayton Peace Agreement must\r\nbe strictly observed and implemented.\r\nThe tragedies in the Balkans have taught us to be\r\nabsolutely cautious and balanced in addressing conflict,\r\nwhether ethnic or otherwise. We do not have the luxury of\r\nacting upon selective memory or one-sided preferences. We\r\ncannot afford to impose solutions that do not correspond to\r\nthe realities and to the aspirations of the peoples concerned.\r\nA case in point is Cyprus. Until 1974 the Turkish\r\nCypriots suffered a great deal in protecting their legitimate\r\nrights and interests. There can be no return to those dark\r\ndays. A just and lasting compromise in Cyprus today can\r\nonly be based upon the existing realities. There are two\r\nseparate peoples, two separate States in Cyprus. These two\r\nStates should be able to solve their differences through their\r\nown free will. In the meantime, there could be steps to\r\nimprove the atmosphere between the two sides by lifting\r\nthe unjust embargo on the Turkish Cypriots and by also\r\nadopting deconfrontational measures, as proposed by the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General.\r\nOn our part, we believe that the confederation\r\nproposal provides the basis for a realistic and viable\r\nsettlement in Cyprus.\r\nWe are encouraged by the recent developments in\r\nthe Middle East peace process. Once mutual tolerance and\r\nunderstanding start to fully reign over this region, we\r\nbelieve all nations will display fully their historic\r\neconomic capabilities and their wisdom. My country will\r\ncontinue to actively support the aim of reaching lasting\r\npeace and security in the Middle East.\r\nFollowing an exchange of letters with my Greek\r\ncounterpart, George Papandreou, about three months ago,\r\nour two countries, Turkey and Greece, initiated joint\r\ncommittees to work on specific issues. Since then high-\r\nranking officials of the Foreign Ministries held two\r\nrounds of meetings and explored the possibilities of\r\npromoting cooperation. Committees were mandated in the\r\nfields of tourism, environment, trade, culture, regional\r\ncooperation and the fight against organized crime, illegal\r\nimmigration, drug trafficking and terrorism.\r\nBoth sides are agreed that there is scope for further\r\ncooperation in these fields and identified specific projects\r\nto this end. Turkey has the will to carry this process to\r\nother spheres of our relationship. Following the\r\nearthquakes that struck the two countries, the emotions\r\nand solidarity displayed by the Turkish and Greek peoples\r\ndemonstrate that the two peoples will not accept\r\nconfrontation and tension as a way of life, and that they\r\nprefer friendship. This powerful message of our peoples\r\nwill help our Governments to move forward with greater\r\nconfidence.\r\nTurkey will this year host the last summit of the\r\ncentury. The Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (OSCE) summit to be held in Istanbul in\r\nNovember will set the stage for important decisions. The\r\noutcome will play a significant role in shaping the future\r\nsecurity and cooperation architecture in the Eurasian\r\nlandscape.\r\nOur political resolve to promote peace and stability\r\nover such a wide horizon is on record. Given the\r\nopportunity, we are prepared to take upon ourselves even\r\ngreater responsibilities.\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nTurkey has presented its candidature for membership\r\non the United Nations Security Council for 2001-2002. We\r\nwant to contribute to the making of the next millennium as\r\na member of the Council. We ask for Members\u0027 support.\r\nThe compelling lesson to be drawn from the twentieth\r\ncentury is that our highest priority should be the protection\r\nof the dignity of humankind and the enhancement of the\r\nquality of life. Whether it is to halt aggression, to stop\r\ncrimes against humanity, to purge societies of racist and\r\nxenophobic tendencies, of cultural and religious intolerance,\r\nto combat international terrorism, to provide humanitarian\r\nassistance, to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor\r\nor to secure sustainable economic and social development,\r\nwe should act as an international coalition — that is, as the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLet us make the twenty-first century the new age of\r\nnations united for a more humane and prosperous era for\r\nall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call\r\non the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Romania, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Andrei Gabriel Plesu.\r\nMr. Plesu (Romania): I am greatly pleased to extend\r\nmy warmest congratulations to our newly elected President\r\nof the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Also,\r\nI join previous speakers in expressing our debt of gratitude\r\nto the outgoing President, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his able\r\nstewardship of the proceedings of the Assembly during the\r\npast session.\r\nI welcome the newcomers to the United Nations\r\nfamily, Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga.\r\nIt has not been an easy year for our Secretary-General.\r\nWe all appreciate his wisdom and sense of balance in\r\nsteering the reform process of the United Nations itself with\r\na firm hand at a time of profound change on the\r\ninternational scene.\r\nWhether we like it or not, globalization is upon us. A\r\nsatisfactory definition of the term may not be yet available,\r\nbut we all feel the effects of it: pervasive; subtle or less so;\r\ndisturbing; sometimes perverse; and, above all, challenging.\r\nThe end of a millennium and the advent of a new one\r\nis a good time for reflection. It is not just coping with the\r\nmillennium bug, which may cause our computers to go\r\nawry; it is — to use the Secretary General\u0027s well polished\r\nphrase — a “symbolically compelling moment”. It is not\r\nfor me to answer the question of where we are and where\r\nwe are heading: the collective wisdom of the United\r\nNations Member States, assisted by academia and, we\r\nhope, by civil society too, will take charge of that at the\r\nmillennium summit next year. I think we must take that\r\nevent seriously: although we may have a lot to celebrate,\r\nwe still have a lot more to do, earnestly, pragmatically\r\nand effectively.\r\nLike all good things, globalization produces\r\nbeneficial effects; then again, as happens with most good\r\nthings, those benefits are not evenly distributed: those\r\nwho are better equipped to face the challenge of going\r\nglobal will reap its fruits sooner, while those who are not\r\nwill have to try harder. What I mean is that as we talk\r\nabout globalization we do not have to indulge ourselves\r\nin slogans or idolatry: globalization involves great\r\nbenefits, but also great risks. We should not forget that\r\nour century first experienced the dark side of\r\nglobalization: world war. Luckily, it is also\r\nglobalization — this time in its good sense — that can\r\nmake it impossible for conflicts to become chronic,\r\nbecause the whole world instantly learns about any local\r\ndispute and mobilizes all available energies to identify\r\nand implement solutions.\r\nThe moral underpinning of globalization is called\r\nsolidarity. One could say that in its very structures and\r\ngoals the United Nations anticipated contemporary\r\nglobalization: the United Nations is all about\r\ninstitutionalized solidarity, and to belong to this\r\nOrganization means making solidarity the norm of best\r\nconduct. Social, political and economic solidarity;\r\ncultural, inter-ethnic and regional solidarity; solidarity\r\nborn out of respect for values, and fostered by goodwill\r\nand good faith — these are the ethics that we wish for the\r\nforthcoming millennium.\r\nIt should be clear that the individual must\r\nnecessarily be the beneficiary of any form of solidarity:\r\ninternational organizations, States and governments do not\r\nacquire legitimacy and cannot be judged otherwise than\r\nthrough their impact on individual destiny. The real man\r\nor woman, rather than generic mankind, and the values\r\nembodied by the human species, rather than self-serving\r\nprojects, are the true subjects of politics.\r\nThis way of thinking has lately brought up the issue\r\nof humanitarian intervention, human rights and reform of\r\nthe system of international law. This is a sensitive issue\r\nand one full of pitfalls. There are those who say that we\r\nshould not tolerate legal injustice under the pretext of\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nhumanitarian intervention. That is true. Similarly, some say\r\nthat we should tolerate either social injustice nor crime\r\nunder the pretext of non-interference in domestic affairs.\r\nUndoubtedly respect for human rights is primarily the\r\nresponsibility of national Governments and State\r\ninstitutions. However, if they do not fulfil this task, there\r\nshould be an instrument capable of enforcing respect for\r\ninternational standards and there is no better instrument for\r\ndoing so than the United Nations.\r\nPreventing conflicts is a complex undertaking.\r\nUnfortunately, we do not always have time to act subtly\r\nand imaginatively. We are not doing enough in the field of\r\neducation in the sense of cultivating values of respect for\r\nthe integrity of the individual and for his or her right to be\r\ndifferent. We do not always understand in time that the\r\nmost efficient way to fight war and violence is to fight\r\npoverty. We do not always know how to distinguish\r\nbetween political manoeuvring and public interest, between\r\nnational pride and universally valid principles. We must\r\nreflect on these things not only when crises are unleashed\r\nbut instantly calmly and clear-mindedly. There is no simple\r\nway of coping with complexity. It requires vision,\r\nenlightened foresight, careful planning and hard work.\r\nThe revolutionary changes of ten years ago in Central\r\nand Eastern Europe and the ensuing process of transition\r\nwere essentially focused on values — political pluralism,\r\nparliamentary democracy, separation of powers, individual\r\nfreedom, market economy and human rights, including the\r\nrights of people belonging to ethnic, religious or other\r\nminorities. Those values prevailed because they were right,\r\nbecause they survived in our hearts and minds through\r\ndecades of totalitarian communist oppression, and because\r\nthey were embraced by the vast majority of people in our\r\ncountries.\r\nBut shared values themselves are not enough to build\r\na truly prosperous democratic society: they have to be\r\nunderpinned by an equally coherent set of institutions\r\ndesigned to serve and actually implement those values. The\r\ntwo — values and institutions — are inextricably linked in\r\na functioning democracy, and it is precisely from this\r\nlinkage that the indispensable ingredient for further progress\r\narises: leadership. That, in a nutshell, is the substance of\r\ngood governance. We are reminded here of the idea that:\r\n“The important thing for government is not to do\r\nthings which individuals are doing already, and to do\r\nthem a little bit better or a little bit worse, but to do\r\nthose things which at present are not done at all.”\r\n[John Maynard Keynes, “The End of Laissez-Faire”]\r\nWe in Romania, much like those in many other Central\r\nand East European countries, have been and still are\r\nlearning that simple truth the hard way in a difficult and\r\nsometimes painful process of transition.\r\nIt is in that spirit and in recognition of the\r\ninternational dimension of good governance at a time of\r\nglobal change that the Romanian delegation has submitted\r\na draft code of democratic conduct (A/54/178, annex) for\r\nexamination by the Assembly this session. The text before\r\nthe Assembly is the result of extensive consultations and\r\nincludes meaningful contributions from many quarters\r\nbased upon the original framework from the Conferences\r\nof New or Restored Democracies. The important — and\r\nI would say, novel — thing about this document is that,\r\nin addition to listing principles and stating general aims,\r\nit also spells out practical modalities for carrying them\r\nout in the political, legal, administrative, economic and\r\nsocial spheres. Last but not least, it emphasizes the crucial\r\nrole of non-institutional players — business communities,\r\nunions, non-governmental organizations, civil society, the\r\nmedia — in shaping policies and in building consensus\r\nfor implementation.\r\nIn a changing world, the world Organization itself is\r\nalso changing. The scope and pace of its reform and\r\nadaptation to the new realities and requirements may have\r\nbeen uneven, patchy in some respects and even\r\ndisappointing, but the process has gained momentum and\r\nthere are hopeful signs for steady progress in the future.\r\nThe United Nations is uniquely equipped by its structure\r\nand acquired expertise to seek specific rather than\r\nstandard solutions to specific problems. Every crisis we\r\nhave had to face in recent years and months had a\r\nphysiognomy of its own. To be effective, the response\r\nmust match the challenge in terms of innovative\r\ncomplexity.\r\nIn relation to the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil membership and its improved performance, we\r\nbelieve that proper consideration should be given to the\r\ninterests of all regional groups, including the Group of\r\nEastern European States, which has seen the most\r\nspectacular rise in numbers over the past three decades.\r\nRomania welcomed the initiative to create the United\r\nNations Stand-by Forces High-Readiness Brigade and\r\ntakes part in it. Recent events across the world have\r\ndemonstrated the urgent need to make it operational as\r\nsoon as possible. We have been reminded of this in a\r\nmost dramatic fashion by the recent events in East Timor.\r\nRomanian contingents took part in several United\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nNations-led and other peacekeeping, peace support and\r\npolicing operations and are further prepared to improve and\r\ndiversify their contribution to such activities.\r\nOur cooperation with the United Nations agencies has\r\nbecome better focused and more effective. I should like to\r\nmention the importance we attach to the support of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme in designing and\r\nmanaging specific, high-priority projects for Romania,\r\nnotably in public administration, in the preparation of a\r\nnational strategy for sustainable development and of a local\r\nAgenda 21 programme. Further useful work is expected to\r\nbe done jointly with the World Bank for the formulation of\r\na comprehensive development framework at both the\r\nnational and the regional level.\r\nThe Balkan tragedy has been in the headlines for the\r\nwhole of this past year. We all had an object lesson on the\r\nharm that ethnic and religious intolerance compounded by\r\nrabid nationalism can do to an entire region. As so many\r\ntimes in history, it was the innocents that had to suffer\r\nmost, individuals and nations alike. But we have also\r\nlearned that determination and prompt action by the\r\ninternational community can make a difference. It is\r\ngratifying to note that trans-Atlantic solidarity again passed\r\na crucial test in these past few months. In fact, if we are\r\nable to look into the future of the region with a reasonable\r\ndegree of optimism, it is because we have seen concerted\r\naction at work.\r\nThe Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe is such\r\nproof of a new, bold approach — a comprehensive, forward\r\nlooking programme which proposes to deal with the entire\r\nregion with specific action envisaged on three tiers:\r\ninternational security, economic development and\r\ndemocracy and institution-building. Romania has welcomed\r\nthe plan from the very beginning, is part of it and seriously\r\nmeans to do its utmost to bring it to fruition. It is still\r\nearly, but three preliminary observations may be in order.\r\nFirst, the actual participation of the countries in the\r\nregion and of its immediate neighbours, such as Romania,\r\nis crucial for its success.\r\nSecondly, in focusing on the eventual integration of\r\nthe region as a whole into the European and Atlantic\r\nstructures, the sequence and content of the steps to be taken\r\nshould realistically differentiate among the actual\r\nrequirements and capabilities of each participating country.\r\nThirdly, besides action at the governmental level, it is\r\nvital to secure the active involvement of business interests\r\nand the various organizational expressions of civil society\r\nin order to give substance and continuity to the whole\r\nprocess.\r\nAlmost as an afterthought, I think I should also\r\nmention the need for a watchful eye on transparency,\r\napplying equally to political decision-making and to\r\nprocurement procedures, including those practised by the\r\nagencies of the United Nations family. This is a\r\nlegitimately sensitive subject for the countries of the\r\nregion, particularly for the companies registered there, and\r\nought to be duly considered as such.\r\nRomania\u0027s commitment to its strategic goals of\r\nEuropean and Atlantic integration is steady and\r\nunwavering. It has passed the acid test of the Kosovo\r\ncrisis. We are looking forward with confidence and hope\r\nto the major decisions which are due to be taken before\r\nthe year\u0027s end and thereafter.\r\nThe United Nations may not be perfect, but is\r\nperfectible and, after all, is the only world forum\r\navailable. It is up to us to make it live and deliver. We,\r\nthe Member States, have to deliver in order to live in a\r\npeaceful world. For this I hope and pray.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Aleksandar Dimitrov.\r\nMr. Dimitrov (the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): Allow me first of all to congratulate\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Republic of Namibia, for having been elected\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. At the same time, I would like to express my\r\nappreciation of and respect for the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session, Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti, for the results achieved during his presidency.\r\nLet me also express my deep respect for Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, for his excellent leadership of the\r\nOrganization. I wish to assure him that the Republic of\r\nMacedonia is ready to continue to closely cooperate with\r\nhim.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia welcomes the admission\r\nof the new Members — the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga — and\r\nwishes them success in their contribution to United\r\nNations activities, and at the same time expresses its\r\n41\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nreadiness to establish diplomatic relations with them. Also,\r\nI hope that we shall continue the process of establishing\r\ndiplomatic relations between the Republic of Macedonia —\r\nof course, using the constitutional name — and Member\r\nStates with which we have not yet done so.\r\nOn this occasion, I would like to express my deepest\r\ncondolences to the people of Taiwan on the earthquake that\r\nhit the Republic of China on Taiwan, with which the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia has recently established diplomatic\r\nrelations.\r\nIt is with regret that we have to note that one of the\r\nmain characteristics of the past year was flagrant and highly\r\nrisky disrespect for the fundamental values of democratic\r\nsociety. In addition to the major tragedies the world was\r\nfaced with, we witnessed a growing trend of armed\r\nconflicts and internal and external tensions. Concerning the\r\narea surrounding the Republic of Macedonia, I would focus\r\non the huge humanitarian crisis that took place in South-\r\nEastern Europe and the heavy consequences which\r\njeopardized the stability and security of the Balkans and\r\nbeyond in Europe.\r\nThe Kosovo crisis had particularly adverse effects on\r\nmy country. We had to cope with an enormous influx of\r\nrefugees, numbering more than 360,000, or 18 per cent of\r\nthe total population. The Republic of Macedonia entered a\r\nrather difficult economic, social and political situation that\r\ntended to destabilize it, particularly against the background\r\nthat the international community reacted with insufficient\r\nspeed and agility. The damage which the Macedonian\r\neconomy suffered is enormous, amounting to approximately\r\n$660 million. A large number of workers were dismissed as\r\na result of lost markets and increased transportation costs.\r\nThe unemployment rate reached 40 per cent. All of this has\r\nnegatively affected the already poor economic and social\r\nsituation. In these circumstances, the citizens of the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia have demonstrated great\r\nhumaneness towards the refugees, tolerance and solidarity,\r\nbut also restraint in the conditions of enormous social,\r\npolitical and economic pressure they were exposed to and\r\nwhose consequences could have been more dramatic.\r\nFinally, we should not forget that there are still 30,000\r\nrefugees in the Republic of Macedonia. I urge the\r\nAssembly to continue the joint efforts for their safe return\r\nto their homes.\r\nAt the same time, the peace forces of the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for Kosovo were\r\ndeployed in the Republic of Macedonia in support of the\r\ninternational efforts for a political resolution of the crisis,\r\nas were a large number of international governmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nMacedonia has managed to overcome these\r\nhardships, but the consequences are still being felt in the\r\nnational economy. Financial assistance and support from\r\nthe international community are indispensable for the\r\nrecovery of the national economy. It is beyond doubt that\r\ncompensation for the damage we suffered by making our\r\nnational capacities available for the resolution of the\r\nKosovo crisis should be an obligation of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Macedonian Government highly appreciates the\r\nassistance provided by the international community thus\r\nfar through certain financial institutions or on a bilateral\r\nbasis. The assistance should continue, which is to say, we\r\nexpect States to fully carry out the commitments they\r\nhave undertaken. This is the right moment to write off\r\nparts of our external debts as a recognition of the efforts\r\nwe are making to overcome the crisis. Today, the only\r\nthing that the Republic of Macedonia requests is the\r\nfulfilment of the promises made by the international\r\ncommunity during the crisis.\r\nEven prior to the outbreak of the crisis and the\r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), my\r\ncountry had consistently supported a peaceful and\r\npolitical solution to the Kosovo crisis that would include\r\nsubstantial autonomy within the framework of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia; respect for the human rights of\r\nall living in Kosovo; respect for the inviolability of\r\nexisting borders; the cessation of hostilities and of\r\nrepression; the deployment of peace forces; the safe and\r\nfree return of refugees; the demilitarization of the Kosovo\r\nLiberation Army (KLA) and other paramilitary forces;\r\nand the economic reconstruction of Kosovo and the\r\nregion.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to commend the\r\nefforts made fully to implement Security Council\r\nresolution 1244 (1999). The Republic of Macedonia, in\r\nthis respect, will continue to support the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the\r\nEuropean Union, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and all\r\nother international governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations. In this context, I would like to recall that\r\non many occasions the Macedonian Government has\r\ndemonstrated its readiness closely to cooperate with the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, with his Special\r\n42\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nRepresentative, Mr. Kouchner, and with UNMIK, and that\r\nit has offered its good offices.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia strongly supports the\r\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe as one of the most\r\nimportant adopted documents for the wider region and for\r\nEurope. Furthermore, it is prepared to take an active part in\r\nits implementation and to contribute to the reconstruction\r\nand stabilization of the region and its speedy integration\r\ninto European structures. The Stability Pact, through its\r\nthree pillars, or “working tables”, and through the relevant\r\ninternational global and regional institutions, is expected to\r\ncontribute to a lasting stabilization of the region and to its\r\nfinal integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures.\r\nTo this effect, I would like to call upon all of the parties to\r\nthis extremely important document to mutually reinforce\r\ntheir activities and to enhance their coordination.\r\nI would here like to underscore the strong interest of\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia in the prompt implementation\r\nof the second pillar for economic development and\r\nreconstruction. The most important issue linked with its\r\nunimpeded functioning and the realization of the desired\r\nresults — greater inclusion of the Balkans in European\r\neconomic, political and democratic trends — is the setting\r\nup of lasting mechanisms for the necessary fund-raising and\r\nthe securing of funds to this end. Many United Nations\r\nprogrammes and activities could be used for this purpose.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is interested in seeing the\r\nUnited Nations play a role in this sphere.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia will propose a pertinent\r\ndraft resolution at this session of the General Assembly that\r\nstresses the importance of the prompt consolidation and\r\ndevelopment of South-Eastern Europe, the importance of\r\nthe Stability Pact and the need for the full implementation\r\nof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). We are\r\nconvinced that the draft will be supported by all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nLet us hope that this will be the last crisis in the\r\nBalkans or South-Eastern Europe. But to prevent any\r\nrecurrence of this kind of situation, we will have to defend\r\nmore successfully democratic principles and values and\r\ndevelop long-term preventive strategies.\r\nI am convinced that the beginning of the next\r\nmillennium will mark a new era in the history of this area,\r\nwhich has been overburdened with conflicts and therefore\r\nneeds to focus primarily on its own development and\r\nprosperity. In the long run, regional stability can be\r\nprovided by economic development, democracy, respect of\r\nhuman rights and the rights of national minorities, and\r\nbilateral and regional cooperation. However, the best way\r\nto guarantee the security of the region and transform it\r\ninto an area of democracy, development, stability and\r\ncooperation is for the countries of the region to join the\r\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) and become fully fledged members.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is among the countries\r\nmost affected by the crisis — economically, socially and\r\npolitically. This has hampered our efforts to build a\r\nsociety that meets the expectations of our people.\r\nDespite the major challenges it has confronted in the\r\npast, my country has managed to implement and advance\r\nthe strategic commitments set out in its foreign policy:\r\nintegration in the European Union, inclusion in\r\nEuro-Atlantic security structures and development of\r\ngood-neighbourliness.\r\nThe success of that policy is reflected in the fact that\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia was able to stay out of the\r\nfour armed conflicts which have taken place in the last\r\ndecade on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. For the\r\nfirst time in the history of the Republic of Macedonia as\r\nan independent country, we have been faced with a war\r\non our borders. In such circumstances, the contribution of\r\nthe peaceful and constructive Macedonian policy to\r\nconflict resolution is highly significant. The Republic of\r\nMacedonia is fully committed to carrying out the reforms\r\nthat have been initiated, based on European standards, in\r\nthe political, economic and democracy fields, with\r\nmaximum respect for human rights, including minority\r\nrights.\r\nThat commitment by the Macedonian Government\r\nand the results of the reforms have been commended by\r\nthe international community. That is precisely why the\r\nEuropean Union has decided that the Republic of\r\nMacedonia should be the first partner in the\r\ncommencement of negotiations for the conclusion of the\r\nStability and Association Agreement.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia has a long-term\r\ncommitment to the continuing improvement of its\r\nrelations with all of its neighbours. The advancement and\r\ndevelopment of these relations, as well as of bilateral\r\ncooperation with all of its neighbours, is evidenced by\r\nintensive cooperation in the framework of a number of\r\nregional initiatives. Two trilateral meetings have taken\r\nplace among the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of\r\nMacedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece, the aim of\r\n43\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nwhich was to coordinate and promote activities aimed at a\r\nmore successful implementation of the Stability Pact.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the policy of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Macedonia, elected less\r\nthan a year ago, is aimed in particular at improving, as\r\nsoon as possible, the situation in the region. To this effect,\r\nmany practical steps have been taken, which to our mutual\r\nsatisfaction are yielding results.\r\nAs we approach the new millennium, the last session\r\nof the General Assembly for this century is undoubtedly the\r\nforum best suited to evaluating what has been achieved in\r\nthe area of the promotion and protection of human rights\r\nand freedoms. Over the last 50 years, impressive progress\r\nhas been made in international humanitarian law. Today, we\r\nare proud to note that the United Nations, having adopted\r\nthe fundamental Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\r\nhas managed to affirm the international consensus on the\r\nbasic postulates of human dignity and to promote them as\r\na basic standard and objective to be attained by all\r\nindividuals and nations.\r\nOf no less importance is the promotion and\r\nstrengthening of all United Nations human rights bodies\r\nengaged in the protection and promotion of human rights,\r\nincluding minority rights. In this regard, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia supports the reform of the mechanisms and\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations bodies in this area.\r\nThis year we mark the tenth anniversary of the\r\nadoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nAlthough this Convention has been ratified by almost all\r\nStates, its genuine implementation is still a desired aim. A\r\nlarge number of children are still victims of disrespect for\r\ntheir fundamental rights. We therefore fully and firmly\r\nsupport the efforts made at this year\u0027s session of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights to undertake concrete\r\nmeasures for the protection of the rights of the child, the\r\naim of which is to promote the next century as the century\r\nof the universal protection of the rights of the child.\r\nThe role and efforts of the international community in\r\nthe full implementation of currently accepted standards and\r\nprinciples are important, but the primary role and\r\nresponsibility lies with the States themselves. As is evident\r\nfrom the democratic development of my country, the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia completely associates itself with the\r\nendeavours of the international community for the\r\nobservance and promotion of human rights.\r\nIn the twenty-first century the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security all over the world should\r\nbe the priority aim of our Organization. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral stated in his report, the world, and our\r\nOrganization in particular, will be faced with the need to\r\nbe fully involved in the prevention and peaceful\r\nresolution of conflicts and with the development of the\r\naffected States. The elimination of poverty and reducing\r\nthe gap between the developed and developing countries\r\nshould be our priorities, as my colleagues have already\r\nsaid. In the next century the Republic of Macedonia\r\nwould like to see an improvement in economic\r\ndevelopment and international economic cooperation, as\r\nwell as an enhancement of efforts being made within the\r\ndisarmament process and greater support for them.\r\nWe may note that the global community has\r\nachieved significant improvements with regard to living\r\nstandards and the reduction of poverty. The global\r\neconomy is showing modest but constant growth of 2 per\r\ncent annually, while the volume of trade is continuing to\r\nincrease. However, it seems that, irrespective of the\r\nimportant accomplishments, the world community is\r\nconfronted with a series of alarming problems that must\r\nbe resolved.\r\nIncreased world poverty and unemployment are key\r\nproblems, which should be the main preoccupation of the\r\ninternational community, the aim being to eliminate them.\r\nHalf the population of the world lives on less than $3 per\r\ncapita per day, while the unemployment rate is increasing\r\ncontinuously; the international community has to face the\r\nchallenge of overcoming that situation. Decisions of the\r\ninternational community regarding international economic\r\npolicies are most frequently made in the United Nations\r\nframework. The Governments of the developed countries\r\nhave a leading role to play and the primary responsibility\r\nin this domain.\r\nThe indebtedness of the developing countries and\r\ncountries in transition is mainly a result of inappropriate\r\npolitical circumstances, in the form of armed conflicts;\r\ndifferent types of embargoes and factors make it\r\nimpossible for them to market their goods; and natural\r\ndisasters. Writing off the debts, or part of the debts, of\r\nthe countries affected by objective external factors would\r\nhave a very positive impact on diminishing global poverty\r\nand unemployment and on economic development. Only\r\nthe economically developed and independent State can be\r\ntruly politically independent and sovereign and have a\r\nrole to play in the international community.\r\n44\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nGlobalization of the world economy and liberalization\r\nof world trade are necessary preconditions for the\r\nimprovement of living standards and the reduction of\r\nexisting differences in countries\u0027 development relative to\r\nglobal development. The role of the United Nations in this\r\narea is of great importance. The increased globalization and\r\nliberalization of the world economy should be accompanied\r\nby a lowering of existing barriers and by facilitating the\r\nfree transfer of goods and services and of the work force.\r\nThis would create a unified world economy in its true\r\nmeaning.\r\nIn the next century more attention will be placed on\r\nthe observance of the United Nations Charter. In the\r\ninterests of the maintenance of international peace and\r\ncollective security, it is extremely important that Security\r\nCouncil decisions be made on behalf of all the Member\r\nStates of our Organization, without its being possible for\r\nthem to abuse the right of veto. The contribution of the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia to the promotion of peace and\r\nsecurity is well known, and this was confirmed by the\r\ndeployment on its territory of the United Nations Preventive\r\nDeployment Force (UNPREDEP), which was unfortunately\r\nterminated at the moment when the region may have been\r\nmost in need of it.\r\nThe importance of the leading role played by this\r\nsingle universal Organization is reflected in its skill in\r\nadapting to real situations and practical problems. I am\r\ndeeply convinced that the new challenges are already\r\nreflected in the manner of operation of our Organization\r\nand in its structure. I would like to salute the firm\r\ndetermination to continue to implement United Nations\r\nreforms, which have already produced results, as stated in\r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s report. The Republic of Macedonia\r\nis of the opinion that the reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem will be successful only if reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is followed by reform of the General Assembly and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\nWe expect the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly to successfully conclude preparations for the\r\norganization of the Millennium Assembly in the year 2000.\r\nIn this context, we are anticipating with great interest the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report. At the same time, we join the\r\nappeal for all Member States to be represented by heads of\r\nState or Government at that event.\r\nUnited Nations Member States must constantly\r\ncontribute to the strengthening of the basic democratic\r\nvalues of peace, security, stability, social and economic\r\ndevelopment, respect for international law and respect for\r\nhuman and minority rights. The United Nations is the true\r\nplace for the improvement of these basic values. The\r\nresolution of each country to persist in that way is of\r\ncrucial importance in determining whether we will jointly\r\nmanage to fully implement these commitments and enjoy\r\nthe fruits of development.\r\nI would like to assure the Assembly that the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia has already embarked on that road\r\nand will continue to make its contribution to the full\r\nimplementation of those values.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nI remind members that, in accordance with decision\r\n34/401, statements in exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five\r\nminutes for the second, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I wish to\r\nrespond to the distortion of facts in the statement of the\r\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait. First of\r\nall, he spoke of the imposition of sanctions as a\r\nsuccessful way to settle issues. We believe that the\r\nsanctions against Libya and against Iraq have resulted in\r\nhumanitarian disasters. The Kuwaiti minister ought to\r\nread the latest report prepared by the United Nations\r\nChildren\u0027s Fund (UNICEF), which shows that to date\r\n500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five have died as\r\na result of the sanctions. He has forgotten the\r\ninternational condemnation of those sanctions; he has also\r\nforgotten the view of the present Secretary-General and\r\nhis predecessor that experience has shown sanctions to be\r\na limited weapon that sometimes misses its target and\r\ncauses disastrous harm to civilians.\r\nThe sanctions against Iraq constitute a crime of\r\ngenocide. If the Kuwaiti minister believes that this is why\r\nthe sanctions are successful, then he is correct.\r\nSecondly, the Kuwaiti minister summarized in his\r\nown way the conclusions reached by Ambassador\r\nAmorim. No matter what we may think of those reports,\r\nthe conclusions of the Kuwaiti minister were presented in\r\nthe style of the United States: in an excessively selective\r\nway. He ignored the well known fact that the former\r\nUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was a\r\n45\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\ntool used for spying on Iraq on behalf of the United States\r\nof America, the zionist entity and the United Kingdom. The\r\nfact that UNSCOM itself destroyed documents as well as\r\nsamples of the VX it had used to contaminate missiles in\r\nIraq proves the Commission\u0027s lack of professionalism.\r\nUNSCOM was a black mark on the history of the United\r\nNations and an affront to its role in the field of verification.\r\nIn a recent report, the Secretary-General himself confirmed\r\nthat reports of spying by UNSCOM were, to some extent,\r\ntrue.\r\nThere must be no false statements based on false\r\naccusations: all the conclusions of UNSCOM are mere lies\r\nintended to perpetuate the sanctions against Iraq.\r\nThirdly, the matter of missing Kuwaitis is a\r\nhumanitarian issue that Kuwait has been exploiting for its\r\nown cheap political purposes. The existence of missing\r\npersons is one of the negative consequences of any conflict.\r\nThere are 600 missing Kuwaitis, and more than 1,000\r\nmissing Iraqis. We call upon Kuwait to cooperate regarding\r\nthe fate of missing Iraqis.\r\nFourthly, we take note of Kuwait\u0027s support for the\r\ndraft resolution put forward by the Netherlands and the\r\nUnited Kingdom. That is no surprise to us, and we affirm\r\nto the Kuwaiti minister and to others that it is high time for\r\nlifting the sanctions against Iraq, for halting interference in\r\nits internal affairs, and for putting an end to the aggression\r\nagainst it. If the minister really wants to achieve security\r\nand stability in the region, he must end Kuwait\u0027s\r\nparticipation in the daily aggression against Iraq in the no-\r\nfly zones. Daily aggression by the United States and the\r\nUnited Kingdom in the no-fly zones constitutes use of force\r\nagainst an independent State without Security Council\r\nauthorization. That is a substantive violation of the Charter,\r\nof international law, and of Security Council resolutions\r\ncalling for respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty\r\nand independence of Iraq.\r\nBecause of its participation in the no-fly zones,\r\nKuwait should be the last to speak of the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nMr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I regret\r\nthat at this late hour I must exercise my right to reply to\r\nthe statement of the representative of Iraq, and I shall try to\r\nbe brief. First of all, I fully reaffirm what my Minister of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs said in his statement earlier today.\r\nSecondly, with respect to the comments made by the\r\nrepresentative of Iraq about the various negative aspects\r\nand results of the sanctions, we do not differ with him\r\nconcerning the impact of the sanctions. But such sanctions\r\nare imposed on countries that violate international law\r\nand the provisions of the United Nations Charter, and as\r\nwe all know Iraq violated international law and the\r\nsovereignty of other States by occupying the State of\r\nKuwait in 1990.\r\nOn 6 August 1990, the Security Council adopted its\r\nresolution 661 (1990), by which it imposed\r\ncomprehensive sanctions on the Iraqi regime. But Iraq did\r\nnot respond to decisions of international legitimacy. This\r\nlack of response obliged the Security Council, through the\r\nalliance, to use military force to expel Iraqi forces from\r\nKuwait. Regrettably, nine years later Iraq has still not\r\ncomplied with the relevant resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWith respect to my Foreign Minister\u0027s reference to\r\nthe three evaluation panels, of which the representative of\r\nIraq spoke in his statement, we did not quote the\r\nconclusions of the panels, but cited the results of their\r\nwork and made note of two facts: that Iraq, though\r\ninvited to do so, has not participated in the panel\r\nmeetings; and that all the panels concluded that Iraq has\r\nnot fully complied with the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil. We all know that the Security Council is now\r\nconsidering various draft resolutions aimed at finding a\r\nway to convince Iraq to resume its cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations and to implement Security Council\r\nresolutions, and at then looking into the question of lifting\r\nthe sanctions.\r\nWith reference to the issue of missing persons and\r\nprisoners of war, we have grown accustomed to Iraq\u0027s\r\nattempts to falsify the facts. It has become tedious to\r\nrespond to those lies and falsifications. The representative\r\nof Iraq believes that Kuwait is using the issue of missing\r\npersons and prisoners of war for its own “cheap\r\npurposes”. But the fact is that Kuwait agreed some years\r\nago to meet with Iraq for purely humanitarian purposes:\r\nthis is solely a humanitarian matter. Many meetings were\r\nheld, with and without Iraq. Initially, Iraq refused to sit\r\nwith the trilateral committee convened under Red\r\nCrescent auspices; two years later, it began to participate.\r\nBut it used these meetings for propaganda purposes.\r\nAs of last January, Iraq stopped participating in these\r\nmeetings, which are considering humanitarian issues only.\r\nIt stopped for political purposes, stating that the countries\r\nof the Alliance have no right to attend. Iraq discovered\r\nthat only after the passage of a few years.\r\n46\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nThe representative of Iraq claimed that his country has\r\nfulfilled all the conditions of these Security Council\r\nresolutions, that it has fulfilled the resolutions concerning\r\nthe elimination of weapons of mass destruction. Here we\r\nhave to ask, is the whole international community mistaken\r\nand Iraq alone right?\r\nThe 5 permanent members of the Security Council and\r\nthe 10 non-permanent members have for the last nine years\r\naffirmed repeatedly that Iraq has not fulfilled its obligations\r\nin accordance with Security Council resolutions, either in\r\nthe area of arms of mass destruction or in the area of\r\nrepatriation of prisoners of war and property. Furthermore,\r\nthere are regional organizations that are calling upon Iraq\r\nto continue to fulfil its obligations, including the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation\r\nCouncil, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and\r\nmany other regional organizations.\r\nThe Government of Iraq knows very well that it will\r\nsee the light at the end of the tunnel if it implements the\r\nresolutions of international legitimacy rather than continuing\r\nto stall and procrastinate about them. We hope that Iraq\r\nwill understand the lessons of the past and will pursue a\r\nrational and peaceful policy based on respecting the\r\nprinciples of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other\r\ncountries and good neighbourly relations. In this way the\r\ncountries and the peoples of the region, including the Iraqi\r\npeople, can find the strength and the ability to bring about\r\nprogress and development for their countries.\r\nThe Acting President: (spoke in Spanish): I now call\r\non the representative of Iraq, who wishes to speak a second\r\ntime in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I will try to be\r\nbrief. Iraq has implemented everything that is required of\r\nit by the resolutions of the Security Council, but the\r\nSecurity Council has not done what it should have, because\r\nthere is a secret American political programme against Iraq.\r\nEverybody knows that that political programme against Iraq\r\nis aimed at changing the Iraqi regime, bringing in a stooge\r\ngovernment, dividing Iraq and prolonging a destabilized\r\nsituation.\r\nIraq has done what has been requested of it, and has\r\nchallenged the United Nations Special Commission several\r\ntimes to give the international community one piece of\r\nevidence about prohibited weapons, activities or matériel.\r\nIt has failed. It should have implemented paragraphs 21 and\r\n22 of resolution 687 (1991), concerning the lifting of the\r\nsanctions. But this has not been done because of\r\nAmerican hegemony over the Security Council.\r\nConcerning the subject of the missing: Iraq\r\nparticipated very seriously in the trilateral committee, and\r\nduring these meetings Kuwait submitted the names of\r\n7,000 missing, then it reduced the number to 2,500.\r\nFinally, during the meetings of the committee, the number\r\nfell to only 600. All these individual files have been\r\nresolved with complete cooperation by Iraq. I do not\r\nknow why the United States and Britain insist on\r\nparticipating in these meetings when they have no missing\r\npersons or prisoners of war. France does not participate\r\nand has no objection to not participating.\r\nAs regards international legitimacy, under the\r\nAmerican hegemony over the Security Council, the issue\r\n47\r\nGeneral Assembly 11th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 23 September 1999\r\nis laughable. Most of the international community does not\r\nfavour the genocide being committed against the Iraqi\r\npeople. Most of the international community wants to lift\r\nthe sanctions imposed on Iraq. Only the United States\r\nwants to continue these sanctions.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.25 p.m.\r\n48\r\n"
