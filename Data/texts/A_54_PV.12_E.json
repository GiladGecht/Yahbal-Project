(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Mireya Moscoso, President of the\r\nRepublic of Panama\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Panama.\r\nMrs. Mireya Moscoso, President of the Republic of\r\nPanama, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama, Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Mireya Moscoso, and to invite her to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Moscoso (spoke in Spanish): The delegation\r\nof Panama is particularly gratified to welcome your\r\nelection, Sir, to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nthis session. We are pleased that the noble people of Africa,\r\nwhose aspiration to progress is shared by Panamanians, are\r\nso well represented in this forum, with you at the head of\r\nour deliberations and another distinguished African,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, leading the Secretariat. We join in the\r\ncongratulations conveyed to you in recognition of your\r\ncapacity and your skills, as well as in the expressions of\r\ngratitude addressed to the Secretary-General for his\r\ndedication to the Organization and his tireless efforts to\r\nmaintain international peace and security.\r\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, I also wish to\r\nconvey our appreciation for the outstanding way in which\r\nhe conducted our debates and his contribution to the\r\nsuccess of the deliberations of the Assembly.\r\nMy warmest congratulations, on behalf of the people\r\nand the Government of Panama, go also to the\r\nrepresentatives of Kiribati, Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga, States which were admitted to the United Nations\r\non the first day of this session. This event confirms\r\nbeyond question the universal and inclusive nature and\r\npurpose of this body devoted to fostering world peace and\r\npeoples\u0027 well-being.\r\nToday I am speaking on behalf of a young, proud\r\nnation that has written some illustrious pages in the\r\nhistory of the Latin American peoples\u0027 struggle to achieve\r\nnationhood. I am the spokesperson of a country where,\r\naccording to the design of the liberator, Simón Bolívar,\r\nthe first congress of the new nations of the continent took\r\nplace.\r\nHere before the Assembly, I represent a State whose\r\ngeographical location has given it an extraordinary role as\r\na transit route, a country that has devoted itself heart and\r\nsoul to the service of inter-oceanic transport and that, as\r\na result, has had to wait until the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury to recover dominion over the whole of its\r\nterritory.\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nAlong with my compatriots, I am filled with\r\nenthusiasm at the approach of the far-reaching event that is\r\nthe handing over of the Panama Canal to Panamanian\r\nhands. On the eve of this tremendous event that arouses\r\nsuch great expectations, we must recognize the efforts of\r\nthe many Panamanian men and women who, from the time\r\nwe became an independent State, began the nationalist\r\nstruggle to free ourselves from the burdens imposed on us\r\nby the first Canal Treaty, which was signed in 1903. Their\r\npatriotic deeds have been indelibly engraved in the history\r\nand the tradition of our people.\r\nSince its opening in 1914, the Canal has been an\r\nimportant symbol of our nationhood and the centre of the\r\nhopes of the Panamanian people to attain its development\r\nas a nation. The Canal, which turned us into the world\u0027s\r\nbridge and the heart of the universe, has given impetus to\r\nthe economic progress of the international community in the\r\ncourse of eight and a half decades. The Panamanian people\r\nwill now be able to participate fully in the prosperity that\r\nthe inter-oceanic waterway generates because, at the\r\nthreshold of the twenty-first century, Panama has\r\ndetermined that the Canal will be operated not only to\r\npunctually serve international trade, but also to promote\r\nsustainable human development. The administration of the\r\nCanal is therefore not simply a right, but also a\r\nresponsibility that obligates all Panamanians to administer\r\nthe waterway responsibly, efficiently and with absolute\r\nprobity. We have prepared ourselves for this with redoubled\r\ncare.\r\nThe process for the legal transition of the Canal began\r\nin 1977 with the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty. That\r\nagreement recorded the commitment of the United States to\r\ntransfer to Panama the administration and total control of\r\nthe inter-oceanic waterway on 31 December 1999. Since\r\nthen, the Governments of Panama and the United States of\r\nAmerica have worked in harmony to bring about a seamless\r\ntransition. Furthermore, and particularly since the 1989\r\nrestoration of constitutional rule, we Panamanians have\r\nagreed on the need to place the Canal above and beyond\r\npolitical differences. The fruit of this consensus was the\r\nfact that our political Constitution incorporates a provision\r\nfor the Canal that stipulates how the waterway is to be\r\nadministered from 31 December 1999. On the basis of that\r\nconstitutional provision, adopted in 1994, and with the wide\r\nparticipation of society, we developed the Panama Canal\r\nAuthority Act, which was adopted unanimously in the\r\nLegislative Assembly.\r\nThose two legal instruments, the constitutional\r\nprovision and the Act, provide the necessary legal\r\nmechanisms to ensure proper operation of the inter-\r\noceanic waterway. In recent years, the Canal has handled\r\nunprecedented volumes of traffic and cargo and has dealt\r\nwith them with exemplary care and efficiency,\r\nfundamentally thanks to our precious human resources,\r\nwho are almost all of Panamanian nationality.\r\nIn order to guarantee its future operation, Panama is\r\ncurrently implementing an intensive programme of\r\ninvestment at an approximate cost of one billion balboas\r\nin order to modernize and improve the inter-oceanic\r\nwaterway and to ensure that it is ready to cope with\r\ndemand and to maintain the quality of its services. It is\r\nhoped that this modernization and improvement\r\nprogramme will augment the capacity of the Canal by 20\r\nper cent.\r\nOne of the priorities of the Canal Authority is to\r\nprotect the environment. As the Act establishes, as of 31\r\nDecember 1999 the Authority will have the responsibility\r\nof vigilance over and conservation of the Canal basin, as\r\nwell as for coordinating the administration, conservation\r\nand use of the natural resources of that immense region.\r\nI should like to recognize the faultless way in which\r\nsuccessive United States Governments have fulfilled the\r\nprovisions of the Canal Treaty since it was signed in\r\n1977. Thanks to them, it has been possible to overcome\r\nthe obstacles that have been encountered over a long\r\nperiod of 20 years in the transfer of the inter-oceanic\r\nwaterway and in the hand-over of the military bases that\r\nwere established on our territory. Although there are\r\nseveral matters remaining for both Governments to\r\nconfront, such as decontamination of certain areas\r\ndesigned for military use by the United States Army, my\r\nGovernment trusts that the differences that continue to\r\nexist on this point will be resolved satisfactorily in a\r\nreasonable period of time.\r\nThe handover of the Canal to the jurisdiction of the\r\nRepublic of Panama is an event of far-reaching\r\nimportance not only for Panama and the United States,\r\nbut for the international community as well.\r\nConsequently, Panamanians hope that the representatives\r\nof the international community will join in celebrating the\r\ncommemorative events associated with the transition.\r\nPanamanians also hope that from now on the relations\r\nbetween Panama and the United States will be based on\r\nmutual respect, cooperation and equity in trade, in view\r\nof the tremendously strong nature of the historical, social,\r\npolitical and trading bonds that have joined the two\r\nnations since the last century. The benefits that control\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nover the Canal have yielded for the economy and the\r\npolitical standing of the United States determine that that\r\nnation should value the feeling of brotherhood that its\r\nleaders have for decades professed and truly act on them in\r\norder to begin a new period of relations with Panama that\r\nwill enable us to boost sustainable human development,\r\nwhich is something the Panamanian people very much\r\naspire to.\r\nIn recent years, my country, like many others, has\r\nsuffered the imposition of an economic orthodoxy applied\r\nmore with an eye towards the interests of the major\r\ninternational economic sectors than to the true development\r\nof peoples, without any consideration being given to the\r\nvalues that underpin our nationhood. This is the real state\r\nof affairs that obliges my Government to review the\r\norientation of our economic policy in order to promote the\r\ndevelopment of our people.\r\nWe are particularly concerned with the development\r\nof rural communities. These communities make an\r\ninvaluable contribution to the strength of our nationhood,\r\nbut they are also the ones that have the greatest difficulties\r\nin the struggle to ensure their survival. The fundamental\r\nconcern of my Government is bound up with improving the\r\nquality of life of the neediest. That objective depends to a\r\nlarge extent upon our efforts, but it also depends on our\r\nsucceeding in opening new markets for our products and\r\nachieving greater participation for private investment in our\r\ncountry and greater cooperation with developed nations.\r\nAt a time when the rights of women to equality and\r\nparticipation in the public life of nations are constantly\r\nbeing reaffirmed, I am proud to be the first Panamanian\r\nwoman ever to receive from her people, in an\r\nunmistakeable manifestation of confidence, the mandate to\r\nserve the Republic as President. I interpret this mandate as\r\na challenge calling on me to promote sustainable human\r\ndevelopment honestly and devotedly, in accordance with the\r\nuniversal political values that for half a century the\r\nOrganization has been upholding with admirable\r\npersistence: the democratic system of government and\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nConsequently, I bear the heavy responsibility in\r\nfollowing in the steps of my predecessors — exceptional\r\nleaders elected in democratic elections, such as Golda Meir,\r\nIndira Ghandi and Corazón Aquino, among others; and, in\r\nthe western hemisphere, Eugenia Charles, Violeta Chamorro\r\nand Janet Jagan. They helped to realize the warranted\r\naspiration that society should recognize women\u0027s skills and\r\nmerits to share on an equal footing in the great political\r\nresponsibility of presiding over a nation.\r\nFor Panamanian women I represent a dream come\r\ntrue. In this respect, my election is a significant advance\r\nin the campaign to ensure political equality for the\r\nwomen of my country and the rest of the continent.\r\nHowever, many Panamanian women are being hard hit by\r\npoverty and destitution, an unacceptable situation that\r\nthey share with children, older adults and men, whom so-\r\ncalled globalization takes no account of.\r\nIf we wish to secure the sustainability of human life\r\non this God-given earth, and if we wish to keep our\r\npromises as leaders, we must strive to eradicate hunger,\r\npoverty and destitution, which in my country afflict\r\nalmost two-fifths of the population.\r\nIf we wish to achieve these goals — which is what\r\nwe were elected to do — we must root out corruption,\r\nwhich is the major obstacle standing in the way of\r\nachieving the lofty results that our societies expect of us.\r\nIn this respect, I am pleased to assure the Assembly that\r\nPanama is doing everything in its power to put an end to\r\nthe use and trafficking of drugs as well as to the money-\r\nlaundering that is the result of that heinous phenomenon.\r\nWe the leaders of nations have the opportunity to\r\nundertake measures that will significantly help to fashion\r\na more just, more humane and fairer world governed by\r\nthe fundamental principles of democracy, justice and\r\nliberty, for which my people, together with all the peoples\r\nof the world, have fought throughout history.\r\nI urge dignitaries and the representatives of Member\r\nStates to embark resolutely on the struggle against\r\npoverty, destitution and corruption, which so adversely\r\naffect the living conditions of humankind. I would ask\r\nthem to come with us to the rescue of the weak, of those\r\nwho suffer unspeakable injustice and those whose way of\r\nlife is threatened by invisible forces that they can neither\r\nunderstand nor control.\r\nMy presence here is evidence of the Panamanians\u0027\r\nfirm belief in the order provided by this Organization,\r\nwhose struggle to achieve equality among peoples and\r\npeace among nations dates back more than 50 years. This\r\nOrganization has wholeheartedly championed human\r\nrights and battled against discrimination on all fronts.\r\nThat is why we believe in the need to strengthen it,\r\nbecause the United Nations is the court in which the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nvoice of smaller States can be heard, as well as the ultimate\r\nchampion of all of our rights.\r\nOn account of the trust that my people have in the\r\nUnited Nations, I invite all of the dignitaries and\r\nrepresentatives of Member States to join with us in\r\ncelebrating the recovery of the sovereignty that we never\r\nresigned ourselves to losing. At this historic moment, which\r\nPanamanians wish to share with the whole of humankind,\r\nthe bells of the world will ring out in jubilation because the\r\nprinciple of sovereignty, so often proclaimed in this and\r\nother international forums, will have been translated into\r\nreality in my country.\r\nMay God, the source of all authority, guide the\r\ndeliberations of the Assembly.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Panama for\r\nthe statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Mireya Moscoso, President of the Republic of\r\nPanama, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of\r\nthe Dominican Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Dominican Republic.\r\nMr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the\r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic, His Excellency\r\nMr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Reyna (spoke in Spanish): It is a particular\r\nhonour for me to address the Assembly on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of the Dominican Republic and to\r\ntake this opportunity to express my warmest congratulations\r\nto you, Sir, on your recent election as President of the fifty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to commend the excellent work of\r\nthat outstanding representative of our region, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Uruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, who so efficiently\r\nconducted the proceedings of the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nLet me also wish Mr. Kofi Annan every success in\r\nthe important and delicate tasks he is carrying out as\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nThis venerable institution, the United Nations, was\r\nfounded more than half a century ago with the lofty goal\r\nof safeguarding peace among nations and the integrity of\r\npeoples. The United Nations has made a significant\r\ncontribution to preventing armed conflict, reducing\r\ntension, resolving differences, promoting negotiation and\r\nagreements, and encouraging tolerance and non-violence.\r\nBut in a world that is becoming increasingly\r\ncomplex in the wake of an era marked by bipolar\r\nconfrontation between two models of civilization, and\r\nwith the rise of a technological revolution that has\r\ncontributed to an accelerated sense of time, a reduction in\r\ndistances and an increase in expectations, the United\r\nNations must exercise renewed leadership in order to\r\nconfront this new set of circumstances which, while they\r\nrepresent tremendous opportunities for the peoples of the\r\nworld, may also threaten their future.\r\nIt is no longer just a matter of preventing war and\r\nconflict; that unavoidable task will always be expected of\r\nthe Organization. The United Nations must ensure for\r\nevery human being on this earth a dignified, hopeful and\r\ndecent existence.\r\nNever before has the world accumulated so much\r\nwealth. At no other time in history has humankind been\r\nable, as it is today, to produce everything it needs in the\r\nway of food, clothing, shelter, communications and\r\ntransportation. The level of wealth that exists today is\r\nsuch that each and every day, more than a trillion dollars\r\ncirculates in international capital markets for purely\r\nspeculative purposes, producing what today is known as\r\na “casino economy”.\r\nIn order to give a rough idea of what that volume of\r\ncapital means, I must point out that a single day of\r\noperations in the financial markets is equivalent to twice\r\nthe annual gross national product of all the African\r\ncountries. However, that wealth is concentrated in just a\r\nfew countries that today are identified as central\r\ncountries, and inside each of them wealth is concentrated\r\nin a few hands that control industry, finance,\r\ntransportation and communications. The concentration of\r\nwealth in a few countries, and the influence that those\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\ncountries exert in the media, leads to the dissemination of\r\na consumer philosophy that in turn contributes to the\r\nadoption of artificial lifestyles and behaviour patterns that\r\nare conducive to waste, luxury and ostentation.\r\nAlongside all this wealth, however, the world has\r\nnever suffered so much poverty. Today, 1.3 billion people\r\nlive in extreme poverty, and most of them suffer from\r\nhunger every day. In such a wealthy world, 3 billion people\r\nsurvive on less than $2 a day, and each year 50 million\r\nchildren are permanently harmed because of malnutrition.\r\nSome 1.5 billion people have no access to drinking water,\r\nand more than 2 billion have no access to drainage or\r\nsewerage facilities. A large percentage have very limited\r\naccess to education, health care and housing, and hundreds\r\nof millions are unemployed or have no secure or permanent\r\nincome.\r\nThis stark and horrifying contrast between wealth and\r\npoverty constitutes a huge challenge for all the nations of\r\nthe world and the United Nations system as we approach\r\nthe twenty-first century. There are no magic formulas for\r\nresolving this situation. Only the concerted efforts of all\r\nnations, rich and poor, working to the same end in a spirit\r\nof solidarity and a sense of humanity will make it possible\r\nfor the whole of humankind to share on a basis of equality\r\nand social justice in the prodigious and unprecedented\r\ncreation of wealth in this era.\r\nFor some time, in various international forums, a set\r\nof balanced and reasonable ideas have been put forward,\r\nand if they were applied they would contribute to a\r\nsignificant reduction in poverty and to the creation of\r\nopportunities.\r\nThe world welcomed with great joy and satisfaction\r\nthe decision adopted by the countries members of the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\nto use 0.7 of their gross national product to finance a\r\nprogramme aimed at halving by the year 2015 the\r\npercentage of the inhabitants of developing countries living\r\nin extreme poverty. Despite the public commitment made\r\nby those countries, cooperation for development fell to 0.22\r\nof the combined product of the donor countries in 1997,\r\nwhich is the lowest figure since the 1950s.\r\nIt is unfair that while there is a daily transfer of over\r\n$1 trillion from the central or highly developed countries,\r\nthere is a tendency to decrease official development\r\nassistance for the least developed countries.\r\nThe developing countries have watched their external\r\ndebt climb from $1.6 trillion in 1993 to $2.5 trillion in\r\n1998. The external debt of Latin America increased from\r\n$44.786 billion in 1980 to $669 billion in 1997 — an\r\nalmost fifteen-fold increase in 17 years. Interest payments,\r\nwhich remained stable between 1980 and 1994 at a level\r\nbetween $24 billion and $28 billion, increased sharply, in\r\n1997 reaching $42 billion.\r\nThe current proposal is to reduce the debt of only\r\nthe heavily indebted poor countries. It seems to us that\r\nalthough this is a very significant first initiative, it is not\r\nsufficient because it excludes a group of countries,\r\nincluding the Dominican Republic, that have made\r\nsignificant efforts to achieve progress and peace, yet face\r\na titanic struggle to overcome underdevelopment and\r\npoverty.\r\nForgiving external debt, or at least reducing it\r\nsignificantly, or eliminating the interest would be a just\r\nacknowledgement of those countries that, in spite of their\r\ninternal difficulties, have adopted strict adjustment\r\nmeasures that have made it possible for them scrupulously\r\nto honour their international obligations. Forgiving\r\nexternal debt, or reducing it in any other way, would be\r\na true gesture of international solidarity aimed at reducing\r\npoverty. Furthermore, the resources that would be freed\r\nas a result would greatly benefit the creditor countries and\r\nthe international commercial banking community, since\r\nthe purchasing power of poor nations would be increased,\r\nthereby generating a new dynamism in the world\r\neconomy.\r\nThe so-called Asian crisis generated international\r\nturbulence, led to the Russian crisis and had a similar\r\nimpact on the Brazilian economy, which in turn affected\r\nthe Southern Cone economies. In analysing that crisis, the\r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund agreed\r\nthat it resulted from factors generated by the international\r\nflow of capital in the Asian stock markets. As a result of\r\nthat situation, which has been identified as the first major\r\ncrisis of the globalized economy, the economists of both\r\ninstitutions have proposed the creation of a new\r\ninternational financial architecture. That new architecture\r\nwould seek to stabilize the financial markets through the\r\nadoption of a set of careful measures, both national and\r\ninternational, to prevent another financial crisis in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThese proposals would seem to be wise and\r\nbeneficial. However, we believe that a true new\r\ninternational financial structure, as the focal point of a\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nglobal economy, should include the element of international\r\nsolidarity and cooperation aimed at the introduction of\r\nmeasures to reduce poverty. We cannot understand why\r\nmore than $1 trillion dollars circulates in international\r\nfinancial transactions every day while not a penny of those\r\nresources goes to the world\u0027s poor. All of Haiti\u0027s problems\r\nwould be solved with only a single minute\u0027s worth of\r\nbanking transactions on the international market. The same\r\ncould be said of Nicaragua and of Honduras, and even of\r\nour own country, the Dominican Republic.\r\nThe eradication of poverty is not an illusory goal.\r\nWith the wealth currently circulating world-wide, we could\r\nrestore a sense of dignity to each and every human being.\r\nDetermining how to achieve this is the big challenge facing\r\nthis Organization in the twenty-first century.\r\nTo meet that challenge the United Nations itself has to\r\ngo through a process of change and reform, beginning with\r\nacceptance that all its Member States are equal, with no\r\ndifferentiation between the powerful ones that possess the\r\nright of veto and the poor ones that have been marginalized\r\nin the very Organization that represents them. There is no\r\ndoubt that we now have a unique opportunity to reform the\r\nSecurity Council. The Dominican Republic is convinced\r\nthat reform of the Security Council must be carried out in\r\nkeeping with the principles of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution and the equal sovereignty of Member States,\r\nsince no reform will be acceptable if it leads to\r\ndiscriminatory treatment of developing nations by\r\ndeveloped nations.\r\nIt is in this spirit that the Dominican Republic aspires\r\nto election in the near future to a seat as a non-permanent\r\nmember of the Council. Our country, although small in\r\nsize, has a pacifist tradition that it would hope to channel\r\ninto and combine with the basic principles that should guide\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe Dominican Republic is proud to have introduced\r\nresolution 47/5, by which the Assembly proclaimed 1999 as\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons. Now that the Year\r\nis drawing to a close, we are especially proud of its\r\ninternational success. In the Dominican Republic, thanks to\r\nthe concerted efforts of the Government, in September\r\n1998, our Congress approved a bill of rights for older\r\npersons and established a national committee to oversee its\r\nimplementation. We consider this to have been our most\r\nimportant contribution the Year.\r\nAs host country to the International Research and\r\nTraining Institute for the Advancement of Women\r\n(INSTRAW), we wish once again to stress the\r\nfundamental importance of the Institute, which is one of\r\nonly three United Nations entities headquartered in a\r\ndeveloping country, and the only one situated in the\r\nregion of Latin America and the Caribbean. It is as\r\nimportant as it was in 1978, when it was created to\r\npromote the advancement of women, especially in our\r\ndeveloping nations. We therefore appeal to all\r\nGovernments to contribute to revitalizing the Institute so\r\nthat it may continue its important work.\r\nWe are confident that this great Organization will\r\nrenew itself and will act with the visionary leadership for\r\nwhich it was created for by its founders at the San\r\nFrancisco Conference, in a world that expects greater\r\nsolidarity among nations and a more just, equitable and\r\nhumane international order.\r\nI wish to conclude by calling on States Members of\r\nthe United Nations to participate in and support the\r\nMillennium Assembly. We believe that that important\r\nassembly will reaffirm our commitment to the United\r\nNations Charter, by highlighting the mission of the United\r\nNations system in the twenty-first century in the light of\r\nthe problems posed by globalization and of the need to\r\nensure that that process will be of benefit to us all.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Dominican Republic\r\nfor his statement.\r\nMr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the\r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Senegal, His Excellency Mr. Jacques Baudin.\r\nMr. Baudin (Senegal) (spoke in French): In electing\r\nyou unanimously to preside over its at the fifty-fourth\r\nsession, Sir, the General Assembly paid a well-deserved\r\ntribute to your country, the sister Republic of Namibia,\r\nwhich in November 1989, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations Transition Assistance Group, organized\r\nthat land\u0027s first free and fair elections, which marked the\r\nsuccessful culmination of the legitimate, heroic struggle\r\nof the Namibian people for independence, under the\r\nleadership of the South-West Africa People\u0027s Organization\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\n(SWAPO) and its President, His Excellency Mr. Sam\r\nNujoma. Now, following this happy sequence of events, we\r\nare now pleased to see Namibia at the helm of this historic\r\nsession of the General Assembly, represented by you\r\nyourself. On behalf of the delegation of Senegal, Sir, I\r\nconvey to you our warmest, fraternal congratulations; we\r\nwish you every success in your high post.\r\nI wish also to convey my sincere and warm\r\ncongratulations to your predecessor, Minister Didier Opertti,\r\non the competent, committed and authoritative way in\r\nwhich he guided the work of the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFinally, I wish once again to offer Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan my encouragement as he continues, with\r\nenergy, intelligence and vision, to carry out his delicate\r\ntasks authoritatively and successfully in a particularly\r\ndifficult global context. I feel bound to say that his election\r\nto head the Secretariat of the United Nations was a source\r\nof pride for Africa and a source of satisfaction for all\r\npeace- and justice-loving countries. During the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s visit to Senegal, Mr. Abdou Diouf, President of\r\nthe Republic of Senegal, made it clear that the Senegalese\r\nGovernment was committed to and actively supported the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nI take genuine pleasure and great joy in welcoming\r\namong us the delegations representing the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga,\r\nwhich have just been admitted as full-fledged Members of\r\nthe great United Nations family. These admissions attest to\r\nand bolster the universal character of our Organization, thus\r\nhelping strengthen its aims and principles.\r\nAllow me to use the idea of universality to explain\r\nand justify, if that is necessary, my country\u0027s unreserved\r\nsupport for the admission of the Republic of China, with its\r\n22 million inhabitants, as a full Member of the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies. The Republic of\r\nChina — a democratic country concerned with safeguarding\r\nand promoting human rights, a world economic Power\r\nrecognized by nations, and, last but not least, a nation that\r\nmaintains trade relations through commercial delegations —\r\nshares with deep conviction our common faith in the noble\r\nideals of peace, solidarity and cooperation enshrined in the\r\nCharter. That country, for the sake of the principle of the\r\nuniversality of our Organization, should take its place once\r\nmore. Simple justice requires this, and the ideals embodied\r\nin our Charter dictate it, because it is in the name of these\r\nprinciples that other States are admitted as Members of this\r\nOrganization, which I welcome.\r\nOur fifty-fourth regular session, we must all agree,\r\nis an event of great historical and political significance.\r\nHistorical, because it is the penultimate session — or the\r\nlast, depending on how you look at it — of the twentieth\r\ncentury, the century in which it was born, after two world\r\nwars and other great calamities for humankind, the\r\nconsequences of which are still being felt.\r\nThis century has also been one of light, with\r\ntremendous advances achieved by the human race in\r\nvarious fields, particularly in science and technology. This\r\nsession takes on special political importance because it is\r\nan irreplaceable tool in the service of peace, international\r\nsecurity, cooperation and the promotion of human rights\r\nand is a timely opportunity for dialogue, reflection and\r\npreparation for the great encounters of the coming\r\nmillennium.\r\nAt the threshold of the third millennium, we should\r\nwonder and think together, in the framework of this\r\nOrganization, about what kind of peace, development and\r\nsolidarity we should build in the coming century. It is a\r\nrecognized fact that current changes, the range of whose\r\neffects in the political, economic and social spheres\r\ncannot be foreseen, call inevitably for a deep-going\r\nreform of the United Nations and impose a need to adapt\r\nthe Organization to the demands of the times. Thus, we\r\nneed to be clear-sighted, creative and realistic and make\r\ninnovative, broad-ranging and constructive proposals that\r\ncan be translated into concrete actions taken solely in the\r\ninterests of all our peoples and all our nations, which\r\nmake up the family that we call humankind.\r\nIn this respect, reform of the Security Council is a\r\nmajor test of our resolve to modernize this important\r\nbody, which we need to endow with greater transparency,\r\ngreater democracy, greater authority and greater\r\nlegitimacy — in short, greater credibility.\r\nMany proposals have already been made, but in\r\nrestructuring this key organ of the system, we need to go\r\nbeyond them, demonstrating creativity and a willingness\r\nto compromise, considering only the interests of this\r\nOrganization at the service of humanity. From this\r\nstandpoint, in the Algiers Declaration, the States of Africa\r\nunanimously recalled the legitimate demands embodied in\r\nthe Harare Declaration adopted by the Conference of\r\nHeads of State and Government of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU).\r\nThe pressing need to adapt the United Nations\r\nsystem to the realities of the coming century should,\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nnonetheless, not obscure current acute needs associated with\r\nthe maintenance and promotion of peace in the world. In\r\nthis spirit, as the international community celebrates the\r\n100th anniversary of the Hague Peace Conference, I wish\r\nto say how much we welcome certain significant advances\r\ntowards peace in Africa.\r\nWe commend the Peace Agreement signed in Lomé\r\non 7 July 1999, thanks to the tireless efforts of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nand President Eyadema, in the context of the Sierra Leone\r\nconflict. We also commend the Abuja Peace Agreement and\r\nthe additional protocols in the context of the Guinea-Bissau\r\nconflict, thanks to the mediation of ECOWAS, under the\r\nchairmanship of Nigeria and Togo. Senegal strongly\r\nsupports the Governments of Sierra Leone and\r\nGuinea-Bissau in their efforts to build peace, to move\r\nresolutely towards national reconciliation and to implement\r\na policy of economic and social recovery in their countries.\r\nIn the same spirit, the signing last 10 July, in Lusaka, of\r\nthe Ceasefire Agreement among the principal parties to the\r\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is another\r\ncause for satisfaction and hope.\r\nI would also like to touch on the Lockerbie affair in\r\nthe hopes that the attitudes of the countries offer the\r\npossibility of a successful outcome.\r\nLast, but not least, my country expresses the warmest\r\nhope that the referendum process under way in Western\r\nSahara will be completed as early as possible in accordance\r\nwith the letter and spirit of the United Nations settlement\r\nplan adopted in 1991, as well as that of the Houston\r\nagreements, with full respect for the inalienable rights of all\r\ninhabitants of Western Sahara to participate in the\r\nreferendum. Allow me — and I think this is the right place\r\nto do so — to pay humble tribute to the memory of\r\nKing Hassan II.\r\nFinally, we hope that with the assistance of the great\r\nPowers and the cooperation of Indonesia, the situation in\r\nEast Timor will be brought under control by the United\r\nNations in order to ensure that the legitimate rights of the\r\nTimorese people prevail.\r\nThese significant breakthroughs should not make us\r\noverlook the situations in Angola and Somalia, or the\r\nconflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, where, in spite of the\r\npraiseworthy efforts of the OAU, there has been no serious\r\nsign of a final settlement. We must therefore continue our\r\nefforts because our only salvation lies in peace and in\r\nreconciliation.\r\nIn this sense, the evolution we have witnessed in the\r\nMiddle East gives us grounds for hope, the hope of\r\nfinally seeing a climate of complete trust and confidence\r\nand a sincere resumption of negotiations between Israelis\r\nand Palestinians and between Israel and the Arab\r\ncountries, with the rights of the peoples of the region\r\nrespected. My country, having presided over the\r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of\r\nthe Palestinian People ever since its creation, reaffirms its\r\nsupport for and solidarity with the fraternal people of\r\nPalestine, the Palestinian Authority and its head, President\r\nYasser Arafat, which have been struggling now for more\r\nthan half a century for the creation of an independent and\r\nsovereign Palestinian State.\r\nWe solemnly reaffirm our support for the Bethlehem\r\n2000 project which has the objective of celebrating in\r\nBethlehem, on Palestinian soil, the second millennium\r\nsince the birth of Christ.\r\nFurthermore, the Israeli Government seems now to\r\nwant to work resolutely for peace. We urge it to continue\r\non this path. It is the only approach that responds to the\r\nsituation of the peoples of the subregion and to the\r\nhardships connected to the constraints imposed by\r\nglobalization.\r\nBefore concluding the subject of peace and security,\r\nI would like to state that my country supports any move\r\nto protect, safeguard and promote the rights of women\r\nand children. Its legal code has been modified to translate\r\nthat choice and those convictions into its own domestic\r\nlaw.\r\nI should like now to deal with the other dimension\r\nof peace: development cooperation. The United Nations,\r\nresponding once again to its mission to serve the peoples\r\nof the world, has, during the major conferences of the\r\ndecade, provided a framework for the definition of a\r\ncoherent set of programmes based on consensus. These\r\nprogrammes continue to inspire our common efforts\r\ntowards sustainable development.\r\nBut a careful review of the realities of this century\r\nnow coming to a close lead us to note that our\r\nachievements have been seriously undermined by the\r\ncontradictory tendencies that are a hallmark of humanity\r\nas it enters the third millennium. The lack of sufficient\r\nsustained growth in the world as a whole means that the\r\nglobal economy is facing great risks in the years to come.\r\nIndeed, because of a lack of sufficient growth, trade\r\ntensions are threatening to increase between\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nunderdeveloped countries and around them, and thus the lag\r\nin development can only increase, increasing the mob of\r\nuncontrolled emigration.\r\nIn addition, the gap that has been emerging over many\r\nyears is becoming increasingly clear. On the one hand we\r\nsee a small number of regions enjoying a high standard of\r\nliving or rapid development. In these countries the volume\r\nof trade, of interdependence and competition is increasing.\r\nOn the other hand, there is a group of countries — more\r\nnumerous and more populous — in which the standards of\r\nliving are poor and stagnating. They are for the most part\r\nnot involved in this ever-tighter network of commercial,\r\nfinancial and industrial exchanges. It is difficult for them to\r\nfind markets for their products, they suffer from capital\r\nflight, and businesses avoid setting up in these countries.\r\nHowever, over the last four years, the gross national\r\nproduct of Africa has grown at an annual average rate of\r\n4.5 per cent, resulting in a year-on-year increase in per\r\ncapita incomes. This is particularly remarkable because the\r\nprogress is attributable, above all, to internal adjustment\r\nefforts rather than to external phenomena. Nevertheless,\r\ndespite this macroeconomic performance, most African\r\ncountries do not possess the basic means for ensuring\r\nsustainable growth in a future of a kind that would enable\r\nthem to achieve their poverty-reduction objectives in\r\nkeeping with the medium-term goals set at the World\r\nSummit on Social Development in Copenhagen, because the\r\nrequired rate of growth is in the order of 8 per cent per\r\nyear.\r\nWhile it is true that the slow pace of integration of\r\nAfrican economies into the global economy has protected\r\nmost of these economies from the most violent shocks of\r\nrecent financial crises, the other side of the coin is that\r\nAfrica is not in a position to take full advantage of\r\nglobalization, which could increase the resources available\r\nfor productive investment. However, the developing\r\ncountries will not and cannot escape the effects of\r\nglobalization. We would therefore like to stress here — in\r\nparticular to our African partners in various initiatives such\r\nas the second Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment (TICAD II), the United States/Africa forum\r\nand the negotiations between the European Union and\r\nAfrica, the Caribbean and the Pacific — the need to\r\nencourage the efforts that have been undertaken,\r\nparticularly in the elimination of the rigidities and\r\nimbalances that persist in the global economy.\r\nIn this regard, it might be worthwhile to reaffirm the\r\ncommitment that joins the developing and the developed\r\ncountries within the World Trade Organization and\r\ninvolves recognition of the need to make significant\r\nefforts so that the developing countries — the least-\r\ndeveloped in particular — are assured of a share in the\r\ngrowth in world trade in keeping with their development\r\nneeds.\r\nBut also, an examination of the way the principles\r\nof the multilateral trade system created at the Uruguay\r\nRound have been implemented reveals that commitments\r\nhave not been honoured: many obstacles impede access\r\nby products from the South in general, and from African\r\ncountries in particular, to Northern markets. Tariff\r\nbarriers, sliding-scale increases in duty rates, anti-\r\ndumping measures and animal and plant hygiene\r\nmeasures all represent acts and attitudes that impede trade\r\nand that affect our exports — and, thus, our trade\r\nsurpluses. That is why we venture to hope that the Seattle\r\nRound in November this year will take into greater\r\naccount not only the concerns of the developing countries\r\npositions by removing obstacles to their complete\r\nparticipation in world trade on the basis of the principles\r\nof justice and equity — particularly by working to reduce\r\nand eliminate the restrictive and distorting effects that the\r\naforementioned barriers, laws and measures have on\r\ntrade — but will also take into consideration social rights\r\nand sustainable development as inalienable elements in all\r\nworld trade.\r\nGiven the significant efforts by the African countries\r\nto achieve their recent economic performance levels, it\r\nwill be a Herculean task in terms of resources for them to\r\nachieve and maintain 8 per cent annual growth in their\r\ngross domestic product, in order to reduce poverty. We\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to welcome the new\r\ninternational climate for finding a solution to the African\r\ndebt crisis, particularly given that the total of this debt —\r\nestimated at $350 billion in 1998 — represents 300 per\r\ncent of Africa\u0027s export earnings.\r\nTo this end, the proposals by a some G-8 countries,\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment and other organs of the United Nations, as\r\nwell as the recent studies by the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, are signs of a new realism, i.e., that most of\r\nthe debt cannot be repaid, that the debt is a major\r\nobstacle to balanced growth in African countries, and that\r\nthe current machinery for debt settlement, in particular the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative,\r\nis too slow, too selective and imposes too many\r\nconditions. The principal members of the World Bank and\r\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) must accept the\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nidea, among others, of increasing the resources for the\r\nHIPC significantly by selling gold reserves.\r\nFurthermore, despite the pressures within the donor\r\ncommunity to reduce aid volumes, the economic\r\nperformance of Africa and the continent\u0027s commitment to\r\nstructural reform can be maintained only on the basis of\r\nexpansion, not contraction: increased development\r\nassistance is essential if we are to achieve the fundamental\r\nobjectives of development.\r\nFinally, despite the praiseworthy efforts of our various\r\ncountries to implement economic and financial reforms,\r\ninflows of direct foreign investment remain marginal.\r\nIn highlighting these major factors in the current\r\nglobal economic situation, I am far from wishing to shirk\r\nan enduring truth: sustainable development is the individual\r\nresponsibility of each State. The need for the international\r\ncommunity to find a more global and more judicious\r\nsolution to the debt problem in no way detracts from the\r\nneed for African countries to manage their economies\r\nbetter.\r\nThis attitude towards debt will be put into practice by\r\nthe definition and implementation of a high-quality\r\nmacroeconomic framework; by a significant intensification\r\nof efforts towards national thrift to accompany international\r\nfinancing; and by respect for the state of law, transparency,\r\ncontrol and responsibility in the management of public\r\naffairs. Thanks to the guidance and choices of Mr. Abdou\r\nDiouf, President of the Republic, my country subscribes to\r\nthese fundamental principles, on which the policy of the\r\nGovernment of Senegal is based.\r\nI have particularly stressed questions of peace and\r\ndevelopment because we live on a continent where peace is\r\nthreatened every day by underdevelopment and where\r\ndevelopment efforts are made precarious by the absence of\r\npeace. It is therefore important that efforts to consolidate\r\npeace in Africa be accompanied by extraordinary efforts to\r\nincrease the quality and quantity of development assistance\r\nin order significantly to reduce our debt and increase the\r\nflow of productive investment to our continent and to\r\nestablish, if not a Marshall Plan for Africa, at least a plan\r\nfor financing its development.\r\nMy delegation fervently hopes that, at the dawn of the\r\ntwenty-first century, the opportunity will be found to revive\r\ninternational cooperation for development in order to build\r\na more humane world. I am convinced that we have the\r\nmeans and the intelligence; we must also summon the\r\npolitical determination to do so. Thus, in order to improve\r\ninteraction, Africa for its part has agreed to promote\r\neconomic integration and to go one step further by\r\ncreating a union of African States. This was the sense of\r\nthe Syrte Declaration adopted on 9 September 1999 at the\r\nFourth Extraordinary Summit of heads of State of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, convened on the happy\r\ninitiative of Mr. Al-Qadhafi.\r\nI am convinced that the wealthy nations are clearly\r\naware of their various and diverse responsibilities and that\r\nthey will not shirk their obligations. Indeed, should they\r\ndo so, God forbid, the eternal night of hideous poverty\r\nwill blanket almost the entire world. I express the genuine\r\nhope, willingly undertaken and profoundly shared by all\r\nnations, that we cannot remain indifferent to anything that\r\nis human. I am therefore convinced that, together, we can\r\nsave humanity.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kamal Kharrazi.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (spoke in Persian; interpretation\r\nfurnished by the delegation): I wish to extend to you, Sir,\r\nmy sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly and to assure\r\nyou of the full support and cooperation of the delegation\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran in the discharge of your\r\nresponsibilities. I should also like to thank your\r\npredecessor for his tireless efforts during his tenure.\r\nMay I also express the profound gratitude of my\r\nGovernment to our Secretary-General, who, with\r\nunsurpassed wisdom and sagacity, has played an immense\r\nrole in advancing the objectives of the United Nations.\r\nThe twentieth century we are leaving behind has\r\nbeen one of invaluable experiences, both positive and\r\nnegative. On the positive side, the rejection of force as an\r\ninstrument of policy has emerged as a fundamental\r\nprinciple of international behaviour; the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights as universal concepts have\r\nattained priority on the global agenda; astonishing\r\nprogress in science and technology has brought\r\nunprecedented welfare to humanity; knowledge has\r\nbecome the common heritage of humanity; previously\r\ncolonized countries have been empowered to determine\r\ntheir own destiny; dictatorship and despotism have been\r\nseriously challenged by the universal demand for\r\nparticipation; and the technological revolution in the field\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nof communications has fundamentally changed human\r\ninteraction.\r\nAlongside these positive developments, the twentieth\r\ncentury has also witnessed various negative phenomena and\r\ntrends. The totalitarian mentality continues to prevail at the\r\ndomestic and international levels; poverty persists in its\r\nmaterial, spiritual and cultural manifestations; the gap\r\nbetween rich and poor has widened; the world has never\r\nfreed itself from conflict and bloodshed; the destructive\r\nterritorial wars of the past have turned into tragic ethnic,\r\nracial and sectarian rivalries; extremism survives in its\r\nvarious forms and manifestations, causing irreparable\r\ndamage; and terrorism continues to challenge humanity with\r\nits ruthless recurrence in various parts of the world.\r\nA hallmark of the twentieth century has been the\r\nworldwide emergence of demands for individual and\r\ncollective participation, defying totalitarianism and\r\nauthoritarian rule everywhere. Decision-making is no longer\r\nan autocratic or even elitist enterprise. It is a participatory\r\nprocess demanding collective contribution. Totalitarian\r\ntendencies and ideologies in various countries and at the\r\ninternational level are finally learning that their time is long\r\npassed.\r\nThe global surge of democracy and popular\r\nparticipation as the sole guarantors of stability and the\r\nlitmus tests of good-governance is indeed a development of\r\nhistoric proportions. Self-determination, collective\r\nparticipation and consent of the governed represent valuable\r\nand time-tested rational alternatives.\r\nIn this century, Iran has undergone fundamental\r\nchanges in the pursuit of independence, liberty, justice,\r\nparticipation and good governance. Since time immemorial\r\nand throughout its tumultuous history, Iran has been the\r\nlocus of innovation. It has proudly preserved its genuine\r\nnational and religious heritage, and yet, in keeping with the\r\nbest traditions of that very culture, it has never failed to\r\nembrace modernity, new ideas and new ways.\r\nIn today\u0027s Islamic Republic, the democratization\r\nprocess is marching forward on the solid foundation of\r\ndemocratic Islamic principles. The Government is resolutely\r\ndetermined vigorously to pursue the implementation and\r\nconsolidation of its reform programmes. The cornerstones\r\nof these reform policies are the promotion and protection of\r\nconstitutional liberties; upholding the rule of law;\r\nstrengthening democratic norms and institutions; the\r\ninstitutionalization of the culture of participation; the\r\nenhancement of the role of people in government; the full\r\naccountability of public officials; increasing transparency;\r\nstrengthening the institutions of civil society; the\r\npromotion of tolerance, a pluralistic society of multiple\r\nvoices and domestic trends, coupled with confidence-\r\nbuilding and the breaking of old barriers in foreign\r\nrelations.\r\nUndoubtedly, open, dynamic and democratic\r\nsocieties are by definition susceptible to dissension and\r\neven rivalries. This has historically accompanied the\r\nprocess of reform, constituting an inescapable ingredient\r\nof this path. The sound and successful approach of\r\nPresident Khatami\u0027s Administration in dealing with these\r\nsocial and political challenges, which has enjoyed the full\r\nsupport of the leadership, has been to promote and protect\r\nfundamental democratic values and ensure the rule of law\r\nand due process, as well as security and stability, which\r\ntogether form the foundations of a flourishing and open\r\nsociety.\r\nCollective participation extends beyond local and\r\ndomestic decision-making, and is becoming increasingly\r\na global requirement for an effective presence in\r\ninternational decision-making. The full participation of all\r\nStates is a necessary but not sufficient response to this\r\nneed. It requires the effective contribution of civil society\r\norganizations in all aspects of the global decision-making\r\nprocess.\r\nDuring this century, exclusion often surfaced as a\r\nparadigm of global interaction, in which the world is\r\nviewed in terms of modes of loyalty, countries are viewed\r\nas belonging to coalitions or not and are divided,\r\nrewarded and blamed accordingly. Today, the utility of\r\nthis paradigm is being seriously questioned, as is the\r\nvalidity of some of our basic assumptions.\r\nThe cold war was the last episode of exclusion. It\r\nhas undoubtedly left its negative imprint on international\r\naffairs, but more regrettably it has permanently scarred\r\nthe mentality of global actors and international relations\r\ntheory.\r\nOne of the most horrifying manifestations of\r\nexclusion has been the global arms race. It literally aims\r\nat marginalizing others through the accumulation of\r\nconventional and mass-destruction agents of death, the\r\nformation of rival military blocs and the unbridled race to\r\nexpand spheres of influence and domination.\r\nThe persistence of this paradigm is largely\r\nresponsible for the most serious threat to the Middle East\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nregion. Exploiting this mode of global interaction, Israel,\r\nwith impunity, has trampled the most fundamental rights of\r\nthe Palestinian people, including their right to self-\r\ndetermination, has driven millions of people into diaspora,\r\nhas illegally occupied territories of others in the Syrian\r\nGolan and southern Lebanon and has even gone as far as to\r\ncommit extortion for partial fulfilment of its obligations.\r\nThis has impeded the realization of the legitimate right of\r\nthe Palestinian people, and indeed the entire Islamic world,\r\nto establish an independent Palestinian State in the occupied\r\nterritories, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. The same\r\nregime has posed a grave threat to regional and global\r\npeace and security through the acquisition of nuclear\r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction and the\r\nrejection of universal non-proliferation regimes.\r\nThe global culture of violence and exclusion, which\r\npartially emanated from justification of violence as an\r\nacceptable means to achieve coalition objectives, has\r\nunwittingly nurtured global menaces ranging from ethnic\r\nsuppression to terrorism.\r\nTwo decades of fratricide and devastation in\r\nAfghanistan has been the fruit of an illusion of total\r\ndomination of one group or ethnicity at the expense of the\r\nexclusion of others. This has stalled the constructive and\r\ntireless efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special\r\nEnvoy, Ambassador Brahimi, to bring about a peaceful\r\nsolution through the establishment of a broad-based\r\nGovernment. Thus, today peace and stability in Afghanistan\r\nand respect for the most fundamental rights of Afghan\r\nwomen, men and children in Taliban-controlled areas have\r\nall but become distant dreams, turning Afghanistan, with its\r\nproud and rich heritage, into a bastion of narcotics,\r\nterrorism and regional instability.\r\nAllow me to refer to terrorism, which has become a\r\nserious menace and a global challenge. It, of course,\r\nvictimizes innocent human beings. But its real targets are\r\nthe rule of law, popular participation and institutions of\r\ncivil society. In fact, to have fertile ground, terrorists need\r\nand seek to cultivate and entrench a culture of violence. It\r\nis for this very reason that, as the Iranian people and\r\nGovernment have forged a national consensus to\r\ninstitutionalize the rule of law and participation, known\r\nterrorist groups have significantly intensified their campaign\r\nof terror against them. It is even more regrettable that they\r\nstill find foreign benefactors and sanctuaries. The people\r\nand the Government of Iran have no doubt that the aim of\r\nthis treacherous terrorist campaign is to undermine the\r\nnational determination to reject violence in all its forms,\r\nand we are all determined to prove the terrorists wrong.\r\nTerrorism can and will be contained and eradicated\r\nif we all join hands with firm and resolute determination.\r\nBut we need to recognize that the application of double\r\nstandards seriously undermines such a global campaign.\r\nAcquiescence to terrorists of whatever stripe impedes the\r\nemergence of a unified, transparent and non-\r\ndiscriminatory universal machinery to combat and root\r\nout all forms of terrorism. Iran, while condemning\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, is fully\r\nprepared to engage actively in such global cooperation.\r\nIt is thus necessary to work collectively today to lay\r\nthe foundations of a new paradigm of inclusion and\r\ndialogue on participation, tolerance, understanding and\r\ncollective cooperation. The initiative of a dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, presented last year by President Khatami, is\r\na proposal to move away from a world driven by\r\nexclusion and monologue and to begin the new\r\nmillennium with a gentler, more civilized approach for a\r\nbetter tomorrow. The overwhelming reception by the\r\ninternational community and the designation of the year\r\n2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations indicate a common longing of humanity for\r\na different approach to interactions in the next century.\r\nIn our view, the designation of the Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations is not a mere recognition of the self-\r\nevident necessity for dialogue at the global level. It is in\r\nfact a declaration of readiness to try a new model of\r\ninteraction. The fundamental assumption of this proposal\r\nis that the prosperity, welfare, development and security\r\nof one group, in spite of, or at the expense of, the\r\npoverty, hunger, underdevelopment and insecurity of\r\nothers are simply deceptive and short-lived, and thus they\r\nneed to be abandoned. In certain fields, this underlying\r\nprinciple has been universally accepted, whereas in many\r\nother fields, we have a long and arduous way to go.\r\nToday, no one has the illusion that the environment\r\ncould be defined in terms of political or geographic\r\nboundaries. Neither can the eradication of narcotics be a\r\npurely national enterprise. We in Iran are particularly\r\ncognizant of that fact, as we have had to endure a heavy\r\nhuman, social and financial toll in our campaign against\r\ninternational narcotics traffickers.\r\nIn the field of human rights, it appears that the\r\ninternational community is gradually embracing a more\r\ncooperative approach based on constructive engagement\r\nand understanding. Pluralism, acceptance of diversity and\r\ndialogue among cultures and civilizations in this pivotal\r\narea of international affairs will undoubtedly enhance the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nuniversality of human rights instruments, making them\r\nmore readily acceptable and globally implementable.\r\nDialogue is the product of concurrent acceptance of\r\ncommonality and diversity. From this perspective,\r\ninternational endorsement of dialogue illustrates recognition\r\nof the diversity of cultures and civilizations and the\r\nreaffirmation of the cultural rights of all peoples and\r\nnations, so that all human beings can engage members of\r\nother civilizations from the standpoint of their own culture,\r\ncivilization and historical background, and not by simply\r\nechoing the mentality of a totally alien culture. Only such\r\ninteraction can be mutually enriching and indeed\r\nmeaningful. The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believes\r\nthat the recognition and reaffirmation of cultural rights of\r\nnations is a first step for the promotion of sustained\r\ndialogue.\r\nIn the field of peace and security, we need to truly\r\naccept the reality that security is an indivisible need and\r\ndemand of the entire human race. Thus we need to set aside\r\nthe residuals of the bipolar system and replace bloc security\r\numbrellas with a new and innovative concept of global\r\nsecurity networking, an inclusive and participatory system\r\nwhich uses the existing mechanisms in a complementary\r\nrather than competing scheme.\r\nAttainment of this objective can be immensely helped\r\nand expedited by empowering civil society organizations to\r\nparticipate actively in global disarmament and security\r\nforums and debates. This valuable role has hitherto been\r\nmostly limited to the social and human rights fields, and the\r\nsecurity and disarmament arena has been more or less\r\ndeprived of its contribution and insight. This deficiency\r\nneeds to be rectified.\r\nMeanwhile, short- and medium-term measures include\r\nconfidence-building at the regional and global levels,\r\ntransparency in the field of armaments, a steady reduction\r\nof military expenditures, the elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\r\nin the interim. The Islamic Republic of Iran has itself\r\nadopted these measures, and has based its foreign policy on\r\nconfidence-building and the removal of old barriers, with\r\nparticular emphasis on its immediate neighbourhood.\r\nAs the Chairman of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, we have also made significant progress in\r\ndeveloping mechanisms and instruments to enhance\r\nconfidence among Member States and to institutionalize\r\ndialogue and coordination with other bodies, such as the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nThe United Nations has an indispensable pivotal role\r\nin shaping the new world of the next millennium. The\r\npreservation and extension of its achievements, coupled\r\nwith revitalization of the moral authority and political\r\nrelevance of the United Nations in the coming\r\nmillennium, require restoration of the fundamental\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations, as well as\r\na rational, transparent and participatory process of\r\nreassessment of the existing institutions.\r\nEnhancement of the relevance of the United Nations\r\nrequires, first and foremost, strengthening the role and\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the General Assembly, by\r\nfocusing its deliberations on contemporary challenges and\r\nproblems facing our world today, engaging it in timely\r\nand effective decision-making to address global economic\r\nand political issues, and enabling it to seriously examine\r\nand effectively react to the reports of other organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council, as\r\nmandated by the Charter. In this context, we believe that\r\nthe General Assembly, as the sole democratic, universal\r\nand transparent organ of the United Nations, is the proper\r\nforum to carry out an in-depth analysis of the implications\r\nof the emerging debate on collective action to address\r\nhumanitarian catastrophes. The imperative of maintaining\r\nthe integrity of the Charter system is the common point\r\nof departure in this exercise.\r\nI firmly believe that the success of next year\u0027s\r\nMillennium Summit rests on an innovative approach to\r\nprepare the United Nations system to march — and\r\nindeed to lead the world community — towards a new\r\nparadigm of international affairs. Outdated approaches\r\nand old remedies have failed to rectify the main problems\r\nafflicting humanity, even at times exacerbating and\r\naggravating them. In our collective quest for fundamental\r\nsolutions, we all need to discard old perceptions,\r\nassumptions and conceptual frameworks. This is the very\r\npremise, as well as the primary goal, of dialogue between\r\ncivilizations.\r\nVital change in human societies requires brave and\r\nbold leadership by statesmen and the elite to question old,\r\nineffective ways and open the arena for the participation\r\nof thinkers, intellectuals and civil society organizations in\r\nthe search for a kinder and gentler tomorrow. We hope\r\nthat our Assembly will have such bravery and foresight.\r\nThe President: I next call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, His Excellency Mr. Felipe Pérez\r\nRoque.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): In this\r\nHall today are representatives of wealthy countries and also\r\nrepresentatives of poor countries, who constitute the\r\nmajority. There are ministers and ambassadors from\r\ncountries whose per capita gross domestic product is\r\n$25,000 dollars, and others who represent countries where\r\nthat figure is a mere $300 dollars. Moreover, that difference\r\ngrows year by year.\r\nThere are representatives of countries that appear to\r\nhave a promising future. These are the countries with only\r\n20 per cent of the world\u0027s population, but 86 per cent of its\r\ngross domestic product, 82 per cent of world export\r\nmarkets, 68 per cent of direct foreign investment, and 74\r\nper cent of all of the telephone lines on the planet.\r\nWhat can we say about the future of those whom we\r\nrepresent here who account for 80 per cent of the world\u0027s\r\npopulation, living in countries that were colonized and\r\nplundered for centuries to increase the wealth of the former\r\nmetropolises? It is true that time has passed, and that our\r\nhistory is what it is and not what we might have wished it\r\nto be. But must we simply resign ourselves to a future that\r\nis essentially the same?\r\nCan we feel reassured knowing that the wealth of the\r\nthree richest people in the world is greater than the\r\ncombined gross domestic product of the 48 least developed\r\ncountries, with their population of 600 million, whose\r\nrepresentatives are present in this hall today demanding\r\njustice?\r\nIn this hall today we have representatives of countries\r\nwhere most of the population — which is hardly growing\r\nat all — are guaranteed decent living standards and where\r\nsome live in opulence. These populations spend $12 billion\r\non perfume and $17 billion on pet food every year.\r\nBut there is a majority represented in this hall that has\r\nno reason to feel optimistic. This majority comprises 900\r\nmillion people who go hungry and 1.3 billion who live in\r\npoverty. My brothers and sisters here today representing\r\nAfrica have no reason to feel reassured. They know that\r\ntoday there are 23 million people on their continent who are\r\nHIV-positive. They also know that it costs $12,000 to treat\r\njust one person infected with the virus, which means that it\r\nwould take almost $300 billion a year for all the AIDS\r\npatients in Africa to receive the same treatment currently\r\nprovided to AIDS sufferers in wealthy countries.\r\nCould my colleagues representing 6 billion of the\r\nplanet\u0027s inhabitants — to which a further 80 million are\r\nadded every year, almost all of them in the Third\r\nWorld — really think that a situation like this could\r\ncontinue unchanged into the next century?\r\nHow can any of us prevent the continued growth in\r\nthe number of emigrants from poor nations who flock to\r\nthe wealthy countries in pursuit of a dream, while the\r\ncurrent world order does not allow them to find the\r\nconditions for a decent life in their own countries?\r\nA small number of representatives in this hall\r\nrepresent countries that have no need to fear a military\r\nthreat in the coming century. Some even have nuclear\r\nweapons, belong to a powerful alliance or build up their\r\narmies every year with better, more sophisticated\r\nweapons. They are the ones who view the rest of the\r\nworld as merely the Euro-Atlantic periphery of the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, and therefore they will\r\nnever have to endure the devastation of massive bombings\r\nby invisible attackers acting under what has come to be\r\nknown as a new strategic concept of that aggressive\r\nmilitary organization.\r\nBut the vast majority of those of us gathered here\r\ntoday do not enjoy such security. We are troubled to see\r\nthat in a world dominated by a single military and\r\ntechnological Power, we are today less safe than during\r\nthe difficult years of the cold war.\r\nIf one day we wished to call upon the Security\r\nCouncil to discuss a situation that we viewed as a threat\r\nto one of our poor countries, does the Assembly think\r\nthat we would be heard? I fear that recent examples have\r\nproved otherwise.\r\nWhy is there no discussion in the Assembly about\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament, including nuclear\r\ndisarmament? Why is the issue limited to controlling\r\nsmall arms, which are necessary in a case such as that of\r\nCuba — a country attacked and under blockade for 40\r\nyears? Why is there no mention of the deadly laser-\r\nguided bombs, the depleted uranium missiles, or the\r\ncluster or graphite bombs used indiscriminately by the\r\nUnited States in bombing the civilian populations in\r\nKosovo?\r\nCould anyone claim that our children will inherit a\r\njust and secure world if we do not change the unfair and\r\nunequal standards that are currently used to measure\r\nissues of such key importance to our collective security?\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nMust we also accept the imposition of free market\r\nrules and the sacred law of supply and demand in the brutal\r\ncommerce of death? What is stopping the international\r\ncommunity from attempting, in a rational and coordinated\r\nmanner, to redirect a large part of the $780 billion currently\r\nused for military expenditures to promoting development in\r\nthe Third World countries?\r\nThat is why we so passionately defend respect for the\r\nprinciples of international law, which have guided relations\r\namong all of the world\u0027s countries for more than half a\r\ncentury. What would we have left to defend ourselves in\r\nthe future if we poor countries were no longer able to rely\r\non such principles as respect for sovereignty and self-\r\ndetermination, the sovereign equality of all States and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other nations? How\r\ncould we call on the international community to protest a\r\nthreat against one of our countries if those principles, which\r\nare today systematically and flagrantly violated, were to be\r\nstruck from the Charter of the United Nations?\r\nIn a unipolar world, attempts to impose notions such\r\nas the limitation of sovereignty, and humanitarian\r\nintervention, do not advance international security: they\r\npose a threat to the countries of the Third World, which\r\nhave neither powerful armies nor nuclear weapons. Such\r\nattempts must therefore be brought to an end: they violate\r\nthe letter and the spirit of the Charter.\r\nAt the same time, we believe it is necessary to defend\r\nthe United Nations, now more than ever. We defend the\r\nneed for its existence as much as we do the need to\r\ndemocratize it. The challenge facing us is that of reforming\r\nthe United Nations so that it serves the interests of all\r\nnations equally. We defend both the need for the existence\r\nof the Security Council and the need to make it more\r\ninclusive, democratic and transparent. Why not expand the\r\nnumber of permanent members? Why could not the Council\r\ninclude at least two or three new permanent members from\r\nLatin America, Africa and Asia? The membership now is\r\nthree times the number of countries which founded the\r\nUnited Nations in San Francisco in 1945, and the vast\r\nmajority of them — the Third World countries — do not\r\nhave a single permanent member to represent them.\r\nHowever, we do not defend the right of veto. We do\r\nnot believe that anyone should have it. But if it is not\r\npossible to eliminate it, we should at least attempt to ensure\r\nthat this prerogative is more evenly shared, and provide that\r\nall new permanent members have the right of veto. Why,\r\nif the right of veto cannot be eliminated now, is it not\r\nrestricted to votes on proposed measures under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter? As things stand at present, a single\r\ncountry can override the will of all the other United\r\nNations Members. And there is one country that has\r\nexercised its unlimited right to veto an infinite number of\r\ntimes: the United States. This is untenable.\r\nAt the United Nations, we must curb the attempt to\r\nimpose a single way of thinking on us by trying to make\r\nus believe that it is our way, or that it is superior to our\r\nrich diversity of cultures and models, or that it is more\r\nadvanced and modern than our multiplicity of identities.\r\nTo survive, we must resist being treated as merely the\r\nEuro-Atlantic periphery and oppose having labelled as\r\nglobal threats the problems that we face as consequences\r\nof colonialism: underdevelopment; the consumerism of\r\nthe wealthy countries; and even the results of their recent\r\nor current policies.\r\nHere in this Hall are the representatives of the Group\r\nof 7, whose countries have 685 million inhabitants and\r\neconomies with a combined gross domestic product of\r\n$20 trillion. Also present are the rest of us, who represent\r\nthe remaining 181 countries, with more than 5 billion\r\ninhabitants and economies with a combined gross\r\ndomestic product of barely $10 trillion. Yes, we are all\r\nequal under the Charter of the United Nations, but not in\r\nreal life.\r\nWhile rich countries have the transnational\r\ncorporations that control over one third of all of the\r\nworld\u0027s exports, we poor countries have the asphyxiating\r\nburden of external debt, which has risen to the level of $2\r\ntrillion and continues to grow, devouring almost 25 per\r\ncent of our export earnings just to service our debt. How\r\ncan development be possible under these conditions?\r\nWhile we speak insistently in this Hall of the need for a\r\nnew international financial architecture, our countries are\r\nbeing buffeted by the scourge of a system that allows the\r\ndaily occurrence of speculative transactions worth $3\r\ntrillion. That structure cannot be fixed; it is not a matter\r\nof remodelling it, but rather of demolishing it and\r\nrebuilding it anew.\r\nCan anyone explain the logic of this phantom\r\neconomy that produces nothing and is sustained by\r\nbuying and selling things that do not exist? Should we or\r\nshould we not demolish this chaotic financial system and\r\nbuild upon its ruins a system that favours production,\r\ntakes differences into account and stops forcing our\r\nbattered economies to endlessly pursue the impossible\r\nillusion of increasing financial reserves? Sooner or later,\r\nthose reserves evaporate in the course of the desperate\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nand unfair battle to defend our currencies from the strong\r\nand highly favoured currency of the anachronistic Bretton\r\nWoods accord, the sacrosanct dollar.\r\nWhen the history of these years is written, it will be\r\nvery difficult to explain how a single country was able to\r\naccumulate so many privileges and such absolute power.\r\nWhat will the economists of the next century say when they\r\nrealize that the United States was able to live with a current\r\naccount deficit that is already about $300 billion without\r\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) having imposed\r\neven one of the severe adjustment programmes that are\r\nimpoverishing the countries of the third world?\r\nWho will explain the fact that, thanks to the privilege\r\nof having the world\u0027s reserve currency, the Americans, save\r\nless and spend more than anyone else in the world? Will\r\nanyone tell them that in 1998 they were able to import\r\n$124 billion worth of cars and spend $8 billion in\r\ncosmetics, thanks in good measure to the fact that they\r\ncontrolled 17.8 per cent of the votes of the International\r\nMonetary Fund, which gives them a virtual right of veto?\r\nHow can we explain to the people of Tanzania, for\r\nexample, that while all of this was happening they had to\r\nspend nine times as much on servicing the foreign debt\r\nthan on primary health care, and four times as much as on\r\nprimary education?\r\nThe current international economic system is not only\r\nprofoundly unjust, but also absolutely unsustainable. An\r\neconomic system that destroys the environment cannot be\r\nsustained. The world\u0027s supply of drinking water today is 60\r\nper cent of what it was in 1970; and today there are 2.3\r\nbillion more human beings on the planet than there were\r\nback then. The same is happening with our forests. Could\r\nanyone in this Hall defend the proposition that such a pace\r\nof destruction can go on indefinitely?\r\nAn economic system based on the irrational\r\nconsumption patterns of the rich countries, which are later\r\nexported to our own countries through the mass media,\r\ncannot be sustained. Why not accept that it is possible to\r\nprovide a decent life to all the people of the planet with the\r\nresources that are within our reach and the degree of\r\ntechnological development we have achieved, through a\r\nrational and solidarity-based exploitation of all this\r\npotential?\r\nHow will they explain that the member countries of\r\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment, whose representatives I now address with all\r\ndue respect, have fallen so far behind as to provide less\r\nthan one third of their 1970 commitment to dedicate a\r\nminimum of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product\r\nto official development assistance?\r\nI asked a member of our delegation, a Deputy in our\r\nNational Assembly and a professed Christian, what the\r\nBible would say about such an unjust economic order. He\r\nresponded quickly with the words of a Prophet from the\r\nHoly Book:\r\n“Woe unto them that decree unrighteous\r\ndecrees, and that write grievousness which they have\r\nprescribed;\r\nTo turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take\r\naway the right from the poor of my people, that\r\nwidows may be their prey, and that they may rob\r\nthe fatherless!\r\nAnd what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in\r\nthe desolation which shall come from afar? to whom\r\nwill ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your\r\nglory?” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 10: 1-3)\r\nI know that many people in this Hall share these\r\nconcerns, and I also know that almost all of us are asking\r\nourselves the same question. Can the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) be spared from becoming a fiefdom\r\nof the United States and its allies, as the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank are today? Will we\r\ntruly succeed in making the World Trade Organization the\r\ndemocratic and transparent forum we need, or will the\r\npowerful interests of a minority be imposed to the\r\ndetriment of the silent majority, which is too divided,\r\nconfused and unsuspecting to understand the dangers of\r\na cold and dogmatic liberalization of world trade? Will\r\nthey remember that the vast majority of third world\r\ncountries, dependent on the export of a single agricultural\r\nproduct or a few spices, will be wiped out of world trade\r\nand crushed by the fierce competition of a few\r\ntransnational corporations? Should we or should we not\r\ntake these realities into account and accept the need to\r\nprotect the interests of the underdeveloped countries, if\r\nonly to guarantee their very survival?\r\nHow will we poor countries be able to compete if\r\nour professionals leave for the wealthy nations in pursuit\r\nof better opportunities; if we are not even allowed to keep\r\nour athletes and we must watch with sorrow as they\r\ncompete under another country\u0027s flag? How will we poor\r\nnations be able to compete economically if the 10 most\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\ndeveloped countries control 95 per cent of the patents\r\nissued in the last 20 years, and intellectual property, far\r\nfrom being liberalized, is ever more closely protected?\r\nTalking to us poor countries about trade through the\r\nInternet is almost a joke, when we know that 91 per cent of\r\nInternet users live in the member countries of the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\r\nWill we ever see a change in the current situation, in which\r\nthere are over 600 telephone lines for every 1,000 people\r\nin the United States, Sweden and Switzerland, yet only 1\r\ntelephone per 1,000 people in Cambodia, Chad and\r\nAfghanistan?\r\nAs part of this tragic depiction of the situation facing\r\nthe vast majority of countries in the world, I feel bound to\r\ntalk about my own country. The situation in Cuba is an\r\neloquent example, if ever there was one, of what should not\r\nbe done in terms of relations between powerful and small\r\nnations.\r\nFor more than 40 years, my people have been\r\nsubjected to a brutal policy of hostility and all kinds of\r\naggression imposed by the United States. High-level\r\nauthorities in that country have openly admitted that this\r\npolicy is aimed at destroying the political and economic\r\nsystem built by the Cuban people of their own free will and\r\nat restoring the neo-colonial power that the United States\r\nheld over Cuba and definitively lost on 1 January 1959,\r\nwith the triumph of the Cuban revolution.\r\nAs has been made clear by events, public statements\r\nby American spokespersons and by declassified secret\r\nUnited States documents, this policy of aggression has been\r\ncarried out through means that have ranged from political\r\nand diplomatic measures, propaganda campaigns, espionage\r\nand subversion, and fostering defection and illegal\r\nemigration, to acts of terrorism, sabotage and biological\r\nwarfare. This policy has also included the organization and\r\nsupport of armed groups; air and naval raids against our\r\nterritory; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the\r\nleader of our revolution; a military invasion by a mercenary\r\narmy; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear\r\nconflict, in October 1962; and finally, a brutal commercial\r\nand financial blockade and a ferocious economic war\r\nagainst my country that have now lasted 40 years.\r\nLet me set aside the economic aspects of this\r\naggression against Cuba and deal solely with the physical\r\naggression and acts of war carried out by the United States\r\nGovernment. Recently Cuban social organizations, on\r\nbehalf of the entire population of Cuba, filed a civil lawsuit\r\nagainst the United States Administration claiming\r\nreparation and compensation for loss and damages\r\nresulting from the deaths of 3,478 Cuban citizens and for\r\na further 2,099 survivors who have been left disabled as\r\na consequence of the covert plots and the “dirty war”\r\nwaged by the United States. The suit demands that the\r\nUnited States Government, which is responsible for these\r\nhuman losses and injuries, be sentenced to pay a total of\r\n$181.1 billion in reparation as a minimum symbolic\r\ncompensation for the loss of something that is clearly\r\nirreplaceable and priceless: the lives and physical well-\r\nbeing of the more than 5,500 Cuban citizens who have\r\nbeen victims of the United States\u0027 obsessive policy against\r\nCuba.\r\nAt the open and public trial, televised nationwide, at\r\nwhich this claim was considered, it was clearly proved\r\nthat the United States Government was directly\r\nresponsible for this continued aggression, and that the\r\nundeclared war against Cuba had constituted an official\r\nState policy enforced by no fewer than nine successive\r\nUnited States Administrations over the last 40 years.\r\nWhat will they tell their grandchildren, these leaders,\r\nofficials and agents of the United States Government\r\nwhose consciences are weighed down by the guilt of\r\nplanning and carrying out this “dirty war” against Cuba\r\nand by the moral burden of responsibility for the death of\r\nthousands of Cubans?\r\nCan we possibly allow an international system to\r\ncontinue into the next century that accords total impunity\r\nfor monstrous actions such as these, which have been\r\nsystematically and flagrantly perpetrated by a major\r\nPower?\r\nThe ferocious economic blockade that extends to\r\nevery facet of our country\u0027s foreign trade and financial\r\nrelations merits particular attention. This blockade, which\r\nhas lasted over 40 years, began to develop before the\r\ntriumph of the revolution. A secret United States\r\ndocument, declassified in 1991, reveals that on 23\r\nDecember 1958, at a National Security Council meeting\r\nattended by President Dwight Eisenhower at which the\r\nsituation in Cuba was discussed, the then-Director of the\r\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA), Allen Dulles,\r\ncategorically stated: “We must prevent a Castro victory”.\r\nThree days later, on 26 December, President\r\nEisenhower instructed the CIA that he did not wish the\r\nspecifics of covert operations against Cuba to be\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\npresented to the National Security Council. Everything had\r\nto be kept strictly secret.\r\nThe sudden and overwhelming triumph of the\r\nrevolutionary forces six days later did not give them time\r\nto prevent a Castro victory. The first United States assault\r\non the national economy took place on 1 January 1959,\r\nwhen those who had looted the public treasury fled for the\r\nUnited States, together with the perpetrators of the worst\r\nmassacres and abuses against the Cuban people.\r\nFive weeks after the triumph of the revolution,\r\neconomist Felipe Pazos, a professional man — well known\r\nand respected in United States Government circles — who\r\nhad been appointed by the revolutionary Government to\r\ntake over the management of the Cuban National Bank,\r\nannounced on 6 February that the former regime had\r\nembezzled or seized $424 million from the gold and dollar\r\nreserves that backed the Cuban peso. The New York Times\r\nsubsequently corroborated the report\u0027s claim concerning the\r\ntheft of the funds, which constituted the country\u0027s only\r\nreserves.\r\nThe spoils of this colossal theft ended up in United\r\nStates banks. Not a dime was returned to Cuba. The\r\nNational Bank immediately requested a modest quantity of\r\nfunds to deal with this highly critical situation. That request\r\nwas turned down.\r\nThe Agrarian Reform Act, enacted on 17 May 1959,\r\nwas aimed at providing food for the vast majority of our\r\nundernourished people and direct or indirect employment\r\nfor the large percentage of the population that was then\r\nunemployed. It was enacted when the word socialism had\r\nnot yet been spoken in Cuba; however, it provoked an\r\nextreme reaction in the United States, whose companies\r\nowned much of the best and most fertile land in Cuba.\r\nCuba\u0027s willingness, stipulated in the Act itself, to provide\r\nthe owners with deferred compensation paid out in\r\nreasonable and workable instalments was met with an\r\nimmediate demand from the United States Government for\r\nprompt, effective and full cash compensation. There was\r\nnothing in the public coffers with which to meet this\r\ndemand.\r\nA month later, on 24 June, at a meeting called by the\r\nState Department to consider options for action against\r\nCuba, the view was put forth that the United States should\r\ntake a very strong stance forthwith against the Act and its\r\nimplementation, and that the best way to achieve the\r\nnecessary results was through economic pressure. The\r\nelimination of the Cuban sugar cane quota from the United\r\nStates market was proposed. According to a declassified\r\ndocument, this would cause the sugar industry to suffer\r\nan abrupt and immediate decline, causing widespread\r\nhigher unemployment; the large numbers of people\r\nthereby forced out of work would begin to go hungry. At\r\nthat same meeting, Secretary of State Herter explicitly\r\ndescribed these proposals as measures of economic\r\nwarfare.\r\nIn a memorandum dated 6 April 1960, Mr. L. D.\r\nMallory, a senior State Department official, stated that:\r\n“The only foreseeable means of alienating internal\r\nsupport is through disenchantment and disaffection\r\nbased on economic dissatisfaction and hardship ...\r\nevery possible means should be undertaken promptly\r\nto weaken the economic life of Cuba”.\r\nHe suggested taking:\r\n“... a line of action which ... makes the greatest\r\ninroads in denying money and supplies to Cuba, to\r\ndecrease monetary and real wages, to bring about\r\nhunger, desperation and the overthrow of the\r\nGovernment.”\r\nOn 6 July of that same year, the United States\r\nadopted one of the measures proposed: the elimination of\r\nthe Cuban sugar quota. Never again would the United\r\nStates buy a single pound of sugar from Cuba. A market\r\nthat was established over the course of more than 100\r\nyears between the United States and Cuba, with Cuba\r\nguaranteeing the supply of this essential food product to\r\nthe United States and its allies during the first half of the\r\ncentury, including during the two World Wars from which\r\nthe United States emerged as the wealthiest, most\r\npowerful nation in the world, was wiped out in a second,\r\ndealing a cruel blow to the country\u0027s major source of\r\nemployment and wealth and depriving it of essential\r\nfunds for the food, medicine, fuel and raw materials\r\nneeded to ensure the material survival of our people.\r\nFrom that time on, successive economic measures\r\nagainst the Cuban people continued to accumulate until\r\nthey formed a absolute and total blockade, which went so\r\nfar as to prevent Cuba from importing even an aspirin\r\nproduced in the United States, or from exporting to that\r\ncountry a single flower grown in Cuba.\r\nThis complete blockade, cynically referred to in\r\nofficial terminology with the euphemistic and apparently\r\ninnocuous word “embargo”, has continued to intensify\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nover the past 40 years. At the most critical and difficult\r\ntime in our history, when the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\nRepublics and the socialist bloc collapsed, and with them\r\nthe basic markets and sources of supply that the country\r\ncould count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare\r\nwaged against an island only 90 miles from the United\r\nStates coast, they decided to be yet more unyielding in their\r\napproach to Cuba: with truly vulgar and repugnant\r\nopportunism, the blockade was intensified to the maximum.\r\nThe so-called Torricelli Act of 1992, among other\r\nrestrictive measures that greatly affected the maritime\r\ntransport of food and other commodities between Cuba and\r\nthe rest of the world, prohibited United States subsidiaries\r\nbased in third countries from trading with Cuba. This put\r\nan end to commercial operations that amounted to over\r\n$700 million in imports of foodstuffs and medicines from\r\nthose countries. This genocidal policy reached even more\r\ninfamous heights with the Helms-Burton Act, which\r\ncodified all previous administrative restrictions, expanded\r\nand tightened the blockade and established it in perpetuity.\r\nSubsequent to the passage of that law, and with the\r\naim of tightening even further the blockade against the\r\nCuban people, numerous amendments, introduced into bills\r\nof such urgency and length that many United States\r\nlawmakers did not even have time to read them, were\r\nadopted by show of hands in the United States Congress.\r\nThe Cuban-American terrorist mafia, which is closely\r\nlinked to the extreme right wing, has achieved its goal of\r\nchanging the blockade from an order from the executive\r\ninto rigorous and inflexible legislation. The genocide\r\nthereby became institutionalized.\r\nFollowing a 1997 study of the consequences of the\r\nblockade for health, the American Association for World\r\nHealth concluded that it violates the most basic\r\ninternational agreements and conventions governing human\r\nrights standards, including the United Nations Charter, the\r\nCharter of the Organization of American States and the\r\nGeneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian\r\nPersons in time of War. The Geneva Conventions, to which\r\nsome 165 countries, including the United States, are parties,\r\nrequire the free passage of all medical supplies and\r\nfoodstuffs intended for civilian use in time of war. The\r\nUnited States and Cuba are not at war. Indeed, their\r\nGovernments have even maintain diplomatic representation\r\nin Havana and Washington. However, the American\r\nAssociation for World Health has determined that the\r\nembargo\u0027s restrictions are a deliberate blockade of the\r\nCuban population\u0027s access to food and medicine in\r\npeacetime.\r\nIn the same report, the American Association for\r\nWorld Health expresses its belief that the United States\r\nembargo against Cuba has dramatically harmed the health\r\nand nutrition of a large number of ordinary Cuban\r\ncitizens and concludes that the embargo has significantly\r\nincreased suffering in Cuba, to the point of causing death.\r\nFor seven consecutive years, the Assembly has\r\nconsistently adopted a resolution on the need to end the\r\neconomic blockade imposed by the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America on the Cuban people. The\r\ncondemnation of that genocidal policy has visibly grown\r\nfrom year to year: year on year between 1992 and 1998,\r\nthe Cuban resolution against the blockade received 59, 88,\r\n101, 117, 137, 143 and 157 votes in favour, while the\r\nUnited States obtained only 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3 and 2 votes,\r\nincluding its own. Given the absolute contempt\r\ndemonstrated by the United States with regard to these\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, the people of Cuba have\r\ndecided, independently of the battle taking place in this\r\nAssembly, to resort to the legal procedures to which they\r\nare entitled in order to demand the appropriate sanctions\r\nagainst those responsible for such acts of genocide.\r\nCuba\u0027s initiative is based on a solid and irrefutable\r\nlegal foundation. The Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide was adopted by the\r\nAssembly on 9 December 1948 and signed by the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America on 11\r\nDecember 1948 and by the Republic of Cuba on 28\r\nDecember 1949. It entered into force on 12 January 1951\r\nand has been signed and ratified by 124 States. Article II\r\nof that Convention reads:\r\n“In the present Convention, genocide means any of\r\nthe following acts committed with intent to destroy,\r\nin whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or\r\nreligious group”.\r\nIn subparagraph (c), it immediately goes on to\r\ninclude, among these acts,\r\n“Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions\r\nof life calculated to bring about its physical\r\ndestruction in whole or in part”.\r\nArticle III stipulates that the following acts, among\r\nothers, shall be punishable: “(a) Genocide; ... (d) Attempt\r\nto commit genocide; (e) Complicity in genocide”. It\r\nexplicitly states in article IV that\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\n“Persons committing genocide or any of the other\r\nacts enumerated in article III shall be punished,\r\nwhether they are constitutionally responsible rulers,\r\npublic officials or private individuals”.\r\nThe Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of\r\nCivilian Persons in Time of War was signed on 12 August\r\n1949, and was ratified by the Governments of the United\r\nStates and Cuba; it entered into force on 21 October 1950.\r\nA total of 188 States are currently parties to the\r\nConvention. Article 23 decrees that\r\n“Each High Contracting Party shall allow the free\r\npassage of all consignments of medical and hospital\r\nstores and objects necessary for religious worship\r\nintended only for civilians of another High\r\nContracting Party, even if the latter is its adversary. It\r\nshall likewise permit the free passage of all\r\nconsignments of essential foodstuffs, clothing and\r\ntonics intended for children under fifteen, expectant\r\nmothers and maternity cases”.\r\nThe first Protocol Additional to that Convention\r\nspecifically, precisely and categorically stipulates, in its\r\narticle 54, entitled “Protection of objects indispensable to\r\nthe survival of the civilian population”, that\r\n“1. Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare\r\nis prohibited.\r\n“2. It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or\r\nrender useless objects indispensable to the survival of\r\nthe civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural\r\nareas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock,\r\ndrinking water installations and supplies and irrigation\r\nworks, for the specific purpose of denying them for\r\ntheir sustenance value to the civilian population or to\r\nthe adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in\r\norder to starve out civilians, to cause them to move\r\naway, or for any other motive”.\r\nArticle VII of the 1948 Convention on genocide states,\r\nwithout room for the slightest doubt, that\r\n“Persons charged with genocide or any of the\r\nother acts enumerated in article III shall be tried by a\r\ncompetent tribunal of the State in the territory of\r\nwhich the act was committed”.\r\nSubparagraph (e) of article III of that Convention\r\nstipulates with the same precision that accomplices to\r\ngenocide shall also be punished.\r\nAs a consequence, the National Assembly of\r\nPeople\u0027s Power of the Republic of Cuba declared on 13\r\nSeptember 1999: first, that the economic blockade\r\nimposed on Cuba by the Government of the United States\r\nconstitutes an international crime of genocide in\r\naccordance with the definition stipulated in the\r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the\r\nCrime of Genocide, adopted by the General Assembly on\r\n9 December 1948; second, that, on the basis of the\r\narguments put forward and of the foregoing statement, it\r\nproclaims Cuba\u0027s right to demand that such acts be\r\npunished; third, that as a result of the grave, systematic\r\nand ongoing genocide carried out over the course of 40\r\nyears against the people of Cuba, and in accordance with\r\ninternational standards, principles, agreements and laws,\r\nCuban courts have the right to try and punish the guilty\r\nparties, whether they be present or absent; fourth, that\r\nacts of genocide and other war crimes are not subject to\r\nany statute of limitations; fifth, that the guilty parties can\r\nbe punished even with a sentence of life imprisonment;\r\nsixth, that criminal responsibility does not exempt the\r\naggressor State from providing material compensation for\r\nthe human and economic damage it may have caused; and\r\nseventh, that it calls on the international community for\r\nsupport in this struggle to defend the most elementary\r\nprinciples of justice, the right to life, peace and the\r\nfreedom of all peoples.\r\nHere in this Hall today, as members of the Cuban\r\ndelegation to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession, there are three young Cubans representing our\r\ncountry\u0027s university students, secondary-school students,\r\nand children and adolescents. They are here on behalf of\r\nthe social organizations that went before the relevant\r\ncourts to file the claim against the United States\r\nGovernment, demanding reparations and compensation for\r\nthe damages and injuries suffered by thousands of people.\r\nThose same organizations also took the legal initiative of\r\nproposing to the National Assembly of People\u0027s Power the\r\nproclamation I have just cited.\r\nHere with us as well are three outstanding\r\npersonalities in Cuban medicine, Deputies in the National\r\nAssembly, who have testified before that body on the\r\ntragic harm that has resulted from the blockade on\r\nmedicines imposed against our country. There are also\r\nthree Christian deputies, whose profound ethical, religious\r\nand human convictions led them to support the\r\nproclamation made in our National Assembly demanding\r\nthe trial and punishment of the guilty parties.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nThese individuals are prepared to respond, here in the\r\nUnited States, to any questions posed to them, or to meet\r\nwith the press, academic institutions, non-governmental\r\norganizations, legislators, senators or even any committee\r\nof the United States Congress. We are prepared not only to\r\nmake accusations, but also to engage in debate and prove\r\nthe facts that support them.\r\nThe President: I call next on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kassymzhomart K. Tokaev.\r\nMr. Tokaev (Kazakhstan): Let me congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to the high office of President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We are\r\nconfident that under your able leadership we will be able to\r\naddress successfully the items on our agenda.\r\nPlease allow me also to convey our appreciation to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his considerable\r\ncontribution to the work of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-third session.\r\nWe pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his\r\nefforts to meet the unprecedented and complex challenges\r\nfacing the United Nations.\r\nOn the threshold of the third millennium — as at the\r\nbeginning of this century — the world community must\r\ndeal with substantive issues of war and peace. On the one\r\nhand, the process of globalization, which is unfolding\r\nbefore our eyes, has triggered a rich flow of ideas, capital,\r\ntechnologies, goods and services all around the world,\r\nhaving profoundly transformed our societies.\r\nPhilosophically, mankind has taken a big step forward\r\ntowards qualitatively new dimensions of existence.\r\nOn the other hand, the world continues to be rocked\r\nby conflicts rooted in causes that have become compounded\r\ndespite the advent of global technologies and\r\ncommunications. First among the causes of conflict is\r\nethnic, national and religious intolerance. It is absolutely\r\nunacceptable that this most dangerous virus is spreading\r\nrapidly throughout many regions of today\u0027s world, giving\r\nrise to terrorist acts and bloody conflicts. The danger is that\r\npeople affected by conflicts look for the sources of their\r\ntroubles among other nationalities and religions. As a result,\r\nwe face a vicious circle wherein death and desperation\r\nreign unchecked. We are confident that civilized society, by\r\npooling its resources, will eventually be able to break out\r\nof this vicious circle, having convinced people of the\r\nbenefits of a conflict-free existence. If we talk about the\r\nantagonism between war and peace, then we have every\r\nright to demand the use of means to enforcing a\r\nsustainable peace, including military means.\r\nAt the same time, it is impossible to ignore the fact\r\nthat the present world order is in desperate need of\r\nreliable measures to ensure balance between the essential\r\nelements of its support structures. Kazakhstan shares the\r\nview of those States which believe that in the next\r\ncentury the world should be multi-polar and free of\r\ncentres of power and dividing lines, confrontations and\r\nshowdowns, interference in the internal affairs of others\r\nand imposition of policy directives. Cooperation and\r\nmutual understanding, democracy and sustainable\r\ndevelopment will define the core of the coming world\r\norder.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations remains a unique\r\nintergovernmental institution that ensures a positive trend\r\nin the development of international relations. Kazakhstan\r\ncalls for a strengthening of the United Nations, the only\r\nforum that is universal both in terms of its composition\r\nand in terms of the comprehensiveness of its agenda.\r\nOnly the United Nations has the right to address\r\nfundamental issues of peace and security.\r\nThe Yugoslav crisis has clearly demonstrated how\r\nurgent the issue of strengthening the authority of the\r\nUnited Nations has become. We are becoming\r\nincreasingly convinced of the need to enhance the\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security and to make\r\nauthorization of certain actions its exclusive prerogative.\r\nThe nature of many conflicts makes this an\r\nespecially challenging task. That is why we believe that\r\nto be able to adapt to new political realities, the Security\r\nCouncil should enter the twenty-first century renewed and\r\nstrengthened through the admission of new permanent\r\nmembers, first of all Japan and Germany, as well as non-\r\npermanent members representing different regions of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe efforts to consolidate the international regime\r\nfor the non-proliferation of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and put in place effective controls over the\r\nproduction of fissile material remain at the centre of our\r\npolicy for achieving global security and stability.\r\nKazakhstan has made an important contribution to\r\nnon-proliferation and to putting an end to nuclear-weapon\r\ntesting. We consider the decision to admit Kazakhstan to\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nmembership of the Conference on Disarmament as adequate\r\nrecognition of our actions in this direction. Renunciation of\r\nnuclear weapons and accession to the Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nhave become natural choices for our country, which has felt\r\nthe full brunt of the harmful effects of nuclear testing.\r\nKazakhstan vigorously advocates further consolidation of\r\nthe non-proliferation regime, and supports the initiative to\r\nestablish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia.\r\nOur country has consistently called for the creation of\r\nsecurity structures in Asia. As is well known, at the\r\nAssembly\u0027s forty-seventh session, the President of\r\nKazakhstan, Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, put forward an\r\ninitiative to convene a Conference on Interaction and\r\nConfidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA). On 14\r\nSeptember, the opening day of the current General\r\nAssembly session, after seven years of negotiations and\r\ndiscussions, Almaty hosted the first meeting of the Foreign\r\nMinisters of the Asian States members of the Conference.\r\nGovernment officials responsible for foreign policy signed\r\na Declaration of Principles Guiding Relations between\r\nCICA Member States which confirmed the Asian States\u0027\r\nstrong commitment to and goodwill towards efforts to\r\nensure security and stability in the region.\r\nThus, for the first time in history, a legal foundation\r\nfor an Asian security system has been laid. It is difficult to\r\noverestimate the significance of this development in the\r\ncontext of the international community\u0027s efforts to\r\nstrengthen international security. We are talking here about\r\na region that is home to more than 3.5 billion people and\r\nthat accounts for more than 40 per cent of world trade.\r\nWe are grateful to all the States participating in the\r\nCICA process for their support for our initiative and for\r\ntheir genuine willingness to work together to build a\r\nsecurity system for Asia. I take this opportunity to express\r\nour appreciation to Secretary-General Annan, for his close\r\nattention to and support for the initiative by Kazakhstan.\r\nRecent political developments attest to how urgent the\r\nneed is to create a security system in Asia. I refer here to\r\nterrorist incursions in southern Kyrgyzstan and to terrorist\r\nacts in the Northern Caucasus in Russia.\r\nFrom the point of view of security in our region, we\r\nbelieve that the outcome of the latest summit of the\r\n“Shanghai Five” is very important. Its participants created\r\na mechanism of confidence providing for transparency in\r\nmilitary activity and reduction of those activities in border\r\nareas, settlement of border issues and a regular exchanges\r\nof information on military activities. The heads of the five\r\nStates believe that multipolarity reflects a general trend in\r\nthe development of the contemporary world and\r\ncontributes to the long-term stability of the international\r\nsituation.\r\nKazakhstan calls for a lasting and just peace in\r\nAfghanistan within the negotiation process, according to\r\nthe “six plus two” formula. At the same time, we believe\r\nthat the Afghan peace process should involve all the\r\nStates concerned. For this reason, Kazakhstan supports the\r\nproposal to convene a representative international\r\nconference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, on the settlement of\r\nthe conflict in Afghanistan.\r\nKazakhstan highly appreciates the United Nations\r\nefforts to promote the integration of the economies in\r\ntransition into the world economy. Our country counts on\r\ncontinued cooperation with the United Nations on the\r\nissues of consultative services and technical assistance.\r\nWe are firmly committed to the policy of deepening\r\nregional economic cooperation and actively using for this\r\npurpose the capacity of the United Nations. Our country\r\nis satisfied with its cooperation with the Economic\r\nCommission for Europe and the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific in the elaboration\r\nand implementation of the Special Programme for the\r\nEconomies of Central Asia.\r\nWe support the revival of the Silk Road.\r\nGeographically, Kazakhstan, along with other Central\r\nAsian States, plays the role of a bridge connecting the\r\ntwo continents. During the era of the Roman Empire trade\r\nroutes between Rome and Shanghai passed through the\r\nregion. The revival of the Silk Road will boost the\r\neconomic development of the Central Asian region.\r\nIn current conditions it is envisioned that the Silk\r\nRoad will be revived by building on three pillars: energy,\r\na transcontinental transportation system and\r\ntelecommunications. The thrust of this project — which\r\nreflects global, regional and local interests — is to\r\ndevelop the natural resources of the region, first of all its\r\nlarge oil and gas fields. One has to bear in mind,\r\nhowever, that no large-scale pipeline project can be\r\nrealized without the hydrocarbon resources of Kazakhstan.\r\nIn view of the increased competition in the world\r\nenergy-carriers markets, Kazakhstan is giving priority\r\nattention to the construction of oil and gas pipelines. The\r\nnorthern Caspian pipeline consortium project, scheduled\r\nfor completion in 2001, is a top priority for our country,\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nbecause when it is operational Kazakhstan will be able to\r\ndouble, at a minimum, both its oil production and its export\r\ndeliveries to foreign markets.\r\nWe pin many of our hopes on the development of the\r\nhydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea shelf. For this\r\nreason we believe that the issue of the legal status of this\r\nsea is of fundamental importance. Kazakhstan commends a\r\nbreakthrough agreement with Russia on the delimitation of\r\nthe seabed in the northern part of the Caspian Sea on the\r\nbasis of a modified median line.\r\nThe issues of sustainable development, environmental\r\nprotection and rehabilitation of ecological disaster areas\r\nhave become especially pressing at the end of this century,\r\nand demand immediate action. Kazakhstan is interested in\r\nthe mobilization of the international community to solve\r\nenvironmental problems, because it has disaster areas, such\r\nas the region of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing\r\nground, the dying Aral Sea and other zones. Our country,\r\nwhich suffers from desertification and floods, is also\r\ndirectly affected by global climate changes.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of Kazakhstan, I would\r\nlike to express our great appreciation to the States\r\nconcerned for their support for the efforts to overcome the\r\nserious social, ecological and humanitarian problems of the\r\nSemipalatinsk region. The adoption of two General\r\nAssembly resolutions on international cooperation and\r\ncoordination for the human and ecological rehabilitation and\r\neconomic development of the Semipalatinsk region has\r\nundoubtedly contributed to an interest in and reflection on\r\nthe outstanding issues.\r\nSpecial words of appreciation are due to the\r\nGovernment of Japan and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) for sponsoring an international\r\nconference convened at the beginning of September in\r\nTokyo. The outcome of this representative forum\r\nreverberated throughout our country. We consider this\r\nconference a practical contribution by the Government of\r\nJapan and the UNDP to the implementation of the relevant\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. In this regard, I cannot miss\r\nthis opportunity to recognize important work by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations\r\nChildren\u0027s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund and\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, as well as by the donor countries that acted\r\nas cosponsors of the conference.\r\nKazakhstan is taking concrete steps to democratize its\r\nsociety and to deepen its political reforms. Kazakhstan\u0027s\r\nhead of State has introduced a programme that covers\r\nsuch important areas as elections, political parties, the\r\nParliament, the judicial system, the status of women and\r\nthe mass media. Earlier this year the first open and\r\ncontested presidential elections were held in Kazakhstan.\r\nThe refinement of the election process continues.\r\nThe law on elections has been amended to reflect the\r\nrecommendations of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe. Its provisions will be used in the\r\nparliamentary elections scheduled for this October. The\r\nelection process is becoming more representative,\r\nencouraging active involvement of candidates and voters.\r\nA programme of phased transition to holding elections for\r\nlocal and regional governments is being developed. The\r\nrole of non-governmental organizations, an important\r\nelement of a civil society, is being enhanced. The judicial\r\nsystem and the mass media are steadily becoming more\r\nindependent.\r\nAchieving an open society, with a market economy,\r\nis the course for Kazakhstan\u0027s further development. The\r\nprocess of democratization in our country is gaining\r\nmomentum and has become irreversible.\r\nAlong with political reforms, Kazakhstan is taking\r\nvigorous actions to protect the long-term interests of\r\nforeign investors. Our objective is to ensure — through\r\nthe creation of a favourable investment climate in the\r\ncountry — its full integration into the world economic\r\nsystem of today.\r\nKazakhstan expresses support for the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to reform the Organization in order to\r\nenhance its effectiveness and capability to respond\r\nadequately to emerging problems and challenges. We\r\nbelieve that concrete results in the renewal of the\r\nOrganization can be achieved only through joint efforts of\r\nall Member States. That is why all States should continue\r\ntheir coordinated efforts to strengthen the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the promotion of global stability and\r\nsecurity in the next century.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Singapore, His Excellency\r\nMr. Shunmugam Jayakumar.\r\nMr. Jayakumar (Singapore): First let convey my\r\nwarmest congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your\r\nelection. As we enter the new millennium, the United\r\nNations is crossing a significant threshold, and we need\r\na seasoned hand to lead us. Your long experience with the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nUnited Nations, first as a freedom fighter, now as Foreign\r\nMinister of Namibia, will stand us in good stead.\r\nLet me also thank your distinguished predecessor,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for the good work he did\r\nlast year.\r\nAs a fellow small State, Singapore would also like to\r\nwarmly welcome the three new Members to the United\r\nNations: Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga. We hope that they will\r\nalso join the forum of small States.\r\nI wish to pose this question: Will the United Nations\r\nsurvive in the twenty-first century? I have framed this\r\nquestion provocatively because I believe that the United\r\nNations has not yet adequately come to grips with the\r\ncentral challenges of its next phase of development. Unless\r\nit does so, my question may not be just rhetorical.\r\nMr. Ingólfsson (Iceland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nTo be sure, the United Nations has been seized of\r\nefforts at reform for several years. But what is required\r\nmust go beyond the modification of existing institutions or\r\norganizational structures. The issue is not just how to make\r\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council, the Secretariat\r\nor other organs work more effectively, although that is\r\nimportant. But we cannot succeed if we neglect the broader\r\ncontext of such endeavours. The key question is whether\r\nthe current United Nations is conceptually and\r\nconstitutionally sound.\r\nThe simple but hard-won lesson of this century\u0027s\r\nexperiments with international organizations, from the\r\nLeague to the United Nations, is that the United Nations\r\nmust work within the framework of the state system. If the\r\nUnited Nations has worked better or has lasted longer than\r\nthe League, it is because the United Nations has\r\naccommodated the state system rather than posed a direct\r\nthreat to it. Its Member States see the United Nations as an\r\nadditional protective umbrella, not as a body that\r\ndiminishes them.\r\nThe League\u0027s Covenant was based on different\r\npremises. It emphasized disarmament. It promoted\r\ncollective security. It required States to submit disputes to\r\narbitration and judicial settlement. By doing so, the League\r\nposed an explicit challenge to the rights of States. On the\r\nother hand, the United Nations can do nothing that its\r\nMembers do not expressly allow it to do. Our Charter is\r\nclear and explicit that the United Nations is based on the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of its Members. It also\r\nstresses the concomitant principle of non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs.\r\nBut these premises are now under pressure. As the\r\ntwentieth century draws to a close, the state system is on\r\nthe verge of major transformation. This will profoundly\r\naffect all Members and the United Nations itself.\r\nI do not predict the end of the nation State. The\r\nconcept of sovereignty is undergoing profound\r\nmodification, but it does not seem likely that the nation\r\nState will simply disappear. No viable alternative to\r\norganizing international political life has yet emerged, no\r\nmatter how inadequate or ineffective the current form\r\nmay have become. Radical proposals for restructuring the\r\nframework of the state system will inevitably invite\r\ndisappointment. The United Nations must therefore work\r\nwithin the existing framework, even as that framework is\r\nbeing transformed. Herein lie the subtlety and the\r\ndifficulty of the new challenge.\r\nTwo forces are impelling change: the pressures of a\r\ntruly integrated world economy and the end of the cold\r\nwar. Neither is adequately understood; even less\r\nunderstood is their interplay. This dialectic simultaneously\r\nimpels an unprecedented degree of international\r\ncooperation and makes international cooperation more\r\ndifficult to achieve.\r\nThere have always been issues which required States\r\nto work together. Interdependence is not new. In a sense,\r\nit is as old as the state system. To be sure, the number\r\nand scope of transnational issues that require international\r\ncooperative action have now expanded, but this is a\r\nchange of degree, not of kind. Globalization is not just\r\nmore interdependence.\r\nWhile globalization\u0027s effects are most evident in\r\nfinance and economics, there are far-reaching implications\r\nacross a range of issues. It affects the very notion of\r\nstatehood and government as they have hitherto been\r\nunderstood.\r\nThe essential function of any Government is to\r\ngovern — to provide public goods and services to its\r\ncitizens within its borders. But in a globalized economy,\r\nnational borders no longer include sufficient territory to\r\nfunction as self-contained economic units. Financial\r\ngeography and economic geography no longer coincide\r\nwith political geography. This mismatch means that\r\nGovernments no longer have a monopoly of legitimate\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\npower within their own state boundaries. This does not\r\nchallenge the de jure sovereignty of States, but profoundly\r\nalters every Government\u0027s de facto capacity to govern.\r\nThe challenge is not, as it was throughout history,\r\nmerely of one State circumscribing the sovereignty of\r\nanother — of the powerful forcing their will on the weak.\r\nThe real challenge is now within each State, no matter how\r\npowerful.\r\nDealing with this phenomenon poses a different kind\r\nof challenge than just insisting on the legal concept of\r\nsovereignty or persuading Governments to work together on\r\nspecific issues. It forces a reconceptualization of the very\r\nidea of government and statehood. It requires a complete\r\nchange of mindset by the powerful as well as by the weak.\r\nThis will be difficult and painful to achieve.\r\nWhat is required is an unprecedented and qualitatively\r\nnew kind of international cooperation, not just cooperation\r\nbased on the alignment of national interests, as has occurred\r\nthroughout history. It requires the redefinition of what\r\nconstitutes both “nation” and “interests”. States can no\r\nlonger just collide or cooperate at the boundaries of their\r\nsovereignties. It demands nothing less than shared\r\nresponsibility for governance and a pooling of\r\nsovereignties.\r\nFor this new kind of international cooperation to be\r\nconstructed and take root, the imperative of cooperation\r\nmust be supported by practical experience that demonstrates\r\nthat it is superior to any other political alternative. It is here\r\nthat the intersection and interplay of globalization and the\r\npost-cold-war international order complicate matters.\r\nThe end of the cold war at first seemed to promise a\r\nnew dawn for the United Nations, opening up vast\r\npotentialities for international cooperation unfettered by\r\nideological conflict. But these hopes have now been dashed.\r\nIn reality, the end of the cold war may have made\r\ninternational cooperation less likely.\r\nParadoxically, the ever-greater integration of the world\r\neconomy has been accompanied by increasing political\r\nfragmentation. The cold war was not just an ideological\r\ngeopolitical struggle; the cold war imposed identities that\r\ntranscended nationalism. Even those who sought to escape\r\nthe cold war in fact defined themselves in relation to it.\r\nIrrespective of which side we stood for, the cold war was\r\nthe organizing principle for international action and the\r\nconcept by which we understood global events.\r\nTo those disoriented by the pressures of\r\nglobalization, the end of the cold war provided an\r\nopportunity to seek reassurance and a new identity in real\r\nor imagined ethnic nationalisms. The resulting\r\nproliferation of States and the lack of a clear organizing\r\nprinciple for international action have made cooperation\r\nproblematic.\r\nThe end of ideological conflict and the increasing\r\ninfluence of market principles in all areas of life are\r\nmaking economic efficiency an essential condition for\r\nevaluating political actions. But globalization has\r\nsimultaneously eroded the ability of States to muster the\r\npolitical consensus of their own citizens for such action.\r\nIt is therefore not very surprising that the right kind of\r\nnew response has not yet been forthcoming.\r\nOf course, lip service is being paid to the need for\r\nnew international institutions to deal with new\r\ntransnational problems or to the reform of existing\r\ninternational institutions, the United Nations among them.\r\nBut the more usual reaction to the mismatch between\r\neconomic geography and the political geography of state\r\nboundaries has been defensive or a sterile triumphalism:\r\na new protectionism, xenophobic or nostalgic nationalisms\r\nor, where a country feels strong and confident enough, a\r\nnew kind of extraterritoriality, reminiscent of the\r\nnineteenth century. Strong States try to project their\r\nnational laws beyond their boundaries or insist on their\r\nstandards as conditionalities for trade and other kinds of\r\ncooperative interactions.\r\nThe recognition that problems are global, and the\r\nalmost universal acceptance of the market, commands at\r\nbest only superficial international consensus. The real\r\nresponses, the most concrete and practical responses, have\r\nbeen regional rather than universal.\r\nThis process is most advanced in Europe and North\r\nAmerica, through the European Union and the North\r\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, and less so in Latin\r\nAmerica and Asia, through the Southern Cone Common\r\nMarket, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\r\nand the Association of South-East Asian Nations Free\r\nTrade Area. Tentative linkages are being explored\r\nbetween regions. Africa has been only peripherally\r\nengaged. But relying on regionalism as more than a\r\nstopgap in a globalized world creates a latent instability.\r\nIf projected unchecked into the twenty-first century, this\r\nmust ultimately affect basic issues of war and peace. It is\r\nobviously unacceptable for an entire continent to be\r\nmarginalized.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nSo a truly universal approach to shared responsibility\r\nfor global governance and pooling of sovereignties to deal\r\nwith global problems requires an international consensus on\r\nwhat is legitimately in the general interest of still sovereign\r\nStates. No matter how compelling the issue or problem, this\r\nis not self-evident.\r\nThe definition of what is in the legitimate public\r\ninterest within a specific State or nation is the product of a\r\nlong historical process, cultural attributes and a level of\r\neconomic development. It is the basic stuff of most political\r\ncontests in most States. Consensus is not easy to reach\r\ndomestically. It certainly will be even more difficult in an\r\ninternational system that is concurrently united and divided\r\nby globalization and the end of the cold war.\r\nThe international problem is compounded because the\r\nexpectation that the post-cold-war international system\r\nwould be multipolar has proved premature. A multipolar\r\nworld is still more a matter of potential rather than a\r\ncurrent reality. This has engendered discomfort.\r\nThe war in Kosovo focused such feelings. It threw\r\ninto brutal relief a trend that has been under way for some\r\ntime: that the absolute sovereignty of States has to be\r\nqualified to require compliance with generally accepted\r\nstandards of conduct and respect for human rights.\r\nThis is not all that novel a notion. The traditional\r\napproach of non-interference in domestic affairs was never\r\nas absolute in practice as in theory. The doctrine of\r\nhumanitarian intervention dates from the nineteenth century,\r\nwhen the powerful claimed the right to intervene in the\r\naffairs of the weak. The war in Kosovo resonated with such\r\nhistorical memories, thus adding to the discomfort.\r\nIt is a fact that sovereignty now coexists uneasily with\r\na different current of international law concerned with the\r\nrights of individuals. These trends have not yet been\r\nreconciled. But both trends are facts that cannot be wished\r\naway. In any case, their logical compatibility is not the real\r\nissue.\r\nNotwithstanding Kosovo, it does not appear that the\r\nmajority of States have much to fear if they treat their\r\ncitizens well. There are many countries that treat their\r\ncitizens badly without any suggestion of any sanction\r\nharsher than moral disapproval. Concern for human rights\r\nhas always been selective.\r\nThe more critical issue is related but different. The\r\nloss of territorial reference points engendered by\r\nglobalization\u0027s mismatch between economic and political\r\ngeographies and the loss of strategic meaning after the\r\nend of the cold war have made most international\r\nreactions ad hoc.\r\nWe lurch from crisis to crisis, with no clear sense of\r\ndirection or consistency. Why Kosovo or East Timor and\r\nnot Africa? Are the rights of humans everywhere not\r\nuniversal? How to choose when to intervene among the\r\nall-too-many conflicts? In his statement to the General\r\nAssembly this year, the Secretary-General has posed\r\nseveral thoughtful challenges for us: “Nothing in the\r\nCharter precludes a recognition that there are rights\r\nbeyond borders.” What the Charter does say is that armed\r\nforce shall not be used, save in the common interest. The\r\nSecretary-General then asked, what is the common\r\ninterest? Who shall define it? Who will defend it? Under\r\nwhose authority? With what means of intervention?\r\nI agree with the Secretary-General that these\r\nquestions will need to be answered and criteria\r\nestablished. Rules and objective criteria for such\r\ninterventions are urgently needed. Failure to do so will\r\nbreed uncertainty and instability. If a new balance has to\r\nbe struck between sovereignty and other values, it should\r\nbe struck knowingly and with our eyes open. The\r\nalternative is to be led, one step at a time, with the best\r\nof intentions, by ad hoc solutions.\r\nThis will be a major challenge for the international\r\ncommunity if the United Nations is to remain relevant in\r\nthe coming century. This is because we can expect to face\r\nmany more situations which will pose the dilemma of\r\nreconciling State sovereignty with international\r\nintervention to redress violations of human rights.\r\nWe are all familiar with the pressures of the\r\ninternational media and non-governmental actors. These\r\nare realities but provide no satisfactory answers. It is not\r\npolitically acceptable that questions of international peace\r\nand stability should be decided on an ad hoc basis. It is\r\neven less acceptable that consensus on the need for more\r\npeaceful modes of international cooperation should reflect\r\nthe preoccupations of a few.\r\nWhat we need is to replicate on a global scale those\r\nconditions that have made the pluralistic societies in\r\nadvanced economies still capable of collective action. No\r\nGovernment anywhere can rule by coercion alone or lead\r\nlegitimately merely because it wields supreme power.\r\nResort to coercion or naked power is more often than not\r\ntaken to be a symptom of failure of government and not\r\nits defining feature.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nWhat is required, therefore, on the international stage\r\nis what has already been accepted domestically — indeed,\r\ninsisted upon in the name of democracy: a modest\r\nacceptance of the reality of diversity and a nuanced\r\nappreciation of the difference between friends, friendly\r\ncritics and honest disagreements. Persuading those already\r\ndisoriented by globalization and rapid technological changes\r\nrequires patient and skilful diplomacy in the artful balance\r\nof competing interests.\r\nDespite the handicaps under which it laboured, and for\r\nall its imperfections, the United Nations has played a\r\ncritical role in some of the great world issues of the first\r\nfour decades of its existence. It eased the pangs of\r\ndecolonization. It provided a cathartic theatre to vent the\r\nmost dangerous passions of the cold war. It provided the\r\nmeans for the super-Powers to back down from unwanted\r\nconfrontations without grievous political costs to either.\r\nFrom time to time, it scored notable successes in\r\npeacekeeping operations around the world. At the same\r\ntime, the United Nations, through its specialized agencies,\r\ncontinues to play a vital developmental role for the majority\r\nof its Members.\r\nBut the United Nations experiences of the last decade\r\nhave been less happy. The United Nations has played at\r\nbest only a very marginal role in the great developments of\r\nthe closing years of the twentieth century that I have tried\r\nto describe. It risks becoming increasingly divorced from\r\nthe very international realities in which it is inescapably\r\nembedded.\r\nLike all organizations of sovereign States, the United\r\nNations can only provide a mechanism for its Members to\r\nuse for whatever purpose their agreements or disagreements\r\ndictate. But the United Nations cannot be just a tool of the\r\nfew, a repository for issues that no country is willing or\r\nknows how to confront, or a convenient scapegoat. The\r\nhard fact is that these are the roles that the United Nations\r\nhas been forced to play in recent years. It cannot continue\r\non this path without permanent damage.\r\nIn our century, the trend towards international\r\norganization, towards the development of a more\r\npredictable pattern of relationships between States and\r\ninternational regimes that transcend individual sovereignties\r\nis, I believe, established. There is no going back. Whether\r\nwe like it or not, the world has become too complex to be\r\ndealt with except multilaterally.\r\nBut this does not mean that any particular international\r\ninstitution will necessarily play an effective role in the\r\norganization of international life in the next century. The\r\nUnited Nations cannot assume that it will survive intact,\r\njust by clinging on to structures and processes conceived\r\nin 1945. The world has changed dramatically since then.\r\nIt will continue to do so. The United Nations has no\r\nchoice but to change in tandem.\r\nThis imperative is clear. What is unclear is how the\r\nUnited Nations should change. That is why I have posed\r\nmore questions than I have provided answers. The process\r\nof discussion must start now. The mechanism is at our\r\ndisposal. The responsibility to use it is ours. Whether we\r\nwill engage ourselves in this responsibility quickly\r\nenough to make a difference to the United Nations is for\r\nus to choose. I do not know how much time we have. I\r\nonly know that the time left is finite.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Iraq, His Excellency\r\nMr. Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf.\r\nMr. Al-Sahaf (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): First of all,\r\nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. I am fully confident that your experience and\r\ncompetence will contribute to the success of this session.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, there was a feeling\r\nthat the world would see balanced international relations,\r\ncharacterized by peace, stability and well-being. But the\r\nstate of affairs has proved otherwise; the international\r\nimbalance continues and is being used to place the logic\r\nof hegemony above all else in order to perpetuate it in the\r\nworld and its international organizations, particularly the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nBecause of this situation, the world has witnessed a\r\nseries of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to\r\nthe emergence of many areas of political and military\r\nconflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the\r\nhuman, economic and social conditions of many regions\r\nin the world. These conflicts have claimed the lives of\r\nhundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and have\r\ncaused the huge squandering of material and human\r\nresources.\r\nThe world will enter the new century in this fashion.\r\nThe picture before us demonstrates the tyranny of force,\r\nthe imposition of hegemony and the aggravating\r\neconomic problems by which the States of the South are\r\nincreasingly marginalized to the extent that their entities\r\nand elements of survival are about to be eliminated. This\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nwill lead to economic subordination, inevitably followed by\r\npolitical subordination. In this context, there has emerged\r\na new phenomenon of imposing various kinds of embargoes\r\nand economic sanctions, withholding development and\r\ndepriving States of the exercise of their economic rights as\r\nenshrined in international law and covenants. The\r\ncatastrophic effects of this imbalance are reflected in the\r\nsocial conditions of many regions in the world. These\r\neffects are demonstrated by an increase in the intensity of\r\npoverty, the spread of illiteracy, deterioration of the health\r\nsituation and degradation of living standards. It can also be\r\nseen in the marginalization of many social segments of\r\nsociety, especially youth, because of lack of jobs; the same\r\ngoes for the increase in crime and the prevalence of drugs,\r\nas well as other serious social problems which can hardly\r\nbe controlled.\r\nIt is no secret that one of the main reasons for the\r\naggravation of this situation is the arbitrary imposition of\r\ncomprehensive sanctions and embargoes on many States in\r\nthe world for political purposes, without any sound\r\nfoundation in international law. It is obvious that this policy\r\nhas resulted in tragic effects on the economic and social\r\nstructures of the targeted States and on third countries. It\r\nconstitutes a flagrant violation of the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the principles\r\nof justice.\r\nThe most dangerous phenomenon witnessed during the\r\npresent decade, which in the course of this session has\r\nbecome an endeavour orchestrated by a group of Western\r\nStates, is the advocacy of so-called humanitarian\r\nintervention. This doctrine, which has no place in\r\ninternational law, stems from an organized infringement of\r\nthe most fundamental rules of the present international\r\norder, such as sovereignty, political independence, territorial\r\nintegrity and non-interference in internal affairs. These\r\nprinciples cannot provide a protective shield for grave\r\nviolations of human rights or for intervention, sometimes\r\nwith the use of force, in order to protect those rights. No\r\none should be deceived by this doctrine as the new\r\nframework for a modern forum of neo-colonialism based on\r\nthe logic of power.\r\nFirst of all, we should realize that no situation used as\r\na justification for this doctrine is free from the external\r\npolitical interventions that led in the first place to the\r\nemergence of such a situation. Accordingly, it could not be\r\nclaimed that international responsibility for the situation\r\nrests exclusively with the targeted Government. On the\r\nother hand, we should also realize that the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the\r\nmechanisms of the Organization are not devoid of\r\nmodalities to deal with any situation of the type advanced\r\nto justify this doctrine.\r\nThe problem does not lie with the principles, rules\r\nand procedures. Rather, it rests with the selfish and\r\nunilateral policies of the controlling Powers, whose\r\ninterests cannot be served by using the United Nations\r\nmechanisms established for the correct application of the\r\nprinciples and rules of the Charter, which reflect the joint\r\nwill and collective interests of the members of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe logic of this Western doctrine is not unknown\r\nto Iraq. At an early date, President Saddam Hussein drew\r\nattention to the dangers of the policy of might and\r\nopportunism in international relations that is carried out\r\nat the expense of the balance between rights and\r\nobligations and joint responsibility, as reflected in the\r\nCharter and in international law.\r\nIt is not justifiable to consider the role of the United\r\nNations as marginalized after it has become captive to the\r\nviews of the controlling Powers in international relations\r\nand their selfish interests. Regardless of what the Charter\r\nprovides in terms of rights, duties and procedures, we are\r\nconvinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarian\r\nintervention represents a dangerous destructive tool that\r\naffects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts in\r\nfavour of the general international interest, as evidenced\r\nby the records of this Organization. The universalization\r\nof the concepts of this doctrine would mean the complete\r\ndenial of the will of the vast majority of States, with the\r\nresult of destroying the present international order. Iraq\r\njoins all delegations which have declared a position\r\ncontrary to this Western doctrine. We call for joint efforts\r\nto confront it.\r\nI wish here to refer to a live example of the logic of\r\npower experienced in Iraq in 1998, at around this time of\r\nyear, when the Security Council was discussing the\r\narrangements for conducting a comprehensive review of\r\nthe implementation by Iraq of its obligations under\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, especially those relating to\r\ndisarmament, with a view to considering the lifting of the\r\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq since August\r\n1990. While the Security Council was convened to\r\ndiscuss the Secretary-General\u0027s report on Iraq\u0027s\r\ncooperation in the field of disarmament, the United States\r\nand British forces stationed in the Gulf region launched\r\na large-scale military aggression against Iraq, from 16\r\nDecember through 20 December 1998, using the lies and\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nfabrications of Richard Butler as a pretext for their\r\naggression. That aggression claimed the lives of a large\r\nnumber of innocent civilians, in addition to destroying\r\nmany infrastructure sites, as well as much industrial\r\nequipment which had already been subject to a strict\r\nmonitoring system established by the former Special\r\nCommission, which did not detect any violation of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions at those sites.\r\nIn spite of this gross violation of the Charter and\r\nmechanisms of the Organization, the Security Council, the\r\nmain organ concerned with the situation, remained\r\ncompletely crippled and did not take any immediate\r\ncollective action. The international condemnation of the\r\nAmerican/British aggression against Iraq last December did\r\nnot come from the Security Council. Rather, it came from\r\nGovernments and peoples of Member States on a larger\r\nscale after a noticeable lull. As the Assembly will recall,\r\nthe Security Council was preoccupied with a bare-faced\r\nprocess for gaining time through mandating panels to assess\r\nthe special situation concerning Iraq\u0027s implementation of its\r\nobligations under the resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nThose panels began their work unilaterally, without\r\nany advanced consultation with the Government of Iraq and\r\nwithout listening to its point of view. This process resulted\r\nin reports reflecting the political balance within the Security\r\nCouncil, which distanced it from the real substance of the\r\nsituation. At that point the process reached the stage of the\r\npresentation of draft resolutions ignoring the rights and\r\nobligations provided for in the resolutions of the Council\r\nitself. In fact, those draft resolutions added new obligations\r\nfor Iraq, not contained in the relevant resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council that Iraq had already implemented.\r\nWhile the Security Council resolutions imposed\r\nvarious obligations on Iraq, they in turn imposed a specific\r\nobligation on the Security Council, stipulating that the\r\ncomprehensive embargo was to be lifted once Iraq fulfilled\r\nits obligations under the same resolutions. But what has\r\nhappened in the course of the last nine years is that the\r\nCouncil, during 40 sessions held to review Iraq\u0027s\r\nimplementation of its obligations, has failed to take a\r\ndecision to lift the comprehensive embargo, much less to\r\nease the situation even by 1 per cent, despite the fact that\r\nall countries, even Iraq\u0027s enemies — for example, the\r\nUnited States of America — have attested that after nine\r\nyears of intensive implementation under the severest\r\ncircumstances and threats of continued aggression against\r\nIraq nothing important has been left unfulfilled.\r\nWhy then has the Council failed to lift the embargo\r\non Iraq? The reason behind all this is the American\r\nhegemony over the Council, which prevents the Council\r\nthrough various means from properly implementing its\r\nresolutions. We have seen for several months intensive\r\nendeavours in the Security Council, particularly by the\r\nfive permanent members, to adopt a unified position on\r\nIraq.\r\nThe correct position that conforms with the\r\nresolutions of the Security Council is very clear and\r\nuncontroversial. Once the logic of law and justice is\r\nadhered to, Iraq demands its clear and legitimate rights —\r\nnamely, the lifting of the iniquitous sanctions imposed on\r\nit in accordance with the Council\u0027s resolutions. These\r\nresolutions were agreed upon by the five permanent\r\nmembers and have been implemented by Iraq over the\r\nlast nine years. Now it is the turn of those five States to\r\nhonour their obligations. Iraq\u0027s position should be clear to\r\nall. To gain Iraq\u0027s approval, any proposal or resolution —\r\nor consequences, if there are any — should be based on\r\ninternational law and non-selectivity, otherwise the results\r\nwill meet with a definite rejection and we will continue\r\nour struggle to lift the sanctions comprehensively and\r\nfinally in order to achieve all our legitimate demands.\r\nIt has become clear to all, through public, personal\r\nand official testimonies, that the former Special\r\nCommission — a panel unfortunately bearing the name of\r\nthe United Nations and acting nominally under its flag —\r\nhas been used by the United States and Great Britain to\r\nachieve their aggressive objectives against Iraq\u0027s people,\r\nsovereignty and security. In order to achieve the ultimate\r\nend of its main mission, the former Special Commission\r\nhad adopted two methods for its work in Iraq: first,\r\nconducting espionage activities for American, British and\r\nIsraeli intelligence so as to enable them to realize their\r\nobjectives of destabilizing Iraq politically and removing\r\nits patriotic regime; and, secondly,keeping the embargo in\r\nplace by reporting to the Security Council that the Special\r\nCommission had not yet fulfilled its mandate of disarming\r\nIraq.\r\nDuring its work in Iraq, the former Special\r\nCommission resorted to dubious methods to falsify facts\r\nand present them in a manner that was in line with the\r\nAmerican approach, which is hostile to Iraq. The last of\r\nthese had to do with the issue of VX vials found in the\r\nCommission\u0027s headquarters at Baghdad. Those samples\r\nwere used by the Commission to contaminate the missing\r\nwarheads that were sent to American laboratories for\r\nanalysis. That was in order to enable the United States\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nAdministration to find evidence supporting its allegations\r\nregarding Iraq\u0027s weapons programmes. The Commission\u0027s\r\ndubious practices were not limited to this, but went as far\r\nas hastily destroying the VX samples in order to conceal\r\nthe irrefutable evidence of the Commission\u0027s involvement\r\nin the American conspiracy against Iraq.\r\nThe American attempts to distort and pervert the\r\nrelationship between Iraq and the Security Council have not\r\nbeen limited to exploiting the former Special Commission.\r\nThey reached their ugliest forms in the open obstruction of\r\nany efforts to ease the effects of the comprehensive\r\nembargo imposed on Iraq, which has resulted in bitter\r\nsuffering for the people of Iraq, particularly its children.\r\nThe obstacles experienced during the implementation\r\nof the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq\r\nand the United Nations regarding the oil-for-food\r\nformula — which all reports and realities indicate cannot\r\nmeet the essential humanitarian needs of the people of\r\nIraq — are striking evidence of the American\r\nAdministration\u0027s insistence on harming the people of Iraq\r\nand depriving them of their fundamental humanitarian\r\nrights, as enshrined in all international covenants.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the total value of the\r\nsupplies that arrived in Iraq for the five initial phases of the\r\nimplementation of the Memorandum of Understanding is\r\nalmost equal to the funds deducted from the revenues of\r\nIraqi oil sales to cover the expenses of the Special\r\nCommission, the expenses of the United Nations in Iraq\r\nand the costs of the United Nations Compensation\r\nCommission. The total value of the supplies that have\r\narrived in Iraq from the beginning of 1997 to the present is\r\n$4,948,300,000, while the funds deducted for the Special\r\nCommission, the United Nations services and the\r\nCompensation Commission are $4,041,185,000.\r\nA cursory look at these two figures clearly shows the\r\nfailure of the Memorandum of Understanding to meet the\r\nessential humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq. The\r\nmethods the United States and Britain use in dealing with\r\nthe contracts that are related to humanitarian needs, and the\r\ndeliberate delay in processing these contracts, make the\r\nmain goal of the Memorandum of Understanding the\r\nfinancing of the expenses of the United Nations instead of\r\nsecuring the essential humanitarian needs of the Iraqi\r\npeople and stopping the deterioration of their humanitarian\r\nand health situation.\r\nThis also exposes the intentions of the American and\r\nBritish Governments to strip the Memorandum of its\r\nhumanitarian substance by putting on hold the contracts\r\ndirectly related to the health situation of the people of\r\nIraq. For example, while the value of the contracts signed\r\nfor water, sanitation and electricity has amounted to $352\r\nmillion, the value of the supplies that have arrived in Iraq\r\nso far is only $64 million — that is, only 18 per cent of\r\nthe total value of those contracts. The rest has been put\r\non hold by the British and the Americans.\r\nThe most striking evidence of the suffering of the\r\nchildren of Iraq as a result of this unjust, comprehensive\r\nembargo is the 12 August 1999 report of the United\r\nNations Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF), which contains\r\nstatistics on child mortality resulting from malnutrition,\r\nshortages of medicines and the deteriorating economic\r\nand nutritional situation of Iraqi mothers. The report has\r\nproved decisively that the embargo imposed on Iraq is the\r\nmain reason for the huge increase in the child mortality\r\nrate.\r\nThe United States Administration has spared no\r\ncosts to distort the facts about the Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding, or spared any tendentious lies and\r\nallegations about the distribution of food and medical\r\nsupplies. The Secretary-General\u0027s reports on the Iraq\r\nprogramme, which are based on the reports of United\r\nNations observers deployed throughout Iraq, have proved\r\nthe accuracy, regularity and equity of the distribution\r\nprocess of all humanitarian supplies received under the\r\nMemorandum of Understanding.\r\nThe United States of America deliberately works to\r\nmaintain the embargo and to double the suffering of the\r\npeople of Iraq, despite the disappearance of all the\r\nreasons linked to the imposition of the embargo. This\r\nAmerican objective has become quite clear through the\r\nmany statements made by American officials that make\r\nthe embargo a tool to achieve the hostile American\r\npolitical policy against Iraq.\r\nOne of the basic pillars of the hostile\r\nAmerican/British policy against Iraq is the imposition of\r\nthe two no-fly zones on Iraq. This constitutes a violation\r\nof the United Nations Charter and international law. We\r\nhave already mentioned the evidence about this in a letter\r\nto the President of the Security Council dated 15 January\r\n1999. This has also been confirmed by the views\r\nexpressed by some permanent members and by others\r\ninside and outside the deliberations of the Council.\r\nIt is well-known that the continuation of these no-fly\r\nzones is a means to perpetuate the aggression with a view\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nto achieving the purposes of the Anglo-American political\r\nscheme against Iraq. American officials do not hesitate to\r\nindicate their real intentions of using these daily\r\nbombardment operations to achieve the United States\r\nAdministration\u0027s goals against Iraq\u0027s independence and\r\nsovereignty and to destabilize its patriotic Government.\r\nThe Washington Post published on 31 January 1999 an\r\narticle quoting a senior official of the United States\r\nAdministration describing a certain attack as a means of\r\nreaching the goal in a way that satisfied all objectives\r\nwithout any loss, and saying that if the United States were\r\nto carry out a massive campaign, people would inquire\r\nabout what had provoked such attacks.\r\nProceeding from this policy of partitioning the\r\naggression, the American and British warplanes have been\r\ncarrying out daily exercises in a show of power that\r\nviolates Iraq\u0027s airspace. In this way they launch savage\r\nbombardment operations against civil and economic sites in\r\nIraq, including communication stations, oil pumping stations\r\nand private houses. Even mosques and churches have not\r\nbeen spared these continued savage attacks; the churches\r\ninclude the Church of Mar Matti, which goes back to the\r\nfourth century AD and which the American and British\r\naircraft bombed on 11 August 1999.\r\nFrom the aggression of December 1998 to the present,\r\nthe total number of sorties carried out by American and\r\nBritish aircraft amounted to 12,143, of which 9,830,\r\nlaunched from Saudi and Kuwaiti territory, were carried out\r\nin southern Iraq. Two thousand three hundred and thirteen\r\n(2,313) sorties were carried out in northern Iraq from\r\nTurkish territory.\r\nThe United States Administration is seeking to find\r\ninconsistent pretexts for these daily acts of aggression, to\r\nwhich hundreds of innocent civilians fall victim. It claims\r\nthat the bombing of civilians is in legitimate self-defence\r\nagainst Iraqi air force attacks.\r\nLet us ask this: where does the United States derive\r\nthe right to defend an act that lacks any kind of basic legal\r\nlegitimacy? Who gives the American aggressors the right to\r\nact in self-defence, as they claim, in Iraqi airspace? The\r\nacts carried out by the United States Administration\r\nrepresent a declared war waged against the people of Iraq.\r\nThis is a charade — no more, no less. A senior Pentagon\r\nofficial, in describing these operations in the The\r\nWashington Post on 2 September 1999, admitted that this\r\nwas a low-level war.\r\nProceeding from its legitimate right to self-defence,\r\nwhich is guaranteed in all international instruments and\r\ncovenants, Iraq will not hesitate to counter all American\r\nand British acts of aggression that aim at violating the\r\nintegrity of its airspace and territory and threaten its\r\nsecurity as well as that of its people.\r\nIraq will continue to confront American and British\r\naggression by all available means and potential. It will not\r\nyield to American blackmail. The hostile policy of the\r\nUnited States towards Iraq, which runs counter to the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law, has\r\nbeen made clear in official statements by senior officials\r\nin the United States Administration that stress that the\r\nUnited States is determined to unseat the patriotic\r\nGovernment of Iraq and dismember its national unity.\r\nIn addition, the highest American legislative body\r\nhas enacted laws that allow the Administration to interfere\r\nin Iraq\u0027s internal affairs, to allocate huge sums of money\r\nto carry out acts of terrorism, sabotage and assassination\r\ninside Iraq and to appoint high-ranking officials in the\r\nAdministration to oversee these immoral and illegitimate\r\ntasks.\r\nThis American policy has contributed to encouraging\r\nTurkish forces to carry out large-scale military operations\r\ninside Iraqi territory on the pretext of chasing elements of\r\nthe Kurdistan Workers\u0027 Party (PKK). These Turkish\r\nmilitary operations have caused instability and disorder in\r\nnorthern Iraq and pose a threat to Iraq\u0027s national security\r\nand territorial integrity. Iraq has regularly reported these\r\nrepeated Turkish acts of aggression to the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General and to the President of the Security\r\nCouncil. These acts constitute a violation of the principles\r\nof good-neighbourliness and a threat to international\r\npeace and security in the region. But the United Nations\r\nhas taken no action to curb these operations, and the\r\nreason is very clear: it is a reflection of the United States\r\npolicy aimed at maintaining the abnormal situation in\r\nIraq.\r\nThe continued United States hegemony and\r\ngovernance of the destinies of the peoples of the world,\r\nas well as of international economic and political\r\norganizations, confront the United Nations with its most\r\nserious challenge ever. The United Nations should stand\r\nup to this domination and prove its ability to restore\r\nequilibrium so as to realize the purposes set out in the\r\nCharter, primarily the achievement of peace, security and\r\nstability, the promotion of friendly relations and the\r\nencouragement of economic cooperation between States.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 12th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nIn a speech delivered by President Saddam Hussein on\r\n17 January 1999, Iraq called for an assembly of various\r\ninstitutions to be established by interested States to agree\r\nupon statutes and charters with a view to achieving serious\r\ncooperation in the economic, political and military fields in\r\norder to preserve balance and bring about peace, starting\r\nwith Asia and questions related to it. That assembly would\r\nnot be directed against anyone, but would be aimed at\r\nprotecting its members and at legitimately defending their\r\nsecurity and interests as well as international security, in\r\naccordance with established humanitarian norms. From this\r\nrostrum we call upon the peoples and States of the world\r\nthat have faith in the values, culture, freedom,\r\nindependence, justice and equity of the nations and peoples\r\nof the world, to consider President Saddam Hussein\u0027s\r\nproposal with a view to initiating a dialogue aimed at\r\nturning the proposal into a reality that would help achieve\r\nbalance, peace and security throughout the world.\r\nMoreover, many States, including permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council, have explicitly called for a multipolar\r\nworld in which political, economic and military balance\r\nprevails, in the interest of maintaining international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe United Nations adherence to the principles set out\r\nin its Charter and the full and fair implementation of its\r\nresolutions, without selectivity and discrimination, is the\r\nbenchmark of its credibility in restoring the trust of States\r\nin its ability to achieve justice and peace and to\r\nencourage States to comply with and implement the\r\nprovisions of its resolutions.\r\nThe United Nations, in particular the Security\r\nCouncil, should implement its resolutions on the Middle\r\nEast, primarily those relating to the question of Palestine,\r\nand should support the legitimate struggle of the\r\nPalestinian people to regain their legitimate and\r\ninalienable rights to live on their national soil in Palestine.\r\nIt should also support their struggle against the Zionist\r\ncolonization of their territory and their fight to establish\r\na sovereign independent State on their national territory,\r\nwith Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nThe United Nations must implement its resolutions\r\non making the Middle East a zone free from weapons of\r\nmass destruction. In particular, it should implement\r\nparagraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991),\r\nwhich considers Iraq\u0027s disarmament a step towards\r\nestablishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons\r\nof mass destruction. So far the United Nations has taken\r\nno steps in that direction.\r\nIn conclusion, the realization of the concepts of\r\njustice, democracy and development throughout the world\r\nis subject to the fair democratization of international\r\norganizations, in particular the United Nations. These\r\nconcepts can be achieved only through carrying out an\r\ninterrelated series of administrative, structural and\r\npolitical reforms of the United Nations, its agencies and\r\norgans so that it can shoulder its responsibilities under the\r\nCharter, primarily its responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.50 p.m.\r\n32\r\n"
