(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Lansana Conté, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guinea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guinea.\r\nMr. Lansana Conté, President of the Republic of\r\nGuinea, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea, His Excellency Mr.\r\nLansana Conté, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Conté (spoke in French): I should like to\r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your well-\r\ndeserved election to the presidency of the fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the General Assembly and to convey to you, on\r\nbehalf of the people and Government of Guinea, my\r\nwarmest congratulations. I am convinced that our Assembly\r\nstands to gain a great deal from your leadership and from\r\nyour wealth of experience.\r\nI would like also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for his commendable efforts\r\nto advance the process of the reform of our Organization.\r\nFinally, allow me to convey my sincere\r\ncongratulations and words of encouragement to Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, who, since taking the helm of our Organization, has\r\nworked tirelessly to make of it a catalyst and a unique\r\nframework for nations to work together. We share that\r\nconviction and would like to assure him of our unflagging\r\nsupport in that respect.\r\nThe present-day world is characterized by a rapid\r\nevolution that has taken the form of profound political,\r\neconomic and social changes. Those changes have had an\r\nimpact on peace, international security and development.\r\nThe quest for peace and for a new and more\r\nequitable international order has become the major\r\nconcern of our age. The United Nations cannot insulate\r\nitself from these changes. Its effectiveness will depend on\r\nits ability to re-adapt itself to today\u0027s realities.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations, the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, disarmament, the fight\r\nagainst poverty and the strengthening of international\r\ncooperation — all of these matters will require our\r\nattention and energy in the third millennium.\r\nI am certain, therefore, that the Assembly will agree\r\nthat the events taking place today clearly show the need\r\nto reform the United Nations.\r\nAll the arguments favour such a change as a means\r\nof strengthening the United Nations system and\r\ndemocratizing its main bodies, particular the Security\r\nCouncil, to make it into an authentic tool in the service\r\npeace and development for all. Our position on these\r\nissues is in accordance with that of the African Group as\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nset forth at the thirty-fifth summit of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in Algiers. The new make-up of the\r\nSecurity Council must fully reflect present-day realities\r\nthrough the equitable geographic representation of every\r\nregion of the world.\r\nThe increasing number of conflicts is undermining the\r\nfoundations of international peace and security and\r\ndangerously compromising the development efforts of our\r\nStates. In this respect, I am sure the Assembly agrees that\r\nthere can be no development without a consistent political\r\ncommitment on the part of our States to peace and\r\ndisarmament. That is why my delegation believes that any\r\nsign of indifference or silence on the part of the\r\ninternational community when confronted with the spectre\r\nof violence and the use of weapons of mass destruction can\r\nprove fatal for international peace and security.\r\nAs in the past, the Republic of Guinea can neither\r\nremain silent nor conceal its concern with regard to the\r\nincreasing number of areas of tension and conflict\r\nthroughout the world, particularly in Africa. Indeed, more\r\nthan two thirds of the items currently on the agenda of the\r\nSecurity Council relate to critical situations in Africa.\r\nHowever, despite these difficult circumstances, our\r\ncontinent has courageously taken its destiny into its own\r\nhands by creating, under the auspices of the OAU, a\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\r\nResolution. With the assistance of the United Nations, this\r\nmechanism should be able to play a major role in\r\nmaintaining peace on the continent.\r\nAfrica needs international cooperation if it is to make\r\nthis instrument fully effective, given the breadth and\r\ncomplexity of the task that it must undertake. For some 10\r\nyears, West Africa has been particularly tested by the\r\nfratricidal wars in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.\r\nThey have had very serious consequences for those\r\ncountries, which have become fields of desolation and\r\nwhose reconstruction will require the assistance of the\r\ninternational community for a long time to come.\r\nIn this context, particular attention should be paid to\r\nthe unfortunate young people in those countries. Tens of\r\nthousands of adolescents have been dragged into those\r\nwars, and now they are skilled only at fighting. It is\r\nessential to provide for and ensure their economic and\r\nsocial integration so as to prevent them from becoming\r\neasy prey to the warlords who are laying waste to the\r\nregion.\r\nThe consequences of the conflicts and tensions in the\r\nneighbouring countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and\r\nGuinea-Bissau have affected Guinea in many ways and\r\nsignificantly impeded the achievement of its development\r\ntargets. My country has provided asylum to several\r\nhundred thousands of refugees, whose presence in our\r\nland has had a very serious impact on its economy,\r\nenvironment and security. The impact of the refugees and\r\nthe burden they represent for the country in general, and\r\nfor the host populations in particular, have been\r\nenormous, making Guinea one of the leading countries of\r\nasylum in the world, since the high proportion of refugees\r\nmakes up more than one tenth of its population.\r\nThis situation has affected the ability of the\r\nGovernment to achieve its priority development objectives\r\nbecause of the tremendous unforeseen expenses that\r\nGuinea has had to bear and will continue to have to bear\r\nin order to restore peace, security and stability in the\r\nsubregion, together with the other States members of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS).\r\nDespite the support of the international community\r\nin the face of these crises and conflicts that are\r\nconvulsing our continent, it is regrettable to note the\r\ndiscriminatory way in which Africa is treated in dealing\r\nwith the refugee problem. We should like here to\r\nwelcome the gratifying initiative of the United Nations to\r\nmake the Republic of Guinea the focal point of stability\r\nin the subregion.\r\nIn this connection, a solidarity conference to\r\nstrengthen Guinea\u0027s stability and efforts for sustainable\r\ndevelopment will soon be held in Brussels. My country,\r\nwhich has high expectations of that meeting, would like\r\nto appeal to all donors to increase their support for the\r\nefforts of the Government of Guinea to deal with the\r\nsocio-economic consequences of the massive presence of\r\nrefugees in our territory.\r\nI should like to reiterate to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the sincere gratitude of the people of\r\nGuinea for his recent visit to our country, and I am\r\npleased to be able solemnly to pay tribute to his personal\r\naction to mobilize the international community for the\r\nbenefit of Guinea.\r\nThe subregion of West Africa is not the only one\r\nthat has suffered from war. We remain deeply concerned\r\nby the fratricidal struggles that are convulsing Central\r\nAfrica, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nCongo and Angola; those conflicts continue to be at the\r\nforefront of the international political scene. While\r\ndeploring the situation, which is a threat to the stability of\r\nour continent, I should like here to call on all the parties\r\nconcerned to give a chance to the negotiation and mediation\r\nefforts under way in various places so that those crises can\r\nbe overcome. I congratulate the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and encourage them to\r\npursue their initiatives and concrete actions aimed at\r\nrestoring peace in those countries.\r\nToday more than ever, the Middle East needs peace\r\nand security. Such a peace can be built only with mutual\r\nconfidence and the desire to live together, with respect for\r\nthe rights and the dignity of all the peoples of the region.\r\nThat is why we welcome the recent developments in the\r\nMiddle East, particularly in Israel. The hopes that have\r\nbeen raised should not be dashed.\r\nIn Yugoslavia, the advent of peace requires tolerance\r\nand respect for the territorial integrity and the right to\r\ncoexistence of all the various parts of that nation. The\r\nestablishment of a true State based on the rule of law is the\r\nonly way of guaranteeing the reconstruction of the country,\r\nwith the assistance of the international community.\r\nAnother subject of major concern to Africa is that of\r\neconomic matters and international cooperation. Here we\r\nmust acknowledge that efforts to date have not yielded the\r\nresults we had hoped for in meeting the needs and\r\naspirations of our peoples. An in-depth, comprehensive,\r\nproactive approach to development problems, as defined at\r\nthe Second Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment, deserves the support and assistance of the\r\ninternational community. Unfortunately, one of the essential\r\nelements of such cooperation — the North-South dialogue\r\nso eagerly sought by our countries — remains at an\r\nimpasse. All the while, disparities between the rich\r\ncountries of the North and the underdeveloped countries of\r\nthe South have grown. The arbitrary fixing of prices for\r\ncommodities and manufactured goods by the North reduces\r\nto the point of futility the measures that have been proposed\r\nto alleviate the burden of external-debt servicing.\r\nThe system of trade too is based on discrimination.\r\nUnder the banner of liberalization and free competition,\r\nglobalization has had the effect of eroding or even\r\neliminating preferences providing our commodities with\r\naccess to the markets of the North. It is vital to establish\r\ntimetables for adaptation and for the provision of alternative\r\ncompensation so that our countries can maximize their\r\npotential as participants in world trade. Further, because of\r\nthe importance of the fight against poverty in developing\r\ncountries, we call upon donor countries to redouble their\r\nefforts to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct for official development assistance.\r\nTurning to the crucial question of debt, it is now our\r\nfirm conviction that no economic-recovery programme\r\ncan have the hoped-for results without a favourable\r\napproach to the backlog of debt burdening African\r\ncountries, particularly the most heavily indebted among\r\nthem. While my delegation welcomes the recent decisions\r\ntaken by the Group of Eight at Cologne, we are\r\nnonetheless concerned that efforts need to be made to\r\nproduce a lasting resolution of the debt question. Debt\r\ncontinues to swallow up the bulk of the resources of poor\r\ncountries, particularly those in Africa, whose earnings are\r\ndiminishing daily in spite of the great sacrifices made by\r\nour peoples with the adoption of structural adjustment\r\nmeasures.\r\nWe therefore call for the convening of an\r\ninternational conference on the external debt of Africa\r\nwith a view to finding a final solution to this problem;\r\nthis would revitalize our ever more fragile economies. I\r\nwish in that connection to say that my country is now\r\nengaged in ongoing dialogue with the Paris Club of\r\nIndustrial Country Creditors, the relevant Consultative\r\nGroup, and the donor community with a view to\r\nsignificant rescheduling of our external debt.\r\nTurning to the question of human rights and\r\ndemocracy, my Government believes that the eradication\r\nof poverty, social inequality and ignorance is a\r\nprerequisite for the promotion of human rights. Even\r\nthough we are living through a difficult situation, my\r\ncountry remains deeply committed to democratic values\r\nand fundamental freedoms and has created all the\r\nnecessary institutions for a State based on law; the proper\r\nfunctioning of these will contribute to our political\r\nstability.\r\nWe have been witness to the gradual emergence of\r\na sense of hope, common destiny and a new partnership\r\namong nations. Such a world vision, however, should not\r\nto cloak our profound concern at a time when humanity\r\nis preparing to cross the threshold of the third\r\nmillennium. The international community must do\r\neverything in its power to bring about the triumph of\r\nhope, even if threats to the very existence of the world\r\npersist. If it is to shoulder these responsibilities to the full,\r\nthe international community has no choice but to help the\r\nUnited Nations adapt to the major changes under way in\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nthe world and must play its proper role in that world. More\r\nthan ever before, mankind must understand that it bears\r\nresponsibility for its own future.\r\nIn the name of human solidarity, the very fabric of\r\ninternational cooperation, I call upon all members of this\r\ngreat world family to make the United Nations a centre for\r\nharmonizing the efforts of the nations of the world, united\r\nin defence of our common destiny: a house in which all our\r\nwills converge resolutely, looking towards the future, and\r\nin which humanity can flourish and be united on the basis\r\nof freedom, justice, peace and prosperity. Long live the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Guinea for\r\nhis statement.\r\nMr. Lansana Conté, President of the Republic of\r\nGuinea, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Colonel (Retired) Yahya Jammeh, President\r\nof the Republic of the Gambia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of the Gambia.\r\nColonel (Retired) Yahya Jammeh, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Gambia, His Excellency\r\nColonel (Retired) Yahya Jammeh, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Jammeh: Let me first of all congratulate\r\nyou, Mr. President, on your unanimous election to preside\r\nover the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Only\r\na few years ago, the United Nations was actively involved\r\nin the decolonization of then South West Africa, now\r\nNamibia. Today, it is with a great sense of pride, therefore,\r\nthat we see not only an old freedom fighter but also a\r\nconsummate diplomat from Namibia presiding over the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly of the second millennium\r\nand ushering in the beginning of the third. I have no doubt\r\nwhatsoever that with your vast experience you will steer\r\nthis historic session to a successful conclusion. You can rest\r\nassured of the full support and cooperation of the Gambian\r\ndelegation in carrying out your important assignments.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for the\r\nbusiness like manner in which he conducted the fifty-third\r\nsession, an eventful period indeed, characterized by far-\r\nreaching decisions in areas of common concern to the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn the same vein, I would like to commend our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the exemplary\r\nway in which he has been handling the affairs of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nToday, the membership of our Organization stands\r\nat the impressive figure of 188. In this connection, I\r\nwould like, on behalf of the Government and the people\r\nof the Gambia, and indeed on my own behalf, to\r\ncongratulate the Republic of Nauru, the Republic of\r\nKiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga on their admission to\r\nmembership in the United Nations. We are confident that\r\nthese new Member States will bring with them all the\r\ncharm and wisdom of island nations to enrich the work of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nAll nations, big or small, have something to offer.\r\nThis is particularly true of small States that have no\r\nspheres of influence to preserve, but the honest desire to\r\nparticipate in and contribute to the betterment of our\r\nworld. Small States have the advantage of coming up\r\nwith refreshing ideas and offering new perspectives in the\r\nsearch for solutions to problems of common concern.\r\nMaking this world a better place for the human race\r\nto live in is the collective responsibility of all of us. All\r\nStates, big or small, should contribute to the collective\r\nendeavour to rid this world of wars, hunger, destitution,\r\ndisease, suffering, homelessness, despair, terror, tyranny\r\nand economic backwardness.\r\nMaking this world a better place to live is not a far-\r\nfetched dream. It is a goal we can achieve if all nations,\r\ncollectively as well as individually, sincerely commit\r\nthemselves to working towards achieving this goal. Our\r\nvery survival as the human race in the new millennium\r\ndepends on the achievement of this noble objective.\r\nHow do we achieve this noble objective? First of all,\r\nwe must commit ourselves to living and working for\r\npeace on earth. We must respect the sovereign rights of\r\nnations, big or small, rich or poor, to exist without fear of\r\nbeing marginalized, suppressed or intimidated by larger,\r\nricher or more populous nations. This is why, quite apart\r\nfrom the principle of universality, my Government\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nsincerely believes that this body should seriously reconsider\r\nits position on the readmission of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan to the United Nations. With a population of almost\r\n22 million and the nineteenth-largest economy in the world,\r\nand being the fifteenth-largest trading nation, the Republic\r\nof China — a highly responsible member of the\r\ninternational community, a free and democratic country that\r\nhas always promoted world trade and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment around the world and at the same time has\r\ncontributed to the eradication of poverty — has a lot to\r\noffer if readmitted to the United Nations. By allowing the\r\n22 million people in Taiwan to be represented in the United\r\nNations, we would be enforcing the principles enshrined in\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as\r\ncontributing to the promotion of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWhere this Assembly has recognized the then\r\nexistence of two Germanies and the present existence of the\r\ntwo Koreas, the logic of the readmission of the Republic of\r\nChina into this Assembly of nations is a matter of justice\r\nand equity. How can the United Nations sideline such an\r\nimportant country as if we were still living in the past?\r\nFor reasons that we all know too well, in 1971, the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI), by\r\nwhich it conferred membership upon the People\u0027s Republic\r\nof China. But the same resolution failed miserably to\r\naddress the issue of representation in the United Nations for\r\nthe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The cold\r\nwar is over. The time has now come to correct this sad\r\nmistake, and there could not be a better time than now,\r\nwhen we are at the threshold of the twenty-first century, to\r\nrecognize the Republic of China and, by extension, the\r\nvoice of its 22 million people.\r\nHaving said that, I would now like to focus attention\r\ncloser to home for a few minutes. Five years ago, when I\r\nled the Gambia National Army to take over the reigns of\r\npower in the Gambia, I was motivated by the sole desire to\r\nrescue my people from the abyss of despair and destruction\r\nafter 30 years of rampant corruption and nepotism, to say\r\nthe least. There was a general laissez-faire attitude that was\r\nrapidly assuming alarming proportions and that could have\r\nspelt disaster for the country had we not stepped in to put\r\nto an end the excesses of a rotten and morally bankrupt\r\nregime. It would be hard for anyone to imagine that a\r\nGovernment elected by the people would deprive its\r\ncitizens of their basic needs for 30 long years. Not a single\r\nschool, not a single hospital was built by that Government.\r\nThat was why during the two-year transition to\r\nconstitutional democratic rule, my Government immediately\r\nembarked on an intensive socio-economic development\r\nprogramme, building schools, hospitals, roads and bridges\r\nand carrying out other infrastructural development\r\nprojects, such as building a new airport terminal and the\r\nextension of the port of Banjul.\r\nIt is now a thing of the past for any child to worry\r\nabout trekking miles and miles to school. There are\r\nenough schools in all the administrative areas in the\r\ncountry, including high schools, for our children,\r\nespecially the girls, to stay close to their homes and\r\nfamilies. In this way we encourage parents to send their\r\ngirls to school.\r\nIn addition to encouraging and increasing access to\r\nbasic education for all Gambian children, my Government\r\nhas identified a need to provide tertiary education and has\r\nestablished a university. The first batch of students will\r\nenrol in the University of The Gambia in October 1999.\r\nSimilarly, in the area of health, we have so far built\r\ntwo major hospitals, and a number of health centres\r\naround the country. Obviously we could not put right all\r\nthe neglect of 30 years in just two years, but the\r\ndifference is clear. Naturally the people of the Gambia\r\nwanted more progress. I was therefore persuaded by\r\npeople across the country to resign from the army and run\r\nfor office in a free and fair election under international\r\nsupervision. I accepted the challenge, strengthened in my\r\nconviction that a direct mandate from the people would\r\nenable me to work harder for them. We have since been\r\nmaking greater strides in the uphill task of nation-\r\nbuilding.\r\nThe very survival of the Gambia in this ever-\r\nchanging world is an issue of major concern as we step\r\ninto the next century, which will be fraught with many\r\ndaunting challenges. The Gambia, like many other\r\ndeveloping countries, has been forced to rethink its\r\ndevelopment agenda while looking for a more meaningful\r\nliving environment for its people.\r\nThe desire of both Government and people for a\r\ndeveloped nation is clearly expressed in the country\u0027s\r\ndevelopment blueprint, “Vision 2020, The Gambia\r\nIncorporated”. Our macroeconomic policies and strategies\r\ncontinue to be spearheaded by Vision 2020, with an\r\noverall goal of achieving sustainable growth and\r\neradicating poverty.\r\nMy Government is working very closely with the\r\nWorld Bank, the European Union, the United Nations\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nDevelopment Programme and all the specialized agencies\r\nof the United Nations system in their fields of competence\r\nin order to eradicate poverty, illiteracy and disease so that\r\nas a healthy nation founded on solid, democratic principles\r\nof good governance, we can stride ahead to build a nation\r\nwith a strong economy in an atmosphere of social justice\r\nand political stability.\r\nRecognizing that improving the governance\r\nenvironment is a sine qua non for sustainable development,\r\nthe Government of the Gambia has incorporated good-\r\ngovernance strategies in all national development initiatives\r\nand plans. The Gambia National Governance Programme,\r\nwhich was recently launched, was developed through an\r\nextensive process of consultation and consensus-building.\r\nIn our bid to create an atmosphere of dignity and\r\nrespect for our citizenry we are fully committed to\r\ndemocratic constitutionality. We consider this the only\r\nfeasible political framework for good governance, which is\r\nan essential prerequisite for sustainable development. We\r\nalso believe that democracy cannot exist in a situation of\r\nabject poverty. Our national governance programme\r\nincludes provisions for constitutional review and reform of\r\nthe electoral system and process; reform of parliamentary\r\nstructures and processes; civic education; reform of the\r\nlegal and judicial process; public-sector management and\r\nadministrative reform; and decentralization and local\r\ngovernment reform.\r\nGiven the complexity and scope of the governance\r\npolicy framework, its effective implementation will require\r\ncareful planning and mobilization of resources. A round-\r\ntable conference, to be organized very soon, will seek to\r\nmobilize further support to cover part of the funding gap.\r\nIt is our hope that our partners in development will\r\ncontinue to support us in this endeavour.\r\nWe are mindful that meaningful socio-economic\r\ndevelopment can be brought about and be sustained only in\r\nan atmosphere of stability and security — not only in our\r\nown country, but also in its neighbouring countries. With\r\nthe world becoming more globalized, lack of security and\r\npeace in any one part of the world affects the rest of\r\nmankind, especially those of us in the developing countries.\r\nWe place a high premium on the maintenance of peace and\r\nstability both at home and abroad.\r\nThis is why, in our sister republic of Guinea-Bissau,\r\nwe all worked hard, encouraged by the rest of the\r\ninternational community, to put a definitive end to the\r\nconflict there. In our efforts to achieve this objective, we,\r\ntogether with other West African countries, participated\r\nin the Economic Community of West African States\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) peacekeeping operations\r\nin Guinea-Bissau, even though the whole mission itself\r\nwas short-lived. Now that peace and stability have been\r\nreturned to that country, we encourage the international\r\ncommunity to contribute to the country\u0027s reconciliation\r\nand reconstruction effort.\r\nThe Gambia, as coordinator of the work of the group\r\nof friends of Guinea-Bissau at the United Nations, will\r\ncontinue to play a leading role in this endeavour. In the\r\nsame vein, in our continuing search for peace and\r\nstability in our subregion we in the Gambia have\r\nspearheaded efforts to mediate in the Casamance question\r\nthrough dialogue. As a result, in June of this year we\r\ngathered together in Banjul all the stakeholders in the\r\nCasamance issue with a view to providing a forum for the\r\nMovement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC)\r\nfactions to articulate a common position for their\r\nimpending dialogue with the Government of Senegal. This\r\nhas been yielding positive results as it has already led to\r\na cessation of hostilities in the Casamance region of\r\nSenegal. The cessation of hostilities, which is a\r\nconsequence of the Banjul encounters, has been so\r\nencouraging that refugees have started to return home\r\neven before a final settlement is reached. At last we can\r\nsee light at the end of the tunnel.\r\nThe momentum created by the Banjul meetings\r\namong the MFDC factions should be maintained. A final\r\nMFDC meeting will soon be convened and is expected to\r\nherald formal consultations between the Government of\r\nSenegal and the MFDC. These, we hope, will lead to a\r\nlasting settlement that will put an end to the devastation\r\nand its attendant human suffering.\r\nMeanwhile, in our sister Republic of Sierra Leone,\r\nit is gratifying to note that a peace agreement has now\r\nbeen signed between the Government and the\r\nRevolutionary United Front after almost nine years of one\r\nof the most devastating, fratricidal and brutal wars of our\r\ntime, a war characterized by outrageous atrocities\r\ncommitted by the rebels. We commend the efforts of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nleaders, ECOMOG, the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Sierra Leone and all those who\r\ncontributed in one way or another to bringing about this\r\npeaceful resolution of the conflict.\r\nThe Lomé Peace Agreement is not the ideal peace\r\nagreement, but most peace agreements come with a price.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nThe Sierra Leonean people paid dearly. We hope that,\r\ndespite all the shortcomings of the Agreement, it will create\r\nhope and opportunity for the people of Sierra Leone and\r\nfree them from terror, violence, killings, amputations and\r\nthe many other atrocities that characterized this war.\r\nThe people of Sierra Leone have also welcomed this\r\nchance to make a fresh start. They should not be abandoned\r\nto fate. The international community has an obligation to\r\ncome in rapidly, and in a big way, to help in the\r\nimplementation of the Agreement.\r\nIt would be an understatement to say that Africa is\r\nmaking great strides in the peaceful resolution of conflicts\r\nthere. A good example is the complex conflict in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo: we are encouraged by\r\nthe signing of a Ceasefire Agreement in Lusaka. On behalf\r\nof the Government and people of the Gambia, I thank\r\nPresident Chiluba of Zambia and all other leaders in Africa\r\nwho contributed to finding a political settlement to this\r\ncomplex conflict.\r\nWe note that the Security Council has deployed\r\nmilitary liaison officers to the relevant States to lay the\r\ngroundwork for the deployment of military observers. We\r\nappreciate this move by the United Nations. We must,\r\nhowever, sound a note of caution: the situation is extremely\r\nvolatile. We must therefore move swiftly, before there is a\r\nrelapse into fighting. We must not let this opportunity slip\r\naway.\r\nLikewise, in the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict, we welcome\r\nthe calm that has prevailed for a while. Most importantly,\r\nwe welcome the agreement of the parties to the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Framework\r\nAgreement. We commend the leadership role of the OAU\r\nin its efforts to resolve this fratricidal conflict. We must,\r\nhowever, say that we are yet to see a ceasefire agreement.\r\nThe parties must therefore be encouraged to translate their\r\npronouncements into action by signing a ceasefire\r\nagreement immediately. We must emphasize that the United\r\nNations should be ready to come in as soon as it is\r\npropitious to contribute to the implementation of the\r\nagreement.\r\nAfter a long and difficult period of negotiations, some\r\ngood news is coming out of Western Sahara. We note with\r\nappreciation that the identification process has progressed\r\nconsiderably. Plans for the repatriation of the refugees have\r\nalso advanced. Finally, we are coming close to the\r\nreferendum. We praise the Kingdom of Morocco for its\r\nflexibility, understanding, cooperation and courage\r\nthroughout this period.\r\nElsewhere on the continent, the political landscape\r\nis still hazy.\r\nIn Angola, the peace process has broken down\r\ncompletely due to UNITA\u0027s intransigence and flat refusal\r\nto implement in good faith the Lusaka Protocol. It is very\r\nclear to all of us that there is no military solution to that\r\nconflict. After about 30 years of war, the people of\r\nAngola have suffered enormously, especially the women\r\nand children. The future of a whole generation has been\r\ncompromised. We urge the international community to\r\ntake decisive action to ensure a peaceful and speedy\r\nresolution of that conflict. To this end, we welcome the\r\nrecent re-establishment of a United Nations presence in\r\nAngola. Such a presence is vital, but clearly it must be\r\nbuttressed by a resolute commitment of the Security\r\nCouncil to producing the much-needed peace in Angola\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nIn the case of Somalia, it is a completely different\r\nscenario. The warlords are holding the international\r\ncommunity hostage because of their own insatiable\r\nappetite to assume power at all costs. We note that the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) is\r\ndoing all it can to resolve this long and complex conflict,\r\nbut without much success. If a resolution to this conflict\r\nis to be found, we should shake off the Somalia syndrome\r\nand re-engage the issue. The international community\r\nshould recommit itself to the resolution of the Somali\r\ncrisis by developing a strategy that would send clear\r\nsignals to the warlords that their behaviour and attitude\r\ncan no longer be tolerated by civilized society.\r\nIn the case of the Sudan, my delegation welcomes\r\nwholeheartedly the peace overtures of the Government.\r\nWe believe that they are a first step in the right direction.\r\nWe encourage the other side to respond, and to respond\r\npositively. The international community should also\r\nsupport the parties in finding a lasting solution.\r\nThis brief survey of the theatres of conflict in Africa\r\nreveals once again that our continent unfortunately\r\ncontinues to claim the lion\u0027s share of trials and\r\ntribulations. This is as embarrassing as it is unacceptable\r\nand we must redouble our efforts to reverse the situation.\r\nAway from the African continent, there are other\r\nconflict situations that continue to pose serious threats to\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\ninternational peace and security and, therefore, are of\r\nserious concern to my delegation.\r\nWith regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict, my\r\nGovernment, whilst reiterating its full support for the\r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the principle\r\nof land for peace, leading to an independent Palestinian\r\nhomeland, also supports fully the Middle East peace\r\nprocess and the remarkable leadership role that the United\r\nStates is playing to move the process forward. The solution\r\nto the problem lies both with Israel and in Palestine, as well\r\nas with the international community. This is why we\r\nbelieve that the implementation of the Wye River\r\nagreement, in letter and spirit, would usher in a new era of\r\nhope for the entire Middle East region.\r\nElsewhere in the Middle East, my delegation continues\r\nto follow very closely the consequences of the Iraqi\r\ninvasion of Kuwait — in particular, the unresolved\r\nproblems of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war, missing persons,\r\nthe Kuwaiti archives and stolen property. There is nothing\r\nmore painful than the mental torture that the families of the\r\nprisoners of war and missing persons have been going\r\nthrough all these years. To treat this matter lightly would be\r\ntantamount to adding insult to injury. We can imagine the\r\npain, the anguish, the uncertainty and the endless\r\nnightmares of over 600 Kuwaiti families still hoping to hear\r\nfrom their loved ones. This is why my Government will\r\nnever allow this aspect of the problem between Iraq and\r\nKuwait to be swept under the carpet. It is a humanitarian\r\nproblem that must not be politicized and must be given all\r\nthe attention that it deserves.\r\nIn the same vein, the restitution of the Kuwaiti\r\narchives and other property is something that cannot be\r\nrelegated to the category of secondary issues. Depriving a\r\nnation of its archives is like robbing it of its national\r\nidentity.\r\nAs for the question of the disarmament of Iraq, we\r\ndeplore the current stalemate. The status quo is\r\nunacceptable, yet the Security Council appears to be\r\ndivided on how to move forward. The Council should show\r\nunity and remain steadfast; otherwise it would be sending\r\nthe wrong signal: that any country can dictate the terms of\r\nits compliance with the wishes of the international\r\ncommunity and get away with it. If that is allowed to\r\nhappen, we would be setting a very dangerous precedent.\r\nCouncil members must make an effort to draw a line\r\nbetween their narrow national interests and the collective\r\ninterests of humankind.\r\nJust as we are unequivocal with regard to the\r\ndisarmament of Iraq, we are equally uncompromising\r\nwhen it comes to the alleviation of the unwarranted\r\nsuffering of the ordinary Iraqi people who, unfortunately,\r\nhave to bear the brunt of any sanctions. The oil-for-food\r\nprogramme is a laudable effort to mitigate the impact of\r\nsanctions, but that is just about it. We want to see the\r\nremoval, destruction or rendering harmless of all Iraqi\r\nweapons of mass destruction, but we do not subscribe to\r\nthe destruction of Iraq under any pretext whatsoever. It is\r\ndisheartening to see what sanctions have done to the\r\ninnocent women, children and elderly people of Iraq.\r\nThis, too, is unacceptable and was not the objective of the\r\nsanctions. A net distinction must henceforth be made\r\nbetween the regime and the people. As with all other\r\nexisting and future sanctions, they must be clearly\r\ntargeted at those responsible in order to avoid inflicting\r\nundue pain and suffering on innocent people.\r\nStill on the thorny issue of sanctions, my\r\nGovernment is pleased that sanctions imposed on the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya have been suspended, but we\r\ncannot wait to see them lifted completely because Libya\r\nhas fulfilled all its international obligations under the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We call for the\r\nimmediate and complete lifting of all the sanctions\r\nimposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nCuba, too, has been reeling under unjust sanctions\r\nfor 38 years now. These sanctions should be scrapped\r\nbecause they are counterproductive and inhumane. We are\r\nof the opinion that the new millennium should usher in an\r\nera devoid of avoidable and man-made disasters and\r\nconflicts that wreak untold suffering on the innocent.\r\nToday, at the threshold of the new millennium, we should\r\nforgive and forget the past and reconcile in order to make\r\nthis world a better place for mankind. We therefore\r\nreiterate our call for the immediate lifting of the economic\r\nand financial blockade imposed on Cuba.\r\nWhilst it is important to uphold the principle of non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States, when a State\r\nexceeds all bounds and engages in the heinous policy of\r\nethnic cleansing, as in Kosovo, the rest of the\r\ninternational community cannot remain silent. The timely\r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)\r\nmarked a watershed in the history of the conflict, the full\r\nimplementation of which, we hope, will bring lasting\r\npeace to Kosovo.\r\nOn the issue of East Timor, I would like to\r\ncongratulate the East Timorese on the successful conduct\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nof the historic ballot. Nothing would have been possible,\r\nthough, without the courageous first step that was taken by\r\nthe Indonesian Government leading to the 5 May\r\nAgreement, which in turn set the whole process in motion.\r\nHowever, we are greatly appalled at and shocked by the\r\nlevel of violence that ensued immediately after the verdict\r\nof the East Timorese people was made known to the\r\ninternational community. In this context, we welcome the\r\ndeployment of the multinational force.\r\nWhile we rejoice with the people of Kosovo and East\r\nTimor for the timely international efforts to restore peace,\r\nwe cannot but express despair at the slow or sometimes\r\nlack of response to African conflicts. We insist that one life\r\nin Angola or elsewhere in Africa is no less important than\r\none life in Kosovo or East Timor. The Security Council\r\nmust therefore be evenhanded and establish principled\r\ncriteria for humanitarian intervention.\r\nIn the wake of the many conflicts the world over,\r\nthere should be a concerted international effort to address\r\nthe issue of impunity. We share the philosophy that there\r\ncan be no peace without justice, no justice without law and\r\nno meaningful law without a court to decide what is just\r\nand lawful under any given circumstances.\r\nBecause of this conviction, we support international\r\nefforts to establish an International Criminal Court (ICC)\r\nwhich would have jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide\r\nand crimes against humanity. We encourage all States to\r\nconsider ratifying the Statute of the ICC. The Gambia has\r\nalready signed the Statute and has since set the process in\r\nmotion for its ratification.\r\nThere is a phenomenon, though, that constitutes a\r\ncause for greater concern to my delegation, and that is the\r\nrecruitment and conscription of children as soldiers. This\r\nconstitutes a total breakdown of our fundamental value\r\nsystems. It must be stopped, as it is a blatant violation of\r\ninternational law and all norms of civilized behaviour.\r\nThe issue of the child soldier is a moral one, and it is\r\nthe collective responsibility of the international community\r\nto fight against a situation where the leaders of tomorrow\r\nare exposed to a life of violence, vengeance and hate, a\r\nsituation which breeds in their minds the dangerous notion\r\nthat he who wields the gun demands and deserves respect.\r\nThe plight of the children in the refugee camps does not\r\naugur well for a brighter future as they invariably grow up\r\nwith vengeful hearts towards those they deem to be\r\nresponsible for their plight. In a nutshell, an end to all\r\nconflicts is the only means to arrest this tragic trend.\r\nAnother social malaise of a deadlier threat to all\r\nsocieties, rich and poor alike, is the drug menace. This\r\nscourge threatens the very fabric of society and indeed the\r\nfixture of mankind, as it respects no national boundary. It\r\nis also a major cause of most crimes and violence in our\r\nurban centres, and it has grown to such proportions that\r\nit is beyond the capacity of any single State to eradicate\r\nit. Thus, we applaud the timely initiative of President\r\nErnesto Zedillo of Mexico for convening a special session\r\ndevoted to the drug problem. This special session no\r\ndoubt rekindled the interest that we all share in the fight\r\nagainst drugs. We all crave for a drug-free world. A\r\ndaunting task though it may be, we must take up the\r\nchallenge because the stakes are so high that we cannot\r\nafford to be complacent.\r\nThe issue of small arms and landmines is also a\r\nperennial problem which continues to fuel and exacerbate\r\nconflicts in Africa and elsewhere with devastating\r\nconsequences. We oppose the proliferation of small arms\r\nand the laying of landmines and call for international\r\npartnership to address this concern. In this context, we\r\nurge arms manufacturing countries to exercise restraint in\r\ntheir transfer of arms to regions of conflict. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome the entry into force of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\r\nTheir Destruction.\r\nEqually worrisome is the illicit trafficking in small\r\narms and sensitive technologies. On the wider question of\r\ndisarmament, whilst we recognize the efforts being made\r\ntowards the achievement of a fissile material cut-off treaty\r\nand the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, we\r\ncontinue to add our voice to the campaign for the total\r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, we look\r\nforward to the Preparatory Committee for the 2000\r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nBefore closing the chapter on the review of the\r\ninternational political scene, I would like to thank all the\r\npeople and organizations, as well as members of the\r\ninternational community, who have been working\r\nrelentlessly to devise peaceful and negotiated solutions to\r\nthe problems besetting mankind today. We, the younger\r\ngeneration, would want to live in a conflict-free and\r\ncrisis-free world in the third millennium. We would want\r\nto bequeath to the next generation a world devoid of\r\nwars, poverty, hunger, racism and deprivation; a world\r\nwhere the whole of humankind would live like a single\r\nfamily; a world where meaningful socio-economic\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\ndevelopment would be the collective responsibility of all\r\nthe world\u0027s citizens; a world where peace, love, mutual\r\nrespect and collective security would be the order of the\r\nday.\r\nIt has since become an established fact that poverty is\r\nthe root cause of many conflicts in the world, particularly\r\nin Africa.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that following the social summit\r\na number of poverty eradication strategies have been\r\nelaborated, and it is our fervent hope that the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly devoted to the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the World Summit for\r\nSocial Development and further initiatives will give fresh\r\nimpetus to the campaign for the eradication of poverty. One\r\neffective way of eradicating poverty in Africa would be the\r\ntotal cancellation of all of the continent\u0027s external debts.\r\nThe debt burden is the cause of untold suffering to the\r\nmasses of Africa\u0027s women, children and the elderly.\r\nRegarding the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\r\nInitiative (HIPC), much as it could be characterized as\r\nlaudable, it must be recognized that the eligibility criteria\r\nfor accessing HIPC assistance are very restrictive and\r\npenalize those countries that really need assistance. For\r\nexample, the Gambia, with a high debt service ratio of 33\r\nper cent of the gross domestic product, although meeting\r\nthe other two criteria — first, establishing a track record of\r\ngood performance and, secondly, eligibility under the\r\nEnhanced Structural Adjustment Facility and International\r\nDevelopment Association-sponsored programmes — has\r\nbeen excluded.\r\nMy delegation strongly appeals for an across-the-board\r\ncancellation of all Africa\u0027s debts so as to give us a new\r\nlease on life in the coming millennium.\r\nTalk about poverty eradication would be incomplete\r\nwithout mention of the United Nations System-wide Special\r\nInitiative on Africa. I have no doubt whatsoever that if the\r\nresources required are made available to fund all the\r\ncomponents of the Initiative within a reasonable time-frame,\r\nwe could already claim victory in the battle against poverty.\r\nIn this regard, we note with satisfaction, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council meeting held in Geneva during the month of\r\nJuly and the attention given to the segment on the\r\ndevelopment of Africa.\r\nAll said and done, in this era of globalization and\r\nliberalization, our salvation lies in regional integration and\r\ncooperation if we are to achieve economies of scale and\r\ncollective self-reliance. This is why we in the Gambia\r\nattach a lot of importance to Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS) as one of the building\r\nblocks of the African Economic Community. For us\r\nAfricans, the Lagos Plan of Action and indeed the Final\r\nAct of Lagos constitute the blue print for the economic\r\ndevelopment of Africa. It is even more relevant today\r\nthan ever before.\r\nAt the continental level, we the African leaders\r\ndecided at the recently concluded OAU extraordinary\r\nsummit in Sirte, Libya, to form a Union of African States\r\nwhich would put us in a better position to tackle the\r\ncontinent\u0027s economic and political crises that have plagued\r\nus throughout this century. However, I want to emphasize\r\nthat the objective of this African continental union is not\r\nto form a military bloc, but an economic and political one\r\ncapable of resolving Africa\u0027s numerous crises and\r\nconflicts, with the ultimate objective of eradicating\r\npoverty in Africa.\r\nToday, as we speak, the gap between rich and poor\r\nhas widened threefold. The 1999 Human Development\r\nReport has made stunning revelations, raised important\r\nissues and made a series of recommendations. The\r\nchallenges are daunting, but with the necessary political\r\nwill poverty can be eradicated, and, as stated in that\r\nreport the challenge is “to ensure that globalization works\r\nfor people — not just for profits”. In this endeavour, there\r\nshould be greater cooperation between North and South.\r\nI would like at this juncture to salute President Bill\r\nClinton\u0027s bold initiative to visit the African continent, the\r\nsecond by a sitting American President in peacetime. This\r\nvisit is very important as it gives the United States\r\nAdministration first-hand knowledge of the numerous\r\nproblems and challenges facing our continent. It also\r\nstrengthens the historic bonds linking the United States\r\nand Africa. This is a positive development that should be\r\nnurtured, as the United States will continue to play a\r\npivotal role in Africa\u0027s socio-economic development. The\r\nmassive financial and economic assistance given to some\r\nAfrican countries as a result of the visit could go a long\r\nway towards improving the living conditions of the\r\npeople in those countries, as well as ensuring a bright\r\nfuture for the African continent as a whole.\r\nThus, I cannot but express my sincere appreciation\r\nand gratitude, on behalf of the youth of Africa, for this\r\nbold and laudable initiative taken by President Clinton,\r\nand I hope that it will be emulated by future United\r\nStates Administrations.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nIt is our fervent hope, therefore, that as we approach\r\nthe threshold of the new millennium, we will draw\r\ninspiration from the Charter of the United Nations by\r\ngiving concrete expression to the pledge made therein “to\r\nemploy international machinery for the promotion of the\r\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples”.\r\nWe anxiously look forward to the Millennium\r\nAssembly, which, beyond its symbolism, could provide a\r\nunique opportunity to renew our commitment and\r\nrededicate our efforts to the attainment of this goal. It\r\nwould be inexcusable if we were not strengthened in our\r\nresolve to eradicate poverty in the next millennium. With\r\nall the global conferences since the beginning of the decade\r\non almost all issues of common concern, a solid foundation\r\nhas thus been laid. All we have to do is build upon it.\r\nIt is against this background that we are poised to\r\nembrace the third millennium and all that it has in store for\r\nus. Caught between the spectre of nuclear holocaust and the\r\noverpowering and irrepressible phenomenon of\r\nglobalization, our only hope for survival depends on how\r\nfar we are committed to putting our collective security\r\nbefore our narrow, individual national interests. This in turn\r\nis only possible through multilateralism, and the latter has\r\nproved its worth through the United Nations.\r\nHaving learned numerous bitter lessons, including the\r\nfact of two world wars in this century, the compelling need\r\nto create the United Nations to save succeeding generations\r\nfrom the scourge of war is more valid now than ever\r\nbefore, taking into account the rapid advances in military\r\ntechnology and the devastating effects of modern weaponry.\r\nOur Organization has withstood the test of time, and as\r\nlong as we continue individually and collectively to make\r\nevery effort to uphold the lofty ideals enshrined in the\r\nCharter, we can together make this world a better place for\r\nall mankind.\r\nThe United Nations is certainly not irreproachable, but\r\nit is definitely irreplaceable and indispensable. It is the\r\nembodiment of our hopes and aspirations. This is why we\r\nare emboldened in our conviction that, despite some acerbic\r\ncriticism, we envisage an even greater role for the United\r\nNations in the twenty-first century. It was therefore very\r\ntimely to adopt the Declaration and Programme of Action\r\non a Culture of Peace shortly before the beginning of this\r\nsession.\r\nIn this connection, it is important to carry out reforms\r\nwhen and where necessary to address the Organization\u0027s\r\nshortcomings. The organ that needs serious and urgent\r\nreform more than any other is the Security Council. The\r\nimportance of this body cannot be over-emphasized, but\r\nits present composition, especially at the level of\r\npermanent membership, is unacceptable, to say the least.\r\nIts composition should reflect the realities of the day and\r\nmust be democratic and transparent in its working\r\nmethods.\r\nTo begin with, it is a fact that Africa, the second\r\nlargest continent, is not represented at the permanent\r\nmember level. This anomaly should be rectified\r\nimmediately; then we can take it from there. Also not\r\nacceptable is the veto power wielded by the five\r\npermanent members, a practice that is diametrically\r\nopposed to the principles of democracy and human rights.\r\nI propose that the veto power be abolished during the\r\ncourse of the United Nations reform process.\r\nAs my country\u0027s term on the Security Council draws\r\nto an end, I would like to seize this opportunity on behalf\r\nof the Government and people of the Gambia, and indeed\r\non my own behalf, to express our sincere gratitude to the\r\nentire membership of the United Nations for the\r\nconfidence reposed in us to represent you. We also thank\r\nMembers most sincerely for the partnership and\r\ncooperation, the advice and support, without which it\r\nwould not have been possible to carry out the mandate\r\nentrusted to us. As a small country, our contribution\r\nmight have been modest, but it was sincere, in our\r\ncollective endeavour to make this world a better place for\r\nhumankind. This noble goal, in my view, is what the\r\nUnited Nations stands for.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of the\r\nGambia for the statement he has just made.\r\nColonel (Retired) Yahya Jammeh, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guyana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guyana.\r\nMr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations the President of the Republic of Guyana, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Jagdeo: I am pleased to have this\r\nopportunity, the first since my assumption of the presidency\r\nof Guyana, to share with the Assembly some issues of\r\ninterest and concern to the Group of 77, which Guyana now\r\nhas the honour to chair.\r\nA mere three months remain before mankind enters a\r\nnew millennium filled with great hopes. Whether those\r\nhopes are realized will depend largely on the decisions we\r\ntake, as an organization of united peoples, on how we\r\ncollectively face the future. This fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly therefore represents a crucial turning\r\npoint where we can follow either the high road to\r\nenlightened multilateralism or the low road leading to\r\nnarrow self-interest.\r\nI am confident that the Assembly will not fail to take\r\nthe right direction. As the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr.\r\nPresident, you have given long and distinguished service to\r\nyour country, which, after a bitter struggle against apartheid\r\nrule, stands as an independent and proud member of the\r\nfamily of nations. On behalf of the Group of 77, I salute\r\nNamibia and offer to you personally our warmest\r\ncongratulations and good wishes for a successful Assembly.\r\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay,\r\nwe offer our sincere appreciation for the guidance provided\r\nto the Assembly over the past year.\r\nA warm welcome is also extended to the three new\r\nmembers of the United Nations — the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nAnd to our Secretary-General I wish to convey our\r\ngratitude for his sustained stewardship of the Secretariat,\r\nand more particularly for his report on the Organization\u0027s\r\nwork.\r\nThe challenges we must address this year are\r\nformidable. Our world continues to be plagued by a\r\nmultiplicity of conflicts, both old and new, inter-State and\r\nintra-State, that have not only imperilled global peace and\r\nsecurity but also sap our economic and social vitality.\r\nWhether in Afghanistan, Kosovo, the Middle East or the\r\nGreat Lakes region of Africa — to name just a few conflict\r\nzones — a heavy toll is being exacted on human life and\r\ndevelopment. Equally disturbing is the apparent inability\r\nof the world community to contain this increase in\r\ntensions and conflicts.\r\nThe world Organization is continuously challenged\r\nby the outbreak of internecine strife in one country after\r\nanother. Without a clear strategy, the United Nations can\r\ndo no more than muddle through these crises in the hope\r\nthat the warring factions will eventually see the virtues of\r\npeace. In these distressing circumstances, it is not only\r\nthe parties to the conflict that are losers but also the\r\ninternational community. As a result of the increasing\r\nclaims for peacemaking and peacekeeping operations,\r\ndeveloping countries are deprived of much needed\r\ndevelopment resources and are politically weakened.\r\nGradually the United Nations must move forward into the\r\narea of peace-building to obviate recidivism and to\r\nreconstruct shattered societies. By helping to strengthen\r\ndemocracy, government institutions and the rule of law,\r\nas well as rebuilding the foundations for long-term\r\ndevelopment, the Organization can help post-conflict\r\nStates to rebuild themselves.\r\nThe time may have come to revisit the United\r\nNations Agenda for Peace, as well as its Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, to see where deficiencies lie and what\r\ncould be done to remedy them.\r\nThe time has also come to strengthen the Security\r\nCouncil, the organ primarily responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, so that it\r\nmay become more democratic, representative and\r\ncredible. Of course, the United Nations cannot do what\r\nthe parties to conflict are not prepared to do. Without a\r\ntrue commitment to peace by all involved there can be\r\nscant prospect of any lasting settlement. As we have seen\r\nfrom recent developments in the Middle East, the parties\r\ninvolved must show a strong will to resolve the conflict\r\nthrough peaceful means. Only then can the United\r\nNations, using the instruments provided by its Charter,\r\nserve to facilitate negotiations for a satisfactory outcome.\r\nAccompanying these threats to international security\r\nand stability are strong economic and social forces which\r\nimpact negatively on our countries. While globalization\r\nand trade liberalization have benefited strong economies,\r\nthey have also exposed weaker States to marginalization\r\nfrom the world economy. By opening the floodgates of\r\ntrade and finance, globalization has invariably wrought\r\nhavoc on small and weak economies, which can do\r\nprecious little to withstand its impact. Economic and\r\nsocial misery have followed in its wake, exposing the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nparticular vulnerabilities of small developing countries,\r\nmany of which are dependent on a single agricultural crop\r\n— like bananas or sugar — for the livelihood of their\r\npeoples.\r\nAt the regional meetings which have been held thus\r\nfar in preparation for the tenth session of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD\r\nX) caution has been sounded against the worst excesses of\r\ntrade liberalization. Having benefited from the Tokyo and\r\nUruguay Rounds, the industrialized countries are anxious to\r\nhold further negotiations — the mother of all rounds — for\r\nfree trade in the next millennium. Theoretically, developing\r\ncountries can also gain from increased liberalization.\r\nHowever, since they are for the most part too weak to take\r\nadvantage of the new opportunities, they run the risk of\r\ngreater marginalization and, indeed, elimination from the\r\nmarket place.\r\nFear of this eventuality is based not on uninformed\r\nspeculation, but on the harsh reality of experience. Past\r\nnegotiating rounds have yielded significant concessions to\r\ndeveloped economies, while offering relatively little to\r\ndeveloping countries in terms of opening up markets for\r\ntheir own products. At bottom, the problem is one of an\r\nimbalance in negotiating strength of its contracting parties,\r\nresulting in more favourable outcomes for the strongest. Yet\r\nthe developing countries are being urged to enter into a new\r\nround of negotiations, the millennium round, the result of\r\nwhich is likely to be no different from that of the past\r\nunless its agenda is balanced by issues of concern to the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nTo be able to enter the global marketplace, developing\r\ncountries should be assisted in the strengthening of their\r\nproductive capacities and in widening their access to export\r\nmarkets. They need to be assured of stabilization in the\r\ninternational financial and monetary system in order to\r\navoid the hazards of currency fluctuations. Equally\r\nimportant, given the vast disparity which exists in the\r\neconomic capacities of countries, special and differential\r\ntreatment should be granted to developing countries in\r\naccordance with the principles outlined in part IV of the\r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the\r\nGATT legislative clause of 1971.\r\nSpecial consideration will have to be given to Africa,\r\nthe least developed countries and structurally weak\r\neconomies, in particular the small island developing States,\r\nwhich are seriously disadvantaged in the area of trade. The\r\nspecial session to review the Programme of Action with\r\nregard to the sustainable development of small island\r\ndeveloping States, which will be held here in just a matter\r\nof days, and the summit of the least developed countries\r\nscheduled for the year 2001 should serve to generate new\r\ninitiatives to help these vulnerable States.\r\nHowever, to benefit from the international trading\r\nsystem developing countries must receive significant debt\r\nrelief and the necessary official development assistance to\r\nboost the overall productive capability. Consequently, in\r\nthe face of rampant globalization, it is imperative that the\r\ninternational community should come together to create\r\na modern development vision and strategy aimed at\r\nbridging the dangerous division which now separates the\r\nprosperous from the poor nations. This new approach\r\nshould be based on an international consensus on\r\ndevelopment and on the rights and obligations of the\r\npartners.\r\nAs the preparations undertaken this year for the\r\nreview of the summits held in Beijing, Cairo and\r\nCopenhagen have shown, there is an increasing number\r\nof people, the majority of them women and children,\r\nliving under adverse conditions caused by poverty.\r\nDespite great strides in the fields of health and education\r\nin the developed world, many developing countries\r\ncontinue to be plagued by unequal and inadequate access\r\nto education and health care, high infant and maternal\r\nmortality, as well as lack of access to safe drinking water\r\nand proper sanitation. Indeed, low levels of health have\r\ninhibited the achievement of socially and economically\r\nproductive lives, not to mention the devastating social and\r\neconomic impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as well as\r\nmalaria, on a number of developing countries, particularly\r\nin Africa.\r\nThe Cologne initiative to expand the scope and\r\nprovision of relief for the heavily indebted poor countries\r\nwas a welcome step forward. Unfortunately, however, it\r\ndoes not go far enough to alleviate the debt burden which\r\nthe developing countries still bear. Nothing short of the\r\ncancellation of some of these countries\u0027 debts will be\r\nsufficient to improve their circumstances to the point\r\nwhere they can be active participants in the world\r\neconomy. The situation of many low-income countries\r\nhas been made even more acute by the rapid decline of\r\nofficial development assistance in the wake of\r\nglobalization\u0027s spread and over reliance on the market to\r\npromote development.\r\nThe financing of development must therefore be\r\nplaced on a more sound and predictable basis. The Group\r\nof 77 therefore attaches the greatest importance to the\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nholding of a high-level conference by the year 2001 to\r\naddress this pressing issue. We believe that if Member\r\nStates can address all aspects of the problem — particularly\r\nthose identified in the Secretary-General\u0027s report on\r\nfinancing for development — we may yet find solutions\r\nthat are acceptable and effective. Crucial to the successful\r\noutcome of the conference, however, is a general\r\nacceptance of a more enlightened approach to international\r\ndevelopment cooperation based on a genuine concept of\r\ninterdependence and partnership.\r\nIndeed, there is an acute need for a new global agenda\r\nwith the objective of putting a human face on the\r\nmarketplace. Policies aimed merely at creating\r\nunsustainable social safety nets are hardly lasting solutions.\r\nThe root causes of the structural and endemic problems of\r\nthe developing countries, which ultimately lead to global\r\ninstability, must be addressed.\r\nFor their part, the developing countries which\r\nconstitute the Group of 77 are committed to the search for\r\nways and means by which we can accelerate the\r\ndevelopment process. Even before the conference on\r\nfinancing for development, we shall meet in Havana, Cuba,\r\nnext year for the first ever South summit. The Summit is a\r\nlong-cherished idea whose time has finally come. It will\r\nallow the South a special opportunity to examine the impact\r\nwhich globalization continues to have on developing\r\ncountries, as well as the policies and strategies needed to\r\nharness the process and make it more amenable to control.\r\nIn this context, North-South relations must be reviewed to\r\nsee how they may be enhanced and put on a new basis for\r\nmutual trust and advantage.\r\nUnderstandably, the central focus of the South Summit\r\nmust be the strengthening of the unity and solidarity of the\r\nGroup of 77 and the identification of concrete initiatives to\r\npromote practical cooperation between members. We have\r\nalso agreed to devote our attention to the promulgation of\r\nknowledge and technology in order, hopefully, to achieve\r\na quantum leap towards our development. This, after all, is\r\nan area in which the South can boast of remarkable\r\nadvances and of many centres of excellence that can be\r\nutilized for the dissemination of skills and technology\r\namong the countries of the Group of 77. The North can, of\r\ncourse, do much to facilitate these exchanges by providing\r\nrequisite financing and supplying appropriate technology\r\nand knowledge that would make the developing countries\r\nmore self-reliant and at the same time more competitive in\r\nthe world economy.\r\nComing, as it does, in the early months of the new\r\nmillennium, the South summit will certainly provide an\r\nindication of the direction for the future. In Havana we\r\nhope to have in attendance our developed partners, which\r\nsignificantly, are usually present at all of our important\r\ndeliberations as observers. Also expected to participate in\r\nthe event are other key players in the development\r\nprocess, such as our non-governmental organizations and\r\nrepresentatives of the private sector. Together, through an\r\ninteractive dialogue, we hope to forge a programme of\r\naction which will serve as a catalyst for the development\r\nof our countries and our peoples. Indeed, if given the\r\nchance, the South summit, I dare say, will prove to be an\r\ninspiration for the Millennium Assembly and for a new\r\ncompact on human development for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nSpeaking for Guyana, I wish to reaffirm our\r\nGovernment\u0027s intention to continue working for the\r\ncreation of a new global human order aimed at the\r\neradication of poverty and the establishment of a just and\r\nmore humane system of international relations. Conceived\r\nby our late President Cheddi Jagan, whose entire life was\r\ndedicated to empowering the poor and the weak — not\r\nonly in his native Guyana, but throughout the world —\r\nthe outlines of this new order have been presented at\r\nmajor international forums, including the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, which was held in 1995 in\r\nDenmark. All 14 heads of Government of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM), along with other world leaders\r\nand eminent personalities, have declared their full support\r\nfor the proposal and their commitment to its widest\r\npromulgation. We will therefore seek at this session to\r\nadvance it for further consideration.\r\nAlthough much is being made of the dawning of the\r\nmillennium, it is obviously too much to expect that it will\r\nbring solutions to all of the world\u0027s problems. It can\r\nprovide, however, an auspicious opportunity for the\r\ninternational community to reflect upon the past\r\nachievements, its present challenges and future\r\naspirations. With a firm sense of purpose and resolve, let\r\nus use this occasion to create a brave new world in which\r\nall our peoples may hope to live in peace — free from\r\nfear, poverty and want.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Guyana\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nMr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Janez Drnovsek, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Slovenia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Drnovsek, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nSlovenia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming the\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia, Mr. Janez\r\nDrnovsek, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Drnovsek (Slovenia): Let me take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate you, Sir, and your country,\r\nNamibia, on your election as President of the fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that your\r\nexperience and diplomatic skills will help this General\r\nAssembly to fulfil its important tasks. I would also like to\r\nthank the outgoing President, Mr. Didier Opertti of\r\nUruguay, for the guidance he provided to the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to warmly welcome\r\nthe Republic of Nauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga, which have just joined the United\r\nNations family.\r\nWe are gathered here at the threshold not just of a\r\nnew century but of a new millennium. It is appropriate,\r\ntherefore, that we take advantage of this important occasion\r\nto reflect upon our situation in the world today. I speak\r\nhere not of our situation as individuals or even as nations,\r\nbut as a race.\r\nThere are many signs of progress, and there are\r\nreasons for hope. However, the ultimate goal of world\r\npeace still seems elusive. The number of conflicts is\r\nsignificantly increasing. All over the world, millions of\r\ncivilians are the victims of well-planned and systematic\r\npolicies of killing, displacement, property destruction and\r\nintimidation. At the end of last year, the number of people\r\nworldwide who had been evicted from their homes stood\r\nat more than 21 million.\r\nEast Timor and Kosovo are just two tragic examples\r\nof typical cases of contemporary armed conflicts. These\r\nare conflicts frequently take place within what the outside\r\nworld recognizes as State borders, rather than between\r\npreviously established States. Today, these types of wars\r\namount to more than 90 per cent of those raging in the\r\nworld.\r\nTo make matters even worse, the number of civilians\r\nkilled in these nominally “internal” wars is sharply\r\nincreasing. A new kind of warfare is developing in which\r\ncivilians are a primary strategic target. “Ethnic cleansing”,\r\nmassacres and a horrifying variety of war crimes have\r\nbecome weapons for achieving political, economic and\r\nmilitary goals. Ethnic, religious, national and social\r\ninequalities are frequently used as a smokescreen to hide\r\nthe reality of massacre and conquest from the rest of the\r\nworld. Furthermore, these inequalities are exploited by\r\nruthless leaders, who use them as a tool to achieve very\r\nconcrete aims. We have seen this phenomenon in almost\r\nall of the armed conflicts of recent times — in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, Kosovo, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Afghanistan\r\nand, most recently, in East Timor.\r\nHow should the international community react to\r\ngross violations of human rights — violations that amount\r\nto threats to international peace and security? When and\r\nhow can the international community seek to establish\r\nthat a sovereign Government cannot, or does not want to,\r\nprevent a humanitarian catastrophe? When and by what\r\ncriteria does it decide to use its instruments of\r\nenforcement?\r\nAll United Nations Member States must think hard\r\nabout these questions. We are grateful to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who made, at the beginning of this debate, a\r\nsignificant contribution to such thinking.\r\nThis turn-of-the-century crime wave cries out for\r\nnew approaches and new ways of protecting vulnerable\r\ncivilian populations. Armed conflicts have in fact become\r\na problem for humankind, not just for the nation or\r\nnations directly concerned.\r\nThe international community must innovate as it\r\nseeks to solve these pressing humanitarian problems. Our\r\nbasic aim has to be human security, and here I mean\r\nphysical and not just legal security. Slovenia welcomes\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nand participates in the initiatives of like-minded countries\r\nwhich are determined to give full meaning and specific\r\npractical expression to the concept of human security. In\r\naddition, as one answer to these challenges, new and more\r\nsophisticated concepts of peacekeeping operations are being\r\ndeveloped. New methods of conflict prevention should also\r\nbe explored. Preventive diplomacy, preventive deployment,\r\npreventive disarmament and post-conflict peace-building are\r\nthe orders of the day.\r\nWe have to ensure respect for human rights. We are\r\nfirm in our belief that a determined commitment to promote\r\nand protect human rights has to be an underlying principle\r\nfor the activities of the United Nations at the threshold of\r\nthe new millennium. We have to create conditions for good\r\ngovernance, the rule of law, sustainable development and\r\nsocial justice. All of these tasks and many others require\r\ncreative thinking and bold action. Solving these thorny\r\nproblems is a prerequisite for peace and prosperity. This is\r\nalso the way to prevent conditions which directly feed the\r\nflames of the conflicts that I have described.\r\nAs an elected member of the Security Council, we are\r\ncontributing to the maintenance of world peace and\r\nsecurity. We are cooperating actively in the resolution of\r\ncrises in South-Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America\r\nand the Middle East. We believe that special importance\r\nshould be attached to preventive action in situations posing\r\na potential threat to international peace but which have not\r\nyet developed into armed conflict. Where situations have\r\nalready escalated into armed conflict, no effort should be\r\nspared in finding a peaceful and timely resolution. We\r\nrecognize the recent Security Council mission to Jakarta\r\nand Dili, in which Slovenia took part, as an innovative\r\napproach by the United Nations in dealing with crisis\r\nsituations. Clearly, we welcome this.\r\nFinally, in post-conflict situations, such as Kosovo,\r\ncontinued coordinated action by the international\r\ncommunity is necessary. It is only by working in concert\r\nthat the United Nations, regional organizations and other\r\ninternational players can be effective. Only in this way can\r\nthe difficult goals that have been set be achieved. These\r\ngoals include bringing political and economic stabilization,\r\ndemocratization, the protection of human rights to the\r\nterritory in question and establishing a functional legal\r\nsystem there.\r\nThe changing nature of armed conflicts is also\r\nchanging the role of the Security Council as it discharges\r\nits primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We note the increased\r\nreadiness and determination of regional organizations to\r\ntake on their share of responsibility for the maintenance\r\nof regional peace and security. As many examples of\r\nfruitful collaboration attest, relations between the Security\r\nCouncil and these regional organizations are relations not\r\nof competition but rather of cooperation. We therefore\r\ncommend the increased role of regional organizations\r\nunder Chapter VIII of the Charter.\r\nLet me continue by presenting some elements that\r\nwe must consider in any international response to the\r\nchanging nature of armed conflicts. There is an\r\nunacceptably wide — even a growing — gap between the\r\nexisting norms of international humanitarian and human\r\nrights law and common situations on the ground: human\r\nrights are frequently and openly violated. Determined and\r\nunited action by the international community is needed to\r\nensure that the existing norms of human rights are fully\r\nobserved.\r\nThose who commit war crimes and crimes against\r\nhumanity must be brought to justice. This is primarily the\r\nresponsibility of States, which must act both individually\r\nthrough their national systems of justice, and collectively\r\nthrough an effective international justice system. Failure\r\nto act is no more and no less than an invitation to those\r\ncapable of creating new, even more serious cycles of\r\nhuman tragedy to do just that.\r\nWhether there is to be human progress and\r\ndevelopment depends on the result of this confrontation\r\nbetween the rule of international law and those who stand\r\nto benefit directly from lawlessness. International\r\nindifference can only reward such people. In this regard,\r\nSlovenia attaches particular importance to the need to\r\nensure more effective, comprehensive and efficient\r\ndelivery of international justice. We are supportive of the\r\ntwo existing United Nations International Criminal\r\nTribunals and of the ongoing process designed to give\r\nbirth to a permanent International Criminal Court. To this\r\nend we have begun the legislative procedures necessary\r\nto ratify the Rome Statute. We are also contributing to\r\nefforts to complete the mandate of the Preparatory\r\nCommission for the International Criminal Court.\r\nPeacekeeping operations have in recent years\r\nbecome increasingly multidimensional: they encompass\r\nnot only demanding military tasks but also a variety of\r\nother functions, such as civilian police activities, support\r\nfor humanitarian assistance, practical disarmament\r\nmeasures, demobilization and integration of former\r\ncombatants, and enhancing and monitoring human rights.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nI should like to avail myself of this important occasion\r\nto affirm that Slovenia considers peacekeeping to be one of\r\nthe key instruments available to the United Nations in\r\ndischarging its responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We have increased our\r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping operations —\r\nand are committed to further increasing our participation in\r\nthe near future — not only in terms of military personnel\r\nbut also of civilian police and humanitarian aid workers.\r\nDisarmament efforts are a vital ingredient in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The\r\nachievements of past years have been considerable,\r\nespecially in such areas as chemical weapons and the\r\ncomprehensive ban on nuclear weapon testing. However,\r\nthere is a need to strengthen disarmament work, in the area\r\nnot only of weapons of mass destruction but also in\r\nreducing flows of conventional arms. We hope that the\r\nConference on Disarmament will be strengthened as an\r\neffective disarmament negotiation body. We also hope that\r\nthe forthcoming Review Conference of the Parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\r\nwill represent a decisive step in the strengthening of the\r\nnon-proliferation regime, and that progress will be made\r\ntowards the objective of nuclear disarmament.\r\nI strongly believe that States Members of the United\r\nNations and the international community as a whole must\r\ncontinue efforts to strengthen the prohibition of land mines,\r\nwhich is one specific front in protecting the physical\r\nsecurity to which I referred. Last year our Government\r\nestablished an International Trust Fund for Demining and\r\nMine Victim Assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our\r\naim is to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and other mine-\r\naffected countries in the region get rid of those lethal,\r\nhidden weapons, and to help those who have been wounded\r\nby them. In only the first year of its existence, the\r\nInternational Trust Fund has achieved many positive results\r\nin Bosnia; it is now extending its activities to Kosovo.\r\nThere are many ways in which United Nations\r\nMember States can contribute to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. I would like to point out\r\nthat Slovenia has joined a number of other nations in\r\ncommitting itself to tackling the security challenges of\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe. In establishing the Stability Pact, the\r\ninternational community has formed a framework intended\r\nto enable the concerted and sustained action necessary to\r\nstabilize the region. If it lives up to its early promise —\r\nand we intend to work hard to make sure that it does — the\r\nStability Pact could be the key factor in bringing lasting\r\npeace, economic recovery and development to a very\r\ntroubled neighbourhood. That such a wide range of States\r\nand international organizations — not least the United\r\nNations — have committed themselves to helping in this\r\nvery ambitious task gives us grounds for hope.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to return to the question\r\nwith which I started: at the end of the millennium, how\r\ndoes the human race stand? Are there grounds for hope?\r\nDo we have the institutions and strategies needed to deal\r\nwith our problems? If not, can we modify and redesign\r\nthem? Even in the face of tragic conflicts, I believe that\r\nthe answer to these questions must be “yes”.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nSlovenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Janez Drnovsek, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I call now on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Papua New Guinea, His Excellency\r\nThe Honourable Sir Michael Somare.\r\nSir Michael Somare (Papua New Guinea): On\r\nbehalf of the people and the Government of Papua New\r\nGuinea, I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. His unanimous\r\nelection shows the esteem in which the international\r\ncommunity holds him personally, and his country,\r\nNamibia. The Papua New Guinea delegation is confident\r\nthat he will guide the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly to a successful conclusion. My congratulations\r\ngo also to the other Assembly officers.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to express my\r\ndelegation\u0027s sincere appreciation to his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti, for his outstanding\r\nstewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-third\r\nsession.\r\nWe would also like to place on record our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his diplomatic\r\nskill and for the leadership he has provided on major\r\nissues of international concern. I must also congratulate\r\nthe Secretariat staff for the tremendous work they put into\r\nthe discharge of their functions and duties, at times under\r\nvery difficult and dangerous circumstances.\r\nLike others who have spoken before me, I too\r\ncongratulate on behalf of the people and the Government\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nof Papua New Guinea the three new Member States, all\r\nfrom the South Pacific Forum region — the Republic of\r\nNauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga\r\n— and welcome them into the United Nations family. I\r\nwould also like to pay tribute to all Member States which\r\nmade their admission possible. This is an Organization in\r\nwhich smallness in terms of population or size should not\r\nbe a handicap. I am confident that the work of the United\r\nNations will only be enhanced through the sharing of the\r\nparticular experiences and knowledge that these three new\r\nMembers will bring.\r\nIt has only been a little over two months since the new\r\nGovernment, of which I am a part, was elected to office in\r\nmy country. But this time has been hectic and very\r\nchallenging. The Government has been confronted with\r\nproblems inherited from previous Governments over the last\r\n23 years of our independence and especially over the last\r\ntwo years. These have been compounded by other problems\r\nassociated with the recent downturn in the global economy,\r\nwith the economic crisis in the Asia-Pacific region and with\r\nnatural disasters, all of which we have little control over.\r\nThis experience, together with my country\u0027s location\r\nand its close relations with other countries in the region,\r\ndefines my Government\u0027s foreign policy focus on\r\npartnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. This point has been\r\nbrought home by a series of natural disasters which have\r\naffected Papua New Guinea over the last 10 years. There\r\nhave been 30 of them in that decade. The droughts, floods,\r\nbush fires, cyclones, frosts, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,\r\ntsunamis and landslides have shown that peoples and States\r\nthroughout the world have to be partners in dealing with the\r\ncauses and consequences of such disasters, and must\r\nmanifest preparedness to take responsive and remedial\r\nmeasures. There must be a global partnership in developing\r\nappropriate mechanisms for disaster prevention and disaster\r\nreduction.\r\nWhen my Government came into office on 14 July\r\nthis year, it had five main priorities. These are: restoring\r\nintegrity to the institutions of the State; stabilizing the\r\nexchange rate of our currency, the kina, and containing\r\ninflation and reestablishing constructive dialogue with\r\nPapua New Guinea\u0027s development partners; restoring\r\nstability to the national budget, focusing on fewer and more\r\nimportant priority areas and advancing the privatization of\r\nsome of our public institutions for a fair run; creating better\r\nconditions for the private sector by removing barriers to\r\ninvestment growth; and continuing the Bougainville peace\r\nprocess.\r\nMy Government has addressed these challenges,\r\nincluding a comprehensive programme of structural\r\nadjustment through the mini-budget recently adopted by\r\nParliament. In doing so, we are working hard to make\r\nsure that a strong and efficient private sector can\r\ncontribute to public welfare and national development. By\r\nthe same token we are also reviewing the size and\r\neffectiveness of the public sector to make it more\r\nresponsive to the desires and aspirations of our people.\r\nThe results, together with other measures we have\r\nadopted, will, we hope, stabilize the economy, thereby\r\nstimulating economic growth. The signs are very\r\nencouraging.\r\nI know that as a small open economy, my country\u0027s\r\ndevelopment is directly influenced by global factors,\r\nincluding world market prices for our products. Currently,\r\nmy country is suffering from the economic crisis\r\nexperienced by our major trading partners in Asia, and we\r\nare forced to undertake significant reform programmes to\r\nprotect our economy and our people. In this regard, we\r\nturn to international financial institutions to help us\r\nrestructure our economy. The World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the Asian Development\r\nBank have been very positive in their responses to our\r\npolicies, especially my Government\u0027s recent mini-budget\r\nlast month.\r\nI held bilateral discussions with friends such as\r\nAustralia, China, Japan and New Zealand two weeks ago\r\nduring the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\r\nministerial meeting in Auckland, New Zealand. They\r\nindicated their support for the current structural\r\nadjustment programmes my Government has introduced.\r\nFor Papua New Guinea to realize and sustain its current\r\nreform programmes, it has to secure external financial\r\nsupport.\r\nI see my Government\u0027s foreign policy of partnership\r\nin the Asia-Pacific region as a building block for the\r\nglobal partnership on which the future of my people\r\ndepends. There is really no other alternative.\r\nOn peacemaking and peacekeeping, the Bougainville\r\nconflict involves substantial commitments of personnel\r\nand funds by the Government of Papua New Guinea, by\r\nneighbouring countries and by the United Nations. My\r\nGovernment acknowledges and is deeply grateful for the\r\nconstructive role played by Australia, Fiji, New Zealand,\r\nthe Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as well as by the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and a number of\r\nnon-governmental organizations including churches and\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nthe Red Cross. We are also grateful that the Security\r\nCouncil found it possible to answer our request to send an\r\nobserver mission to ensure that the parties involved in the\r\npeace process continue to honour the Lincoln Agreement.\r\nWe note the reference to Bougainville in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report on the work of the Organization.\r\nAs peace continues to be consolidated on the ground,\r\nso the role and size of the neutral regional Peace\r\nMonitoring Group can be expected to change. Re-\r\nestablishment of police, courts and correctional services will\r\nprovide important supports and benchmarks for progress\r\ntowards lasting peace on the island. In the event that the\r\nBougainville parties are unable to resolve the constitutional\r\narrangements before the end of this year, we hope that at\r\nthe appropriate time the Security Council will agree to an\r\nextension of the mandate of the United Nations mission on\r\nBougainville.\r\nI pay tribute to all United Nations Member States, and\r\nespecially to those current and immediate past members of\r\nthe Security Council, for responding positively and for their\r\ncontinued support for a peaceful resolution of our\r\nBougainville crisis.\r\nConsistent with our commitment to peaceful dialogue\r\nbetween nations, Papua New Guinea condemns those who\r\nemploy terrorism against innocent people and who finance,\r\nrecruit, train and deploy terrorists and mercenaries.\r\nIn 1975, when I addressed this forum from this\r\npodium at the time of our admission to the United Nations,\r\nI committed Papua New Guinea to the principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter. Now, some 24\r\nyears later, we recognize that like any other institution, the\r\nUnited Nations has limitations. We believe that after 50\r\nyears the time is right to review the Charter, taking into\r\naccount today\u0027s realities.\r\nThe Charter should be a document that puts the people\r\nof the world on centre stage, and at the same time it must\r\nrecognize that the Governments are here to represent them\r\nas well as to serve them. In this respect, there cannot be\r\nany distinction as to colour, creed, race, sex or religious\r\npersuasion.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\ncurrent and ongoing reform programme. As a member of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, my delegation reaffirms the\r\nposition that the Security Council should be reformed and\r\nexpanded in both categories, taking into account today\u0027s\r\nrealities. My delegation believes the numbers in the Council\r\nshould reflect the increased United Nations membership,\r\nand therefore I concur with the majority of Member\r\nStates who have advocated a Security Council of the new\r\nmillennium consisting of 26 or more members.\r\nPapua New Guinea believes that all permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, including new\r\npermanent members, should have similar privileges and\r\nrights. The use of the veto power should be done away\r\nwith, or curtailed and applied only to Chapter VII issues.\r\nThe working methods of the Council should be more\r\ntransparent.\r\nThe reforms of the Organization would not be\r\ncomplete without the reconfiguration of the regional\r\ngroupings within the United Nations structure. My\r\nGovernment believes that an effective Security Council\r\nshould be composed of a representative from each\r\nsubregion of the world. In this regard, due consideration\r\nshould be given to current realities, especially to the\r\ngeographical location of each Member State. For example,\r\nin the reformulation Australia and New Zealand should be\r\nconsidered as part of the South Pacific subregion of the\r\nAsian group. The reforms in the Security Council should\r\ntherefore take account of this change.\r\nChanging the world, through decolonization, from a\r\nsystem of relations between imperial powers and the\r\ncolonized to a partnership between sovereign States is\r\namong the United Nations greatest achievements. The\r\nprocess, however, will not be complete until the\r\nremaining 17 non-self-governing territories have exercised\r\ntheir inalienable right to self-determination and/or\r\nachieved self-government and, where appropriate,\r\nindependence. Neither small size nor remoteness should\r\nbe allowed to qualify or limit this inalienable right.\r\nOn the regional front, Papua New Guinea is pleased\r\nto note the progress made in implementing the Matignon\r\nAccords, culminating in the recent agreement contained\r\nin the Noumea Accord, which confirms the way forward\r\nfor the exercise of the right of self-determination by the\r\npeople of New Caledonia, especially the indigenous\r\nKanak people. The Noumea Accord will, we believe,\r\nprovide a sound basis for the future fulfilment of all\r\nlegitimate political aspirations. We urge all parties to\r\nhonour both its letter and spirit.\r\nWe acknowledge that the United Nations Decade for\r\nDecolonization will come to an end next year. We urge\r\nthe administering Powers and the members of the Special\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nCommittee to work together to develop a new programme\r\nof action for the year 2000 and beyond.\r\nOn East Timor, my Government welcomed the\r\nagreement between the Republic of Indonesia, the\r\nPortuguese Republic and the United Nations on 5 May\r\n1999, which enabled the United Nations to organize the\r\nballot on 30 August. The overwhelming 98.6 per cent\r\nturnout at the ballot and the 78.2 per cent vote in favour of\r\nindependence are very clear.\r\nMy Government calls on all parties to respect the\r\nresults of the United Nations-supervised ballot and the\r\nwishes of the East Timorese people. Although since the\r\nballot there have been deaths, massive destruction of\r\nproperty and the undemocratic and forced displacement of\r\npeople by the militias and certain members of the\r\nIndonesian military who did not accept the results, we are\r\npleased that this has changed after the recent announcement\r\nby the President of the Republic of Indonesia, B. J.\r\nHabibie, reaffirmed by Foreign Minister Alatas yesterday.\r\nDemocracy is all about the will of the majority. It is not\r\nabout unanimity, nor is it about enforced application of\r\nrules by a minority.\r\nWe are also pleased that the Government of Indonesia\r\nwas able to recognise its obligations — not only as a party\r\nto the 5 May Agreement, but also as a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations — to permit the deployment of a Security\r\nCouncil-sanctioned multinational peacekeeping force in East\r\nTimor.\r\nAt the same time, however, it is our fervent hope that\r\nin the interests of the long-term security and stability of the\r\nregion, the leaders and the people of East Timor will also\r\nmake peace with their neighbours. It is important for them\r\nto acknowledge the fact that it was the Government of\r\nIndonesia that made it possible for the people to exercise\r\ntheir right to self-determination.\r\nWe are firmly committed to the Barbados Programme\r\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, including issues of climate change and\r\nthe consequent effects of rising sea levels. We strongly urge\r\nits full implementation. My Government will continue to\r\nfollow and support the future work on these issues,\r\nincluding the special session of the General Assembly on\r\nsmall island developing States to be held on 27 and 28\r\nSeptember 1999. The world\u0027s leading scientists have\r\nconcluded that the rise in global temperatures poses serious\r\nthreats, including sea-level rise and an increase in natural\r\ncatastrophes such as the El Niño and La Niña phenomena.\r\nThe greatest challenge for the United Nations is to\r\nstrengthen the global community\u0027s capacity to respond\r\npromptly and effectively to natural disasters. The\r\ndevastation caused by the recent earthquakes in Taiwan\r\nand Turkey and by the floods in the United States and in\r\nthe Bahamas resulting from hurricane Floyd makes it all\r\nthe more imperative for the international community to\r\ntake positive action.\r\nOn the question of the management of the oceans\r\nand seas, Papua New Guinea joins others in calling on\r\nMember States at this session of the General Assembly to\r\nwork together on a resolution to establish a consultative\r\nprocess to improve coordination and management of the\r\nprogrammes for the protection of the oceans and seas. At\r\nthis Assembly session we should formalize this process.\r\nWe are concerned that at the recent meeting of the\r\nCouncil of the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica,\r\na number of States appeared to be more preoccupied with\r\nreducing our potential to prosper from prospecting,\r\nexploring and exploiting the deep seabed. The debate in\r\nJamaica clearly reflected that the States with stringent\r\nenvironmental guidelines no longer endorse the principle\r\nof a global commons. They now find themselves caught\r\nup in a conflict of interest in which their role as guardians\r\nof the global commons is now being overshadowed by\r\ntheir desire to grab the benefits for themselves, with little\r\nor no sense of obligation to the world community at\r\nlarge.\r\nWe have also noted a tendency by countries that\r\nhave co-sponsored pioneer investors in deep-sea mining\r\nto try to avoid their international obligations towards the\r\nenvironment. We are particularly concerned that they have\r\nplaced the interests of investors above the interests of the\r\nglobal community. We make particular mention of the\r\ntrend to withhold information from the International\r\nSeabed Authority under the guise of “confidentiality”,\r\n“proprietary interests”, and “information of a scientifically\r\nsensitive nature”: these are merely codes for denying\r\nglobal communities access to information that might\r\nallow them to prepare better for disaster prevention and\r\nother actions needed to protect the environment.\r\nRegarding nuclear issues, Papua New Guinea,\r\nconsistent with our shared commitment to a stable,\r\npeaceful and environmentally safe world, supports the\r\nobjectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty. Together with our partners in the South\r\nPacific Forum, we continue to reaffirm our commitment\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nto maintaining the South Pacific region as a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone. We also express our support for the\r\nother regional nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa, South-\r\nEast Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, and also\r\nfor the proposed new initiatives for Central and South Asia.\r\nWe call on all nuclear-weapon and threshold States to\r\nstop all testing, manufacturing and stockpiling of these\r\nweapons and to take steps towards the destruction of all\r\nnuclear weapons. Indeed, the same principle should apply\r\nto all weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe South Pacific Forum members have always\r\nmaintained that we have a right to ban transboundary\r\nmovements of radioactive and other hazardous wastes,\r\nwithin and through the region. We also continue to share\r\nthe position that appropriate compensatory mechanisms\r\nshould be established to compensate victims of past nuclear\r\ntests and provide compensation for damage resulting from\r\nany accidents.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm that Papua New\r\nGuinea is firmly committed to the United Nations Charter;\r\nto the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General, especially\r\nthose relating to the Security Council and the\r\nreconfiguration of the regional groups within the United\r\nNations system; and to the United Nations decolonization\r\nprocess and the Nouméa Accord for the Kanak people of\r\nNew Caledonia. We support the determination of the United\r\nNations to work towards a global mechanism for natural-\r\ndisaster preparedness and prevention; the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly for the review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates; and the management of the oceans and seas.\r\nPartnership in promoting change is the key to\r\naddressing the challenges that the world will face in the\r\ntwenty-first century. I believe that the challenge for all\r\nMember States is to join together to bring about\r\ntransparency, accountability and good governance as the\r\nbasic tenets of this Organization, its organs and subsidiary\r\nbodies. If this is achieved, the “people first” sentiment of\r\nthe United Nations Charter will be truly embraced.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, His Excellency Mr.\r\nJozias van Aartsen.\r\nMr. van Aartsen (Netherlands): Speaking to the\r\nAssembly one year ago, I demonstrated that the Kingdom\r\nof the Netherlands qualified for membership on the Security\r\nCouncil. During the elections two weeks later a\r\nsubstantial majority of this body supported us, and we are\r\ngrateful to them. As the Netherlands has served on the\r\nCouncil now for more than eight months and is currently\r\nits President, I think it is only fair for me to report to all\r\nthe Assembly members who showed confidence in us. I\r\nwish to speak on Africa, on the Council, and on shifting\r\nour attention from the State to the people.\r\nMost of today\u0027s armed conflicts are in Africa. From\r\nSierra Leone to Eritrea and from the Sudan to the Congo\r\nand Angola, Africans are fighting Africans. Fighting\r\naccompanies all the plights and pains that are known to\r\nhumankind, from poverty and pestilence to famine, fear\r\nand flight.\r\nAfrica is not a land of troubles alone but also of\r\nhappiness, not a continent only of catastrophe but also\r\none of hope. The sheer mass of Africa\u0027s problems\r\nobscures our view of its promise and its potential. In the\r\npublic mind, an unbalanced view of Africa prevails. That\r\nview, I feel, needs to be corrected: we need to rid\r\nourselves of prejudice and think positively. Instead of\r\ndejection, we need a deepening commitment. Africa,\r\ndespite the odds, has come a long way already.\r\nPersonally, I was struck, at the opening of the general\r\ndebate, by the sight of an African President of South\r\nAfrica, speaking in front of an African President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, seated next to an African Secretary-\r\nGeneral. It is hard to miss the symbolism of that image.\r\nIt is one image the founding fathers of this Organization\r\nmight not have had, one image that by itself already holds\r\na promise for the future: the next century may well be the\r\ncentury of Africa.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report on Africa, has\r\nmade a link between conflict and prosperity. For this\r\nreason, my delegation felt that members of the Council\r\nwould be well advised to consider this question in some\r\ndepth, and, in our presidential capacity, we have therefore\r\norganized an open-ended public debate, to be held next\r\nweek, in which the Secretary-General will brief us on the\r\nstate of Africa.\r\nLet me now turn to the question of how to improve\r\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations, and the Security\r\nCouncil in particular, in coping with crisis situations. On\r\nmany occasions in its lifetime, I have admired the United\r\nNations for the way it intervened in emergencies. In\r\nparticular, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United\r\nNations Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nProgramme have enjoyed a long tradition of being in the\r\nforefront. Many non-governmental organizations, such as\r\nMédecins Sans Frontières and the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross (ICRC), have stood there right beside\r\nthem.\r\nLet me pose a number of questions on how the\r\nSecurity Council performs in emergencies. First, do we not\r\nsee a crisis coming before it breaks? Do we not have early\r\nwarning systems? Of course we do. The call for\r\nestablishing early warning systems has been around for\r\ndecades; it has become a buzzword used whenever the\r\ninadequacies of the United Nations response machinery are\r\nbeing discussed. But in fact, given the level of\r\ncommunications in modern times, policy planners have\r\nplenty of information to be forward-looking. It is not the\r\nfailing of an early warning system that can be put to blame,\r\nnor the lack of data. It is, instead, the failure of decision-\r\nmakers to react adequately.\r\nSecond question: Why, then, does the United Nations\r\nreact inadequately? Do we not have preventive diplomacy?\r\nWe do, not only in terms of bilateral efforts of major\r\nnations or of the good offices of the Secretary-General; the\r\nCouncil itself can be proactive. The recent mission it\r\ndispatched to East Timor is a good example of how the\r\nCouncil can be more assertive. Missions are an existing\r\ninstrument that is, in my opinion, in need of an upgrade. In\r\naddition, the open debate on East Timor in the Council, at\r\nwhich everybody spoke plain language, fuelled the\r\nmounting international pressure on Indonesia.\r\nThird question: Is the problem, perhaps, the veto? I\r\nknow this is a popular view, but it is also a tenuous one.\r\nTrue, we cannot ignore the veto as a factor in the Council\u0027s\r\nperformance record. True again, in our discussions on\r\nreform of the Council, the veto is a core element we will\r\none day have to come to grips with. Yet, the problem is an\r\nintractable one. Tampering with the veto may itself create\r\nthe risk of dissolution for the United Nations as a whole.\r\nThe very fact that a single Member State can hold the\r\nentire world community in limbo in the face of harrowing\r\nbrutalities is affecting the stature and moral force of the\r\nOrganization. That, too, may be spawning dissolution. It\r\nmay be argued that, without the veto, the United Nations\r\nwould not have survived its first 50 years. It may also be\r\nargued that, with the veto, the United Nations will not\r\nsurvive the next 50 years. In the first 50 years, the\r\nOrganization might have fallen apart if the veto had not\r\nbeen there as a buffer against the push and pull of a bipolar\r\nworld. In the second 50 years, in a multipolar world,\r\nrepeated inaction by the Security Council would result in\r\nparallel actions outside the United Nations framework,\r\npushing the Organization, as a custodian of world peace,\r\nmore and more into the margins.\r\nNo matter when or how the debate on the veto will\r\nend, this Assembly should meanwhile call on those who\r\npossess it to exercise maximum restraint, particularly in\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. I concur with my German\r\ncolleague that the permanent five are duty-bound to\r\nexplain to the world why they are blocking action by the\r\nCouncil. Moreover, we might consider a situation in\r\nwhich a negative vote by a permanent member does not\r\nin itself block action.\r\nFourth question: Does the problem lie in the political\r\nwill, perhaps? To simply say that the political will has\r\nbeen lacking is not only a platitude, but also a very partial\r\nview of reality. For part of that reality is that images of\r\nall the conflicts on the globe travel around the world with\r\nthe speed of light. The media broadcasts live images of\r\nhuman suffering. Understandably, such images rouse\r\nindignation and horror among millions of viewers. They\r\nexpect instant action. As people are being better informed\r\nabout current events, their level of expectation rises. The\r\ngap between what is expected and what is possible\r\nbecomes more visible and more acute. By contrast,\r\ndiplomacy comes with tools that may be old and\r\nrespectable, but are also solid and slow. And so, while in\r\na globalizing world human misery is disseminated along\r\nthe electronic highway, diplomacy today still proceeds\r\nalong a footpath.\r\nThis leaves me with the central question: Why is the\r\nCouncil often running behind reality? How can we make\r\nit catch up with developments?\r\nAs I look back at the general debate this week, I\r\nthink that we are getting very close to identifying the\r\nmain obstacle. I know that many interventions share a\r\ncommon element — they compare the notion of\r\nsovereignty to that of human rights and territorial integrity\r\nto humanitarian intervention. To be sure, the question per\r\nse is as old as the Charter itself. What is new is the\r\nvenue. I cannot recall that Foreign Ministers at the\r\nGeneral Assembly have talked about this question at any\r\nlength before. I strongly believe that this issue was bound\r\nto surface at this level at some point or another.\r\nIn 1945, the architects of this Organization included\r\ntwo contradictory premises: respect for territorial integrity\r\nand political independence, on the one hand; and respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms, on the other.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nThe world in those days was ruled by Governments alone,\r\nand so the United Nations was made up of States. At the\r\ntime, the notion of human rights, although grafted onto the\r\nCharter with much conviction, was essentially at odds with\r\nclassical legal thinking. In a way, the tension became even\r\nmore pronounced at the adoption of the Universal\r\nDeclaration. After all, for half a millennium the notion of\r\nsovereignty had served as the basis of our global political\r\narchitecture. As the idea was enshrined in the Charter, the\r\nfounding fathers believed it would stand the test of time.\r\nBy contrast, the idea of human rights in international\r\nrelations was, for the most part, a post-war novelty. Indeed,\r\nthe Charter is much more specific on respect for\r\nsovereignty than on respect for human rights.\r\nSince 1945, the world has witnessed a gradual shift in\r\nthat balance, making respect for human rights more and\r\nmore mandatory and respect for sovereignty less and less\r\nstringent. An elaborate body of international human rights\r\nlaw has come to counterbalance the dictates of paragraphs\r\n4 and 7 of Article 2. Today, human rights have come to\r\noutrank sovereignty. Increasingly, the prevailing\r\ninterpretation of the Charter is that it aims to protect\r\nindividual human beings, not to protect those who abuse\r\nthem. Today, we regard it as a generally accepted rule of\r\ninternational law that no sovereign State has the right to\r\nterrorize its own citizens. Indeed, if the Charter were to be\r\nwritten today, there would be an Article 2.8 saying that\r\nnothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize\r\nMember States to terrorize their own people.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nLet me go one step further. The blurring of the\r\nboundaries of sovereignty does not stop at human rights. In\r\nthe future, the notion of sovereignty is going to be tested\r\nbeyond that. Think of decrepit nuclear installations, massive\r\ndamage to the environment, lack of water or mass\r\nmarketing of narcotic drugs. Can responsible statesmen\r\nafford to wait until the damage is actually done? Or do they\r\nin fact have a duty to prevent it? These are questions\r\nwhich, at some point, the Security Council will have to be\r\ninvolved in.\r\nIt is not the lack of early warning, not the absence of\r\npreventive diplomacy, not the veto per se. I call on every\r\npolitician and every diplomat in this room to accept that the\r\ntraditional balance between sovereignty and human rights,\r\nbetween the State and the people is shifting. I am\r\nconvinced this is one of the paramount issues of our time.\r\nMomentum is building, and we should seize it. Let us put\r\nthe issue squarely on the agenda: the agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations, of the Council and of our parliaments at\r\nhome. I ask the legal community to keep a keen eye on\r\nthe groundswell that is developing and to be innovative in\r\nits thinking. We politicians have a vast responsibility\r\nhere. We should steer the discussion towards the people\r\ninstead of the State.\r\nThe Security Council should be stronger, not weaker.\r\nIt should be a credible leader in the maintenance of\r\npeace. In order to be credible, it must be consistent, swift\r\nand proactive. It must show courage, drive and vision. It\r\nmust keep changing with the times. It must put people\r\nover politics. That is a tall order. Its decision on East\r\nTimor gave us hope for the Council\u0027s potential.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Russian): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of\r\nOman, His Excellency Mr. Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin\r\nAbdulla.\r\nMr. Abdulla (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): Mr.\r\nPresident, it gives me great pleasure at the outset to offer\r\nyou my warmest congratulations on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. Your election to this high post reflects the value\r\nthe international community attaches to the role played by\r\nyour friendly country. We are confident of the friendly\r\nrelations between our two countries. We also know that\r\nyour expertise and commitment to international issues will\r\nenrich the discussions of this session of the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation pledges its full cooperation and\r\nsupport to you to make your presidency a success.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express my warmest\r\nthanks and appreciation to our colleague Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, for his\r\ngreat efforts as President at the previous session. I would\r\nalso like to salute Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\ngreat efforts in enhancing the administration and\r\nperformance of the United Nations and its mission to\r\nserve international peace and security.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman welcomes the admission at\r\nthis session of the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to the membership of\r\nthe United Nations. We are confident that their\r\nmembership will reflect positively on the United Nations\r\nand will help us further consolidate our efforts as an\r\ninternational community to achieve the progress and\r\nprosperity we all aspire to, in a way that promotes the\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nnoble goals for which this important international forum\r\nwas created.\r\nThe unanimous decision to hold the millennium\r\nsummit during the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly is clear proof of the importance of that last\r\nsummit of this century. This is an essential and important\r\nstep that will enable our leaders to issue a declaration that\r\nmay be considered a plan of action. That declaration could\r\nreformulate a new concept for economic success and\r\ndevelopment for all peoples.\r\nAs we approach the next century with confidence, we\r\nmust focus our attention on restructuring the work of\r\ninternational organizations in order to enrich and develop\r\nthe work of the United Nations and its relevant agencies,\r\nsuch as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund\r\nand other international and regional institutions, so that they\r\nare able to function effectively for the future welfare and\r\nprosperity of humanity.\r\nWe recognize the importance of the effective\r\nmanagement of these international institutions through the\r\ngenerous and special financial and technical contributions\r\nof developed nations and institutions. These contributions\r\nmust always meet the needs and priorities of reforming the\r\neconomies of developing nations, which form the largest\r\npart of the global market and which provide a large part of\r\nthe world\u0027s natural resources and raw materials. The\r\ndevelopment of these economies will undoubtedly bring\r\nabout a more stable world economy.\r\nWe call for the establishment of balanced rules and\r\nregulations between the developed nations of the North and\r\nthe developing nations of the South in order to effect a\r\nqualitative change in their relations. While bold change and\r\nreal sacrifices are needed to restructure the economies of\r\nthe developing world so that they can meet the\r\nrequirements of the global free market, there is a greater\r\nneed for the economically developed nations to take bold\r\nand decisive steps in cancelling more debts, restructuring\r\nthe costs of manufactured goods and establishing a new\r\neconomic mechanism to provide loans and to re-regulate\r\nthe size of industries and lower global rates of inflation. We\r\nalso call for the establishment of an international reporting\r\nsystem that will draw up periodic regional plans to enable\r\nall regions to achieve the economic advances necessary to\r\novercome their economic difficulties.\r\nWe look with admiration and great interest to the\r\nEuropean Union\u0027s experience of economic integration as a\r\npilot project that aims at serving the economic prosperity of\r\nthe peoples of the European continent, the integration of\r\ntheir cultural heritage and the elimination of their social\r\nand political differences. Indeed, such a qualitative leap\r\nin European society would undoubtedly contribute to a\r\nmore stable and balanced world, especially if it were\r\nbased on moral norms of international transparency. It\r\nwould surely be an excellent model which could be\r\nemulated in other parts of the world in keeping with the\r\nspecific requirements of these regions and in a way that\r\nresponds to their traditions, their heritage and the\r\nparticularities of their culture. We believe that economic\r\ndevelopment and trade are a bridge for communication\r\nbetween civilizations.\r\nTherefore, negotiations leading to the admission of\r\nthe rest of the developing countries to the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) must be fair and just. Such\r\nnegotiations must recognize the importance of giving\r\ndeveloping nations an opportunity to see their trade and\r\ntheir infant industries grow and an opportunity also to\r\nconsolidate their competitive edge, in the context of a\r\ngeneral commitment to the free market principles of\r\nsupply and demand.\r\nOur world needs to rid the large markets of the\r\ndeveloped nations of dumping policies, market constraints\r\nand other obstacles to free trade: free trade should not be\r\na way to destroy the economies of the developing\r\ncountries. A realistic balance between the interests of the\r\ndeveloped and the developing nations should be the aim\r\nof the forthcoming WTO Ministerial-level conference in\r\nSeattle. Such a balance should draw on the world\u0027s\r\nexperience since the end of the cold war and the\r\nemergence of the new world order.\r\nIn the present international climate, the United\r\nNations bears the huge responsibility of creating the right\r\nsocial and economic circumstances for better, more\r\nharmonious coexistence and for peace and stability. That\r\nresponsibility creates an urgent need for more consultation\r\nand dialogue between Member States, especially at the\r\nregional level, towards restructuring United Nations\r\nbodies and expanding the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe must encourage serious, realistic and flexible\r\nthinking about the Council\u0027s role, responsibilities and\r\nmandates in the service of international peace and security\r\nto enable the Council to be more receptive and\r\nrealistically responsive to cultural and educational\r\npluralism and to the various political schools of thought\r\nin human society. Expanded membership would also\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nenhance the role of the new forces that are currently\r\nbecoming more important through their influence on\r\ninternational events.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, we have heard the calls\r\nfor democracy, free trade and the free market economy as\r\nways of establishing greater harmony among humankind.\r\nWe believe that the road towards this objective must begin\r\nwith dialogue between civilizations on an international\r\nplatform of cultural norms, and based on the sound\r\nprinciples of balanced political relations, interests and\r\nmutual benefit in keeping with the needs of every culture\r\nand civilization. The new ideas emanating from this\r\ndialogue could be used as a new moral gateway to relations\r\nbetween people in the new millennium and as a bond of\r\ntrust and fruitful cooperation between all cultures and\r\ncivilizations. It would certainly create a new and common\r\nharmony in all patterns of life.\r\nWe support this human endeavour in the context of\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 53/22 proclaiming the year\r\n2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. We support any regional or multilateral action\r\nthat seeks to solve the political disputes still outstanding\r\nbetween States, especially between neighbouring States,\r\nwhich share common interests along with a common\r\nborder.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman believes deeply in the\r\nimportance of quiet and meaningful dialogue between all\r\nStates and between all parties. Oman works alongside its\r\nbrothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council to consolidate a\r\npositive climate and extend our common ground with\r\nneighbouring countries. We do so in order to ensure that\r\ncommon principles and rules are adopted and accepted to\r\nform the basis for bilateral or collective dialogue on\r\noutstanding problems.\r\nIraq is still subject to the sanctions regime imposed by\r\nthe Security Council in the aftermath of Iraq\u0027s invasion of\r\nKuwait in August 1990. Although the Security Council,\r\nthrough the United Nations Special Commission\r\n(UNSCOM), has tried to enforce its resolutions on the\r\ndestruction of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction over the\r\nlast eight years, it has not yet been able to agree on a\r\nunanimous policy towards Iraq. Consequently, the Iraqi\r\npeople are suffering greatly from the continuing sanctions.\r\nAlthough the oil—for—food programme has been\r\nimplemented, it cannot satisfactorily meet the basic\r\nhumanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. In this context,\r\nmany international organizations and agencies working in\r\nthe field of health and other humanitarian services have\r\nexpressed their fears about the dire effects that threaten\r\nthe future of the Iraqi people.\r\nThe Council of the League of Arab States, in its\r\nconsultative session of 24 January 1999, adopted a call\r\nfor the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq to be lifted.\r\nThe Council appealed to all Arab Governments to make\r\nevery possible effort towards this end through cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman emphasizes the importance\r\nof lifting the economic sanctions in order to end the\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people. We call on the Security\r\nCouncil to put its differences aside and adopt a positive\r\nand unanimous policy towards Iraq. We also call on the\r\nIraqi Government to cooperate positively and fully with\r\nthe United Nations in implementing the remaining\r\nresolutions, especially those relating to Kuwaiti prisoners\r\nof war and missing persons.\r\nThe early signs of the long-awaited peace in the\r\nMiddle East, to which its people have long aspired,\r\nfortunately coincide with the end of the century and the\r\nbeginning of the third millennium. All parties, especially\r\nthe Israeli Government, must take this opportunity to\r\nwrite a new history based on coexistence and cooperation\r\namong the peoples of the region, a region that so urgently\r\nneeds to enjoy the fruits of stability and development.\r\nThe establishment of an independent Palestinian\r\nState will undoubtedly be an important pillar for the\r\nconclusion of a comprehensive and just peace in the\r\nMiddle East. It will also serve as a real tool for the\r\ndevelopment of cooperation and coexistence between the\r\nArab States and Israel.\r\nWe call on the Israeli Government to respond\r\nquickly and implement the various obligations and\r\nagreements concluded since Madrid. We also call upon\r\nthe Israeli Government to implement Security Council\r\nresolutions on Lebanon: resolutions 425 (1978) and 426\r\n(1978). We call upon Israel to resume negotiations on the\r\nSyrian track at the point where they left off and to make\r\nevery effort to withdraw from occupied Syrian territory to\r\nthe established border of 4 June 1967.\r\nMutual security requirements between the Arabs and\r\nIsraelis on both sides of the border are of prime\r\nimportance. The legitimacy of such requirements justifies\r\nnegotiations on the basis of the principle of land for\r\npeace. Israel must feel secure and comfortable about the\r\ngeneral Arab attitude towards peace.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nPeace agreements signed with Egypt and Jordan have\r\noffered the clearest proof of the Arabs\u0027 commitment to\r\npeace and their absolute willingness to participate, along\r\nwith Israel, in the establishment of a secure, peaceful and\r\ndeveloped Middle East. Arab positions across a range of\r\ninternational activities and forums have demonstrated the\r\nseriousness of their desire to live in peace and security with\r\nIsrael.\r\nWe are about to enter a new century. We feel hopeful\r\nand ambitious for a future in which the security and\r\nstability of human life will improve. However, a number of\r\nconflicts and hotbeds of tension continue to cause concern\r\nfor the international community.\r\nIn Africa, conflicts and confrontations among countries\r\nremain the biggest source of suffering for the African\r\npeople. Therefore, the United Nations is required to exert\r\ngreater efforts in support of the Organization of African\r\nUnity in its endeavour to mediate in the various conflicts,\r\nincluding those between Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the Great\r\nLakes region, in West Africa and in Somalia. We hope that\r\nAfrica will thus be able to free itself from the vestiges of\r\nthe past and enter a new era of freedom, economic\r\ndevelopment and security for its people and for the world\r\nat large.\r\nThe giant continent, Asia, continues to offer the most\r\ndynamic current force for human development. Despite the\r\nsuccesses achieved by the Asian people in various spheres\r\nof life, unrest, civil wars and sources of instability are still\r\nabundant.\r\nThe Muslim Asian country of Afghanistan still suffers\r\nfrom deep and complex internal conflicts. Therefore we\r\nsincerely hope that all the Afghan leaders will take\r\nadvantage of past lessons and use the world community\u0027s\r\ndesire to help them to end their crisis and to give the\r\nAfghan people the opportunity to heal their painful wounds.\r\nIn East Asia, we call on all parties in the Korean\r\npeninsula to work towards ending the conflict and the\r\nachievement of peace. Then the Korean people in North\r\nand South Korea can express their desire for a secure and\r\npeaceful future.\r\nWe have a deep sense of pain for the human tragedy\r\nin the Balkans. Reckless policies led to instability, a huge\r\nwaste of resources, the flight of defenceless people and loss\r\nof life and destruction of property. We are thankful for the\r\ntimely intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization in Kosovo, especially after the failure to carry\r\nout the Rambouillet Agreement, to put an end to the pain\r\nand suffering of the provinces\u0027 inhabitants.\r\nAs we praise the human role assumed by the world\r\ncommunity in helping the displaced and the refugees in\r\nthe Balkans, we hope that those great efforts will continue\r\nand thus conclude this noble task. We also appreciate the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General to restore peace and\r\nstability to the region.\r\nThe world still faces the nuclear threat as a result of\r\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons technology and the\r\nefforts of many States outside what is known as the\r\nnuclear club to acquire the technology for this dreadful\r\nweapon. The States seeking these weapons still feel\r\nthreatened politically and militarily and are worried about\r\ntheir security, sovereignty and future capabilities.\r\nMaking a realistic and careful assessment of this\r\nsituation would definitely lead us to conclude that there\r\nmust have been fundamental and legitimate reasons why\r\nsuch countries would choose to spend large amounts of\r\nmoney to secure such weapons at a time when these\r\nassets could have been spent on the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of their people. Among the principal and\r\nlegitimate reasons for this choice is that the major States\r\nwhich already possess nuclear weapons and technology\r\ndid not do enough to guarantee the non-proliferation of\r\nthis technology.\r\nThe phenomenon that the major Powers alone can\r\nshape choices about peace and war in areas of the\r\ndeveloping world may be one of the strongest reasons for\r\nthe sudden eruption of conflagrations in such areas.\r\nTherefore nuclear States, especially the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, should undertake the\r\nnecessary measures that will guarantee the security of\r\nnon-nuclear States and deter the use or threat of use of\r\nnuclear weapons. The United Nations, through the\r\nSecurity Council, must adopt binding resolutions in\r\naccordance with the Charter to protect the world from the\r\nthreat of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. The arms control conference which is still\r\ndebating secondary issues of technical dimensions must\r\ntherefore seek to reach positive conclusions as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nAt the last session we expressed our concern over\r\nwhat had befallen the economies of the Asian countries.\r\nWe also expressed our faith in the ability of these\r\ncountries to overcome the economic crisis and the crash\r\nthat hit the financial markets.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nToday we witness an encouraging recovery in the\r\nAsian economies — a result of the determination of these\r\ncountries, especially the States of the Association of South-\r\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to protect their economies\r\nthrough exemplary solidarity.\r\nWe would like to applaud the important role played by\r\nthose States which provided financial assistance. We pay\r\ntribute to the role played by the world financial institutions,\r\nespecially the World Bank and the International Monetary\r\nFund. They halted the danger of deterioration in the world\r\neconomy and restored confidence in Asian markets.\r\nHowever, these two institutions should review their\r\nconditions for providing loans to developing nations to help\r\ntheir economies. In most cases, these conditions fail to\r\nachieve their planned and targeted goals primarily because\r\nof the enormous social and political problems which they\r\ncreate.\r\nThe Earth Summit for the environment and\r\ndevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992, set an\r\nagenda for the twenty-first century that is now viewed as\r\nthe basis upon which international partnership and\r\ncollective responsibility can work to put an end to poverty,\r\nhunger, ill health and the deterioration of ecosystems, and\r\nto achieve sustainable development the only way for\r\nhumanity to ensure progress and prosperity for present and\r\nfuture generations.\r\nMy country takes a comprehensive view of\r\nenvironmental issues. We believe that the protection of the\r\nenvironment is a responsibility for everyone to share. In\r\nthis context, my country devotes a great segment of its\r\nresources to continuing to implement the Rio agenda and\r\neffective and objective participation in environmental and\r\ndevelopment forums on many international, regional and\r\nnational levels. We also continue to enact and update\r\nenvironmental laws in order to assure adaptation to the best\r\nstandards of environmental protection against the dangers\r\nof pollution and to guarantee the implementation of the\r\ninternational and regional environmental agreements that\r\nmy country has signed.\r\nMy country looks forward to joining the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) soon. We hope to participate in the\r\nwork of the Organization as a fully fledged member and to\r\nplay our role effectively. We thank all our trade partners\r\nwhich have expressed encouragement and understanding for\r\nour application for membership. We are determined to work\r\nhand—in—hand with all members to consolidate the\r\nmultilateral trade system and help it flourish.\r\nNext November the American city of Seattle will\r\nhost the third ministerial conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization. The Sultanate of Oman attaches special\r\nimportance to this conference because it will be a prelude\r\nto the new phase of multilateral trade negotiations, the\r\nMillennium Round, which should contribute to opening\r\nthe way for free and prosperous global trade.\r\nProbably one of the most important issues facing\r\ndeveloping countries is the issue of the liberalization of\r\nthe service sector. Although its liberalization may have\r\nsome benefits for developing countries in terms of the\r\nflow of foreign capital, technology and modern\r\nadministrative and technical expertise, it will inevitably be\r\naccompanied by huge challenges. This is particularly true\r\nin the light of open competition from the service sector in\r\ndeveloped nations. Oman expects the world community to\r\ntake measures that would help developing nations develop\r\ntheir service sectors in order to guarantee them a\r\ncomparable and viable share in the global services\r\nmarket.\r\nWe appreciate the admirable international efforts and\r\ngood intentions to establish an original global legislative\r\nstructure as a basis for international relations in different\r\nareas. However, we always return to the clear truth that\r\nin the Charter of the United Nations are enshrined the\r\npurposes and principles that we must all work to preserve\r\nin the interest of the future security and wellbeing of all\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Mr. János\r\nMartonyi.\r\nMr. Martonyi (Hungary) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme first to congratulate the President most sincerely on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the fifty—fourth session\r\nof the General Assembly. I take this opportunity to assure\r\nhim of the full support of the Hungarian delegation in the\r\nexercise of his responsibilities as the head of our\r\nAssembly.\r\nHumanity has reached the threshold of the\r\ntwenty—first century. Therefore, no Member State can\r\nremain indifferent to the way in which we discharge our\r\ntasks at this session, held as the twentieth century ends.\r\nOne of the most urgent tasks of States and\r\ninternational organizations at the turn of the century is to\r\nend the ever—growing disparities between the various\r\nregions of the world. In this regard, special attention\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nshould be paid to the African continent, which is fraught\r\nwith various crises and conflicts.\r\nThe persistence of poverty, still one of our major\r\nchallenges, is exacerbated by the process of globalization.\r\nInequality is a major source of the emergence and\r\nproliferation of all kinds of extremism and of intolerance,\r\nwith its concomitant violence, which threaten the very\r\nfoundations of contemporary civilization.\r\nAt the dawn of this new century, we are called upon\r\nto exploit further the advantages of globalization, a salient\r\nfeature of our era, while being aware of the attendant risks.\r\nAll of us in the international community must become\r\naware of the paramount importance of dealing adequately\r\nwith global problems, such as the growing gap between the\r\nlevels of economic development; environmental\r\ndegradation; the dangers posed by organized crime;\r\nuncontrolled migration; disease and so on.\r\nIn this context, we must take note of the relationship\r\nbetween globalization and regional integration. Integration\r\ncan adjust itself to the process of globalization, draw the\r\nlessons of the process\u0027s inevitable consequences, absorb its\r\nrelated risks and assist the struggle against transboundary\r\nscourges, thereby becoming the engine of the universal\r\nsystem of economic cooperation.\r\nMost conflicts today are not between States, but within\r\nStates, essentially as major ethnic or religious\r\nconfrontations that too often lead to humanitarian crises of\r\nunprecedented dimensions. Entire ethnic groups and\r\ncommunities and national and linguistic minorities are\r\nfalling victim to “ethnic cleansing”. Dictatorial regimes do\r\nnot hesitate to resort to nationalist extremism and\r\nxenophobia, and to unspeakable violence, exterminating\r\nhundreds of thousands of people, terrorizing others in their\r\nancestral lands and expelling millions of people from their\r\nhomes. We cannot remain indifferent to such acts.\r\nA great debate is therefore going on in the\r\ninternational arena, as demonstrated in this very Hall, about\r\nhow the world should react to tragic situations involving\r\nmassive and flagrant violations of human rights at a time\r\nwhen, for all kinds of reasons, our world Organization finds\r\nitself paralysed. We are convinced that, given the terrible\r\nupheavals we are witnessing throughout the world, the\r\ninternational community cannot fail to respond effectively\r\nto this major present-day challenge.\r\nThe traditional concept of the principle of national\r\nsovereignty is undergoing a progressive evolution in inter-\r\nState relations and within multilateral organizations.\r\nBecause of developments in the area of international law,\r\nnational sovereignty is becoming less acceptable as a\r\njustification for Governments in cases of serious\r\nviolations within their countries of universally recognized\r\ninternational legal standards. As the Secretary-General\r\nrightly said, in our era of globalization the collective\r\ninterest represents national interests. Fortunately, today\r\nthe principles of good governance are prevailing and\r\nflourishing in an ever-growing number of countries.\r\nIn the immediate vicinity of my country, a regime\r\nbased on extreme nationalism has sparked four wars in\r\nthe last decade. The international community, albeit after\r\nhesitation and delay, took the necessary measures. In the\r\ncase of Kosovo, it did so with great resolve and\r\nconsistency. In the wake of the action undertaken to\r\ndefend universally recognized values, and thanks to the\r\npresence of international military forces and the United\r\nNations mission, a fragile peace reigns today in that\r\nmartyred region, and considerable, increasingly effective\r\nefforts are being deployed there with a view to establish\r\npeace and stability.\r\nIn the light of the events of the past decade in this\r\npart of Europe, let us state clearly and unambiguously\r\nthat it would be pointless to expect democratization in the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia if things remain\r\nunchanged in Belgrade. However, a new Serbia, emerging\r\nfrom tragedy and destruction, free of the burdens of the\r\npast, would no doubt be able to rely on the understanding\r\nand effective assistance of the international community.\r\nIn this context, we would underscore the importance of\r\nthe implementation of the judgments of the International\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The Stability Pact,\r\ndevised with a view to responding to the needs of the\r\ncountries of South-Eastern Europe, will play a primary\r\nrole in the rehabilitation and development of the region.\r\nIt will also contribute to promoting respect for democratic\r\nstandards and human rights by proposing, inter alia,\r\ninstitutional arrangements aimed at improving relations\r\nbetween majority and minority communities within the\r\nregion.\r\nThe international community is again being put to\r\nthe test in the case of East Timor. Hungary shares the\r\nprofound concerns of all nations in the wake of recent\r\nevents, which represent a brutal violation of the right of\r\nthe people of that country to self-determination. The\r\natrocities committed against the civilian population of\r\nEast Timor represent a serious blow to human rights.\r\nThose responsible for these acts will be brought to justice.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nWe welcome the decision of the Security Council\r\nauthorizing the deployment to East Timor of a multinational\r\nforce to restore peace and security on the island as well as\r\nthe enactment of all necessary measures for the\r\nimplementation of that force\u0027s mandate.\r\nThe tragic events in Kosovo and East Timor only\r\nconfirm the universality of human rights and the importance\r\nof a timely resolution of conflict by appropriate means.\r\nThey also demonstrate the value of harmonious cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations, regional organizations and\r\nparticular groups of States, a cooperation that is becoming\r\nincreasingly important in dealing with the diverse and\r\nvaried conflicts that are erupting — and, unfortunately, will\r\ncontinue to erupt — throughout the world. Hungary is\r\nprepared, with its own means, to take part in this great\r\nenterprise of safeguarding and restoring international peace\r\nand security.\r\nAmong the phenomena that threaten peace and\r\nsecurity throughout the world, the question of the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction will require\r\nsustained attention in future. Regional conflicts having\r\nnuclear ramifications only aggravate the destabilizing effect\r\nof certain crisis areas.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the pillars of the global non-\r\nproliferation system — such as the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, whose Review\r\nConference will be one of the major events on next year\u0027s\r\ndiplomatic calendar, or the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) — take on additional significance. We\r\nregret that the CTBT has not yet been able to exert its\r\nfavourable influence on the process of nuclear disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation. We would like here to underscore the\r\nresponsibility of the 44 States whose ratification is needed\r\nfor this key instrument to enter into force. My country, as\r\none of the States in question, has already ratified the Treaty\r\nand thereby discharged its obligations. The international\r\nconference to be convened next October in Vienna is likely\r\nto play an important role in speeding up the process leading\r\nto the entry into force of this instrument. We would be\r\ngratified if those States that have not yet acceded to the\r\nTreaty participated in that conference and decided, in the\r\nnear future, to sign and ratify the Treaty.\r\nWe would underscore also the need to commence, as\r\nsoon as possible, negotiations on a fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty. The entry into force of the Ottawa Convention on\r\nanti-personnel mines could contribute tangibly to resolving\r\nthe humanitarian, economic and social problems stemming\r\nfrom the massive and irresponsible use of these mines. In\r\nthat connection, we note with satisfaction the outcome of\r\nthe Maputo meeting. Hungary was one of the first\r\ncountries to join the Ottawa process and recently\r\ncompleted the destruction of its stocks of anti-personnel\r\nmines. We hope that other countries in the region will\r\nfollow our example, as this could contribute to the\r\nelimination of all of these lethal devices in the crisis area\r\nalong our southern border.\r\nWe would also note the importance of speeding up\r\nnegotiations to conclude a verification protocol annexed\r\nto the Biological Weapons Convention. We believe that\r\nthese negotiations could be completed sometime between\r\nnow and next summer. As Chairman of the ad hoc Group\r\nmandated to draft a verification protocol, Hungary is\r\nprepared to contribute to any political initiative that could\r\npromote its implementation.\r\nI cannot fail to mention the establishment of an\r\nInternational Criminal Court — a deeply significant\r\nundertaking. In our view, the Court is an indispensable\r\ninstitution if we are to take action against crimes against\r\nhumanity and war crimes. The Court will not only bring\r\nto justice people who have been accused of serious\r\ncrimes, but will also act as a deterrent, thereby\r\ncontributing to the maintenance of regional and\r\ninternational peace and security. We hope that the number\r\nof signatures and ratifications of the Rome Statute will\r\ncontinue to grow and that disputed questions relating to\r\nthe universal acceptance of the Court will be resolved as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nActs of terrorism in recent weeks sadly remind us of\r\nthe great challenge involved in combating this\r\nphenomenon. They underscore the importance of making\r\nnew efforts and the imperative need for concerted\r\ninternational action in this area. We hope that at this\r\nsession of the General Assembly we will be able to go\r\nbeyond the universal introduction and complete\r\nimplementation of international agreements relating to\r\nterrorism that are already in force, and move forward the\r\nwork of finalizing international agreements relating to\r\nnuclear terrorism and the prevention of financing for\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe authority and prestige of the United Nations\r\ndepend to a large extent on the capacity of its Member\r\nStates to reform the Organization. In the light of the\r\nexperience of recent years, it is very clear that reform is\r\na long-term process and will be probably consist of\r\nvarious interconnected stages. The achievements thus far,\r\nthough insufficient in themselves, are valuable elements\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nthat must be built upon if we are to go further along this\r\nlong road leading to the transformation and revitalization of\r\nthe world Organization, including the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. What is certain is that if we are to succeed, all\r\nMember States, without exception, will have to get to work\r\nwith a greater sense of commitment. We expect the\r\nmillennium summit, to be held next year, to give the\r\nnecessary impetus to the dynamic continuation of United\r\nNations reform.\r\nAs has been repeated on many occasions, our\r\nparamount task today is to make this unique Organization,\r\nthe United Nations, capable of preserving the values of our\r\ncivilization in a twenty-first century that promises to be\r\nturbulent. At the dawn of the year 2000, which also marks\r\nthe thousandth anniversary of the foundation of our State,\r\nit is up to all of us — Governments, the business world and\r\ncivil society — to make our planet a decent and habitable\r\nplace for future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade of Iceland,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Halldór Ásgrímsson.\r\nMr. Ásgrímsson (Iceland): Allow me at the outset to\r\ncongratulate the President heartily on his election. His post\r\nis a challenging one, and I am particularly pleased that this\r\nsession is being chaired by a colleague from Namibia,\r\nwhich is an important partner for my country.\r\nThe crucial role of the United Nations in the global\r\ncommunity can never be overstated. As this millennium\r\ndraws to a close, it is natural to take stock of the past and\r\ntry to foresee what the future holds in store. The\r\nOrganization\u0027s reform measures have included an inward\r\nlook at the organizational structure and personnel matters\r\nand, last but not least, its financial make-up. In this respect,\r\nmany feel that more needs to be done. We must have the\r\ncourage to scrutinize not only the Organization itself, but\r\nalso the manner in which the Member States conduct their\r\nbusiness inside these walls. While we are going through\r\nthis process, the utmost care should be taken to prevent the\r\ndiscussion from negatively affecting the public image of the\r\nOrganization. Moreover, we should make sure that it does\r\nnot have detrimental effects on the morale of the United\r\nNations international staff, whom we depend upon for the\r\nsmooth operation of the difficult and often dangerous tasks\r\nwe assign to them. A constructive approach to reform is\r\nvital for the future of the United Nations.\r\nThere is a real need to strengthen the ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to tackle the complex challenges of the\r\nmodern world. A case in point is the Working Group on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council, which has deliberated\r\nfor years without tangible results, with no end in sight.\r\nThis constant repetition can serve only to weaken the\r\nUnited Nations, which has proved itself on many\r\noccasions to be of fundamental importance to mankind.\r\nBut it is not only the organizational structures that\r\nneed to be adapted. We need also to look at the\r\nsubstance. In this regard, I welcome the emphasis placed\r\nby the Secretary-General in his recent report on creating\r\na culture of prevention. As he correctly points out, our\r\npolitical and organizational cultures and practices remain\r\noriented far more towards reaction than prevention. This\r\nneeds to be changed; the efficiency of the United Nations\r\nmight thereby be greatly enhanced.\r\nDuring a recent meeting of the Foreign Ministers of\r\nthe five Nordic countries held in Iceland, we issued a\r\njoint declaration against the use of child soldiers. In the\r\ndeclaration it is noted that the current protection of\r\nchildren in armed conflicts is insufficient and that\r\ninternational standards must be raised. On the occasion of\r\nthe tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child this year, the Nordic Ministers support the\r\nurgent finalization of an optional protocol to ensure that\r\npersons below the age of 18 years are not recruited into\r\narmed forces or into armed groups distinct from\r\ngovernmental forces. Children should not be forced to\r\ntake part in hostilities under any circumstances.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to express my\r\nsatisfaction with the work carried out by the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children and\r\nArmed Conflict, especially for his efforts to make non-\r\ngovernmental forces around the world refrain from using\r\nchild soldiers.\r\nThe vast majority of United Nations Member States\r\nhave ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nWe have committed ourselves to certain actions to\r\npromote children\u0027s rights. Causing children to take part in\r\narmed conflicts or otherwise putting them at risk of\r\nbecoming victims of such hostilities is clearly against the\r\nbest interests of the child, which should always be our\r\nprimary consideration. There is another powerful reason\r\nto protect children: they are our future. Protecting today\u0027s\r\nchildren is in itself an important contribution towards\r\npeace and towards creating a culture of prevention. We\r\nshould also strive to ensure that children are able to enjoy\r\ntheir rights during transitional periods following armed\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nconflicts or other emergency situations until enough\r\nstability has been achieved to start reconstruction.\r\nIt seems that not a week goes by in our world without\r\ncountries and indeed the international community having to\r\nwatch in horror as cowardly terrorists target people going\r\nabout the business of their everyday lives. The murdering\r\nof innocents will never further any cause or put an end to\r\nany conflict; it will only add names to the roster of the\r\ndead. We urge States to sign and ratify counter-terrorism\r\nconventions.\r\nIn this connection, I would further like to reiterate our\r\nresolve in combatting transnational crime and the\r\ninternational trade in drugs. No country is immune from\r\nthese modern evils. Given their global scope and the\r\nresources available to criminals, Governments the world\r\nover must work together to put an end to these activities.\r\nThis year we have recognized the importance of the\r\nelderly and their contributions to our lives and society by\r\nobserving 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nThe Icelandic authorities have done their utmost to enhance\r\nthe visibility of issues facing the elderly in today\u0027s society.\r\nThis has been done through a number of projects, including\r\nprojects designed to bridge the generation gap by\r\nencouraging interaction between age groups.\r\nAt a time of unparalleled economic growth spurred on\r\nby the globalization of the world\u0027s economy, the fruits of\r\nthis growth, unfortunately, are not evenly distributed. We\r\nare witnessing a growing gap in the distribution of wealth\r\nwithin societies as well as between the North and the\r\nSouth. Moreover, we have been witnessing an appalling\r\ntrend whereby the curse of poverty has increasingly been\r\nfalling upon the shoulders of women. There are no easy\r\nanswers on how to tackle this problem in the short term,\r\nbut two long-term approaches stand out regarding the\r\nempowerment and advancement of women. They are\r\neducation and respect for human rights.\r\nAn educated woman passes knowledge to her children,\r\nwhich is not as often the case with men. It is universally\r\naccepted that education and social development go hand in\r\nhand and are conditions for a peaceful and prosperous\r\nworld. In this age of globalization and technology, it\r\nbecomes ever more important to ensure universal education.\r\nTherefore, it is crucial to incorporate education into\r\ndevelopment projects. For the past few years we have been\r\ndoing that through training in the fisheries sector as well as\r\nby conducting adult literacy programmes for women in\r\ncountries such as Namibia. Similar programmes are being\r\nprepared for Malawi and Mozambique.\r\nVigorous efforts also have to be made to end other\r\nforms of discrimination against women. This applies not\r\nonly at the national level but also at the international\r\nlevel, where the actions of international organizations are\r\nincreasingly having a direct impact on peoples\u0027 lives, for\r\nexample through crisis management. When carrying out\r\nsuch tasks, it is the duty of the organizations concerned\r\nto ensure that women and their interests are represented\r\nat the negotiating table.\r\nDuring the high-level segment of this year\u0027s session\r\nof the Economic and Social Council, the Icelandic\r\ndelegation paid special attention to the plight of the urban\r\npoor who inhabit coastal regions around the world.\r\nToday, my country, Iceland, has a thriving economy\r\nbased on our fishing industry. The development of a\r\nviable fishing industry has strengthened the economy by\r\ncreating employment opportunities and prosperity, which\r\nin turn have benefitted the population at large. It is self-\r\nevident that a developed fisheries sector can be a crucial\r\nfactor in enhancing the food security of developing\r\ncountries. The Icelandic authorities have urged private\r\ncompanies to invest in the fisheries sectors of many\r\ndeveloping countries. Partnerships forged in this manner\r\nbetween firms in my country and a number of developing\r\ncountries have led to transfer of technology in this field,\r\nthereby spurring economic growth and development in the\r\ncoastal regions in question.\r\nWe believe that many developing countries can\r\nbenefit much more from rational utilization of the\r\nresources of the oceans. Therefore, approximately half of\r\nour development cooperation has been concentrated on\r\nresearch and training in the fisheries sector, putting an\r\nemphasis on the sustainable utilization of natural\r\nresources.\r\nThrough the years, Iceland has placed particular\r\nimportance on the work of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development. During its seventh session,\r\nearlier this year, the Icelandic Government noted the\r\nnecessity of abolishing State subsidies that contribute to\r\novercapacity in the fisheries sector worldwide, and\r\nparticipated actively in discussions on the need for\r\nimproved coordination within the United Nations system\r\nin the field of ocean affairs. It is our view that the overall\r\ndebate on the oceans can be improved. It is, however, our\r\nfirm belief that efforts to improve the handling of ocean\r\nissues should draw upon existing institutional resources.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nThese efforts should also carefully take into account the\r\nprinciple that global bodies should not try to solve local or\r\nregional problems of fisheries management. The\r\nmanagement of living marine resources is a very complex\r\nand sensitive task that has to be dealt with using the most\r\nadvanced scientific knowledge available and in harmony\r\nwith local socio-economic and environmental\r\ncircumstances.\r\nConflicts where the civilian population is expressly\r\ntargeted are abhorrent and leave scars that take generations\r\nto heal. Once again, we have witnessed the emergence of\r\nthe dark and evil side of human nature in the horrible\r\nethnic cleansing that took place in the recent conflict in\r\nKosovo. It would have been desirable if the United Nations\r\ncould have played an all-encompassing role in the\r\nsettlement of that conflict.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to endorse the position put\r\nforward on humanitarian intervention by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. When a State not only stops protecting the rights\r\nof its citizens but turns against them through gross\r\nviolations of human rights, the international community\r\ncannot and should not stand idly by.\r\nIceland currently holds the chair of the Council of\r\nEurope, which encompasses 41 European countries. I would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to stress the value and\r\nimportance of close cooperation between the Council and\r\nthe United Nations in the field of human rights. We have\r\nrecent examples of such practical cooperation in Kosovo,\r\nwhere the Council of Europe is working together with the\r\nUnited Nations and other organizations in fulfilment of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the European\r\nUnion-led Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe.\r\nReferring again to the benefits of prevention, I should say\r\nthat prevention is at the very centre of the Council of\r\nEurope\u0027s work on human rights, democracy and the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\nThe agreement between Portugal and Indonesia on the\r\nfuture of East Timor was historic, as was the referendum\r\nwhich took place. The appalling violence that followed is\r\na cause of great concern. Every effort has to be made to\r\nhalt it and to punish those responsible. My Government\r\nfully supports Security Council resolution 1264 (1999) and\r\nwelcomes the speedy deployment of the multinational force.\r\nNothing should be allowed to delay the process towards the\r\nindependence of East Timor.\r\nWe welcome also the change of pace in the Middle\r\nEast peace process. The positive developments in the last\r\nfew months between the Israelis and the Palestinians have\r\nbeen very encouraging, and we sincerely hope that this\r\nrenewed momentum will carry us towards a lasting peace\r\nin the region. We urge other countries in the region to\r\nseize this particular moment and to start the healing of\r\nwounds that have been festering for so long.\r\nIcelanders are no strangers to natural disasters, and\r\nwe know the devastation they can unleash upon countries\r\nand peoples. Our hearts and sympathy go out to our\r\nfriends in Turkey, Greece and now, most recently, on the\r\nisland of Taiwan, who face the aftermath of earthquakes\r\nthat claimed the lives of a great number of people. We\r\nhave now decided to join the United Nations Disaster\r\nAssessment and Coordination Stand-by Team because we\r\nbelieve we can make a contribution.\r\nDuring this century we have witnessed mankind\u0027s\r\ngreatest achievements as well as its greatest failures.\r\nWhile many countries have gone from war to peace and\r\nfrom poverty to prosperity, others have been unable to\r\ngrasp these often elusive goals of humanity. It is clear\r\nthat we will be entering the new millennium with\r\nunsolved problems and with challenges of such a\r\nmagnitude that they will continue to confront us into an\r\nunforeseen future.\r\nI would like, in closing, to stress what I said in the\r\nbeginning — that only with a renewed and revitalized\r\nUnited Nations can we hope to deal with the threats and\r\nchallenges that lie ahead. If we, the Member States,\r\nshoulder our responsibilities and implement the changes\r\nnecessary, then the United Nations will always be at the\r\nforefront of the quest for peace and prosperity. If we do\r\nnot have the courage to adopt the necessary changes, we\r\ncannot expect our children to do so.\r\nThe Acting President: I next give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Liechtenstein, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Andrea Willi.\r\nMrs. Willi: This is the sixth time that I have had the\r\nhonour to address the General Assembly, and it is a great\r\npleasure for me to be back here in this body.\r\nI would, at the outset, like to congratulate Mr.\r\nGurirab warmly on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Both\r\nLiechtenstein and Namibia figure among the younger\r\nMembers of this Organization, since both our countries\r\nwere admitted to the United Nations in 1990. The\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nPresident can count on Liechtenstein\u0027s support as he guides\r\nthe Assembly to fruitful outcomes.\r\nI would also like to extend our warm welcome to the\r\nKingdom of Tonga, the Republic of Kiribati and the\r\nRepublic of Nauru.\r\nThe general debate is an important opportunity for all\r\nof us to take stock, to comment on the state of the\r\nOrganization, to voice our concerns and, if necessary,\r\ndissatisfaction and, most important, to offer constructive\r\nthoughts and ideas for the future.\r\nAt the time when Liechtenstein became a Member of\r\nthe United Nations, nine years ago, the cold war had just\r\ncome to an end, and we tried to identify the challenges and\r\nopportunities created by the new situation. The hopes and\r\nexpectations were high, the concerns and problems\r\nmanifold. It was clear to many of us that our Organization\r\nwas not fully equipped to face the upcoming challenges,\r\nand, indeed, mistakes have happened along the way.\r\nToday, we can say that the somewhat perverse order\r\nof the cold war has been replaced by the era of\r\nglobalization. Some of us welcome this new era, some of\r\nus fear it. However different our opinions, there can and\r\nshould be one common denominator: that we acknowledge\r\nthe arrival of this new era and that we join our forces to\r\nface its challenges.\r\nGlobalization has two faces: it offers a potential, from\r\nwhich — if properly explored — mankind as a whole can\r\nbenefit. It also contains risks, especially for those who are\r\nalready in a perilous position.\r\nIn order to be able to face these two enormous tasks\r\nefficiently, we have to work together, because that is the\r\nonly way for us to succeed. The United Nations is the sole\r\nforum that is of truly global range, and thus it offers the\r\nonly opportunity for us to address these issues — assuming\r\nwe are equipped with the right tools.\r\nThe past years have been characterized by important\r\nand far-reaching reform efforts. The challenges of\r\nglobalization make further measures necessary, such as the\r\nenhanced inclusion, participation and accountability of non-\r\nState actors. In a globalized world, such actors play\r\nincreasingly influential roles, both positive and negative.\r\nPersons and organizations that constitute significant\r\neconomic forces have to be involved in our considerations\r\nand decision-making processes. Actors such as terrorists\r\nand parties to internal armed conflicts have to be held\r\naccountable for their actions and for the consequences\r\nthereof.\r\nThe public at large often mistakenly equates the\r\nUnited Nations with the work of only the Security\r\nCouncil. This is factually wrong, and we should use every\r\nopportunity to inform people worldwide about the wide\r\nrange of activities carried out by our Organization and its\r\nspecialized agencies. But we also have to bear in mind\r\nthe immense importance of the work of the Council and\r\nmust have a certain appreciation of why the public\r\nfocuses only on the Council\u0027s work, erroneous as this\r\napproach may be. It is simply a fact that the credibility of\r\nthe United Nations depends to a very large extent on the\r\ncredibility of the work of the Security Council. This\r\ncredibility has suffered serious blows in the recent past,\r\nand we cannot afford to ignore the root causes of the\r\nproblem.\r\nWe have to address the existing problems and to\r\ndesign ways and means to avoid further, perhaps\r\nirreversible, damage. Strict observance of the key\r\nprovisions of the Charter is one essential element in this\r\nrespect, and reform of the Security Council is another.\r\nFor a long time we have talked about all aspects of such\r\na reform, including the composition of the Council. The\r\nmoment has come for us to recognize that the question of\r\nthe veto is at the core of every credible and sustainable\r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nMy country has long expressed concern about the\r\nsituation in Kosovo and has asked for preventive efforts\r\nin order to avoid an escalation of this situation. In\r\nsolidarity with the victims and wanting to take some\r\nresponsibility for them, Liechtenstein has given temporary\r\nshelter to a large number of Kosovar refugees, has\r\nparticipated in the provision of humanitarian assistance,\r\nin particular through the relevant United Nations agencies,\r\nand has expressed full support to the United Nations\r\nMission in Kosovo and to the ongoing efforts of\r\nreconstruction.\r\nAt the same time, we also have questions, and we\r\nnotice that others do too. How can we reconcile the role\r\ngiven to the Security Council under the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations with a “humanitarian intervention” not\r\nmandated by the Council? What does this mean for the\r\nfuture of the Security Council and of the Organization as\r\na whole? Are regional organizations to assume a leading\r\nrole that goes beyond what is contained in Chapter VIII\r\nof the Charter? It will be important to discuss these\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nquestions, though finding satisfactory answers is certainly\r\ndifficult.\r\nTo our mind, Kosovo has made it very clear once\r\nmore that the prevention of conflicts must be the key\r\nconcept in conflict-resolution as well as in other areas.\r\nPreventive measures are the best means of saving lives and\r\nresources of every kind, and they can be carried out quickly\r\nand with discretion. Prevention does not make big news\r\nheadlines, but it reduces the number of headlines on\r\ndisasters, of which we continue to see just too many. The\r\npotential of prevention is enormous, but its application so\r\nfar is too modest and far too limited.\r\nWe know that there is still reluctance and hesitation,\r\nbut we feel a sense of urgency, a pressing need to enhance\r\npreventive activities and to replace a classical concept of\r\nsovereignty — a concept that is outdated in many aspects\r\n— with a new one which enables us to tackle situations of\r\npotential and actual crisis with determination and efficiency.\r\nWe thus welcome the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe work of the Organization and his very inspiring and\r\ntimely remarks on a “culture of prevention”. We are\r\nconvinced that this is the right way for the international\r\ncommunity to go.\r\nKosovo has been and somewhat sadly remains a prime\r\nexample of the need for prevention. Liechtenstein has for\r\nseveral years now promoted ideas and suggestions on a\r\npreventive approach with regard to problems arising from\r\nthe application of the right of self-determination. The\r\ninternational community remains stuck in a situation in\r\nwhich the exercise of the right of self-determination —\r\nwhich is the prerequisite for the enjoyment of all human\r\nrights — is denied because it is misunderstood as a claim\r\nto independence and statehood. We all have known for very\r\nlong, since the adoption by the General Assembly of the\r\nFriendly Relations Declaration in 1970, that this is not\r\ncorrect. Self-determination can mean many other things, if\r\nexercised in a flexible manner and based on a dialogue\r\nbetween the parties concerned. It does not have to lead to\r\nthe break-up of States; it should rather facilitate the\r\npeaceful coexistence of States and communities which are\r\nprovided a degree of self-administration or self-governance\r\nas an expression of their right of self-determination.\r\nIt is time to free ourselves from biased and obsolete\r\nthinking and to recognize that the effective application and\r\nexercise of the right of self-determination is the basis for\r\npreventing violent disintegration of States as well as\r\ninternal armed conflicts with all their gruesome aspects and\r\nendless human suffering.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Brunei Darussalam, His\r\nRoyal Highness, Prince Mohamed Bolkiah.\r\nPrince Mohamed Bolkiah (Brunei Darussalam): I\r\nextend my congratulations to Mr. Gurirab on his election\r\nand my warmest respects to his predecessor, Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti. My very best wishes go to them both and to our\r\nfellow Members, together with my great appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Annan for all his work on behalf of the\r\nGeneral Assembly during the past year.\r\nI would like to offer a special welcome to our new\r\nMembers, the Kingdom of Tonga and the Republics of\r\nKiribati and Nauru. They join us at a time when all of us,\r\nbig and small, are feeling what we might call the “cutting\r\nedge” of certain problems. These problems cut very\r\ndeeply indeed into the lives of the people we all\r\nrepresent. They are the ones the United Nations will be\r\nincreasingly called upon to address in the coming\r\ndecades.\r\nI refer to a host of challenges facing us on the eve\r\nof the new millennium, problems touching on all aspects\r\nof human affairs: overpopulation, migration and\r\ndiminishing resources; economic and financial problems;\r\nsocial and cultural ones; far-reaching environmental ones;\r\nand even transnational criminal ones. These are what I\r\nwould describe as today\u0027s problems. I say this because\r\ntoday we are at a special time when the birth of a new\r\ncentury is bound to provide renewed hope for the people\r\nwe represent. This means that every one of us here, from\r\nthe newest Member to the great nations of the Security\r\nCouncil, has a valued contribution to make to our efforts\r\nto meet this Organization\u0027s overriding future challenge.\r\nThis challenge, I feel, amounts to a choice between\r\ntwo basic approaches. On the one hand, we can continue\r\nto devote our severely stretched finances to deal with\r\nwhat I would respectfully call yesterday\u0027s problems. I call\r\nthem that because many date back to the founding years\r\nof the Organization. They are most obvious, of course, in\r\nthe Middle East, where a just and lasting settlement for\r\nthe Palestinian people is so long overdue. Others are the\r\nlingering concerns of the century before that. A few even\r\ngo back half a dozen centuries or more.\r\nYet we are still using up many scarce human and\r\nmaterial resources sticking temporary patches over these\r\nproblems. Of course, sadly, that is always going to be\r\npart of our work. We have them in every continent, every\r\nregion and subregion, even today in our own part of the\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nworld in South-East Asia. But this should not be the prime\r\ngoal of the General Assembly or of the Security Council,\r\nfor we have an alternative.\r\nThis is to give our wholehearted support to the\r\nSecretary-General in his efforts to direct us towards the\r\nthings the United Nations is equipped to do: identifying the\r\ncauses of future division and possibly inevitable conflict;\r\ncoordinating world efforts to address them; and devising\r\neffective solutions. I hope we can resolve to choose this\r\nlatter course, as it is what the United Nations does best. It\r\nis why, if anyone should ask: “Is the world a better place\r\nfor its people than it was over 50 years ago?”, we can\r\nanswer with conviction: “Yes”. And if asked why, we can\r\nsay, equally surely: “Because this Organization exists”.\r\nThis has been well illustrated over the last few years.\r\nThe United Nations has demonstrated great compassion for\r\nthe people of the world. Together with various non-\r\ngovernmental bodies, it has resolutely sought to direct\r\nMembers\u0027 attention to the major problems we will face in\r\nthe next century.\r\nThis is preventive diplomacy at the highest level. It is\r\nwhat we are trying our best to do in our own region in\r\npolitical and security matters through the Regional Forum\r\nof the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\nand, in economic affairs, with our partners in the Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC). The\r\nSecretary-General and his staff are therefore to be\r\ncommended for their efforts to conduct it on the wider\r\ninternational stage in spite of all their financial constraints.\r\nI believe that this aspect of our work is the reason\r\nwhy the United Nations has survived and, in fact, grown in\r\nmembership. It is why our people still look up to this body\r\nin their hopes for the future. However, if we are to continue\r\nto enjoy such esteem, it is most important for the United\r\nNations to strengthen its role. The way to do this is clear.\r\nWe must press ahead with plans for reform.\r\nWith this in mind, I am very pleased that some of the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s reform measures have been successfully\r\nimplemented. Certainly, a few complex issues, such as the\r\nreform of the Security Council, remain unresolved, but I\r\nhope these matters can be completed quickly. It is a crucial\r\ntest of our ability to proceed with reform and we very\r\nmuch welcome the efforts of all who have been actively\r\nworking to achieve progress in this matter. What is called\r\nfor, as always, is enormous political will on all our parts\r\nand a determination to work together. We dearly hope that\r\nthis will be the hallmark of our millennium celebrations.\r\nToday\u0027s world, of course, tests every concept of\r\ninternational cooperation. In South-East Asia, we have\r\nfound this out the hard way. In doing so, we have learned\r\nmany lessons from the economic crisis which struck our\r\nregion two years ago. Perhaps the most important is a\r\npowerful human one. This is the need to work together as\r\nneighbours and partners, to appreciate each other\u0027s\r\nconcerns and to do what we can to help each other. In\r\nshort, we have learned about the vital need for\r\ncooperation in the hard, practical terms of today\u0027s\r\ncompetitive, globalized world.\r\nAt the same time, we have begun to recognize what\r\nwe need from this Organization and how important it is\r\nfor our people. Basically, it is to this body that we look\r\nto stimulate our awareness of what will be required if we\r\nare to meet the challenges of the new century\r\nsuccessfully. That is why we very much appreciate the\r\nprogrammes which have been set up this year and will\r\nbegin over the next five years to do just this. We offer\r\nthem our full support, whether it be on global matters, as\r\nin the recent International Conference on Population and\r\nDevelopment; on special concerns, such as this month\u0027s\r\nspecial session on sustainable development in small island\r\ndeveloping States; on such basic human concerns as the\r\nproblems faced by older persons, women and children; on\r\nsuch human needs as proper food and shelter; or merely\r\non the chance for our people to lead a peaceful and non-\r\nviolent life in a decent environment.\r\nWe are gradually beginning, therefore, to identify the\r\nkind of relationship we wish to have with this\r\nOrganization. It is one in which the world body as a\r\nwhole assumes the role performed so well by its many\r\nworkers in the field. It does not try to take on jobs it is\r\nnot suited for; rather, it advises, it provokes, it stimulates\r\nand it helps.\r\nThis, I believe, is the way forward. For this reason,\r\nI am particularly encouraged by the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nplans for next year\u0027s millennium summit. I look forward\r\nto hearing him review and maybe more closely define the\r\nrole of the United Nations. I hope it will be along the\r\nlines I have mentioned, addressing today\u0027s problems and\r\nsuggesting tomorrow\u0027s solutions. On that note, Mr.\r\nPresident, may I assure you and the Secretary-General of\r\nour support in all your efforts on our behalf.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Myanmar, His Excellency Mr. Win\r\nAung.\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nMr. Aung (Myanmar): Allow me to begin, Mr.\r\nPresident, by extending to you the warmest congratulations\r\nof the delegation of the Union of Myanmar on your\r\nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-fourth session. Heavy and onerous indeed are the\r\nduties and responsibilities that fall upon you at this\r\nparticular session. The task before the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in any year is by no means easy. It is\r\neven less so this year, as this session has the additional task\r\nof undertaking the preparatory work for the millennium\r\nsession of next year. However, we are fully confident that\r\nyour great wealth of experience and outstanding diplomatic\r\nskills will stand you in good stead in the discharge of your\r\nresponsibilities and that you will bring this session to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. I pledge my delegation\u0027s fullest\r\ncooperation for the advancement of the work of the\r\nAssembly under your able leadership.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr.\r\nOpertti, for his invaluable contribution to the successful\r\nconclusion of the previous session of the General\r\nAssembly. Our tribute also goes to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his untiring efforts in leading the\r\nworld Organization so effectively through these extremely\r\nchallenging and difficult years.\r\nMyanmar consistently supports the principle of the\r\nuniversality of membership of this world Organization. We\r\nare therefore most delighted to see in our midst three new\r\nMembers this year. On behalf of the delegation of the\r\nUnion of Myanmar, I should like to extend our warmest\r\ncongratulations to the delegations of the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga,\r\nwhich have taken their rightful places in the Assembly.\r\nWe live in a rapidly changing world. With the end of\r\nthe cold war, the old era of the bipolar world has become\r\na thing of the past. The world is in transition from the old\r\nto the new world order, which has not fully taken shape. At\r\nthis critical juncture, the world is faced with uncertainties\r\nand unsettling situations. Sometimes, the world has even\r\nfallen victim to this turbulence and chaos.\r\nIn dealing with such situations, it is our view that any\r\nsolutions sought or measures taken, even with the best of\r\nintentions, should be in strict conformity with the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. Furthermore,\r\nuniversally recognized principles governing international\r\nrelations and the principle of respect for State sovereignty\r\nshould be taken into account before resorting to measures\r\nof an extreme nature in connection with a particular\r\nsituation.\r\nOne outstanding question relating to the reform of\r\nthe United Nations is the reform of the structure and\r\nworking methods of the Security Council. We are\r\nencouraged to see that the General Assembly has taken a\r\nsignificant procedural step by adopting a resolution on the\r\nrequirement of a two-thirds majority in taking decisions\r\nand adopting resolutions on this question.\r\nWith regard to the core issue of enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council, there are various proposals on the table\r\nregarding the possible size of the Council. As a member\r\nState of the Non-Aligned Movement, our preference is for\r\nenlargement of the Security Council up to 26 members.\r\nWe favour the expansion of the membership of the\r\nCouncil in both categories, permanent and non-permanent.\r\nIn order to overcome the current impasse on the\r\nquestion of permanent seats in the Security Council, a\r\ncompromise formula, acceptable to all parties, should be\r\nworked out through enhanced consultations and\r\ndiscussions among the Member States. We are of the\r\nview that in the event other options fail to command\r\nenough support, the idea of rotating permanent seats\r\nshould also be considered as one of the options in the\r\npermanent membership category.\r\nIn the coming year, we are going to convene a\r\nlandmark Assembly, the Millennium Assembly, and the\r\nmillennium summit. It is crucially important that the\r\nMillennium Assembly and summit should not be mere\r\nceremonial events, but should come up with concrete\r\nideas and results. As it is clearly evident that the greatest\r\nchallenge facing mankind well into the next millennium\r\nwill be economic development and poverty eradication for\r\nthe vast majority of people in the world, it is our view\r\nthat particular attention should be given to these issues.\r\nGlobalization can cut both positively and negatively.\r\nIt can bring us new opportunities as well as additional\r\nproblems. It is true that the process of globalization can\r\nfacilitate economic development and enhance the living\r\nstandards of people. But at the same time, it can make\r\nsmaller and less developed States vulnerable to the\r\nundesirable negative effects of this process. One such\r\nproblem caused by the process of globalization, is\r\ntransnational crime, including illicit trafficking in narcotic\r\ndrugs, money-laundering, trafficking in persons, arms-\r\nsmuggling, piracy and terrorism. These crimes pose\r\nserious threats to the peace and stability of mankind at\r\nboth national and regional levels. The nature of this\r\nproblem is such that it requires national, regional and\r\nglobal responses.\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that in a bid to\r\nstrengthen cooperation in the regional grouping, Myanmar\r\nhosted the second Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN) ministerial meeting on transnational crime in\r\nJune this year. The meeting was a success, and it\r\nconstituted a significant step in advancing regional\r\ncooperation in combating this menace in the South-East\r\nAsian region.\r\nLet me also address the fight against narcotic drugs in\r\nMyanmar. My Government is greatly concerned about the\r\ndrug menace, and the fight against narcotic drugs is\r\nregarded as a national task and the top priority. A master\r\nplan had been adopted to totally eradicate poppy cultivation\r\nwithin 15 years, in cooperation with ethnic leaders who\r\nsigned peace agreements with the Government. In accord\r\nwith the master plan, many areas have been declared\r\nopium-free zones and farmers are now turning to alternative\r\ncrops. Law enforcement has been stepped up in the border\r\nareas, resulting in increased seizures of narcotic drugs.\r\nWhile we are quite successful in the suppression of\r\nopium and heroin production, though only scanty\r\ninternational assistance has been received, another tide of\r\ndanger has emerged in the form of new synthetic drugs,\r\nsuch as methamphetamine. The new drugs are produced\r\naround our porous borders with precursor chemicals such\r\nas ephedrine, unavailable locally, and drug-making\r\nequipment illegally smuggled in from neighbouring\r\ncountries. We are redirecting our efforts to deal with the\r\nnew problem with the cooperation of the countries\r\nconcerned.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to apprise the\r\nAssembly briefly of the recent developments and trends\r\ntaking place in my country. My Government is against\r\nneither democracy nor human rights. As a matter of fact,\r\nwe are taking necessary steps towards the establishment of\r\na democratic nation.\r\nWe have a vision of establishing a modern, peaceful\r\nand developed democratic State. In order to bring this\r\nvision into reality, we are reconsolidating national unity as\r\nthe number one priority. Necessary foundations are being\r\nlaid for the emergence of a nation where a disciplined and\r\nmulti-party democratic system fully functions and justice,\r\nliberty and equality prevail.\r\nWe fully subscribe to the human rights norms\r\nenshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nHere, I wish to underscore that the Government does not\r\ncondone any violations of human rights, and the type of\r\ndemocracy we envision will guarantee the protection and\r\npromotion of human rights, particularly the right to the\r\nsatisfaction of basic human needs such as clothing, food\r\nand shelter. If there is an imperative need for\r\nimprovement in areas of human rights, we are willing and\r\nready to receive sensible suggestions and take whatever\r\naction we possibly can.\r\nFor instance, in the middle of this year, we received\r\na delegation from the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross (ICRC) and made detailed arrangements for them\r\nto visit the prisons in Myanmar, as a confidence-building\r\nmeasure and to enable them to interview the inmates in\r\naccordance with ICRC standard procedures. As a result of\r\nthe full cooperation we extended to the ICRC delegation,\r\nthose visits were successful and productive, enabling both\r\nsides to build mutual trust and goodwill. I consider it\r\npertinent to state here that the ICRC delegation expressed\r\ntheir satisfaction with the overall situation regarding the\r\nrelationship between the prison authorities and the\r\ninmates.\r\nAlso, in August this year, Mr. Chris Sidoti, the\r\nAustralian Human Rights Commissioner, visited Myanmar\r\nand held discussions with the authorities concerned,\r\nincluding myself, on the possibility of establishing a\r\nnational human rights institution in Myanmar exchanges\r\nof views on cooperation between the two countries on\r\nhuman rights matters. As a result of this visit, we were\r\nable to identify certain areas of cooperation between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\nIn conformity with our consistent policy of\r\nestablishing friendly and amicable relations with all\r\ncountries, we accepted the proposal for the visit of the\r\nTroika mission from the European Union to Myanmar in\r\nJuly this year. The mission was a fact-finding one, and\r\nboth sides expressed their satisfaction with the result. It\r\nis our hope that this mission will further strengthen our\r\nrelations with the European Union and pave the way for\r\nenhancing our contacts and dialogue with it towards a\r\nmore meaningful and substantive level in the future.\r\nSimilarly, we would also like to seek better relations with\r\nthe United States of America. Furthermore, I would like\r\nto confirm our willingness to receive Mr. Alvaro de Soto,\r\nthe Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Myanmar, to visit my country in the near\r\nfuture.\r\nMyanmar is a multi-ethnic society where many\r\nnational races with different and diverse cultural and\r\nsocial backgrounds reside together. In addition, primarily\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nbecause of the “divide and rule” policy under colonial rule,\r\nunity between the national races broke down and, as a\r\nresult, armed insurrections broke out all over the country.\r\nFor these reasons, the present Government came to the\r\nconclusion that racial harmony was imperative and that, in\r\nits absence, various issues would continue to hamper\r\nnational development endeavours. This rationale led the\r\nGovernment to make peace overtures to the armed groups\r\nand establish peace with them.\r\nIn order to restore trust and confidence between the\r\nnational races, the Government has even allowed the ethnic\r\narmed groups to hold on to their weapons until a\r\ndemocratic government is formally established under the\r\nnew constitution we are drafting now. This is a reflection\r\nof our trust in our national brethren. At the same time, the\r\nGovernment has launched an ambitious plan for the\r\ndevelopment of border areas and the national races there.\r\nDespite its meagre financial resources, the Government has\r\nspent over 15 billion kyats on the plan. At present, the\r\nnational races are actively working together with the\r\nGovernment in their regional development efforts. This\r\nconscious and willing involvement in national development\r\ntasks as equal partners has nurtured the Union spirit and\r\nsense of togetherness. With 17 armed groups in the legal\r\nfold, peace is holding the entire length and breadth of the\r\ncountry.\r\nAs far as the question of national unity is concerned,\r\nthis is the first ever concrete result achieved, and it is\r\nunprecedented in the number of armed groups involved and\r\nthe extent of peace established. This is a result we achieved\r\nthrough sincere, genuine and open dialogue between the\r\nGovernment and ethnic armed groups where we first built\r\nconfidence and then convinced each other of our respective\r\nobjectives. The Government is open to such a dialogue with\r\nany remaining groups, including the Karen National Union\r\n(KNU), where we could build confidence and identify\r\ncommon ground in the sole interest of the country and its\r\npeople. In this regard, I wish to reiterate that the\r\nGovernment\u0027s offer of peace to the KNU still stands.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the same dialogue is going on in\r\nthe national convention process, where representatives of\r\nnational races, political parties and delegates representing\r\nall strata of life are actively involved in drafting a new\r\nconstitution to lay a solid foundation for a new democratic\r\npolitical system. The national convention has been a\r\nsuccessful process whereby we have agreed on the basic\r\nprinciples that will govern the future life of the country and\r\nwill allow self-administered zones for certain national\r\ngroups.\r\nAt this juncture, we are in the painful and arduous\r\nprocess of building a consensus on power-sharing, which\r\nis an extremely sensitive issue for all parties concerned.\r\nIn view of the delicate nature of this sensitive question,\r\nit is vitally important for us to proceed systematically,\r\nand with the greatest caution possible, to safeguard the\r\ninterests of all the national races and not to repeat the\r\nshortcomings of the previous two constitutions.\r\nWe firmly believe that there is no better alternative\r\nto the current national convention process if we genuinely\r\nwish to transform the country into a peaceful, modern,\r\ndeveloped, and democratic State. It is therefore essential\r\nfor us to complete the national convention process.\r\nIn this connection, it is our ardent hope that the\r\ninternational community will be supportive of our sincere\r\nefforts and appreciative of the positive achievements we\r\nhave made thus far for the development of the country.\r\nMyanmar is very often portrayed from outside as if\r\nvast violations of human rights are taking place, forced\r\nlabour is rampant, a free flow of narcotics exists and\r\neconomic and social conditions are in chaos. These\r\nportrayals are in contradiction to the true situation. Let\r\nme cite here a widely known teaching of the Lord\r\nBuddha called “Kalama Sutta”. The Sutta says:\r\n“Oh, Ye Kalamas, do not be led by whatever\r\nyou are told; do not be led by whatever has been\r\nhanded down from the past generation; do not be led\r\nby hearsay or common opinion; do not be led by\r\nwhatever the scriptures say; do not be led by mere\r\nlogic; do not be led by mere deduction or inference;\r\ndo not be led by considering outward appearance; do\r\nnot be led by theory reflected as approval; do not be\r\nled by whatever a believable one says; and do not be\r\nled by what your teacher tells you is so”.\r\nIn short, Lord Buddha taught us to accept and practice\r\nonly when we ourselves know which is wrong and which\r\nis right.\r\nEveryone who visits Myanmar can see the greenness\r\nof the country, peace and tranquillity prevailing\r\nthroughout the nation, people leading their normal daily\r\nlives with happiness and pleasure and building their\r\nnation with zest and zeal. The people have full knowledge\r\nthat they are on the right path to peace and prosperity. I\r\nwould like to invite all of you to come and see for\r\nyourselves. Seeing is believing!\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nOur nation is still in the process of building; solid\r\nfoundations are being laid, and infrastructure is being\r\nimproved throughout the country. The Government and the\r\npeople fully understand where we were, where we are now\r\nand in which direction we are moving. We think of\r\nourselves as builders, carpenters and plumbers building a\r\nhouse not to enjoy ourselves, but for all the people, who\r\nare its rightful owners. When the building is finished,\r\nfurnished, furbished and fine-touched, it will be handed\r\nover to them. The people will decide who will manage the\r\nhouse.\r\nThere are some Myanmar youths who abandoned our\r\nland and took refuge elsewhere. I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to send them a message from this podium that\r\nthey will be welcomed with open arms if they return home,\r\nand I would like to invite them to join us in building the\r\nnation. Our future is in our hands. If we work together, we\r\nwill reach our goal sooner rather than later.\r\nReligious harmony and freedom are our shared\r\ntradition. Our previous two Constitutions provided for\r\nsafeguards against religious discrimination and religious\r\nintolerance. Similarly, the fundamental principles we have\r\nagreed on in the national convention process guarantee\r\nreligious indiscrimination and religious tolerance. Although\r\nMyanmar is a predominantly Buddhist country, with nearly\r\n90 per cent of the population professing Buddhism, the\r\nGovernment attaches great importance to harmonious\r\nrelations among the major religions existing in the country.\r\nAccordingly, the Government has taken all necessary steps\r\nto encourage the prevailing harmony among the religions\r\nthrough continuous contacts with the respective religious\r\nleaderships and the provision of necessary assistance in\r\nboth financial and material terms to enable them to promote\r\ntheir faiths effectively. I want to state here that there is\r\nfreedom of religion for all faiths in the country. It is also\r\nworth recalling here that a few years ago Madam Ogata, the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, remarked\r\nin her capacity as Independent Expert of the Commission\r\non Human Rights, that Myanmar was a model society as far\r\nas religious tolerance was concerned. Though these remarks\r\nwere made some time ago, I wish to stress that they remain\r\nvalid and true to this day, and that the Government is\r\ndetermined to safeguard to the best of its ability all the\r\nreligions of the country against intolerance, and to help\r\nthem in all possible ways to coexist harmoniously with each\r\nother.\r\nI cannot conclude without mentioning what my\r\ncountry is achieving on the economic front. Despite some\r\nslowdown in economic growth due to the Asian financial\r\ncrisis, Myanmar has enjoyed considerable economic\r\ngrowth in recent years. The emphasis of the Government\r\nis to promote private sector development and\r\nprivatization. At the same time, the Government is\r\nfocusing its endeavours on the development of the\r\ninfrastructure as a precondition for sustained development.\r\nMoreover, the Government is carrying out an extensive\r\nprogramme of land reclamation in wet and virgin lands by\r\ngranting large land holdings to the private companies. The\r\nprivate sector has been able to reclaim and develop 1.1\r\nmillion acres of fallow land and wetlands for agricultural\r\nproduction, which will not only help domestic food\r\nsupply but will also contribute to regional food security.\r\nWe have a vision for the new millennium, a vision\r\nof building a peaceful, modern, developed and democratic\r\nsociety. We will endeavour to realize our vision with\r\nwhatever resources we have at our disposal. The\r\nrealization of this goal could be accelerated if we receive\r\nthe support of the international community. We are\r\noptimistic that we will be able to achieve our vision, and\r\nthat the international community will demonstrate\r\nunderstanding and appreciation of our sincere efforts to\r\nuplift the economic and social well-being of the people of\r\nMyanmar.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to 5 minutes for the second intervention\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Burleigh (United States of America): This\r\nmorning Foreign Minister Pérez Roque continued Cuba\u0027s\r\ntraditional verbal attack on the United States. While this\r\nwas not surprising or even unexpected, I have an\r\nobligation to respond to at least some of the many false\r\nallegations, gross exaggerations and misconceptions about\r\nthe United States and my Government\u0027s policies that were\r\nmade in the Minister\u0027s speech.\r\nFirst, we reject the idea that the decision of a\r\nsovereign nation to restrict its citizens from certain forms\r\nof trade with another country can be classified as\r\n“genocide”. Our trade embargo against Cuba is intended\r\nto maintain pressure on the Cuban Government to observe\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\ninternationally recognized standards of human rights and to\r\nimplement pluralistic democracy.\r\nUnited States policy is clear: to reach out to the Cuban\r\npeople and to give them hope without strengthening a\r\nGovernment which withholds from its own people\r\neconomic and political choices and which fails to respect\r\nfundamental human rights.\r\nLet us be frank. First, the failure of the Cuban\r\neconomy is due to economic mismanagement by the Cuban\r\nGovernment, not the United States embargo.\r\nSecondly, it is false to assert that the United States has\r\nbanned the sale of medicines and medical supplies to Cuba.\r\nThose sales have been authorized for quite some time and\r\nare specifically allowed by United States law. My\r\nGovernment has taken concrete steps to streamline the sale\r\nof these goods, and a number of deliveries have been\r\nconfirmed. It is the Cuban Government\u0027s own policy\r\nchoices that are responsible for the inadequate health care\r\nthat ordinary Cuban citizens receive.\r\nIn a democratic society, a freely elected Government\r\nis accountable to its people for its economic and human\r\nrights policies. Respect for human rights, democratic\r\nchange and rule by the people, not over the people, are the\r\ncornerstone of prosperity and economic development.\r\nThe Cuban Government continues to blame others for\r\nits missteps while the people of Cuba pay the price. We\r\nand many others in this Hall share a belief in a simple\r\nsolution to Cuba\u0027s problems. Our advice for the Cuban\r\nGovernment is to begin now the process of democratic\r\nchange and economic reform and heed the international call\r\nto respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nI beseech the Cuban Government to lift its embargo on\r\nfreedom in its own country.\r\nOn another subject, we heard in the Assembly today\r\na wealth of charges and countercharges from the Iraqi\r\nForeign Minister concerning actions undertaken by Saddam\r\nHussein and by the international community towards Iraq.\r\nI wish to clarify a few points that may have been\r\nmisconstrued by the Iraqi representative.\r\nThe aggressive and accusatory manner in which the\r\nIraqi representative addressed my nation, and the disdain he\r\nhas shown to the international community and the bodies it\r\nhas constructed to represent it, shows how isolated Iraq has\r\nbecome and illustrates the hostile and threatening stance\r\nit still maintains in the region.\r\nThe Iraqi representative has characterized not only\r\nthe political position of my country on the Iraq issue, he\r\nhas distorted the day-to-day realities that occur in his own\r\ncountry.\r\nLooking on page 3 of the English version of\r\nMinister Al-Sahaf\u0027s statement distributed this morning, in\r\na paragraph relating to Iraq\u0027s outstanding international\r\nobligations, I see that Iraq\u0027s stated position is “nothing\r\nimportant has been left unfulfilled”.\r\nI think this is an unusual way to say that Iraq, by its\r\nown admission, is not in compliance.\r\nI thought the President of the Gambia focused,\r\npassionately and correctly, this afternoon on several\r\nquestions. For example, are the lives of Kuwaiti citizens\r\nstill unaccounted for by Iraq unimportant? Are the\r\nKuwaiti national archives, still held by Iraq, unimportant?\r\nIs the continued presence in Iraq of proscribed missiles\r\nand weapons of mass destruction considered unimportant?\r\nIt should be highlighted that not one of the members of\r\nthe Security Council, no regional organizations, no\r\ninternational experts, no one except maybe Iraq, seems to\r\nbelieve that it is in full compliance.\r\nIraq also raised the question of no-flight zones.\r\nCoalition aircraft patrolling the no-flight zones are not\r\nthere to seek targets to attack: they are there to protect\r\ncivilians, particularly the most vulnerable populations in\r\nthe north and south of the country. The civilian\r\npopulations of those areas have suffered Iraqi military\r\nattacks, including the use of poison gas against innocent\r\nwomen and children.\r\nSince January, and continuing over the past weeks,\r\nthe Iraqi regime has been repeatedly attacking coalition\r\naircraft during routine patrols of the no-flight zones.\r\nCoalition aircraft respond in self-defence only after being\r\ntargeted. Each response is conducted with a view to\r\navoiding the harming of civilians.\r\nIt is worth mentioning here that the Iraqi regime\r\ndoes not take the same precautions when initiating attacks\r\non coalition humanitarian patrols. The Iraqi regime has\r\nroutinely placed air defence systems near civilian homes.\r\nMinister Al-Sahaf confirmed in his own speech that there\r\nhave been instances where Iraqi forces have fired on\r\ncoalition aircraft and the unexploded shells from the\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nattack hit the ground, exploded, and caused death, injury\r\nand destruction in civilian areas. This underscores, yet\r\nagain and in graphic detail, Saddam Hussein\u0027s total\r\ndisregard for the welfare of his own people.\r\nThis also underscores the wider problem of Saddam\r\nHussein cynically creating a humanitarian crisis for political\r\ngain. The current leadership in Iraq is the only party\r\nresponsible for the conditions inside its territory. The Iraqi\r\nregime created the circumstances in which the Iraqi people\r\nunfortunately find themselves and it is the unwillingness of\r\nthat Iraqi leadership to meet its international obligations that\r\nperpetuates this situation.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General\u0027s conclusion that\r\nthe oil-for-food programme provides essential support in the\r\ncurrent situation. For the record, Iraq has received over $14\r\nbillion in oil revenues over the life of the programme, only\r\na third of which has gone to cover United Nations\r\nadministrative costs or to the Compensation Commission.\r\nA quick word on the Compensation Commission: this\r\nis not a punitive measure, but an internationally agreed\r\nupon mechanism to address the humanitarian and\r\nenvironmental costs sustained by the victims of Iraq\u0027s\r\naggression.\r\nIn the meantime, the oil-for-food programme has made\r\nover $10 billion available for Iraq\u0027s use in the purchase of\r\nhumanitarian goods. Ninety-four per cent of all contracts\r\nhave been approved for delivery and more than $7 billion\r\nin food, medicines, medical supplies and a wide range of\r\nhumanitarian goods have already been delivered.\r\nNonetheless, the Government of Iraq refuses to order\r\nnutritional supplements specifically for mothers and\r\nchildren, refuses to order foodstuffs necessary to complete\r\nthe food basket, refuses to release critical medicines from\r\noverstuffed warehouses brimming with needed supplies and\r\nrefuses to increase spending on essential pharmaceutical\r\nitems.\r\nIraq obstructs humanitarian work at every turn. It\r\ndoes, however, spend money on luxury palaces, political\r\npatronage and efforts to re-arm. Therefore it is no surprise\r\nthat international surveys have shown that in areas\r\ncontrolled by the Iraqi regime, child mortality figures\r\nincreased, while they decreased to levels better than before\r\nthe Gulf War in areas managed by the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to make clear for the\r\nrecord the policy of my Government on Iraq. We are\r\ncommitted to increasing humanitarian relief for the people\r\nof Iraq, over the obstructions of the regime. We are\r\ndetermined to prevent Iraq from threatening the region or\r\nits own people. And, finally, we want to see Iraq return\r\nas a respected and prosperous member of the international\r\ncommunity through the fulfilment of its promises and\r\ninternational obligations — something, sadly, we have not\r\nseen from Saddam Hussein.\r\nMr. Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): I am a history\r\nstudent who, like my other colleagues present at this\r\nmorning\u0027s plenary, has the privilege of representing the\r\npeople of Cuba at the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I also have the honour of being one of the 601\r\nDeputies to be elected in entirely free and open elections\r\nby our people and of presiding over the Federation of\r\nUniversity Students, which is an organization that was\r\nestablished in 1922 and has 70 thousand members in 47\r\ncentres of higher education. The Assembly will therefore\r\nunderstand that I do not use word games in my statement\r\nand that I do not hide behind diplomatic phrases to\r\nexpress my views. I am going to speak the truth in\r\nunrefined and direct language, as I feel it.\r\nI have listened with astonishment and indignation\r\nhow a people\u0027s history can be so clumsily misconstrued\r\nand manipulated. Allow me to give one piece of advice\r\nas a young person who, like his people, has an infinite\r\nfervour for the truth. I would like to suggest to the\r\ngentlemen who defend the blockade that they should re-\r\nenrol at one of the universities of the United States so\r\nthat they may get some credits in modern history. After\r\nhaving paid attention to what was said, I have no doubt\r\nthat they need them.\r\nThe outdated and excessive hysteria that has been\r\nrepeated in the course of nine Administrations has once\r\nagain been brought to this Hall. We have not heard a\r\nsingle word here that can refute the forceful arguments\r\nsupported by the concrete truths and quotations from\r\ndeclassified American documents made today by the\r\nMinister of my country. The world in which we live, even\r\nthough it is filled with inconceivable paradoxes, has now\r\nseen how the State that does not make its payments to the\r\nUnited Nations manipulates it on a daily basis.\r\nIn the global tragedy from which humanity is\r\nsuffering, the accusers are the ones who apply unilateral\r\nsanctions against 75 countries and bomb and launch\r\nmissiles against sovereign States at whim. In the case of\r\nCuba, the illegitimacy of the blockade — and I wish to\r\nunderline the fact that this is about a blockade, not an\r\nembargo; and to call upon the American representative to\r\n41\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nexplain to the Assembly exactly what legislation authorizes\r\nsales and commercial transactions in food and medicines —\r\nhas not only been recognized on seven consecutive\r\noccasions by the General Assembly of the United Nations\r\nas a completely illegal act, as was recalled this morning,\r\nbut it also becomes the irrefutable testimony of the\r\ninternational community\u0027s rejection of that policy. The\r\nillegitimacy of the blockade has also been reflected in the\r\ngrowing call from numerous sectors of American society\r\nfor the lifting of the blockade and for a radical alteration in\r\nthe attitude of the Government of the United States towards\r\nCuba.\r\nImportant representatives in the American Congress\r\nhave joined those in the academic, religious, labour,\r\nbusiness, press and other sectors who believe that the\r\nstrategy of blockade is absurd. In many cases, those\r\nrepresentatives have introduced significant measures to alter\r\nthat policy radically.\r\nThat my country has moved forward with a 6 per cent\r\ngrowth rate during the first half of the year; that child\r\nmortality in Cuba is six children per thousand live births;\r\nthat Cuba has attained health and educational levels\r\ncomparable to those of the most developed countries; that\r\neven in the most difficult moments not a single child,\r\nwoman, handicapped person or older person has been\r\nabandoned — these are even more revealing of what the\r\ntruth is about Cuba. These realities patently give the lie to\r\nthe allegations of the Government of the United States.\r\nCould the American Government do the same with regard\r\nto the dirty war against Cuba that has produced thousands\r\nof victims? Or with regard to the hundreds of attempts that\r\nhave been planned on the lives of our political leaders? Or\r\nwith regard to a blockade that not only violates\r\ninternational law and attempts to impose upon the rest of\r\nthe world extraterritorial laws approved in Washington, but\r\nhas also been proven to be a case of attempted genocide\r\nagainst the Cuban people? Is it perhaps the case that, in its\r\nattempt to justify itself this afternoon by justifying the\r\nunjustifiable, the delegation of the United States is in fact\r\nrevealing to us the intentions of its Government towards\r\nany other country that does not adhere to its plan for the\r\nnew order — so lacking in principles — that they are\r\ntrying to design?\r\nThe United States talks about promoting people-to-\r\npeople contacts. They even speak of promoting a general\r\nunderstanding of the blockade. This is indeed a true fallacy!\r\nIt is incredible that those who have perpetrated the\r\ngreatest human rights violations the world has ever seen\r\nshould speak of those rights. The United States has the\r\nlargest incarcerated population in the world. It has a\r\npattern of discriminating on the basis of race in its\r\nhanding down of the death penalty and other sentences.\r\nIt is a country of police brutality where politics are\r\ncommercialized and immigrants subjugated. In this city,\r\nas in the rest of the country, institutionalized corruption\r\nis called “soft money”, and its leaders hope that we will\r\nbelieve the lie that multi-millionaires and homeless\r\npersons enjoy equal rights. This is truly laughable in a\r\ncountry where the infant mortality rate for blacks is twice\r\nthat for whites.\r\nThose who are trying to present themselves as the\r\nuniversal champions of democracy are forgetting that they\r\nhave climbed into political seats with the support of a\r\nminority of the population and have turned electoral\r\ncampaigns into one of today\u0027s juiciest and most lucrative\r\nbusinesses, with hundreds of millions of dollars spent on\r\neach campaign. How much medicine, computer equipment\r\nand food for our schools, and how many hospitals would\r\nthat money buy for the Cuban population and the rest of\r\nthe third world?\r\nThe Cuban people can take the floor at this meeting\r\nwith a sense of dignity loftier than the Twin Towers,\r\nbecause they have succeeded in building a society in\r\nwhich the exercise of true democracy has become our\r\ndaily bread. That democracy means government by the\r\npeople, which in our case means discharging the mandate\r\nentrusted to us by 11 million Cubans. I do not think that\r\nthe representative could comprehend that the Parliament\r\nof the largest of the Antilles includes students, artists,\r\nfarmers, athletes, intellectuals, scientists and doctors, who\r\nstrive daily to represent our people without receiving a\r\nsingle cent in return. This scenario is incomprehensible to\r\npeople who every year stash millions of dollars in\r\npersonal bank accounts they maintain all over the world.\r\nHow can you accuse a country of violating human\r\nrights and not being democratic when thousands of\r\nprofessionals from developing countries have graduated\r\nfrom its schools, and tens of thousands of its young\r\npeople have been sent to Africa and Latin America to\r\nhelp eliminate illiteracy or save countless human lives?\r\nWe are speaking of a country that is willing to take in\r\nmore than 2,000 young people from Latin America as if\r\nthey were its own children and train them as doctors,\r\ncompletely free of charge, so that they can later return to\r\ntheir indigenous communities.\r\n42\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nI think that anyone with an ounce of common sense —\r\nand we are convinced that is something the human race can\r\nnever do without — can see that the country that should be\r\njudged is the one where a million people live in the\r\nsubway, where 43 million people have no medical\r\ninsurance, where 17 million women have been sexually\r\nassaulted and where thousands of mentally ill persons are\r\nimprisoned — the country that is responsible for the arms\r\ntrade, which kills millions of people a year.\r\nFinally, we would like to reiterate that when our\r\npeople claim that the United States blockade constitutes an\r\nact of genocide prohibited by international law — and I\r\ncould quote conventions to this effect — we do not do so\r\nonly to condemn those who have committed acts of\r\naggression against us throughout the years. We are asking,\r\non behalf of the world\u0027s multitudes and with the courage of\r\nfree and independent peoples, that the finger be pointed at\r\nthose whose Marines have intervened more than 40 times\r\nin Latin America, those who have supported military\r\ndictatorships responsible for the murders of thousands of\r\npeople. This is the country that in Viet Nam was\r\nresponsible for the deaths of 4 million human beings; that\r\nfrom its birth as a nation began to exterminate the peoples\r\nthat had lived there for centuries; that stole more than 2\r\nmillion square kilometres from Mexico; and that during the\r\nSecond World War detained 6,000 innocent Japanese\r\npeople living in the United States simply because they were\r\npossible suspects. If humankind could condemn at\r\nNuremberg the fascist criminals who were responsible for\r\nthe deaths of more than 50 million people, it can condemn\r\nalso the perpetrators of these abhorrent acts.\r\nMr. Hasan (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): The United States\r\nof America is the last country entitled to speak about\r\ninternational law or commitment to the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. The United States intervenes in the internal\r\naffairs of Iraq and those of numerous other States and sets\r\naside funds for mercenaries who have admitted perpetrating\r\nterrorist acts inside Iraq. The United States exercises State-\r\nsponsored terrorism in its most heinous form, commits daily\r\nacts of aggression against Iraq and insists on perpetuating\r\nsanctions against it. This is a form of genocide for which\r\nthe United States is responsible.\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq said that Iraq\r\nhad fulfilled the requirements of the resolutions, and we\r\nchallenge the representative of the United States of America\r\nto prove the contrary. He will say that the United Nations\r\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM) has proved the opposite,\r\nbut UNSCOM did not furnish any evidence of that. The\r\nSpecial Commission was simply spying on Iraq and has\r\nforged the results of the tests it conducted. Anything that\r\nit says lacks credibility. Anyone with self-respect would\r\nnot defend the practices of that Committee, which\r\ntransformed its offices in this building and in other places\r\ninto dens of espionage and brought in spies to work in the\r\nUnited Nations, instead of recruiting experts. It has\r\ninsulted the United Nations gravely.\r\nAs regards the distribution of foodstuffs and medical\r\nsupplies, the United States representative has falsely\r\naccused the Government of Iraq of failing to distribute\r\nfood and medicine to its people. He is trying to shirk the\r\nresponsibility of his Government for the crime of\r\ngenocide it has committed against the people of Iraq.\r\nBefore the imposition of sanctions, the Government of\r\nIraq had succeeded in achieving socio-economic\r\ndevelopment exceeding that achieved by the States of the\r\nregion and developing countries in general.\r\nBefore the imposition of sanctions, the national\r\nincome of Iraq was growing at rates that amounted to 10\r\nper cent annually. Perhaps this is the real reason for the\r\naggression against Iraq and for the imposition of\r\ncomprehensive sanctions against it. You do not want a\r\nthird-world State to exploit its resources in the interest of\r\nthe real development of its people. You are the one and\r\nonly enemy of the people of Iraq.\r\nThe United States representative claims that the\r\nimposition of the no-fly zones was designed to protect\r\ncivilians. This is a great falsehood. The United States is\r\nkilling civilians every day. It is the use of force against\r\nan independent State without mandate from the Security\r\nCouncil. All Security Council resolutions relevant to Iraq\r\nhave affirmed the sovereignty, independence and\r\nterritorial integrity of Iraq, but the United States has\r\ndisregarded such Security Council resolutions. The no-fly\r\nzones were imposed by the United States and by the\r\nUnited Kingdom and France and not by the Security\r\nCouncil; subsequently France withdrew from participating\r\nin this illegitimate act.\r\nThe official spokesman for the Secretary-General\r\nstated that the imposition of the no-fly zones has nothing\r\nto do with the United Nations. The Americans must thus\r\ncease distorting the truth.\r\n43\r\nGeneral Assembly 13th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 24 September 1999\r\nConcerning foodstuffs for children, why does the\r\nAmerican representative disregard the fact that under the\r\nleadership of the delegation of the United Kingdom, the\r\ncontracts for children\u0027s formula, water purification\r\nequipment, sewerage, medical supplies and stand-by\r\ngenerators were suspended? Half of the contracts submitted\r\nhave been suspended, and they are all humanitarian\r\ncontracts aimed at reducing the death rate among the\r\nchildren of Iraq.\r\nThe statement by the representative of the United\r\nStates is the clearest example of falsehood and distortion,\r\nonce again affirming that those who claim to lead the world\r\nare reckless political creatures who need to be led\r\nthemselves.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.15 p.m.\r\n44\r\n"
