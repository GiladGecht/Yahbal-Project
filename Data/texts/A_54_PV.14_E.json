(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 125 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/54/333/Add.3)\r\nThe President: In a letter contained in document\r\nA/54/333/Add.3, the Secretary-General informs me that,\r\nsince the issuance of his communications contained in\r\ndocument A/54/333 and addenda 1 and 2, Guinea has made\r\nthe necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the\r\namount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly takes\r\nnote of this information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now hear\r\nan address by the Vice-President of the Republic of Palau.\r\nMr. Tommy Remengesau, Jr., Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming the\r\nVice-President of the Republic of Palau, His Excellency\r\nMr. Tommy Remengesau, Jr., and inviting him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Remengesau (Palau): Let me first congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We likewise\r\nextend our appreciation to Mr. Didier Opertti, the\r\nPresident of the Assembly at its fifty-third session. We\r\nwish also to convey our appreciation and thanks to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his leadership in\r\npromoting the objectives and the mission of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI wish to convey the warm greetings of President\r\nKuniwo Nakamura, the entire leadership and the people\r\nof the Republic of Palau to the Assembly on the occasion\r\nof the fifty-fourth session. On behalf of the Government\r\nand the people of Palau, I extend our sincere appreciation\r\nto the members of this body for their assistance.\r\nSince attaining membership of the United Nations in\r\n1994, the Republic of Palau has benefitted greatly from\r\na variety of United Nations-sponsored programmes and\r\nfrom international cooperation, which have helped us play\r\nour role in promoting peace and democracy in our region.\r\nThis year, on 1 October, we proudly celebrate the fifth\r\nanniversary of our independence, which came about as a\r\nresult of a unique and very successful political treaty with\r\nthe United States of America under the Compact of Free\r\nAssociation. Diplomatic relations and economic\r\ncooperation with a growing number of members of this\r\nbody assure stability and promise great economic\r\npotential for the future.\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nBefore I proceed, let me take this rare opportunity to\r\nwelcome three of our regional neighbours — the Republic\r\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga — and to congratulate them on joining this\r\nimportant Organization.\r\nPalau also expresses its appreciation and support for\r\nthe efforts of the Security Council in promoting peace,\r\nsecurity and the protection of human rights and democracy\r\nthroughout the world, and especially in troubled areas in\r\nneed of United Nations intervention.\r\nToday we have less than 100 days left before entering\r\nthe new millennium — 97 days to be exact. There are\r\nindeed many global issues and problems that certainly\r\ndeserve our attention. The existence of the Earth in the next\r\nmillennium may, however, be in great jeopardy if the\r\nenvironment and nature\u0027s forces can no longer support the\r\nhuman population. Global warming or climate change may\r\nmerit the upmost attention and our concerted effort. I call\r\nupon every Member State, large and small, developed and\r\ndeveloping, rich and poor, to work cooperatively to find\r\nmeaningful solutions and preventive actions for this\r\ngrowing international problem and challenge. I am\r\nconfident that through sharing information on climate\r\nchange we can learn from one another and take the\r\nnecessary steps to meet this very dangerous global problem.\r\nLet me share a Palauan proverb with the Assembly,\r\none that foreshadows climate change. In Palau the winds\r\nare mainly from the east or from the west. When there are\r\neasterly winds, the sky is not so telling before the rain. As\r\nthe rain commences, one may think it is just a light shower.\r\nHowever, it actually comes in a downpour. In the old days\r\nour raincoat was simply several leaves sewn together and\r\nput over our heads. So we would get soaked through and\r\nthrough during this downpour. The message is: do not\r\nunderestimate the easterly winds, or you will get deluged\r\nwith water.\r\nThat is our message from yesterday, and it is our\r\nmessage today: do not take climate change lightly, or there\r\nwill be dire consequences. Climate change for small island\r\nnations such as the Republic of Palau has great\r\nconsequences because of our fragile ecosystem. To expand\r\non just a few examples, the El Niño phenomenon, which\r\nimpacted many communities throughout the globe, had far-\r\nreaching and devastating effects in Palau as well. At least\r\none third of all our hard coral communities died. Our reefs\r\nare home to over 500 species of corals and 1,500 species of\r\nfish, and are vibrant with marine life. The loss of our coral\r\ncommunities effects our entire ecosystem and eventually\r\nour people and their economic livelihoods. The El Niño\r\nphenomenon also caused extreme drought that dried up\r\nour main water reservoir and destroyed over 1,400\r\npatches of our most important root crop, taro, which of\r\ncourse added another burden to our daily lives.\r\nPalau and our Pacific region are also suffering from\r\nunusually high rises in tide tables, causing our farmlands\r\nto be infiltrated with salt water that eventually will have\r\ndire effects on our crops. This high sea level rise has\r\nliterally caused islands to disappear, and others are in\r\nimminent danger of disappearing. Abnormally warm\r\nocean temperatures have also caused extensive coral\r\nbleaching, and rising atmospheric temperatures devastate\r\nagriculture. According to the 1999-2000 World\r\nDevelopment Report, a 1 metre sea level rise due to\r\nclimate change would force about 70 million people to\r\nmove, and would have a dramatic effect on food security\r\nin central Asia and the Pacific. Many other examples\r\nexist, I am sure.\r\nThese few examples, and examples in other\r\ncountries, beg for global cooperation on climate change.\r\nThe Republic of Palau recognizes the link between\r\nclimate change and biodiversity, and is committed to\r\npreserving our biodiversity. Protecting our forests is one\r\nof the most effective mechanisms to slow climate change.\r\nForests, as we know, are carbon sinks, which absorb\r\ncarbon dioxide rather than releasing it as a harmful\r\ngreenhouse gas. Because of this, the destruction of forest\r\nhas a dramatic impact on climate change. The Republic\r\nof Palau has taken responsibility for its forests through\r\nthe National Forest Act and Mangrove Management Plan.\r\nProgress is being made on national regulations requiring\r\nprotective vegetative zones along our wetland and coastal\r\nareas. The Republic of Palau sponsors a summer tree\r\nplanting programme for our children in order to teach our\r\nyouth the importance of our natural resources. We are\r\ntaking steps necessary to ensure that our forests and reefs\r\nare available for future generations.\r\nThe Republic of Palau has incorporated the grave\r\nissues of climate change and rises in sea level into long-\r\nterm strategic planning. Instruments for accession to the\r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange and the Kyoto Protocol are in transmission, and\r\nwe humbly request international assistance to develop a\r\ncomprehensive vulnerability index that encompasses\r\neconomic and environmental factors like climate change.\r\nWe enthusiastically support efforts to adjust energy\r\nprices to accurately reflect the environmental\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nconsequences of fossil fuel use. Alongside climate change,\r\nenergy conservation is critical to Palau\u0027s economy and the\r\nenvironment. We have established a national policy, the\r\nNational Energy Goal, to subsidize renewable energy\r\nprogrammes, and have audited all Government facilities for\r\nenergy efficiency. At our national hospital we replaced\r\nstandard incandescent lights with energy efficient compact\r\nfluorescent lamps. Solar panels provide lights for our outer\r\nislands and isolated villages. Solar beacons light our reef\r\nchannels. Our national energy programme and public utility\r\ncorporation are in partnership with the Million Solar\r\nRooftops initiative to educate the public about renewable\r\nenergy applications. Let us start off the new century with\r\na dynamic move away from fossil fuels and towards a\r\ncommitment to environment friendly energy alternatives.\r\nEntering into relevant agreements and conventions\r\nwhich target international response to environmental issues\r\nis another responsibility that our Republic has to its people\r\nand this world community. It is one that we are fulfilling as\r\ntime goes on, being a signatory and party to eight\r\ninternational agreements, including the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe Republic of Palau views climate change as being\r\nin the forefront of issues that need to be addressed, and that\r\ncan only be effectively addressed if all Member States\r\nmeaningfully contribute on the basis of common but\r\ndifferentiated responsibilities. The use of the Kyoto\r\nmechanisms is an integral component of a global solution\r\nto the issue of climate change. Therefore, it is critical that\r\nno artificial restrictions be placed on the use of these\r\nmechanisms. If we can all come to terms with the intent of\r\nthe Kyoto mechanisms and develop a fair and realistic\r\napproach to their use, there will be no sufficient reason why\r\nwe cannot enter the new millennium with positive remedies\r\nto the issue of climate change. Maybe we can even enter\r\nthe new millennium with a breath of fresh air.\r\nAs we travel towards the new millennium, let us move\r\nforward with the tools that we have developed as an\r\ninternational family, so that the benefits, although they may\r\ngo unseen in our generation, may be fully appreciated by\r\nour children and their children. These initiatives shall be\r\nour imprint, our assurance of a healthier environment for\r\ngenerations to come.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Vice-President of the Republic of Palau\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tommy Remengesau, Jr., Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral Debate\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Belarus, His Excellency Mr. Ural Latypov.\r\nMr. Latypov (Belarus): Please, Sir, accept my most\r\nsincere congratulations on your election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at this session, as well as my\r\nwishes for every success in the discharge of this complex\r\nand responsible mission. We are thankful for the work of\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti. We also greatly\r\nappreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, to effectively and energetically lead our\r\nOrganization.\r\nBelarus welcomes the enlargement of the United\r\nNations family of nations, which recently accepted three\r\nnew members: the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\r\nbeing held at the doorway between centuries and\r\nmillennia. This fact alone urges us to take an in-depth\r\nlook at both the past and the present of the United\r\nNations and to think about its future. The expanding\r\nglobal challenges, especially ethnic conflicts, deterioration\r\nof the environment, transnational crime and terrorism can\r\nbe met only by concerted efforts of the United Nations.\r\nBelarus will be actively contributing to the formation\r\nof a new image of the United Nations as an organization\r\ncapable of tackling the challenges of the day. Our country\r\nwas among the Organization\u0027s founding members, who\r\nbestowed upon the United Nations such high and noble\r\ngoals and principles. We are interested in their\r\nconsolidation and development.\r\nThis year the Organization experienced what was\r\nprobably one of the most serious tests in its entire history.\r\nThe United Nations was virtually marginalized during the\r\ncrisis around Yugoslavia. The decision to use military\r\nforce against a sovereign State was taken without the\r\nauthorization of the Security Council.\r\nAlthough the settlement of the Kosovo crisis has\r\nnow been brought back under the auspices of the United\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nNations, a recurrence of attempts to randomly use force\r\noutside the Security Council mechanism cannot be\r\nexcluded. Consequently, the question as to whether the\r\nSecurity Council should remain the only — I reiterate, the\r\nonly — international institution to authorize the use of force\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security as\r\nyet remains unanswered.\r\nThe answer that is today given to this question will\r\ndetermine developments in the twenty-first century. Will it\r\nbe the age of fairness and the rule of law, or will the world\r\nbe thrown back into the era when force was the only\r\nargument? From a historical perspective, such a\r\ndevelopment would return us to the beginning of this\r\ncentury. Let us recall that the dawn of the twentieth century\r\nsaw nations divided into two categories: subjects and\r\nobjects of international law, with their fate totally\r\ndependent upon their ability to defend themselves by\r\nmilitary force.\r\nI believe that a totally different world order would\r\nmost adequately meet the interests of all members of the\r\ninternational community. This is a world order in which all\r\ncountries are equal and are protected by international law\r\nand the United Nations. The prerogative of the Security\r\nCouncil to establish and maintain peace and security is a\r\nkey element of this system.\r\nNaturally this places a special burden of responsibility\r\non the Security Council and its members. We view the\r\nincrease in both permanent and non-permanent members of\r\nthe Council on the basis of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution to be an important measure that would improve\r\nthe Council\u0027s effectiveness.\r\nGuided by the intention to contribute further to\r\nstrengthening peace and security, Belarus has presented its\r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil for the period 2002-2003. The elections will be\r\nheld in 2001, during the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAs regards the responsibility of the United Nations for\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security, I would also like to\r\nunderline the need to make fuller use of the entire set of\r\nmeasures envisaged in the Charter. Special emphasis should\r\nbe put on the prevention of conflicts by peaceful means,\r\nwhich, if applied in a consistent and efficient manner,\r\nwould produce substantial results. This can be explicitly\r\nillustrated by recent positive developments in the Middle\r\nEast peace process, which Belarus welcomes and supports.\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to reaffirm the readiness\r\nof the Government of the Republic of Belarus to\r\ncontribute actively to the resolution of conflicts in post-\r\nSoviet countries and, in particular, to host in our capital,\r\nMinsk, the international conference on Nagorny\r\nKarabakh.\r\nMore than half a century ago, sovereign States,\r\nincluding Belarus, founded the United Nations to\r\n“reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the\r\ndignity and worth of the human person”. To uphold its\r\nlegal and moral commitments the international community\r\ncannot and must not remain inactive in the face of gross\r\nand systematic violations of human rights. Genocide in\r\nRwanda, events in East Timor — these and similar\r\noccurrences must lead to immediate and decisive action\r\non the part of the United Nations. But such action must\r\nbe taken in full compliance with the decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nAt the same time it is obvious that the sacred\r\nprinciple of the protection of human rights, once\r\ninterpreted selectively, becomes meaningless.\r\nUnfortunately, double standards in the interpretation of\r\nthe notion of human rights are still applied all too often\r\nin international politics. It would be dangerously\r\nmisleading to assume that human rights can be protected\r\nby means that ignore the principle of the sovereign\r\nequality of States. Disregarding State interests in the\r\npursuit of individual values can cause unpredictable\r\nconsequences.\r\nGlobalization is creating a situation in which the\r\nprosperity and even more the underdevelopment of certain\r\nregions, or conflicts in them, directly affect the global\r\nstate of affairs. From this perspective, the developments\r\nof the twenty-first century will be largely influenced by\r\nprocesses taking shape in the enormous Eurasian region,\r\nof which my country is an integral part.\r\nMulti-ethnic and multi-confessional Belarus has,\r\nthank God, avoided the religious and ethnic conflicts that\r\nhave been so characteristic of many post-Soviet countries.\r\nDuly organized governmental management and law\r\nenforcement systems have allowed us to ensure an\r\nadequate level of security for our society and people.\r\nSituated on the crossroads between the east and the west,\r\nthe north and the south of the continent, Belarus will be\r\nfurther contributing to international cooperation in\r\ncombating transborder crime, terrorism and illicit drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nA few days ago Belarus became party to the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist\r\nBombings. We also support the idea of holding a United\r\nNations conference or a special session of the General\r\nAssembly on the suppression of terrorism.\r\nBelarus is ready to cooperate most actively with all\r\nmembers of the international community to address these\r\nand other global and regional challenges. Openness to\r\nmutually beneficial cooperation is probably one of the main\r\nfeatures of Belarus\u0027 foreign policy, which sincerely seeks to\r\nestablish a network of good neighbourly relations\r\nembracing our country.\r\nAlthough consistent in its principled position on the\r\nenlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO), Belarus demonstrates good will and acts\r\nconstructively to prevent the re-emergence of new dividing\r\nlines in Europe. In this context, we support the idea of\r\nadopting, at the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (OSCE) summit in Istanbul, the charter for\r\nEuropean security, which is to become a code of behaviour\r\nfor all of Europe.\r\nHistorically and geographically belonging to European\r\ncivilization, Belarus is seeking to become a full fledged\r\nmember of integration processes on the continent. The\r\nrapprochement between Belarus and Russia is in line with\r\nprocesses of global development. The consolidation of\r\nefforts by Belarus and Russia, enjoying wide public support\r\nin both countries, allows us to more effectively solve\r\nproblems faced by the two States and two peoples.\r\nBelarus has become a full fledged member of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM). We share the values and\r\nphilosophy of the Movement and the provisions of the\r\nNAM Plan of Action that are consonant with the United\r\nNations principles and objectives, as well as with the global\r\nchallenges of establishing a multipolar world order.\r\nRegrettably, the world is entering the new century\r\nwith the burden of arms so powerful they can extinguish all\r\nlife on the planet. For this reason, disarmament, especially\r\nin the nuclear sphere, remains among the main priorities of\r\nthe United Nations. A few years ago, Belarus made an\r\nhistoric choice by relinquishing the possession of nuclear\r\narms inherited from the former Soviet Union. Now, we\r\nurge all countries which have not yet become parties to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\r\nto join those that have made the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world their utmost priority. We also stand for\r\nan early agreement on the prohibition of the production of\r\nfissile materials.\r\nIn conditions in which the nuclear Powers are still\r\nnot ready fully to relinquish the possession of such arms,\r\nthere is a pressing need to withdraw them from as much\r\nof the world as possible, especially from heavily\r\npopulated regions. Proceeding from this, we once again\r\ncall on countries of our region to review their attitudes\r\ntowards the initiative put forward by President\r\nLukashenka of Belarus on the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free space in Central and Eastern Europe, as\r\nreflected in the relevant resolutions of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly. The assumption by countries of our\r\nregion of binding legal commitments not to deploy\r\nnuclear weapons on their territory would be of paramount\r\nimportance to the security of the European family of\r\nnations. I believe that, sooner or later, all our neighbours\r\nwill arrive at this obvious conclusion. Since time is of the\r\nessence, we propose to begin consultations immediately\r\nwith all interested parties to exchange ideas and bridge\r\npositions on this problem.\r\nOther types of weapons of mass destruction are by\r\nno means less dangerous. We welcome the appeal voiced\r\nfrom this high rostrum to protect our children from the\r\nscourge of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare. We\r\nbelieve that the international community would be taking\r\nthe right step if it were to establish a preventive\r\nmechanism to take timely and coordinated measures to\r\ncontrol the development and production of new types of\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nProceeding from this, the Belarus delegation at this\r\nsession will initiate a draft resolution on the prohibition\r\nof the development and manufacture of new types of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and new systems of such\r\nweapons. Likewise, we support the proposal to adopt a\r\nresolution on the consolidation of and respect for the\r\nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\r\nAs was rightly observed in this Hall, the strength\r\nand effectiveness of the United Nations depend on the\r\nsustainable development of its Member States. Having\r\nachieved independence, Belarus has chosen its own model\r\nof economic development which adequately reflects its\r\nnational conditions and capacity. This is a model socially\r\noriented market economy. Our objective is not simply the\r\nimplementation of reforms for their own sake, but the\r\nachievement of a more effective economy. In recent\r\nyears, we have been maintaining a positive dynamic of\r\ngross domestic product growth that, in 1998, was up by\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\n8 per cent. Belarus is a self-reliant country. Our outstanding\r\ndebt is only $133 per capita.\r\nAn open economy, Belarus exports more than half of\r\nits gross domestic product and is taking energetic measures\r\nto find an appropriate place in the international division of\r\nlabour. Our country has all the necessary prerequisites for\r\nthat, including extensive technical and scientific potential\r\nand human resources. Economic performance is essential\r\nfor safeguarding social stability. The development of\r\ndemocratic institutions is an integral part of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Mindful of that, the Government of Belarus\r\nhas initiated a broad dialogue between all political forces in\r\nthe country in an effort to jointly analyze avenues for the\r\nfurther political development of Belarus at the beginning of\r\nthe twenty-first century. The parliamentary elections in\r\n2000 and the presidential elections in 2001 should play an\r\nimportant role in this process. The Government of Belarus\r\nwill make every effort to conduct these elections\r\ndemocratically and freely.\r\nAmong the important global challenges facing the\r\nUnited Nations is the protection of the environment and the\r\nalleviation of the negative consequences of natural disasters\r\nand technological catastrophes. For more than 13 years\r\nnow, this has been a matter of survival for the Belarusian\r\nnation. The elimination of the consequences of the\r\nChernobyl disaster accounts for almost 20 per cent of our\r\nannual budget spending. I take this opportunity to express\r\nmost sincere gratitude to all the States and international\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations\r\nwhich throughout these years have never been dispassionate\r\nabout the tragedy of the Belarusian people. Positively\r\nassessing the efforts of the United Nations, Belarus today\r\ncalls upon the international community to continue\r\ncooperation and strengthen the United Nations role in this\r\ndirection. Together with the Russian Federation and\r\nUkraine, Belarus will present a draft resolution on this issue\r\nat the current session. We are hopeful that the United\r\nNations Member States will render their valuable support.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is an\r\nimportant stage in preparing for the Millennium Assembly\r\nthat should take practical decisions worthy of this forum.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus has proposed as a subject for\r\ndiscussion at the 2000 Assembly the issue of the United\r\nNations role in the furtherance of peace and human\r\nsustainable development in conditions of globalization.\r\nAware of the historic importance of this event, Belarus will\r\nactively contribute to the success of the Millennium\r\nAssembly and Summit and reaffirms its commitment to the\r\ngoals and principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea, His Excellency Mr. Paek Nam Sun.\r\nMr. Paek Nam Sun (Democratic People\u0027s Republic\r\nof Korea) (spoke in Korean; English text furnished by the\r\ndelegation): At the outset, please allow me to express, on\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea, our pleasure on congratulating you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We believe that your\r\ndiplomatic skill and rich experience will greatly contribute\r\nto our work at this session.\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to extend my\r\ngratitude to Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Uruguay, for his tangible\r\ncontribution to United Nations activities during his tenure\r\nof his office as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-third session. I also express appreciation for the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General towards strengthening the\r\nfunctions and the role of the United Nations.\r\nThe current session, which is being held at the\r\nhistoric turn of the century, has an important mission to\r\ngive new hope to humankind. The challenges and the\r\ndifficulties facing international society are growing ever\r\nmore complex and intricate. The cold war has ended but\r\ndomination and hegemony continue to exist. High-\r\nhandedness and arbitrariness continue to pose major\r\nthreats to international peace and security. Because of the\r\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness, so prevalent in\r\ninternational relations, the principles of justice and\r\nfairness are often disregarded and the principle of\r\nsovereign equality — a lifeline to United Nations\r\nactivities — is shaken to its very foundation.\r\nMoreover, we have recently seen grave situations\r\nwhereby the internal affairs of sovereign States are\r\ninterfered in by force. Today international society must\r\nchoose one of the two following options: whether the\r\ntwenty-first century will be a century of independence,\r\nequality and peace, or whether it will be a century of\r\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness. If we choose the latter,\r\nall countries with weak national defence capabilities will\r\nbe vulnerable to bombing, as was the case in Yugoslavia.\r\nAs we are all well aware, the Korean peninsula\r\nstands at the centre of international peace and security.\r\nTherefore, as a party directly concerned, I wish to take\r\nthis opportunity to present the details of views and\r\npositions regarding the present situation there. This will,\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nwe believe, be a most effective contribution to the work of\r\nthe current session.\r\nAt present, the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea\r\nis being blatantly portrayed as a dangerous area of nuclear\r\nweapons proliferation and a source of missile threats. For\r\nexample, an empty tunnel is suspected of being an\r\nunderground nuclear facility and a satellite is labelled a\r\nballistic missile. These are now being used as pretexts for\r\nreviving a “star wars” plan, a phantom of the cold war, in\r\na variant named “the missile defence system”. Meanwhile,\r\nthe attempts of a defeated State to rearm and to re-emerge\r\nas a military power are being accelerated at the fastest\r\npossible speed and even a debate calling for nuclear\r\narmaments has come to the fore.\r\nPursuant to operation plan 502798, aimed at\r\npreemptive attacks against the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea, large-scale strike forces have been\r\nsurreptitiously amassed in and around South Korea. They\r\nare entering into actual combat readiness through various\r\njoint military exercises. It is becoming almost a reality, not\r\nsimply an assumption, that the Korean peninsula will\r\nbecome a second Balkans. In the Balkan region, a\r\nhumanitarian crisis served as a pretext for war, whereas on\r\nthe Korean peninsula, the so-called missile issue is likely to\r\nbe used instead.\r\nOur satellite launch is an exercise of equal rights in\r\nthe use of outer space that is recognized by the United\r\nNations. Strengthening our national defence capabilities is\r\nan exercise of our sovereign right of legitimate defence: it\r\ndoes not constitute a violation of any obligations the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea has under existing\r\ninternational treaties. Nevertheless, the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea has become a target of United States\r\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness. The reason is very clear:\r\nplacing the entire Korean peninsula under its control is a\r\ntop priority of the Asia strategy of the United States. As\r\nYugoslavia becomes an impediment to United States\r\ndomination over the Balkan area, so the adherence of the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea to socialism is\r\nconsidered an obstacle to its Asia strategy.\r\nMuch the same can be said about why Japan is so\r\nhysterically resorting to a campaign against the Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of Korea. Japan has not liquidated its\r\npast crimes against the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea, alone amongst countries. Japan is miscalculating\r\nthat, if the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea were\r\nstifled, the issue of liquidating its past crimes would fade\r\naway by itself. Not only that, Japan is fabricating threats,\r\none after the other, as an excuse to become a military\r\nPower.\r\nOur people love peace and aspire to it even more\r\nthan others: they lived for the first half of this century\r\nunder the colonial rule of Japan and they have been living\r\nfor the second in a state of belligerence with the United\r\nStates. Nevertheless, we do not beg for peace: we want a\r\npeace in which we can enjoy an independent life, not the\r\npeace of slaves denied all freedom.\r\nSovereignty is the lifeline of the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea and socialism is the life of our people.\r\nIt is the unshakeable will of our people, and State policy\r\nof the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea, to defend,\r\nconsolidate and develop to the utmost our own style of\r\nsocialism, chosen by the people themselves. This is an\r\nexercise of the right to self-determination and freedom of\r\nchoice recognized by the United Nations. The present-day\r\nconfrontation on the Korean peninsula is in essence a\r\nconfrontation between those who are masters of their own\r\ncountry trying to defend all that is theirs and the foreign\r\nforces attempting to harm them. This is the main factor\r\nunderlying the continuing instability on the Korean\r\npeninsula.\r\nHerein also lies the answer to the question of who is\r\nposing a threat to whom. It is not easy for our people,\r\nwhose territory and population are small and who still\r\nlack almost everything, to defend their sovereignty single-\r\nhandedly in the face of the collective, hostile power\r\npolitics of the United States and its forces of\r\nsubordination. We have no alternative but to strengthen\r\nour national defence capability ourselves, although this\r\nmeans we must tighten our belts. Because of our lack of\r\ncapacity, Comrade Kim Jong Il, the great leader of our\r\npeople, is employing an “army first” policy. This policy\r\nis our own unique way of uniting the whole people with\r\nthe army into a bulwark, thus enabling us both to defend\r\nthe country and develop its economy. Despite the\r\npersistent political, military and economic moves of\r\nhostile forces to suffocate us, up until now we have\r\nsucceeded in defending our sovereignty and preventing\r\nanother war on the Korean peninsula. This proves the\r\nstrength of the “army first” policy, for defending\r\nsocialism and ensuring peace with weapons.\r\nThe way to ensure lasting peace and security on the\r\nKorean peninsula is to end the hostile relations between\r\nthe Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea and the\r\nUnited States and reunify Korea. The Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States are still in a\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nstate of temporary armistice. Easing tension on the Korean\r\npeninsula and eliminating the danger of war will be\r\npossible when the United States discards, among other\r\nthings, its hostile policy against the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea and concludes a peace agreement with\r\nit. There is no convincing reason why the United States\r\nmust continue to antagonize the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea alone in north-east Asia, almost 10 years\r\nafter the end of the cold war. We do not want war, but we\r\ndo strive to achieve the peaceful reunification of our\r\ncountry.\r\nWe have already made it clear that we would not\r\nregard the United States as a permanent enemy. We have\r\nalso fully shown our good faith through our sincere\r\nimplementation over the last five years of the Agreed\r\nFramework between the United States and the Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of Korea. We have also made it clear\r\nthat, while we will make continued efforts to catch up with\r\nneighbouring countries in the field of peaceful space\r\nactivities, we are ready for discussions on the missile issue\r\nat any time, if hostile nations are sincere in their intentions\r\nto dispel our concern. Now it is the turn of the United\r\nStates to prove its good faith to us with deeds, if it does not\r\nharbour ill intent towards the Democratic People\u0027s Republic\r\nof Korea. It is fortunate that the United States has recently\r\ndecided on a partial lifting of economic sanctions against\r\nthe Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea, but we look\r\nforward to a comprehensive and genuine lifting of them all.\r\nIf the United States stops pursuing its hostile policy\r\ntowards the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea and\r\nmoves towards improved relations, we also will respond\r\nwith good faith. For the present, we are to have high-level\r\ntalks towards a settlement of outstanding issues between the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea and the United\r\nStates. These are to be held in response to the request from\r\nthe United States, and missile launches will be suspended\r\nwhile the talks are under way.\r\nThe United States should not attempt to test the\r\nstrength of our military capability or frighten and subdue\r\nour people with military threats and provocations. Reckless\r\nacts such as these will surely result in a strong self-defence\r\nresponse with possibly catastrophic consequences.\r\nThe United Nations should fulfil its responsibility for\r\nensuring peace on the Korean peninsula by implementing,\r\nas early as possible, General Assembly resolution 3390\r\n(XXX) B, calling for dissolution of the United Nations\r\nCommand.\r\nThe early achievement of national reunification is\r\nthe long-cherished desire of our nation. At the same time,\r\nit is a prerequisite for ensuring durable peace and security\r\non the Korean peninsula. As long as Korea remains\r\ndivided, the situation on the Korean peninsula and its\r\nsurrounding areas will never be stable. This is detrimental\r\nto peace in Asia and also in the rest of the world.\r\nWe have already established national reunification\r\nprinciples. The three principles of independence, peaceful\r\nreunification and great national unity, which the North\r\nand South of Korea confirmed and made public at home\r\nand abroad, in the 4 July joint statement, constitute the\r\ngrand reunification programme. They form the\r\ncornerstone of national reunification, which the United\r\nNations officially welcomed in the resolution adopted at\r\nthe twentieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe most above board and reasonable way to\r\nachieve reunification is the confederal formula, by which\r\nthe North and South of Korea would be able to realize\r\nnational reunification fairly and smoothly on the basis of\r\npreserving each other\u0027s ideas and systems as they are.\r\nAny attempts by one side to change the other, to make\r\nclaims about the “sunshine policy” and engagement, while\r\nignoring the reality that two different ideas and systems\r\nare existing in the North and South, will only mean\r\nconfrontations and conflict.\r\nIn order to eliminate confrontations between the\r\nNorth and the South, and to promote national\r\nreconciliation and unity, the South Korean authorities\r\nshould abolish, inter alia, the national security law, which\r\nhas identified fellow countrymen as the enemy. The fact\r\nthat delegates of patriotic organizations for reunification\r\nin South Korea who visited Pyongyang last August were\r\nimprisoned, because of their participation in the grand\r\nreunification festival, shows a clear picture of anti-\r\nreunification acts and human rights violations by South\r\nKorean authorities wielding the national security law. The\r\nSouth Korean authorities are now talking about\r\nreconciliation and cooperation with the North. But behind\r\nthe scenes, they are criminalizing contacts and exchanges\r\namong the people and other personages of the North and\r\nSouth of Korea and are suppressing patriotic reunification\r\nforces by invoking the national security law.\r\nTherefore, as long as the national security law and\r\nanti-national and anti-reunification law remains in place,\r\nit is impossible to achieve national reconciliation and\r\nunity and realize contacts and exchanges between the\r\nNorth and South of Korea. Only when the South Korean\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nauthorities take an attitude of national independence and\r\npatriotism, instead of depending upon foreign forces and\r\ncollaborating with them, will North-South relations become\r\ncharacterized by trust and reconciliation and will a decisive\r\nbreakthrough be opened for reunification.\r\nOn 18 April of last year, the respected General Kim\r\nJong Il put forward the five point policy of great national\r\nunity to hasten the independent and peaceful reunification\r\nof the country. That policy is, first, to base oneself on the\r\nprinciple of national reunification; secondly, to unite the\r\nwhole nation under the banners of patriotism and national\r\nreunification; thirdly, to improve North-South relations;\r\nfourthly, to struggle against alien domination and anti-\r\nreunification forces; and fifthly, to develop exchanges,\r\ncontacts and dialogues and to strengthen solidarity and\r\ncoalition throughout the entire nation.\r\nGreat unity of the whole nation would be national\r\nreunification. Even though there are still numerous\r\ndifficulties and obstacles in the way of national\r\nreunification, we are optimistic about its prospects. Our\r\nnation is one, and so is our motherland. Under the banner\r\nof national reunification, our nation will achieve great\r\nnational unity without fail.\r\nThe twenty-first century should be a century of\r\nindependence, in which “dominationism” and high-\r\nhandedness are eliminated and the sovereignty of all States\r\nis equally respected. In order to bring about a new century\r\nof independence and of durable peace, a just international\r\norder that never tolerates high-handedness and arbitrariness\r\nshould be established.\r\nTo this end, the principle of respect for sovereignty\r\nshould be strictly adhered to as the supreme principle in\r\ninternational relations. The assertion that disarmament,\r\nhuman rights and humanitarian issues should be placed\r\nabove sovereignty should be firmly denounced as a\r\ndangerous attempt to justify both high-handedness and\r\narbitrariness. Disputes cannot be properly settled by high-\r\nhanded and arbitrary measures, such as sanctions and the\r\nuse of force. They should be resolved through dialogue and\r\nnegotiation on all accounts.\r\nCountries of Africa and the Middle East that are\r\ninsisting they should be responsible for resolving their\r\nissues through dialogue and negotiations are enjoying the\r\nsupport of the international community. What is important\r\nin establishing a just international order is to ensure fairness\r\nin the formulation and application of international treaties\r\nrelating to disarmament, human rights and so forth. In\r\nparticular, the double standard of abusing international\r\nlaw as a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of\r\nsovereign States and the use of force against sovereign\r\nStates should be strictly rejected.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to fulfil its\r\nresponsibilities and its role in accordance with the\r\nCharter, democracy should be practised in United Nations\r\nactivities. Without enhancing the authority of the General\r\nAssembly, and without an early restructuring of the\r\nSecurity Council, the United Nations will be unable to\r\nmeet the demands of a rapidly changing situation and to\r\ncope with new challenges. The authority of the General\r\nAssembly, where all Member States are represented and\r\ninteract democratically on an equal footing, should be\r\nenhanced.\r\nIf the General Assembly is empowered to deliberate\r\non crucial issues, such as ensuring international peace and\r\nsecurity, and finally examines important Security Council\r\nresolutions concerning sanctions and the use of force, this\r\nwill be conducive to ensuring fairness in United Nations\r\nactivities and preventing arbitrariness by individual\r\ncountries. The Security Council should be reformed in\r\nsuch a way as to have all regions equally represented in\r\nits composition and to ensure full transparency in all of\r\nits activities.\r\nIn this regard, we oppose under any circumstances\r\nthe permanent membership of a defeated nation that has\r\nnot liquidated its past crimes. We are of the view that the\r\nproposal put forward by member countries of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement to first increase non-permanent seats,\r\nwhich is relatively easy to agree upon at this stage,\r\ndeserves sincere consideration. Since the Security Council\r\nis taking its actions on behalf of the general United\r\nNations membership, its working methods and,\r\nparticularly, decision-making processes should be made\r\nmore transparent for all of the Member States.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea will continue to maintain\r\nindependence, peace and friendship as the fundamental\r\nideals of its foreign policy.\r\nWe are convinced that attaching importance to\r\nindependence, peace and friendship in international\r\nrelations conforms with the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations and makes a contribution to peace and\r\nsecurity on the Korean peninsula, in Asia and in the rest\r\nof the world.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nIn conclusion, I assure the Assembly that the\r\ndelegation of the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea\r\nwill make sincere efforts for the success of the current\r\nsession and will extend its active cooperation to the work\r\nof the presidency.\r\nThe President: The next speaker is the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Thailand, His Excellency Mr. Surin\r\nPitsuwan.\r\nMr. Pitsuwan (Thailand): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Thailand, I extend my warm\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, upon your unanimous election\r\nto the presidency of the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I am confident that with your leadership and\r\nexperience this session will complete its work successfully\r\nand set the stage for the Millennium Assembly and the\r\nmillennium summit next year.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to Mr. Didier Opertti, President of the Assembly at\r\nits fifty-third session. My delegation truly appreciates his\r\nleadership and his tireless dedication to the heavy\r\nresponsibilities entrusted to him during the past year.\r\nMay I on behalf of the Government and people of\r\nThailand congratulate the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic\r\nof Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on their admission as\r\nnew Members of the United Nations, which further\r\nreinforces the universal character of the Organization.\r\nAs we gather on the threshold of the new millennium,\r\nwe find the United Nations and the international community\r\nare still preoccupied with maintaining international peace\r\nand security. Yet this is only one of the many purposes of\r\nour Organization; to achieving international cooperation in\r\nsolving international problems of an economic, social,\r\ncultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and\r\nencouraging respect for human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms for all is no less an important goal in our Charter.\r\nInvariably, the traditional security paradigm\r\npredominates in the discussions and ensuing actions\r\nregarding international peace and security. A decade after\r\nthe end of the cold war, global and regional organizations\r\ntend to focus their efforts primarily on traditional security\r\nconcepts and related tools for solving security problems. In\r\nSouth-East Asia, the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF), which deals\r\nwith some aspects of security issues in this traditional\r\nsense.\r\nBut the traditional concepts of security are woefully\r\ninadequate to meet the new challenges faced by mankind.\r\nThe very narrow scope of its definition serves as an\r\nintellectual strait-jacket which limits our ability to\r\nconceptualize and respond to new threats of our time.\r\nThis fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\r\nbeing conducted under the menacing shadows of the\r\nconflicts in Kosovo and East Timor. All of us are\r\npreoccupied with the implications and consequences of\r\nthe ways in which we choose to handle these conflicts.\r\nMore and more, we in the international community\r\nare being faced with conflicts within States, not between\r\nor among States, as in the past. Rather than State rights,\r\nState interests, State sovereignty, we now have to grapple\r\nwith the defence of the common good, the protection of\r\nrights beyond borders and intervention to promote and\r\nsafeguard humanitarian ideals and objectives.\r\nOur Organization is now being challenged to provide\r\nclear guidelines for the collective pursuit of these new\r\nlofty goals and this complex agenda. Unless and until we,\r\nas the foremost Assembly of mankind, come up with\r\ncriteria, objective and consensual, the international\r\ncommunity will not be able to address the many lurking\r\ninternal conflicts effectively. The period between now and\r\nthe millennium summit next September is an opportune\r\ntime for our collective deliberation on this issue. And I\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in\r\nlaunching the process of consultation at the beginning of\r\nthe session. My delegation pledges its full cooperation\r\nwith him and with all representatives in the Assembly for\r\nthe successful outcome of this historic search.\r\nBut let us not forget that before we can protect and\r\npromote those common interests, save rights beyond\r\nborders and think about intervention on the ground of\r\nhumanitarian concerns, we have to make sure that we are\r\nin agreement about what it is that we must, that we want\r\nto, protect and promote.\r\nI propose that we should begin to change our\r\ntraditional, exclusive preoccupation with the security and\r\nsovereignty of States to serious consideration on the\r\nemerging concept of human security. It is a concept\r\nwhich attempts to take us beyond the traditional meaning\r\nof security, by addressing new issues. The scope of what\r\nfalls within the realm of human security is still not yet\r\nwell defined, except to place people at the centre of our\r\ndefinition of security. Security is now people-related more\r\nthan State-related.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nOne interpretation of human security in vogue includes\r\nupholding human dignity, protecting and promoting human\r\nrights and use of humanitarian law, shielding women,\r\nchildren and non-combatants from the effects of armed\r\nconflicts, and combating terrorism. We have also seen\r\nconcerted action to meet these objectives through joint\r\nefforts to eradicate anti-personnel landmines, prevent the\r\nproliferation of small arms and struggle against organized\r\ncrime. This somewhat limited interpretation of human\r\nsecurity emphasizes physical protection of the human\r\nperson, and strives to provide human beings with freedom\r\nfrom fear. This is a step in the right direction.\r\nBut it is not sufficient. We think human security\r\nshould be more comprehensive. Can we afford to continue\r\nto attach less importance to addressing the social and\r\neconomic dimensions of human security? Can we honestly\r\nenjoy genuine security amidst l.3 billion people who live on\r\nless than $1 a day, or another 840 million who remain\r\nmalnourished? Can we fully enjoy freedom from fear\r\nwithout having freedom from want, which emanates from\r\nliving in an environment free from infectious disease,\r\nilliteracy, poverty, natural disaster and social unrest? If we\r\nare to give importance to protecting children from harmful\r\neffects during times of war, should we not give equal\r\nimportance to providing children with basic benefits during\r\ntimes of peace? We cannot turn a blind eye to the need to\r\nsecure for people their freedom from want. We believe that\r\nhuman beings will begin to enjoy genuine security only if\r\nthey have a chance to make a living, to be able to stand on\r\ntheir own two feet, to have equal opportunities to develop\r\ntheir livelihoods and to make their own decisions about\r\ntheir own futures. This will not happen so long as people\r\nare threatened by socio-economic ills such as poverty,\r\ndisease, environmental degradation and social vices,\r\nincluding drugs.\r\nThe need to pursue human security in such a broader\r\nand more comprehensive definition is made even more\r\nurgent by the multifaceted challenges that we face from\r\nunbridled globalization. Granted, globalization has created\r\nmany important opportunities and benefits, such as the\r\ncreation of more competitive world markets, which has led\r\nto greater efficiencies in production and faster economic\r\ngrowth. But I ask the question: has globalization helped\r\neradicate poverty in the marginalized subregions of the\r\nworld, or eliminated social and economic inequities even in\r\nthe developed world? We cannot deny that uncontrolled\r\nmarket forces and unfettered short-term capital flows, to\r\ntake but a few examples of globalization, have had\r\ndevastating consequences on our economies, social\r\ncohesion, political stability and cultural identity — in\r\nmany cases for the worse rather than for the better.\r\nThe events of the recent financial crisis in Asia have\r\nbrought us face-to-face with the worst consequences of\r\nglobalization. Millions of adults were unemployed and a\r\nlarge number of children were forced to leave school.\r\nBut, if anything, the crisis has made us even more\r\ndetermined to meet this challenge, which, though\r\nprimarily financial in nature, has had immense social\r\nconsequences. We have learned that the multifaceted\r\nnature of the challenge of globalization requires a\r\nmultifaceted response.\r\nIn our case, besides the traditional economic reforms\r\nand adjustments undertaken, we also sought to focus our\r\nefforts on addressing the short-term and long-term threats\r\nto the viability and welfare both of individuals and of our\r\nsociety. We therefore give strong priority to promoting\r\nthe establishment of adequate social safety nets and the\r\ndevelopment of human resources. This strategy puts\r\npeople at the centre of our national efforts to bring about\r\nour economic revival. I can proudly say that our efforts\r\nhave finally borne fruit. We have emerged from the crisis\r\nmore competitive, more resilient and better prepared,\r\neconomically and socially.\r\nAt the global level, I firmly believe that to meet the\r\nchallenges of globalization and take the most advantages\r\nfrom its benefits, we must join hands to promote\r\nglobalization with a human face. This is not a new idea.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has spoken of it. The\r\nUnited Nations, particularly the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, has long been a proponent of\r\nthis concept. Unfortunately, when it was introduced some\r\nyears ago, it was still considered an idea far beyond its\r\ntime. If we still find such a concept revolutionary, we are\r\nindeed behind the times.\r\nWe need to ensure that globalization leads us to,\r\namong other things, greater equity among peoples and\r\nnations; the easing of social tensions and the\r\nstrengthening of communities; the inclusion of a greater\r\nnumber of economies as stakeholders and co-partners in\r\nthe building of the global economy; declining poverty and\r\nthe reduction of the income gap between the very rich\r\nand the very poor; enhanced protection and preservation\r\nof our environment; greater protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms; and, perhaps\r\nmost importantly and very simply, a better life for all\r\npeoples.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nThe holding of the tenth session of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development — UNCTAD X —\r\nin Thailand in February 2000 will be an important, defining\r\nmoment in our quest to promote globalization with a human\r\nface. We will consider all these challenges together. We\r\nhope to be able to tame the tsunami of globalization and\r\nturn it into a benevolent force of reconstruction and\r\nequitable distribution of wealth and opportunities, and not\r\nthe menacing force of destruction and destabilization it has\r\nthus far been.\r\nI am pleased to report that our preparations for\r\nUNCTAD X are going well. I wish to take this opportunity\r\nto convey the Thai Government\u0027s assurance to all of you in\r\nthe Assembly that Bangkok will be fully prepared for\r\nUNCTAD X in February 2000. Thailand, as the host\r\ncountry, strongly encourages all Member States to consider\r\nsending to Bangkok delegations at the highest level\r\npossible.\r\nJoining hands to promote globalization with a human\r\nface is a distinct contribution to promoting human security.\r\nThe United Nations is already playing a leadership role in\r\nrealizing this goal at the global level. But the United\r\nNations cannot do it alone. It needs to forge a partnership\r\nwith the non-governmental sector, especially the private\r\nsector and civil society, and with other international\r\norganizations. In a sense, our endeavour to define and,\r\nindeed, to promote human security has philosophical and\r\npractical implications — both positive and negative — for\r\nus as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the\r\nleading global multilateral Organization. We are embarking\r\non an effort to define what the key role of the United\r\nNations will be in the next millennium. I urge all of us to\r\ncontribute to this important mission together.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso, His Excellency\r\nYoussouf Ouedraogo.\r\nMr. Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):\r\nYour brilliant election, Mr. President, to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at this session pays tribute to your\r\npersonal merits and your eminent qualities as a diplomat,\r\nand to your country, Namibia, a country that is to us a\r\nsymbol of the struggle against oppression. First of all, allow\r\nme to address our most sincere and warm congratulations\r\nto you. Your country and Burkina Faso share the same\r\nideals and values, and a similar vision of the future of\r\nAfrica and the world. Suffice it to say that we extend to\r\nyou in advance our willingness and cooperation for the\r\nsuccess of your mission.\r\nWe must also pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr.\r\nDidier Opertti, who so brilliantly discharged his important\r\nresponsibilities during this particularly trying year. I pay\r\ntribute as well to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nwhose work at the helm of the United Nations deserves\r\nour appreciation and our fullest support.\r\nFinally, I would like to congratulate the three new\r\nMembers that have joined the great family of the United\r\nNations — Tonga, Nauru and Kiribati.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly — the last of\r\nthe century — is beginning at a time when recurring and\r\npersistent inter-State and inter-ethnic conflict and hostility\r\nare characteristic of the international scene.\r\nThe globalization of the international economy and\r\nthe liberalization of world trade appear to have worsened\r\nthe economic and social differences between peoples. The\r\nlofty objectives of our Organization — the promotion of\r\npeace, security, justice and equality — seem to be\r\nreceding into the distance.\r\nWe are faced with increasing challenges, which is\r\nmaking the task of the United Nations more difficult. And\r\nyet we sense that the coming millennium will be a time\r\nof growth for our peoples, in particular those of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe waning century threw down every possible\r\nchallenge, but it also gave rise to great hopes. It has been\r\none of the most productive as regards legal instruments\r\naimed at enhancing the protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights. Nevertheless, grave dangers emerged during\r\nthis period that came close to jeopardizing humankind\u0027s\r\nvery existence. The memory of the two great wars\r\nremains very much alive.\r\nIt must be underscored that the United Nations —\r\nborn of the general upheaval of the post-war period and\r\ncharged with working towards peace and a genuine\r\ncollective security for our world — has accomplished a\r\ngreat deal, with the assistance of regional or subregional\r\norganizations such as the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU), the Organization of American States, the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations, the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and so on.\r\nBut despite all these efforts, the quest for peace\r\nremains an immense and difficult undertaking. On the\r\ninternational scene, wars, conflicts and confrontations of\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nall stripes continue to rage, wiping out any progress made\r\nin the field of development.\r\nIn the Middle East, the level of tension between the\r\nparties remains very high, even though recent political\r\nchanges have given rise to hopes of a comprehensive\r\nsolution to the Palestinian question, particularly since the\r\nsigning of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum on 4\r\nSeptember last.\r\nIn an international situation so fraught with conflict,\r\nwe can only rejoice at seeing the spectre of war, which had\r\nseemed inevitable, recede from East Timor thanks to the\r\nwisdom and realism of the parties to this painful conflict.\r\nI cannot fail to mention the military intervention of the\r\nNATO countries in Yugoslavia and more specifically in\r\nKosovo, an operation whose legitimacy was supposedly\r\nbased on the right of humanitarian intervention. But my\r\ncountry, Burkina Faso, is among those that believe that\r\nsuch an intervention should take place only on the basis of\r\na clear and precise mandate and under the supervision of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThough the objective of this type of intervention —\r\nprotecting a victimized minority — may seem defensible,\r\nthe manner in which it was carried out is a cause for\r\nconcern because it represents a challenge to the United\r\nNations and to the basic norms of international law.\r\nBurkina Faso is gratified that the United Nations has taken\r\nup its proper role in the resolution of this conflict.\r\nBut Africa is undoubtedly the continent that has\r\nsuffered the most from these crises. Though peace has been\r\nrestored in Guinea-Bissau, and in Sierra Leone the Lomé\r\nAgreement, signed on 7 July 1999 with the active\r\nparticipation of Burkina Faso, has put an end to the gunfire,\r\nwe must continue tirelessly to strive to resolve the situation\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the Horn of\r\nAfrica and in Angola.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a solution\r\ncan be found if security issues, which remain the essential\r\nconcerns of the various States involved in the conflict, are\r\ntaken into consideration. Accordingly, Burkina Faso\r\nconsiders that the Lusaka agreements must be accepted by\r\nall of the parties if indeed they wish to give peace a\r\nchance.\r\nTurning to the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea,\r\nPresident Blaise Compaoré, during his tenure as the head of\r\nthe high-level OAU delegation and in close cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations, made every effort to promote a\r\npeaceful settlement of this conflict, in conformity with the\r\nmandate he was entrusted with at Ouagadougou by the\r\nthirty-fourth Summit of Heads of State or Government, in\r\nJune 1998.\r\nOur efforts led to the acceptance by both parties of\r\nthe Ouagadougou framework agreement, and, at the\r\nthirty-fifth OAU Summit, held in Algiers, of the\r\nmodalities for the implementation of that agreement. We\r\nare convinced that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the\r\ncurrent Chairman of the OAU, to whom we have passed\r\nthe torch, will strive to ensure a successful outcome to\r\nthis delicate situation. In doing so he will enjoy the\r\ncontinuing and vigorous support of the OAU Secretary\r\nGeneral, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, and the cooperation of\r\nthe United Nations and all of the States that have played\r\na very positive and discreet role in finding a pacific\r\nsolution to the conflict between these two brotherly\r\ncountries. To this end, he will require the cooperation of\r\nboth parties and the support of all, particularly the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe fratricidal conflict in Angola has lasted more\r\nthan two decades, despite all of the sanctions and\r\nmeasures taken against Mr. Jonas Savimbi and his\r\nmovement, UNITA. Burkina Faso is convinced that, as in\r\nother cases — particularly in Sierra Leone and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo — it is only through\r\na dialogue between the parties that a just and lasting\r\nsolution can be found.\r\nIt is clear that, because of their increasingly complex\r\nand interrelated nature, the various conflicts I have\r\nmentioned cannot be resolved in a just and lasting way\r\nunless the efforts of all are conjoined. This includes not\r\nonly the parties to the conflict and the international\r\ncommunity — meaning the United Nations — but also\r\nthe regional and subregional organizations.\r\nIn this respect, we noted, throughout our mandate as\r\nChairman of the OAU, the determination and commitment\r\nof this Organization fully to discharge its responsibilities,\r\nas evidenced by the various initiatives it has undertaken.\r\nWe stand convinced that Africa has resolutely\r\nconsidered the serious consequences these multiple\r\nconflicts entail for the economic and human development\r\nof its population. Accordingly, at the thirty-fifth OAU\r\nSummit in Algiers, it took the courageous and historic\r\ndecision of declaring that the year 2000 would be a year\r\nof peace and security throughout the continent.\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nOf course, we know full well that in order for that\r\nobjective to be attained, the support of the international\r\ncommunity is crucial, not only at the political level, where\r\nits backing will be needed for the implementation of our\r\ndecisions and resolutions, but also at the equally important\r\nlevel of logistics and material support, technical assistance\r\nand humanitarian considerations.\r\nBut any peace is fragile that is not backed by genuine\r\ndisarmament. That is why we support all international\r\ninitiatives in this field, in particular the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\r\nMy country has joined in the fight against anti-\r\npersonnel mines by signing and ratifying the relevant\r\nConvention. Burkina Faso is gratified at the growing\r\nsupport of the international community for the initiative of\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States relating\r\nto a moratorium on the production and transfer of light\r\nweapons. Together with other members of the international\r\ncommunity, my country is also participating in\r\npeacekeeping operations, in particular in the United Nations\r\nMission in the Central African Republic.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, it is\r\ndistressing to note that the world economy is still\r\ndominated and controlled by a minority of States that\r\nmanipulate its rules and the way it operates in their own\r\ninterests and to the detriment of the interests of the great\r\nmajority — the countries that make up the South.\r\nWith regard to social development, poverty has\r\ncontinued to increase in developing countries, where about\r\n1.5 billion people — one quarter of the world\u0027s population\r\n— are living on less than $1 per capita per day. Food\r\nsecurity is far from guaranteed in those countries, while in\r\nthe affluent countries food is destroyed on a huge scale in\r\norder to stabilize prices. The scarcity of drinking water\r\nsupplies and medical services condemns a third of humanity\r\nto a life expectancy of no more than 40 years. Illiteracy\r\ngreatly limits the access of the poorest to knowledge and,\r\nby extension, to information about how their countries are\r\nrun. The most disadvantaged and vulnerable strata —\r\nwomen, children and elderly people — do not fully enjoy\r\nthe benefits of a legal protection system.\r\nAt a more general level, there are unacceptable\r\ndisparities in international economic relations between the\r\nindustrialized and the developing countries. The latter are\r\nbecoming increasingly vulnerable because of the chronic\r\nstructural imbalance in trade with the developed countries.\r\nDespite the decisions taken by the ministerial conferences\r\nof the World Trade Organization, the integration of the\r\nless advanced countries into the multilateral trading\r\nsystem is still an issue, particularly with regard to the\r\nspecial and differentiated treatment that should be granted\r\nto those countries. The greatest challenge in the twenty-\r\nfirst century will undoubtedly be the struggle against the\r\nmarginalization of the countries of the South.\r\nThe burden of debt remains a constant concern, too,\r\ndespite the initiative of the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative and the important decisions\r\ntaken by the Group of Seven Summit in Cologne, which\r\nI welcome.\r\nIn order to promote the genuine and lasting human\r\ndevelopment to which all developing countries aspire, we\r\nmust work for greater justice and equity in international\r\ntrade, through the implementation of various measures,\r\nincluding price stabilization and export guarantees for the\r\nproducts of developing countries through the revaluation\r\nof raw materials and the stabilization of export earnings;\r\nindex-linking of the prices of raw materials to those of\r\nindustrial products; free access for the products the South\r\nto northern markets through the elimination of\r\nprotectionist measures; reform of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions to bring them into line with the needs and\r\npreoccupations of the developing countries; and the\r\npromotion of a genuine North-South dialogue. In this\r\nrespect, Burkina Faso welcomes with interest and\r\nsatisfaction the European initiative to hold an economic\r\nsummit next year for the European Union countries and\r\ntheir African partners.\r\nAs everyone knows, we can make many plans, have\r\nmany ambitious dreams and imagine all sorts of\r\ntransformations for our world. But if we do not place\r\njustice, equity and solidarity at the heart of all our\r\nprojects, they will remain fantasies. Justice demands, for\r\nexample, that we not starve a population through the use\r\nof international sanctions in order to punish its\r\nGovernment. Since I am touching upon that subject, I\r\nwould like to reaffirm our full solidarity with the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, and I hope that, as a result of the\r\nconcessions made by that country with regard to the\r\nLockerbie affair, the unfair sanctions against the brotherly\r\nLibyan people will be lifted for good. Since the historic\r\ndecision at Ouagadougou, this requirement has become\r\nimperative, in our view.\r\nIn this context, the issue of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan also deserves attention. In the interests of equity\r\nand of the principle of universality, Burkina Faso believes\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nthat it is unfair virtually to ostracize 22 million Chinese\r\npeople. That is why we firmly support the initiative to\r\ncreate a study group to examine the particular and\r\nexceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nso as to determine how that entity could be represented in\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIn that connection, in the interests of justice within\r\ninternational relations, we must restructure the Organization\r\nso that we can better respond to the demands of our time\r\nand the expectations of humanity. If the United Nations is\r\nto be more democratic and more just, such reform must go\r\nto the heart of its main body, the Security Council, whose\r\ncomposition and operating methods must be reviewed and\r\ncorrected. The operational capacities of the Organization —\r\nthe structures and activities linked to the promotion of\r\neconomic and social development — must also be\r\nstrengthened.\r\nBurkina Faso believes the human being to be the\r\nsupreme measure of all things. That is why human rights\r\nand the dignity of humankind are at the centre of our\r\nconcerns. In fact, since 1991, my country has been\r\nsteadfastly undertaking an irreversible process of\r\ndemocratization that has led to several rounds of municipal,\r\nlegislative and presidential elections under conditions\r\nrecognized by international observers as being calm and\r\nunbiased. The process is being consolidated and the culture\r\nof democracy and citizenship in a republican system is well\r\nunder way. The stability and security of our country in the\r\ncurrent turbulent environment bear witness to that fact.\r\nWe believe that no price can be placed on democracy\r\nand freedom. That is why we will spare no effort to\r\nstrengthen and extend those values. Burkina Faso intends to\r\nmake a modest contribution to building a more human\r\nworld of greater justice and solidarity, because we are\r\nconvinced that the new international order to which we all\r\naspire requires that political, economic and social forces\r\nthroughout the world join hands and become catalysts of\r\nprogress for the benefit of humanity.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Vice-Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Louis Michel.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): I should\r\nlike first of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and to thank you for\r\nhaving accepted the weighty task that you will be carrying\r\nout during this session. We also wish to express our best\r\nwishes to your country, Namibia, which you so ably\r\nrepresent. We also pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr.\r\nOpertti, for the manner in which he guided our work\r\nduring the previous session.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend\r\nmy sincere congratulations to the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on their\r\nadmission to our Organization.\r\nMy statement is in line with the statement made here\r\nby the Presidency of the European Union. I wish merely\r\nto highlight some of the issues that are particularly\r\nimportant for us.\r\nEarly in the month of August, two young African\r\nchildren, Yaguine and Fodé, were found dead, stowed\r\naway in the landing gear of a Sabena aeroplane, victims\r\nof an idealism and an innocence that led them to embark\r\non a reckless voyage in search of the mirages of western\r\nsociety.\r\nYaguine and Fodé left us a moving message, of\r\nwhich I would like to quote some passages here:\r\n“To the people in charge in Europe: it is to\r\nyour solidarity and to your kindness that we make\r\nan appeal for help for Africa ... We are suffering\r\nenormously ... We have war, disease ... We have\r\nschools, but in order to get a good education and\r\ngood teaching, one needs large amounts of money;\r\nand our parents are poor.\r\n“So, we Africans, especially African children\r\nand young people, ask you to create a great and\r\neffective organization for Africa ... We need you to\r\nfight poverty”.\r\nThe great organization of which Yaguine and Fodé\r\ndreamed is here before me in its most universal form. It\r\nwas conceived from the outset for the maintenance of\r\npeace and for economic and social development. The\r\nauthors of the Charter regarded those two aspects as\r\ninseparable. Over the last decade, this great Organization\r\nhas succeeded in laying a worldwide foundation for\r\neconomic and social values aimed at creating a more\r\ncivilized world, a world in which globalization has\r\ngradually come to the fore.\r\nHere I am thinking of the discrete but tenacious\r\nwork at the great United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits to find new directions for development. That\r\nsignificant work must be continued and consolidated. The\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nuniversal commitments made at Jomtien for education, at\r\nRio de Janeiro for the environment, at Vienna for human\r\nrights, at Copenhagen for social development, at Cairo for\r\npopulation and development, at Beijing for women, at\r\nRome for hunger and at Istanbul for human settlements\r\nconstitute irreversible gains for mankind. It is gratifying\r\nthat the concerns debated and the conclusions adopted at\r\nthose conferences have increasingly become the inspiration\r\nfor our national policies and are helping to bring about the\r\nindispensable convergence among those policies.\r\nBut the tragedy of Yaguine and Fodé brings us face to\r\nface with the harsh reality of unbalanced development. As\r\nI speak, 1.3 billion women and men are surviving — or\r\ntrying to survive — on less than one dollar per day; 840\r\nmillion of them, including 160 million children, suffer daily\r\nfrom hunger or malnutrition. Even more serious, as those\r\ntwo teenagers remind us, 260 million children have no\r\naccess to primary or secondary school because of a lack of\r\nmeans. Every day, 250 million children go to work instead\r\nof to school. At the dawn of the third millennium, it is\r\nincreasingly difficult for our civilization to tolerate such\r\nsocial and human marginalization and such a lack of\r\nsolidarity, in particular for our children.\r\nWe must forge stronger solidarity within the United\r\nNations. We must restore humanism to its rightful place in\r\ninternational relations. For this fight against poverty and\r\nthis campaign for emancipation to succeed, we must agree\r\nto a decisive review of the mechanism that underlies the\r\neconomic fluctuation, that causes financial tension and its\r\nattendant social consequences, and that tolerates massive\r\nexploitation of the weakest by forces that are often\r\nimpersonal and unidentifiable.\r\nHence, we are deeply convinced that we must restore\r\nthe primacy of political leadership in our globalized society.\r\nWe must endeavour without hidden agendas to organize a\r\nnew world political order. We need stronger and more\r\ncoherent United Nations action for economic and social\r\ndevelopment, which requires the use of all available global\r\ntools for economic, financial and commercial governance.\r\nThis means we must be more determined to restoring the\r\nprimacy of policy and no longer to permit democratic\r\nlegitimacy to be circumvented or even flouted by selfish or\r\nspeculative interests. The rights of peoples must always\r\nprevail over the power of money.\r\nBelgium will support United Nations efforts to restore\r\nthe Organization\u0027s mission to protect against the\r\nunacceptable side-effects of globalization. In that spirit, my\r\ncountry attaches great importance to the success of the\r\ncoming Millennium Assembly. In that context, Belgium\r\nis pleased that it will serve as host to the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in\r\nthe spring of 2001, which will bring together in Brussels\r\nall development partners. We hope that this major event\r\nwill lead to a renewed commitment to the integration of\r\nthese countries in the world economy on the basis of\r\nconcrete and quantifiable objectives. The Belgian\r\nGovernment, which recently came into office, has clearly\r\nexpressed its political will gradually to increase our\r\nfunding of bilateral partnerships and cooperation. We\r\nshall pay particular attention to the quality and the\r\ncoherent implementation of the projects we sponsor.\r\nI express the wish that this Assembly session be\r\nconducted under the banner of Africa. Your stimulating\r\nopening statement, Mr. President, and the addresses by\r\nPresident Mbeki of South Africa and by President\r\nBouteflika of Algeria, sent a strong message in that\r\nregard. We Belgians have a traditional interest in the\r\npolitical, economic and development prospects of Central\r\nAfrica. Belgium must reestablish the bonds with that\r\nregion which history and experience have bestowed upon\r\nit. This also implies responsibilities which my\r\nGovernment will endeavour to shoulder in a responsible\r\nand coherent manner. I am thinking in particular of the\r\ntwofold task of the United Nations as an organization\r\nboth for the maintenance of peace and for the promotion\r\nof development. I also have in mind human rights issues,\r\nof which my Government is particularly aware.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the new Belgian Government\r\nhas placed cooperation with Central Africa at the top of\r\nits agenda. To us, it is important that peace and stability\r\nshould return to Central Africa. The Lusaka Ceasefire\r\nAgreement offers hope. It requires the political will of the\r\nvarious parties concerned to address the root causes of the\r\npresent conflict and to seek solutions at a regional level.\r\nA significant effort by the international community will\r\nbe necessary to encourage and support them. My country\r\nwill do its share, and will intensify its direct contacts and\r\nits financial support. Belgium has responded to the appeal\r\nof the Security Council by placing liaison officers at the\r\ndisposal of the Secretary-General. They will be deployed\r\nin accordance with Security Council resolution 1258\r\n(1999) of 6 August 1999.\r\nIt goes without saying that we fully respect the wish\r\nof African leaders that they should find their own political\r\nsolutions to the conflicts that undermine the continent.\r\nBut this can imply no ambiguity about the roles of the\r\nSecurity Council and of the General Assembly. Nor does\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nit mean that the rest of the world should refrain from\r\naction: achieving peace in the Great Lakes region will\r\nrequire tremendous efforts and resources.\r\nHere we must think about concluding a true\r\npartnership pact with the countries of Central Africa.\r\nInspired by the Stability Pact for the Balkans, this would\r\nform part of a genuine strategy for cooperation among\r\ncountries. With the support of the major financial\r\ninstitutions, such a pact could revitalize the economic\r\nmechanisms of partner countries and reinvigorate their\r\nsocial and democratic development. We believe such s\r\npartnership pact should be based on the voluntary and\r\nmutually respectful cooperation of each African and non-\r\nAfrican signatory country and should in no way be\r\nconstrued as an attempt at neo-colonial domineering of that\r\npart of the world.\r\nOther regions of Africa deserve more attention and\r\neffort on the part of the international community. I think in\r\nparticular of the bloody conflict which has plunged Angola\r\ninto unspeakable humanitarian tragedy. I also think of the\r\nwar between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which must be prevented\r\nfrom extending into Somalia. In Sierra Leone, the efforts of\r\nneighbouring countries, which Belgium and other partners\r\nhave supported, give reason for optimism. We also hope\r\nthat Guinea-Bissau will regain civil peace. But much\r\nremains to be done to improve the situation of the peoples\r\nof southern Sudan and of Somalia.\r\nWhatever the media\u0027s focus, now turned towards other\r\nparts of the world, it is important that we do not forget the\r\nsuffering of men, women and especially children of those\r\ncountries of Africa, who aspire to education, health and\r\ndevelopment. The new international policies, based more on\r\nbalance and on the sharing of prosperity, should be directed\r\ntowards them, too.\r\nI turn briefly to North Africa. The presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union recalled that the Maghreb countries are\r\nexperiencing significant growth. They remain an essential\r\npartner for Europe and for world peace, prosperity and\r\ndevelopment. Economic, social, cultural and political ties\r\nwith the southern Mediterranean basin will have to be\r\nstrengthened in the coming months and years.\r\nI also hope that the international Community will fulfil\r\nits commitment to support the Middle East peace process.\r\nThere, too, it will be a matter of releasing the financial and\r\nhuman resources to ensure the economic, social and\r\ndemocratic development of the various regions and peoples\r\nwho are committed to peace. My country is ready to\r\nrespond to calls for cooperation in this regard.\r\nThere is another region where the United Nations\r\nhas been called upon to play a crucial and difficult role.\r\nThe Kosovo crisis has implications for the security of my\r\ncountry and Europe as a whole. It also obliges us to ask\r\na sensitive question about the limits to the right of the\r\ninternational community to intervene in the internal affairs\r\nof a State.\r\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\r\nintervention has appreciably reinforced the idea that moral\r\nand ethical considerations are in the process of\r\novershadowing the traditional concept of national\r\nsovereignty in international relations. If there is one\r\nlesson for our Organization to learn from the twentieth\r\ncentury, it is that for no State can the massacre of its own\r\npeople be considered an “internal affair”, under any\r\npretext. This legal formalism would ultimately amount to\r\nadmitting that, as the head of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), Bernard\r\nKouchner has said, it would be “legitimate, although not\r\nelegant, to massacre one\u0027s own people”.\r\nYet the Security Council is well-equipped to deal\r\nwith massive violations of human rights. Article 42 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter allows the Council to qualify such\r\nviolations as a threat to international peace and security\r\nand to authorize armed intervention, as it has on several\r\noccasions — for example, in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991; in\r\nSomalia in 1992; in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1994; and\r\nin Liberia and Sierra Leone in 1997.\r\nIf the Security Council could not fully play its role\r\nat the beginning of the Kosovo crisis, this was due less to\r\na divergence of views between States over the essence of\r\nthe problem than because there was a rift between the\r\nadvocates of the right of humanitarian intervention and\r\nthe defenders of the traditional legal system, which\r\nregards national sovereignty as the absolute foundation of\r\ninternational relations. My country deeply regrets that a\r\npotential double veto constituted an insurmountable\r\nobstacle that was inappropriate given the extreme urgency\r\nof the situation. We hope that resorting to force without\r\nthe Council\u0027s approval will not constitute a precedent. The\r\nworld needs an international legal order that prevails over\r\nthe law of the jungle. In this respect, we all hope that\r\nresolution 1244 (1999) signals a return to international\r\nlegality.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nBelgium welcomes the decisive attitude of the Security\r\nCouncil regarding East Timor. We hope for a speedy\r\nrestoration of normality there, with the return of its\r\ninhabitants, reconstruction of the country and the\r\nestablishment of a state of law resulting from the expressed\r\nwill of its people.\r\nHere it is opportune to recall the urgent need for the\r\ninternational community to provide itself with the tools\r\nneeded to prevent and punish barbaric acts. We need a\r\ntribunal charged with prosecuting those responsible for the\r\ngravest crimes affecting the whole international community.\r\nThe adoption in Rome of the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court is an important landmark. I appeal to all\r\nStates to sign and ratify it so that the Court can start to\r\noperate as soon as possible. Belgium\u0027s ratification of the\r\nStatute is imminent. This new tribunal must be endowed\r\nwith the human and material means necessary for the\r\naccomplishment of its mission.\r\nThis leads me to the issue of United Nations reform,\r\nand primarily the reform of the Security Council.\r\nFor six years a Working Group under the guidance of\r\nthe President of the General Assembly has attempted, with\r\nmore or less success, to ascertain which reforms would\r\nmake it possible to re-gild the coat of arms of the Security\r\nCouncil. In spite of the efforts of successive Presidents,\r\nlittle progress has been made. Nevertheless, the scope of\r\nthe issue and possible improvements have been identified.\r\nI believe that new momentum can come only from a new\r\ndetermination on the part of our Governments.\r\nIn the view of my country, the Security Council is an\r\nanachronistic reflection of the world of 1946. In 53 years\r\nthe number of independent countries has grown fourfold,\r\nand new great Powers can, whether on economic,\r\ndemographic or geopolitical grounds, legitimately claim a\r\nlarger share of international responsibility.\r\nThe reasons for reform are evident. Lack of it,\r\ncontinuance of the status quo and opposition to change\r\ninvolve the following dangers.\r\nCountries which are legitimate candidates for a\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council, frustrated in their\r\nambitions, will be less inclined to contribute to the\r\ncollective effort to maintain peace, prevent conflict and give\r\nmultilateral development aid. Equally, other countries,\r\nunable to justifiably claim a permanent seat, will be\r\ndeprived of participation in shouldering global\r\nresponsibilities, because of their number and the lack of\r\nobjective rotation criteria. That will bring about a loss of\r\nrepresentativeness and legitimacy, and ultimately of the\r\nCouncil\u0027s authority.\r\nMy country chairs a group of 10 Member States\r\nseeking a solution that can command the broadest\r\npossible support. In spite of the obstacles, we intend to\r\npersevere.\r\nThe reforms that we are considering are not limited\r\nto the Security Council; they also aim at rendering the\r\nmachinery of the United Nations more effective and\r\nefficient. I pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\r\nwho has thrown himself into the task with great\r\ndetermination.\r\nThe United Nations continues to be an indispensable\r\nOrganization. It must be strengthened so that it can carry\r\nout the tasks and responsibilities given it by the Charter.\r\nReform is therefore essential to strengthen the\r\nmechanisms for the solidarity and harmonious\r\ndevelopment to which we all aspire.\r\nThis reform must be accompanied by a sound\r\nfinancial outlook. There has been no improvement over\r\nthe last 12 months; this situation must be redressed.\r\nBelgium, like the many other States which pay their\r\ncontributions on time and unconditionally, calls for all\r\nMember States to do the same. It will be understood, of\r\ncourse, that here I am looking particularly towards\r\nWashington. Belgium, a friend and ally of the United\r\nStates, reaffirms that it is essential that that country play\r\nits role in the United Nations. We all need the United\r\nStates, but it must shoulder its responsibilities, including\r\nits financial responsibilities, within our Organization.\r\nSo far I have mostly spoken of what is not working.\r\nBut there are many areas where progress, even\r\nconsiderable progress, is being made. The Organization\r\nhas played a considerable role in giving an ethical\r\ndimension to the criteria governing international relations.\r\nMy country welcomes this. As the first victim of\r\nchemical weapons — gas used on the battlefields of the\r\nYser — Belgium was a passionate advocate of the\r\nprocess that led to the conclusion and the implementation\r\nof the Chemical Weapons Convention. Similarly, we are\r\nsupporting the efforts to combat biological and\r\nbacteriological weapons and the fight to abolish anti-\r\npersonnel mines. We are also presently engaged in efforts\r\nto reduce the spread of small arms.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nThe anarchistic accumulation of small arms and the\r\nscourge of anti-personnel mines remain among the most\r\nacute problems at this close of the century. These weapons\r\nexacerbate conflicts and are instruments of death and terror,\r\nin Africa as well as in Asia, Latin America and the\r\nBalkans. Nor do the societies of Western Europe and North\r\nAmerica escape this cancer, the full extent of which has yet\r\nto be felt.\r\nSeveral initiatives have been taken to tackle these\r\nproblems, and my country was fully involved in them. By\r\nway of example I would like to mention the Brussels\r\nconference of October 1998 and the Code of Conduct and\r\nthe common action of the European Union, as well as our\r\nparticipation in and financial support for the expert groups\r\nset up by the Secretary-General.\r\nWe will continue our policy of prevention and\r\nreduction with regard to accumulations of small arms, as\r\nwell as our fight for the abolition of anti-personnel mines.\r\nIn general, in the appropriate forums we will continue\r\nto take initiatives to promote arms control and disarmament.\r\nI am thinking, for example, of the reinforcement of the\r\nBiological Weapons Convention, limitations on arms-\r\ntrafficking, the intensification of the fight against the\r\nviolation of embargoes on weapons transfers and the fight\r\nagainst the increase of nuclear arsenals.\r\nFrom economic and social development to\r\ndisarmament or humanitarian intervention, there is a central\r\ntheme that underlies all our actions: human rights. It has\r\nbecome clearer and clearer in the past few years that human\r\nrights are intertwined with the promotion of international\r\npeace and security, economic prosperity, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and social justice.\r\nIn all the reforms of the activities and the structures of\r\nthe United Nations that have been carried out with the\r\nimpetus of the Secretary-General, the promotion of human\r\nrights is a cross-cutting theme involving all the\r\norganizations and agencies that operate on a global scale.\r\nBelgium supports this global and integrated approach\r\nwithout reservations; but the task is immense. Thus, it is in\r\nthe interest of the United Nations to ensure the\r\ncollaboration of regional organizations, whose competencies\r\nand potential in this field can help in the achievement of\r\nthese common objectives.\r\nThe inaugural address of the new Belgian Government\r\nunequivocally put human rights at the top of its agenda and\r\nannounced its intention of pursuing an active policy\r\nwithin all the relevant international organizations.\r\nI would like to pay particular homage to our\r\nSecretary-General, whose patience and tact have often\r\nmade the difference in extremely difficult circumstances.\r\nMy Government remains a steadfast supporter of all his\r\ninitiatives to prepare our Organization for the challenges,\r\nknown and unknown, that lie ahead in the next century.\r\nThrough the Secretary-General I would like to pay\r\nspecial tribute to the United Nations personnel, and\r\nparticularly to all those who died on the field of honour\r\nin humanitarian or peacekeeping missions. Every year the\r\nlist of victims gets longer. My country appeals to the\r\nglobal conscience to respect United Nations personnel and\r\nto ensure that crimes against them do not go unpunished.\r\nIn conclusion, I sincerely hope that the actions of the\r\nSecretary-General will make our Organization more\r\ncredible and more effective, for the United Nations\r\nremains the indispensable universal instrument to achieve\r\nour common goals. It is a beacon in an increasingly\r\ninterdependent world, a source of hope for the Yaguines\r\nand Fodés of all the continents.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Chile, His Excellency Mr. Juan\r\nGabriel Valdés.\r\nMr. Valdés (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I would like\r\nfirst of all to express to you, Sir, our warm\r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We join the\r\nearlier delegations in wishing you success in the\r\nimportant task of guiding our debates.\r\nI would like to express to your predecessor, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Eastern Republic of\r\nUruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, our gratitude for his\r\noutstanding leadership as President of the Assembly at its\r\nfifty-third session.\r\nI also wish to convey very special greetings to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to express our\r\ndeep appreciation for the work that he has done and our\r\nfirm support for his efforts to achieve peace in a year that\r\nhas been of critical importance for the United Nations.\r\nChile extends a hearty welcome to the new Member\r\nStates of our Organization, Kiribati, Nauru and the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nKingdom of Tonga, fraternal countries of the Pacific\r\ncommunity.\r\nGlobalization and interdependence require new and\r\nstronger international institutions. As the international\r\nenvironment becomes increasingly complex and difficult,\r\nthe United Nations, with all its limitations, remains the only\r\nglobal actor capable of addressing not only the problems of\r\ncooperation and global conflict, but also issues that, by their\r\nvery nature, are no longer within the exclusive competence\r\nof States.\r\nThe expansion of the international agenda and the\r\nneed for collective management of the problems of\r\ninterdependence are the impetus for this trend. The issue of\r\ndemocracy, or rather of the lack of democracy, has ceased\r\nto be exclusively a sovereign matter for countries to deal\r\nwith; it has become a universal concern that no Government\r\ncan ignore. Protection of the environment has an\r\nindisputable international dimension, inasmuch as issues of\r\nvital importance for our future, such as climate change, the\r\npollution and over-exploitation of the oceans, the\r\ndeterioration of the ozone layer and growing desertification,\r\nall require global remedies. Increasingly strict international\r\nregimes are being established for the regulation and\r\nprohibition of weapons of mass destruction and for the\r\nelimination of anti-personnel landmines. The fight against\r\ndrug-trafficking can be truly effective only if it is waged\r\nwithin a framework of close regional and international\r\ncooperation, based on the principle of shared responsibility.\r\nSuch moving issues as the treatment of refugees, the fight\r\nagainst hunger and major epidemics fall squarely within the\r\nscope of multilateral action. The Government of Chile\r\nenthusiastically supports this trend towards a new\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nThe crisis in Kosovo revealed one of the most serious\r\nweaknesses and contradictions of the United Nations. The\r\npolicies of ethnic cleansing supported by the Serbian\r\nleadership in that region required an immediate and\r\nvigorous response by the international community.\r\nIt was truly regrettable that our Organization was\r\nprevented from the outset from taking action with the\r\nvigour that the situation required. It was also regrettable\r\nthat the solution to the crisis was found outside the\r\nappropriate framework of United Nations mechanisms and\r\nin contravention of the principles of the Charter. There is\r\nclearly a responsibility shared by all the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council for the inadequate\r\nfunctioning of the mechanisms of collective security. Once\r\nagain, it was evident that the veto or the threat of its use\r\ncan reduce to impotence the world\u0027s principal organ of\r\ncollective security. Once again, it was evident that, when\r\nthis occurs, a vacuum is created that can lead to the\r\nunilateral use of force without the prior authorization of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nMore recently, the United Nations has had to face a\r\nnew challenge, a fresh humanitarian tragedy that it had to\r\nstop at all costs. I refer to the crisis in East Timor. Chile\r\nsupported with hope and enthusiasm the holding of the\r\nreferendum on 30 August, which was made possible by\r\nthe significant agreement reached between Indonesia and\r\nPortugal under United Nations auspices.\r\nA Chilean delegation of two distinguished\r\nparliamentarians was able to observe the successful\r\norganization of the electoral process and the admirable\r\nwork of the United Nations volunteers and staff. They\r\nalso witnessed the onset of the incidents that culminated\r\nin the massacre of which we are all aware. These acts are\r\ntotally unacceptable. We are pleased that the Republic of\r\nIndonesia has requested the intervention of the United\r\nNations to put an end to violence on the island. We are\r\nencouraged by the fact that, after so many unnecessary\r\ndeaths, it has been possible to organize a multinational\r\nforce under the efficient leadership of Australia.\r\nI wish to reiterate and reaffirm the commitment of\r\nChile to the peacekeeping operations of the United\r\nNations. Without interruption since 1949, my country has\r\nlent its cooperation to several of these operations. Today,\r\nwe are expanding our participation in this field and have\r\ndecided to contribute to the peacekeeping forces deployed\r\nin Kosovo and in East Timor. In February, Chile formally\r\njoined the reserve forces system. We have already\r\nidentified the personnel to be kept at the ready in terms\r\nof military units, police monitors and civilian experts.\r\nI wish to stress the importance that we attach to the\r\nimplementation of the Ottawa Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, which Chile has signed and for which it is\r\ncompleting the formalities required for its approval by our\r\nNational Congress. In keeping with the spirit and purpose\r\nof that instrument, I reiterate my country\u0027s commitment\r\nnot to produce, export, import or lay any new anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, as we demonstrated last April in our\r\nofficial declaration of a unilateral moratorium.\r\nMy country notes with optimism and hope the\r\npositive signs that have recently emerged with regard to\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nthe long-awaited resumption of the peace process between\r\nIsrael and the Palestinian people. Chile has resolutely\r\nsupported this process from the very beginning and noted\r\nwith great concern its virtual paralysis. We hope that the\r\nIsraelis and the Palestinians alike will have the courage and\r\nresolve to opt unambiguously for dialogue and peace.\r\nChile expresses its concern and frustration at the\r\nobstacles that continue to block the self-determination\r\nreferendum provided for under the United Nations\r\nSettlement Plan for Western Sahara. We hope that the date\r\nthat has been set will be honoured so that the Sahraoui\r\npeople can have the opportunity to express their preference\r\nin a free, informed and transparent manner.\r\nLatin America has continued to make significant\r\ncontributions to international peace and stability throughout\r\nthe year. A final settlement has been achieved in the border\r\nconflict between two fraternal peoples on our continent:\r\nEcuador and Peru. As one of the four guarantor countries\r\nof the 1941 treaty by which those two countries are bound,\r\nChile is pleased to have contributed to the rapprochement\r\nbetween the parties and to have facilitated the dialogue that\r\nled this year to the settlement of their differences and the\r\nsigning of a peace agreement.\r\nThe border between Argentina and Chile is one of the\r\nlongest in the world. Numerous disagreements have arisen\r\nin the past over its demarcation. Thanks to the political will\r\nof the two nations, it has been possible to find solutions to\r\neach one of these problems. I have the deep satisfaction of\r\nannouncing to this Assembly that we have reached a\r\nsettlement with Argentina on the last remaining border\r\ndispute between our peoples. Our Parliaments have adopted\r\nthe Campo de Hielo Sur agreement and we can now\r\nconcentrate without distraction on the task of developing a\r\nrelationship of peace, friendship and cooperation and a true\r\nstrategic alliance between our two countries.\r\nFour years have passed since, on the occasion of the\r\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations, the Member States undertook to intensify efforts\r\nto reform and democratize the Organization\u0027s structures in\r\norder to equip it to deal with the new and complex\r\nchallenges that it faces in a constantly changing\r\ninternational environment. We must acknowledge, however,\r\nthat little progress has been made. It has become a truism\r\nto point to the changes that have occurred in the\r\ninternational system set up after the Second World War.\r\nLess frequently mentioned is the fact that the institutions\r\nhave not kept pace with these changes.\r\nChile has stressed the need for due importance to be\r\ngiven to the process of reforming the General Assembly\r\nas the prime deliberative and decision-making body of the\r\nentire system. It is only here that all Member States are\r\nrepresented on an equal footing.\r\nOn this occasion, we reaffirm our position that the\r\nreform of the Security Council must take into account\r\nsuch criteria and principles as the sovereign equality of\r\nStates, equitable geographic representation and the need\r\nto create conditions for a functioning that would\r\nguarantee greater transparency and democracy in the\r\nworking methods and procedures of that body. The\r\npersistence of the veto — which, moreover, can be\r\nexercised without any public justification — represents a\r\nserious obstacle to the achievement of substantive\r\nagreements. It is a fact that most of the obstacles to the\r\nadmission of new permanent members are directly related\r\nto the right of veto that accompanies such membership.\r\nClearly, the loosening of regulations that govern the\r\nfree circulation across borders of the knowledge, goods\r\nand capital that are characteristic elements of\r\nglobalization has entailed significant benefits for our\r\nsocieties. It is also true, however, that globalization has\r\nthrown up new challenges and, in some cases, new risks,\r\nparticularly those associated with capital movement.\r\nThe international financial crisis of recent years has\r\ndemonstrated our ongoing vulnerability to events that we\r\ncannot control and for which we are not entirely\r\nresponsible. Following the near collapse of the\r\ninternational financial system, the demand for structural\r\nreform has increased exponentially. Today, while the\r\nsituation appears more hopeful, nothing has changed in\r\nsubstance. The systemic risks remain. We must relaunch,\r\nwith fresh impetus and vigour, the necessary reform\r\nprocess to stabilize the international financial system in\r\nthe future.\r\nCapital flows far exceed the value of world trade. It\r\nis ironic that, while we have devoted so much effort to\r\nestablishing new trade regimes throughout the world, so\r\nlittle has been done in the field of international finance.\r\nThe point is certainly not to impede the international flow\r\nof capital, but to establish an appropriate international\r\nframework to address the problems to which it may give\r\nrise. We cannot continue to be passive spectators as\r\nfinancial crises interrupt world growth and limit the\r\ndevelopment of our countries.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nIt is also essential that we put all our energies into the\r\nnew round of multilateral trade negotiations that is just\r\nbeginning. The multilateral trade system, reflected most\r\naccurately in the World Trade Organization, must be\r\nstrengthened with a view to ensuring sustained and\r\ngenuinely equitable growth for all countries. It is essential\r\nthat the new round soon to start in Seattle be balanced so\r\nas to reflect the interests of developed and developing\r\ncountries alike. We also hope that it will be comprehensive\r\nin its thematic coverage. We oppose a limited approach in\r\nthe form of sectoral trade negotiations.\r\nIn the framework of the agendas of United Nations\r\nsummits and conferences, the closing decade has witnessed\r\ngatherings at the highest level to consider the urgent social\r\nproblems that beset mankind. From Copenhagen to Rio de\r\nJaneiro, Beijing to Cairo, Vienna to New York, the United\r\nNations has accomplished a superlative task in reviewing\r\nproblems and adopting programmes of action in the most\r\nimportant social spheres. In this connection, we attach the\r\ngreatest importance to the follow-up and implementation of\r\nagreements emanating from the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment. A special session of the General Assembly,\r\nto be held in Geneva next June, should renew the\r\ninternational community\u0027s commitment to the process begun\r\nin Copenhagen.\r\nWe welcome the recent Convention of the\r\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) on the prohibition\r\nof the most severe forms of child labour. We are confident\r\nthat that organization, under the leadership of our fellow\r\nChilean, Mr. Juan Somavía, will play an increasingly\r\nrelevant role in the new international social agenda.\r\nViolations of the basic rights of individuals can no\r\nlonger be considered an exclusively domestic problem of a\r\ncountry. Protection of these rights is the inescapable task of\r\nthe international community. This has been recognized by\r\nChile, which, since regaining democracy in 1990, has\r\nfirmly and sincerely supported the establishment of\r\neffective universal and regional regimes for the protection\r\nof human rights. We must bear in mind that the\r\ninternational regime for the protection of human rights is\r\nfragmentary and evolving. It consists of a set of standards\r\nand institutions that are gradually beginning to be applied\r\nwith many gaps and imperfections. It should also be noted\r\nthat this regime is being applied within the context of a\r\ncertain international reality characterized by important\r\ndifferences in the relative power of countries and by\r\nselective and sometimes paternalistic practices.\r\nGenocide and massive violations of human rights are\r\ndestined to fall within the competence of international\r\ntribunals. Chile welcomes that tendency, but it also\r\nrecognizes that we are now in a transitional stage of the\r\nprocess of globalization of justice. In this stage the norms\r\nof jurisdictions are not clear and are subject to various\r\ninterpretations, including some that may be arbitrary and\r\nerroneous.\r\nChile regained its democracy almost 10 years ago.\r\nMy Government represents those who fought for nearly\r\ntwo decades to restore Chile\u0027s tradition of freedom. Our\r\neconomy has experienced remarkable growth during this\r\nperiod. We scrupulously respect human rights. We\r\nparticipate avidly in furthering Latin American\r\nintegration. We are adhering to the new regimes being\r\nestablished by the international community in very diverse\r\nspheres.\r\nWe have also faced the dilemma of administering\r\njustice with respect to violations of human rights that\r\noccurred in the past in our country. This choice has led to\r\nconsiderable tension. Many countries that began the\r\nprocess of transition to democracy in more favourable\r\nconditions than Chile\u0027s preferred to circumvent such\r\ntensions by refraining from prosecuting very serious\r\ncrimes that occurred during the previous regimes.\r\nIn these circumstances, what grounds would exist for\r\nthe judiciary of a third State to exercise jurisdiction with\r\nrespect to acts that are currently the subject of\r\nproceedings in the court of the State in which those acts\r\nwere committed? There is no denial of justice in Chile.\r\nWe do not accept impunity for human rights violations.\r\nThe Government has initiated a broad dialogue to deal\r\nwith the consequences of the most serious human rights\r\nviolations that occurred in our country, particularly the\r\ntragedy of those who were arrested and disappeared. At\r\npresent nearly 300 cases relating to human rights\r\nviolations committed during the authoritarian regime that\r\ngoverned our country between 1973 and 1990 are being\r\ntried in Chilean courts. In several cases, the Chilean\r\ncourts have convicted the accused and have sentenced\r\nthem to prison terms that are now being served in\r\npenitentiaries.\r\nWe would understand if the organized international\r\ncommunity attempted to administer justice in countries in\r\nwhich the rule of law did not prevail or where the most\r\nbasic human rights continued to be trampled. But in a\r\ndemocratic State the task of administering justice must be\r\nundertaken by that State and its institutions.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nThe Government of Chile considers it highly\r\nundesirable that judges of other countries should claim\r\njurisdiction to intervene directly in that process. This claim\r\nto jurisdiction, based on the principle of separation of\r\npowers, means plainly and simply ignoring the principle of\r\nthe juridical equality of States. Interference in matters\r\nwithin our country\u0027s jurisdiction is inappropriate and\r\nmisplaced and is tantamount to a lack of respect for our\r\nState of law and our democracy. Today this interference\r\naffects Chile and other fraternal countries of the Southern\r\nCone of Latin America. Tomorrow it may extend to the rest\r\nof the international community, leading to juridical chaos\r\nand competing judicial claims that will end up damaging\r\nthe international relations of many of our countries.\r\nBut our reaction to these imperfections and\r\ndiscriminatory practices is not to seek refuge in outdated\r\nprinciples and notions. On the contrary: we must move\r\nforward towards a clear, orderly and non-discriminatory\r\nregime, such as the one envisaged in the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. The establishment of a\r\npermanent organ designed to exercise criminal jurisdiction\r\nover persons accused of any of the crimes over which it has\r\ncompetence will have the virtue of discouraging both\r\nimproper internal procedures that guarantee the impunity of\r\nthe perpetrators and attempts by judges in other countries\r\nto make themselves the righteous of the world.\r\nI wish to conclude by expressing prudent optimism for\r\nthe future of our Organization. Many States and other\r\nactors, such as non-governmental organizations that make\r\nup our increasingly vibrant international civil society, would\r\nlike to raise the standing of the United Nations. We hope\r\nthat the Millennium Assembly, to which we have given all\r\nour support, will become the symbol of a renewed and\r\nmuch stronger United Nations as it faces the new century.\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Malta, His Excellency The Honourable Joseph\r\nBorg.\r\nMr. Borg (Malta): I join other delegations in\r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly. Your experience and\r\ndiplomatic skills will undoubtedly guide us successfully\r\nthrough the fifty-fourth session. I would also like to express\r\nour gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, who\r\ndisplayed such competence and ability in conducting our\r\nwork during the past year. We would also like to express\r\nour deep sense of satisfaction and gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his incessant\r\ndiplomatic intervention to help resolve conflicts in various\r\nparts of the globe.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to offer our most\r\nsincere congratulations to the three new Members of this\r\nOrganization, the Republic of Nauru, the Kingdom of\r\nTonga and the Republic of Kiribati. I should also add that\r\nMalta already cooperates closely with these three new\r\nMembers through our joint membership of the\r\nCommonwealth.\r\nFor over half a century the United Nations has been\r\ninstrumental in fostering a culture of partnership among\r\nStates. The foundation and survival of a universal\r\nOrganization entrusted with the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the promotion of\r\nsocial justice, freedom and human rights is an\r\nunprecedented achievement in the history of mankind.\r\nUndeniably, great strides have been made by this\r\nOrganization in helping forge swords into ploughshares\r\nthrough enhanced cooperation between its Member States.\r\nWe have striven individually and collectively, painfully at\r\ntimes and imperfectly at others, towards a process of\r\npolitical, social, economic and technological evolution.\r\nGlobalization has become a central concept in the way we\r\nview the world. Interdependence has consequently become\r\nthe norm.\r\nOvershadowing such progress, however, are the\r\narmed conflicts, economic imbalances and social\r\ndislocation that we still face. Events in our days show that\r\ngross violations of human rights and disregard for\r\nhumanitarian principles continue to plague us. The\r\natrocities that human beings are capable of inflicting on\r\none another defy the noble aspirations that inspired the\r\nbirth of our Organization. The irony of such a situation\r\ncannot be lost on anyone. Even less can the tragedy of\r\nsuch a predicament be ignored.\r\nVicious armed conflicts, such as those we have been\r\nwitnessing in parts of Africa and in the Balkans, not to\r\nmention the atrocities recently perpetrated in East Timor,\r\ncontinue to destroy an untold number of lives, disrupting\r\nentire societies, traumatizing tens of thousands of men,\r\nwomen and children and diverting precious resources\r\naway from development.\r\nMr. Ingolfsson (Iceland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe international community cannot afford to be\r\ncomplacent about the humanitarian crises that we are\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nwitnessing today. It is incumbent on each of us to rise to\r\nthe challenge of securing a world free from deprivation,\r\nfear and oppression. Strengthening the United Nations to\r\nbecome better equipped to address contemporary needs and\r\nto meet the challenges of the future thus becomes more\r\nurgent. The role of the United Nations in the promotion of\r\npreventive diplomacy must increasingly assume particular\r\nimportance if, collectively, we are to defuse and resolve\r\npotentially destructive situations.\r\nPeace and security are intimately intertwined with\r\ndevelopment and prosperity. Too often, lack of development\r\nprecipitates conflict. Promoting development helps prevent\r\nwars and acts as a means of creating channels of\r\ncooperation within, as well as among, nations. This was the\r\nessential message emanating from the International\r\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo and\r\nthe Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development. It\r\nwas a commitment to consolidate the partnership of nations,\r\na commitment restated and underscored during the review\r\nconferences held within the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nDemocracy, good governance, respect for human\r\nrights and the rule of law are essential foundations for the\r\nattainment of peace and development and for upholding the\r\ndignity of the human person. Where these are absent, our\r\nefforts to implement post-conflict peace-building,\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction programmes in war-torn\r\nareas must be intensified. The importance of cementing\r\nceasefire agreements with stable political and economic\r\ninstitutions, while simultaneously creating partnerships\r\nbetween Governments and civil society, cannot be\r\nunderestimated.\r\nOne of the main thrusts of the work of the United\r\nNations has been aimed at the equitable and long-lasting\r\nreform of the Security Council, especially given the\r\nexpanded membership of the Organization. It is in the\r\ninterest of all to find a solution to the Council\u0027s reform that\r\nwill ensure its smooth functioning, transparency and\r\nenhanced relevance.\r\nWhile the root causes of conflicts are complex, the\r\nillegal proliferation and trafficking of weapons clearly has\r\na destabilizing effect on society and only serves to prolong\r\nconflicts. Increased global efforts are warranted to monitor\r\nand control the illicit transfer of small arms and light\r\nweapons. The emerging global consensus on the issue is\r\nencouraging. Malta looks forward to the eventual convening\r\nof an international conference on the illicit arms trade in all\r\nits aspects. Addressing this disruptive phenomenon becomes\r\nmore urgent when it is compounded by its complex\r\nlinkages with other equally destabilizing activities, such\r\nas international crime, drug trafficking and terrorism.\r\nResponsibility for the plight of peoples cannot be\r\nshirked by national Governments. Accountability by\r\nindividuals for their actions must be enforced. The\r\ninternational community\u0027s outrage at shocking, massive\r\nviolations of human rights has found expression in the\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court. The adoption\r\nof the Statute last year in Rome constituted an important\r\nmilestone. It is Malta\u0027s hope that it is only a matter of\r\ntime before the Court begins to function.\r\nHeinous crimes against humanity are an affront to\r\nthe intrinsic values of civilization. They cannot be\r\ntolerated. Likewise, the shameless disregard for human\r\nrights that have been enshrined in various international\r\ninstruments cannot go unheeded. Effective protection of\r\nthose rights should not be allowed to fall victim to\r\nexcuses of national sovereignty. This is even more\r\ncompelling given that only last year we commemorated\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\r\nThe international community has made great\r\nheadway in the way it deals with the world\u0027s resources to\r\nsafeguard the heritage of future generations. Since it\r\njoined the Organization 35 years ago, Malta has played an\r\nactive role in this field. It would be remiss of me today\r\nnot to pay tribute to Professor Arvid Pardo, Malta\u0027s first\r\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations, who\r\nsadly passed away recently. His diplomatic skills and\r\njudicious acumen, as well as his vision, were instrumental\r\nin developing the concept of the common heritage of\r\nmankind. This concept, so ably launched by Professor\r\nPardo on behalf of the Malta Government, was the key to\r\nthe process that eventually led to the adoption of the\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nIn a similar vein, during the last session, my\r\ndelegation was active in promoting the idea of a better\r\nand more substantive discussion on oceans through\r\nimproved coordination among the various organs dealing\r\nwith the subject. In this regard, it is our hope that a\r\nworkable solution to this issue will be reached.\r\nMalta\u0027s readiness to play an active and positive role\r\nin the furtherance of international peace and cooperation\r\nhas led to the reactivation of our application for\r\nmembership in the European Union. In September of last\r\nyear, following elections and a change in Government,\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nMalta reactivated its application, which had been frozen for\r\nthe previous two years. The application had been submitted\r\nin 1990, and by the time it was suspended in 1996, Malta\r\nwas widely considered as a prime candidate for early\r\nmembership of the European Union. The 1998 reactivation\r\nwas therefore generally seen, both within and outside Malta,\r\nas a resumption of unfinished business, rather than as a new\r\nbeginning.\r\nThe contractual basis of our present relationship with\r\nthe Union remains the Association Agreement signed in\r\n1970, as subsequently amplified and amended. Until it is\r\nsuperseded by membership, we expect this Agreement to\r\nremain in force and to continue to be complemented by\r\nadditional measures in both traditional and new areas of\r\ncooperation, including the areas of justice and home affairs.\r\nWe see our objective to join the European Union as\r\nthe most appropriate response to Malta\u0027s historical and\r\ncultural heritage, as well as to the economic, social and\r\nsecurity requirements of our national development. The\r\naccession negotiations that we hope to be conducting in the\r\nnear future will be guided by this perception. The outcome\r\nof these negotiations will then be submitted to the\r\njudgement of the Maltese people in a referendum.\r\nSince independence in 1964, Malta has been\r\nsteadfastly committed to the critical role that multilateral\r\ncooperation, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter, is\r\nincreasingly playing in the endeavour towards progress,\r\njustice and stability within and among nations.\r\nOver the years, notwithstanding constraints imposed\r\nby its size and resources, Malta has engaged itself in many\r\nUnited Nations-sponsored initiatives related to the\r\npromotion of human rights, economic and social\r\ndevelopment, disarmament, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes and safeguarding the environment. As members of\r\nthe European Union, we expect to find increased\r\nopportunities, as well as to benefit from an increased\r\ncapacity to pursue these and related objectives at both the\r\nglobal and regional level.\r\nThis certainty springs from our conviction that the\r\nEuropean Union is at the forefront of endeavours to\r\nstrengthen international understanding and cooperation. Its\r\npolicies towards enlargement and regional cooperation, the\r\npromotion of economic and social development, conflict\r\nresolution and peacekeeping provide a constant gauge of its\r\nrelevance in this regard.\r\nMalta views the enlargement of the European Union\r\nnot so much as an option but rather as a fulfilment. Each\r\nenlargement step constitutes fulfilment for the Union\r\nitself, and that contributes to the completion of an\r\nhistorical process that reverses the age-old conflict and\r\nthe fragmentation of the European continent. It is also a\r\nfulfilment for a candidate country like Malta in that\r\nmembership assures it of a continuing role in the political\r\nand economic life of the continent where most of its\r\nhistory and culture were, and continue to be, forged.\r\nThe unfolding of events in Europe over the last\r\ndecade highlights this fundamental dimension of the\r\nUnion\u0027s enlargement process. As they emerged from\r\npolitical suppression and economic stagnation, the Central\r\nand Eastern European States immediately defined their\r\nnational aspirations within the framework of European\r\nintegration. For its part, the European Union recognized\r\nthat the objective of membership for all the Central and\r\nEastern European States was a vital ingredient in\r\nsustaining stability and progress throughout the continent\r\nin the shorter and the longer term. Significantly, in spite\r\nof the complexities involved, there is already a marked\r\nreadiness by the Union to contribute both assistance and\r\nfunds towards reconstruction in the Balkans while\r\nsimultaneously pursuing enlargement through Central and\r\nEastern Europe and with the two Mediterranean\r\nislands — Malta and Cyprus.\r\nCooperation with the neighbouring regions and\r\naround the world is, for the European Union, an\r\nindispensable accompaniment to enlargement. Be it in the\r\ntraditional transatlantic domain, on the still-evolving\r\nEastern border or on its historical southern, Mediterranean\r\nborder, the Union provides a constant and credible\r\nreassurance of the outward-looking dimension embedded\r\nin the European integration process.\r\nStraddling, as it does, both the horizontal and the\r\nvertical axes of the Mediterranean, Malta attaches\r\nparticular importance to the promotion of cooperation in\r\nthis area. It is as much for regional and global\r\ngeostrategic reasons as it is in our own national security\r\ninterests for the Mediterranean to be considered as a\r\nmeeting place, rather than as a dividing line between\r\npeoples and cultures.\r\nOf particular importance to us is the Euro-\r\nMediterranean partnership launched in 1995 by the\r\nEuropean Union in Barcelona. This partnership provides\r\nstrong support for our belief that membership in the\r\nUnion will reinforce Malta\u0027s traditional role in the\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\npromotion of Mediterranean security and cooperation. One\r\nof Malta\u0027s contributions to the Union will be the added\r\ninsight into, and the commitment to, Euro-Mediterranean\r\ncooperation that Malta will bring with it. At the regional\r\nlevel, as much as at the broader international level, Malta\r\nsees its membership in the European Union as an element\r\nof further involvement in the process of multilateral\r\ncooperation for peace and prosperity in the Mediterranean.\r\nMalta has welcomed, and is wholeheartedly involved\r\nin, the Barcelona partnership because of its intrinsic merits\r\nin promoting a concrete and effective programme of\r\ncooperation in the Mediterranean. In this regard, at their\r\nlast meeting in Stuttgart, the foreign ministers of the Euro-\r\nMediterranean partnership agreed to reinforce\r\ncomprehensive stability in the region through the conclusion\r\nof the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and\r\nStability — an initiative in which Malta has been active\r\nfrom the outset and which it is keen to see take shape.\r\nDespite the many challenges faced by the\r\nMediterranean, it is our firm view that lasting solutions may\r\nbe found. We sincerely believe that an early settlement of\r\nthe Cyprus question along the lines of the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions can be achieved.\r\nMalta has been encouraged by the positive overtures\r\nsignalled by the major protagonists in the Middle East\r\npeace process in recent months. What appeared to be for so\r\nlong an intractable problem has been slowly but steadily\r\nunfolding towards the path of reconciliation and peace.\r\nTrue cooperation within the region demands that the spirit\r\nof reconciliation prevail. Recent events — most especially\r\nthe Wye II Agreement — carried forward by all those\r\nworking for peace in the region bode well for continued\r\ndialogue and cooperation between the parties of the region.\r\nIt is in this light that we hail the progress achieved on\r\nthe question of Lockerbie and the resulting suspension of\r\nsanctions on Libya. The satisfaction expressed recently by\r\nboth the Security Council and the European Union General\r\nAffairs Council in respect of positive developments in\r\nLibya also augurs well for the inclusion of Libya in the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean process as soon as it adopts the\r\nBarcelona acquis. We welcome this development.\r\nMay all these efforts lead to widespread cooperation\r\nfor the Mediterranean as a whole, bringing peace and\r\nprosperity for its people in the years to come.\r\nTo many the new millennium is a time of promise and\r\nexpectation, a period of change and transition. Yet, to many\r\nothers — indeed too many — it is a time of difficulty and\r\ntrepidation, of unfulfilled promises. Poised as we are on\r\nthe brink of a new era, it is vital that the United Nations\r\nprevails to safeguard the well-being and prosperity of\r\nfuture generations.\r\nEven our best efforts can be brought to nothing in an\r\ninstant, by the sheer force of nature. The recent\r\ndevastating earthquakes that hit the peoples of Turkey,\r\nGreece and Taiwan have galvanized the international\r\ncommunity. Shocked by the loss of so many lives, the\r\ndisplacement of whole communities and the pain of\r\nthousands, the international response to alleviate the\r\nsuffering was generous and expeditious. It was yet\r\nanother instance where the expression of solidarity\r\ntowards the victims of a natural disaster unveiled the\r\nhuman face of the international community.\r\nThat same spirit also inspires us when challenged by\r\nman-made disasters. It was that same spirit that gave birth\r\nto the United Nations.\r\nWe acknowledge that the United Nations cannot be\r\nthe perfect panacea for the ills of the world. Yet it\r\nremains the unique platform from which to promote and\r\nprotect the inherent rights of all peoples to live in peace,\r\nfreedom and dignity. By focusing on human security in\r\nits manifold dimensions — political, economic and\r\nsocial — the United Nations will continue to be a beacon\r\nof hope to all nations.\r\nThe General Assembly has always shown that it is\r\nfully conscious of the need to invest in the future — an\r\ninvestment that also requires the consolidation of a culture\r\nof peace. This was the essence of the resolutions that\r\nproclaimed the year 2000 as the International Year for the\r\nCulture of Peace and the next decade as the International\r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the\r\nChildren of the World.\r\nIt is our fervent hope that the Millennium Assembly\r\nnext year will generate the necessary political will and\r\nsolidarity to ensure that our efforts on the international\r\nscene bear fruit to safeguard the values on which this\r\nOrganization was founded. We must move the process of\r\nintrospection and deliberation forward to a process of\r\ncommitted implementation and action. Strong political\r\nwill and conviction are needed to fulfil our common\r\ngoals.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 14th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nWe should not aim for short-term remedies, but should\r\nrather pool our collective efforts in order to achieve\r\nlong-lasting solutions to the challenges we face today —\r\nthe eve of a new era.\r\nThis is Malta\u0027s pledge for the new millennium. This\r\nis what we aim to ensure — that our efforts, both at the\r\nnational and international level will be achieved.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n27\r\n"
