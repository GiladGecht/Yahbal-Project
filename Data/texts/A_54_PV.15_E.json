(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Petar Stoyanov, President of the\r\nRepublic of Bulgaria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Bulgaria.\r\nMr. Petar Stoyanov, President of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bulgaria, His Excellency Mr.\r\nPetar Stoyanov, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Stoyanov: May I first congratulate you, Mr.\r\nPresident, on your election to this responsible position. I am\r\nsure that your vast knowledge and experience are a\r\nguarantee of the success of this session.\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to express my most\r\nsincere congratulations also to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, for his contribution to strengthening the role\r\nof the United Nations in line with the challenges of the\r\nmodern world.\r\nI am going to spare the Assembly the review of this\r\nyear\u0027s international developments that it probably\r\nanticipated, because I come from a region that has\r\ngenerated enough bad news and is still the focus of world\r\nattention.\r\nSome of the developments in our region were not\r\nthe result of human will. The earthquakes in Turkey and\r\nGreece, which claimed tens of thousands of victims,\r\nshook the world. Regrettably, man-made disasters have\r\ntaken a high toll on our region. The war in Kosovo, the\r\nfourth in a row in the former Yugoslavia, has left in its\r\nwake a comparable trail of tragedies.\r\nNow that the war is over, there are two things we\r\nmust do: as soon as possible, repair the damage and\r\nalleviate the trauma it has inflicted, and build an\r\ninfrastructure of security and prosperity that precludes any\r\nfuture repetition of such tragic events.\r\nThe international community has in the past set itself\r\nsimilar ambitious tasks. This time, I hope, the experience\r\nit has gained has reached the critical mass needed for the\r\nachievement of lasting peace settlements in conflict areas.\r\nThe consequences of the Kosovo crisis have spilled\r\nover the borders of the region. That is why I find it\r\nworthwhile to share with the Assembly some conclusions\r\nabout what was, hopefully, the last war in the Balkans.\r\nWith the adoption of Security Council resolution\r\n1244 (1999), the world community has endorsed the\r\npolitical end of the system established by the cold war.\r\nThat resolution reflected the new international status quo\r\nand the understanding that has grown during the past 10\r\nyears of the importance of individual security.\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nToday, the rights and dignity of the human individual,\r\ncivil freedoms and the international rule of law override\r\neven the sovereignty of States. This calls for a new\r\nresponsibility on the part of the international community for\r\ntheir protection. The resolution also showed the\r\ncommitment of Security Council members to international\r\nstability.\r\nParadoxical as it may sound, the Kosovo crisis has\r\nserved as a catalyst of post-bipolar relations and of a new\r\ntype of political dialogue among States. Significantly, for\r\nthe first time since the Second World War, four permanent\r\nSecurity Council members are participating in one force —\r\nKFOR. Furthermore, they have been involved in\r\npeacekeeping operations — something that would have\r\nbeen unthinkable 10 years ago.\r\nThe Kosovo crisis has also highlighted the need for\r\nchange within the United Nations system itself. For\r\nexample, the world Organization is in serious need of a\r\nmechanism for compensating neighbouring States for\r\ndamage caused by international intervention or sanctions. I\r\nraise this issue not only because of the losses sustained by\r\nmy country during the past eight years from the embargo\r\nagainst Iraq and because of the military conflicts in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia, but also because this will increase the\r\nefficiency and boost the image of the United Nations. It\r\nwill certainly improve the credibility of United Nations-led\r\noperations and provide better motivation for individual\r\ncountries to participate.\r\nOn the other hand, the crisis in Kosovo promoted a\r\nnew type of relations among international organizations in\r\nrespect of the protection of human rights. As a result of the\r\ncrisis, a new kind of interface has been born between the\r\nUnited Nations and the regional organizations in Europe,\r\nsuch as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nthe European Union and regional initiatives such as the\r\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. This has\r\nstrengthened the role of the United Nations on that\r\ncontinent.\r\nToday, the Balkan people expect the international\r\ncommunity to show the same commitment to the future of\r\nthe region as it did during the crisis. Threats to peace and\r\nsecurity should cease to be the only international mobilizing\r\nfactor, and we must act towards this end.\r\nI am convinced that the developments in the former\r\nYugoslavia have not been due to some peculiar Balkan\r\nmentality or to any historic predestination. Half a century\r\nago, Western Europe was embroiled in wars that were no\r\nless bloody. The difference is that after the Second World\r\nWar the nations of Western Europe were rescued at the\r\nsame time from fascism and communism. This helped\r\nthem attain a democratic and economic homogeneity that,\r\nin turn, enabled victors and vanquished alike to set aside\r\ntheir differences and build their present prosperity while\r\nrespecting human rights and protecting their national\r\nidentity.\r\nUnfortunately, a different lot fell to the countries of\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe after the Second World War. States\r\nlike Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, preserved\r\nand built up their potential for liberal-democratic\r\ndevelopment and a free market, and the rest of the States\r\nin the region were forced to become a part of the Soviet\r\ncommunist system.\r\nToday, 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the\r\nBalkans still lack democratic homogeneity. This has been\r\na source of tensions, which, translated into ethnic hatred,\r\nare the favoured tool of any totalitarian regime attempting\r\nto cling to power. But I am sure it is wrong to apply a\r\ncommon denominator to the whole region. Today\r\nBulgaria, as well as most of the Balkan States, is a\r\ncountry with a working democracy, a free market\r\neconomy and the rule of law.\r\nAn earlier democratic homogenization of South-\r\nEastern Europe can be achieved only if the vision for our\r\ncountries\u0027 integration with the rest of the European States\r\nis shared by both the Balkan nations and the people of\r\nWestern Europe. Efforts and perseverance to this end are\r\nthe safest guarantee for converting the whole of Europe\r\ninto a continent of peace, stability and prosperity.\r\nThis common European vision fully applies to the\r\nfuture Yugoslavia. There is hardly any country that has a\r\nhigher stake in Yugoslavia\u0027s earliest possible integration\r\nin the family of democratic Balkan States than Bulgaria.\r\nI cannot but share here the concern of the world\r\ncommunity at the continuing ethnic tensions in Kosovo,\r\nwhich distance us from the desired state of peace and\r\nethnic tolerance. Six months ago I firmly supported\r\nNATO\u0027s operation, designed to end ethnic violence\r\nagainst the Albanian population in Kosovo. Today, just as\r\nfirmly, I oppose ethnic violence against the Serb\r\npopulation in that province.\r\nThe Balkans have paid a high price for peace in\r\nKosovo. Today the region needs direct assistance for its\r\nreconstruction. The priority beneficiaries should clearly be\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nthe hardest-hit countries and areas. Nonetheless, rather than\r\ndiscussing figures and reparations, I believe it would be\r\nmore productive for both the Balkans and the world to\r\nadopt a clear vision for the future of South-Eastern Europe.\r\nThis future has no alternative but the transformation of the\r\nBalkans into an integral part of a united Europe of the next\r\ncentury.\r\nThe General Assembly is the right forum to discuss\r\nthe issue of how this can be done. The path leads through\r\nthe direct rehabilitation and reconstruction of the\r\nBalkans — the best form of assistance for our region being\r\n“help for self-help”. The Stability Pact for South-Eastern\r\nEurope can provide the necessary framework.\r\nWe are convinced that the economic prosperity of the\r\nregion is a vital condition for achieving political stability.\r\nWe need infrastructure and strategic investment that\r\ngenerate and guarantee more security than any political\r\ndialogue. We need the promotion of trade and a maximum\r\ninvolvement of the economic potential of our countries in\r\nthe reconstruction effort. This will encourage them to\r\ncooperate with each other, while opening up the region and\r\ntransforming it into a natural, organic part of Europe, rather\r\nthan isolating it.\r\nThe crisis in Kosovo will be long over before its\r\neffects, such as the blockage of the Danube to shipping,\r\nhave been eliminated. The international waterway should\r\nnot become a new line of conflict; we should help it play\r\nits natural role of a link rather than allow it to act as a\r\ndividing line across Europe. The issue I am raising at this\r\npoint concerns both the economic damage that has been\r\ncaused and the very principles of the European architecture\r\nsince the end of the crisis in Kosovo.\r\nThe location of the Balkans at a crossroads has been\r\na curse for its people in the past; in today\u0027s globalized\r\nworld, it is our greatest blessing. The Balkans should serve\r\nas a link between Western Europe and Central Asia, the\r\nCaucasus and the Caspian Sea. It is one of the most\r\npromising regions for the coming century. A case in point\r\nis the restoration of the historic silk road, which crosses the\r\nwhole of Asia and links it to Europe. Restoration will entail\r\nhuge infrastructure projects and investment which in turn\r\ncould improve the quality of life of whole nations and\r\nregions.\r\nThe Balkan nations have already demonstrated a\r\nwillingness to adopt a new approach in their relations with\r\none another. The various forms of aid which neighbouring\r\nStates generously offered each other in response to the\r\nrecent natural disasters were a positive new sign. Another\r\nsignificant fact is the formation of the multinational peace\r\nforce for South-Eastern Europe, staffed jointly by\r\ncountries that were enemies earlier this century, including\r\nduring the cold war. It is an honour for my country that\r\nthe first headquarters of that force is based in Bulgaria.\r\nI cannot fail to mention here the success of the\r\ntrilateral initiatives between Bulgaria, Romania and\r\nGreece and between Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey for\r\ncooperation in combating organized crime and illegal\r\ndrugs and arms trafficking.\r\nThe Kosovo crisis calls for a contemporary rereading\r\nof the chronicles of the Balkan wars by all the Balkan\r\npeoples: the modern perspective will reveal to them that\r\nthose wars have done no country in the region any good.\r\nThe new task facing the political elite is to translate these\r\nlessons of history into a lasting commitment to peace and\r\ncooperation. Having paid such a high price in suffering\r\nand fear, it would be a pity if we failed to learn from our\r\nexperience.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate my country\u0027s willingness to\r\ncooperate with and contribute actively to the joint efforts\r\nof all Member States to streamline the United Nations, an\r\nOrganization with a key role in maintaining international\r\npeace and security and achieving the objectives of\r\nsustainable development in the coming century.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Bulgaria\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Petar Stoyanov, President of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez,\r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of El Salvador.\r\nMr. Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez, President of\r\nthe Republic of El Salvador, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador, His Excellency\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nMr. Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Flores Pérez (spoke in Spanish): I should\r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Didier Opertti for\r\nhis tireless work during the session just closed. I should\r\nalso like, on behalf of my Government and my compatriots,\r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his tireless work to carry\r\nforward the principles that unite all the nations represented\r\nin this Hall.\r\nI should like to tell the Assembly about the\r\nfundamental challenges facing my country, which have to\r\ndo, in those more specific circumstances, with those more\r\nuniversal issues that are the concern of this Organization of\r\nall nations.\r\nIn only my fourth month as President of El Salvador,\r\nI believe I must say that I recognize what a great honour it\r\nis for me to address the Assembly. During the months when\r\nI was a presidential candidate, my country was full of\r\nconfused and contradictory ideas as to its direction and\r\ndestiny. I therefore felt the need to counter the many\r\nopposing viewpoints with the one inescapable argument —\r\nthe reality of my country — in order to find what direction\r\nthat should be. That is why I dropped the political debate\r\nto delve deeply into the only matter that is of interest to\r\nany candidate in El Salvador: reading the relationship\r\nbetween the citizens of El Salvador and their country in\r\norder to move forward.\r\nThat enabled me to identify with rural people, potters,\r\nindustrialists and tradespeople in their efforts to build a\r\ndecent future for themselves and their families. At no time\r\nduring the conversations that I had in various parts of my\r\ncountry was I asked for privileges or perquisites, and\r\nneither did people demand assistance programmes: they all\r\nwanted to see their own families\u0027 destinies built on a\r\nfoundation of decent work and their own efforts. That\r\nrequirement, those aspirations addressed to my\r\nGovernment — and to which my Administration is duty\r\nbound — are what bring me to this rostrum to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nIt seems to me that in recent decades significant\r\nprogress has been made by our region and by the world as\r\na whole in developing all the political freedoms. My\r\ncountry in particular has moved rapidly during the past\r\nseven years through universal suffrage to democratic\r\ninstitutions and the will of the people expressed in all\r\norgans of the State. Just seven years ago, El Salvador was\r\ncompletely divided by a fratricidal war; today it has a fully\r\nfledged democracy. And in this effort to move forward,\r\nwe have been encouraged and stimulated by many of the\r\nnations whose representatives are listening to these words\r\nhere today.\r\nHowever, I must say that the commitment of nations\r\nto political freedom finds no corresponding stimulus to or\r\ndevelopment of economic freedoms: developed countries\r\nrespond to our efforts to bring our products to the world\r\nmarket with protectionism, trade barriers and quotas. By\r\ncontrast, our nations are completely open; we have\r\ncomplete economic freedom; we welcome free trade with\r\nall nations.\r\nWhat is the cause of this discontinuity between\r\npolitical freedoms and economic freedoms? How can we\r\npromote political freedom and democracy when the world\r\nis being closed to economic freedom? Neither I nor my\r\ncompatriots are asking the world for assistance because of\r\npoverty: we are trying to build honourable nations forged\r\nby our own work. That is the aspiration of my\r\ncompatriots, of El Salvador, and of all nations that can\r\nhold up their heads in dignity. It is absurd for us to be\r\ncalled upon to demonstrate openness when the developed\r\ncountries respond with protectionism.\r\nThat is why it is important that I highlight these\r\nessential challenges. We must choose the path of freedom,\r\nbut not freedom limited to certain areas. It must be\r\nfreedom in all its fullness. If political freedom is not\r\nmatched by economic freedom, how can we justify the\r\nefforts of those of us who are trying to change our\r\ncountries institutionally in order to make them freer?\r\nSome in our region are waxing nostalgic about State\r\ninterventionism and other forms of authoritarianism, as a\r\nway of solving our problems.\r\nFuture generations will not judge us only by our\r\ndeeds; they will judge us too by what we fail to do. If we\r\nlack the courage to speak or to act, they will demand to\r\nknow why, on the threshold of the new millennium, we\r\ndid not want genuinely to open the world to freedom.\r\nLet me acknowledge United Nations assistance and\r\nintervention in my country. The efforts of Salvadorans to\r\nmeet our aspirations to lasting peace would not have met\r\nwith success without the proper forum through which to\r\nbring conciliation among Salvadorans: the United Nations.\r\nWe must therefore express our gratitude to the\r\nOrganization, a house of concord among nations, and to\r\nits Member States, for their involvement in the\r\nachievement of our Peace Agreement. El Salvador has\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nonly one way of expressing that gratitude: while\r\nunderstanding that historical experiences vary, we offer the\r\nworld our humble experience so that it may be studied by\r\nany country that chooses to resolve its conflicts by taking\r\nthe path of concord.\r\nFollowing the armed conflict, hundreds of thousands\r\nof Salvadorans were forced to leave their homes and\r\ncommunities in order to feed their families. Many of my\r\ncompatriots have been received in nations represented in\r\nthis Hall. Let me address the nations in which Salvadorans\r\nare living, sometimes in difficult circumstances: I ask for\r\nunderstanding for my compatriots; they are in your\r\ncountries solely because they have to earn a living for their\r\nfamilies. They must not be blamed for social tensions that\r\npredate their arrival. I call for respect for those\r\nSalvadorans. Citizens of the world do not lose their dignity\r\nor their rights when they become emigrants. And I wish to\r\nsend this message to my compatriots scattered across the\r\nglobe because of the armed struggle: in El Salvador there\r\nwill always be room for them to thrive. Our common\r\ndestiny is linked to our hopes and to a hopeful future: that\r\nwe should be together. I am here not only to represent you\r\nbut to defend your rights.\r\nIn the name of the freedom I have so often evoked, let\r\nme speak of a matter that has been a concern of the\r\nGeneral Assembly: that of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan. We believe that when a people, expressing its\r\nsovereign will through democratic elections, elects officials,\r\nchooses a common destiny and builds a vision of its\r\nrelations with the rest of the world, it is has the absolute\r\nright to participate on an equal footing with the rest of us\r\nin this forum. For nearly 50 years, we Salvadorans have\r\nmaintained relations of all kinds with the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan. It is our firm hope that that friendly people will\r\nbe able to have a voice in this forum.\r\nWe also express our concern that so many years have\r\ngone by, and that the matter of setting up operational\r\nmachinery to promote peace among nations has so often\r\ncome before the Security Council without any resolution. It\r\nis a paradox that, as we speak of concord for the next\r\nmillennium, we have been unable to reach agreement on\r\nthis matter. This weakens all; it weakens the United\r\nNations. It is a betrayal of the beliefs of all the nations that\r\nwant the Organization to participate actively in promoting\r\npeace.\r\nI stand in solidarity with nations that have been the\r\nvictims of natural disasters. We in Central America owe a\r\ndebt of gratitude to all who helped us when the recent\r\nhurricane devastated our Republics — non-governmental\r\norganizations, Governments, the United Nations and\r\nfriendly nations. That debt of gratitude can be converted\r\nto solidarity only if we say that we in turn want to do our\r\nutmost to help other nations that have been the victims of\r\nnatural disasters, such as Turkey and the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan, not to mention other, no less painful\r\ndifficulties such as the conflict that is of such grave\r\nconcern to our Colombian brethren.\r\nIn solidarity between the peoples of Latin America\r\nand in solidarity between our two countries — for we too\r\nhave experienced such a conflict — we offer our brothers\r\nin Colombia any kind of assistance or experience they ask\r\nfor to deal successfully with this problem so like the one\r\nthat tore apart the lives of the people of El Salvador.\r\nIn this Hall that is the forum for the comity of\r\nnations, it is incumbent upon us to give substance to the\r\nrhetoric of our words. For this reason, since you have\r\ndone me the honour of patiently listening to me, I would\r\nlike to say to you that we, just as you, in our efforts for\r\nour common future, foresee that the entire world will live\r\nin peace, justice and liberty in the years to come.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI thank the President of the Republic of El Salvador for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez, President of\r\nthe Republic of El Salvador, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Rinchinnyamyn Amarjargal, Prime\r\nMinister of Mongolia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Rinchinnyamyn Amarjargal, Prime Minister of\r\nMongolia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of Mongolia, Mr. Rinchinnyamyn\r\nAmarjargal, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nMr. Amarjargal (Mongolia): The present session\r\nprovides Member States with an opportunity to hold a\r\nserious and substantive review of world affairs and the role\r\nof the United Nations, with particular focus on the\r\nforthcoming twenty-first century. In this respect, I have no\r\ndoubt that the deliberations here will be useful in preparing\r\nfor the millennium summit and the Millennium Assembly\r\nnext year, to which events the Mongolian Government\r\nattaches great importance.\r\nThe United Nations is a truly universal organization\r\ncomprising large and small, developed and developing\r\ncountries. This year its membership reached 188 with the\r\nadmission of three new members: I take this opportunity to\r\nconvey the warm congratulations of the Mongolian people\r\nto the peoples of Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga on this\r\nauspicious occasion.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that our Organization is not\r\nonly enlarging its ranks but is also making tangible efforts\r\nto restructure its activities in order to enhance its efficiency\r\nand effectiveness. This is a movement in the right direction.\r\nFurther promotion of reforms is in the interests of the entire\r\ninternational community, especially the small and medium-\r\nsized States. Mongolia consistently supports United Nations\r\nreforms aimed at further strengthening the Organization’s\r\nrole in ensuring international peace and security and\r\npromoting disarmament, development, social progress and\r\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts in various parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nIncreasing globalization and interdependence make it\r\nimperative that the international community should redouble\r\nits cooperative efforts to meet existing and future\r\nchallenges and ensure a more secure environment for all\r\nnations. Globalization and interdependence also demonstrate\r\nthe growing importance of multilateralism in world affairs\r\nand thus the need to further strengthen and invigorate the\r\nUnited Nations and other international institutions. As a\r\nresult of its reforms, the United Nations should become\r\nmore viable and effective, addressing the world’s problems\r\nequitably.\r\nThe 1999 report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/54/1) gives, in our view, a clear and\r\nanalytical review of United Nations activities, its\r\nachievements and setbacks, and the challenges that lie\r\nahead; it contains specific proposals on further measures to\r\nimprove the Organization’s performance the better to serve\r\nthe interests of its Member States. The Mongolian\r\nGovernment is supportive of the idea advanced by the\r\nSecretary-General in paragraph 61 of his report concerning\r\nthe need to shift from a culture of reaction, to a culture of\r\nprevention. It is in this spirit that Mongolia will next\r\nweek sign a memorandum of understanding with the\r\nUnited Nations on standby agreements whereby it would\r\npledge to participate in future United Nations operations\r\nby contributing staff officers, military observers and\r\nmedical officers.\r\nMongolia is consistently pursuing its all-embracing\r\ndemocratic reforms and its transition to a market\r\neconomy. Neither is easy. However, the Government and\r\nthe people of Mongolia are strongly committed to the\r\nchoice they made 10 years ago. From this rostrum, I\r\nwould like to reaffirm that the democratic process in\r\nMongolia is irreversible and that Mongolia’s foreign\r\npolicy will remain constant. My Government greatly\r\nappreciates the support and assistance given Mongolia by\r\nthe international community of donor countries and\r\ninternational organizations. That support and assistance\r\ncontinue to be an important factor in our reform and\r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nThe major thrust of Mongolia’s development strategy\r\nis to accelerate economic growth by further advancing\r\nmacroeconomic stabilization and development of a\r\nprivate-sector-led economy. Mongolia is giving high\r\npriority to creating an economic system that is flexible,\r\nopen, allows a free flow of foreign capital, ensures a\r\ncompetitive environment and is underpinned by stable\r\ngovernment policies and a reinvigorated, modern financial\r\nsector that encourages economic growth. In pursuing this\r\npolicy, my Government pays particular attention to the\r\nsocial dimensions of economic reforms, namely poverty\r\nalleviation, unemployment reduction and protection for\r\nthe vulnerable strata of the country’s population.\r\nMongolia’s foreign policy activities aim to create a\r\nfavourable external environment for implementing this\r\ndevelopment strategy. At the same time, my country is\r\nstriving to make its contribution to strengthening\r\ninternational peace and stability generally as well as\r\npromoting dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion. Active participation in regional affairs —\r\nintegration into regional processes coupled with\r\nconsolidation of our bilateral ties with the countries of the\r\nregion — is one of Mongolia’s foreign policy priorities.\r\nI am pleased to say that this year has been especially\r\nfruitful in this respect.\r\nInternational developments highlight once again the\r\nfragility of peace and stability in certain areas of the\r\nworld and the need for concerted actions and for the\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nincreased cooperation of States to prevent the outbreak of\r\nnew conflicts, seek viable solutions to the existing disputes\r\nand promote further mutual understanding and trust among\r\nnations.\r\nWhile noting some positive developments in\r\ninternational relations, Mongolia is seriously concerned with\r\nthe lingering zones of tension, ethnic strife and armed\r\nconflict in Africa, Asia and Europe. It calls on the parties\r\ninvolved to display restraint and seek peaceful solutions\r\nthrough political dialogue and negotiations. In this context\r\nMongolia welcomes the resumption of the peace process in\r\nthe Middle East, which in our view should lead to a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region in\r\ncompliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions\r\nand the principle of land for peace.\r\nMongolia also duly appreciates the steps taken by the\r\nSecurity Council to address the emergency situation in East\r\nTimor and welcomes the cooperative approach of the\r\nGovernment of Indonesia regarding the establishment of a\r\nmultinational force to halt and reverse the escalation of the\r\nhuman catastrophe there. The people of East Timor have\r\noverwhelmingly expressed themselves in favour of\r\nindependence.\r\nMy delegation stresses the importance of continuing\r\nthe intra-Korean dialogue and the four-party talks for peace\r\nand stability on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-\r\nPacific region in general.\r\nWe are concerned about the tension in South Asia and\r\nadd our voice to that of the international community, which\r\nis calling on India and Pakistan to proceed to political\r\ndialogue and search for a peaceful solution to their dispute.\r\nPeace and stability are essential prerequisites for\r\npromoting economic development and social progress. That\r\nis why arms control and disarmament, particularly nuclear\r\ndisarmament, remain at the top of the global agenda.\r\nEfforts to achieve further substantive progress in arms\r\ncontrol and disarmament should be intensified. Agreements\r\nshould be honoured and implemented. Nuclear tests, missile\r\ntechnology developments, concerns over the anti-ballistic\r\nmissile treaty — all point to the urgent need for\r\ninvigorating our activities in this field. International arms\r\ncontrol efforts need to be comprehensive and include all\r\naspects of arms and military technology. Strengthening of\r\nthe nuclear non-proliferation regime stands out as one of\r\nthe top priorities, due not only to the devastating nature of\r\nnuclear weapons and the enormous existing arsenal of them,\r\nbut also to the negative effect they have on the\r\ndisarmament process in general.\r\nMongolia fully supports adopting multilateral norms\r\nrestraining the development and possession of medium-\r\nrange missiles and preventing their proliferation. We\r\nbelieve that progress on the START track will be helpful\r\nin advancing disarmament negotiations in all areas.\r\nNuclear disarmament also calls for speedy agreement on\r\nbanning fissile materials for nuclear-weapons purposes.\r\nMongolia continues to attach great importance to\r\nestablishing effective international arrangements to assure\r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use\r\nof nuclear weapons.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the outcome of the 1999\r\nsessions of the Disarmament Commission and of the\r\nPreparatory Committee for the year 2000 Review\r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Mongolia attaches\r\ngreat importance to the role of the Review Conference in\r\nstrengthening the international regime of nuclear non-\r\nproliferation. It also favours the earliest possible\r\nconvening of the fourth special session of the General\r\nAssembly devoted to disarmament.\r\nThree years have elapsed since the adoption by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty, which was a landmark event in the field of\r\nnuclear disarmament. Regrettably, this important\r\ninternational instrument has not yet come into force.\r\nMongolia wishes to reiterate its call on those States that\r\nhave not done so to sign and ratify the Treaty as soon as\r\npossible and thus contribute to the expeditious realization\r\nof its noble objectives. We sincerely hope that the\r\nforthcoming conference of the States that have ratified\r\nthis Treaty will be conducive to taking the necessary\r\nmeasures to this end.\r\nIt is our belief that all States, irrespective of their\r\nsize and weight, can facilitate the attaining of the overall\r\ngoal of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. That\r\nis why we believe that the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones in different parts of the world should\r\nbe encouraged and supported. For its part, Mongolia is\r\nmaking efforts in this respect by declaring its territory a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone and taking the subsequent steps\r\nnecessary to institutionalize its nuclear-weapon-free status.\r\nLast year the General Assembly adopted by\r\nconsensus resolution 53/77 D on Mongolia’s international\r\nsecurity and nuclear-weapon-free status. This was a\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nsignificant and encouraging event for Mongolia, testifying\r\nto the existence of broad international support for our\r\nobjectives and efforts. The adoption of the resolution\r\nconstitutes an important contribution not only to Mongolia’s\r\nsecurity, but also — given Mongolia’s strategic location —\r\nto regional security. Implementation of the main provisions\r\nof the resolution — in cooperation with other Member\r\ncountries, including the five nuclear-weapon States, and the\r\nUnited Nations — is one of the major objectives of our\r\nforeign policy. The Mongolian Government has recently\r\ncirculated a memorandum on this issue as an official United\r\nNations document, in which it pointed out, inter alia, that\r\nthe Mongolian parliament is considering the adoption of\r\nlegislation defining its nuclear-weapon-free status.\r\nRecently Mongolia hosted a United Nations regional\r\ndisarmament meeting, one of the agenda items of which\r\nwas the issue of Mongolia’s international security and\r\nnuclear-weapon-free status. The meeting proved to be\r\nuseful in clarifying the pressing security issues, and it\r\nprovided an opportunity for the first in-depth analysis and\r\ndiscussion of Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free status in the\r\nlight of its external security. We believe that identifying\r\nand defining Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free status will\r\ncontribute to enhancing predictability, stability and\r\nconfidence in north-east Asia.\r\nMy Government fully shares the aspirations to ban\r\nanti-personnel landmines and welcomes the entry into force\r\nof the Ottawa Convention. The illicit trafficking in small\r\narms and light weapons is a matter of growing concern for\r\nthe international community. Therefore Mongolia supports\r\nthe convening of an international conference to consider\r\nthis issue in 2001.\r\nConsidering that only comprehensive arms-control and\r\ndisarmament measures will be effective in ensuring\r\ninternational security, we, like many others, stand for\r\nprompt agreement on a new comprehensive and non-\r\nselective agenda for disarmament that will address the\r\nrelevant issues in a balanced manner, taking into account,\r\namong other things, the need to prevent the development\r\nand use of new weapons as well as to demilitarize the\r\nglobal economy by reducing military budgets and shifting\r\nresources towards human-security programmes.\r\nDevelopment issues continue to be the focus of\r\nattention of national Governments and international\r\norganizations and undoubtedly will be a major challenge in\r\nthe forthcoming century. Globalization affects all States,\r\nthough differently and unevenly. Many developing\r\ncountries, particularly the least developed, not only fail to\r\nenjoy the benefits of globalization, but are being further\r\nmarginalized. Therefore, the adverse effects of\r\nglobalization should be addressed seriously and the\r\nUnited Nations should be more actively involved in the\r\nissue.\r\nThe Asian economic and financial crisis has had\r\nsignificant socio-economic and security implications for\r\nthe countries of the region. Though the situation is\r\nsomehow stabilizing and the countries directly hit by the\r\ncrisis are showing some signs of recovery, the\r\ninternational community should draw the necessary\r\nlessons from this crisis and consider ways and means of\r\npreventing such crises in the future.\r\nWhile appreciating the work done by the United\r\nNations in the social and economic fields, my delegation\r\nwould like to underline the importance of taking further\r\neffective measures to ensure the best utilization of the\r\nexisting capacities and comparative advantages of the\r\nOrganization. Therefore, it seems appropriate to stress the\r\nnecessity of closer interaction and cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and other relevant\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nThe financing of development represents a very\r\nsensitive and pressing issue that requires special attention\r\non the part of the international community. Mongolia\r\nbelieves that the high-level intergovernmental meeting on\r\nfinancing for development to be held in 2001 will be\r\ntimely in exploring the various options of promoting\r\nfinancial stability and development. In this respect,\r\nrelieving the debt burden of the highly indebted\r\ndeveloping countries would be a form of contribution to\r\ntheir development efforts. We also attach great\r\nimportance to the South-South summit and the tenth\r\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD X), to be held next year.\r\nMongolia supports the universality of the World\r\nTrade Organization. The new round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations should facilitate the integration of the\r\ndeveloping countries into the world economy. The\r\nexpansion of international cooperation for development\r\nshould place particular emphasis on assisting the most\r\nvulnerable countries, which find themselves more and\r\nmore marginalized and insecure. Unfavourable\r\ngeographical location serves as a major impediment to the\r\ndevelopment efforts of landlocked developing countries.\r\nThe problems of this group of States demand the\r\nincreased attention and support of the international\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\ncommunity. The steps that could ease the hardships of these\r\ncountries were recently examined in New York at the\r\nfourth Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked\r\nand Transit Developing Countries and Representatives of\r\nDonor Countries and Financial and Development\r\nInstitutions. Its outcome should be endorsed by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nIn North-East Asia, efforts are under way to conclude\r\na subregional agreement on transit transportation as a\r\nfollow-up to the decisions of the 1997 Ulan Bator meeting\r\non transit transportation. The conclusion of this agreement\r\nwill create a legal framework for facilitating transit trade\r\nnot only within the subregion, but well beyond it.\r\nSustainable development, environmental degradation,\r\nillicit drug trafficking, HIV/AIDS, organized crime and\r\nother transboundary problems should be adequately\r\naddressed at the national, regional and global levels. The\r\n“+5” review special sessions of the General Assembly held\r\nor scheduled to be held as follow-ups to the United Nations\r\nsummit conferences are important not only for assessing the\r\nwork done, but also for giving a fresh impetus to the\r\nimplementation of their objectives at all levels.\r\nAt the national level, Mongolia, in close partnership\r\nwith the United Nations organizations and the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, successfully organized the\r\nOne-World Conference Series in 1998-1999. The aim of the\r\nsix national conferences was to raise awareness at the\r\ngrass-roots level of the commitments made at the global\r\nconferences and to ensure their integrated and coordinated\r\nfollow-up.\r\nMongolia is committed to the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights and supports the strengthening\r\nof the existing international instruments in this field. We\r\nbelieve that the approval at this session of the draft optional\r\nprotocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\r\nof Discrimination against Women would mark an important\r\ncontribution to the protection and promotion of human\r\nrights and the dignity of women the world over.\r\nContinued gross violations of human rights make it\r\nimperative to speed up the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. Mongolia highly appreciates\r\nand fully supports the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity in this respect. Likewise, Mongolia joins other\r\nStates in condemning terrorist acts that are taking the lives\r\nof an increasing number of innocent people in various parts\r\nof the world and supports every effort of Member States\r\nand of the international community as a whole to fight all\r\nforms of terrorism and strengthen the relevant\r\ninternational instruments.\r\nThis year, the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law is drawing to a close. The decade has\r\nbeen instrumental in drawing the international\r\ncommunity\u0027s attention to the need for the codification and\r\nprogressive development of international law. Today,\r\ninternational law is regulating many aspects of\r\ninternational relations. I agree with the Secretary-General\r\nthat one of the greatest accomplishments of the twentieth\r\ncentury is the creation of an international code of human\r\nrights, to which the outgoing Decade has duly\r\ncontributed. One of the practical results of the Decade\r\nwas the adoption last year, on Mongolia\u0027s initiative, by\r\nthe General Assembly of a set of principles and\r\nguidelines for international negotiations that could be\r\nuseful in conducting negotiations to manage international\r\nrelations, to peacefully settle disputes and to create new\r\ninternational norms of conduct for States.\r\nFully conscious of the challenges that lie ahead,\r\nmankind still looks forward to the twenty-first century\r\nwith great expectations and hope. I believe it is the\r\nearnest hope and keen desire of all the peoples of the\r\nworld that the next century be far better in all respects,\r\nmore progressive and prosperous, than the outgoing one.\r\nWhere there is a will, there will surely be a way to\r\nachieve it. It is up to Member States to make the dream\r\na reality. As the Secretary-General has underlined in his\r\nreport, we can do it.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Mongolia for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Rinchinnyamyn Amarjargal, Prime Minister of\r\nMongolia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Veiga, Prime Minister of Cape\r\nVerde\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Cape Verde.\r\nMr. Carlos Veiga, Prime Minister of Cape Verde,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of Cape Verde, Mr. Veiga, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nMr. Veiga (Cape Verde)(spoke in Portuguese; French\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): Mr. President, it gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to convey to you and your country, Namibia,\r\nmy heartfelt congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly for this session. We\r\nare fully confident that your ability, well-known experience\r\nand personal talent will crown our work with success, to\r\nwhich the delegation of Cape Verde will contribute its\r\ngreatest efforts.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation and\r\ngratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of\r\nUruguay, for the professionalism and devotion with which\r\nhe conducted the work of the Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession. We would also like to say that, at a time when the\r\ninternational community must confront complex challenges,\r\nit is a great privilege for the United Nations to be able to\r\nrely on the creativity, dynamism and determination that the\r\nSecretary-General brings to his lofty office.\r\nWe are pleased to welcome the Republics of Kiribati\r\nand Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as new members in\r\nour Organization.\r\nThe annual session of the General Assembly which\r\nopened a few days ago will lead us into the next\r\nmillennium; during the session, preparations will be made\r\nfor various important events planned for the year 2000,\r\nincluding the special sessions of the General Assembly on\r\nthe implementation of the outcome of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development and Further Initiatives and the\r\nFourth World Conference on Women.\r\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly will\r\nalso prepare for a major event, the millennium summit.\r\nTherefore, this will be a time when we will need to\r\ndemonstrate not only our most lucid thinking, but also and\r\nperhaps primarily a firm will to act. The core of our\r\ndiscussions will be the great challenges that humanity faces\r\ntoday and will face in the foreseeable future, and we will\r\nneed to identify what must be done to meet them\r\nsuccessfully. In that regard, clarification of the role which\r\nthe United Nations must play and specific ways for it to\r\nattain this goal must be a priority of the summit agenda.\r\nWe are at the end of a decade marked by a new phase\r\nin international affairs, a decade, however, that was one of\r\nunmet expectations when we think back to how high they\r\nwere at its beginning. The experience of the past few years\r\nhas been one of continuous increase in the complexity and\r\nfrequency of emerging situations leading to a veritable\r\noverhaul of concepts and perceptions. But we are not sure\r\nthat we are any closer to the major solutions we lack. It\r\nmight even be said that we have embarked on a process\r\nthat has its own logic and momentum and in which the\r\nattainment of common aspirations does not always seem\r\nto be the driving force. Yet today, and not only today, we\r\nhave at our disposal sufficient intellectual and material\r\nresources to build a successful future. It is therefore\r\ndisquieting to have to acknowledge that, despite all this\r\npotential, humankind is still incapable of controlling its\r\nown destiny. Acquiring this ability is an imperative,\r\ntherefore, and must be the fundamental goal of our\r\ndebates at the dawn of the new millennium.\r\nGiven that the destiny of humankind is a collective\r\nchallenge, control over it must be sought collectively for\r\nit to be meaningful. The effective implementation of the\r\nconcept of “international community”, which has been the\r\nbasis of our political philosophy for a long time now, can\r\nno longer be avoided or postponed as it has been so far.\r\nWhen the millennium summit meets a year from\r\nnow, the leaders of the world must be prepared to start\r\nrebuilding an international community and usher in a new\r\nera in which sustainable human development will become\r\na real right for all peoples; in which international justice\r\nwill be more effective; and in which the United Nations\r\nCharter will no longer be applied in a manner that bends\r\nwith the wind.\r\nDemocracy as a means of ordering and managing\r\nsocieties has seen important progress during this decade.\r\nIn its most visible aspects, such as the selection of leaders\r\nthrough pluralistic, more transparent processes, it is\r\nbased on an understanding that governance by elected\r\nofficials can and should bring peace, prosperity and\r\njustice to a society and that elected leaders are politically\r\naccountable for the results obtained.\r\nAs we all know, these assumptions are not absolute\r\nand are becoming even less so. When looking at\r\ngovernments individually, it is apparent that command\r\nand control of important factors which determine the\r\nwell-being of citizens are sorely lacking. Meeting the\r\nnecessary conditions for each State to succeed depends to\r\na large extent on multilateral concertation and\r\ncooperation. This dialogue between States, however, will\r\nnot be enough to resolve all the points at issue, which are\r\nincreasingly in the hands of third parties.\r\nToday, therefore, there is a growing gap between\r\nsocial responsibility — which remains limited to the\r\npublic and the political domains — and the availability\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nof the wherewithal and will to act on which this\r\nresponsibility is based. However the situation evolves,\r\nadjustment must be ensured through revitalization of this\r\nsame concept of “international community” to which I\r\nreferred. Once again, this concept proves to be the\r\ncornerstone of the quest for a harmonious and prosperous\r\ndestiny for humankind.\r\nThe progress to which we aspire will always coexist\r\nwith differences and even inequality. Of that we are well\r\naware. But the shocking magnitude of poverty today must\r\nprovoke a gut feeling of rejection that makes it imperative\r\nfor this situation to be remedied at any cost. The palliative\r\nmeasures that we seek to introduce and maintain should not\r\nlull us and cannot take the place of definitive solutions. It\r\nis imperative that poverty should no longer be seen as an\r\nacceptable or inevitable by-product of the economic and\r\nsocial process: rather, we should come to see it as a serious\r\nbreakdown in it that must be attacked and corrected. Even\r\nin societies considered to be well off, poverty victimizes\r\ncertain segments of the population that lack even the\r\nminimum material conditions to live in dignity. The least-\r\ndeveloped countries are even less able to roll back poverty\r\nin any meaningful way.\r\nSpeaking of poverty necessarily prompts a discussion\r\nof the situation in Africa, where the greatest number of\r\nleast-developed countries are found. We have said\r\nbefore — and this does not detract from Africa\u0027s own,\r\ninherent responsibility — that the way Africa has been left\r\nout of development is also a failure of the international\r\nsystem. Africa\u0027s development difficulties have often been\r\naggravated by conflicts, but we cannot just wait for peace\r\nto happen there or be discouraged by the current situation.\r\nFinally, while conflicts in Africa have many causes,\r\neconomic underdevelopment has been recognized as an\r\nimportant factor. It is therefore regrettable to witness the\r\nreduction in development assistance in Africa; this has a\r\ndirect negative impact on the living conditions of its\r\npeoples, including a decline in health standards, the\r\ndooming to failure of adequate education prospects and a\r\nslowdown in provision of the necessary African\r\ninfrastructure. The impact has been worsened by the\r\ndecrease in official development assistance to small island\r\ndeveloping States, some of which — in apparent\r\ncontradiction to their particular structural constraints — are\r\nshowing relatively acceptable human development\r\nindicators and higher gross national product per head\r\nindicators than those found at the bottom of the world\r\nscale. That, together with the good performance of these\r\ncountries, has often been used to justify a precipitous and\r\ndisastrous reduction in official development assistance.\r\nWe would not claim that our countries should be\r\nspared from changing and improving in order to mobilize\r\nand rechannel resources towards these areas and many\r\nothers that I have mentioned. I would, however, stress\r\nthat this reduction in assistance, due to a certain “fatigue”\r\nthat sometimes takes on the appearance of a form of\r\npunishment, cannot solve anything. Rather, development\r\nassistance policy should continue to seek means of\r\ncombating and eliminating wasteful activities and\r\nguarantee an effective channelling of resources towards\r\nactivities that are necessary to development.\r\nOf course, we agree that official development\r\nassistance is not the key to prosperity. But, added to\r\nvigorous strides with regard to debt to ease the current\r\nfinancial stranglehold, it facilitates the creation of\r\nfavourable human and material conditions for direct\r\ninvestment, competitiveness, fruitful trade and Africa’s\r\nlasting integration into the world economy.\r\nThis reference to Africa’s external debt is not mere\r\nrhetoric. While welcoming recent steps taken and\r\nannounced by countries and groups of creditors that have\r\na particular solidarity with Africa, I must say that this\r\nquestion has for too long been dealt with too\r\nungenerously, too late and too slowly. Today’s steps,\r\nlimited in content and in the range of countries concerned,\r\nand with overly restrictive eligibility conditions, would\r\nhave had much more impact if they had been taken when\r\nthey were so urgently demanded a long time ago.\r\nMoreover, they would have facilitated the continuation\r\nand necessary deepening of the economic and political\r\nreforms under way on the African continent, and would\r\nhave stimulated increased African regional cooperation.\r\nAfter 24 years of illegal occupation and extreme\r\nsuffering inflicted on the people of East Timor, the\r\nprocess of self-determination appeared to be leading to an\r\nhonourable conclusion for all interested parties. But with\r\ngreat dismay and indignation we witnessed violent events\r\nin the Territory in recent weeks. These vile acts,\r\nperpetrated by people determined to reverse the choice of\r\nindependence that the Timorese clearly expressed at the\r\nballot box, could and should have been prevented, and\r\nthey should receive the total rejection and most vigorous,\r\neffective condemnation of the international community.\r\nSince the illegal occupation and annexation of East\r\nTimor by Indonesia, Cape Verde always strongly\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\ndefended the cause of the Timorese people and always\r\nfought for the retention of the problem of East Timor on\r\nthe Assembly\u0027s agenda. We reaffirm our tireless support for\r\nEast Timor’s independence and for the territorial integrity\r\nof this fraternal country, and we call upon the United\r\nNations to act with all necessary firmness to promote and\r\nguarantee the full implementation of the New York\r\nagreements, in particular the provisions of Security Council\r\nresolution 1264 (1999).\r\nWe therefore welcome the arrival of the International\r\nForce in East Timor (INTERFET) and strongly support any\r\nnecessary measures it might take to carry out its mission of\r\nrestoring order and security; protecting the Timorese people\r\nfrom coercion, intimidation, violence and terrorism; and\r\nguaranteeing a peaceful transition towards independence.\r\nHowever, our pleasure at the effective quick reaction\r\nby the international community as a result of the pressure\r\nof worldwide public opinion should not allow us to forget\r\nthe thousands of Timorese suffering great shortages and\r\nbrutal violations of their most elementary human rights, or\r\nthe men, women and children persecuted and forcibly\r\ndeported to West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia simply\r\nbecause they freely exercised the right of a people to self-\r\ndetermination under the aegis of the United Nations. It\r\nfollows that the international community has a moral and\r\nlegal duty to give them immediate, sufficient humanitarian\r\nassistance; to promote and guarantee the return of all\r\nTimorese refugees and deported persons, with dignity and\r\nsecurity; to bring to international justice all those morally\r\nand physically responsible for crimes against humanity and\r\ngross violations of the most fundamental human rights,\r\ncommitted in East Timor in a planned, systematic way; and\r\nto provide substantial, effective support for the\r\nreconstruction of a country which has suffered from\r\ncriminal, premeditated destruction.\r\nIn Angola, unfortunately, hostilities have resumed and\r\nthe prospects for the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol\r\nhave vanished, despite United Nations intervention, which,\r\nit must be acknowledged, has not been successful. The\r\nclear inability of the international community to secure\r\nstrict compliance by all the parties and States concerned\r\nwith the commitments that they undertook under\r\nagreements negotiated under the aegis of the United\r\nNations, including resolutions of its own bodies, has led to\r\nthe re-emergence of this conflict. That is because it has not\r\nprevented UNITA from seriously rearming and impeding\r\nthe extension of State administration to the whole of\r\nAngola\u0027s territory.\r\nThe magnitude of the long and bloody conflict in\r\nAngola should be a source of great concern to the\r\ninternational community, which should continue and\r\nintensify its efforts to identify possible ways of restoring\r\npeace to Angola, efforts that should be deployed by all\r\nthe entities that can contribute. Cape Verde will not fail\r\nto participate to the extent that its resources allow.\r\nOne priority must be to bring together everything\r\nneeded to deal with the unprecedented humanitarian\r\ncatastrophe hitting Angola. The need is great and urgent.\r\nEverything possible should be done to provide immediate\r\nand adequate humanitarian assistance to the people\r\nsuffering from the scourge of war.\r\nCape Verde follows with the same fraternal\r\nsolidarity developments in neighbouring Guinea-Bissau,\r\nwhere the Government is making preparations, with the\r\nassistance of the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity, to hold free democratic elections.\r\nWe look forward to the success of the people of\r\nGuinea-Bissau as it enters a new stage in its life, when\r\nthe whole of society is preparing to rebuild its country\r\nand to use all of its resources to improve its living\r\nconditions. We call upon the international community to\r\nprovide ongoing generous support to rebuild the country\r\nwithin this long-term process.\r\nWe welcome recent events reflecting the decision of\r\nthe United Nations to intervene more concretely to\r\nmaintain peace in Africa, particularly in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and Sierra Leone — and we hope\r\nsoon in Eritrea and in Ethiopia.\r\nToday it is clear that our continent is more than ever\r\ndetermined to harmonize its efforts to control and resolve\r\nconflicts in the region while hoping for the necessary\r\noutside support to strengthen its capacity in this regard.\r\nRegional responsibilities cannot, however, take the place\r\nof the responsibilities of the United Nations, which must\r\nfully play the role given it by the Charter.\r\nAs well as efforts to contain and resolve conflicts,\r\nthere must be — as has often been stated, but all too\r\noften not put into practice — efforts to prevent them.\r\nThey are often rooted in long-standing situations of\r\ninjustice, exclusion, inequality and the denial of rights.\r\nThe latter is something that individuals, groups and even\r\nwhole nations continue to suffer from.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nWherever flouted dignity cannot properly voice its\r\nlegitimate demands, wherever those demands do not receive\r\na reasonable response, conflict is brewing. It is true that\r\nsome established situations do not lend themselves to rapid\r\nor dramatic change. In those cases sincere dialogue and\r\nhealthy compromise may open the way to a progress that\r\nintolerance and lack of willingness can never bring about.\r\nWhile the conflicts prevailing today are basically\r\ninternal, it would be irresponsible for us to ignore the\r\nexternal factors that feed them. From classic territorial\r\ndisputes to more diffuse questions with an impact on the\r\nacquisition of advantages in economic competition, we see\r\non the international scene various factors that thwart the\r\ndesired security and balance. We must replace the narrow\r\ncriterion of national self-interest, or its equivalents, as the\r\nparadigm of international affairs with multilateral\r\nparticipative arrangements based on equity.\r\nAmong the items on the agenda that this session\r\ninherited from the previous one, reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is a key element for rebuilding and revitalizing the\r\nUnited Nations. For some years it has been the subject of\r\nongoing negotiations. This entire time, we feel, was needed\r\nfor the various bases and arguments underpinning existing\r\npositions and proposals to be properly understood.\r\nThe questions posed are complex, and we cannot deny\r\nthe relevance of any position. The basic divergence, we\r\nthink, lies in the priority given by some to the preservation\r\nof the Council’s effectiveness and by others to the\r\nrepresentation of the current body of Member States. We\r\nbelieve that the impasse we are facing is clear and that the\r\nconsideration we have already given to the matter should\r\nenable us to take decisions in the not-too-distant future.\r\nWe believe that increasing the Council’s effectiveness,\r\nwhile increasing the number of its members, is a challenge\r\nwithin our grasp. In our view, we should not give more\r\nweight to the size of the gap, which is quite small, between\r\nthe various proposals made in this area than to the special\r\nnature of the fundamental principles of representative\r\nparticipation.\r\nFor example, how can one, by attaching more\r\nimportance to the question of effectiveness, refuse to give\r\nthe African countries, which represent almost 30 per cent\r\nof the United Nations membership, at least two permanent\r\nseats enjoying full powers?\r\nWe hope, Mr. President, that under your enlightened\r\nguidance we can make a big leap forward in the\r\nconsideration of this important agenda item during the\r\ncurrent session.\r\nBefore I conclude, I wish to reiterate what a constant\r\nsource of inspiration the Charter is to us. I refer in\r\nparticular to the noble and always relevant words of the\r\npreamble, whose implementation will be a constant\r\nchallenge to us in the course of the century to come.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Cape Verde for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Carlos Veiga, Prime Minister of Cape Verde,\r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Croatia, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mate Granić.\r\nMr. Granić (Croatia): Let me first extend sincere\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, as the new President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that your rich\r\ndiplomatic experience and the reputation you enjoy will\r\nplay an important role in leading the Assembly’s work.\r\nI would also like to give credit to Mr. Didier Opertti\r\nof Uruguay for the great skill and persistence he showed\r\nin presiding over the work of the fifty-third session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMay I also welcome the three new Member States of\r\nour Organization, Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga. The United\r\nNations is richer for their membership.\r\nWe are only one year away from the Millennium\r\nAssembly, an event whose symbolism should inspire us\r\nto strive harder to achieve all the goals of the\r\nOrganization. In looking forward to the challenges of the\r\nfuture, our countries also realize that the world continues\r\nto hold many dangers. It has been rightly said that\r\nglobalization has two faces. While accounting for an\r\nincreasingly complex web of linkages across the full\r\nspectrum of human endeavour, it has also led to increased\r\nalienation and, in some cases, disparity. Quite clearly, the\r\nUnited Nations is at the forefront of efforts to address and\r\nreconcile these complex processes. The struggle to raise\r\nand improve the quality of life of the hundreds of\r\nmillions who continue to suffer the anguish of poverty,\r\nthe protection of our precious environment, the\r\nstrengthening of democracy and the protection of human\r\nrights, responding effectively to natural disasters, further\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nprogress in disarmament and dealing properly with security\r\ncrises as they arise all continue to occupy us.\r\nHaving mentioned the issue of security, allow me to\r\nobserve that the situation in South-Eastern Europe has come\r\nfull circle with the return of the epicentre of the crisis to\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Kosovo, where it\r\nstarted more than a decade ago. The military intervention\r\nof the international community, supported by all the\r\ncountries of the region, including Croatia, must now be\r\nfollowed up with an appropriate political response. Just as\r\nwe joined the international community in condemning\r\nviolations of human rights, it is clear that energies must\r\nnow be concentrated on building a lasting and just peace.\r\nWith regard to the security issue of Prevlaka, as with\r\nother matters resulting from the aggression and territorial\r\npretensions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, bilateral\r\nnegotiations have been unsuccessful. The simple reason is\r\nthat the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia does not wish to\r\naccept Croatia\u0027s internationally recognized borders. Only\r\nwhen the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia accepts Prevlaka\r\nas a purely security-related issue instead of considering it\r\na territorial dispute, and refrains from abusing this issue in\r\ninternal Serbian-Montenegrin relations, will a solution be at\r\nhand. The opening of border crossings with the Republic of\r\nMontenegro has, by allowing for the freedom of movement\r\nof people and goods, significantly contributed to regional\r\nstability and helped the democratic transformation of\r\nMontenegro.\r\nCroatia has proposed the establishment of a bilateral\r\nsecurity regime as a follow-up to the present one\r\nadministered by the United Nations Mission of Observers\r\nin Prevlaka (UNMOP). Whether as a result of successful\r\nbilateral negotiations with the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, of a Security Council resolution or even of\r\nunilateral action consistent with the rights and duties of\r\nCroatia under international law, the UNMOP mandate\r\nshould be terminated soon. Further prolongation of the\r\nmandate will only serve those who wish to stall\r\nnegotiations indefinitely, which is contrary to good-\r\nneighbourly relations and the interests of stability in the\r\nwider region.\r\nThe key legal issue arising from the disintegration of\r\nthe former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nremains that of succession. As long as this matter is\r\nunresolved, the prospects for lasting normalization in the\r\nregion will be hampered for all the successor States.\r\nResponsibility for this state of affairs lies squarely with the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, which keeps rejecting the\r\nconclusions of the United Nations/European Union\r\nConference on the Former Yugoslavia, as well as the\r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Only if rooted in this existing body of\r\ninternational law and authority can the question of\r\nsuccession be resolved. Pending a full resolution of this\r\nissue, the normal economic processes that might\r\notherwise promote stability and cooperation cannot have\r\na positive effect, either on the region or on bilateral\r\nrelations.\r\nOver the past year, Croatia has persevered in its\r\ndetermination to enlarge and enrich the content and scope\r\nof its special bilateral relations with Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. I am particularly pleased to be able to\r\ninform the Assembly that we have recently resolved one\r\nof the hitherto open questions in our relations with Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina: an agreement has been signed settling\r\nthe issue of our common border.\r\nCroatia will continue both to support the\r\nimplementation of the Dayton agreements regarding\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and to maintain its commitment\r\nto ensuring the rights of the Croats, as the least numerous\r\nof its three constituent peoples.\r\nFollowing a slow initial response, there has been a\r\nproliferation of both national and multinational initiatives\r\nthroughout the second half of the 1990s aimed at ensuring\r\nlong-term stability in South-Eastern Europe. The new\r\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe builds upon the\r\nsound foundation provided by the prospect of the\r\ninclusion of the States of the region in the Euro-Atlantic\r\nintegration processes. However, its success will depend\r\nupon an individual evaluation of the progress being made\r\nby the respective States, an evaluation which should be\r\nbased upon simple, clear and transparent criteria.\r\nMy country has welcomed the Pact as an important\r\ndevelopment involving all the relevant international actors\r\nand seeking a comprehensive solution. In the view of\r\nCroatia, the strengths of the Pact — provided that it is\r\nimplemented to the letter — are, first, its\r\ncomprehensiveness and, secondly, its vision of integrating\r\nthe participating States into the Euro-Atlantic structures.\r\nIn this way, we hope that it will marshal the hitherto\r\ndispersed energies of the international community. Croatia\r\nlends its full support to the process related to the Pact and\r\nreiterates its determination to continue to take an active\r\nrole in its implementation.\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nThe joint success of the United Nations and the\r\nCroatian Government in peacefully reintegrating the\r\npreviously occupied part of eastern Croatia early last year\r\nhas been followed by the gradual return of displaced\r\npersons to their homes, not only in that region, but also to\r\nother areas of Croatia. It is a complex process involving the\r\nreturn of Croats to their homes in the previously occupied\r\nareas, and the return of Croatian Serbs to their homes from\r\nother countries and from eastern Croatia to other parts of\r\nthe country.\r\nWhile the difficult economic circumstances,\r\nparticularly in the areas of return, are certainly not helping\r\nthe process, they are affecting all citizens equally. In spite\r\nof these objective circumstances, the national Programme\r\nfor the Return and Accommodation of Displaced Persons,\r\nRefugees and Exiled Persons is being successfully\r\nimplemented and has resulted in the return of 65,000\r\nCroatian Serbs.\r\nCroatia maintains intensive relations with the\r\nInternational war crimes Tribunal for the former\r\nYugoslavia. It has taken numerous steps, from providing\r\ndocumentation and access to alleged crime sites to assisting\r\nin the voluntary surrender of indicted persons to the\r\nTribunal. Whenever a legal dispute has arisen, Croatia has\r\nsought ways of resolving it through proceedings within the\r\nTribunal Chamber itself. However, while it has lent its full\r\nsupport and cooperation to the Tribunal, Croatia is not fully\r\nsatisfied with the results to date. Indictments issued so far\r\ndo not adequately reflect the true nature and scope of the\r\nwar crimes committed by different sides in the conflict. The\r\nunusual delay in bringing persons in custody before the\r\ncourt — in some cases more than two years, despite the\r\ninitial assurances of speedy trials — has not strengthened\r\nthe Tribunal\u0027s credibility.\r\nNo one has been charged for the crimes committed\r\nagainst Bosnian Croats — despite assurances given as long\r\nago as the Dayton negotiations — and no one has been\r\nsentenced for crimes committed during the aggression\r\nagainst Croatia, despite ample evidence and 14,000 deaths.\r\nAllow me to repeat what I have said on previous\r\noccasions in this forum. The Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia continues to harbour the notorious war criminal\r\nMile Martic and the perpetrators of the most heinous war\r\ncrimes committed in Vukovar — Mrksic, Sljivancanin and\r\nRadic. Its stance overtly defies the will of the Security\r\nCouncil, the international community and justice in general.\r\nIt also poses a big obstacle to the reconciliation process.\r\nWe have witnessed tremendous advances during the\r\ntwentieth century. However, many challenges remain,\r\nparticularly if we are to eradicate poverty, protect our\r\nenvironment, and promote and achieve sustained social\r\ndevelopment and economic growth.\r\nThe recent important deliberations and work of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council have confirmed that the\r\nCouncil is an important forum for addressing the manifold\r\nissues arising from globalization. Croatia believes that\r\nimplementation of the negotiated outcomes in the broad\r\nsubject areas of sustainable development is the key to\r\npromoting the global agenda of leaving a healthy planet\r\nEarth for future generations to enjoy. The system of\r\ninternational conferences, now undergoing their five-year\r\nreviews, and the United Nations system as a whole, have\r\na leading role to play in this regard. It is with all these\r\nfactors in mind that Croatia has chosen the Economic and\r\nSocial Council as the first principal body to which to\r\npresent its candidature.\r\nOur hopes and goals for the future notwithstanding,\r\nthe world is still encumbered with the legacies of the\r\ntwentieth century. The scourge of war and all that violent\r\nconflicts bring with them are still a clear and ever-present\r\nconcern. The United Nations must be ready to cope with\r\nthese challenges. This inevitably requires reform of the\r\nOrganization. There is, of course, a broad consensus\r\nabout the need for reform, but as always, the devil is in\r\nthe details. The United Nations needs to have mechanisms\r\nat its disposal to address the issues arising from the new\r\ninternational order in a timely and efficient manner. The\r\nreforms within the competency of the Secretary-General\r\nare moving ahead. The Member States should now grasp\r\nthe symbolism of the new millennium in order to\r\nconclude the reform process.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council remains stalled.\r\nThe primary task of the Council, the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, makes its representation\r\nand transparency, and hence its reform, highly important.\r\nQuestions related to mine clearance and to the\r\ndestruction of anti-personnel and other types of mines are\r\na matter of special concern to Croatia. In spite of the fact\r\nthat much work is being done to alleviate this problem,\r\nhundreds of thousands of mines still lie scattered over\r\n6,000 square kilometres of Croatia\u0027s territory. Having\r\nratified the Ottawa Convention last year, Croatia was\r\npleased to host a regional conference on anti-personnel\r\nmines in Zagreb in July this year and thus share its\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nexperience and expertise directed at ridding the world of\r\nthese terrible weapons.\r\nThe United Nations is best known for its peacekeeping\r\nrole around the world. Croatia, which has hosted five\r\nseparate peacekeeping operations on its territory, has in\r\nrecent weeks taken on the role of a contributor of\r\npeacekeepers. As we have announced in the past, through\r\nits participation in the United Nations mission in Sierra\r\nLeone Croatia will now be able to repay in kind the good\r\ndeeds previously bestowed on it. The Croatian Government\r\nis honoured by this responsibility and is confident that its\r\nsoldiers will be exemplary members of the United Nations\r\nforce. Additionally, we welcome the evolutionary\r\ndevelopments in the area of peacekeeping, from the use of\r\ncivilian police and preventive forces to the “White\r\nHelmets” proposal.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights requires\r\nconstant vigilance and effort by all responsible\r\nGovernments. The Croatian Government, through its\r\nNational Committee for Human Rights Education, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and experts from the\r\nCouncil of Europe, is preparing a national programme on\r\nhuman rights education targeting schoolchildren at the\r\nprimary and secondary levels.\r\nCroatia continues to follow closely the progress being\r\nmade towards establishing an International Criminal Court.\r\nThe establishment of an efficient, permanent International\r\nCriminal Court will be a milestone in the march towards\r\nthe universal protection of human rights and the rule of\r\nlaw. Croatia has signed the Statute of the Court and looks\r\nforward to other States doing so, too, so that this great\r\nachievement of the international community can commence\r\nits operation as soon as possible.\r\nThe present session of the General Assembly will be\r\nvital in preparing for the coming Millennium Assembly. It\r\nis important that this Assembly be well prepared so that it\r\nis an event of substance rather than of ceremonial character.\r\nCroatia hopes that it will be a real crossroads and that it\r\nwill succeed in providing guidelines for a better and more\r\ntolerant world in the coming millennium.\r\nAllow me to conclude by noting that Croatia is\r\nlooking forward to the work of the fifty-fourth session,\r\nhopeful that it will bring further progress in addressing the\r\nchallenges and grasping the opportunities of our times.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet\r\nNam, His Excellency Mr. Nguyen Manh Cam.\r\nMr. Nguyen Manh Cam (Viet Nam) (spoke in\r\nFrench): On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist\r\nRepublic of Viet Nam and on my own behalf, I should\r\nlike to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. I am convinced that, thanks to your experience\r\nand wisdom, this session will have a successful outcome.\r\nI should like also to express my thanks and great\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for\r\nhis important contribution and the effectiveness of his\r\npresidency during the fifty-third session.\r\nI should also like to congratulate and warmly\r\nwelcome the three new States Members of the\r\nOrganization: the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. The Government and\r\nthe people of Viet Nam are pleased to greet those three\r\nPacific countries and to assure them of our willingness to\r\nestablish and develop fruitful and close cooperation.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is of\r\nspecial significance. As a bridge between the twentieth\r\nand twenty-first centuries, it will prepare us for entering\r\na new century and a new millennium. This is therefore an\r\nimportant moment, as it affords us the opportunity to take\r\nstock of the advent and evolution and the highs and lows\r\nof this greatest international Organization over more than\r\nhalf a century. Such an assessment will help us draw\r\nlessons and provide us with the necessary valuable\r\nexperience from which we can identify what needs to be\r\ndone so as to allow the United Nations to continue to\r\nplay its role and exercise its influence in the world today\r\nand in the future.\r\nThe twentieth century, which is drawing to a close,\r\nhas been marked by great achievements for humankind at\r\nevery level of its development, but it also requires us to\r\nreflect deeply about problems unforeseen in previous\r\ncenturies. Two world wars and hundreds of protracted\r\nconflicts, civil wars and situations of local tension in\r\nvarious regions of the world have claimed the lives of\r\nmore than 150 million people and left permanent scars,\r\nboth spiritual and physical, on hundreds of millions of\r\nothers. They have destroyed the creative achievements of\r\nmany generations, some of which was irreplaceable. That\r\nhas given human beings a deeper, more burning desire to\r\nlive in peace, security, freedom and happiness, and to\r\nachieve stable and sustainable development for the benefit\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nof humankind and our beautiful planet. The creation of the\r\nUnited Nations more than 50 years ago, with its clearly\r\ndefined statutes and objectives, contributed to the\r\nrealization of those aspirations. Indeed, during the twenty-\r\nfirst century humankind has witnessed extraordinary\r\nprogress in the decolonization process, the collapse of the\r\ncolonial system and the successful promotion of the sacred\r\nright of peoples to national self-determination, resulting in\r\nthe birth of many independent States and, therefore, in\r\nfundamental changes in international relations. The\r\nachievements of the United Nations over the past 54 years\r\nare due in large part to the contribution of those young,\r\nindependent countries.\r\nIn spite of the important progress made towards the\r\ndevelopment of nation States during the twentieth century,\r\nwe must acknowledge that humanity is confronted with\r\nmany unresolved problems. Over the past few decades of\r\nthis century, the explosion in science and technology,\r\nespecially in the field of information technology, has\r\nchanged the structure of many economies and profoundly\r\naffected the cultural and social life of every State. Our\r\nworld has become a global village, geographic distance is\r\nless of a factor than it used to be, and interdependence,\r\ninteraction and cooperation among States, regions and\r\ncontinents have continued to increase. It is unfortunate,\r\nhowever, that many of these achievements have not been\r\nused purely for the benefit humankind, but have been\r\nmisused or even used abusively against humankind. The\r\narms race, especially the development of nuclear weapons\r\nand other new weapons that are more and more\r\nsophisticated, dangerous and deadly weapons, is not only\r\ndraining significant resources but also threatening to destroy\r\npeople\u0027s lives and the environment.\r\nIn the past year, the situation in certain regions has\r\nfaced the international community with the challenge of the\r\npolitics of diktat practised by a group of countries and\r\nregional organizations. The unilateral military attacks\r\nagainst the territorial integrity of sovereign States in the\r\nBalkans and the Gulf have set a dangerous precedent in\r\ninternational relations, running counter to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations and in violation of the\r\nfundamental principles of international law, especially those\r\nof respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of Member States. This presented a serious\r\nchallenge to the role and effectiveness of the United\r\nNations, as well as to its legal foundations.\r\nThe first lesson to be learned from those events is that\r\nit is not possible for the United Nations to build or\r\nguarantee peace and security in the world at large or at the\r\nregional level unless international law and the United\r\nNations Charter are fully respected and strictly\r\nimplemented. Secondly, the United Nations can play the\r\nrole and exert the influence that is commensurate with its\r\nmagnitude only if, now as well as in the future, it\r\nsteadfastly upholds the purposes and principles defined at\r\nSan Francisco 54 years ago and carries out a thorough\r\nand in-depth reform of its organizational structure and\r\noperation, in order to imbue our Organization with inner\r\nstrength.\r\nBy so doing, the United Nations will be able to\r\nprevent any country or regional organization from using\r\na pretext, or a cause such as human rights, for example,\r\nto trample on the independence, sovereignty or territorial\r\nintegrity of another country or to interfere in its internal\r\naffairs. By so doing, the United Nations will be able to\r\npreserve its important role and to meet the expectations of\r\nMember States with respect to preventing policies of\r\ndiktat and the use or threat of use of force in international\r\nrelations. And by so doing, the United Nations will be\r\nable to help create and foster the climate of lasting peace\r\nand security that is needed for the solid, sustainable\r\ndevelopment that all Member countries need today and\r\nwill need in the coming century.\r\nToday, peace and security have a dialectical and\r\nconsistent link with development. Development has\r\nbecome an important element in the broadly accepted\r\nconcept of security. This has made every country more\r\nglobally relevant while making all States less isolated. It\r\nshould be no surprise that socio-economic development\r\nhas become the main focus of the policy of the majority\r\nof States and an area in which the United Nations will\r\ncontinue to have an important role to play.\r\nIt is undeniable that over the past decade the process\r\nof regionalization and globalization has transformed the\r\nworld and benefitted many countries. But the side-effects\r\nand adverse consequences of this trend have also been\r\nincreasingly evident. Obvious examples have indicated\r\nover the past two years that those consequences could\r\ndestroy the achievements of long years of development\r\nand could lead to instability, locally and on a broader\r\nscale. The first victims are none other than the least\r\ndeveloped countries: those that face the greatest\r\ndifficulties in their process of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment and that should have enjoyed greater\r\nattention and more favourable conditions in the process of\r\nregional and global integration. Those countries can and\r\nshould count on United Nation support as they engage in\r\nthis process.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nThe role of the United Nations is to promote\r\ninteraction among peace, security and development in order\r\nto ensure that globalization and regionalization will not\r\nevolve in a way that is incompatible with the needs, levels\r\nof development and specific conditions of each State and\r\neach region. Only then will nations be able to contribute to\r\nthat process and enjoy the legitimate and rightful benefits\r\nderived from it. Only then can equality be secured and the\r\npainful side-effect of this process, namely the widening gap\r\nbetween the rich and the poor, be addressed.\r\nDespite the striking progress we have made on the\r\nlong road of civilization, the end of the twentieth century\r\nis still marked by poverty and hunger, which are among the\r\ngravest tragedies and the greatest challenges facing\r\nmankind. Poverty and hunger not only lower living\r\nstandards in certain countries; they have become a global\r\nproblem, a factor for socio-political instability in many\r\nregions, and a problem that at present many countries\r\ncannot resolve by themselves. This problem will grow more\r\nserious if early efforts are not made to adequately address\r\nthe adverse consequences of globalization and\r\nregionalization. Over the past half century, the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies have made an active\r\nand effective contribution to the fight against hunger and\r\npoverty; they have gained a great deal of valuable\r\nexperience, of which the Organization should now make\r\ngreater use. The eradication of hunger and the alleviation of\r\npoverty have become a primary, pressing task for the\r\nUnited Nations. They also form part of the Organization\u0027s\r\nresponsibility towards Member countries that are now\r\nsuffering under these twin scourges.\r\nThe United Nations has set as a target the halving\r\nworld hunger and poverty by 2015. To this end, it is crucial\r\nthat every country\u0027s internal resources be mobilized, but\r\nexternal cooperation to create an enabling environment for\r\ndevelopment is equally important; it is, indeed,\r\nindispensable. We are convinced that the United Nations\r\ncould play an important role in promoting North-South\r\ncooperation by encouraging developed countries to expand\r\ndirect investment, provide and secure long-term financing,\r\nopen their own markets and grant preferential terms of\r\ntrade to developing and least developed countries, fulfil\r\ntheir commitment of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product for official development assistance,\r\npromote technology transfer, support human-resource\r\ndevelopment, vocational education and training and join\r\nother countries in implementing the 20/20 initiative on\r\nsocial development, especially the commitments embodied\r\nin the October 1998 Hanoi declaration on the 20/20\r\ninitiative. Such support by the United Nations will facilitate\r\nevery nation\u0027s efforts and will gradually and effectively\r\ntackle the issue of poverty and hunger.\r\nThe problems facing the United Nations at the turn\r\nof the century are large, complex and difficult. But, with\r\nthe benefit of the experience of 54 years, the support of\r\nMember countries and the opportunities that mankind has\r\ngenerated, the Organization will be able to tackle them if\r\nUnited Nations reform is accelerated and implemented at\r\nan early date. In this regard, we welcome the efforts of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to make the\r\nadministrative structure more effective and to cut\r\nunnecessary spending.\r\nWe consider that United Nations reform involves\r\nenhancement of the role of the General Assembly, the\r\nprincipal organ in which the vast majority of members of\r\nthe international community are represented, to reflect\r\nfully the principles of democracy and equality among\r\nMember States. Reform of the Security Council is the\r\nmost important part of the process. Viet Nam\u0027s consistent\r\nview is that the Security Council needs to be made more\r\nrepresentative by increasing the number of both\r\npermanent and non-permanent members and by bringing\r\nabout greater democratization, transparency and\r\naccountability. Viet Nam is of the view that an\r\nindispensable element of reform is that a representative of\r\nthe developing countries must be a permanent member of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nWith regard to the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil, we support those candidates, such as India,\r\nJapan and Germany, that have the capacity to make a\r\nmajor contribution to the work of that important organ. At\r\nthe same time, it should be stressed that the veto power\r\nshould be used only in accordance with the letter and the\r\nspirit of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\r\nViet Nam welcomes the encouraging prospects of a\r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts and tensions in certain\r\nregions of the world, such as the Great Lakes region of\r\nAfrica, and the resumption of the peace and reconciliation\r\nprocess in the Middle East. We follow with interest the\r\ndevelopments in East Timor and hope that there will be\r\nno further complications, so that the situation there can be\r\nstabilized soon, thus contributing to peace and stability in\r\nthe region. Viet Nam calls for an early and complete end\r\nto the policy of embargo and blockade against Cuba and\r\nother countries. Such policies are not only outdated, but\r\nrun counter to current trends towards democratization and\r\nequality in international relations, causing damage and\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nsuffering to the populations of the countries concerned,\r\nespecially women, the elderly and children.\r\nIn South-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region the\r\neconomic recovery in many countries over the past year has\r\nrestored confidence in the future. The countries of the\r\nregion have learned lessons, found effective solutions and\r\ntaken full advantage of assistance from the international\r\ncommunity. As a result, the growth rate has gradually\r\nrecovered; exports, cooperation and investment have step by\r\nstep been revitalized. However, full economic recovery and\r\novercoming the adverse impact of the crisis to ensure\r\nsustainable development is a continuing, long-term process,\r\na challenge that the countries of the region must take up.\r\nThe Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN) has taken new steps forward. The success of its\r\nsixth summit, held in Hanoi in December 1998, and the\r\nadmission of Cambodia, which means that all 10 countries\r\nof the region are now members, have demonstrated a high\r\nlevel of unanimity and the determination and capacity of\r\nthe ASEAN countries to promote solidarity, expand\r\ncooperation and overcome difficulties to give the group its\r\nappropriate role, status and strength. ASEAN with 10\r\nmembers is now better placed to make its voice heard in\r\ninternational and regional forums, such as the ASEAN\r\nRegional Forum (ARF), the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation (APEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, on\r\nregional and global problems pertaining to peace, security,\r\ndevelopment and the survival of humankind.\r\nMaintaining peace and security in Asia in general, and\r\nin South-East Asia in particular, remains a shared concern\r\nof all member States. We hope that countries outside the\r\nregion, especially the nuclear-weapon States, will cooperate\r\nwith the South-East Asian countries for the implementation\r\nof the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone\r\n(SEANWFZ) Treaty. This Treaty, which came into effect\r\nin 1997, reflects the keen desire of the South-East Asian\r\ncountries for peace and security in the region, and their\r\nserious commitment to the disarmament goal of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world. We are pleased to note, and greatly\r\nappreciate, the support for the Treaty expressed by China\r\nand Russia.\r\nWhen referring to the situation in the region, one\r\ncannot fail to mention the situation in the Eastern Sea —\r\nthe South China Sea — where there are still incidents that\r\ncause concern to the countries of the region. Viet Nam\r\nbelieves that disputes in that sea should be settled by\r\npeaceful means, through bilateral and multilateral\r\nnegotiations between the parties directly concerned, with\r\nrespect for international law, especially the 1982 United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1992\r\nDeclaration of ASEAN Foreign Ministers on the South\r\nChina Sea. While seeking a lasting solution, all the parties\r\nconcerned should exercise self-restraint, refrain from any\r\nact that may further complicate the situation and take\r\nconfidence-building measures to ensure regional peace\r\nand stability, thus facilitating the search for fundamental,\r\npermanent solutions. In this regard, ASEAN\u0027s current\r\nefforts to draw up a code of conduct in the South China\r\nSea, in accordance with the spirit of the sixth ASEAN\r\nsummit, held in Hanoi, are a step in the right direction\r\nand a constructive measure, contributing to confidence-\r\nbuilding and the peaceful settlement of disagreements in\r\nthe region.\r\nAs a Member of the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community, Viet Nam has done its utmost,\r\nand will continue to do so, to contribute to the common\r\nwork of humankind. Viet Nam\u0027s consistent position is to\r\npursue an independent, sovereign foreign policy, seeking\r\nthe multilateralization and diversification of external\r\nrelations, with regional and global integration. It wishes\r\nto be the friend of all the members of the international\r\ncommunity struggling for peace, independence and\r\ndevelopment. Viet Nam is an active member of ASEAN\r\nand APEC and is preparing to join the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) as soon as possible.\r\nViet Nam\u0027s diplomatic activities have been founded\r\non the achievements recorded over the past 12 years in\r\nour work of national reconstruction, the industrialization\r\nand modernization of the country to achieve our goal of\r\na wealthy people, a strong State and a just and advanced\r\nsociety. We have maintained a high rate of economic\r\ngrowth, reduced the poverty rate from 30 per cent in 1992\r\nto 15.7 per cent at the end of 1998, and created more than\r\na million jobs each year. These are tangible proofs of our\r\neconomic and social development. The United Nations\r\nand its specialized agencies have greatly contributed to\r\nthis achievement, as was acknowledged at the conference\r\nto review cooperation between Viet Nam and the United\r\nNations development bodies, held in Hanoi two years ago.\r\nFurthermore, Viet Nam has, as a member of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme/United Nations Population Fund\r\nExecutive Board, played an active part in the joint\r\nundertakings of the international community.\r\nViet Nam highly appreciates the role played by the\r\nUnited Nations in international life, both today and for\r\ntomorrow. It will make its contribution to the\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nOrganization\u0027s activities and will join other Members in\r\nrebuilding and renewing the United Nations so that it can\r\nlive up to the expectations of Member States and their\r\npeoples, and meet the demands of our time.\r\nDuring its more than five decades of existence as the\r\nworld\u0027s largest international body the United Nations has\r\nmade fundamental contributions to humankind\u0027s\r\ndevelopment in all areas and has created a legal framework\r\nfor international relations. What the United Nations has\r\nachieved to date will come with us into the new century,\r\nalong with the conviction that it will contribute to new\r\nachievements, to further progress and the resolution of\r\noutstanding differences between nations. While placing a\r\ngreat deal of hope in the United Nations, the Member\r\nStates also understand that its effectiveness depends on the\r\nactive participation of all of them.\r\nLooking back over the path we have travelled, we now\r\nappreciate more than ever the role of the United Nations\r\nand its capability, as well as the complexity and tenacity of\r\nthe problems before it. We can reaffirm that the United\r\nNations — when it has been reformed on both the\r\norganizational and institutional levels and its objectives\r\nhave been adjusted — will remain an irreplaceable\r\norganization. The fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly is entrusted with a great mandate: to complete\r\nthe necessary preparations so that the United Nations can\r\nenter a new stage in its development.\r\nAllow me to express from this rostrum our great\r\nconfidence in the capability and crucial role of the United\r\nNations to promote peace, security, cooperation and\r\ndevelopment for a better future for mankind. In this regard,\r\nViet Nam pledges to work closely with other Member\r\nStates to contribute actively to this noble cause, the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Kenya, His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Bonaya Adhi Godana.\r\nMr. Godana (Kenya): May I, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. Kenya\u0027s pride in seeing you preside over the affairs\r\nof the Assembly, which you have been associated with for\r\nso long, derives from our close and long bilateral ties with\r\nyour great country.\r\nI take this opportunity to register my delegation\u0027s\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Didier\r\nOpertti of Uruguay, for the able manner in which he\r\npresided over the work of the fifty-third session.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for the effective and tireless manner in which he\r\ncontinues to manage the affairs of this Organization and\r\nencourage him to continue serving the international\r\ncommunity with his characteristic selfless dedication to\r\nduty. Kenya will continue to support his efforts to further\r\nstrengthen the Organization.\r\nKenya warmly welcomes the Republics of Kiribati\r\nand Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga into this family of\r\nnations.\r\nAs we approach the new millennium, there is need\r\nfor us to reflect on the past, the present and the future of\r\nour world. The cumulative history of mankind during the\r\ncurrent millennium has been characterized by the struggle\r\nof the human race to overcome the various problems of\r\nhunger, war and disease. Throughout time man has\r\ninvested constantly to provide shelter, increase literacy\r\nand tackle the various problems of underdevelopment.\r\nThe latter part of this millennium has witnessed enormous\r\npolitical, economic and social changes. Where once\r\nslavery was acceptable, today freedom is the norm. Where\r\nonce crude methods of economic production dominated,\r\ntoday sophisticated production techniques govern. Where\r\nignorance was widespread, today science and technology\r\ndetermine man\u0027s progress. Where before the human rights\r\nof peoples were unknown, today they are an integral part\r\nof the international agenda.\r\nBut even as we note the progress that has been\r\nmade, the scourge of poverty and underdevelopment\r\nremains a painful reality for most of us. We believe that\r\npoverty is the root cause of the conflicts that pervade\r\nvarious regions of our globe, unleashing immense\r\nsuffering on humankind — particularly on women and\r\nchildren.\r\nOur continent, Africa, continues to suffer from the\r\nravages of intra-State and inter-State conflicts. The issue\r\nof the complementarity of the roles of the United Nations\r\nand that of regional organizations needs to be addressed.\r\nAfrican countries have taken their own initiatives to\r\nresolve the various conflicts raging in the continent.\r\nAlthough progress has been made in some cases, many of\r\nthe conflicts remain intractable, making it difficult for\r\naffected countries to redirect their efforts and resources\r\ntowards economic development.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nIn our own region, together with other members of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\r\nKenya is seized with the conflicts in Sudan and Somalia.\r\nThe subcommittee on the Sudan peace process, for\r\nexample, is actively engaged in the search for a peaceful\r\nsettlement to the conflict in the southern Sudan. At the\r\nmost recent meeting, held in Nairobi from 19 to 23 July\r\n1999, members of the IGAD ministerial subcommittee\r\nagreed to establish a secretariat to facilitate intensive and\r\ncontinuous negotiations to resolve this conflict. As\r\nchairman of this subcommittee, Kenya is optimistic that this\r\nnew arrangement will contribute positively towards reaching\r\na negotiated settlement. We hope we can count on the\r\nsupport of all the members of the international community\r\nto find a solution to this long-standing conflict.\r\nKenya continues to be seized with the situation in\r\nSomalia. As a neighbour that shares a border of 1,200\r\nkilometres with Somalia, we are concerned at the loss of\r\ninternational interest and support for this sad country. The\r\ninternational community should resume its active interest\r\nand support for Somalia in order to instill in the innocent\r\npeople of that country some measure of hope for the future.\r\nWe are grateful for the roles that the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity and the United Nations have played and\r\ncontinue to play. However, Kenya calls for greater\r\ninvolvement by the United Nations in support of ongoing\r\nregional efforts. The new initiative unveiled by the\r\nChairman of IGAD, President Guelleh of Djibouti, at this\r\npodium on 22 September 1999, deserves serious\r\nconsideration.\r\nIn efforts to support and assist the people of Somalia,\r\nthe territorial integrity of that country must be respected.\r\nRegional entities that may have come into existence during\r\nthis period in Somalia\u0027s history should be seen as building\r\nblocks intended to eventually lead to a Government of\r\nnational unity. We the neighbouring countries, as well as\r\nthe international community, have an important role in\r\nfacilitating the process leading to a peaceful and\r\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict. Our common\r\ncommitment to a united Somalia should not waver.\r\nIn the tradition of African hospitality, Kenya has\r\nalways provided a home to displaced people from\r\nneighbouring countries. As a result of the collapse of the\r\ncentral authority in Somalia, a large number of refugees\r\nfound their way into our country. We are proud to have\r\nbeen able to assist and even settle some of them. In this\r\nregard, we are grateful for the role being played by the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\r\nUnited Nations Children\u0027s Fund, the World Health\r\nOrganization and many others who have provided\r\ninvaluable assistance, without which it would have been\r\nimpossible for the Government of Kenya alone to cope\r\nwith the humanitarian crisis.\r\nRecently, Kenya decided to tighten its border\r\ncontrols with Somalia. However, we remain committed to\r\nfacilitating ongoing humanitarian operations, which\r\ncontinue with numerous daily flights into Somalia from\r\nour territory — and, in some cases, by land as well. We\r\nhave been able to do this by coordinating our actions with\r\nthe relevant humanitarian agencies and organizations.\r\nThe crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nremains of utmost concern to us because it poses a\r\nserious threat not only to the Great Lakes region but also\r\nto the rest of our continent. It is for this reason that\r\nKenya has been involved in the attempts to resolve the\r\nconflict, particularly in its early, initial stages. Kenya\u0027s\r\noffer to host in Nairobi the proposed Congolese national\r\ndebate on the political future of their country still stands.\r\nWe commend the recent personal efforts that President\r\nChiluba of Zambia has made in negotiating a settlement\r\nplan which seeks to find a comprehensive solution to that\r\ncrisis. We will do everything possible to complement\r\nthese efforts and hope that the international community\r\nwill be prepared to fulfil its own supporting role.\r\nAs the international community continues to play its\r\npart, the responsibility for a final, comprehensive and\r\nlasting settlement to the crisis in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo falls largely to the people and their leaders.\r\nIn that regard, Kenya urges all parties to the Lusaka\r\nAgreement to demonstrate their commitment by\r\nimplementing it, both in letter and in spirit, in a timely\r\nand appropriate manner.\r\nWe firmly believe that it is time for the Security\r\nCouncil to actively step in and provide tangible support\r\nfor the peace process. Africa expects that the support\r\ngiven to peacekeeping operations in other parts of the\r\nworld will be replicated, both in scope and in content, in\r\nthe case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We\r\nknow that most members of the Security Council have\r\nembraced this challenge and are willing to do their part.\r\nThe situation in Angola continues to be a source of\r\ngreat frustration. Indeed, the resumption of hostilities at\r\na level not seen since the signing of the Lusaka Protocol\r\ndoes not augur well. Kenya is deeply disappointed that\r\nthe leader of UNITA, Mr. Savimbi, continues to\r\nflagrantly defy the collective will of the international\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\ncommunity. We call on him to immediately cease all acts\r\nof hostility against the people of Angola.\r\nWith regard to the border conflict between Ethiopia\r\nand Eritrea, we note with satisfaction that the combined\r\ninitiatives of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the\r\nUnited Nations and the United States to secure definitive\r\nagreement on the modalities for the implementation of the\r\nOAU Framework Agreement are still on course. We appeal\r\nto both parties to exercise utmost restraint and not to\r\nresume fighting.\r\nIn accordance with the United Nations Charter, the\r\nSecurity Council has the primary responsibility to determine\r\nthe existence of any threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity and to recommend appropriate intervention\r\nmeasures. There can be no derogation from this primary\r\nresponsibility. In the fulfilment of this responsibility, it\r\nmust be borne in mind that the principle of non-interference\r\nin the internal affairs of Member States remains a cardinal\r\nelement in the conduct of international relations, as spelt\r\nout in the Charter.\r\nWe have serious reservations on the evolving view\r\nthat even the United Nations Charter provides leeway for\r\nnon-United Nations intervention. We would like to caution\r\nthat this approach needs to be carefully balanced with\r\nlegitimate concerns of sovereignty. Whatever we may say\r\non intervention, the sovereignty of States remains at the\r\ncore of diplomatic discourse. Derogation from this principle\r\nin the case of serious humanitarian emergencies must be\r\nmade on the basis of general consensus in the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Kenya has always supported and\r\nparticipated in many United Nations peacekeeping missions\r\nthroughout the world. We will continue to contribute\r\npersonnel and remain actively involved in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping activities. All peacekeeping missions must be\r\nestablished in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\r\nThis is why we welcome the assumption of responsibility\r\nin Kosovo by the United Nations in the form of the United\r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\r\n(UNMIK). We should do everything possible to support\r\nefforts towards the restoration of normalcy in Kosovo. We\r\nalso hope that the spirit that prevailed in the establishment\r\nand financing of UNMIK will be applied to peacekeeping\r\noperations in Africa.\r\nMr. Bovah-Kamon (Côte d\u0027Ivoire), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nWith regard to the situation in East Timor, Kenya\r\ncommends Indonesia for allowing the international\r\ncommunity to send a United Nations — mandated\r\nmultinational force to restore order. We welcome the\r\nunequivocal statement by the Foreign Minister of\r\nIndonesia, Mr. Ali Alatas, reiterating his Government\u0027s\r\nresponsibility to ensure the fulfilment of the newly\r\nexpressed will of the majority of East Timorese to seek\r\na new destiny outside the Indonesian Republic. We hope,\r\nas he expressed the hope, that the parting of ways will, in\r\nhis own words, proceed honourably, peacefully and\r\namicably.\r\nAs Sierra Leone continues along the path of national\r\nreconciliation and true peace, we encourage the United\r\nNations to remain committed to and engaged in that\r\ncountry. We again place on record our appreciation to the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) for its immense sacrifice\r\nin assisting the people of Sierra Leone in their search for\r\npeace and democracy. On our part, we will continue to\r\nsupport our brothers and sisters in that country. Towards\r\nthat end, we have already contributed personnel to the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone\r\n(UNOMSIL).\r\nKenya is encouraged by the recent positive\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process. The\r\nresumption of direct dialogue between the State of Israel\r\nand the Palestinian National Authority, which resulted in\r\nagreement on the implementation of aspects of the Wye\r\naccords, demonstrates the vast opportunities that political\r\ngoodwill can unleash. We encourage those involved to\r\nstay on course and we welcome indications that the other\r\ntracks in the Middle East peace process are receiving\r\ncareful attention.\r\nOn the economic front, my delegation is of the view\r\nthat the slow progress in Africa\u0027s efforts to attain\r\nsustainable economic growth and development is directly\r\nrelated to the failure by the international community to\r\nmobilize adequate resources for development. This has\r\nbeen aggravated by situations of internal conflict and the\r\nprevalence of such diseases as malaria and AIDS, among\r\nothers, which are compounded in turn by the shackles of\r\npoverty and deprivation and an unfavourable external\r\neconomic environment.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative made at the G-8 meeting\r\nin Cologne, Germany. The crushing burden of external\r\ndebt on the developing countries, especially those in sub-\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nSaharan Africa, remains a major obstacle to our\r\ndevelopment efforts. While we welcome this Initiative, we\r\nare of the view that much still needs to be done. We would\r\nlike to see HIPC coverage broadened to include more of the\r\nindebted countries, with relief being offered in a graduated\r\nmanner. This would envisage providing the greatest relief\r\nto the most indebted countries. In addition, consideration\r\ncould be given to modifying the existing terms and\r\nconditions of HIPC to enable countries like Kenya, not\r\ncovered by HIPC as currently proposed, to participate\r\nwithout the possibility of losing access to credit that would\r\notherwise be available to them. The terms and conditions of\r\nthe HIPC Initiative are based on a piecemeal approach\r\nwhich will not contribute to the overall goal of debt\r\ncancellation. Debt-relief measures should be structured in\r\na holistic and comprehensive manner without eroding\r\nAfrica\u0027s future capacity to attract investments and should be\r\nlinked to the long-term social and economic development\r\nof the continent.\r\nAnother issue that requires the concerted efforts of the\r\ninternational community is that of poverty eradication.\r\nKenya has already launched a Poverty Eradication Plan,\r\nwhich has received some support and which we hope will\r\nattract wider support to allow us to achieve our goal of\r\nbecoming a newly industrialized country by the year 2020.\r\nBold actions are required to ensure that the developed\r\ncountries fulfil the commitments agreed upon to maintain\r\nofficial development assistance flows to developing\r\ncountries at 0.7 per cent of their gross national product. In\r\nthis regard, Kenya supports the proposal to hold an\r\ninternational conference on financing for development next\r\nyear.\r\nThe United Nations remains our only hope to\r\nspearhead the process of development. Accordingly, all\r\nMember States have an obligation to support the\r\nOrganization in order for it to fulfil its development\r\nmandate. The United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) and other specialized bodies — such as the United\r\nNations Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF), the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\r\n(UNHCR), the United Nations Environment Programme\r\n(UNEP) and the United Nations Centre for Human\r\nSettlements (Habitat) — must be strengthened in order to\r\nenable them to succeed in their respective roles.\r\nKenya looks forward to the convening of the first\r\nSouth-South summit in Havana, Cuba, in April next year.\r\nThe conference will be a historic milestone in the\r\nstrengthening of South-South cooperation. The South-South\r\nsummit provides a golden opportunity at the highest\r\npolitical level for the members of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina to share their experiences and to consolidate\r\npolitical goodwill, which is so vital for economic\r\ncooperation and development.\r\nKenya attaches great importance to economic\r\ncooperation among developing countries. It is for this\r\nreason that Kenya has actively pursued the path of\r\neconomic integration at the regional and subregional\r\nlevels. In addition to the Common Market for Eastern and\r\nSouthern Africa (COMESA), comprising 21 countries\r\nwith a population approaching 400 million, we are\r\ndetermined, at the subregional level, to upgrade the East\r\nAfrican cooperation arrangements — comprising Kenya,\r\nUganda and Tanzania — into a full-fledged East African\r\ncommunity by the end of the year. Our vision is to\r\nestablish an East African community with a population of\r\nnearly 90 million people with natural, historic, social and\r\ncultural ties into one investment destination, one tourist\r\ndestination, one single market and one common external\r\ntariff, with a free flow of goods, services and people.\r\nKenya is greatly concerned by the rise in\r\ntransnational crime, narcotics, money-laundering and\r\nterrorism networks. The tragic bombing of the embassies\r\nof the United States of America in Nairobi and Dar-es-\r\nSalaam in August 1998 is still fresh in our memories.\r\nThis incident, not to mention the recent terrorist attacks\r\nin Moscow, has heightened our resolve to work closely\r\nwith the international community to fight and eradicate\r\nterrorism. We call for concerted efforts to adopt effective\r\ninternational measures to eradicate the growing and\r\ndangerous links between terrorist groups, drug traffickers\r\nand armed criminal elements. Towards this end, Kenya\r\nparticipated actively in the Algiers summit of OAU in\r\nJuly 1999, at which African States adopted a convention\r\non preventing and combating terrorism. Clearly, more\r\nneeds to be done. We support the proposal to hold an\r\ninternational conference next year on combating terrorism.\r\nKenya is situated in the heart of a turbulent region.\r\nThe proliferation of illegal small arms and their increased\r\ncriminal use on Kenyan territory, often by groups from\r\nacross our borders, is motivating us to push for practical\r\nand sustained international cooperation to stop illegal\r\ntrafficking in small arms. In this connection, we express\r\nour support for the convening of an international\r\nconference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects to be\r\nheld by the year 2001.\r\nIn our own region, Kenya will host a meeting before\r\nthe end of this year to address the complex problems of\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nsmall arms and their ramifications for security and conflicts\r\nin our region. We look forward to the support and\r\ncooperation of our development partners to ensure that this\r\nconference is a success.\r\nOn this issue, Kenya would like to draw a clear\r\ndistinction between the legitimate rights of sovereign States\r\nto self-defence and therefore to the procurement of\r\narmaments for that purpose, and the illicit traffic in small\r\narms involving non-State actors.\r\nKenya welcomes the urgency and importance with\r\nwhich the international community has recently addressed\r\nthe problem of antipersonnel landmines. We participated\r\nactively in the negotiations leading to the Ottawa\r\nConvention on anti-personnel landmines and in the recent\r\nMaputo Conference of States Parties to the Ottawa\r\nConvention. We have signed the Ottawa Convention, which\r\nis now going through the ratification process. The\r\nprevailing international consensus on outlawing landmines\r\nmust be maintained in order to achieve the target of a total\r\nban on the production, use and eventual elimination of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines. International cooperation is essential\r\nin the areas of landmine clearance and the physical\r\nrehabilitation of victims, as well as their social and\r\neconomic rehabilitation and reintegration.\r\nAs we celebrate the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law, Kenya regards the adoption of the\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court as a historic\r\nmilestone in the progressive development of international\r\nlaw. We participated actively in the negotiations leading to\r\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute, became the eighty-fourth\r\nState to append our signature to it and have embarked on\r\nthe ratification process for it.\r\nWe look to the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nInternational Criminal Court to elaborate on the outstanding\r\nissues, including the elements of crime and the rules of\r\nprocedure, in order to reach an early consensus and ensure\r\nuniversal acceptance of the Statute. We hope that the\r\nPreparatory Commission will complete its work before the\r\nJune 2000 deadline.\r\nAs eloquently stated by the Secretary-General, reform\r\nof the United Nations is a process and not an event. In\r\norder to attain a more transparent, accountable and\r\ndemocratic United Nations, the collective resolve of its\r\nMember States is imperative. We must resist any attempts\r\nto approach the reform process in terms of downsizing:\r\nreform must entail restructuring to cope better with the\r\nimmense economic development challenges facing our\r\nworld, and the success of the reform effort must be\r\nmeasured in terms of the Organization\u0027s capacity to\r\ndeliver programmes, strengthen the Secretariat, enhance\r\nits strategic orientation and use the development dividend\r\nto enhance socio-economic development in all our\r\ncountries. In this context, Kenya welcomes the\r\nappointment of Dr. Klaus Töpfer as Director-General of\r\nthe United Nations Office at Nairobi. As host to the only\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in the developing world, we\r\ncontinue to be greatly concerned by the underutilization\r\nof the excellent conference facilities at the United Nations\r\nOffice at Nairobi. Practical plans are urgently required to\r\nplace the Nairobi Office on the same level as the United\r\nNations Offices at Geneva and Vienna by providing it\r\nwith adequate resources and personnel to enable it to\r\ncarry out its functions effectively.\r\nThe changes that have taken place in international\r\nrelations need to be reflected in the composition and\r\nstructure of the Security Council. The Security Council is\r\na body that is empowered to make important executive\r\ndecisions on matters of peace and security on behalf of\r\nthe entire membership of the United Nations. It is\r\nimperative that the reform of the Security Council should\r\nensure greater accountability and democracy together with\r\nequitable representation. The universal and democratic\r\nnature of the United Nations should be preserved and\r\nreforms introduced to ensure fair representation of all the\r\nmajor geographic regions of the world.\r\nA strong and persuasive case has been made by\r\nAfrican countries for at least two seats in the permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council. Our recent\r\nexperience as a nonpermanent member of the Council has\r\nconvinced us of the urgency of restructuring this\r\nimportant organ so that developing countries can play\r\ntheir rightful part in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nKenya is of the view that sanctions should be\r\nimposed only in accordance with the Charter and only\r\nafter all means for the pacific settlement of disputes under\r\nChapter VI have been exhausted. A thorough study of the\r\nshort- and long-term effects of sanctions, especially on\r\ninnocent victims, should be undertaken. The objectives of\r\nsanctions should be clearly defined and the sanctions\r\nshould be lifted as soon as those objectives have been\r\nachieved. Sanctions should be imposed for a specified\r\ntime, and the conditions to be met by the country or party\r\non which sanctions are imposed must be clearly defined\r\nand subjected to periodic review. We reject any attempts\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nto impose or prolong the application of sanctions for\r\nreasons other than the specified objectives.\r\nThe application of sanctions usually has profound\r\neffects not only on the target countries but also on their\r\nneighbouring countries and other trading partners. Efforts\r\nshould therefore be made to put Article 50 of the Charter,\r\nwhich refers to third States, into operation by establishing\r\nmechanisms or Funds to provide them with relief. In this\r\nregard, Kenya urges that the sanctions on Iraq should be\r\nurgently reviewed with a view to their suspension and\r\neventual lifting. We also hope that the sanctions on Libya,\r\nrecently suspended, will soon be lifted.\r\nAs we enter the twenty-first century, it is hard to\r\nimagine what this world would be without the United\r\nNations. Consider for a moment the number of lives that\r\nhave been saved by the Organization; the personal freedoms\r\nthat many countries and individuals now enjoy; and the\r\ndiseases that have been controlled or eliminated: the list of\r\nsuccesses is endless. But much still needs to be done: the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s proposal for a Millennium Assembly,\r\nwith a millennium summit as an integral part, would\r\nprovide an important forum for us to reexamine the role of\r\nthe Organization and chart our path for the next\r\nmillennium. Kenya will play its part.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I call on the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland, Mr. David\r\nAndrews.\r\nMr. Andrews (Ireland): Mr. President, I congratulate\r\nyou, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. Your experience as the Namibian people\u0027s chief\r\nrepresentative in New York during your country\u0027s struggle\r\nfor independence and your role in guiding Namibia into the\r\nfamily of nations will serve you well in directing the\r\nimportant work of this session.\r\nOur thanks are also due to Foreign Minister Opertti of\r\nUruguay for his dedicated efforts in leading the Assembly\r\nover the past 12 months. I, too, would like to warmly\r\nwelcome our three new Members to the United Nations, the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga.\r\nIn January of this year, my Government had the\r\nprivilege of hosting a visit by Secretary-General Annan. As\r\nthe first United Nations Secretary-General to emerge from\r\nwithin the international civil service, his personal\r\ncommitment to the United Nations and its founding\r\nprinciples is evidenced in his efforts to steer the\r\nOrganization into the new millennium.\r\nMy colleague Foreign Minister Halonen of Finland\r\nset out the views of the European Union on the main\r\nchallenges facing the international community today, and,\r\nof course, Ireland fully associates itself with our respected\r\nFinnish Presidency\u0027s remarks.\r\nThe responsibility of the United Nations to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security has been severely tested\r\nthis year. In Africa, in the Balkans and, most recently, in\r\nEast Timor, we have seen bloody and vicious outbreaks\r\nof violence which could have been avoided. At the same\r\ntime, the incidence and scale of natural disasters has\r\nincreased, adding to the pressures facing the already\r\noverstretched relief agencies. We need to take up the\r\nchallenge which the Secretary-General set out in his\r\nthought-provoking address earlier this week — to think\r\nanew about how the United Nations and the Member\r\nStates respond to the political, human rights and\r\nhumanitarian crises affecting so much of the world. We\r\nare all haunted by the collective failure to prevent\r\nhumanitarian disasters — including genocide — as well\r\nas the outbreak of conflict in many regions.\r\nThe case for better prevention strategies is\r\noverwhelming. Even the costliest policy of prevention is\r\nfar cheaper, in lives and resources, than the least\r\nexpensive use of armed force. It is simply unacceptable\r\nthat the United Nations should be starved of the resources\r\nthat are vital to this conflict prevention. Where conflict\r\nprevention fails, more fundamental questions relating to\r\ncapabilities for crisis management arise. How is it\r\npossible, for example, that the international community\r\nfinds itself repeatedly incapable of taking effective action?\r\nHow has it come to pass that questions are being raised\r\nabout the adequacy of the Charter itself? Or that the\r\nconstraints impairing the effectiveness of the Organization\r\nhave led to searching elsewhere for effective response? It\r\nis indeed a paradox that, in a world of unprecedented\r\ninterdependence and technological capabilities, we should\r\nbe confronted by such a dilemma.\r\nThe Charter, I think, has been fairly described as a\r\n“living document”. I believe that this provides the key to\r\nresolving our dilemma. We have not used sufficiently the\r\npossibilities that already exist under the Charter, not only\r\nin the area of peace and security, but also in the social\r\nand economic fields. I would suggest that we should\r\nscrutinize its provisions and use them imaginatively. That\r\ncould make possible a reinvigoration of the United\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nNations, injecting a new sense of purpose and a new\r\ndynamic.\r\nI believe we should similarly look to see how we can\r\nsupport the Secretary-General in his immense labours. His\r\nreport on the work of the Organization has diagnosed\r\naccurately the challenges that exist and has genuinely\r\npointed out what needs to be done. He has powers under\r\nthe Charter, and he should be encouraged to use them to\r\nthe full. Greater empowerment of the Secretary-General is\r\none practical step that we, the Member States, should take.\r\nWe should seize the opportunity provided by the\r\nMillennium Assembly next year to reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to the goals and principles set out in the\r\nCharter, in a pragmatic, action-oriented and forward-looking\r\nmanner.\r\nWe can learn, as has been said by previous speakers,\r\nfrom the crisis in East Timor. As the Personal\r\nRepresentative of the European Union Presidency, I\r\nwitnessed at first hand the consultation process on 30\r\nAugust. I wish particularly to pay tribute to the outstanding\r\nwork of the United Nations Mission in East Timor\r\n(UNAMET). It has received criticism, and I reject that\r\ncriticism. I saw the work at first hand. They were an\r\nunarmed force — a group of very brave men and women.\r\nMen and women of my own country were among that very\r\nbrave group of people, and I salute them.\r\nIreland, together with our European Union partners, is\r\nfully committed to seeing that the people of East Timor\r\nenjoy the independence which they have freely chosen. The\r\npoll itself took place peacefully in a fair and free\r\nmanner — we witnessed it first hand — and reflected, as\r\nI understand it, the views of the people. It was, however,\r\nfollowed by systematic and ruthless attacks on the\r\npopulation. We have condemned these atrocities in the\r\nstrongest terms. The perpetrators of crimes against\r\nhumanity must be brought to justice. The United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary\r\nRobinson, has called for an international commission of\r\ninquiry, and, of course, we all fully support this, as I\r\nunderstand it.\r\nHad those seeking to frustrate and overturn the process\r\ninitiated by President Habibie last January succeeded, they\r\nwould have denied the democratic rights of the people of\r\nEast Timor, posing a very serious challenge to the\r\ncredibility and authority of the United Nations. I welcome\r\nthe decisive action taken by the Security Council which led\r\nto the adoption of its resolution 1264 (1999), although I\r\nregret that this action could not have been taken more\r\nspeedily. I pay sincere tribute to all involved, and in\r\nparticular to the members of the Security Council mission\r\nwho went to Jakarta and Dili in very very difficult\r\ncircumstances. I pay sincere tribute to all involved. All of\r\nthe provisions of Security Council resolution 1264 (1999)\r\nmust now be fully implemented in all respects, as it says,\r\nand as is required by it.\r\nWe fully support the deployment of the international\r\nforce for East Timor under the leadership of Australia.\r\nIreland is among the contributors to this force.\r\nWe are facing a humanitarian disaster in both East\r\nand West Timor. All East Timorese refugees, wherever\r\nthey are, must be allowed to return to their homes. The\r\nresponse that is now being made will go some way to\r\nrestoring the credibility and authority of this Organization\r\nat a time when the restoration of that credibility and\r\nauthority is so urgently required. In Ireland we will be\r\ncontinuing to support, in every way we can, the work of\r\nthe United Nations and, of course, the international\r\nhumanitarian agencies in East Timor.\r\nThe dilemma which I earlier described is also\r\nillustrated clearly by the response to crises in many parts\r\nof Africa, as has been outlined by so many other\r\nspeakers, and by the previous speaker in particular, my\r\ncolleague Foreign Minister Godana of Kenya. This\r\nresponse has in the past been totally inadequate, leading\r\nin turn to further conflict, human suffering and neglect on\r\nan even greater scale.\r\nI welcome the steps recently taken towards national\r\nreconciliation in a number of the African countries,\r\nincluding, as was mentioned by the previous speaker,\r\nSierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe patient diplomacy and determination of individual\r\nAfrican leaders has laid the groundwork for the resolution\r\nof a number of recent conflicts. We received a timely\r\nreminder of these efforts a few days ago from President\r\nChiluba of Zambia in his excellent address to the Security\r\nCouncil. But these efforts deserve and require the support\r\nand commitment of the international community. The\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report on conflict prevention in Africa\r\nhas set out clear goals and proposals on the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa, and\r\nwe must all ensure that real progress is achieved on these\r\nissues.\r\nCountries emerging from conflict situations, in\r\nparticular, face the need to rebuild lives and livelihoods.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nMany of these are among the poorest Member States. In\r\nthat context, I wish to highlight the extent of the debt\r\nburden on developing countries, particularly on the heavily\r\nindebted poor countries — the so-called HIPC countries.\r\nServicing this debt deprives many of these nations of scarce\r\nresources, resources which are required to meet the most\r\nbasic human needs, and some of the debt repayments based\r\non the moneys given to some of these countries are nothing\r\nshort of disgraceful.\r\nThe launch of the joint World Bank/International\r\nMonetary Fund Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative\r\ntwo years ago gave hope that substantive action would at\r\nlast be taken to relieve the debt crisis, particularly the large\r\nand growing burden of multilateral debt. Some progress has\r\nbeen made, but, unfortunately again, in the nature of those\r\ninstitutions — and I do not say it by way of great criticism\r\n— there is a slowness in their movement. That is why the\r\nInitiative has benefited so few of the countries to which it\r\nis directed. We need to extend it to more countries, with a\r\ngreater degree of flexibility, and maybe a little bit of\r\nimagination.\r\nIreland wishes to see the strongest possible link\r\nbetween debt relief and poverty alleviation. It is the poorest\r\nand most marginalized who have borne much of the burden.\r\nI saw this in recent visits to a number of these countries in\r\nAfrica. We recognize the strength of international concern\r\nabout the debt of poor countries, including the urgent\r\ndemands for debt forgiveness. The Irish Government\r\ndecided last year to direct resources to both bilateral and\r\nmultilateral debt relief, and also to make it integral to\r\nIreland\u0027s overall development cooperation strategy. The goal\r\nof poverty reduction, the primary focus of this strategy,\r\ncannot be met without concerted international action to\r\nstem the haemorrhage of resources caused by this burden.\r\nIreland regrets the decline in flows of official\r\ndevelopment assistance to what can only be described as\r\nhistoric lows. This situation must be reversed. Developing\r\ncountries, especially the poorest among them, need\r\ninternational solidarity now more than ever.\r\nThe forthcoming special session on small island\r\ndeveloping States is an important opportunity to focus\r\ninternational attention on countries with which Ireland has\r\na natural affinity. Remote from major markets and\r\necologically fragile, they face the twin challenges of\r\nglobalization and climate change. Ireland recognizes their\r\nunique situation and supports further work on an index\r\nwhich would reflect their vulnerability.\r\nThe special session should give a renewed impetus\r\nto the Barbados Programme of Action — a Programme\r\nthat I salute. The small island States, particularly the\r\npoorest, must not be further marginalized. For our part,\r\nwe have placed a new emphasis on small island\r\ndeveloping States in our multilateral aid programme. We\r\nare also working with our partners in the European Union\r\nand the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries towards\r\na successful conclusion — a just and equitable conclusion\r\n— of the post-Lomé negotiations.\r\nThe scourge of drug trafficking is a global problem\r\nwhich affects us all. Ireland is fully committed to the\r\nfight against drugs and to supporting the efforts of those\r\ncountries which are already very much affected by this\r\nheinous traffic.\r\nFull respect for human rights is of fundamental\r\nimportance to the achievement of all our other goals. As\r\nthis millennium draws to a close, a series of the most\r\nbarbaric violations of human rights imaginable in Bosnia,\r\nRwanda, Kosovo and now in East Timor are testaments\r\nto our inhumanity to one another.\r\nThe Secretary-General has produced a compelling\r\nreport (S/1999/957) to the Security Council on the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict. We must\r\naddress, with the utmost speed and seriousness, the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s recommendations which are aimed at\r\ncreating, in his words, a “climate of compliance” with\r\ninternational human rights and humanitarian standards, as\r\nset out. The Secretary-General has rightly placed great\r\nstress on the necessity to enhance efforts aimed at conflict\r\nprevention. His recommendations offer us an opportunity\r\nto redeem the pledges we made last year on the occasion\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nIt is imperative that the Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court enter into force as soon as possible. A\r\nglobal enforcement mechanism which addresses impunity\r\ncould also serve as a deterrent to genocide and crimes\r\nagainst humanity, some of which I have just articulated.\r\nIreland will shortly assume the chairmanship of the\r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, an\r\nimportant political forum for enhancing democratic values\r\nand stability throughout the continent of Europe. We will\r\nseek to promote further cooperation between the Council\r\nof Europe and the United Nations in areas of common\r\ninterest.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nThe shadow of nuclear weapons hangs over us all as\r\nwe enter the new millennium. We can no longer remain\r\ncomplacent at the absence of progress towards the early\r\nelimination of nuclear arsenals. The limited steps that have\r\nbeen taken to date — which we welcome — do not amount\r\nto a determined process of elimination.\r\nIntent on securing a new consensus on the way\r\nforward, I and my colleagues from Brazil, Egypt, Mexico,\r\nNew Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden last year\r\nlaunched an initiative called “Towards a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree world: the need for a new agenda”.\r\nWith the adoption of a resolution on the new agenda\r\nin the General Assembly, the international community has\r\ndemanded a clear perspective for the closure of the nuclear-\r\nweapons era.\r\nThe approach of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) 2000 Review Conference\r\nunderlines the imperatives of a fundamental change in\r\napproach. We require a new commitment on the part of the\r\nnuclear-weapon States. This would make the elimination of\r\nthese weapons an immediate objective rather than an\r\nultimate goal.\r\nEarlier this year I had the honour of participating in\r\nthe first meeting of the States Parties to the Ottawa\r\nConvention, held in Maputo. The conclusion of the global\r\nban on landmines is, of course, one of the striking\r\nachievements of our time. In this I salute the leadership of\r\nCanada, working with determined Governments, including\r\nmy own, and in cooperation with the non-governmental\r\ncommunity. It is the clearest demonstration of what can be\r\nachieved when the political will exists.\r\nThe spread of small arms and the consequences for\r\ncivilian populations in armed conflict must be confronted\r\nnow. This traffic in arms is an obscenity and, in many\r\ncases, totally and absolutely irresponsible; its brokers know\r\nno morality. We must redouble our efforts to address both\r\nthe supply and demand sides of a threat to the security of\r\ncivilians that has reached epidemic proportions.\r\nWe in Ireland are proud of our contribution to world\r\npeace through peacekeeping. Just under a year ago Ireland\r\nbecame a full participant in the United Nations standby\r\narrangements system. We currently contribute to eight\r\npeacekeeping operations, with over 700 personnel in the\r\nfield. Our largest commitment is to the United Nations\r\nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon.\r\nOur service has not, of course, been without cost. To date\r\n78 Irish peacekeepers have paid the highest price in the\r\nservice of the United Nations.\r\nThe changing and more complex nature of\r\npeacekeeping involves additional tasks, such as\r\nhumanitarian assistance, the protection of human rights\r\nand civilian police work. Through our participation in the\r\nmultinational forces operating under United Nations\r\nauthorization in Kosovo, and soon in East Timor, Ireland\r\nis already playing its part in these new arrangements. Our\r\ncommitment to United Nations peacekeeping remains, as\r\never, strong, steadfast and loyal.\r\nI will conclude by giving a short resume of the\r\nsituation in Northern Ireland. A number of speakers have\r\nreferred to the peace process in Northern Ireland during\r\nthe course of their contributions to this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and I very deeply appreciate their\r\nremarks in that regard. Their support and, indeed, all the\r\nsupport of all the nations in the United Nations is very\r\ndeeply appreciated.\r\nI will now turn to the evolving situation in that part\r\nof my benighted land, Northern Ireland. When I spoke\r\nhere last year, I was honoured to be the first Minister to\r\nbe able to report that a comprehensive and broadly based\r\npolitical accommodation had been reached, that is, the\r\nGood Friday Agreement of April 1998. The Agreement\r\nwas reached by the British and Irish Governments and by\r\neight political parties in Northern Ireland following almost\r\ntwo years of intensive negotiations. It was subsequently\r\nendorsed by the people of the island with decisive\r\nmajorities in referendums held in both the north and\r\nsouth, an average between the two parts of the island in\r\nthe nature of 72 per cent for a permanent peace on the\r\nisland of Ireland and in favour of the Good Friday\r\nAgreement. As I say, it was subsequently endorsed by the\r\npeople of the island with a decisive majority in a\r\ncombined context, which I have just spoken about,\r\nnamely, referendums in the north and south. The\r\nAgreement covers not just constitutional issues and\r\npolitical institutions, but a wide range of other matters\r\nessential to conflict resolution and the promotion of a fair\r\nand just society.\r\nAll of us gathered here know, often from direct\r\nexperience, that, though it can be hard to reach an\r\nagreement, it is often harder still to implement it. I doubt\r\nvery much if anyone in Ireland expected the path ahead\r\nto be smooth and straight. While very substantial progress\r\nhas been made, there continue to be frustrations and, of\r\ncourse, difficulties, and I would not seek to minimize the\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nproblems we face. But there is still much that is valuable\r\nand encouraging.\r\nIt is true that the peace we have remains imperfect,\r\nand there can be no tolerable or acceptable level of\r\nviolence. In places, tensions between the two communities\r\nare worryingly high. But, overall, Northern Ireland is more\r\npeaceful than it has been at any time for a generation.\r\nRelationships between the two parts of Ireland, and between\r\nBritain and Ireland, are closer and more relaxed than they\r\nhave ever been. And the longer it continues, it is peace\r\nwhich becomes the norm. The people were always entitled\r\nto peace. My belief is that now they are coming to expect\r\nit. I am confident that no attempt to return to the full-scale\r\nviolence of the past would win any meaningful support or\r\ncould be sustained for long. We have turned the corner and\r\nthere can be no going back.\r\nDuring the past year, much good work has been done\r\nto carry the Agreement forward. For instance, its human\r\nrights and equality provisions are being given concrete\r\neffect, as are measures to promote cultural equality and\r\nreconciliation and to assist the victims of violence. The\r\nindependent commission established under the Agreement\r\nto make recommendations on a new beginning to policing\r\nin Northern Ireland has recently produced an excellent and\r\nthorough report on this very sensitive and important issue.\r\nThe Irish Government looks forward to playing our part in\r\nits implementation.\r\nMoreover, the Governments and the parties in the\r\nnorth have completed all of the preparatory technical work\r\nnecessary to establish the new political institutions\r\nenvisaged by the Agreement. You can understand,\r\ntherefore, the disappointment we feel that it has not yet\r\nproved possible actually to establish those political\r\ninstitutions. While there is disagreement among some\r\npolitical parties on the precise relationship between the\r\nformation of an inclusive executive within Northern Ireland\r\nand the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, there is\r\nno difference of view on the desirability of both objectives.\r\nHowever, there is a persistent mutual distrust and lack of\r\nconfidence, with doubts about future intentions continuing\r\nto linger.\r\nUnder the dedicated and committed leadership of the\r\nTaoiseach — my Prime Minister, Mr. Bertie Ahern — and\r\nthe British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, the Irish and British\r\nGovernments and all the parties have devoted enormous\r\nenergy to the task of seeking to find a generally acceptable\r\nway forward. But so far, despite some progress, we have\r\nnot succeeded in bridging that particular gap. For that\r\nreason, we have invited Senator George Mitchell of the\r\nUnited States, who chaired with such skill and judgement\r\nthe talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement itself,\r\nto act as a facilitator of a review. That review is now\r\nunder way. There is no good reason why it should fail. I\r\ncannot believe that is in the interests of anyone that it\r\nshould fail.\r\nThe institutional blueprint sketched out in the\r\nAgreement and endorsed by the people offers the only\r\nrational basis for a lasting peace and for reconciliation\r\nthrough practical partnership and common action. No\r\nother conceivable course of action represents a remotely\r\nsatisfactory alternative. Whatever the short-term\r\ndifficulties, the Irish Government, in continued\r\ncooperation with the British Government, will not cease\r\nto work for its implementation.\r\nIt is not surprising that the stalemate of the past\r\nmonths has led to some doubt and, indeed,\r\ndisillusionment. But I am convinced that there remains a\r\nhuge reservoir of support for the Agreement within both\r\nthe unionist and nationalist communities, provided each\r\ncan be confident that all aspects will be implemented in\r\nfull. People are open to persuasion if a reasonable\r\naccommodation is on offer. There is therefore an onus on\r\nall political representatives to be generous and creative\r\nand to be prepared to offer leadership to their own\r\nconstituencies while reaching out to others — not\r\nrecklessly, but courageously and honourably.\r\nI am convinced that there will be no return to our\r\noften bitter past. But it will be possible to realize the full\r\npotential of the future only when the Good Friday\r\nAgreement is implemented as a totality. The Agreement\r\noffers a bold and generous vision of tolerance and\r\npartnership between those who together share the island\r\nof Ireland. Moreover, it offers a framework within which\r\nprofound differences can be accommodated without\r\ncoercion and on the basis of consent. Those of us from\r\nwithin the Irish nationalist tradition value the unionist\r\ntradition. We have come to understand, to cherish and to\r\nrespect its authenticity and, of course, its validity. It is a\r\nvital and irreplaceable strand of that diversity of cultures\r\nand identities which makes up Ireland as it really is.\r\nAll over the world, we can see the tragic\r\nconsequences of policies of domination and exclusion.\r\nThe future of Ireland can be, should be and, I believe,\r\nwill be radically different. That is why the task of\r\nimplementing the Agreement should be completed now,\r\nand not left to another generation.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nIn conclusion, as we go forward we know that we\r\nretain the support and solidarity of the international\r\ncommunity. In this regard I would like to pay particular\r\ntribute to the role of the United States and, of course, of\r\nPresident Bill Clinton, who has stood steadfastly beside us\r\nthroughout the historic process in which we have been\r\nengaged. As always, we are deeply grateful for the\r\nencouragement of all of our friends, which is and will\r\ncontinue to be hugely important to us.\r\nAs we benefit from the support of the international\r\ncommunity, I wish in turn to pledge Ireland\u0027s continuing\r\ncommitment to the fulfilment of the aims and principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The next\r\nspeaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation\r\nof the Republic of Benin, Mr. Kolawolé Idji.\r\nMr. Idji (Benin) (spoke in French): In taking the floor\r\non behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Benin, I\r\nwould like first of all to express my heartiest\r\ncongratulations to the entire Bureau of the fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I would also like to\r\nexpress my satisfaction at seeing the Foreign Minister of\r\nNamibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, presiding over the\r\nAssembly at this session, the last of the century and of the\r\nclosing millennium.\r\nAt a time when the United Nations more than ever is\r\ncalled upon to act in the interest of the peace and well-\r\nbeing of humankind, Benin takes pride in seeing a\r\nrepresentative of Africa holding that important post. I\r\nwould assure him of my delegation’s full cooperation and\r\nsupport, for it will be under his enlightened presidency that\r\nthe Organization will stride forward into the twenty-first\r\ncentury. We see this felicitous and remarkable coincidence\r\nas a definite assurance of the success of the important\r\ndebates we will be holding and a sign of hope that the\r\ndecisions to be taken will so direct our actions as to ensure\r\nthat the coming century is one of peace, progress and\r\ndevelopment, for the African continent in particular.\r\nAllow me at this stage to pay tribute to Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, for the\r\noutstanding work he did in the service of the Organization\r\nthroughout the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nI wish also to pay a highly deserved tribute to our brother,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, for the unstinting devotion that he has\r\ndemonstrated since his election and for the undeniable\r\nsuccesses that he has achieved for the United Nations in\r\nparticularly difficult circumstances.\r\nI should like here to reaffirm the full support and\r\nconfidence of the Government of Benin as we pursue the\r\nlofty and legitimate goal of giving the United Nations the\r\nmeans of tackling the challenges that await us on the\r\nthreshold of the first century of the new millennium.\r\nI should like also to congratulate and warmly\r\nwelcome the three new States Members of the United\r\nNations — the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is beginning\r\nat a particularly important moment in the history of\r\nhumankind, for, after a century of deeds and events\r\nfraught with all kinds of consequences, the entire\r\ninternational community is preparing to move forward\r\ninto the first century of a new millennium. We who have\r\nbeen privileged to witness this twofold historical\r\ntransition should not ignore the great responsibility that\r\nwe have borne throughout the century that is now closing\r\nand the equal responsibility that we will have to shoulder\r\nthroughout the one that is about to begin.\r\nThe challenges that face us are many and range\r\nacross all human areas of activity. It is our conviction that\r\nif we so desire, we can make the next century an era of\r\npeace, security, development, understanding and concord\r\namong peoples. In order to do this, we will have to\r\npromote and strengthen worldwide cooperation, in\r\nparticular in tackling the serious problems that the century\r\nthat is now ending will have bequeathed to the one that\r\nis now beginning.\r\nCombating poverty should, it seems to me, be one of\r\nour priorities, because poverty is a factor of\r\ndestabilization and a source of conflict and war,\r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nThe holding of the millennium summit in September\r\n2000 will be a historic opportunity for us to strive to\r\nstrengthen peace, security and stability, for which all\r\npeoples of the world yearn.\r\nWe could hardly overemphasize the close\r\nrelationship among development, peace, security,\r\ndemocracy and human rights, and we all share the\r\nresponsibility of day by day translating these words into\r\nreality. We can overcome poverty.\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nThe international community is in a position to put an\r\nend to the atrocities and the savagery that have been on the\r\nrise recently in all continents. To this end, it is essential for\r\nthe process of revitalization, restructuring and\r\ndemocratization in the world Organization, begun under the\r\nauthority of the Secretary-General, to be continued so as to\r\nenhance its effectiveness in carrying out the urgent tasks\r\nthat it will face at the beginning of the third millennium.\r\nBenin is at peace within its borders, with its\r\nneighbours and with the whole of the international\r\ncommunity. But we are seriously disturbed by the appalling\r\nconflicts that continue to devastate and destabilize our\r\ncontinent.\r\nWe are ready to continue to support the efforts of\r\nAfrica itself and those of the great Powers in the context of\r\nthe prevention, settlement and sustainable management of\r\nconflicts.\r\nHere I wish to pay tribute to the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and certain subregional organizations\r\nsuch as the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity for their bold initiatives aimed at bringing\r\npeace and security to Africa.\r\nI have no wish to forget or to minimize the\r\ncontribution of other countries, but I wish in particular to\r\npay tribute here to the tremendous sacrifices made by the\r\npeoples of West Africa and in particular by the people of\r\nNigeria in the context of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG) to help the West African subregion to put an\r\nend to war and insecurity, which hamper development and\r\neconomic progress.\r\nI wish also to welcome the bold resolutions adopted\r\nby the Heads of States at the OAU Summit in Algiers, as\r\nwell as the initiatives of the subregional organizations in\r\nWest Africa and in the Great Lakes region, which attest to\r\nstrengthened political resolve to reverse the course of\r\nevents in a positive and constructive direction. These\r\nendeavours deserve to be sustained and strengthened by\r\ninternational solidarity.\r\nThe example of Kosovo is there to remind us of the\r\nkey importance of prompt and determined action on the\r\npart of the international community in order to restore and\r\nmaintain peace. The distressing events in East Timor are\r\nanother eloquent example of this.\r\nAllow me in all honesty to state here that human\r\nrights are universal and indivisible. If we wish to build a\r\nunited and peaceful international community, let us not\r\nintroduce into the defence, protection and promotion of\r\nhuman rights any conditionalities or preferences, be they\r\ngeographical, cultural, geostrategic or others.\r\nIn this age of rapid globalization, we must realize\r\nthat the risk of marginalizing the weakest economies and\r\nthe most vulnerable peoples is very real; it is a mortal\r\ndanger. Fortunately, there is still time to avert it. If we\r\nare to succeed, our vision for the twenty-first century and\r\nour prospects for the future must be clarified and\r\nstrengthened by the effective implementation of the\r\nvarious plans and programmes of action adopted since the\r\nbeginning of this decade within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nIn this context, the situation of the developing\r\ncountries, the least developed countries in particular,\r\ndeserves more attention from the international community,\r\nwhich should endeavour to create favourable conditions\r\nfor those countries to develop. In this respect, we cannot\r\nevade the anguished question of the future of Africa on\r\nthe threshold of the third millennium, particularly given\r\nthe debt burden and the deterioration in the terms of\r\ntrade. These are sad realities which are killing at least as\r\nmany people as are dying from AIDS.\r\nFortunately indeed, Africa can cease to be the\r\ncontinent of bad news. Today, it has the ability and the\r\nwill to make it so. Throughout the decade that is now\r\ndrawing to a close, the international community has\r\nrepeatedly stated that Africa must be a priority. Mindful\r\nof the need for that continent to achieve economic\r\nprogress, the United Nations has worked out appropriate\r\nstrategies and embarked on specific development\r\nprogrammes. But none of those initiatives will have any\r\nimpact on the development of the continent if African\r\ncountries themselves, supported by their development\r\npartners, do not redouble their efforts to carry out the\r\nnecessary reforms and mobilize the necessary resources.\r\nWhile we clearly reaffirm our own responsibility, we\r\nmust also say that for Africa better economic performance\r\nnecessarily involves a rapid and lasting solution to the\r\nproblems caused by external debt; inputs of the new and\r\nadditional financial resources required to meet the\r\ngrowing need for funding; transfers of new and\r\nappropriate technology; promotion of a genuine, open and\r\nfair system of international trade; and appropriate\r\nincentives for our efforts to diversify and modernize our\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\neconomies. What we need in this age of globalization is a\r\ngenuine solidarity pact.\r\nThis new partnership with Africa should set out to\r\nenable all African countries to enjoy the benefits of\r\nglobalization. This implies mobilizing and pooling the\r\nefforts of the whole international community, inspired by\r\nthe same vision of a common destiny and a new philosophy\r\nof sharing. That vision of development prompted the\r\nGovernment of Benin to host, in February 1999 in Cotonou,\r\na conference of United Nations Development Programme\r\nResident Representatives working in Africa to consider the\r\nproblems of development in Africa in the coming\r\nmillennium. The conference identified the major problems\r\nthat African countries face at the close of the twentieth\r\ncentury: social and political upheaval; poverty; problems of\r\naccess in meeting essential social needs; population\r\npressure; the debt burden; and economic marginalization,\r\namong others. The conference also highlighted the assets\r\nand potential of the continent: significant natural and human\r\nresources; cultural wealth; a spirit of sharing; and a sense\r\nof solidarity.\r\nAccordingly, the conference recommended another\r\napproach for Africa\u0027s development, based on the promotion\r\nof peace and security within and between States; real\r\nintegration of Africa into the world economy; and the\r\ncreation of an African regional observatory for\r\nglobalization. It would be regrettable if these highly lucid\r\nand relevant analyses and findings came to nothing because\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme itself is stifled\r\nby a lack of resources.\r\nIn keeping with those recommendations, Benin,\r\ntogether with several other African countries, has\r\nundertaken far-reaching political and economic reforms to\r\nimprove the living and working conditions of its people,\r\nparticularly those in rural areas. The measures include\r\naction to stabilize public finances, liberalize the economy,\r\ndevelop the private sector, stimulate economic growth,\r\ncombat corruption and preserve social peace and political\r\nstability through the establishment of a State based on the\r\nrule of law that respects democratic principles and\r\nfundamental rights and freedoms.\r\nAgainst that background we are striving, tirelessly and\r\nresolutely, to ensure that the democratic process takes firm\r\nroot in Benin. Our young democracy has just successfully\r\ncompleted an electoral process culminating in the renewal\r\nof Parliament before the deadline set by the Constitution. In\r\na few months\u0027 time we will be holding local elections to\r\nelect mayors and councillors to help entrench democracy\r\nat the grass-roots level.\r\nHowever, despite these significant efforts and\r\nsacrifices, we know that our political and economic\r\nstructures will continue to be fragile and vulnerable so\r\nlong as poverty and disease continue to lay waste to our\r\ntowns and countryside, so long as HIV/AIDS is not\r\nconquered or, at least, contained at the same levels as in\r\nEurope and America, and so long as insecurity and\r\nappalling internal and regional conflicts continue to undo\r\nthe work of the African peoples and enrich a few arms\r\nmanufacturers and traffickers.\r\nI should like to extend the recognition and gratitude\r\nof the people and Government of Benin to all its\r\ndevelopment partners, to the Powers which have realized\r\nthat today poverty more than ever is a matter for all of\r\nus, wherever it may be found, and that violations of\r\nhuman rights involve us all wherever they may take\r\nplace. I wish once again to express our thanks to all those\r\nwho are assisting us in our activities aimed at making\r\nBenin, indeed Africa in general, a haven of peace,\r\npolitical stability and successful, integrated development.\r\nDuring its fifty-first session, the General Assembly\r\naccepted Benin\u0027s offer to hold the Fourth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies and\r\nencouraged it to do so, no doubt because of our efforts,\r\nwhich I have just outlined, to maintain peace, democracy\r\nand the constitutional rule of law. I am convinced that the\r\nfourth International Conference of New or Restored\r\nDemocracies — the first that Africa will have the honour\r\nand privilege of hosting, following the conferences held\r\nin the Philippines, Nicaragua and Romania — will be an\r\nopportunity for all the friends of Africa — indeed, all the\r\nfriends of democracy — to pool their experience and to\r\nwork together to consolidate a political system that,\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nunfortunately, is not yet the most widespread of\r\nphenomena. The Cotonou conference, scheduled for early\r\nDecember 2000, can have significance and impact only if\r\nall democrats agree to make a sincere contribution; this\r\nwould enable democracy all over the world to take a crucial\r\nqualitative leap forward.\r\nFor this reason, I fervently appeal to all those of\r\ngoodwill, and to all development partners eager that\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law and good governance should be\r\nsolidly established in every one of our States and on all\r\ncontinents, to lend their material and financial support and\r\ntheir experience to the preparation, organization and\r\nconvening of the Cotonou conference. We earnestly hope\r\nthat the Cotonou conference will enable us to build on\r\nexisting achievements in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nPeace, security and sustainable human development\r\nare the themes that my delegation would like to see as the\r\nbanner of this session of the General Assembly, the last\r\nbefore the year 2000: peace above all, so that the founding\r\ncry of this Organization, “never again”, may in the new\r\nmillennium become a reality for all peoples and for all\r\nindividuals.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I call next\r\non the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, His\r\nExcellency Mr.Alfred Mubanda.\r\nMr. Mubanda (Uganda): On behalf of the delegation\r\nof Uganda, I should like to congratulate His Excellency Mr.\r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab and all the Vice-Presidents on their\r\nelection to guide the deliberations of the General Assembly\r\nat its last session of this century. I also thank the President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session for the\r\neffective manner in which he discharged his responsibilities.\r\nAllow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts on behalf\r\nof the United Nations, especially in the area of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nUganda is pleased to welcome to membership of the\r\nUnited Nation the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nAt the end of this turbulent century and on the eve of\r\nwhat my delegation hopes will be a more peaceful and\r\nprosperous new century, the United Nations stands out as\r\nthe best hope for the future of humankind, international\r\ncooperation and solidarity. Uganda believes that a strong\r\nand effective United Nations is the best guarantor of\r\nworld peace and the most effective instrument to prevent\r\nanother world war. My Government is therefore\r\ndetermined to play a constructive role in ensuring that the\r\nUnited Nations of the twenty-first century will be\r\nincreasingly dedicated to the noble principles and\r\npurposes enshrined in the Charter. Those principles and\r\npurposes, which have stood the test of time, must\r\ncontinue to serve the peoples of the world and guide this\r\nworld Organization.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the\r\neconomic situation in Africa and the living conditions of\r\nthe vast majority of Africans are a cause of concern for\r\nmy delegation. By virtually any standard, the African\r\ncontinent remains marginalized. The statistics for the\r\ncontinent are dismal. With slightly over 10 per cent of the\r\nworld\u0027s population, sub-Saharan Africa accounts for a\r\nmeagre 1.5 per cent of world trade. The region receives\r\nless than 0.6 per cent of total foreign direct investment.\r\nCoupled with this is the fact that Africa\u0027s export earnings\r\nhave been on the decline due to a significant decrease in\r\nthe demand for primary commodities; Africa\u0027s terms of\r\ntrade have not improved; a crushing debt burden and a\r\nserious lack of capacity to generate domestic savings have\r\nworsened the economic situation. These negative trends\r\nhave increased the dependence of most sub-Saharan\r\nAfrican countries on official development assistance, but\r\nofficial development assistance itself has also been on the\r\ndecline, falling from 0.33 per cent of the combined gross\r\nnational product of donors members of the Organization\r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development in 1992 to\r\n0.22 per cent in 1998. This is a far cry from the 0.7 per\r\ncent target agreed upon by the international community in\r\nthe early 1970s.\r\nThe current state of economic globalization indicates\r\nthat Africa remains the least integrated continent and the\r\nmost marginalized economically. Africa has effectively\r\nbeen locked out of the benefits accruing from\r\nglobalization. The challenge before the international\r\ncommunity is to adopt and implement, as a matter of\r\nurgency, concrete measures to mitigate the negative\r\nconsequences of globalization on African economies. The\r\nUnited Nations must take the lead in efforts to restructure\r\nthe international monetary system to make it more\r\nresponsive to the plight of African and other developing\r\ncountries. Uganda believes that fundamental restructuring\r\nof the present international economic system is essential\r\nto transform the world from a mere constellation of\r\nwealthy cities surrounded by a galaxy of abject poverty\r\ninto a truly global village.\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nThe pivotal role played by transnational corporations\r\nin this inequitable economic system demands that the\r\nUnited Nations play a more active role in our collective\r\nefforts to regulate the activities of these powerful non-state\r\nactors. My delegation would like to propose the revival of\r\nthe United Nations Centre on Transnational Corporations\r\nand the United Nations Commission on Transnational\r\nCorporations for that purpose. The increasing control and\r\ndominance exercised by global corporations over the world\r\neconomy has serious consequences for many of us. It is\r\ntime Governments, and not multinational corporations, set\r\nthe international agenda for economic cooperation and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nI would like to underscore Uganda\u0027s commitment to\r\nuphold the tenets of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms. We believe in the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights and all other international human rights\r\ninstruments. At the national level, Uganda has incorporated\r\nthe universal principles of human rights into the basic law\r\nof the country, and we are committed to the principles of\r\ngood governance, transparency and accountability.\r\nThe world is aware of the great debate taking place in\r\nUganda about the process of our democratization. In\r\naccordance with our Constitution, the people of Uganda\r\nwill exercise a free choice to determine their system of\r\ngovernance in a referendum next year. I take this\r\nopportunity to invite observers and others who may wish to\r\nwitness the referendum to do so when the time comes.\r\nWith regard to internal conflicts, Uganda has granted\r\na blanket amnesty to all who lay down their arms and\r\nbecome part of civil society. An amnesty Bill is before our\r\nParliament, and in a very short time will be passed into\r\nlaw.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not emphasize Uganda\u0027s\r\ncommitment to the observance, in the region, of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. In 1994 the world was\r\nwitness to genocide in Rwanda in which an estimated 1\r\nmillion people were massacred. A similar act was about to\r\nbe perpetrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in\r\nthe course of 1997 and 1998. Apart from our legitimate\r\nconcerns about our national security and territorial integrity,\r\nUganda finds it unacceptable that gross violations of the\r\nright to life should again be carried out in its\r\nneighbourhood or anywhere else in the world.\r\nIt is vital for all of us to recognize the sanctity of the\r\nright to life. We are glad to note that the evolution of\r\ninternational law on human rights no longer condones\r\ngenocide under the guise of non-interference in a\r\ncountry\u0027s internal affairs. The principle of non-interference\r\nin the internal affairs of States has been so fundamentally\r\neroded that the international community should now\r\nopenly adopt a definitive convention which will permit\r\ninstant intervention in cases of massive threats to the right\r\nto life.\r\nIn July 1998 the United Nations Conference of\r\nPlenipotentiaries overwhelmingly adopted the Statute for\r\nthe establishment of an International Criminal Court.\r\nUganda has consistently identified itself with the entire\r\nprocess which culminated in the adoption of the Court\u0027s\r\nStatute. It was to many a triumphant moment for those\r\nhitherto yearning for a world in which individual persons,\r\nregardless of their socio-economic or political attributes,\r\nwould be held personally accountable for acts or\r\nomissions resulting in genocide, war crimes and crimes\r\nagainst humanity. At present work is under way in the\r\nPreparatory Commission for the Court to define\r\naggression as a core crime. Once the Statute comes into\r\nforce, it holds humanity\u0027s best hope for a new world legal\r\norder under which nobody, however high or low, can\r\nengage in horrendous crimes with impunity.\r\nWe urge the international community to support our\r\nefforts in the Great Lakes region focused on stopping,\r\naverting and reversing progression towards further chaos\r\nand restoring peace. Such support must include real\r\nimprovement of the socioeconomic wellbeing of our\r\npeoples through debt cancellations, promotion of\r\ndemocratic governance, adherence to sustainable human\r\nrights standards and, above all, strengthening our regional\r\nconflict- resolution mechanisms, peacemaking and peace-\r\nbuilding initiatives.\r\nThroughout this year world attention has been\r\nrepeatedly drawn to the fact that citizens of the world are\r\nabout to enter a new millennium. I would like to share\r\nwith the Assembly Uganda\u0027s expectations for the new\r\ncentury and millennium with regard to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe in Uganda recognize that the United Nations\r\nplayed a pivotal role in the decolonization of Africa and\r\nother parts of the world. The United Nations played an\r\nequally vital role in the eradication of institutionalized\r\nracial discrimination in southern Africa. For all these\r\nefforts we are grateful.\r\nThe question arises as to what should be the vision\r\nand goals of the United Nations through the next century.\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nIt is the view and expectation of the people of Uganda that\r\nthe focus of the United Nations should be the elimination\r\nof poverty in Africa and the rest of the underdeveloped\r\nworld. The factors underlying underdevelopment have been\r\nmentioned several times. However, implementation of\r\nsolutions has fallen short of expectations.\r\nWe urge the United Nations to adopt concrete\r\nmeasures to deal with problems of the external debt burden,\r\nilliteracy, disease and famine. We expect the United\r\nNations, through the World Trade Organization, to create a\r\nmore favourable international trading regime which can\r\npromote fair competition and permit the ascendancy of\r\nprimary commodity producers from abject poverty to\r\nreasonable wealth.\r\nUganda supports the heroic struggle of the Sahraoui\r\npeople for self-determination, and we look forward to the\r\nholding of a referendum by the United Nations to enable\r\nthe people of that territory to freely determine their destiny.\r\nMy delegation would like to express deep appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and former United\r\nStates Secretary of State, Mr. James Baker, for their tireless\r\nefforts in this regard. We appeal to the Government of the\r\nKingdom of Morocco to respect the verdict of the Sahraoui\r\npeople and to facilitate the implementation of whatever\r\ndecision they make.\r\nThe situation in the Great Lakes region, and\r\nparticularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has\r\nbeen cause for serious concern, not only to the countries in\r\nthe region, but also to the international community. On its\r\npart, Uganda continues to view issues of peace and stability\r\nin the region with the utmost seriousness, which they\r\ndeserve.\r\nUganda\u0027s desire for peace and stability is born out of\r\nits conviction that without regional peace and security there\r\ncan be no meaningful economic development and social\r\nwell-being of its people. Uganda is hopeful that the\r\nconflicts that today beset many countries in the region will\r\ngive way to peace and eventual socio-economic\r\ntransformation. We are also hopeful that, with the region\u0027s\r\nresolve, we shall be able to surmount the challenges and\r\nexploit the opportunities of the new millennium. Indeed,\r\nsustained efforts are being made to put an end to the crisis\r\nand contribute to the search for peaceful solutions to the\r\nproblems facing the region. And whereas efforts and\r\ncontributions towards peace in the region have traversed a\r\nlong and difficult road, there is optimism for the future.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\r\ncountries in the region, with the support of the\r\ninternational community, have been working tirelessly\r\ntowards promoting a peaceful solution to the crisis. We\r\nacknowledge the regional efforts, under the leadership of\r\nPresident Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, which culminated\r\nin the signing of the ceasefire Agreement. I pay tribute to\r\nall the parties concerned for this achievement and to all\r\nwell-wishers for their continued support for the peace\r\nprocess. The Agreement was thoroughly negotiated to the\r\nsatisfaction of all the parties.\r\nUganda appeals to the international community to\r\nassist in efforts to operationalize the Joint Military\r\nCommission and the Political Committee, which are\r\norgans of the Lusaka Agreement and the key to the\r\nsuccess of this Agreement and, therefore, to peace in the\r\nsubregion.\r\nUganda is committed to the implementation of the\r\nLusaka Agreement and believes that all the signatories to\r\nthe Agreement are committed to its success. Against this\r\nbackground, it was unnecessary for this matter to be\r\nincluded on the agenda of the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The Ceasefire Agreement essentially\r\ncovers the two primary causes of the conflict in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, namely, the external\r\nand internal dimensions. Regarding the external\r\ndimension, a mechanism was established to handle the\r\nsecurity concerns of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and its neighbouring countries, including Uganda.\r\nIn particular, the Security Council was requested, in\r\ncollaboration with the Organization of African Unity, to\r\nconstitute, facilitate and deploy an appropriate\r\npeacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo to ensure implementation of the Agreement,\r\nincluding the tracking down, disarming and documenting\r\nof all renegade forces in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nRegarding the internal dimension, the Congolese\r\nparties agreed to undertake political negotiations as a\r\nresult of which the parties are expected to conclude an\r\nagreement leading to a new political dispensation in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, to the restructuring\r\nand rebuilding of a new national army in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and to the establishment and\r\nstrengthening of State administration over the entire\r\nterritory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is\r\nUganda\u0027s hope that the inter-Congolese negotiations will\r\nprovide an opportunity for the Congolese parties to\r\naddress issues of good governance. Our desire for the\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nCongolese people to reach mutual understanding derives\r\nfrom the fact that political instability in any neighbouring\r\ncountry directly impinges on our own security and\r\neconomic development. We will look forward, therefore, to\r\nthe early beginning and success of the inter-Congolese\r\nnegotiations.\r\nRegarding the conflict in the Sudan, Uganda supports\r\nthe ongoing peace initiative launched under the auspices of\r\nthe Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\r\nand with the facilitation of President Daniel arap Moi of\r\nKenya. As a neighbour and a member of IGAD, Uganda\r\nhas been working closely with the other countries in the\r\nregion in efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict. However, peace in that country remains elusive.\r\nUganda is convinced that the fundamental issue in the\r\nSudanese crisis is the link between state and religion. In a\r\nmultireligious and multicultural society such as the Sudan,\r\nthe only way to achieve good governance is to guarantee\r\nfreedom of worship, equality and respect for all.\r\nAt the bilateral level, we are concerned at the\r\nincreasing hostility towards Uganda from the Sudan, as\r\nmanifested in the consistent violation of Uganda\u0027s territorial\r\nintegrity and in active support for rebel groups that are\r\ndestabilizing us. Uganda has embraced and will continue to\r\nembrace all initiatives aimed at reconciliation with the\r\nSudan, despite the fact that all previous initiatives have\r\nfailed. I would like to single out initiatives by former\r\nPresident Rafsanjani of Iran, President Bakili Muluzi of\r\nMalawi, President Qadhafi of Libya, former President\r\nMandela of South Africa and others — all these efforts\r\nhave come to naught.\r\nThe three East African countries of Kenya, Tanzania\r\nand Uganda are very conscious of the fact that political\r\nstability is a prerequisite for economic development and\r\nhave taken the necessary measures to achieve this objective.\r\nThe three countries, together with their partners in the\r\nregion, are engaged in regional peace efforts for Burundi,\r\nthe Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nthrough organizations such as IGAD and the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community. The three countries have\r\ninvested in peace in order to ensure regional stability\r\nbecause of the recognition that peace and political stability\r\nare vital if the region is to attract investments.\r\nToday, our region has created a favourable\r\nenvironment for foreign investment. There exists a very\r\nstrong political will to move the region towards closer\r\ncooperation. We have harmonized many of our economic\r\npolicies, and a number of joint activities in support of\r\nregional economic integration are being undertaken. The\r\nthree countries are now in an advanced stage of\r\ncementing the relationship by signing a treaty that would\r\nestablish the East African Community before the end of\r\nthe year. We thank our development partners who have\r\nbeen supporting our efforts towards regional economic\r\nintegration and look forward to continued cooperation,\r\nespecially in the area of infrastructure development and in\r\nthe field of capacity-building for the private sector, which\r\nhave been identified as the key areas.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to state that Uganda\r\nshares the vision of an African renaissance in which\r\nAfrican peoples participate fully in their systems of\r\ngovernance and in the process of determining their\r\ndestiny. We believe that this is a recipe for rapid\r\neconomic development and therefore for the eradication\r\nof poverty in Africa.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have\r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this\r\nmeeting.\r\nI call on the representative of the Sudan, who wishes\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to 5 minutes for the second intervention\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Khalil (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We would\r\nnot be taking your time at this late hour, Mr. President,\r\nnor that of the Assembly if the representative of the\r\nUgandan regime had not made certain accusations\r\nregarding my country. I would like to reply to his\r\nfabrications. But first, I would like to recall a passage\r\nfrom a statement made by a Foreign Minister yesterday.\r\nHe reminded us of the wise Buddhist understanding that\r\npeople should ascertain facts before levelling accusations\r\nagainst others. We all know that all monotheistic religions\r\nand common moral values impose such standards on all\r\nof us.\r\nWe would like to reaffirm the respect and\r\nappreciation of the Sudanese people for the brotherly\r\nUgandan people, with whom we share blood, historical\r\nties and a common destiny. At the same time, we would\r\nlike to remind the international community of the\r\npractices of the Ugandan regime and the character of its\r\nPresident. In this Assembly and in the Security Council\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 15th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 25 September 1999\r\nthere have been many discussions and examples regarding\r\nthe policies of the Ugandan regime and its interventions. A\r\nrepresentative of a certain State described the Ugandan\r\nPresident less than a year ago as a new Hitler. This was\r\nbecause of the many interventions and conflicts and the\r\ninstability that the Ugandan regime has fostered and\r\npractised in all its neighbouring countries.\r\nThese acts were committed to achieve personal aims\r\nthat are not recognized by international laws nor by African\r\ntraditions and norms. We are all aware of these attempts,\r\nparticularly the most recent, to invade a neighbouring State.\r\nSuffice it to say that one item on our agenda is entitled\r\n“Armed aggression against the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo”.\r\nThese practices and policies of the Ugandan President,\r\ncommitted before the eyes of the entire international\r\ncommunity, inter alia, to pillage the wealth of certain\r\ncountries in which his forces had intervened and to transfer\r\nsuch wealth to his personal accounts have been reported in\r\nthe world\u0027s press along with sarcastic reference to the\r\nextensive national resources that he wasted in carrying out\r\nsuch adventures. The Sudan, like all Uganda\u0027s neighbours,\r\nhas also suffered from the adventures and the intervention\r\nof the Ugandan President in its internal affairs. These\r\nactions have all been documented by the Security Council\r\nand I do not believe I need to recall them all at this point.\r\nAt a time when the Ugandan representative claims\r\nbefore the General Assembly that his country supports the\r\nefforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development\r\nto establish peace in southern Sudan, Uganda is actually\r\nproviding political and material support to the southern\r\nrebels, who are headquartered on Ugandan territory, whence\r\nthey launch their operations. The Ugandan representative\r\nalso claimed that it was the Sudan that rejected all attempts\r\nby Iran, Libya and Mali to mediate the conflict between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\nAll interested parties, especially those States that\r\nsincerely and repeatedly tried to reconcile our differences,\r\nare well aware of the reasons behind the failure of these\r\nattempts. The Ugandan President has continually made\r\npromises and signed joint statements and agreements on\r\nwhich he then reneged, reconfirming again and again the\r\nnon-credibility of the Ugandan regime and that it has\r\ndesigns in the region to foment instability not only in the\r\nSudan, but also in other neighbouring States.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention of\r\nthe General Assembly to document A/INF/54/3, which\r\ncontains a tentative programme of work and schedule of\r\nplenary meetings for the period from 29 September to the\r\nend of November and which has been distributed in the\r\nHall.\r\nThis schedule was prepared to facilitate the\r\norganization of work of delegations and to help ensure\r\nthat the relevant documentation is ready for the discussion\r\nof the respective items.\r\nI should like to remind members that the list of\r\nspeakers for the follow-up to the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons under agenda item 106, “Social\r\ndevelopment, including questions relating to the world\r\nsocial situation and to youth, ageing, disabled persons and\r\nthe family”, is already open. The lists of speakers for\r\nother items listed in document A/INF/54/3 are open.\r\nIn addition I should like to announce the following\r\nactivities.\r\nThe 1999 United Nations Pledging Conference for\r\nDevelopment Activities will be held in the mornings of\r\nboth Tuesday and Wednesday, 2 and 3 November.\r\nThe announcement of voluntary contributions to the\r\n2000 programme of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees will take place on Thursday,\r\n18 November, in the morning.\r\nThe announcement of voluntary contributions to the\r\n2000 programmes of the United Nations Relief and\r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\r\nwill take place on Wednesday, 8 December, in the\r\nmorning.\r\nMembers are requested to consult the Journal for the\r\nannouncements on these activities for further details.\r\nI will in due course announce the dates for the\r\nconsideration of other agenda items as well as keep the\r\nAssembly informed of any additions or changes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.\r\n37\r\n"
