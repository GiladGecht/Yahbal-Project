(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on the Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign\r\nTrade of Jamaica, His Excellency The Honourable Seymour\r\nMullings.\r\nMr. Mullings (Jamaica): On behalf of the delegation\r\nof Jamaica I extend to you, Sir, our congratulations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fourth session. You and your country, Namibia, are\r\ngraduates of the United Nations, steeped in its principles,\r\nfaithful to its causes and committed to its goals. We have\r\nfull confidence that your leadership will continue to guide\r\nus this session in the adoption of constructive decisions\r\nwhich will serve to strengthen the role of the Organization\r\nin world affairs.\r\nWe express our appreciation to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nUruguay, for his outstanding work in conducting the\r\nbusiness of our last session. We congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/54/1) outlining the\r\nactivities of the Organization over the past year and\r\ncontaining his vision for its future work.\r\nJamaica welcomes the three States that this year have\r\njoined the membership of the United Nations: the Republic\r\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga. Their presence will enrich our deliberations as\r\nthey bring their particular experiences and perspectives to\r\ninfluence the direction and work of the Organization.\r\nTheir admission coincides with the holding of the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on small island\r\ndeveloping States which over the last two days addressed\r\nthe particular vulnerabilities of these States, which merit\r\nspecial attention within the international community.\r\nThe three nations we welcome today are also linked\r\nto Jamaica through the Commonwealth of Nations. This\r\nyear the Commonwealth celebrates its fiftieth anniversary,\r\nand we salute its achievements in cooperation —\r\nespecially in promoting the development objectives of its\r\nmembership — including the recent initiatives to address\r\nthe special problems of smaller States.\r\nThe widening of the gap between rich and poor and\r\nthe increasing marginalization of a large number of\r\ndeveloping countries within the world economic\r\nframework are urgent matters demanding the attention of\r\nthe international community. The reasons for these trends\r\nare well-known: superior endowments of natural\r\nresources; early advantages in modernizing production\r\nprocesses; high levels of capital accumulation and\r\ntechnological development — all have helped consolidate\r\nthe dominance of the developed countries in world\r\nproduction and trade. Countries which started later in the\r\nday will not find it easy to close the gap.\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nAnd it is not true that the developing countries have\r\nonly themselves to blame. Most of us have implemented\r\nprogrammes of structural adjustment and stabilization\r\npolicies, but we have found that the current orthodoxy of\r\nfree markets and a development model based on\r\nliberalization, deregulation and privatization is not providing\r\nthe promised benefits in trade and investment flows. There\r\nis evident need to review the prescriptions and to promote\r\na development policy which takes into greater account the\r\nspecific socio-economic context of developing countries and\r\nto devise more equitable arrangements in international\r\neconomic relations.\r\nIn an interdependent world, the human dimension of\r\nthe development equation, especially the growing incidence\r\nof poverty and all its manifestations, must continue to be a\r\nmatter of concern to the entire global community. It is\r\ntherefore essential that we seek to establish a better\r\nframework for development cooperation and to implement\r\nan agenda for development as a matter of priority within\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nCurrently, what we are seeing is a withering of interest\r\nand diminished commitment on the issue of cooperation for\r\ndevelopment and a hardening of attitudes in an atmosphere\r\nwhich preaches competitiveness and the survival of the\r\nfittest. It is clear to us that special arrangements are needed,\r\nnot only in relation to special categories of countries, but\r\nalso in relation to commodities, where serious problems\r\nwould result from the rigorous application of the dogma of\r\nfree trade. Regrettably, even where such special\r\narrangements exist they are under threat.\r\nThe challenge to the banana regime established within\r\nthe framework of the Lomé Convention and the ruling of\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) panel, which has\r\nnow led to negotiations for an amended regime, sends a\r\nmessage which is particularly discouraging and signals the\r\nindifference of some countries to the plight of others. The\r\nend result is not yet determined, but at this time the\r\neconomies of some Caribbean States face a danger not just\r\nto their prospects for economic stability and growth, but to\r\ntheir very survival. Many appeals have been made which\r\nhave gone unheeded. More than anything else, the banana\r\ncontroversy has signified the extent to which the interests\r\nof small producers are at the mercy of those in a position\r\nof dominance in the world economy and world trade.\r\nAnother discouraging trend is the diminished\r\nsignificance and reduced contributions of donor countries in\r\nthe area of development cooperation. At a time of the\r\nincreasing incidence of poverty and a looming threat of\r\nmarginalization, levels of official development assistance\r\nhave been steadily decreasing at both the bilateral and the\r\nmultilateral levels. In the case of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), technical assistance\r\nhas been shrinking, especially over the last five years. In\r\n1994, contributions to UNDP were in the region of $1.1\r\nbillion. This has steadily declined to the current level for\r\nthis year of $718 million.\r\nWe have been supporting initiatives for reform in\r\norder to promote better coordination and greater\r\nefficiency and cost-effectiveness in the delivery of\r\ntechnical assistance in the operational activities of the\r\nUnited Nations. What we have seen, however, is that the\r\nreform process seems more directed at generating cost\r\nsavings and achieving a pooling of resources without\r\nincreasing the quantum of funding available for\r\ndevelopment cooperation under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. The process under way is one of contraction of\r\nUnited Nations-related development activities at the\r\ncountry level and a withering-away of the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in an area of critical importance for\r\ndeveloping countries. The reduced impact of the United\r\nNations at the country level is already significant and\r\ncomes at a time when the needs are greater than ever.\r\nWe call for a new commitment to development\r\ncooperation, a new global partnership between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing countries and a new\r\ndialogue to review the policies and principles directing\r\ninternational economic relations, and for a new\r\ndispensation with regard to policy prescriptions affecting\r\nthe development process. Without this, developing\r\ncountries will be engulfed in the perils of globalization\r\nwith consequences not just for economic welfare, but for\r\nthe viability of political structures and social stability.\r\nThere are also other, more insidious dimensions of\r\nglobalization, especially those which impinge on the\r\nsecurity of States, which we must consider. Within the\r\ngrowing internationalization of markets facilitated by\r\nimproved technology and policies of liberalization, the\r\nspectre of transnational crime has grown to significant\r\nproportions, especially in the illicit trade in narcotics and\r\nsmall arms. Together, these instruments of death and\r\ndestruction represent a significant danger to the internal\r\nsecurity of many countries, fostering criminal activities\r\nwhich serve to destabilize and corrupt the social order, to\r\nundermine democratic institutions and to increase\r\nlawlessness.\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nWe believe that this growing trade in weapons, which\r\npromotes organized crime, terrorist activities and drug\r\ntrafficking, requires the urgent attention of the international\r\ncommunity. Jamaica therefore welcomes the arrangements\r\nfor the holding of the first international conference on small\r\narms, which is to take place in the year 2000. We look\r\nforward to this as a good opportunity to develop a\r\nprogramme for implementation by Member States to control\r\nthe scale and distribution of these weapons.\r\nOn reviewing the broader issue of international\r\nsecurity, we have to note developments which give rise to\r\nconcern and anxiety about the future of the world order and\r\nthe role of the United Nations. The Organization should\r\nbecome engaged wherever international peace is threatened\r\nand where conflicts break out. Although the danger of\r\nglobal conflict arising from ideological confrontation has\r\nnow, in large measure, receded, the world is still full of\r\nthreats to peace.\r\nWars continue to be waged at the regional level,\r\nprimarily as a result of regional rivalries and unresolved\r\nterritorial disputes. At the national level, ethnic strife and\r\npolitical divisiveness have continued to fuel internal\r\nconflict, leading to heavy loss of life and economic\r\ndisruption and affecting regional stability from the\r\nspill-over of refugees to neighbouring States.\r\nWe endorse the Secretary-General\u0027s strategy of quiet\r\ndiplomacy and urge him to use his influence wherever\r\npossible to forestall the outbreak of conflict and to promote\r\npeace and reconciliation between disputing parties. In\r\naccordance with the principles of national sovereignty, he\r\nwill need the cooperation and support of Member States in\r\nhis efforts for the maintenance of peace, as delicate\r\nproblems can arise in relation to any process of diplomatic\r\nintervention with respect to the role to be undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations and appropriate regional organizations.\r\nDuring the past year, events in the Balkans have raised\r\nprofound questions about the principle of intervention, the\r\nuse of force, the scale of military enforcement and the role\r\nof the Security Council. The debate on these questions has\r\nrevealed differing perspectives, elements of consensus and\r\nvarying positions on the applicable principles of\r\ninternational law. In recent times, we have witnessed\r\natrocities committed as a result of the practice of ethnic\r\ncleansing as communities rise up against each other to\r\nsettle old grievances. We all must continue to condemn\r\nthese practices and understand the need for some kind of\r\naction to halt such excesses which violate international\r\nhumanitarian norms.\r\nHowever, the principles of international law affecting\r\nthe sovereignty of States and the use of force should not\r\nbe brushed aside. We believe in the adoption of an\r\napproach which has the confidence of the international\r\ncommunity whereby diplomatic and any necessary\r\nenforcement action is taken or authorized by the\r\nmultilateral institutions entrusted with safeguarding\r\ninternational peace and security. The Security Council has\r\nthe primary responsibility. It should not be ignored and\r\ndisregarded in favour of unilateral action on the part of\r\nany State or group of States.\r\nWhile the situation in the Balkans has dominated\r\ninternational attention over the past year, more attention\r\nshould be given to the situation in Africa, where even\r\nmore serious problems have arisen involving ethnic strife\r\nand political turmoil, affecting neighbouring States and\r\ncreating humanitarian emergencies. As the\r\nSecretary-General has observed in his report, too little\r\nattention has been given to the conflicts arising in Africa\r\ndespite the enormous toll in loss of life and in disruption\r\nand suffering resulting from armed insurgencies and\r\ninter-State conflict. However, we are encouraged by the\r\nprocess taking place in the West African region affecting\r\nLiberia and Sierra Leone. We must pay tribute to the\r\nwork of the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), which has shouldered the burden of peace-\r\nbuilding in these two States so battered by civil conflict.\r\nWe also note with appreciation the efforts of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) in regard to the\r\nsituation in the Great Lakes region and hope that the\r\nLusaka Agreement will form the basis for reconciliation\r\nand peace. The situation in Angola remains a tragic one\r\nfor the country, and the international community should\r\nremain united in support of measures taken against the\r\nUNITA insurgency and to bring an end to the nightmare\r\nwhich has for so long impeded the progress of that\r\ncountry.\r\nWe are distressed by the continuing problems in the\r\nHorn of Africa. We continue to support regional efforts\r\ntowards peacemaking between Ethiopia and Eritrea and\r\nwelcome the OAU framework agreement which has been\r\nworked out to assist the parties to reach a settlement. We\r\nurge the Secretary-General to continue to maintain close\r\ncontact with the parties in all the areas of tension, with\r\nthe aim of promoting peace and stability, and to foster a\r\nspirit of reconciliation so that African States may be able\r\nto concentrate their efforts in confronting the critical\r\nchallenges of economic and social development.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nIn the Middle East, while the situation still remains\r\ntroublesome, there are some signs of renewed hope with the\r\nrevival of the peace process and the emergence of a more\r\npositive climate for making progress towards a settlement.\r\nWe welcome the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh\r\nMemorandum earlier this month and urge the parties to\r\nmove towards accommodation, to seek to realize the\r\nlegitimate rights of all parties as the basis for a just and\r\ndurable peace. The challenge is formidable and the solution\r\nwill require statesmanship and courage.\r\nIn South-East Asia the outbreak of violence in East\r\nTimor is a matter which has caused deep concern. As there\r\nis an obvious need for ensuring the safety of the inhabitants\r\nof the territory, we fully support the deployment of the\r\ninternational force which is now in the territory to maintain\r\norder. It is necessary now to contemplate the next step,\r\nwhich will be to devise arrangements for the political future\r\nof the territory.\r\nIn our area of Latin America and the Caribbean there\r\nremain a number of unresolved territorial disputes but our\r\nexpectation is that States in our region will use available\r\nmechanisms to resolve such disputes by peaceful means. In\r\nthe Caribbean our efforts are directed towards developing\r\ngreater integration both within the Caribbean Community\r\nand within the wider ambit of the Association of Caribbean\r\nStates, ACS. This is part of our regional effort towards\r\nestablishing a regime of peace and cooperation in the\r\nCaribbean Sea. In this regard, I should express our ongoing\r\nconcern over the remaining remnants of cold war politics in\r\nour region. The continuation of the embargo against Cuba\r\nis a source of tension and carries the risk of conflict, which\r\nis particularly troubling for neighbouring States. In the\r\nspirit of the friendly relations we enjoy with Cuba and the\r\nUnited States, we call for dialogue, the normalization of\r\nrelations and an end to policies of confrontation and\r\nexclusion.\r\nSmall countries have an important interest in ensuring\r\nthat peace and stability is a permanent feature of the world\r\norder. In the absence of military power we depend on\r\ndiplomacy and on the United Nations and its machinery and\r\ninternational adherence to its principles to safeguard and\r\nprotect those who are militarily weak. It is in our interest\r\nto seek to strengthen and uphold all the multilateral\r\ninstitutions dedicated to this effort. The Security Council,\r\nwhich has such an important role in this structure, should\r\nbe given the fullest support in meeting its responsibilities.\r\nThis is best achieved through the democratic participation\r\nof the United Nations membership in the work of the\r\nCouncil, which serves to strengthen its effectiveness and to\r\ngive it greater credibility within the international system.\r\nJamaica supports that process and aspires for\r\nmembership of the Council for a two-year period\r\nbeginning next year. We do so out of a motivation to\r\nmake our contribution as a small State in the management\r\nof international peace and security. We are driven by a\r\nstrong commitment to multilateralism and to upholding\r\nthe principles of the Charter and by a determination to\r\nexercise a careful and balanced judgement in relation to\r\nall issues affecting peace and security which may come\r\nbefore us. It will be our goal to assist the Security\r\nCouncil to work effectively and to act decisively. We will\r\nseek to involve the broader membership in its\r\nconsultations and to influence the discharge of the\r\nCouncil\u0027s responsibilities with fairness and with full\r\nrespect for the legitimate interests of all parties, within\r\nthe broader interest of international peace and security.\r\nThe work of the United Nations in the area of\r\nhumanitarian relief has always been an important part of\r\nits operations, and this is the area in which its work has\r\nhad the most direct impact and practical meaning at the\r\nlevel of the people. This is particularly so in the delivery\r\nof emergency relief in natural disasters. The increase in\r\nthe scale and intensity of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods\r\nand famine in recent times has increased the demands on\r\nthe system, and there is an obvious need to maintain\r\ncapability and readiness in the relevant agencies. At the\r\nsame time, we should support the various initiatives for\r\ndisaster prevention, including the enforcement of stricter\r\nbuilding codes, improved drainage systems, the exchange\r\nof scientific knowledge, increased monitoring and the use\r\nof early-warning systems to protect ourselves and mitigate\r\nthe damage.\r\nMuch more can be done to avert disasters in those\r\nareas where members have greater control and power.\r\nMan-made disasters create a tragic problem of refugees,\r\nwhich otherwise is often the result of war, persecution or\r\npolitical turmoil. The tragic plight of refugees uprooted\r\nfrom their homes and forced to flee is a sad and\r\ndisturbing picture, and even more so for the neighbouring\r\nStates, which are often poor countries that do not have\r\nthe means to handle heavy inflows.\r\nAs we have seen from the Secretary-General\u0027s report,\r\none of the distressing practices in recent conflicts has\r\nbeen the deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarian\r\nworkers. This unacceptable flouting of humanitarian\r\nnorms is a matter of serious concern for us and indicates\r\nthe need for further elaboration of principles of\r\ninternational humanitarian law applicable in time of war.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nOur review of the state of the world in the economic,\r\npolitical and humanitarian dimensions suggests the need for\r\ngreater effort in building political commitment and\r\ninvesting resources for achieving common goals. Too many\r\nof the old problems remain unresolved, and our unity of\r\npurpose is too often compromised by political differences\r\nand considerations of narrow economic interests. At a time\r\nof increasing globalization, the reality of interdependence\r\nshould be leading us in the other direction — towards\r\nmutual respect, tolerance, understanding and partnership in\r\na world of diversity, for these are the true foundations of\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nAs we close this century and approach the new\r\nmillennium, we should do so in the hope of reaching\r\ngreater achievements by acting in concert to uphold our\r\nideals of humanity and to fight the common enemies of\r\nmankind: war, poverty, human suffering and injustice. This\r\nshould be our firm resolve.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Poland, His Excellency Mr. Bronislav Geremek.\r\nMr. Geremek (Poland): Please accept my\r\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its current session. We are indeed\r\nglad to have a distinguished statesman from Africa\r\npresiding over important deliberations on global security\r\nand development. I am sure that your personal attributes, as\r\nwell as your diplomatic skills, will ensure the success that\r\nis expected from the Assembly. The delegation of Poland\r\nwill do its best to assist you in your important functions.\r\nMy compliments go also to the President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-third session, Mr. Didier Opertti of\r\nUruguay, for the outstanding commitment he demonstrated\r\nduring his presidency.\r\nIt is with satisfaction that we welcome in our midst\r\nthe new Members of the United Nations: the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nIt was with the utmost attention that we listened to the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s introduction of his report on the work\r\nof the Organization. His interesting and highly stimulating\r\nideas will guide us throughout the whole fifty-fourth session\r\nof the General Assembly. May I assure the\r\nSecretary-General of our deep respect and support for all\r\nhis endeavours.\r\nIn my statement today, I wish to focus on the three\r\nissues which, in my view, are at the centre of discussions\r\nwithin this Organization. These are, first, human\r\nfreedoms, and in particular the question of rethinking the\r\nprinciple of national sovereignty and non-interference;\r\nsecondly, current challenges to the United Nations\r\nCharter-based system of international security; and\r\nthirdly, coping with contradictions of globalization\r\nthrough better international cooperation.\r\nWe have recently been witnessing new, painful\r\nmanifestations of ethnic hatred in Kosovo. Armed clashes\r\nhave again shaken the north Caucasus. East Timor is\r\nanother example of intolerance and the folly of violence.\r\nWe pay homage to the victims of this violence. But the\r\npeople in all the crisis-stricken areas expect more from us\r\nthan just words of sympathy.\r\nWe should pose ourselves some questions: could\r\nthese new outbursts of conflict have been prevented? Is\r\nthere a political will to head them off in the future? If the\r\nanswer is positive, then what should be done to translate\r\nour political commitment into action in a concerted and\r\neffective way? How should the system of international\r\nrelations be improved to give people the hope that they\r\nwill not be left defenceless in the face of genocide and\r\npersecution?\r\nThe United Nations Charter-based system of\r\ninternational security was born of the lessons of a\r\ndevastating world war which started with blatant\r\nviolations of sovereignty of States. To address this reality,\r\nthe system of international law and institutions was\r\nrightly geared to give those nations a sense of security\r\nand to prevent inter-State conflict. Most of today\u0027s\r\nconflicts, however, are of an intra-State nature. They stem\r\nfrom human rights abuses, social tensions or the collapse\r\nof State structures. Can we tackle the new challenges with\r\nexisting concepts and notions only?\r\nWe have come to understand that absolute\r\nsovereignty and total non-interference are no longer\r\ntenable. There is not, and there cannot be, a sovereign\r\nright to ethnic cleansing and genocide. We have learned\r\nthat what should not be repeated is the unacceptable\r\ninaction which occurred in the past, such as in the\r\nRwandan crisis. Rwanda demonstrates what Kosovo might\r\nhave become had we not intervened in 1999. Kosovo\r\ndemonstrates what Rwanda might have been had we\r\nintervened in 1994. The burden of responsibility is\r\nenormous, the lesson clear.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nAt the same time, we should follow the principle that\r\nour responsibility is the same for all ethnic groups. In\r\nKosovo the ethnic cleansing of Albanians by Serbs has\r\nbeen stopped and reversed, but now we witness that the\r\npresence of Serbs and Roma in Kosovo is under threat.\r\nIn this decade the international community has through\r\nits actions — recently in Kosovo and in East Timor —\r\nrecognized the universal political and moral imperative to\r\nact in order to stop gross and systematic violations of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThis recognition, setting aside the distinction between\r\ninter- and intra-State conflicts, reflects the spirit of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nIndeed, the central figure of the system of the United\r\nNations must be the human being — his or her right to a\r\npeaceful life, to personal freedom, to a decent existence and\r\ndignity. When human life and freedoms are assailed and\r\nindividual rights brutally violated, then we must not remain\r\nindifferent and unconcerned: we cannot stand idle.\r\nThe imperative to act raises the question of the right\r\nto act. We have recognized that the walls of sovereignty\r\ncannot be used to conceal and legitimize the abuse of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Sovereignty\r\ncannot mean impunity for genocide and human rights\r\nabuses.\r\nLet us all remember that it remains one of the\r\nfundamental objectives of the United Nations\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the\r\ndignity and worth of the human person, in the equal\r\nrights of men and women and of nations large and\r\nsmall”.\r\nThe primacy of the human person and human rights,\r\nhowever, has to be adequately reflected in the application\r\nof international law. This is not an easy task, first, because\r\nthere are still too many cases where behind hypocritical\r\nlip-service to human rights there exist practices of curbing\r\nand limiting those rights for the sake of preserving political\r\npower; secondly, because the legal framework of\r\nintervention, which should ensure the possibility of quick\r\nand effective action, is too often distorted by selective and\r\nsubjective interpretations.\r\nOn the one hand, the banner of humanitarian\r\nintervention should not be used as a pretext for imposing\r\npolitical control and domination from the outside. We want\r\nto make the walls of sovereignty surmountable, but not\r\nfor all purposes. On the other hand, the principle of\r\nhumanitarian intervention has to be fairly and consistently\r\napplied to avoid double standards.\r\nThe development of international law should thus\r\nuphold the basic truth that a sustainable, lasting and\r\nsecure order in international relations can be built only on\r\nthe freedom of the human being.\r\nThe principle of solidarity in international relations\r\nshould grow in importance, since it also provides the key\r\nto the effectiveness of the mission of the United Nations.\r\nActing for universal observance of human rights\r\nwhile preserving the necessary content of the notion of\r\nsovereignty raises the question of the best strategies for\r\nhumanitarian intervention. We have but to agree that\r\nintervention by force is an instrument of last resort. What\r\nis preferable is an early and cooperative engagement to\r\ncorrect the practices that give rise to concern. There is no\r\ndoubt that armed intervention is a sign of the failure of\r\ncooperative methods.\r\nWe support wholeheartedly the efforts to foster a\r\nnew culture of prevention. The basis for this philosophy\r\nshould be the universal recognition that international\r\ncommitments undertaken by States in the field of human\r\nrights are matters of direct and legitimate concern to other\r\nStates as well, before their abuse degenerates into a threat\r\nto international peace and security. Human rights do not\r\nbelong exclusively to the internal affairs of States.\r\nThe present session of the General Assembly will\r\nlead us into the year 2000. Let this symbolic date inspire\r\nus to reflect upon the mission of the United Nations, to\r\nmake the millennium summit a truly meaningful event.\r\nOn the eve of the next millennium, the world still needs\r\nthe United Nations, while the United Nations needs a new\r\nvision. Faced with new and more demanding challenges,\r\nwe are of the opinion that the solutions to them require\r\njoint and concerted actions by the whole community of\r\nStates. The United Nations needs a reinforced\r\ncommitment by its Member States to the purposes and\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter.\r\nLet us try to find new strength for the Organization\r\nby reaching back to the intellectual and normative origins\r\nof the United Nations. Contrary to some assertions, we\r\nbelieve that the Charter is not outdated in its basic\r\nmessage. What it needs is a new, fresh and visionary\r\nreading in the context of new international realities and\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nchallenges. For example, with respect to Chapter VIII of\r\nthe Charter, we note that many of today\u0027s conflicts are local\r\nin nature. It is for this reason that the relationship between\r\nthe United Nations and regional security needs to be further\r\nexplored.\r\nThose actors who are closer to events and have a\r\nlarger stake in regional stability might be the ones who\r\nwould be willing to react more promptly and with greater\r\ndetermination. This is why Poland supports increased\r\nresponsibility of regional organizations for conflict\r\nprevention and crisis management. In regions where such\r\norganizations exist and have the necessary potential, they\r\nshould be involved more actively in solving substantial\r\nproblems. One possible example of how to use them\r\nconstructively is the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe.\r\nThus, the key to effective use of the principle of\r\nsubsidiarity is closer political and operational cooperation\r\nbetween the Security Council and regional organizations.\r\nA debate on United Nations reform has been going on\r\nfor a number of years. The fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nOrganization stimulated the discussion, which resulted in a\r\nuniversal understanding of the need for changes. Many of\r\nthose changes have already been implemented, thanks to the\r\ntireless efforts of the Secretary-General. This process\r\nshould, however, be deepened and accelerated. The Security\r\nCouncil offers a case in point.\r\nThe Security Council, upon which primary\r\nresponsibility has been conferred for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, occasionally finds it\r\ndifficult to act in situations of inter-State or local armed\r\nconflicts, even when those situations have a dangerous\r\nspillover potential. Whether for reasons of broad ideological\r\nmotivations or narrow national interests, members can block\r\nvitally needed decisions, and adversely affect the security\r\nof certain regions. How are we to eliminate situations in\r\nwhich the Security Council is prevented from taking up its\r\nresponsibilities? How are we to increase the effectiveness\r\nof the Security Council, combining effectiveness with\r\nenhanced representativeness? Reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is long overdue: let us undertake a decisive effort\r\nto make it a reality. Let us think anew of how to strengthen\r\nthe authority of the Council and preclude the possibility that\r\nits decisions will be ignored or misimplemented by\r\nindividual States.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nA few weeks ago, two young Africans froze to death\r\non their flight between Conakry and Brussels. They had\r\nstowed away in the landing gear of the aircraft. They left\r\nbehind a moving appeal addressed to the people and\r\npoliticians in charge in Europe that has already been\r\nquoted in this Hall. In view of the special nature of that\r\nappeal, I should once again like to quote from it. They\r\nwrote:\r\n“Help us. ... We are suffering enormously in Africa.\r\n... We have war, disease and we lack food. ... We\r\nwish to be educated and we ask you to help us so\r\nthat we can study and be, in Africa, just the same as\r\nyou are”.\r\nThere is no more eloquent appeal to people\u0027s hearts and\r\nconsciences than those words of despair written by\r\nchildren.\r\nWe must find the right solutions to the social and\r\neconomic failures, to the threats and to the lack of\r\nprospects that people and societies face and consider the\r\nurgent need to change the present framework of\r\ninternational cooperation. Frustration and the lack of\r\nsocial action cause conflict and a lack of stability. We\r\nmust think about how to integrate our social and\r\neconomic programmes with the general imperative of the\r\nnew culture of prevention.\r\nPoland is prepared to participate in these efforts, the\r\naim of which is to build a world based on these\r\nprinciples. However, our resources are limited. Our\r\ncountry is only just emerging from a period of major\r\neconomic crisis caused by the communist system and its\r\ncentralized planning, with its waste and bad management.\r\nEven so, we are now creating a complex and effective\r\nsystem of cooperation for development that will\r\ndemonstrate our commitment in poverty eradication\r\nactivities. At the same time, we are prepared to share with\r\nother countries the development experience we ourselves\r\nhave acquired during the process of reform of our\r\npolitical and economic systems over the last 10 years of\r\ntransformation.\r\nGlobalization must become a process with a human\r\nface. Certain basic principles must be better integrated\r\ninto the development machinery: specifically, solidarity;\r\ncombating marginalization; responsibility; and equal\r\nopportunity. Combating marginalization: that of the least\r\ndeveloped countries, which do not yet enjoy the benefits\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nof globalization. Responsibility: that of Governments in\r\nimplementing policies of good governance, in respecting\r\nhuman rights and in being aware that the well-being of all\r\npeople everywhere is just as important as the well-being of\r\ntheir own nations. Equal opportunity: for the poorest, and\r\nthose who are still sidelined by society. And solidarity: in\r\nfacing our common challenges — terrorism, organized\r\ncrime, environmental threats, natural disasters, AIDS —\r\ntogether.\r\nUnfortunately, we still have much left to do before we\r\nattain these goals. The 1999 United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) Human Development Report provides\r\nfresh, shocking evidence of social breakdown and threats to\r\nhuman security. The challenges I have just mentioned are\r\njust part of a more universal question: how can we respond\r\nto the new realities of the world? Global policies have not\r\nbeen fully adapted to cover the increasing number of\r\ncomplicated and contradictory phenomena that cannot be\r\ntackled with traditional diplomatic instruments. The process\r\nof designing policies is still basically the job of individual\r\nnations, whereas the challenges we are facing require\r\ncreative cooperation at the global level. It is for this reason\r\nthat, Governments must further integrate the idea of\r\ninternational cooperation into their national policies, while\r\navoiding the temptation of authoritarianism. This, however,\r\nhighlights the urgent need to revise and strengthen our\r\ninstitutional arrangements regarding the design of global\r\npolicy, particularly with regard to the most complex\r\nproblems of trade, finance and the environment.\r\nInternational cooperation must be more open to other\r\nactors in civil society by reflecting the rich network of\r\nrelationships. While several countries are re-evaluating their\r\nnational policies, democratizing their societies, privatizing\r\ntheir national economies and decentralizing economic and\r\npolitical power, at the international level we are, broadly\r\nspeaking, still confining ourselves to conventional\r\nintergovernmental actions. The United Nations must\r\npromote active international cooperation whereby\r\ngovernments and the various sectors of civil society act\r\ntogether towards common goals.\r\nIn this connection, we welcome the “Partners for\r\nDevelopment” initiative of the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD). By breaking from normal practice, this will\r\nallow more active participation by the public and private\r\nsectors and by representatives of government and the\r\nbusiness and intellectual worlds in resolving various\r\ncomplex development problems.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAs someone who has witnessed the atrocities but\r\nalso the tremendous progress that the twentieth century\r\nhas brought us, I look towards the coming century with\r\nmuch optimism. This optimism is justified first and\r\nforemost by the liberation of nations and peoples, the\r\nwave of democratization, the market reforms all over the\r\nworld and the universal understanding of human rights\r\nideals. Fewer people live in constant fear of arbitrary\r\narrest, torture or worse. I also look towards the coming\r\ncentury with hope because I see the predominant will to\r\nconsolidate those recent achievements.\r\nAddress by Mr. Malam Bacai Sanha, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guinea-\r\nBissau.\r\nMr. Malam Bacai Sanha, President of the Republic\r\nof Guinea-Bissau, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Malam Bacai Sanha, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sanha (spoke in Portuguese; French text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): Guinea-Bissau is gratified,\r\nSir, at your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly. The unanimous\r\nelection of a distinguished African diplomat such as\r\nyourself to this post is evidence of the conviction of the\r\nMember States of the Organization that, under your clear-\r\nsighted leadership, our work is certain to be successful.\r\nYour election is also a concrete expression of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan\u0027s dedication to the cause of peace, as\r\nwell as a recognition of Namibia\u0027s significant contribution\r\nto international peace-building. We pay tribute also to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the great\r\nsensitivity and skill he displayed in fulfilling his duties\r\nduring the fifty-third session.\r\nWe would like also to express, on behalf of the\r\npeople of Guinea-Bissau and on my own behalf, our\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nhis efforts towards international peace and security.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nGuinea-Bissau also welcomes the new States Members\r\nof the United Nations — Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga —\r\nwith which we intend to maintain relations of friendship\r\nand cooperation.\r\nOn the eve of the new millennium, Africa is\r\nexperiencing an increase in armed conflict that threatens\r\nregional peace and stability. Regrettably, West Africa has\r\nnot been spared this scourge. From the Liberian crisis to\r\nthat of Sierra Leone, not to mention Guinea-Bissau, our\r\nregion has been racked by periods of fratricidal violence\r\nwhose causes are manifold.\r\nIn the case of our country, the root causes of the\r\npolitical and military crisis include a lack of effectiveness\r\nand a loss of authority on the part of the State; poor\r\nmanagement; human rights violations; non-compliance with\r\nthe principle of the separation of power between sovereign\r\nbodies; corruption and deteriorating living conditions; and\r\ntotal frustration and despair on the part of those who fought\r\nfor freedom and their homeland.\r\nThe events of 7 June 1998 were a direct result of\r\nthese problems. Unfortunately, as is the case in every\r\nconflict, the crisis also resulted in a tragic situation for the\r\npopulation that included the loss of life, a massive flow of\r\nrefugees to neighbouring countries and large numbers of\r\ndisplaced persons, not to mention the devastation of the\r\neconomic and social infrastructure of the country.\r\nHaving experienced the horrors of war, the people of\r\nGuinea-Bissau today more than ever strongly aspire to live\r\nin peace and security, with hope for the future and in the\r\nfull enjoyment of their fundamental rights. Guinea-Bissau\r\nalso wishes to consolidate its unity and to promote a culture\r\nof peace and national reconciliation that is based on a\r\npluralist democracy with sound governance and on the rule\r\nof law.\r\nWe are determined to promote and protect the dignity\r\nof human beings and to enable their harmonious\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, we are pleased to note that a\r\nconference was convened recently in Guinea-Bissau for the\r\nreconciliation and unity of the people of our country. That\r\nevent of rare scope raised the awareness of our fellow\r\ncitizens and mobilized them with respect to national peace\r\nand reconciliation, which is a prerequisite for domestic\r\nsecurity and socio-economic progress.\r\nThe conference also received direct support from,\r\namong others, Sweden, the Netherlands and the\r\nrepresentative of the United Nations Secretary-General. All\r\nof Guinea-Bissau\u0027s vital elements participated, including\r\npolitical parties, non-governmental organizations, the\r\nGovernment, the military junta and our nationals living\r\nabroad.\r\nWe take this opportunity to affirm that we will spare\r\nno effort in working to consolidate the emerging\r\ndemocracy in Guinea-Bissau, basing ourselves on the\r\nsocial and cultural values of our people and on the\r\nprinciples of good relations as set out in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and that of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, in order to bring about a lasting peace in\r\nour country.\r\nIn this context, we will be holding legislative and\r\npresidential elections on 28 November, preceded by a\r\ncensus and the registration of electoral candidates. We\r\nwould like to reaffirm before the Assembly our\r\ndetermination to hold the elections as scheduled, despite\r\nthe slow response time of some of our partners in\r\ndevelopment with respect to the commitments entered into\r\nat the round table held in Geneva on 4 and 5 May.\r\nWe would like also express our heartfelt thanks to\r\nSweden, Portugal and the Netherlands for fulfilling their\r\ncommitments in a timely manner.\r\nWe take this opportunity to launch an urgent appeal\r\nto the international community to support Guinea-Bissau\r\nin its efforts to return to constitutional order, which is a\r\nprerequisite for restoring normal relations of cooperation\r\nwith its development partners.\r\nIt is also important to underscore our very positive\r\nrelations with the peoples of the subregion, in particular\r\nwith Senegal, and our desire to renew our fraternal ties of\r\ncooperation with the Republic of Guinea in order to help\r\nconsolidate peace and stability in the subregion.\r\nDespite the progress we have made in the struggle\r\nfor human dignity and freedom, the vast majority of\r\nhumankind lives in degrading conditions that are\r\nunacceptable to the collective conscience. This situation\r\nis the result of selfish interests that go against the moral\r\nand political values of the United Nations. The example\r\nof East Timor is a case in point.\r\nWith regard to East Timor, we are deeply concerned\r\nby the fact that after the popular consultation, whose\r\noutcome was favourable to the Maubere people, we\r\nwitnessed very violent acts which were completely at\r\nodds with the agreement of 5 May between Indonesia,\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nPortugal and the United Nations. We express our fraternal\r\nsolidarity with the heroic people of East Timor in the face\r\nof the genocide carried out by Indonesian militias. We\r\ncondemn those acts and demand respect for the desire for\r\nself-determination expressed in the popular consultation of\r\n30 August last. We welcome the strong — albeit late —\r\nreaction of the international community aimed at restoring\r\npeace and security in that territory. We appeal for efforts to\r\nbe intensified and call for technical, material and financial\r\naid for the rebuilding of East Timor, which has been\r\nbrutally destroyed.\r\nGuinea-Bissau supports the international community,\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of African Unity\r\nin their ceaseless search for a peaceful solution to the\r\nproblems affecting our continent. In this context, the\r\nsituation in Angola is of great concern for our country. The\r\ncivil war has imposed great suffering on the majority of the\r\npopulation of Angola, especially those in the most\r\nvulnerable sectors. This situation requires vigorous action\r\non the part of the international community to restore lasting\r\npeace in that neighbouring country. Guinea-Bissau demands\r\nthat UNITA unconditionally abide by the Lusaka Protocol\r\nso as to put an end to this long and painful conflict in that\r\nfraternal country.\r\nIn the Middle East, the peace process between Israel\r\nand Palestine deserves our utmost attention. In this regard,\r\nwe note with satisfaction the positive development in\r\nrelations between Israel and Palestine under the impetus\r\nprovided by the President of the Palestinian Authority,\r\nYasser Arafat, and the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak.\r\nIn Latin America, we hope that the economic and\r\ntrade embargo against Cuba will soon be lifted. We believe\r\nthat the realism of the international community must prevail\r\nso as to spare the Cuban people the suffering that they\r\ncontinue to endure.\r\nWhile it is true that peace and security are an\r\nindispensable condition for social and economic\r\ndevelopment, it is no less true that improving people\u0027s\r\nliving conditions is one of the foundations of social and\r\npolitical stability. However, one of the obstacles to pursuing\r\nthose objectives is our country\u0027s external debt. That is why\r\nthe external debt burden is a matter of constant concern for\r\nGuinea-Bissau. In this context, we welcome the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. We also\r\nwelcome the decisions taken at the G-7 summit recently\r\nheld in Cologne.\r\nWe take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to all\r\nthe organizations in the United Nations system working in\r\nour country for their substantial contribution not only to\r\nconsolidating national peace and reconciliation but to\r\nalleviating the suffering of our people. We also welcome\r\nthe decision to appoint Mr. Samuel Nana-Sinkam as\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General to head\r\nthe United Nations Peace-building Support Office in\r\nGuinea-Bissau, whose activities are greatly appreciated by\r\nour people.\r\nWe believe that we have made sufficiently clear our\r\ndetermination to hold elections on the scheduled date, 28\r\nNovember 1999. However, we know that democracy does\r\nnot end with elections. Support for the special emergency\r\nprogramme for Guinea-Bissau is therefore absolutely\r\nnecessary in order to ensure that the democratic gains are\r\nirreversible and to give sustained development in our\r\ncountry a chance. That is why we take this opportunity to\r\nappeal once more to the international community not only\r\nto take an interest in the elections but also to support the\r\ndetermined efforts of Guinea-Bissau to build its future.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI thank the President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Malam Bacai Sanha, President of the Republic\r\nof Guinea-Bissau, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand, His\r\nExcellency The Right Honourable Donald McKinnon.\r\nMr. McKinnon (New Zealand): First let me\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, on\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly this\r\nsession. I certainly recall my meetings with you and your\r\nPresident in your country last year.\r\nI also wish to welcome three new Members to the\r\nUnited Nations — Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga — all very\r\nclose friends and neighbours of New Zealand. I trust that\r\nthe faith they have shown in the United Nations will be\r\nfulfilled in the years ahead, and we certainly look forward\r\nto working closely with them.\r\nWhen addressing this Assembly, especially as a\r\nrepresentative of a smaller Member State, one is reminded\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nthat the United Nations must remain the fundamental point\r\nof reference in international relations. Indeed, that is a truth\r\nthat all Member States have an obligation to acknowledge.\r\nFurthermore, it is of course sound policy for all who need\r\nand rely on the rule of international law in place of\r\nlawlessness. And it is particularly important to restate it at\r\nthis time. The United Nations collective security\r\nframework, which is one of the fundamental elements of\r\nthe Charter together with cooperation on economic and\r\nsocial problems and promoting respect for human rights,\r\nhas perhaps never been more severely tested than in this\r\nlast year of the twentieth century.\r\nArmed conflicts, many of them internal and ethnically\r\nbased, have continued to present a serious moral challenge\r\nto the international community, and they are likely to do so\r\nfor the foreseeable future. The Security Council\u0027s response\r\nto these problems does not always increase our confidence\r\nin the Organization.\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s remarks in his statement at the\r\nbeginning of this debate about the need to reconcile\r\nuniversal legitimacy with effectiveness in defence of human\r\nrights were most timely. New Zealanders place a very good\r\ndeal of faith in the United Nations: when we see on our\r\ntelevision screens evidence of violence and inhumanity\r\nagainst the vulnerable, and we are told that the Security\r\nCouncil cannot reach an agreement on collective action, we\r\nare left worried, and wondering whether our trust in the\r\nSecurity Council is well placed. A Council which loses the\r\ntrust of the people is a Council which will become\r\nirrelevant.\r\nI want to talk to the Assembly about two extremely\r\nserious challenges the Council faced this year: Kosovo and\r\nEast Timor. Both highlight the importance of the actions of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIn East Timor, following President Habibie\u0027s\r\ncourageous offer to the East Timorese people, prompt and\r\neffective action was taken by the Security Council to set in\r\ntrain the popular consultation process. The ballot —\r\nundertaken in extremely difficult circumstances by highly\r\ncommitted United Nations workers, international and local,\r\nall of whom deserve acclaim — produced a resounding and\r\nincontrovertible expression of the will of the East Timorese\r\npeople. This was the essential basis for the international\r\ncommunity\u0027s response since the ballot.\r\nPost-ballot events were appallingly tragic and have\r\nrightly provoked a strong reaction around the world. The\r\ndispatch to Jakarta and Dili of the Security Council mission\r\nled by Ambassador Andjaba of Namibia was a key step\r\nin addressing this grievous situation. The efforts made by\r\nrepresentatives of all countries present at the time of the\r\nmeeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council\r\nleaders in Auckland, joined by the British Foreign\r\nSecretary representing the European Union, reinforced the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s urging that Indonesia accept the offer\r\nof international help. The assistance could not have come\r\ntoo early.\r\nNew Zealand is proud to be a contributor, alongside\r\nthe forces of other nations from the region and from\r\nfurther afield, and under the leadership of Australia, to the\r\nUnited-Nations-authorized multinational force that is now\r\noperating in East Timor. Our soldiers from New Zealand\r\nare on the ground in East Timor right now. We are\r\nprepared also to take part in the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operation foreshadowed in Security Council\r\nresolution 1264 (1999), and we urge the Council to take\r\nprompt action — next week would not be too soon — to\r\nestablish this operation, which would be part of the\r\nUnited Nations transitional administration in East Timor.\r\nWe are contributing to the efforts of humanitarian\r\nagencies to provide support to the hundreds of thousands\r\nof ordinary people who have been displaced in East\r\nTimor; those currently in West Timor should be speedily\r\nrepatriated. New Zealand has added its voice to those who\r\nbelieve that the people responsible for crimes against\r\nhumanity in East Timor should be brought to account.\r\nThe overriding objective must now be to ensure the\r\nrealization of the 30 August ballot outcome and East\r\nTimor\u0027s transition to independence. It is clear that in\r\nlaying the basis for East Timor\u0027s future, the United\r\nNations will be the indispensable organization.\r\nIt is inevitable that comparison will be made\r\nbetween East Timor and Kosovo. In Kosovo the world\r\nsaw a grave humanitarian crisis with the Security Council\r\nunable to act. In New Zealand\u0027s view, collective action to\r\ntry to put a stop to a humanitarian disaster involving\r\ngenocide and the most serious crimes against humanity\r\nshould never be held hostage to the veto. When it is, the\r\nSecurity Council loses its credibility and its relevance. I\r\nneed hardly reiterate New Zealand\u0027s continuing opposition\r\nto the veto, voiced since San Francisco in 1945. While it\r\nis understandable that national interests will influence\r\nhow members vote in the Security Council, we have\r\nnever accepted that some narrow interests of any one of\r\nfive countries should be able to override the will of a\r\nclear majority of members.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nThe adoption by the Security Council of its resolution\r\n1244 (1999) of 10 June, which provided the international\r\ncommunity\u0027s endorsement of a political solution to the\r\nKosovo conflict, was certainly greeted with much relief in\r\nmost quarters, including in New Zealand. The resolution\r\nwas proof, if any were needed, that the United Nations\r\nremains, as in East Timor, the indispensable organization.\r\nAnd as the Secretary-General observed at the time, it also\r\ngave strong legal underpinning to the task ahead, a task\r\nwhich, he noted, is daunting. The contribution of the\r\ndedicated United Nations and specialized agency staff who\r\nare now working with little fanfare in Kosovo certainly\r\ndeserves our recognition.\r\nBoth Kosovo and East Timor have put the Security\r\nCouncil to the test. In their own ways they have challenged\r\nthis Organization\u0027s capacity to take effective action in the\r\nface of severe difficulties. The world must never again\r\nwitness horrors such as those in Kosovo whilst the Security\r\nCouncil remains impotent. The case of East Timor shows\r\nthat the Security Council can react swiftly and effectively\r\nwhen the will exists. For this to be possible, the fullest\r\ncommitment to support those humanitarian ideals that are\r\nthe basis of the United Nations Charter remains essential.\r\nThe adoption of the Rome Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court shows such a commitment. The\r\ninternational community must now deliver on its promise,\r\nwith signature and early ratification of that Statute.\r\nAs we know, the United Nations also has before it the\r\npressing demands of the various and sometimes interrelated\r\nconflicts throughout Africa with, of course, their appalling\r\nhumanitarian consequences. Who can put out of their minds\r\nthe images of atrocities we have seen from Sierra Leone,\r\nfor instance? Yet the Council\u0027s response has until very\r\nrecently been low-level. Once again, the credibility of the\r\nSecurity Council depends in large part on its being seen as\r\neven-handed in its attention to crises, wherever they may\r\noccur, and whether the Cable News Network (CNN) is\r\nthere or not.\r\nFor much of the past year we have seen the Council\r\nvirtually paralysed on the important question of\r\ndisarmaming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. In the\r\nmeantime, this potentially very serious threat to the security\r\nof the region remains unresolved. The reason again has\r\nbeen the very sharp divisions among the permanent\r\nmembers, which by virtue of the veto power can block any\r\naction. This situation remains unacceptable.\r\nNew Zealand\u0027s awareness of the importance of the\r\nrole of collective action has also been heightened by\r\nrecent events in our own immediate region. Here, the\r\nUnited Nations demonstrated its ability to respond to the\r\ndifferent demands of supporting the regionally inspired\r\npeace process on the island of Bougainville, part of Papua\r\nNew Guinea, and of assessing the needs created by\r\ndisruptions to the population on Guadalcanal in the\r\nSolomon Islands.\r\nThe United Nations must be capable of responding\r\neffectively. Small and vulnerable nations in particular\r\nneed confidence in the United Nations, as it may be their\r\nonly hope in times of trouble. I am very concerned\r\ntherefore by the apparent trend away from financing new\r\npeacekeeping operations by means of assessed\r\ncontributions and an increasing reliance instead on\r\nvoluntary funding. This, of course, poses a threat to the\r\ncollective responsibility that is at the heart of this\r\nOrganization. In practical terms it is likely to mean that\r\nthose regions which fail to attract donor support will not\r\nreceive the response they are entitled to as Members of\r\nthe United Nations. This trend must be urgently reversed;\r\nall operations must be put on an equal financial footing\r\nby means of assessed contributions.\r\nIn addition, as I noted here last year, the largest\r\ncontributor\u0027s arrears to the peacekeeping and regular\r\nbudgets continue to cast a long shadow over the\r\nOrganization. Outstanding dues and very slow payments\r\nto troop contributors affect us all, and can severely\r\nconstrain the ability of countries to contribute to pressing\r\npeacekeeping needs. We call again on those Member\r\nStates who are in dereliction of their obligations to make\r\npayment on time, in full and, of course, without\r\nconditions.\r\nReform of the Security Council remains one of the\r\nmost important items on our agenda. Further useful\r\nprogress has been made this year. While the issue of\r\nenlargement continues to be complex, we believe there\r\nhas existed for some time wide agreement on the equally\r\nimportant areas of reforming the Council\u0027s working\r\nmethods and the curtailing of the veto. The linkage\r\nbetween the veto and enlargement was also explicitly\r\nrecognized in this year\u0027s report to the General Assembly\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council.\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nAs for the task of providing more equitable\r\nrepresentation, I am not convinced that we will be able to\r\nachieve this while the regional groups in the United Nations\r\ncontinue to reflect the political geography of the 1960s.\r\nQuite different and far more sensible arrangements have\r\nbeen adopted in other multilateral forums, as, for example,\r\nin the context of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT). The present system here in New York\r\nlocks in very great disparities in representation. Small\r\ncountries that can make an excellent contribution are often\r\nseverely disadvantaged, especially where a political bloc\r\ninside a regional group may coordinate closely on electoral\r\nmatters.\r\nI would, therefore, wish to add my voice to those of\r\nthe Prime Ministers of Fiji and Samoa and the Foreign\r\nMinisters of Papua New Guinea and Australia, who spoke\r\nearlier in this debate on the need for reconfiguration.\r\nReconfiguration of the regional groups may well hold one\r\nof the keys to an overall package on Security Council\r\nreform.\r\nNew Zealand still looks forward to the day when we\r\ncan join a regional group here in New York which includes\r\nour Asia-Pacific neighbours. In the meantime, we will\r\ncontinue to build linkages in our region and developing the\r\nmany areas of our common understanding.\r\nOne of the great strengths of the General Assembly is\r\nthe equal status ascribed to each Member. All Members,\r\nlarge or small, rich or poor, have a right to be heard here.\r\nEach has a single vote. While we must all from time to\r\ntime temper our own national ambitions in the interests of\r\nreaching a common understanding, we respect the point of\r\nview of each individual member. The special session on\r\nsmall island developing States over the last few days was\r\na very good opportunity to do just that. New Zealand is\r\nfirmly committed to assisting the small island developing\r\nStates SIDS in the spirit of common purpose and\r\npartnership envisaged at Barbados five years ago. We are\r\nvery pleased that all participants in the special session have\r\nreaffirmed their commitment to implement fully the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action.\r\nIn April New Zealand, represented by my colleague,\r\nthe Honourable Simon Upton, had the privilege of chairing\r\nthe seventh session of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. We were pleased to be able to help\r\nreinvigorate debate and build consensus around the need for\r\na more coordinated approach to stewardship of the world\u0027s\r\noceans and the need to recognise, in an ongoing way, the\r\nspecial characteristics and needs of small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nThe Commission faces the great challenge of\r\npursuing the implementation of Agenda 21. Two other\r\ngreat challenges we as a world face on the environmental\r\nfront are the threat of global climate change, caused at\r\nleast in part by human-induced emissions of greenhouse\r\ngases, and the need to maintain an approach to\r\ninternational trade and environmental issues which is\r\nbased on sound scientific analysis and agreed rules and\r\nprocedures. It is vitally important that we should continue\r\nto act in concert to face these international challenges.\r\nInternational cooperation in addressing economic,\r\nsocial and humanitarian problems is, and always will be,\r\none of the cornerstones of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe substantial decline in official development assistance\r\nflows over the last decade is of great concern to many\r\nMember States. In this connection, I am concerned to\r\nnote that the core resources of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) have been greatly\r\nreduced over the past five years, to the point where its\r\nuniversality is seriously threatened. I applaud the efforts\r\nthe new administrator is making to turn this situation\r\naround and to put UNDP on a more secure footing, with\r\nmore clearly defined priorities.\r\nPrivate capital flows to developing countries have\r\nshown major increases. There is a tendency, however, for\r\nsuch investment to be heavily concentrated on a few\r\ncountries where investment prospects seem brightest.\r\nMany developing countries remain vulnerable and can be\r\nall too easily marginalized. Official development\r\nassistance continues to be an essential tool to help build\r\nthe capacity of countries in sectors such as education so\r\nthat they can benefit from the unstoppable phenomenon\r\nof globalization. It is certainly a matter of particular pride\r\nfor me, as New Zealand\u0027s Foreign Minister, to have\r\noverseen increases in New Zealand\u0027s official development\r\nassistance funding effort — up by some 40 per cent since\r\nthe time of the Rio Summit in 1992.\r\nI welcome, also, the positive steps that are being\r\ntaken on the financing for development and debt-relief\r\ninitiatives. It is vital that we continue the dialogue among\r\nMember States and with the international financial\r\ninstitutions to ensure a sounder basis for meeting the\r\nchallenges of international development.\r\nLast year I referred to the important role the United\r\nNations has to play in shaping the moves towards\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nglobalization and the opening up of opportunities for world\r\ntrade. Later this year, in Seattle, we expect to launch a new\r\nround of multilateral trade negotiations. This will clearly\r\nprovide a forum in which to advance trade liberalization\r\nand the rules-based trading system. The role of these\r\nnegotiations in promoting the development prospects of all\r\ncountries and in fostering the integration of least developed\r\ncountries into the global system will be a particular focus.\r\nDeliberations in this Organization at many levels will help\r\nto advance our people\u0027s understanding of the value and\r\npurpose of the global trade agenda and their ability to\r\nbenefit from it. However, I would emphasise the\r\nimportance of major trading partners in continuing to play\r\na leadership role. The adoption of trade restrictions and\r\ndistortions by wealthy economies does much to erode their\r\nmoral authority in the broader debate.\r\nNew Zealand continues to attach the utmost\r\nimportance to seeing all countries work together to bring\r\nabout a world free of nuclear weapons. For this reason we\r\nwere a cosponsor last year of the so-called New Agenda\r\nresolution, which called for faster progress towards the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. The cosponsors will be\r\npresenting this moderate resolution again this year, and we\r\nurge all countries to look carefully at it.\r\nThe Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty will meet in\r\nVienna in a week\u0027s time. I would urge all those countries\r\nwhich have not ratified the Treaty to do so, so that it can\r\nenter into force without further delay.\r\nStrengthening the United Nations remains an important\r\ngoal for New Zealand. I take this opportunity to commend\r\nthe forward-looking management reforms introduced by the\r\nSecretary-General. They have greatly improved policy\r\ncoordination among senior management and have produced\r\npositive, tangible effects throughout the Secretariat.\r\nImproving the way the Organization plans its programmes\r\nand expenditures is a critical next step, where work is\r\nalready under way. There must be a greater focus on results\r\nwhen budgets are prepared in order to promote the best use\r\nof the resources of the Organization, and in turn the best\r\nreturn for Member States.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva\r\nConventions, and last year we commemorated the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nEvents over the past 12 months have shown that challenges\r\nto the values and principles embodied in the Universal\r\nDeclaration remain as daunting as ever. In this\r\ninterdependent world in which we live, New Zealand\r\ncontinues to see the United Nations as central to\r\ninternational efforts to work together to protect and\r\npromote, for all our people, those fundamental human\r\nrights and freedoms to which we are committed under the\r\nUniversal Declaration.\r\nNext year the United Nations will host the\r\nmillennium summit. This symbolic event will provide an\r\nexcellent opportunity for Member States to reaffirm their\r\ncommitment to the ideals of this great Organization.\r\nRecognizing the frailties of our collective performance to\r\ndate, and the critical importance of finding workable\r\nsolutions for the future, I call on all Member States to\r\ntake the opportunities offered by the millennium summit\r\nto enter into open and constructive dialogue and step into\r\nthe next millennium with an unequivocal recommitment\r\nto the visionary principles enshrined in the Charter.\r\nIt is nine years since I first addressed this body in\r\n1991 as the Foreign Minister of New Zealand. For the\r\nUnited Nations, and particularly the Security Council, it\r\nhas been a tumultuous period. After the cold war the\r\nnumber of problems multiplied; the world\u0027s expectations\r\nof what the United Nations could deliver were raised\r\nabove the possible; and the solutions demanded required\r\ndetermination, resolve, tact, understanding and\r\nimagination. The demands on the United Nations will not\r\nlessen, but each year must see a better performance than\r\nin the past. However, as this may well be the last\r\nstatement I make to this body, I want to thank all United\r\nNations officials and peacekeepers everywhere: those I\r\nhave met here in New York; in Cambodia and in\r\nSomalia; in Mozambique; in Bosnia, Croatia and Albania;\r\nin Papua New Guinea and, of course, now in East Timor.\r\nI thank them for their continuing, often unsung and heroic\r\nefforts. They are much appreciated.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Tunisia, His Excellency Mr. Saïd Ben\r\nMustapha.\r\nMr. Ben Mustapha (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwould like first of all to extend to you, Sir, my warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I have no\r\ndoubt that your long diplomatic experience and your deep\r\nknowledge of international relations will enable you to\r\nguide the work of this session to a successful conclusion.\r\nYour election is a token of appreciation from the\r\ninternational community to you personally and to your\r\ncountry, Namibia, which is noted for its prestige in Africa\r\nand in the world. Tunisia, which stood by the fraternal\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nNamibian people in their successful struggle against\r\ncolonialism, is proud of its close ties with your country and\r\nlooks forward to strengthening and developing them further\r\nin the interests of our two countries and peoples.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to express our\r\nsincere gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti,\r\nfor his valuable efforts during his presidency of the fifty-\r\nthird Assembly and for the wise manner in which he\r\nconducted its work, which had a very positive impact on\r\nthe deliberations.\r\nI take this opportunity also to express to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral our great appreciation for his relentless efforts in\r\npromoting and strengthening the pacific, negotiated\r\nsettlement of disputes and crises in various parts of the\r\nworld. We commend him for his dedication to enhancing\r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the Secretariat and to\r\nstrengthening the Organization\u0027s role in meeting\r\nhumankind\u0027s desire for progress, security and peace.\r\nI extend Tunisia\u0027s congratulations to the Republic of\r\nNauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga\r\non their admission to our Organization.\r\nWhat characterizes this session is that it is being held\r\nat the close of a decade that began with the prospect of an\r\nend to the cold war, witnessed the emergence of new\r\nconcepts and future-oriented visions designed to avoid any\r\nrepeat of past errors and crises, and aimed to establish a\r\nnew world order based on security, peace, cooperation and\r\nstability. Although optimism marked the early stages of this\r\nnew era, subsequent developments have compelled the\r\ninternational community to conduct a comprehensive review\r\nof the immediate past in order to solve the various\r\ndifficulties and problems of our world today.\r\nAs we meet during this session at the dawn of the\r\ntwenty-first century, we have a propitious opportunity to\r\ndiscuss and exchange views about various possible methods\r\nfor amending the approach that we have taken over the last\r\nfew years and identifying its weaknesses and deficiencies.\r\nWe must then devise a renewed approach that will provide\r\nfuture generations with the capacity to adapt, overcome\r\nobstacles, preserve international peace and security and\r\nensure well-being and prosperity for all humanity.\r\nFor the framework of such a renewed approach to\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, we have in\r\nmind three main themes. First, the change that has taken\r\nplace in the approach to armaments and to their role in the\r\nworld. Secondly, the growing need for increased attention\r\nto settling regional disputes. Thirdly, the transformation\r\nof economic and social development into one of the\r\ncornerstones of peace and security globally. Despite the\r\ngreat strides which the international community has made\r\nin these three areas, much remains to be done before we\r\nachieve the goal of a qualitative transition that would\r\nallow us to guarantee security and tranquillity for all\r\npeople and for the generations to come.\r\nOur world possesses huge arsenals of weapons,\r\nespecially weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons\r\nforemost among them. It is extremely important, in our\r\nview, for the nuclear Powers to take rapid steps to\r\neliminate these weapons, especially given the limits of the\r\ncurrent non-proliferation regime in the long term and the\r\nimpossibility of contemplating non-proliferation as a\r\nsubstitute for completely dismantling and destroying all\r\nnuclear weapons and banning them in the future.\r\nWe believe that as we move closer to the twenty-\r\nfirst century, the international community has a historic\r\nopportunity to achieve this noble goal or at least to\r\nconclude an agreement on nuclear disarmament. In\r\nworking towards this goal, it is extremely important to\r\nensure that non-nuclear weapon States are not subject to\r\nthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in violation of\r\ntheir security and territorial integrity. Consideration must\r\nbe given to the fact that non-nuclear-weapon States\r\nconstitute the overwhelming majority of Member States\r\nand have freely chosen not to possess nuclear weapons.\r\nWe would like, in this regard, to address another\r\naspect of disarmament: small arms. We all know how\r\ndestructive small arms can be. Tunisia supports all\r\ninternational efforts to curb small arms proliferation and\r\ntrafficking.\r\nTunisia, which has abided by all disarmament\r\ntreaties and conventions, reiterates its total commitment\r\nto the disarmament objectives and its strong resolve to\r\ncontinue contributing towards the achievement of these\r\ngoals in the various relevant fora, especially the\r\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva. Tunisia recently\r\nhad the honour of joining the Conference, following the\r\nConference\u0027s decision last August to expand its\r\nmembership by admitting five new countries.\r\nIn implementation of the Ottawa Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, Tunisia destroyed large quantities of mines\r\nduring an official ceremony on 29 June 1999 attended by\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\na representative of the United Nations in Tunis. We hope\r\nthat all States parties to the Convention will participate in\r\nthe Convention process without delay so that the\r\nConvention\u0027s objectives are achieved and transparency is\r\npromoted pursuant to the Convention\u0027s article 7.\r\nThe outbreak and persistence of conflicts in many\r\nparts of the world compel our Organization to be constantly\r\nready to assume its responsibilities and to play the role it\r\nhas been assigned in this regard by the Charter. We believe\r\nthat the efforts aimed at consolidating preventive\r\ndiplomacy, collective security, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes and adherence to international legality are\r\nfoundations of international peace and security and should\r\nbe further upheld.\r\nHowever, despite the numerous successes of our\r\nOrganization in this field, there are still many hotbeds of\r\ntension and war that require more coordination and\r\ncooperation if they are to be curbed and prevented from\r\nspreading. I should like in this regard to address the\r\nquestion of so-called “humanitarian intervention”. This is a\r\nsensitive and delicate issue. It requires, in our view, a\r\nthorough and profound analysis taking into account all its\r\naspects, especially those related, first, to the sovereignty of\r\nStates and the need to preserve it as a natural right\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations as a\r\nfundamental element of international relations; and,\r\nsecondly, the necessity to save the lives of civilian\r\npopulations in times of conflict, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of international solidarity.\r\nAll States Members of the Organization are called\r\nupon to consider all the implications of these principles in\r\norder to reach consensus on this issue and to contribute in\r\na considered and balanced way to the debate on it. Such a\r\ndebate should not be confined to the Security Council, but\r\nshould also involve the General Assembly.\r\nThe issues related to the security problems confronting\r\nthe African continent should remain at the top of our\r\npriorities. These issues need the strong material and\r\nfinancial support of the international community if they are\r\nto be resolved. Africa, in turn, has given top priority to the\r\nquestion of the settlement of internal disputes. The\r\nOrganization of African Unity Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution has played an\r\nimportant role in this regard. Since its inception, the\r\nMechanism has achieved encouraging results that reflect the\r\ndetermination of African countries to rely, first and\r\nforemost, on their own capacity to solve the problems that\r\nthreaten the security of the continent, in full coordination\r\nwith the United Nations. Given its importance, the\r\nMechanism needs stronger financial and technical support\r\nfrom the international community, which would help to\r\nenhance its capacities and to develop its effectiveness and\r\nefficiency.\r\nWe must stress in this regard the extreme importance\r\nof development, a basic guarantor of lasting security.\r\nIndeed, there can be no stability without sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Despite the relentless efforts of African\r\ncountries in the political, economic and social fields\r\naimed at improving the situation of their peoples, there\r\nare still many difficulties that prevent many countries\r\nfrom implementing their development programmes.\r\nIt has become a matter of urgency that the African\r\ncontinent receive strong and continuous support on the\r\nbasis of its national priorities. We note in this regard that\r\nthe initiative of the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly to convene meetings to discuss and follow up\r\nthe situation in Africa bears testimony to a growing and\r\nconsolidated awareness of the need to address African\r\nproblems. While commending this approach, we must\r\nemphasize the need to adopt practical plans which\r\nAfrica\u0027s partners can translate into concrete realities in an\r\neffective manner.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe commend the various initiatives of the United\r\nNations, its specialized agencies and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions to promote sustainable development in Africa.\r\nWe believe, however, that it is important to ensure\r\ncoordination between United Nations initiatives and those\r\nundertaken by donor countries if such initiatives are to\r\nsucceed. In this framework, we look forward to the\r\nadoption of practical initiatives that respond to the\r\nproposals spelt out in the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of sustainable\r\npeace and development in Africa, particularly regarding\r\nthe debt problem.\r\nIn Tunisia, we are aware of the important role that\r\neconomic and geographical groupings play in today\u0027s\r\nworld in addressing the challenges posed by globalization\r\nand in adapting to constant important changes. This\r\nawareness prompts us to pursue our endeavours, along\r\nwith our brothers in the Maghreb countries, to complete\r\nthe establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union, which\r\nremains a strategic and firm choice and which also\r\nrepresents the aspirations of the people of our region to\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nprosperity, security and integration. This choice is even\r\nmore pressing in the light of our country\u0027s endeavours to set\r\nup a Euro-Mediterranean space as a framework for\r\ncooperation between all Mediterranean countries, for\r\nsolidarity between its peoples and for a cultural and social\r\ndialogue on the basis of the noble values and high\r\nprinciples in which we all believe.\r\nWith respect to the Middle East, where the conflict\r\nhas lasted more than half a century, peace, which is\r\ncherished by the peoples of that region and indeed by the\r\nwhole world, still faces difficulties despite the efforts that\r\nhave been made by the international community,\r\nparticularly since the early 1970s. There is no doubt that a\r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace is the only way to\r\nconsolidate the foundations of stability and security and to\r\nenable all parties to devote their resources and energies to\r\nthe development efforts of their countries and to ensuring\r\nthe well-being of their peoples.\r\nTunisia has followed with satisfaction the new\r\ndevelopments brought about by the signing of the Sharm el-\r\nSheikh Memorandum, which has created a new encouraging\r\nclimate for the reactivation of the peace process and the\r\nfaithful and full implementation of all agreements and\r\ncommitments. We hope that the final status negotiations\r\nwill lead to the resolution of the most important issues,\r\nparticularly the recognition of the inalienable rights of the\r\nPalestinian people, in particular its right to establish an\r\nindependent State on its land, with Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nOn the basis of this firm position of principle in\r\nsupport of the peace process, and eager as it is to see the\r\npeace process succeed on all tracks, Tunisia insists on the\r\nimportance of reactivating negotiations on the Syrian and\r\nLebanese tracks from the point at which they stopped, as\r\nwell as on the necessity of the complete and unconditional\r\nwithdrawal of Israel from South Lebanon and from the\r\nSyrian Golan Heights, in compliance with the relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions and on the basis of the principle\r\nof land for peace. Occupation and peace cannot co-exist.\r\nRegarding the Lockerbie issue, Tunisia expresses its\r\nsatisfaction at the recent positive developments, to which it\r\nand other parties of good will contributed. It also reiterates\r\nits call for a speedy and final lifting of the embargo\r\nimposed on the brotherly Libyan people.\r\nWith respect to the question of Iraq, Tunisia reiterates\r\nits call for a peaceful solution in the context of international\r\nresolutions. It also calls upon the international community\r\nto join efforts to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi\r\npeople so that all the efforts of the peoples of that region\r\ncan be directed towards development and the promotion\r\nof stability. Thus, Tunisia, which has called for respect\r\nfor international legality, expresses the hope that a\r\nsolution will soon be found to all the humanitarian issues\r\nresulting from this tragedy, particularly the question of\r\nKuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons, in\r\nconformity with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nRegarding the question of the three islands of\r\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, Tunisia\r\nreiterates its support for the resolution of this dispute\r\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and Iran through\r\npeaceful means, either through direct dialogue or, if that\r\nshould prove impossible, by referring the question to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nIn another region of the world, the international\r\ncommunity has focused its attention in recent months on\r\nanother important question, that of East Timor. In this\r\nregard, we welcome the adoption of Security Council\r\nresolution 1264 (1999) and hope that its implementation\r\nwill enable the people of East Timor to achieve self-\r\ndetermination and will, at the same time, maintain\r\nsecurity in the region and preserve the sovereignty and\r\nintegrity of Indonesia. We commend Indonesia\u0027s courage\r\nin responding to the wishes of the people of East Timor\r\nand the international community. We believe that a final\r\nsettlement of this issue can be achieved only in an\r\natmosphere of conciliation that involves all parties\r\nconcerned, and with the support and blessing of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nOne of the most important phenomena characterizing\r\nthe end of this century is the growing globalization that\r\nnow dominates various aspects of our social life.\r\nAlthough it has created new opportunities in the field of\r\neconomic development, it is likely, if not brought under\r\ncontrol, to lead to further disruption in international\r\nrelations and development plans. The international\r\ncommunity must seriously and firmly address the\r\nchallenges posed by globalization. This entails the\r\ndemonstration of stronger political will from all parties\r\nand the implementation of all the commitments made,\r\nparticularly at the important conferences of the United\r\nNations.\r\nFollow-up and implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of international conferences is, in our\r\nopinion, of great importance. In this regard, we would\r\nlike to express our satisfaction with the continuing work\r\nof the preparatory Committees for the two special\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nsessions of the General Assembly to review and appraise\r\nimplementation of the Beijing Platform of Action dealing\r\nwith women\u0027s and family issues and of the Copenhagen\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development, which will be held\r\nin June, in New York and Geneva respectively. However,\r\nwe note with concern that, despite the efforts made at the\r\nUnited Nations, which has placed the eradication of poverty\r\nhigh on its agenda, the agreed target set at the Copenhagen\r\nSummit for increasing the amount of official development\r\nassistance to 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of\r\ndeveloped countries has not yet been met.\r\nThis situation requires action at the international level\r\naimed at achieving solidarity, which we consider an\r\nessential link between peoples. In this context we place the\r\nrecent call by His Excellency Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Tunisia, to all world leaders\r\nand to various United Nations and other international\r\ninstitutions for the creation of a world solidarity fund. The\r\nobjective of this fund would be to collect voluntary\r\ndonations and contributions to be used in the fight against\r\npoverty and in the development of the poorest regions in\r\nvarious parts of the world, particularly in the least\r\ndeveloped countries that undergo various tragedies and\r\ncrises. Our country will endeavour, through its contacts\r\nwith brotherly and friendly countries and at the United\r\nNations and other international organizations, to rally the\r\nnecessary support for this noble humanitarian project and\r\nfor the elaboration of modalities for its creation as soon as\r\npossible. This will enable us to be more responsive to our\r\noptions and commitments, which have gained the\r\nacceptance of the international community and which have\r\nbeen set forth in the recommendations of various\r\ninternational conferences.\r\nWe also rely on United Nations institutions, such as\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations\r\nChildren\u0027s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population\r\nFund (UNFPA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of\r\nthe United Nations (FAO) and other institutions in view of\r\ntheir prestige and experience as well as their interest in the\r\nfight against poverty, to contribute efficiently to the speedy\r\ncreation of this fund.\r\nThe year 1999 represents a new landmark in the\r\nconsolidation of the democratic process in Tunisia. It will\r\nbe marked by pluralistic presidential and parliamentary\r\nelections based on full transparency and freedom of choice\r\nfor citizens within the context of freedom and respect for\r\nlaw. Tunisia has undertaken a programme of substantial\r\nreforms over the past 12 years in different areas, having\r\namended the Constitution, allowing political pluralism and\r\na multiparty system, eliminating special courts and\r\nenacting legislation in conformity with our obligations to\r\ninternational treaties in the field of human rights, which\r\nTunisia has been among the first countries to ratify.\r\nIn the same spirit, Tunisia has long undertaken to\r\npromote women\u0027s freedom and gender equality. It\r\npublishes a special journal on children\u0027s rights and a code\r\non the care and rights of the elderly, handicapped and\r\nother vulnerable categories. All these reforms embody\r\nTunisia\u0027s global vision regarding all dimensions of human\r\nrights and confirm our country\u0027s strong belief in the\r\nuniversality of such principles.\r\nThe creation of many multilateral organizations,\r\nparticularly the United Nations, represents the most\r\nimportant achievement of the international community in\r\nthis century. Thanks to the solid institutional edifice in\r\nwhich our Organization holds a privileged place, rules\r\nregulating relations between States have been codified,\r\nand common objectives, programmes and strategies have\r\nbeen elaborated in order to address the problems\r\nconfronting the world.\r\nDespite the successes and achievements in this\r\nregard, certain weaknesses still mark international\r\nrelations, and various new disruptions and dangers have\r\nemerged. In the context of all the developments and\r\nchanges that have occurred, the United Nations remains\r\nthe ideal forum and haven for the elaboration of collective\r\nstrategies to overcome challenges.\r\nWe believe that the millennium summit, to be held\r\nduring the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly,\r\nconstitutes an ideal opportunity, which the international\r\ncommunity should fully utilize, evaluate its\r\naccomplishments and build a strategy based on them in\r\norder to usher in the new millennium with diligence and\r\nconfidence. That summit will also be a historic occasion\r\nfor heads of State and Government to debate this matter.\r\nIn this regard, we believe that the Organization\r\nneeds to be provided with all the necessary means to play\r\nan effective role in international relations and affairs.\r\nReforming the Organization and its various structures on\r\nthe basis of the developments and changes that have\r\noccurred will certainly ensure its vitality. Among the\r\nurgent tasks that the Member States need to address today\r\nis to reform the Security Council in a way that would\r\nreflect the profound changes the international community\r\nhas witnessed, ensure global representation in this vital\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nbody and consolidate the principles of transparency and\r\ndemocracy in its working methods.\r\nWe need to stress, in this context, that we expect the\r\nreform of the Security Council to lead to the fulfilment of\r\nthe requests of developing countries, primarily African\r\ncountries, to have permanent representation on the Security\r\nCouncil, which would allow them to contribute to the tasks\r\nand responsibilities assigned to this body in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the full\r\ncommitment of Tunisia to the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations as enshrined in the Charter, the same\r\npurposes and principles it has adopted and implemented in\r\nits foreign policy. Tunisia is a peace-loving and justice-\r\nloving nation. It has endeavoured relentlessly since its\r\nadmission to this body, and in all the forums to which it\r\nbelongs, to contribute with all the means at its disposal to\r\nstrengthen the foundations of international peace and\r\nsecurity. It makes every effort to encourage dialogue and\r\nnegotiations as the proper means for the settlement of\r\ndisputes and crises. It has participated in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations since the early 1960s and presently\r\ncontributes to three of them. Last June Tunisia signed with\r\nthe United Nations an agreement that would place standby\r\nforces at the disposal of the Organization.\r\nTunisia spares no effort in contributing to all\r\ninitiatives aimed at promoting cooperation, solidarity and\r\nunderstanding between countries and peoples. That is the\r\ndirection we have freely chosen and that we intend to\r\npursue if and when my country is given the honour of\r\nbeing elected to a non-permanent seat on the Security\r\nCouncil for the period 2000-2001 by the Member States\r\nand with the full support of the brotherly African Group,\r\nother groups and friendly countries. We look forward to the\r\nsupport of all Member States so that my country can\r\ncontinue working with them towards fulfilling the task of\r\nadvancing the purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call on\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Armenia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Vartan Oskanian.\r\nMr. Oskanian (Armenia): May I begin by\r\ncongratulating the President on his election. I am confident\r\nthat the skills and vast experience he has acquired\r\nthroughout his distinguished diplomatic career will provide\r\nthe guidance we need to guarantee the successful outcome\r\nof the session. I must also recall the valuable contribution\r\nof his predecessor, Mr. Opertti, to the work of the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to extend my\r\nwarm welcome and congratulations to the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga on their admission to the United Nations.\r\nAs the twentieth century comes to an end, it is\r\nevident that all countries in the world — advanced,\r\ndeveloping or transitional — will be substantially affected\r\nby globalization. Further specialization and the widening\r\nof markets through trade, the larger division of labour and\r\na more efficient and diversified allocation of financial\r\nresources should increase overall productivity and raise\r\nliving standards. However, no country will benefit from\r\nthis trend spontaneously and automatically. The major\r\ntasks which Governments face today are development and\r\nthe pursuit of sound policies and appropriate structural\r\nadjustments to meet the challenges and take advantage of\r\nthe opportunities that globalization offers. While sound\r\ndomestic economic planning and reforms are critical to\r\nmeeting the challenges of globalization, regional\r\ncooperation and integration processes are essential to\r\nmaximizing the emerging benefits and opportunities.\r\nWe, as a country and the region as a whole, are\r\ntrying to adjust to the multiple stresses of post-Soviet\r\neconomic, cultural and political transformations. Clearly\r\nthese problems can stress relations as much within States\r\nas between them. Armenia does not see either itself or the\r\nregion as being permanently condemned to\r\nmarginalization; rather, it believes that close cooperation\r\nin the region, whether political, economic or security\r\nbased, will help bring lasting stability and prosperity\r\nbased on a sense of solid and shared emergent values.\r\nCooperation within the framework of regional economic\r\ninitiatives, such as the Interstate Oil and Gas Transport to\r\nEurope (INOGATE) programme and the Transport\r\nCorridor: Europe-Caucusus-Asia (TRACECA) project, is\r\nessential. Armenia is sincerely open to such cooperation,\r\nalthough we have to state with regret that the blockades\r\nimposed on Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan are a\r\nserious obstacle to such cooperation. It is obvious that the\r\nregion\u0027s high potential cannot be fully utilized if attempts\r\nare made to isolate one of its constituents. Such attempts\r\nare doomed to failure and will adversely affect all\r\nconcerned in the region.\r\nThe Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) is\r\nanother mechanism that could contribute to the region\u0027s\r\neconomic development. The activities of the recently\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nestablished Black Sea Trade and Development Bank will\r\nconsiderably contribute to carrying out the projects\r\nelaborated by the member States of the Black Sea\r\nEconomic Cooperation. In this regard, Armenia fully\r\nsupports the granting of observer status in the General\r\nAssembly to the BSEC.\r\nA young republic in transition from a long nightmare\r\nof totalitarian, single-party State to the emergence of a\r\ndemocratic, free-market, open society, Armenia must\r\nsimultaneously consolidate its State structures, move its\r\neconomy forward and resolve the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nconflict. It must do all three at the same time, for they are\r\nin fact interdependent. First and foremost, Armenia must\r\nensure that the Armenian population of Nagorny Karabakh\r\ncontinues to enjoy its security within its own lands. Our\r\nrecent memories of vulnerability and insecurity make it\r\nimpossible for any Armenian anywhere to accept anything\r\nless than the inalienable right of the people of Nagorny\r\nKarabakh not to be subjugated, not to be dominated and not\r\nto be subordinate. Armenia understands this and is actively\r\nengaged in pursuing in every possible forum a resolution of\r\nthe conflict with Azerbaijan that would achieve peace\r\nwithout endangering the hard-won and legitimate rights of\r\nour own people to live in secure dignity and freedom.\r\nSince 1992 the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) has played a key role in the\r\nprocess of finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in\r\nNagorny Karabakh. It has been actively involved, through\r\nthe various permutations of the Minsk process, to define the\r\nelements for a durable peace and stability in the region of\r\nthe Transcaucasus. Armenia is committed to pursuing every\r\npossible and credible attempt to resolve the conflicts that\r\nlinger in the region. It is committed to exploring every\r\navenue for peaceful relations with all its neighbours,\r\nrelations based on mutual respect and recognition.\r\nThe OSCE, through the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk\r\nGroup, is trying to reconcile seemingly incompatible\r\nprinciples. We have always remained opposed to one-sided\r\northodoxy and have always advocated a more flexible\r\napproach. It is therefore with interest that Armenia and\r\nNagorny Karabakh received the Minsk Group\r\nCo-Chairmen\u0027s draft proposal during their latest visit to the\r\nregion. My Government, as well as the authorities of\r\nNagorny Karabakh, considered this formulation by the\r\nCo-Chairmen a more realistic effort in trying to address the\r\nthorny issue of the status of Nagorny Karabakh with\r\nminimal prejudice to either of the competing claims.\r\nIndeed, we must distinguish between stability and\r\nthe forced maintenance of the status quo. Conflating the\r\ntwo is neither wise nor practicable in the long run. A\r\nstatus quo in political life is never inherently permanent,\r\nand a viable policy of stability requires a mechanism to\r\npursue an evolutionary, dynamic process of managing\r\nchange. We have new and dynamic challenges to the\r\nstatus quo; we should not be shy in addressing these\r\nchallenges creatively and objectively to conceive more\r\nadaptive answers rather than falling back into a\r\ncomfortable, yet dangerously elusive, status quo.\r\nAs Armenia actively defends and pursues the\r\nNagorny Karabakh people\u0027s right to self-determination\r\nthrough peaceful means, we also sympathize with and\r\nsupport all other just self-determination claims in other\r\nparts of the globe. Armenia applauded the Indonesian\r\nGovernment\u0027s courage when it announced the conduct of\r\nthe referendum on East Timor\u0027s independence. Today we\r\nare concerned with the latest developments, but we hope\r\nthat the results of the popular consultation will be fully\r\nrespected. We also commend the role that the United\r\nNations has played in organizing and supervising the\r\npopular consultation.\r\nArmenia also welcomes the most recent positive\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East peace process. We hope\r\nthat the Palestinian people\u0027s right to self-determination\r\nwill be fully realized, thus bringing lasting peace and\r\nstability to the Middle East.\r\nThe last decade of the twentieth century has been\r\nmarked by serious achievements in the sphere of\r\ndisarmament and global and regional arms control, and\r\nmore remains to be done. At the global level, that would\r\nmean reviewing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) in the year 2000; completing the\r\nwork of the Biological Weapons Convention Ad Hoc\r\nGroup on a compliance and verification protocol;\r\ncompletely eliminating existing stocks of chemical\r\nweapons and ensuring the universality of the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention regime. Similarly, at the regional\r\nlevel, we attach great importance to the successful\r\nconclusion of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces\r\nin Europe (CFE) adaptation process, which will be signed\r\nby heads of States at the OSCE summit this November.\r\nWe are convinced that the adapted Treaty will\r\nsignificantly contribute to the strengthening of European\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn pursuing its national policies, Armenia has made\r\nit a priority to support the international efforts in securing\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\npeace and stability throughout the world. We believe that\r\nour full participation in the work of the Conference on\r\nDisarmament will allow us to make further contributions to\r\nthe issues of arms control and disarmament. We hope\r\nmembers will support Armenia in its willingness to become\r\na full member of the Conference on Disarmament.\r\nArmenia welcomes the millennium summit initiative.\r\nAt the threshold of the new millennium, it is important for\r\nheads of State and Government to discuss the tasks that the\r\nUnited Nations is going to undertake in providing global\r\npeace and security. Believing that the United Nations\r\nshould play the leading role in the formation of an\r\ninternational anti-criminal strategy, Armenia supports the\r\nidea of holding, in Vienna in the year 2000, the Tenth\r\nUnited Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and the\r\nTreatment of Offenders.\r\nWe call for the accession of the maximum number of\r\ncountries to universal conventions against terrorism and\r\nsupport the Russian proposal on a United Nations\r\nconvention for combating acts of nuclear terrorism.\r\nArmenia, likewise, supports the initiative of holding a\r\nconference or a special session of the General Assembly\r\nagainst terrorism in 2000.\r\nOn 1 October, Armenia will sign the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, thus becoming the eighty-\r\nseventh State to do so.\r\nMaintenance of international peace is one of the most\r\nimportant functions of the United Nations. The challenges\r\nthat the international community faces today are diverse and\r\ncomplicated. This holds true especially for the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, since ensuring peace and security\r\nthroughout the world depends on a Security Council which\r\nfunctions effectively. Security Council resolutions, including\r\nthose on peacekeeping operations, should be unbiased and\r\nuniversal and reflect a common approach to conflicts, based\r\non internationally accepted principles and criteria. One way\r\nto strengthen the role and function of the Security Council\r\nis to ensure a more equitable representation of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations in that organ, in\r\naccordance with the sovereign equality of States and other\r\nrelevant provisions of the Charter, and to make its work\r\nmore transparent. Representation in the Security Council\r\nthat is more equitable can be achieved by increasing the\r\nnumber of its members, taking into account the growth in\r\nthe membership of the United Nations.\r\nAfter this brief comment on matters that concern\r\nArmenia\u0027s current affairs, its membership in the United\r\nNations and the outstanding issues of the Nagorny\r\nKarabakh conflict, allow me a moment of reflection. We\r\nare often so preoccupied by immediate crises that\r\nlingering, chronic and fundamental phenomena do not\r\nalways get our full attention.\r\nAt this end of the century and millennium and on\r\nthe threshold of a new era, we would not be candid if we\r\ndid not admit to a certain disappointment, a certain sad\r\nrecognition that we, as a collectivity, a community of\r\nnations, have not come as far as people everywhere\r\nwould have wished us to come. I am sure we are not\r\nalone in our disappointment as we look around us and see\r\nthat the hopes of 1989 have not been fully realized in the\r\nlast 10 years: Rwanda, Kosovo and East Timor are all,\r\nhistorically speaking, very much in the present.\r\nIt is not for lack of charters, conventions and\r\nuniversal declarations that tragic events and murderous\r\nactions are committed, often by States, and even in the\r\nname of those same charters, conventions and\r\ndeclarations. After the Second World War, after the end\r\nof the cold war, we might have been justified in expecting\r\nsome respite from the organized display of man\u0027s\r\ninhumanity to man, of fratricidal war between citizens\r\nand State attempts to exterminate some part of its own\r\npeople. But of course very recent experience tells us that\r\nthe persecution of innocent civilians on no other grounds\r\nthan their ethnicity, religion or national origin continues\r\nunabated.\r\nArmenia and Armenians have a unique history\r\nthrough which to interpret these events. We notice the\r\never more frequent use of the term “genocide” in\r\ncontinent after continent and we are reminded of our own\r\ntragic experience as genocide victims at the beginning of\r\nthis century. It is sad but true that the genocide of\r\nArmenians, which began in 1915, opened this century of\r\nhorrors. We at least are convinced that nothing contributes\r\nas much to the repetition of horrors as the reluctance and\r\nunwillingness with which those complicit in them tell the\r\ntruth, or even their avoiding doing so at all. Denying the\r\nreality of evil, portraying it as merely relative and\r\nrendering it banal have done much to have evil seen as a\r\npolitical event to manipulate and equivocate and\r\nprevaricate about in the name of realpolitik.\r\nIn Armenia, our democracy and future prosperity\r\ndepend on there coming a time when, through peace, the\r\nCaucasus will fulfil its promise as a region of neighbourly\r\ncooperation and economic growth. Without regional\r\npolitical stability, the regional economic prospects for all\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\ncountries of the Caucasus will remain precarious. And\r\nunless the security needs and the aspirations of the people\r\nof the region are satisfied, there can be no political\r\nstability.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call\r\non the Minister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nCooperation and Francophonie of Gabon, His Excellency\r\nMr. Jean Ping.\r\nMr. Ping (spoke in French): I am pleased to convey\r\nto the President on behalf of the delegation of Gabon, our\r\nwarmest congratulations on his well-deserved election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. In addition to the tribute his election pays to\r\nNamibia, it is eloquent testimony to both his personal and\r\nprofessional qualities. We hardly need to point out that he\r\nwas one of the principal architects of Namibia\u0027s\r\nindependence. Today, the President has the honour of\r\npresiding over the last Assembly session of the century and\r\nof leading the United Nations towards the new millennium.\r\nAllow me through you to assure him of my delegation\u0027s\r\ncomplete and wholehearted cooperation.\r\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Uruguay, I extend my deepest gratitude\r\nfor the work accomplished during his term of office.\r\nI congratulate the Secretary-General for his initiatives\r\nand actions towards peace and security worldwide.\r\nTo the three new Member States, the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga,\r\nwhich have just joined the great United Nations family, I\r\nconvey my warmest congratulations.\r\nI am convinced that this session will enable us to\r\nshare our thoughts on the increasingly complex challenges\r\nthat our Organization must face if it is to create the\r\nnecessary conditions for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and for economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe are entering a major period of transition marked\r\nby the end of one century and the beginning of another,\r\nso it is beyond necessary for the international community\r\nto see to it that the new millennium is spared the scourges\r\nthat sap humankind\u0027s strength.\r\nDuring this century that is now coming to its end,\r\nthe world has undergone a rapid acceleration in the pace\r\nof history and a thorough transformation as a result of\r\ncombined effects of the explosion in the numbers of new\r\ntechnologies, the expansion of trade and the breathtaking\r\nincrease in the role played by markets. The scale of this\r\ntransformation, which affects all aspects of people\u0027s lives,\r\nis today so great that no nation can escape its influence.\r\nUnfortunately, nations are not all in the same boat:\r\nsome steadily accumulate progress and prosperity while\r\nothers seem destined to a bottomless pit of destitution. I\r\nam thinking here specifically about the African countries\r\nwhich, unlike the rest of the world, have not yet taken\r\nadvantage of the profound changes in the world, and\r\nwhose access to the so often trumpeted shared prosperity\r\nis denied. I am thinking also about one and a half billion\r\nmen and women around the world who live on less than\r\na dollar a day, and the billion adults who can neither read\r\nnor write. I am thinking too about the 300 million\r\nAfricans who eke out their lives in a state of abject\r\npoverty on the outer margins of the global village.\r\nAdd to this bleak picture the heavy burden of debt,\r\nwhich is strangling our economies, compromising any\r\nattempt at development and reducing us to the level of\r\nmodern-day slaves at the tender mercy of our creditors.\r\nThe budgetary resources allocated to service external\r\ndebt overwhelm all efforts to meet the most basic needs\r\nof our people. It is therefore crucial that the recurring\r\nproblem of debt should be considered not only in terms\r\nof socio-economic indicators but also taking into account\r\na State\u0027s efforts to combat poverty.\r\nWhile welcoming the recent initiative undertaken at\r\nCologne by the Group of Seven and Russia with a view\r\nto cancelling the debt of the most heavily indebted\r\ncountries, the Government of Gabon is nevertheless\r\ndisappointed by the fact that the eligibility criteria for\r\nthose countries are so restrictive; for it must be recalled\r\nthat debt, like poverty, is a constant threat to the stability\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nof States. Therefore, the burning question of global\r\nproportions that we must all face is how to take advantage,\r\nboth individually and collectively, of the current prodigious\r\nglobal prosperity and the enormous accumulation of wealth\r\ncreated by globalization in order to substantially reduce the\r\npoverty of nations and of their people.\r\nAs the Minister Fischer of Germany said recently,\r\n“Africa must not be a loser in globalization. The\r\nrich countries of the North have not only a duty, but\r\nalso an interest, in assisting their poorest neighbours\r\nin the southern hemisphere to seize the opportunities\r\nthat globalization offers them and to allow them to\r\nparticipate more equitably in the global economy”.\r\nMy country feels that the time has come for the\r\ninternational community to seriously tackle the unavoidable\r\nproblem of the eradication of poverty, at least in its most\r\nextreme form. We share the firm conviction that our\r\nOrganization must promote, in the words of the Charter,\r\n“higher standards of living, full employment, and\r\nconditions of economic and social progress and\r\ndevelopment”.\r\nThis would be the first step towards eliminating the\r\nimbalances that are among the underlying causes of many\r\nconflicts around the world, for a world in which some make\r\nprogress while others fall behind carries within it the seeds\r\nof its own instability. Can we therefore move towards a\r\nnew concept of the idea of security that no longer focuses\r\non the security of nations alone, but that focuses above all\r\non the well-being of peoples? The sine qua non condition\r\nfor sparing future generations from the scourge of war is to\r\nmove from a culture of war towards a culture of peace.\r\nThere are genuine reasons to be concerned about peace\r\nand stability in the world. Maintaining international peace\r\nand security, a task assigned to our Organization, has been\r\nseverely put to the test by the outbreak and persistence of\r\na number of crises. In this regard, Africa has become the\r\nmain theatre of these devastating crises, which result in\r\ncountless victims, refugees and displaced persons.\r\nIn spite of this regrettable situation, we have seen\r\nsome encouraging signs concerning the restoration of peace\r\nin certain African subregions. The recent signing of the\r\npeace Agreement by all the parties to the conflict in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, including all the rebel\r\nmovements, now opens up the way for a lasting settlement\r\nof the conflict. We urge all the parties to translate into\r\naction the will they expressed in signing the Lusaka\r\nAgreement on 10 July 1999. It is now urgent for the\r\ninternational community, and for the Security Council in\r\nparticular, to take the necessary steps for the full\r\nimplementation of the Agreement without delay.\r\nIn the neighbouring Republic of the Congo, the\r\nauthorities have again recently expressed their willingness\r\nto engage in dialogue with the opposition. In return, the\r\nopposition has also made clear its intention to take part in\r\nan inter-Congolese dialogue in order to achieve lasting\r\npeace.\r\nThe recent Lomé Agreement on Sierra Leone is also\r\na positive sign of a return of lasting peace to that country.\r\nMy country is pleased with the resumption of the\r\npeace process in the Middle East and urges the complete\r\napplication of the Wye Plantation agreements, as well as\r\nfull compliance with the agreements signed in the past.\r\nDespite all of this progress, we cannot overlook the\r\nfact that important efforts still have to made in Angola as\r\na result of UNITA\u0027s refusal to implement the Lusaka\r\nagreements.\r\nLikewise, despite the prospects that are beginning to\r\nappear, the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea\r\nstill remains a burning issue.\r\nAccording to the most recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Somalia is, unfortunately, still without State\r\ninstitutions. The time has come to reintegrate that country\r\ninto the concert of nations.\r\nGuaranteeing lasting peace and security is today a\r\ncollective matter. Although the primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of peace falls to the Security Council, it\r\nis appropriate for the United Nations to encourage the\r\ndevelopment of regional peacekeeping and security\r\nmechanisms, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter. Significant progress has been made in Central\r\nAfrica in preventing and managing conflicts within the\r\nframework of the United Nations Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa. The\r\nimplementation of the early-warning mechanism and the\r\ncreation of the high council for peace and security in\r\nCentral Africa are perfect examples of this.\r\nIt is also worth mentioning the joint military\r\nexercises to be held by the member States of the\r\nCommittee in Gabon during the first half of the year 2000\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nto simulate peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, in\r\npreparation for the military exercises that will be held in\r\nGabon within the framework of strengthening African\r\npeacekeeping capabilities, a military-diplomatic seminar\r\ntook place in Libreville in June 1999, with the participation\r\nof 51 countries and international organizations.\r\nIn the last few weeks, the Security Council has held\r\npublic debates on such vital topics as children and civilians\r\nin armed conflicts. And five days ago, I had the honour of\r\nparticipating in another public debate of the Security\r\nCouncil on small weapons. This matter is part of the United\r\nNations efforts to work towards complete disarmament.\r\nIndeed, the illegal circulation of massive quantities of light\r\nand small-calibre weapons in the world hampers\r\ndevelopment and represents a real threat to international\r\npeace and security. The nature of these weapons\r\nunfortunately helps fuel the sad and widely condemned\r\nphenomenon of the use of children as combatants in the\r\nmany conflicts that break out around the world. The same\r\napplies to large-scale banditry.\r\nIn any case, we cannot envision a world at peace if\r\nthe international community does not actively mobilize to\r\nhelp developing countries emerge from the vicious circle of\r\nunderdevelopment-violence-underdevelopment. If luck has\r\nheretofore spared us from the horrors of war, Gabon is not\r\nimmune to the backlash of the armed conflicts that plague\r\nsome of our neighbours. As Security Council resolution\r\n1208 (1998) clearly indicates, asylum countries pay a heavy\r\nprice for their solidarity with people driven out of their\r\nhomes as a result of combat. The consequences of refugee\r\nflows on the security, environment and economies of host\r\ncountries are sometimes incalculable, especially when the\r\npresence of combatants among the refugees is used as an\r\nexcuse for troops to carry out raids in the host country.\r\nEven though we live in peace and have never\r\nexperienced a domestic or inter-State war, Gabon\r\nnevertheless shoulders its share of the burdens of war. We\r\nare facing massive migratory flows that are leading to\r\nserious internal upheavals, and we recently welcomed some\r\n50,000 refugees.\r\nGiven the extent of the situation, for which my\r\ncountry was not prepared, the President of the Republic of\r\nGabon organized on 11 August last a mini-summit in\r\nLibreville with the participation of a number of his peers\r\nfrom the subregion. That summit considered the possibility\r\nof Africans\u0027 taking greater control of the question of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons, with the support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nOn that occasion, President Bongo proposed the\r\ncreation of an African agency for emergency humanitarian\r\nintervention. I would urgently appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to provide greater assistance to African\r\nrefugees. We strongly hope that an emergency programme\r\ncan be set up that would relieve their suffering and\r\nfacilitate their return to their country of origin. The\r\ninternational community has the means to do so, as it has\r\nproved in other situations.\r\nI would like to take advantage of this opportunity to\r\npay warm tribute to Mrs. Sadako Ogata, United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, who, during the\r\ninternational action taken in favour of Kosovo, heightened\r\nthe international community\u0027s awareness of the particular\r\nsituation of African refugees.\r\nLet me now tackle the question of development from\r\nthe perspective of my country\u0027s experience. As in other\r\nAfrican countries, the socio-economic situation of Gabon\r\nis precarious. I shall not then resort to clichés such as\r\nsaying that my country is an “African emirate” because of\r\nour potential in raw materials, to the extent that today we\r\nare the only sub-Saharan nation to be classified by\r\ninternational financial and monetary institutions as an\r\nupper-middle-income country. As a result, we are denied\r\naccess to flexible conditions for our loans and for our\r\ndebt service.\r\nHowever, the Human Development Index, which\r\nplaces us in 124th place, clearly shows that Gabon is in\r\na very similar situation to that of other African countries.\r\nThat is why we have undertaken all of the necessary\r\nstructural reforms to join the global economy and to\r\nparticipate in subregional and regional integration. We\r\nhave liberalized our economy by lifting tariff and non-\r\ntariff barriers and restrictions as well as by instituting\r\ncustoms and tax reform. We have privatized our principal\r\nsemi-public corporations in order to make them more\r\neffective and competitive. We have created a new\r\njuridical and institutional environment that is stable and\r\nwill encourage investment and promote the expansion of\r\nthe private sector. Finally, we have set up effective\r\nprovisions for cooperation and regional integration in the\r\nframework of the Economic and Monetary Community of\r\nCentral Africa and of the Economic Community of\r\nCentral African States.\r\nThe stage has been set, but the actors — meaning\r\nthe investors — have not yet made their entrance. Foreign\r\ndirect investment has thus far systematically avoided our\r\ncontinent.\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nWe feel, however, that the world economy stands to\r\ngain by taking advantage of the immense potential of the\r\nAfrican market, which will soon have a billion consumers\r\nin a continent that is overflowing with oil, gold, diamonds\r\nand other raw materials required by industries of the North.\r\nMy country\u0027s leadership is dedicated to the promotion\r\nof democracy and the institutions that guarantee it— hence\r\nall of the political changes we have experienced and are\r\nexperiencing, which have made Gabon an example of a\r\nsmooth transition from a single-party regime to political\r\npluralism.\r\nIt is against this backdrop that recently, in the\r\npresence of international observers and for the second time\r\nsince the advent of political pluralism, free and fair\r\npresidential elections were held in my country. The\r\nPresident of the Republic, El Hadj Omar Bongo, was re-\r\nelected in a peaceful social and political context, a\r\nguarantee of democratic legitimacy.\r\nDemocracy which is accompanied by good\r\ngovernance, the rule of law and respect for human rights is\r\nthe most important factor in the transition towards a culture\r\nof peace. For lasting peace is a prerequisite for the exercise\r\nof all the rights and obligations of peoples, and it is the\r\nonly soil in which democracy and development can take\r\nroot.\r\nIt is therefore up to the United Nations system and its\r\nMember States to ensure that these goals and principles, so\r\ndear to us, become a reality for all in the new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now give\r\nthe floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tourism and\r\nInformation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Allan Cruickshank.\r\nMr. Cruickshank (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines):\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab on his election to the presidency of this session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I am confident that his vision and\r\nenergy will guide this session to a successful conclusion.\r\nI also thank Mr. Didier Opertti, who led the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly with remarkable\r\ndistinction and efficiency. I commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the\r\nesteemed Secretary-General of this Organization, of whom\r\nthe people of the Caribbean are particularly proud for his\r\nvision and managerial skills as he heads the United Nations,\r\nin precarious financial circumstances, responding to\r\nincreased demands with diminishing resources. I wish to\r\nassure the Secretary-General of the continued support and\r\ncooperation of the Government of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines.\r\nI join previous speakers in welcoming the Republic\r\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga as new Members of the United Nations family.\r\nTheir membership strengthens the universal character of\r\nour Organization.\r\nI extend condolences to the families of the victims\r\nof the earthquakes in Turkey, Greece and, more recently,\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan. I reiterate the\r\nsentiments of sympathy already transmitted to the\r\nGovernment and people of the Bahamas, a sister country\r\nin the Caribbean Community, and to the United States of\r\nAmerica in relation to the devastation wrought by\r\nHurricane Floyd.\r\nThe fifty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations, coming at the end of a century that has\r\nseen war and destruction on the one hand and\r\nunprecedented developments in science and technology on\r\nthe other, provides a timely opportunity to reflect on the\r\nOrganization\u0027s achievements, assess its continued\r\nrelevance in a radically changed environment and chart an\r\nappropriate course of action for the future. Many\r\npowerful forces believe that the United Nations has\r\nperhaps outlived its usefulness and exists now only as the\r\nworld\u0027s most expensive debating club. Ministers of\r\nFinance are presently convened in Washington, D.C., at\r\nthe annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund\r\nand the World Bank Group. There, too, the opinion can\r\nno doubt be heard that circumstances have now overtaken\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nThe big and powerful nations of the world can\r\nafford to argue thus, but for small, vulnerable, developing\r\ncountries such as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, these\r\ninstitutions are important buffers in the interplay between\r\nfinance and politics in the international arena. The\r\noperating budgets of many transnational corporations are\r\nfar greater than the national budgets of developing\r\ncountries such as mine, and we are painfully aware that\r\nthe international development agenda is controlled by\r\nthese corporations.\r\nDespite the technological advances of the last decade\r\nand the tremendous increase in worldwide commerce, the\r\nbenefits of globalization have not been evenly distributed\r\nand it is abundantly clear that developing countries\r\ncontinue to be marginalized. While we acknowledge and\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nrespect the general thrust towards open markets,\r\ncompetition and free trade, I must reiterate my country\u0027s\r\nposition regarding our vital trade in bananas. Even as we\r\nmove to diversify, improve quality and pursue alternative\r\nstrategies and options for development in tourism, financial\r\nservices and informatics, our economic survival and social\r\nstability remain closely linked to the banana trade and the\r\nincome it provides for our farmers. Indeed, there is a strong\r\nand persistent correlation between the rate of economic\r\ngrowth and the performance of the industry. This is further\r\nillustrated by the following facts: in Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, the contribution of the banana industry to direct\r\nemployment is 40 per cent; in the Windward Islands as a\r\nwhole, banana export earnings account for over 50 per cent\r\nof the gross domestic product; and windward Islands\r\nexports account for only 1 per cent of the world trade in\r\nbananas.\r\nThe imminent collapse of our major banana market\r\ndemonstrates just how powerless small developing States\r\ncontinue to be against powerful countries and mega-\r\ncorporations. The disregard for our interests and, indeed,\r\nour survival, by the United States of America, which does\r\nnot export a single hand of bananas, is truly inexplicable.\r\nThe inevitable consequences of this stance will be economic\r\nand social dislocation, manifested in increased\r\nunemployment, impoverishment for our farmers, crime and\r\nthe erosion of basic human rights and dignity.\r\nThe iniquitous and restrictive immigration policies of\r\ncertain developed countries have served only to exacerbate\r\nthe social disintegration of our societies, which are already\r\nunder severe stress.\r\nIf small developing economies are to be able to attract\r\ninvestment, expand production, improve product quality and\r\nmeet standards — in short, compete effectively and grasp\r\nthe opportunities presented in the World Trade Organization\r\nagreements — it is imperative that recognition should be\r\ngiven to their need for support and for adequate transitional\r\nperiods to fully liberalized world trade, which should apply\r\nalso to the banana trade.\r\nAs a corollary to our overall economic development\r\nstrategy, the Government of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines continues to explore, with the assistance of\r\nfriendly nations, options for enhanced airport development\r\non mainland Saint Vincent. The requirements for\r\nagricultural and economic diversification make this\r\nendeavour even more urgent.\r\nWe are exceptionally grateful to the European Union\r\nfor the support which it is continuing to give to ensure\r\nour survival, even in the face of threats to its own\r\neconomic prosperity. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is\r\ninvolved, with other members of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM), in a fundamental process of\r\ndeepening regional integration through the establishment\r\nof a single market and economy by 2001. We are taking\r\nimportant steps to facilitate the free movement of goods,\r\nservices, capital and people in the countries of the\r\nCommunity. We are doing this at a time when the\r\nmomentum of trade liberalization and economic\r\nglobalization has never been greater.\r\nThe region is also committed to the establishment of\r\nthe Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2004.\r\nCARICOM has established regional negotiating\r\nmachinery to coordinate the region\u0027s participation in\r\nexternal trade negotiations, including the Seattle Round of\r\nmultinational trade negotiations.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is resolute in its\r\nopposition to the international trade in drugs. To this end,\r\nmy Government is moving bilaterally and with member\r\ncountries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States\r\nand CARICOM, to establish agreements with third\r\ncountries on mutual assistance in criminal matters. The\r\nGovernment of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nrecognizing its own limitations in confronting the\r\nenormous power and resources of drug traffickers, has\r\nsigned a “ship rider” agreement that gives authority to\r\npursue such criminals in the territorial waters of our\r\narchipelagic State.\r\nGovernments in the small developing countries of\r\nthe Caribbean pay a high political price for cooperating\r\nwith the developed countries in the fight against drugs.\r\nThere were loud protests from certain sections of the\r\npopulation against the Government when the security\r\nforces of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, in\r\ncollaboration with the Regional Security Service and\r\ncontingents from other friendly countries, launched an\r\neradication campaign in our mountainous interior: they\r\nquestioned the Government\u0027s cooperation at a time when\r\naccess for bananas and other products from the Caribbean\r\nto the European market was being challenged.\r\nMy Government will continue to honour its\r\ncommitments under all international agreements to which\r\nwe are signatory. We have enacted appropriate stringent\r\nmeasures in our financial regulations to ensure that\r\nproceeds from the illicit drug trade are not laundered in\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nour financial system. The efforts of economically vulnerable\r\ncountries such as ours in combatting the scourge of drugs\r\nmust be recognized and supported by the international\r\ncommunity in general, and by traditionally friendly\r\ncountries in particular.\r\nOur countries do not wish to be forced out of the\r\nworld trade in legitimate products, causing our peoples to\r\nturn in desperation to trafficking in illegal products. In\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines and in other countries\r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), we\r\nbelieve in stability based on a solid foundation of\r\ndemocracy, respect for human rights and the creation of\r\neconomic and other opportunities for the development of\r\nour peoples. CARICOM has built an outstanding record in\r\nthis regard. The recent mission to Haiti headed by our own\r\nPrime Minister, The Right Honourable Sir James Mitchell,\r\nto examine that country\u0027s readiness to conduct general\r\nelections, is another example of CARICOM\u0027s commitment\r\nto those principles.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines places very high\r\npriority on education, training and human-resource\r\ndevelopment. These are a very important part of the\r\ndeclaration of principles adopted by the leaders of the 34\r\ncountries of the western hemisphere at the second Summit\r\nof the Americas, held at Santiago, Chile, in 1998.\r\nI take this opportunity to reiterate the gratitude of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines to the Government and the people of Cuba,\r\nwhich despite their difficult economic circumstances,\r\ncaused by the continuing trade embargo against that\r\nCaribbean country, have offered numerous scholarships to\r\nthe young people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines places great value on this\r\nunmistakable act of friendship and assistance.\r\nSmall island developing States such as Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines attach great importance to such issues\r\nas the integrity of our coastal and marine resources, solid-\r\nwaste management and natural-disaster preparedness,\r\nbecause we are conscious of the negative repercussions that\r\ncan result if effective measures are not put in place. We run\r\nthe risk of damaging our fragile ecosystems to the\r\ndetriment of development and tourism, and moreover\r\ncompromising their sustainable use and enjoyment by future\r\ngenerations. It is for that reason that CARICOM condemns\r\nin the strongest terms the shipment of hazardous material\r\nthrough the territorial waters of the Caribbean countries.\r\nWithout the benefit of scientific proof of the origins and\r\nreasons for the recent fish kill in our waters, there is cause\r\nfor serious concern; investigation in this regard is\r\nongoing. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the\r\nconcerns expressed by other small island developing\r\nStates and strongly supports the adoption of a draft\r\nresolution on small island developing States recognizing\r\nthe Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe vulnerability of small States has been made\r\nmore acute because of lack of capacity, declining aid\r\nflows, graduation from concessionary financing, the\r\ndisappearance of trade preferences, and a lack of\r\ncompetitiveness. The implementation of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States is therefore imperative for\r\nour survival.\r\nMy delegation fully supports the efforts of the\r\ninternational community in addressing the conflicts in\r\nKosovo and in East Timor. We look forward to lasting\r\npeace and stability in those areas.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines also applauds the\r\nefforts and commitment of Prime Minister Barak of Israel\r\nand Chairman Arafat of the Palestine Liberation\r\nOrganization to bring peace and security to the people of\r\ntheir region.\r\nA draft resolution on the readmission to this body of\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan was once again\r\ndefeated. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however,\r\nstrongly supports the aspiration of those 21 million people\r\nto exercise their right to share and participate in the\r\nactivities of this community of nations.\r\nMy country has consistently expressed its views in\r\nrelation to reform of the United Nations in general and of\r\nthe Security Council in particular. I will not revisit them\r\nnow, but I wish to reiterate that Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines strongly favours reform of the United Nations\r\nto give more equitable consideration to the concerns of\r\nthe majority of countries comprising the General\r\nAssembly. Let us remodel it along more democratic lines\r\nto address the realities of the world today.\r\nAs we approach the new millennium, my delegation\r\nwould like to urge all Member States to demonstrate their\r\nunwavering support for the goals and ideals enshrined in\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations: peace, security, human\r\nrights, fundamental freedoms, international cooperation,\r\nand development for all mankind.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call next\r\non the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, His Excellency Mr. Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombasi.\r\nMr. Ndombasi (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\r\n(spoke in French): The convening in the splendid\r\nmetropolis of New York of this last General Assembly\r\nsession of the millennium affords me the happy\r\nopportunity, on behalf of the people, the Government of\r\nPublic Salvation and the head of State, His Excellency\r\nPresident Laurent-Désiré Kabila, of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, to convey our warmest greetings to\r\nall people the world over who love peace and justice.\r\nIt is my pleasant duty also to congratulate the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the other Assembly\r\nofficers on their unanimous election to the leadership of the\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. My country views the\r\nelection to the presidency of Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab as\r\nrecognition of his many sterling qualities, both human and\r\nprofessional, and as an acknowledgement by the\r\ninternational community of the important role played by his\r\ncountry, Namibia, in building an Africa and a world that\r\nwill be marked by peace, political stability and economic\r\nprosperity. The President may be sure that the delegation of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo will unreservedly\r\nsupport him in fulfilling his mandate and in guiding the\r\nwork of the Assembly to a successful conclusion.\r\nI also extend to his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti,\r\nour full appreciation of the extremely important work he\r\ndid during his presidency, as well as the commitment he\r\nshowed throughout to the triumph of the ideals embodied\r\nin the United Nations Charter.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to welcome here in\r\nour world Organization three new Members: the Republic\r\nof Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga.\r\nI invite Members to read my prepared text at their\r\nleisure, so that I may say a few other things. I begin with\r\na good quotation, from Article 2 of the United Nations\r\nCharter:\r\n“The Organization and its Members, in pursuit of\r\nthe Purposes stated in Article 1, shall act in\r\naccordance with the following Principles.\r\n“1. The Organization is based on the principle\r\nof the sovereign equality of all its Members.\r\n“2. All Members, in order to ensure to all of\r\nthem the rights and benefits resulting from\r\nmembership, shall fulfil in good faith the obligations\r\nassumed by them in accordance with the present\r\nCharter.\r\n“3. All Members shall settle their international\r\ndisputes by peaceful means in such a manner that\r\ninternational peach and security, and justice, are not\r\nendangered.\r\n“4. All Members shall refrain in their\r\ninternational relations from the threat or use of force\r\nagainst the territorial integrity or political\r\nindependence of any state, or in any other manner\r\ninconsistent with the Purposes of the United\r\nNations”.\r\nI say to representatives: This is the United Nations\r\nCharter, your Charter. Are there represented in this Hall\r\n— yes or no — Members that violate these principles\r\ngoverning relations between nations? Are there\r\nrepresented in this Hall — yes or no — Members that do\r\nworse than those that do not pay their dues, or pay them\r\nlate, regarding which immediate reminders are sent, and\r\nrightly so, since the rules of procedure of the\r\nOrganization of which they are Members prescribe that\r\nfor its proper functioning each Member must pay its\r\ndues? Failing to do so even means being stripped of the\r\nright to speak here at the United Nations. So, if you have\r\nyour right to speak taken away, if you are punished as a\r\nMember of the United Nations because you do not pay\r\nyour dues, what about those who violate Article 2 of the\r\nCharter, who cross the boundaries of another State with\r\ntheir armies, sow hardship in that country, occupy vast\r\nportions of its territory, plunder its natural resources, steal\r\nthe fauna and rare species of animals which international\r\norganizations recognize as being received by other\r\ncountries, carry out a blitzkrieg such as the one in the\r\nearly 1940s, without warning, without provocation,\r\nentering the country of another people with their arms and\r\neverything else they need, under pretexts which I shall\r\nexpose in a little while.\r\nOn 2 August 1998, some two years ago, our brothers\r\nfrom the hills of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda invaded\r\nour country in an unprovoked blitzkrieg, without having\r\ndeclared war, and it continues to this very day. For two\r\nyears now those Members of the United Nations have\r\nbeen violating Article 2, and they continue to violate it,\r\nwith arrogance and total impunity, which is not the case\r\nfor those who fail to pay their dues.\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nIt is perhaps better to violate Article 2, occupy other\r\ncountries, pillage them, deport their inhabitants and torture\r\nchildren, women and old persons, than it is to commit the\r\nmortal sin of failing to pay up. There are two yardsticks,\r\ndouble standards, which we regard as an immense injustice.\r\nAs I speak I feel the presence of illustrious persons\r\nwho have spoken from this rostrum in the past, such as\r\nCabral, Nkrumah and — I say this with a great deal of\r\nemotion — Lumumba, who came here to denounce what\r\nwas being set in train more than 30 years ago, under United\r\nNations banners which is now being repeated. We know the\r\nUnited Nations. The French rightly say “A cat that has been\r\nscalded is even afraid of cold water.” They have already\r\ncome, those United Nations forces; they came to restore\r\npeace, and the result was that for one of the most illustrious\r\nsons of our people, the most admired African nationalist\r\nPresident Patrice Lumumba, the flag of the United Nations\r\nserved as a shroud. We do not wish, we will not allow, that\r\nsame flag to be a shroud for those who have taken up the\r\ntorch that fell from Lumumba\u0027s hands and who carried it,\r\nwith some help of course, as far as lying down — with\r\ntheir boots on — in Mobutu\u0027s bed. This is something with\r\nwhich the Assembly is familiar.\r\nIt is on behalf of my President, my friend, my long-\r\ntime comrade, that I speak. As representatives will see, and\r\nas I often say, we will have no more charming “Rastas”,\r\nbecause we lost our hair waiting for President Kabila to\r\nreturn to relight the torch that fell from Lumumba\u0027s hands.\r\nIf people do not watch out, if they let things slide\r\nalong, if they tolerate arrogance and do not stand up to\r\nimpunity, there are those who will begin to dream of\r\nwrapping Kabila up in the United Nations flag, as was done\r\nin the case of Patrice Lumumba not long ago.\r\nWhen events are repeated, they do not always happen\r\nin exactly the same way, but sometimes the repetition\r\nstrikes a familiar chord. Now we see the United Nations\r\ndelaying putting an end to what it calls euphemistically the\r\n“conflict” in the Great Lakes region. This terminology is\r\nbeing used for some reason — but what? A foreign army\r\ncrosses the border, occupies the country, a part of the\r\ncountry; it pillages the country\u0027s wealth — and the United\r\nNations calls this a “conflict”? We should check our\r\ndictionaries. This is a war. Instead of shouting themselves\r\nhoarse about sending peacekeepers, Member States must\r\nsend people who can put an end to the war. This is what I\r\nam waiting for. Our Rwandan, Ugandan and Burundi\r\nbrothers must be solemnly requested here and now to go\r\nback home. They have no business being in our country.\r\nThey are undermining all national reconstruction efforts.\r\nThis should be clear to those who understand the\r\ncondition in which we found this country, which used to\r\nbe called Zaire and which we now call, as Lumumba\r\ncalled it, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe presence of these outsiders, their occupation,\r\nimpedes our efforts to reconstruct our country. They came\r\nupon us like thieves who attack without warning. They\r\nattacked while we were busy sowing corn, peanuts and\r\nbeans, and we were doing so because that was what we\r\nwas needed in this country that is overflowing with\r\ndiamonds, gold, cobalt, copper and so forth. In order to\r\nhelp our people we had begun by planting peanuts, corn\r\nand beans, but our efforts were stopped cold by these\r\npeople who are now in our territory, who came from the\r\nhills, who came to defend their borders — their borders\r\nthat, according to them, were threatened by genocidal\r\nbands in our country.\r\nI ask the Assembly to look at a map of Africa, a\r\nmap of the Congo in particular. I come from the Atlantic\r\nCoast province of Bas-Congo. Do you know where these\r\npeople who began the war came from, in order to secure\r\ntheir borders? They came from 2,000 kilometres away\r\nfrom my province. They began in my province in order\r\nto secure borders 2,000 kilometres away. They brought\r\nsoldiers 2,000 kilometres from their borders in order to\r\nbegin the occupation of our country. Luckily, they took a\r\nlicking, and they would all have been wiped out if the\r\nAmericans had not asked us to allow them to return home\r\nalong a designated route. They retreated after their\r\nthrashing and tried their luck in the east of our country.\r\nAfter the ceasefire requested by Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, United Nations staff went to the area to\r\ncarry out an order of the World Health Organization to\r\nvaccinate all children up to five years of age. We have\r\nvaccinated them in the part of the country that we\r\ncontinue to control. But these others — who only have\r\ntwo hands, both of which are busy pillaging — have yet\r\nto vaccinate the children in this age group. Thus, these\r\nchildren are in danger not only of polio, but also of other\r\ndiseases that the agencies of our Organization have been\r\nstriving to eliminate from our continent.\r\nThese soldiers do not have time to vaccinate our\r\nchildren. They do not even have time to pillage\r\neffectively because these Horatii and Curiatii have taken\r\nto fighting each other on our soil. They came to take\r\ncontrol of our country, but now, how strange, they are\r\nfighting each other, these people who came to teach us\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\ndemocracy, these people who came to restore peace. In\r\norder to have a break from their looting, they are enjoying\r\na little war on our land, and in the process destroying the\r\n3 million doses of vaccine that the United Nations, through\r\nthe World Health Organization, sent to Kisangani. They\r\nshoot at each other, each band allied with this or that local.\r\nThis is what is happening.\r\nAnd then these people take their place here as United\r\nNations Members — after having treated us like that, and\r\nas they continue to do so. They are building up their\r\narsenals, bringing in troops, taking towns. What reassures\r\nus is the teaching of the Marquis de Sade that taking is not\r\nthe same as possessing. Thus, these people are taking towns\r\nbut they do not possess them. And they will not posses\r\nthem because, just as in erotic relations, there is no\r\npossession without consent — that consent that has been\r\ngiven to us. Otherwise, our people would not have fled to\r\nthe forests to escape from these people who come from the\r\nhills. Our citizens\u0027 lengthy stay in the forests has led to the\r\nreappearance of some diseases that were eradicated as long\r\nago as the Belgian colonial era.\r\nHaving to flee the invaders like the plague makes our\r\ncitizens\u0027 lives more difficult. And these people from the\r\nhills continue to advance even though they signed with us,\r\nlast 10 July, a Ceasefire Agreement that lacks both fire and\r\na cease, as they continue to advance and lay siege to our\r\ncities.\r\nTheir latest exploit, which they are now engaged in, is\r\nto lay siege to the city of Mbuji-Mayi, the world diamond\r\ncapital, but also the world capital of children afflicted with\r\npolio. I do not think that their haste and willingness to\r\nreturn to Mbuji-Mayi are out of desire to vaccinate the poor\r\nCongolese children who are infected with or at risk of\r\ngetting polio. These people from the hills do not have a\r\nthird hand, as I said earlier, yet I am sure that, driven by\r\ntheir greed, they are going to take as many diamonds and\r\nas much copper and cobalt as they can — and at the risk of\r\nfighting each other for these minerals, since Uganda also\r\nwants to take them. The statistics on sales of diamonds\r\nindicate that last month our Rwandan brothers sold more\r\nthan a million carats of diamonds — a mineral not mined\r\nin their country — and with the money from the sales they\r\nare buying weapons so as to be able to fight us. Then they\r\ntake more diamonds, buy more weapons and continue to\r\nfight us.\r\nIn this Hall speeches have been made against dirty\r\nmoney. Therefore, we are outraged to see bloodstained\r\ncobalt, bloodstained copper, bloodstained gold and\r\nbloodstained diamonds for sale on the international\r\nmarket, and to see that it does not occur to the buyers of\r\nthis booty to put a stop to this practice by refusing to buy\r\nit — even though they oppose dirty money. Double\r\nstandards continue to prevail.\r\nDirty money poses a threat to the world. And yet,\r\nwhile the blood of the Congolese people is spattered on\r\nour cobalt, our copper and our gold, that doesn\u0027t seem to\r\nbother those from all over the world who buy them and\r\ngive money to the pillagers and occupiers our country. If\r\nwe revisit this issue, I reserve the right to address it\r\nagain.\r\nI wish, however, to speak out loud and clear against\r\nthe infamous pretext that has aroused the world\u0027s\r\nprurience and sensitivity about genocide. Those who are\r\nguilty of genocide are in our country right now. Let them\r\nleave and go on sowing misery in their own countries:\r\nRwanda, Uganda or Burundi.\r\nAs I said at the outset, President Kabila has raised\r\nLumumba\u0027s torch and welcomed those who sought refuge\r\nin our country, because over there you do not seek\r\nrefuge — you get your throat slit. I was just a schoolboy\r\nwhen I saw Hutus fleeing cutthroat Tutsi and Tutsi\r\nfleeing cutthroat Hutus. They all sought refuge with us.\r\nThat is how those who helped us, who walked with us on\r\nour march on Kinshasa, came to be refugees in our\r\ncountry — they fled Hutus who would have cut their\r\nthroats. That is at the heart of the current instability and\r\nreflects the values of our brothers in Rwanda. We must\r\nhelp our Rwandese to change their political culture.\r\nWhen the “one man one vote” law was enacted in\r\n1960, the obsession of each of these groups was to seize\r\npower and abuse it in order to hasten the carnage. This\r\ncarnage has been alternating and reciprocal and did not\r\nbegin in 1994. I cited a date when I was in short pants,\r\nand I can assure the Assembly that it was not yesterday.\r\nIt is the open faucet that produced the interahamwe that\r\nwe must close. Rwanda must become democratic;\r\nRwanda must adopt a culture of politics and abandon its\r\nculture of carnage. Rwanda must leave our country;\r\nUganda must leave our country; Burundi must leave our\r\ncountry and turn over the task of providing security to\r\nUnited Nations observers, who will take their place and\r\nserve as a buffer force between us. Those people are our\r\nneighbours and we can never replace our neighbours, but\r\nthey are on our territory, which means they are no longer\r\nour neighbours. I ask the Assembly to help us to resume\r\nour status as neighbours. Let them go back home and if\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nthere are problems that we must settle among ourselves, we\r\nshall settle them by peaceful means.\r\nI am speaking without acrimony. We hold out our\r\nhands to our brothers from Rwanda, who have been here\r\nfor several days. I offer them signals of friendship when we\r\npass, and they respond. We are here so that in three\r\nmonths, when the new millennium dawns, we will not still\r\nbe fighting. One must deal with urgent matters quickly.\r\nThe Lusaka process, in which I participated, raised\r\nhopes that have been dashed by dilatory tactics. One\r\nmoment the Congolese and Rwandese affiliates who refuse\r\nto come; the next, it is the Ugandans or their Congolese\r\npuppets. Here we are on 29 September and nothing has yet\r\nbeen done seriously to implement an Agreement that was\r\nreached on 10 July.\r\nThat is why we ask the Assembly, if only out of\r\nrespect for the Articles of the Charter, to do something\r\nabout it. It is intolerable and incomprehensible that these\r\npeople remain, and may even take the floor here, while\r\nthey continue to violate the United Nations Charter and the\r\nprinciples that bring us together here. If you violate the\r\nprinciples of an organization to which you belong, you are\r\nno longer worthy of belonging.\r\nWe must remind our brothers that, as Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, they are bound to respect the Charter. This\r\ncannot be done by occupying other people\u0027s countries. If\r\ndifferences must be settled by invasion and plunder, there\r\nwill no longer be a United Nations, because there will no\r\nlonger be any rules to unite us. That prompts my request to\r\nthe Assembly, because the suffering being endured by the\r\nCongolese people and the atrocities being visited upon us\r\nare unimaginable.\r\nUnder the very nose of the Vatican, in the Italian\r\nmission of Kasika, these new-style Huns entered, tore open\r\nthe chest of a traditional chief, pulled out his heart,\r\nshredded it and distributed the pieces like hosts. The killers\r\nwho did this sucked on the bloody heart as if it were an\r\nice-cream cone. We have seen this and continue to witness\r\nsuch acts. Our United Nations mission is at Members\u0027\r\ndisposal to provide irrefutable testimony, which we have\r\npublished in a three-volume white paper that could easily\r\ngrow into further volumes describing similar incidents. We\r\nhave requested that this white paper be issued as a working\r\ndocument of the Security Council. All are invited to study\r\nit in order to understand precisely what is happening and to\r\nput an end to this situation — to save the United Nations\r\nitself, to help us Africans, and the Congolese in particular,\r\nwho had to wait 32 years to defeat and eliminate a regime\r\nof notorious satraps, only to see new satraps step in two\r\nmonths later to occupy our country and put it to the\r\nsword.\r\nHelp us to make our Rwandese, Ugandan and\r\nBurundian brothers understand that they must go home.\r\nThey have no business in our country; let them relinquish\r\ntheir place to United Nations forces, which will secure\r\ntheir borders. That is in itself a fiction that we have not\r\nhad an opportunity to dwell on. They helped us to raise\r\nLumumba\u0027s torch. They were in our army. Most officers\r\nin our army were from Rwanda, as was the Chief of\r\nStaff, who dispatched his troops on the basis of his\r\nparticular military skills. Moreover, these people have\r\noccupied that region of our country for two years and are\r\nstill hunting the Interahamwe, as the Incas were once\r\nhunted here. They will not stop until Joe the Ugandan and\r\nBill the Rwandese have extended their hunting grounds to\r\nthe entire territory of our country while they prance after\r\nthe Interahamwe.\r\nThis is just a pretext. If they were not able to catch\r\na single Interahamwe while their officers were in our\r\narmy; if they have been unable to stop the interahamwe\r\nin their two-year occupation of that region, then the task\r\nis beyond them. It must be left to the United Nations to\r\nunseat these Interahamwe, if they exist, and let us pursue\r\nour national reconstruction.\r\nI have a great deal more to say and believe that we\r\nwill have further opportunities in due course.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call on\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nLithuania, His Excellency Mr. Algirdas Saudargas.\r\nMr. Saudargas (Lithuania): It is a special pleasure\r\nfor me to see Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab guiding the General\r\nAssembly this session over the junction of two centuries\r\nand millenniums. We will lend all possible support to his\r\nendeavours, including through the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Lithuania, who is also one of his Vice-\r\nChairmen.\r\nAnother landmark of this session is the fact that we\r\nhave grown. We welcome the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to this\r\nhouse of nations where all, large or small, are equal. We\r\nare glad to see nations from the Pacific enrich the\r\norganization. On behalf of the Lithuanian Government I\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\npay our deep respects to the Secretary-General, who has\r\nalways been a brilliant servant of peace around the globe.\r\nSpeakers before me have referred to the symbolic\r\nmeaning of this session of the General Assembly. It may be\r\njust a simple turn of our calendar pages or we can make it\r\na stepping-stone to a better world with less violence, more\r\nfood for the hungry, less deliberately caused suffering and\r\ndeath, more care for the helpless and more shelter for the\r\nhomeless.\r\nThis century has taught us many lessons. Yet, even if\r\nwe have avoided another world war, we have witnessed too\r\nmany wars. The nature of crises has changed. Member\r\nStates should be able to find common ground in upholding\r\nthe principles of the Charter and acting in defence of\r\nhumanity. We should devise ways and means to prevent\r\nhumanitarian catastrophes and alleviate profound human\r\nsuffering. Just this last year, Angola and Kosovo, Sierra\r\nLeone and East Timor have posed new challenges to the\r\nUnited Nations and made us re-evaluate our actions in\r\nconflict prevention; the role of the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil and its interactions with regional organizations; the\r\nCouncil\u0027s credibility with regard to speed of deployment;\r\nthe role of civilian police and civilian administration; and\r\nthe problem of impunity. When evidence of the murder of\r\nhelpless people percolates through international borders, the\r\ndilemma emerging before the international community\r\nbecomes a moral one of the sanctity of human life and\r\nstrict international standards.\r\nIt is precisely towards this end that the United Nations\r\nsystem is undergoing changes. A number of administrative\r\nmeasures have been taken, especially those within the\r\npower of the Secretary-General. One of the most urgent\r\nmeasures which must be taken is reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. The Council has too often been accused of failures\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security in the\r\nspecific cases I mentioned.\r\nThe efficiency of the Security Council\u0027s actions can be\r\nenhanced by improving its representativeness, legitimacy\r\nand credibility, thus generating wider acceptance of its\r\ndecisions. This would be possible primarily through an\r\nenlargement of the Council\u0027s membership. The two most\r\nqualified industrialized countries could become permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council: their membership would\r\nstrengthen the Council and ensure democratic decisions. A\r\nbroader representation of developing nations on the Council\r\nwould also reinforce its legitimacy and enhance respect for\r\nit: they deserve additional seats, both permanent and non-\r\npermanent.\r\nIn recent years we have seen the development of the\r\nUnited Nations response away from peacekeeping to more\r\nactive conflict prevention and crises management of\r\ncivilian. Internal crises often lead to the complete\r\ndestruction of societies and their structures: repair and\r\nrehabilitation of collapsed countries by the international\r\ncommunity are needed.\r\nThe United Nations needs both the means and\r\ncooperation from all if it is to fulfil its mandate in terms\r\nof its primary responsibility for maintaining international\r\npeace and security. In this connection, Lithuania signed a\r\nstandby agreement as early as the beginning of 1998 and\r\nprovided a detailed description of its contribution. A\r\nsubstantial part of our contribution is comprised of well-\r\ntrained civilian policemen who are now doing their duty\r\nby serving in Kosovo.\r\nA comprehensive set of political measures will have\r\nto be elaborated before and adopted at the millennium\r\nsummit, which should be a breath of fresh air for the\r\nOrganization. We take this seriously and are ready to\r\nassist in designing a meaningful future for the United\r\nNations.\r\nSituations that deteriorate into conflicts are ignited\r\nby a variety of causes, usually a combination of them.\r\nThe wave of economic crashes that swept through Asia,\r\nLatin America and some European countries has had a\r\nglobal impact. The quick recovery of many economies\r\nshows that democracies with free market economies have\r\nthe strongest immunity against macroeconomic illnesses.\r\nMarkets and democracy allow for the fairest distribution\r\nof resources within societies which would otherwise be\r\nfeeling the pain of economic injustice.\r\nSimilarly, concerns about the potential and actual\r\nviolence which more often occurs within than between\r\nStates are almost always well-founded in places with poor\r\nhuman rights records. No one today is surprised by news\r\nof violence sparked by various rebel groups that feel\r\nmarginalized in the States where they live.\r\nMany instruments must still be designed to uphold\r\nthe principle that those responsible for gross violations of\r\nhuman rights and crimes against humanity — who still\r\nexpect impunity — must be held accountable. The\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court is one\r\nof the fruits of the new developments in international\r\nrelations. We are committed to the early entry into force\r\nof the Rome Statute and to an effective International\r\nCriminal Court.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nWeaponry and armaments can be reduced through\r\ncommon actions, regardless of borders. There is literally a\r\nconsensus among nations that weapons of mass destruction\r\nmust be eliminated, but in reality the process of nuclear\r\ndisarmament is unacceptably precarious. We see reductions\r\nin numbers of warheads in some places and the\r\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons in others. Also, the\r\nbiological and chemical weapons which States have reduced\r\nhave become available to non-State terrorist entities that\r\nfeel almost no qualms about using them. I see no other way\r\nto build a safer world than by reducing, eliminating and\r\nvery strictly prohibiting weapons of mass destruction and\r\nthe means for delivering them.\r\nConventional arms and weapons are also weapons of\r\nmass destruction of life: half a million lives in Rwanda\r\nwere wiped out with clubs and machetes that can only be\r\nconsidered weapons. Lives are lost to firearms and\r\nlandmines all over the world, even in places that can hardly\r\nqualify as battlegrounds. The elimination of landmines is\r\nunder way. Nowhere else but in this Hall can we begin\r\neffective conventional disarmament to be carried out under\r\nthe responsibility of all States.\r\nEurope happens to be blessed with good regional\r\nsecurity instruments, the best of which was nevertheless\r\ninspired by the deaths of millions in senseless wars. The\r\nEuropean security charter, the concepts for which are now\r\nbeing discussed in the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), will further build on the\r\nideals of democracy, peace and unity set out in the Charter\r\nof Paris for a New Europe on the basis of the Helsinki\r\nFinal Act. The implementation of OSCE principles,\r\nincluding a country\u0027s right to choose its own security\r\narrangements, is fundamental to ensuring peace and\r\nsecurity. Finally, regional, subregional and bilateral\r\npractical cooperative efforts do enhance broader European\r\nendeavours and processes, including complementing — not\r\nundercutting — the work of other Euro-Atlantic institutions.\r\nWe believe in collective security and have made\r\nmembership in effective alliances of democratic and peace-\r\nloving nations — the European Union and the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization — our priority. The collective\r\nsecurity that we have chosen is the most efficient means of\r\nmeeting our legitimate needs.\r\nLithuania works actively in the Baltic region to create\r\nsecurity and stability based on cooperation and good-\r\nneighbourly relations. The Baltic Sea region is becoming\r\none of the most stable and dynamic, developing and\r\npromising regions in this part of the world.\r\nNine days ago, Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke\r\nfrom this very podium about a progressing supremacy of\r\ncollective needs over individual needs. In fact, his speech\r\nwas a testimony of brave and modern thought. It deserves\r\na place in textbooks for politicians and diplomats.\r\nConflicts are but one challenge for us. There are so\r\nmany inhabitants on Earth who need our help yet\r\nsometimes cannot even ask for it. Children deserve our\r\nstrongest love, and yet they are helplessly suffering in\r\nmany parts of the world. They do not realize that the\r\nadult world will soon celebrate the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild, which has been ratified or acceded to by 191\r\ncountries — more than the number of United Nations\r\nMember States. It is the most universal human rights\r\ntreaty, the violation of which must be inconceivable and\r\npunishable. The newly adopted Convention on the\r\nElimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour should\r\nalso become universal and support compliance.\r\nThis year will also be the twentieth year since the\r\nadoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). It is\r\nsymbolic and crucial that this Convention has been\r\nstrengthened by the optional protocol. Lithuania supports\r\nthe proposal by Austria, after its adoption by the United\r\nNations General Assembly, to have this new human rights\r\ninstrument opened for signature on 10 December, which\r\nmarks Human Rights Day 1999. States have to give\r\nwomen the chance to address their grievances to the\r\nCEDAW Committee as soon as possible, perhaps even at\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly on “Women\r\n2000: gender, equality, development and peace for the\r\ntwenty-first century” to be held in June in the year 2000.\r\nIdeals advocated by Woodrow Wilson at the\r\nbeginning of this century are celebrating their second\r\nbirth at the very end of the century. I am convinced that\r\nafter many ups and downs, the evolution of humankind is\r\nfinally taking the straight and right course.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the chairman\r\nof the delegation of Antigua and Barbuda, His Excellency\r\nMr. Patrick Albert Lewis.\r\nMr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): Antigua and\r\nBarbuda offers hearty congratulations on the election of\r\nthe president of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. His efforts towards bringing about the\r\nindependence of Namibia are well known, and many of\r\nus remember when he occupied a seat on the right side of\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nthe main section of this Hall, sitting as an observer behind\r\nthe name plate of the South-West Africa People\u0027s\r\nOrganization (SWAPO).\r\nMr. Gurirab\u0027s call for the return to Africa of its\r\nplundered artwork and artifacts struck a chord, as those of\r\nus who studied the African liberation struggles will recall\r\nthat some 25 years ago, when he was a younger individual,\r\nhe pleaded with this body for the return of African icons\r\nwhich adorned European and North American museums and\r\nprivate collections. My country is most supportive of his\r\nplea and would urge that the priceless treasures of artwork,\r\nicons and relics be returned to the continent from which\r\nthey were taken.\r\nMy country also wishes to thank his predecessor,\r\nDidier Opertti, who hails from Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean, for the astute and skilful manner in which he\r\nconducted the affairs of the fifty-third session. Likewise,\r\nmy nation\u0027s sentiments go out to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan, and we wish him continued success in the arduous\r\ntasks of bringing peace, harmony, development and justice\r\nto a global community not yet united into a true family of\r\nnations.\r\nA warm welcome is simultaneously extended to the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga on becoming full-fledged members of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nTo the people of our sister Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) State of the Bahamas, we extend our profound\r\nsympathy in the wake of the devastation wrought by\r\nHurricane Floyd upon the islands of Abaco, Eleuthera, San\r\nSalvador and Cat Island, as well as other parts of the\r\ncountry. We thank donor countries and international\r\ninstitutions for the assistance given in the past, and we hope\r\nthat there will be a speedy response to the needs of the\r\nBahamian community at this time.\r\nIn this regard, special mention has to be made of\r\nKuwait for the manner in which it follows up on assisting\r\nsmall Caribbean countries in times of peril, and we urge the\r\ninternational community to work towards the preservation\r\nof that country and the maintenance of the dignity of its\r\npeople.\r\nIt was with delight and glee that I read the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s descriptive definition of globalization, as it took\r\nin some of the considerations that my country has brought\r\nbefore this body over the past three years. He stated,\r\n“Globalization is a summary term for the\r\nincreasingly complex interactions between\r\nindividuals, enterprises, institutions and markets\r\nacross national borders. The manifold challenges it\r\nposes, challenges that cannot successfully be\r\naddressed by nation States acting on their own,\r\nprovide the most immediate and obvious reason for\r\nstrengthening multilateral cooperation. Globalization\r\nis manifest in the growth in trade, technology and\r\nfinancial flows; in the continuing growth and\r\nincreasing influence of international civil society\r\nactors; in the global operations of transnational\r\ncorporations; in the vast increase in transboundary\r\ncommunication and information exchanges, most\r\nnotably via the Internet; in transboundary\r\ntransmission of disease and ecological impact; and\r\nin the increased internationalization of certain types\r\nof criminal activity. Its benefits and risks are\r\ndistributed unequally, and the growth and prosperity\r\nit provides for many is offset by the increasing\r\nvulnerability and marginalization of others — and by\r\nthe growth of \u0027uncivil society\u0027.” (A/54/1, para. 220)\r\nClearly, globalization leads to the reduction of the\r\nsovereignty of States, with the weakest and the smallest\r\nbeing the biggest losers. Sadly lacking in the arguments\r\nfor globalization is the need to give consideration to the\r\npace, direction and content of liberalization due to\r\ndifferent levels of development and the need to build up\r\nnational capabilities. Above all is the insistence on the\r\nprinciple of free trade for the developing world and an\r\nexemption from the same for the industrialized countries.\r\nProtective devices are inbuilt for farmers in the dominant\r\neconomies, which include subsidies, guaranteed markets,\r\npayments not to produce beyond a certain level in order\r\nto maintain price levels and quite often insistence that\r\nimported farm belt products come in by way of limited\r\nmeans of processing and under the most stringent of\r\nguidelines. On the other hand, when former colonial\r\ncountries provide preferences to their previous colonies of\r\nexploitation, challenges are mounted through the World\r\nTrade Organization by multinational enterprises. There is\r\nno more blatant example than Chiquita in regard to the\r\nCaribbean banana producers.\r\nThe sad thing is that there is clear knowledge that in\r\nmodern times there has never been free trade. It is not my\r\nintention to de-glorify Richard Cobden and John Bright,\r\nbut the repeal of the corn laws in nineteenth-century\r\nBritain had more to do with the failure of the potato crops\r\nin Britain and Ireland, strikes by workmen against wage\r\nreductions and an alliance of industrial and commercial\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\ninterests against the landed gentry than it had to do with\r\nfree trade. Yet irrespective of the fallacy of this free trade\r\nargument, recipients of benefits under the Lomé Convention\r\nare literally being told that they, but not the dominant\r\nPowers, must conform to and operate under the fallacy.\r\nAny disaster to banana production in the Caribbean\r\nwill affect not only the banana-producing countries, but all\r\nof the Caribbean Community. Our countries are striving to\r\nremove themselves from dependence on aid. Glenys\r\nKinnock, a member of the European Parliament, put it\r\nsuccinctly when she stated that the banana trade provided\r\na ladder out of poverty for the Caribbean region and that\r\nthe call for the regime to be dropped and direct aid to be\r\nsubstituted was unrealistic. She went on to state that it was\r\nwrong to claim that attempts to diversify were not taking\r\nplace.\r\nIn CARICOM, we do not wish to become international\r\nmendicants; otherwise the current situation, in which some\r\ndominant countries exercise undue pressure upon our\r\nmodus vivendi, will increase to the point where we will\r\nhave to dance to whichever tune the piper or pipers play.\r\nThe United Nations should be viewed as the foremost\r\ninternational body with a semblance of egalitarianism. It\r\nshould not be viewed as the institution of the dominant\r\ncountries in the five regional groups; and, more than that,\r\nit ought to be the body that stands up to the encroachment\r\nof multinational enterprises that attempt to stifle the lifeline\r\nor lifeblood of legitimate and sovereign countries. If indeed\r\nthe United Nations is the champion of equality, of\r\nsovereignty, of the maintenance of traditional practices\r\nwhich in reality do not harm others, then the collective\r\ncountries should denounce this imposition by a\r\nmultinational entity, which will bring ultimate and profound\r\nhardships upon our humanfolk — be they young men or\r\nold men, children or maidens, matrons or old women. We\r\nhave said it before, and will reiterate that what is being\r\ninflicted upon the Caribbean banana producers is an act of\r\nwar.\r\nThe perils of our States are certainly not limited to\r\nbananas, and Antigua and Barbuda, as well as the majority\r\nof countries represented on the Executive Board the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), were most\r\nsurprised to experience a challenge from a member of the\r\nSecurity Council relating to our first-country cooperation\r\nframework. This was presented, by a country with which\r\nwe have cordial relations, as being a matter of principle, as\r\nAntigua and Barbuda\u0027s per capita income is $8,000 and in\r\n1998 it ranked twenty-ninth in the Human Development\r\nReport. There was absolutely no mention of the fact that\r\nin the vulnerability index, Antigua and Barbuda ranks\r\nextremely high, due in part to the frequency with which\r\nhurricanes batter our twin-island State or threaten our\r\nlovely shores. Consequently, Antigua and Barbuda once\r\nagain had to offer a reminder that its graduation from the\r\nloan windows of international financial institutions and\r\nfrom development assistance of other international\r\nagencies, based only on the narrow criterion of per capita\r\nincome, which ignores the serious and persistent problems\r\nconfronted by Antigua and Barbuda and most Caribbean\r\nsmall island developing States, is both unfair and unjust.\r\nWe also had to point out that 5 per cent of our country\u0027s\r\npopulation consists of Montserratans who have been\r\ndisplaced by volcanic eruption. This has meant expanding\r\nour infrastructure to accommodate the unfortunate souls\r\nfrom the Emerald Isle.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda supports the concept of UNDP\r\nand the United Nations Population Fund working with\r\nand rendering assistance to countries described as having\r\ntransition economies, as well as countries which have\r\nsuffered the ravages of internecine warfare, that have\r\nabsorbed significant numbers of refugees and which are\r\nsubject to many vulnerabilities, including natural disasters,\r\nand are victims of economic practices which work against\r\ntheir advancement. The work of UNDP is valued\r\nworldwide, and countries which are most vulnerable\r\nshould certainly be at the forefront for assistance and\r\nguidance. We have to ask once again if we must be\r\npenalized because of our successes. I sincerely hope that\r\nin this body, particularly among the major financial\r\ncontributors, that it is not the view that small island\r\ndeveloping States cannot advance beyond a certain level\r\nof development, as, otherwise, they would be\r\noverreaching themselves and delving into a domain\r\nreserved for members of a certain club. Antigua and\r\nBarbuda takes its role in the United Nations very\r\nseriously and will remain dedicated to the principle of\r\negalitarianism.\r\nWe annually recite our vulnerabilities, paying most\r\nattention to the furore of natural disasters, and over the\r\nlast 10 years my country has experienced four hurricanes.\r\nWhereas it is a glorious sight to witness volcanic\r\neruptions in Montserrat from Antigua, the reality of the\r\ndangerous consequences is always present. We are\r\nadditionally faced with the activities of Kick\u0027em Jenny, an\r\nundersea volcano off the spice island of Grenada. The\r\nCaribbean Development Bank is providing a grant to the\r\nSeismic Research Unit of the University of the West\r\nIndies for the establishment of a mechanism for\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\ncontinuous monitoring of the volcano. According to one\r\nscholar,\r\n“Not only will the communities of the Grenadines and\r\nnearby islands have to guard against debris ejected\r\nduring a volcanic explosion, but the entire Caribbean\r\nwill be jeopardized by the threat of seismic waves,\r\nknown as tsunami”.\r\nThis is yet another example of our vulnerability.\r\nIrrespective of our trials, tribulations and unfair\r\ncastigations, my country, when appraised objectively, has\r\nbeen considered a marvel; hence its continued high ranking\r\non the human development index. We practise the\r\nWestminster model of parliamentary democracy and do so\r\neffectively. Our national elections are open and transparent.\r\nOur first national hero, Sir Vere Cornwall Bird,\r\nappropriately dubbed Father of the Nation, died this year,\r\nand Members of Parliament in both the House and the\r\nSenate were lavish in their praise of one who was\r\ninternationally acclaimed — particularly in Africa, where he\r\nhad an impact on many of its leaders, both during and after\r\nthe colonial era, and in the African diaspora of the New\r\nWorld.\r\nWe have remained committed to the empowerment of\r\nthe socially and economically challenged. Women occupy\r\nsenior positions in the civil service and are represented in\r\nsignificant numbers in the professions. In one they\r\noutnumber men. In the area of violence against women,\r\nlegislation has been enacted to give greater protection to the\r\nfemale members of our society. In the desire of the\r\nGovernment to ensure that its people enjoy a decent\r\nstandard of living and an improved quality of life, the\r\nGovernment has energetically tackled this responsibility.\r\nAnd, in the absence of truly vibrant private sectors to lead\r\neconomic growth and development as in developed\r\ncountries, the tasks performed by the Government have\r\nexpanded and have become more demanding.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda has, however, never been short\r\non ideas as to how to help itself and as to how it can be\r\nassisted internationally in overcoming vulnerability and\r\naccelerating sustainable development. Sustainable\r\ndevelopment is foremost in our thinking. At the sixth\r\nmeeting of the Commonwealth Consultative Group on\r\nEnvironment at the United Nations in April, we received\r\nsupport from the attending States for the ideas posited.\r\nIn the first place, Antigua and Barbuda hopes that the\r\nvulnerability index being developed by the Commonwealth\r\nsecretariat and the World Bank task force will be\r\nintroduced as soon as possible into international\r\norganizations. This must be borne in mind from the\r\nperspective that we have repeatedly addressed the\r\nlimitations and unfairness of using per capita income in\r\nassessing our economic efficacy.\r\nSecondly, following the decision of the disputes\r\ntribunal of the World Trade Organization supporting the\r\ncontention of the discrimination directed at the banana\r\nregime operating under the Lomé Treaty, there is an\r\nurgent need for the World Trade Organization to apply\r\nspecial and differential treatment to small island\r\ndeveloping States as it does to least developed countries.\r\nIf markets in Europe are eroded for small States, those\r\nStates will deteriorate economically, socially and\r\npolitically to the point of placing yet another burden on\r\nthe international community. This deduction is made from\r\nan analysis of the dispute tribunal\u0027s ruling, which suggests\r\nthat the entire quota system for imports by the European\r\nUnion from the African-Caribbean-Pacific countries for\r\nall products is now under threat.\r\nIn the third place, we would like to reiterate the call\r\nmade for a disaster fund in 1995 by our Prime Minister,\r\nThe Right Honourable Lester Bird. He made that call\r\nfollowing the devastation of hurricane Luis, which wiped\r\nout one year of Antigua and Barbuda\u0027s gross domestic\r\nproduct in 36 perilous hours. Whereas the existing\r\nmechanisms address the purpose of relieving immediate\r\nsuffering and agony, they are woefully insufficient for\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation.\r\nAs one who represents his country on the Committee\r\nof 24, the so-called Decolonization Committee, I was\r\nsomewhat taken aback to hear the Foreign Minister of a\r\ncountry that had previously supported non-intervention\r\nstate that the United Nations has failed to address well-\r\nknown conflicts of catastrophic proportions in a timely\r\nmanner. It would therefore seem that more and more\r\ncountries are moving towards the acceptance of joint\r\naction in a given country if there is a clear case of\r\ngenocide and a total violation of human rights.\r\nWhat happened in East Timor goes well beyond the\r\npoint of frustration. Since my country has from quite\r\nearly on advocated the right of the people of Western\r\nSahara to self-determination, we have been saddened each\r\ntime that plans for a referendum among the Sahraoui\r\npeople have been delayed. We believe that each and every\r\npostponement interferes with and impedes the will of self-\r\ndetermination. The happenings in East Timor will have a\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nfurther impact on the will of the staunch and hardy\r\nSahraoui people, and this gives us cause for great concern.\r\nIt is important that everything be done to avoid a repetition\r\nof what has happened in East Timor after people have\r\nexercised their right of self-determination.\r\nLike other countries, my country believes that\r\nintervention in affairs within another State should be the\r\nlast resort. But there are many questions to be answered in\r\nregard to oppression, degradation and dehumanization. The\r\nEast Timor example should set us working to avoid another\r\ncatastrophe of that magnitude. I have long marvelled at the\r\nprophetic brilliance of the former Foreign Minister of\r\nUruguay, Eduardo Rodríguez Larreta, who in 1946 argued\r\nthat non-intervention could not be converted into a right to\r\nconvoke one principle in order to violate all other principles\r\nwith impunity. Nothing, however, is being advocated here\r\nexcept that we address ourselves meaningfully towards\r\nmeasures to avoid another East Timor.\r\nSo much have we been looking forward to the new\r\nmillennium that we have defied the laws of mathematics\r\nand brought forward the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury by making it come about in the last year of the\r\ntwentieth century. Even at the United Nations is the year\r\n2000 being proclaimed as the beginning of the new\r\nmillennium. Be that as it may, it is not sufficient to\r\nproclaim a new millennium and to have the grand, planned\r\ncelebration. The commitment to the eradication of poverty,\r\nthe achievement of peace and security and cooperation for\r\ndevelopment should be sincere, meaningful and followed\r\nthrough to the level of profound accomplishment.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda cherishes the United Nations and\r\nis not unmindful of the numerous advances that have come\r\nabout as a result of its impact in conflict resolution, the\r\nmaintenance of peace, the shelter and sanctuary provided to\r\nrefugees, the promotion of human rights, the eradication of\r\ncertain diseases and numerous other tangibles. Thus,\r\nAntigua and Barbuda remains ready to continue\r\ncontributing to the advancement of humanity and will, as it\r\nhas done in the past, insist on the principle of\r\nmultilateralism. Together, our countries, large and small,\r\ncan make contributions in overcoming the plagues with\r\nwhich we are afflicted and move towards peace, cohesion,\r\nharmony and the alleviation of poverty in the coming\r\ncentury.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last speaker\r\nin the general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second\r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Mutaboba (Rwanda): My delegation had not\r\nintended to take the floor, but after hearing the baseless\r\nallegations and lucubrations of Minister Elodia Ndombasi\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I felt\r\ncompelled to speak in order to set the record straight.\r\nThe international community is well aware of the\r\ntragedy that Rwanda endured and which culminated in the\r\ngenocide of 1994. The Minister from the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo speaks of aggression. We will be\r\nbrief in addressing this issue, because it would take us too\r\nlong to respond to his long and confusing speech. But the\r\nfirst aggression was against Rwanda and started when the\r\ngenocidal army was allowed to enter the territory of\r\nZaire — today the Democratic Republic of the Congo —\r\nwith its weapons.\r\nSecondly, they were allowed to regroup, train and\r\nrecruit from the refugee camps in broad daylight. Those\r\nrefugee camps, my delegation wishes to remind the\r\nAssembly, were located along the border of Rwanda and\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. In that way they\r\nwere fed and granted refugee status, in contravention of\r\nall provisions of the Organization\u0027s Charter.\r\nThirdly, quite a large number of Rwandans — about\r\n2 million — were held hostage by these criminal forces,\r\nwho had the support of the late President Mobutu. This\r\nwent on for quite a long time and culminated in cross-\r\nborder attacks.\r\nWhat today\u0027s Congolese leadership, under President\r\nKabila, cannot deny is its grateful acceptance of the\r\nassistance that it sought and obtained from Rwanda and\r\nothers in the liberation war against Mobutu and his\r\ndictatorship. The authorities of the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo did acknowledge that assistance, as\r\nindicated in document S/1999/205. In paragraph 9 of that\r\ndocument, the Congolese authorities stated that\r\n“the Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la\r\nLibération du Congo (ADFL) had accepted military\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nand logistical assistance from several friendly\r\ncountries, including Rwanda and Uganda.”\r\nIn paragraph 10, they recognize the quid pro quo of\r\nthis assistance in the following words:\r\n“Those two countries would benefit from\r\nproviding that assistance since an incidental\r\nconsequence of the war of liberation was the\r\nelimination of tension along their borders which posed\r\na threat to their security and, in particular, the\r\nneutralization of members of the former Rwandan\r\narmed forces (FAR), Hutu rebels (Interahamwe) and\r\nLord\u0027s Resistance Army soldiers.”\r\nThat is the same army which is being pursued for\r\n2,000 kilometres.\r\nThere are many examples we could give which clearly\r\npoint to the twin root causes of the 1997 crisis in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. At this stage it would\r\nbe pointless to go back to fuelling the crisis. As far as the\r\nsecurity of the region and of the neighbouring countries is\r\nconcerned, there are internal problems in the Congo as well\r\nas external links. Whether or not the Congolese authorities\r\nrecognize this, it is a fact, and we should distinguish\r\nbetween fact and fiction and between perception and reality.\r\nWhen we hear the same authorities, including the\r\nMinister who just spoke, say that those who committed\r\ngenocide in Rwanda were justified and deserve support now\r\nas they did in the past, these and other similar quotations\r\nare actionable statements for which the Government of\r\nPresident Kabila have to answer before a relevant court.\r\nIn another statement, the official media of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in Kinshasa called on\r\nthe population to treat the enemy as “a virus, a mosquito or\r\ngarbage which must be crushed with determination and\r\nwithout pity”. Those words were said by the same Minister\r\nwho is fuelling the crisis we are trying to resolve today.\r\nWhen I hear such inflammatory speeches in the\r\nAssembly, it reminds me that the last time I saw such a\r\nfiasco was in the biggest market in Ethiopia. There is a\r\nsimilarity between that market and this Assembly. It is a\r\npity.\r\nBut when we look back at the work of the Security\r\nCouncil, we can see that the commissions that were set up\r\nto deal with the crisis are no longer active, But we have to\r\ndetermine and deal with the root causes, especially because\r\nof the cycle of impunity, where the same offenders\r\ncontinue to commit crimes without being punished. That\r\nis wrong. That is why, by paragraph 1 of its resolution\r\n1161 (1998) of 9 April 1998, the Security Council\r\nrequested that the Secretary-General of this Organization\r\nreactivate the International Commission of Inquiry, with\r\nthe following mandate:\r\n“(a) to collect information and investigate\r\nreports relating to the sale, supply and shipment of\r\narms and related matériel to former Rwandan\r\ngovernment forces and militias in the Great Lakes\r\nregion of central Africa, in violation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 918 (1994), 997 (1995) and 1011\r\n(1995);\r\n“(b) to identify parties aiding and abetting the\r\nlegal sale to or acquisition of arms by former\r\nRwandan government forces and militias, contrary to\r\nthe resolutions referred to above;\r\n“(c) to make recommendations relating to the\r\nillegal flow of arms in the Great Lakes region.”\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nParagraph 87 of the report of the International\r\nCommission of Inquiry, contained in document\r\nS/1998/1096, states,\r\n“Persistent reports received by the Commission\r\nfrom numerous sources across southern Africa\r\noverwhelmingly attest to this transformation: that the\r\nex-FAR and Interahamwe, once a defeated and\r\ndispersed remnant, have now become a significant\r\ncomponent of the international alliance against the\r\nCongolese rebels and their presumed sponsors,\r\nRwanda and Uganda. The Commission is convinced\r\nthat the ex-FAR and Interahamwe have continued to\r\nreceive arms and ammunition, both through their close\r\nlinks with other armed groups in Angola, Burundi,\r\nUganda and elsewhere, and most recently, from the\r\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nDespite the imposition upon them of a Security\r\nCouncil arms embargo, which has remained in force\r\nsince the genocide of 1994, the ex-FAR and\r\nInterahamwe have now become in effect the allies of\r\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and its allies, the Governments of Angola,\r\nChad, Namibia and Zimbabwe. The new relationship\r\nhas conferred a form of legitimacy on the\r\nInterahamwe and the ex-FAR. This is a profoundly\r\nshocking state of affairs.”\r\nIn that light, we would like to draw the attention of\r\nthe Assembly to the sanctions Committee referred to in\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1161 (1998) of 9 April 1998. It\r\nis still in place and should be reactivated in order to\r\nmonitor the situation closely to find out what is going on.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to ask the Assembly\r\nto make sure that, once and for all, we move forward in\r\nresolving the crisis in the Congo. The solution remains the\r\ndisarming of those criminals who have been perpetuating\r\nthe genocide all over the region, and carrying with them the\r\nideology of genocide. If we do not do so, and if we do not\r\ndivert the attention of the public away from that ideology,\r\nwe will not resolve the problems but create even more of\r\nthem.\r\nMr. Acemah (Uganda): Uganda\u0027s position on the\r\ninternal conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nis well known. It has been clearly enunciated here in the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in the Security Council, in the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and elsewhere. Ugandan\r\ntroops are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a\r\nresult of a bilateral agreement between the two countries.\r\nMy Minister made clear his position on that issue last week\r\nin our policy statement to the General Assembly at this\r\nfifty-fourth session. I shall therefore not waste the\r\nprecious time of the General Assembly with a repetition\r\nour well-known position.\r\nI would, however, like to deny categorically the\r\nfalse, malicious and gratuitous allegations made this\r\nafternoon by the representative of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo against Uganda. I would like to\r\nreiterate that Uganda is committed to the implementation\r\nof the Lusaka Agreement. We hope that all signatories,\r\nincluding the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are\r\ncommitted to the success of the Lusaka Agreement. I\r\nhardly need remind the representative of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo that, without the support of the\r\nGovernment and people of Uganda, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo would today most probably still be\r\ncalled Zaire and would be under the dictatorship of\r\nMobutu Sese Seko and his cronies. The representative\r\nwould most likely be hiding somewhere in the jungles of\r\nthe Congo. The unnecessary diatribe which the\r\nrepresentative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nunleashed against Uganda is clearly in violation of the\r\nletter, and certainly of the spirit, of the Lusaka\r\nAgreement, which his President signed and promised to\r\nuphold.\r\nMr. Mwamba Kapanga (Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo) (spoke in French): I do not intend to launch\r\ninto polemics. I would simply like to reply briefly to the\r\nstatements made by the representatives of Rwanda and\r\nUganda.\r\nI shall start by saying that, indeed, there was\r\ngenocide in Rwanda, and 500,000 people met their deaths\r\nin the course of that genocide, which took place in 1994.\r\nHowever, I must also add that the genocide was\r\nperpetrated by Rwandans, against Rwandans, on Rwandan\r\nsoil. Not a single Congolese went to Rwanda to kill a\r\nsingle Rwandan. On the contrary, the Congolese people\r\nwere obliged to receive in their own land more than 1.2\r\nmillion Rwandans, and it is those Rwandans who have\r\ncreated the poverty and the desolation in the east of our\r\ncountry.\r\nYes, there was genocide in Rwanda, and we have\r\nacknowledged the fact. That genocide caused the deaths\r\nof civilians. But the fact that there was genocide in\r\nRwanda, perpetrated by Rwandans against Rwandans,\r\ndoes not mean that today we must tolerate the soldiers\r\nsent by Rwanda into Congolese territory to kill the people\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 17th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 29 September 1999\r\nof the Congo — massacres that can only be considered acts\r\nof genocide against the Congolese people.\r\nThe Rwandans say they are on Congolese soil for\r\nreasons of security. That was the argument that was made\r\nat the beginning of the war, but later we all discovered that\r\nRwandans were really on our soil not in the interests of the\r\nsecurity of Rwanda, as the Minister claimed, but rather\r\nbecause of the Congo\u0027s resources. The recent battles in\r\nKisangani proved that to us. The Rwandan and Ugandan\r\npress have said that the Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers\r\nfought on Congolese territory not over matters of security\r\nbut to control the resources of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo.\r\nI should like to say briefly that my country has\r\ncommitted itself to respecting the Lusaka Agreement, and\r\nwe intend to do so. We are prepared to ensure that the\r\nAgreement is implemented. But I must also say that it is\r\nnot the Democratic Republic of the Congo that is holding\r\nup the implementation of the Agreement; it is, rather,\r\nthose who say that they want peace and security in the\r\nregion. Today they are in the process of massing their\r\ntroops, bringing in more weapons and occupying new\r\nareas. If they truly wished for a ceasefire and for peace,\r\nthey would not have continued to do that after signing the\r\nLusaka Agreement.\r\nI should like to repeat very clearly that the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has committed itself\r\nto respecting the Lusaka Agreement. That is why we\r\nrequested the Security Council and the Secretary-General\r\nof the United Nations to speed up the process of\r\nimplementing the peace Agreement by sending the\r\npeacekeeping force as soon as possible so that peace can\r\nprevail, not only in the Congo, but throughout the entire\r\nGreat Lakes region.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.40 p.m.\r\n40\r\n"
