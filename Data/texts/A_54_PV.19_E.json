(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of\r\nthe Republic of Mozambique\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Mozambique.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, His Excellency\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Chissano: On behalf of my Government\r\nand on my own behalf, I wish to join previous speakers in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, most sincerely on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. Your election to this high office is a matter of\r\nhonour to all Africans and to the United Nations family, for\r\nyou represent a nation whose plight remained on the agenda\r\nof this Organization for many years. The attainment of the\r\nindependence of Namibia, the last stronghold of colonialism\r\nin the African continent, and the subsequent political,\r\neconomic and social developments that have occurred in the\r\nlast few years, have indeed paved the way for the\r\nconsolidation of the process of political integration of\r\nsouthern Africa. We wish you well in your new\r\nresponsibilities, and are confident that this body will be\r\nwell served in the months ahead. We shall cooperate with\r\nyou in every way we can.\r\nA well-deserved tribute is also due to your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti of\r\nUruguay, for the exemplary manner in which he\r\nspearheaded the proceedings of the Organization during\r\nthe last session.\r\nI would also like to express my high regard to the\r\nSecretary-General for his continued commitment to\r\ninternational peace and security and for his leadership in\r\ndealing with an ever-increasing array of challenges\r\nworldwide. I wish to encourage him to continue on this\r\npositive path.\r\nMy Government welcomes the recent admission to\r\nthe membership of the United Nations of the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga. We are certain that the new Members will further\r\nenhance the universal nature of our Organization.\r\nI have come to the General Assembly first as a\r\nmessenger of a people — the Mozambican people — who\r\nhave embarked on a long process of political, economic\r\nand social stabilization, following years of instability. The\r\nprocess of consolidating Mozambique’s young, multiparty\r\ndemocracy is making steady progress. Step by step, our\r\ncountry is returning to normalcy, though we are conscious\r\nof the hurdles still ahead.\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nWe are currently preparing for the second multiparty\r\npresidential and parliamentary elections, to be held on 3\r\nand 4 December 1999. Periodic genuine elections constitute\r\nan important political exercise, which my Government and\r\nI are committed to pursuing vigorously with a view to\r\nensuring lasting peace and stability in Mozambique.\r\nIn the past five years of pluralistic democracy we have\r\nregistered important advances in the consolidation of\r\nnation-building through collective efforts involving all\r\nlayers of society. Taking advantage of its diversity and\r\nvitality, our Parliament has held fruitful discussion, which\r\nresulted in the adoption of new laws that are contributing\r\npositively to the revitalization of political, economic and\r\nsocial institutions as well as to the consolidation of peace\r\nand democracy.\r\nMore important, this forum has contributed to the\r\ncreation among parliamentarians of a new vision and\r\nunderstanding of the facts about our country and a vision of\r\na united nation pursuing peace, progress and prosperity for\r\nall Mozambicans, thus consolidating national reconciliation.\r\nThe period under review has equally witnessed significant\r\neconomic and social progress. We are proud that this has\r\nbeen highlighted and commended by well-advised outside\r\nobservers and by many of the most respected organizations\r\nand institutions as a good example of commitment to\r\nimplement economic reforms.\r\nThe Mozambican economy has grown at encouraging\r\nrates, resulting in the allocation of an increased share of the\r\nnational budget to the social sectors. The whole network of\r\nschools and health facilities destroyed during the years of\r\ndestabilization has been rebuilt, and most roads and bridges\r\nare under rehabilitation.\r\nMy Government has succeeded in creating a more\r\nenabling environment for private investment by redefining\r\nits role as facilitator. We have identified and established\r\nspecial incentive schemes in various areas with higher\r\npotential for development. These incentives are aimed at\r\nbringing new investments to a number of areas in order to\r\ndevelop internationally competitive economic zones, create\r\nemployment opportunities and promote sustainable\r\neconomic growth. They are also intended to bring about\r\nbalanced development of the whole country, bearing in\r\nmind that some areas were neglected during colonial times.\r\nThe streamlining of investment procedures, coupled\r\nwith political stability, has contributed to the attraction of\r\nlarge investments such as the Maputo Development\r\nCorridor project. The concept of development corridors is\r\nan initiative regarded as the cornerstone of the regional\r\nintegration strategy involving the countries of the\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC).\r\nOther transfrontier and national programmes in\r\npartnership with other countries of the region play a\r\nmajor role in this process. These include strategic projects\r\nsuch as the $1.3-billion Mozal aluminium smelter plant to\r\nbe completed within one year and the projected $2-billion\r\nMaputo iron and steel plant; both are part of the Maputo\r\nDevelopment Corridor project. The construction of\r\nanother $600-million iron and steel plant and the\r\nconstruction of a new port in Savane are envisaged as\r\npart of the Beira Corridor. Gas projects in the southern\r\nand central regions of Mozambique, as well as sugar\r\nplants and tourism, are other undertakings of great\r\nimportance being developed in Mozambique with the\r\nparticipation of other SADC countries.\r\nThe ambitious plan for the development of integrated\r\nprogrammes and projects in the Zambezi river basin, an\r\nextensive and potentially rich part of Mozambique,\r\ninclude the construction of a big hydroelectric dam at\r\nM’panda M’kua. The Zambezi valley covers more than\r\n200,000 square kilometres, nearly one third of our\r\nnational territory, and is endowed with a variety of\r\nresources of strategic importance, which we intend to\r\ndevelop in order to bring about sustainable development\r\nfor our country and for the SADC region. The Cabora\r\nBassa dam is already supplying electricity to Zimbabwe\r\nand to South Africa.\r\nMozambique will thus be in a position to use its\r\ngeostrategic location to make a greater contribution\r\ntowards the integrated development of the southern\r\nAfrican region; this is one of the building blocks of\r\ncontinental integration.\r\nWe believe that cooperative interaction involving\r\nvarious segments of society, including the private sector,\r\nis the key to the promotion of sustainable development\r\nthrough a smart partnership in which all stakeholders will\r\nbenefit.\r\nI come to this Assembly also as a messenger of the\r\npeoples of southern Africa, a region striving to develop as\r\na community of nations and peoples at peace with itself\r\nand with others and working towards balanced and\r\nintegrated development. Last month, the people and the\r\nGovernment of Mozambique were honoured to host the\r\nnineteenth Summit of Heads of State or Government of\r\nour community, the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity. The Maputo Summit was held on the theme\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\n“SADC in the next millennium: working together for peace,\r\nprogress and prosperity”. It brought together heads of State\r\nor Government and other high-ranking representatives of all\r\nits 14 member States and, as guests, the heads of State of\r\nNigeria, Uganda and Rwanda, the Secretary-General of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), the Executive\r\nSecretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, as well\r\nas other dignitaries representing a variety of other regional\r\nand international organizations.\r\nIn reviewing the progress made over the previous 12\r\nmonths, the Summit noted with satisfaction that the\r\neconomies of the Community continued to grow at in\r\naverage rate of 3 per cent, thanks to sound macroeconomic\r\npolicies implemented by member States and to the\r\nharmonization and coordination of activities towards\r\neconomic integration. However, in order to eradicate\r\npoverty, the region needs to grow at an average rate of 6\r\nper cent per year. To achieve this objective we need to\r\nmobilize more regional resources as well as to consolidate\r\nan enabling environment to increase the share of foreign\r\ndirect investment. We have once again resolved to commit\r\nourselves to ensure that all of our countries and peoples can\r\nbenefit as they must from the globalization process. To that\r\nend, efforts will continue to be made to consolidate peace\r\nthroughout the region, to harmonize sectoral policies and to\r\nimplement sound economic policies.\r\nDuring the Maputo Summit, the heads of State and\r\nGovernment signed three important documents: on wildlife,\r\non health and on productivity. They welcomed the recent\r\nentry into force of the SADC Protocols on Shared\r\nWatercourse Systems, on Energy, on Transport,\r\nCommunications and Meteorology, and on Combating Illicit\r\nDrug Trafficking, and the charter of the Regional Tourism\r\nOrganization of Southern Africa. The entry into force of the\r\nTrade Protocol on 1 January 2000 will bring additional\r\nopportunities and challenges to our region, and will enhance\r\nthe programme initiated a few years ago with the entry into\r\nforce of other protocols. All these legal instruments are,\r\nindeed, important steps towards regional integration leading\r\nto a better future.\r\nIn southern Africa, HIV/AIDS is spreading at an\r\nalarming rate. Governments in the SADC region, aware of\r\nthe far-reaching negative consequences, are seeking\r\ncollective and individual strategies to counter the spread of\r\nAIDS. In Lusaka, Zambia, we met at a regional level to\r\nlook into advisable approaches that can enhance awareness\r\nwithin each country and to consider measures that can help\r\nGovernments to mobilize financial and human resources to\r\nface this global threat. We have no choice: either we stop\r\nthe spread of AIDS or we risk putting the viability of our\r\nsocieties at stake, because in our region the most qualified\r\npeople are the ones at high risk.\r\nThis scenario foretells our future. Our economic,\r\nsocial and political development will remain on the\r\nhorizon, and the structures of our societies will be\r\nseriously undermined, unless effective, concrete steps are\r\ntaken. In this context, my Government very recently\r\nadopted a national strategy against HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe resolution on cooperation between SADC and\r\nthe United Nations to be adopted this year must reflect\r\nthe positive progress that has taken place within SADC,\r\nand stress the importance of greater interaction with the\r\nUnited Nations in all fields of common interest. At the\r\nsame time, our Community — which is built on\r\ndemocratic principles, equitable and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, improved living standards of citizens, free\r\nmovement of factors of production, goods and services —\r\nremains equally committed to strengthening its\r\nrelationship with other regional organizations.\r\nThe search for a durable peace is still a constant\r\nobjective of the region. It is for this reason that we\r\nwelcome the progress made in the settlement of the\r\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The\r\nsigning of the agreement by all parties opens a new era\r\nfor the region and beyond. What is required now is for\r\nthe international community, particularly the United\r\nNations, to meet its responsibilities by sending, as\r\nexpeditiously as possible, peacekeeping forces with an\r\nappropriate mandate and adequate resources, under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter, for the achievement of lasting\r\npeace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nWe hope that the progress to which I have referred\r\nto above will make a positive impact on the Angolan\r\nconflict. The people of Angola must be given the\r\nopportunity to live in peace and harmony. The\r\ninternational community has a moral and political\r\nobligation to assist the Angolans to reverse the\r\nhumanitarian tragedy which is unfolding in vast areas of\r\ntheir territory. At the same time, the international\r\ncommunity, while supporting the Government of Angola\r\nin restoring peace and stability in that country, must call\r\non Mr. Savimbi to abandon his aggressive and\r\nirresponsible action. In particular, the Security Council\r\nsanctions imposed on UNITA must be fully observed, in\r\norder to prevent further suffering in that SADC country.\r\nIn this context, we salute the positive work already done\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nby Ambassador Robert Fowler, Chairman of the Security\r\nCouncil sanctions committee, and we encourage him to\r\ncontinue with his work.\r\nThis is our vision of the future of Mozambique as an\r\nindividual country and also that of SADC as a whole.\r\nThe recurrence of conflicts in Africa has exacerbated\r\nthe plight of children as the main victims. The recent\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) summit, held in\r\nAlgiers, echoing the recommendations of the African\r\nConference on the Use of Children as Soldiers, held in\r\nMaputo in April this year, adopted a resolution calling,\r\ninter alia, for the elaboration of an international convention\r\noutlawing the use of children under 18 years of age in\r\narmed conflicts. We urge all members of the United\r\nNations to adhere to and support this initiative, which, in\r\nour view, must be associated with all other rights of the\r\nchild.\r\nWe believe that the implementation of that OAU\r\nresolution, together with the concept of “children as zone\r\nof peace” would constitute a valuable contribution to the\r\nprotection of children. In this regard, I commend the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary General on Children and\r\nArmed Conflict and non-governmental organizations for\r\ntheir relentless efforts to promote and ensure respect for the\r\nrights of the child.\r\nMoreover, the proliferation of small arms and light\r\nweapons, together with transnational crimes such as money\r\nlaundering and drug trafficking, constitute major sources of\r\ninstability for many countries, including my own. We in\r\nsouthern Africa are undertaking a coordinated action with\r\na view to addressing these challenges and bringing about\r\npeace and stability.\r\nIn May this year Maputo hosted the First Meeting of\r\nStates parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the\r\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on their Destruction. The Maputo Meeting was\r\nheld when thousands of innocent civilians were being\r\nmaimed in many parts of the world, including my own\r\ncountry. The Meeting adopted a Declaration calling upon us\r\nto rededicate ourselves in the struggle against these\r\ninsidious weapons, in fulfilment of our obligations under\r\nthe Ottawa Convention. More important, the Maputo\r\nMeeting offered a unique opportunity to remind the\r\ninternational community of the need to meet the targets set\r\nby the Convention. In four years we must destroy all\r\nanti-personnel mines in warehouses, and in ten years we\r\nmust complete the demining process in affected countries.\r\nAs we concluded in Maputo, these targets are\r\nnon-negotiable. What is negotiable is the ways and means\r\nfor the attainment of these objectives. We therefore call\r\nupon all States and organizations in a position to do so to\r\nensure that these goals are met. Failure to reach these\r\ngoals would undermine the credibility of the international\r\ncommunity and, above all, the universalization of the\r\nConvention. It is our earnest hope that the General\r\nAssembly will give additional impetus to the momentum\r\ncreated by the adoption of the Maputo Declaration.\r\nWe in southern Africa are disturbed about the low\r\nlevels of foreign direct investment in Africa. We are\r\ndeeply concerned about recent evidence presented by the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nshowing a drastic reduction in official development\r\nassistance, in particular for Africa. More worrisome is the\r\nfact that the target of 0.7 per cent in official development\r\nassistance has never been entirely met, and, on the\r\ncontrary, it has reached only one third of the established\r\ntarget.\r\nLack of adequate funding has contributed to poor\r\nrealization of the goals set by major international\r\nconferences, including those contained in the Cairo\r\nProgramme of Action, which was reviewed during the\r\nrecently held twenty-first special session of the General\r\nAssembly on population and development.\r\nWithout political will there will be no sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the global economy, and the risk of the\r\nfurther marginalization of developing countries, with all\r\nof its negative consequences, will remain high.\r\nIn addition, the issue of external indebtedness\r\ncontinues to be the single most important obstacle to the\r\ndevelopment of many countries, particularly in Africa.\r\nEfforts must be made to ensure that the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative is accessible to the\r\ncountries in need.\r\nAs I speak on this issue, I must once again thank the\r\ninternational community for the assistance rendered to\r\nMozambique under this Initiative, as of last June. The fact\r\nof the matter, however, is that our debt burden continues\r\nto undermine our efforts to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We believe it is high time for the\r\ninternational community to start writing off the external\r\ndebt of those countries that have made visible and\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nsustainable progress in the implementation of tough\r\nstructural adjustment measures and political reforms. Such\r\na course of action would undoubtedly provide more\r\nincentives for other countries to undertake these measures\r\nand to redirect resources to the social sectors, in particular\r\nfor the provision of water and better education and to fight\r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nMy Government wishes to commend the 5 May\r\nAgreement signed by the Governments of Indonesia,\r\nPortugal and United Nations which culminated in the\r\nholding of a referendum in East Timor. We salute the\r\npeople of East Timor for the exemplary and orderly manner\r\nin which they participated in the referendum and for the\r\nclear and unequivocal way in which they decided for\r\nindependence. We are deeply saddened and gravely\r\nconcerned over the tragic developments that have followed\r\nthe announcement of the results of the referendum. We are\r\nparticularly distressed over the fact that massacres against\r\ninnocent civilians and indiscriminate destruction of property\r\nhave occurred, largely due to the failure by Indonesia to\r\nsecure order and by the international community to act\r\nexpeditiously.\r\nThe fact that the East Timor tragedy occurred when\r\nsimilar situations had been prevented not long ago leads us\r\nto believe in the existence of passivity and selectivity in\r\ndealing with issues that undermine international peace and\r\nsecurity. We nevertheless commend the decision taken by\r\nthe Security Council to send a mission to Jakarta and Dili\r\nand the subsequent actions taken with the cooperation of\r\nthe Government of Indonesia.\r\nAlong with restoring peace and stability, efforts must\r\nbe made to provide a speedy humanitarian response to\r\nassist the people who were displaced or became refugees as\r\na result of the unprecedented levels of violence we have\r\nwitnessed in that territory. The tragedy in East Timor\r\nunderlines the importance of translating into deeds the\r\nrelevant recommendations contained in the “Report of the\r\nSecretary-General to the Security Council on the protection\r\nof civilians in armed conflict”.\r\nMozambique has given its modest contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in East Timor and stands ready to\r\ncontinue to play a role in future efforts of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nOn behalf of my Government and on my own behalf,\r\nI wish to seize this opportunity to convey our deepest\r\nsympathy to those who have lost their loved ones. It is our\r\nhope that their suffering will not be in vain, and that the\r\nUnited Nations and all parties will ensure the early\r\nimplementation of the results of the referendum.\r\nThe issue of East Timor reminds us of other people\r\nwho are striving for self-determination. We are\r\nencouraged by the latest positive developments that have\r\ntaken place in the Middle East. They confirm that, with\r\nthe necessary political will, taking into account the\r\ninterests of all parties to the conflict, peace is possible in\r\nthat region. Our task is to help the Palestinians and the\r\nIsraelis take maximum advantage of the momentum that\r\nhas been created as a result of the signing of the Sharm\r\nel-Sheik Memorandum, on 4 September 1999, following\r\nthe deadlock in the implementation of the Wye River\r\nMemorandum of 23 October 1998. Success in the\r\nimplementation of the current Memorandum depends on\r\nstrict observance of the principle of land for peace.\r\nRecent incidents along the common border between\r\nIndia and Pakistan are a source of great concern to all\r\npeace-loving countries. We call upon both Governments\r\nto exercise maximum restraint and to refrain from taking\r\nactions that might jeopardize further the already volatile\r\nsituation along their common border.\r\nIt is our earnest hope that the United Nations\r\nintervention in Kosovo will bring lasting peace and\r\nstability to that territory and the region. To this end\r\nMozambique is contributing with a small team of police\r\nofficers.\r\nWe equally hope that now that the Lockerbie issue\r\nis in the hands of justice, the Security Council will\r\nhonour its undertakings by lifting the sanctions on Libya.\r\nBoth the final settlement of this issue and the holding of\r\na referendum in Western Sahara will have a positive\r\nimpact on the development of Africa.\r\nWe are at the threshold of the next century, and the\r\nchallenges ahead are enormous. They require stronger\r\ncommitment and greater international cooperation. In this\r\nconnection, we wish to commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor organizing the Millennium Assembly and the\r\nmillennium summit for the year 2000. Indeed, there could\r\nbe no better way to inaugurate the new era than by\r\nassembling all world leaders to reflect on the strategies\r\nand policies that will govern our planet in the next\r\nmillennium. Whatever themes we choose to debate, they\r\nshould include the promotion of a culture of peace within\r\nnations, regions and throughout the world, for this will\r\nallow the realization of all other objectives, in particular\r\nthe eradication of poverty, promotion of development,\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nprotection of human rights and meeting the challenges of\r\nglobalization.\r\nIt is therefore our hope that the forthcoming historic\r\ngatherings will signal the beginning of the crystallization of\r\nthe process of building a better and safer world by\r\nproducing meaningful strategies, actions and policies that\r\nwill guide the United Nations of tomorrow. We agree that\r\nthese high-level events should not result merely in the\r\nadoption of declarations that cannot be translated into\r\nconcrete actions for both the United Nations and\r\nGovernments.\r\nWe should therefore aim at pragmatic, action-oriented\r\nand implementable decisions. Then, and only then, shall we\r\nmeet the aspirations of the founding fathers of our universal\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of\r\nMozambique for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Bartholomew Ulufa’alu,\r\nPrime Minister of the Solomon Islands\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands.\r\nThe Honourable Bartholomew Ulufa’alu, Prime\r\nMinister of the Solomon Islands, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming the\r\nPrime Minister of the Solomon Islands, His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Bartholomew Ulufa’alu, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Ulufu’alu (Solomon Islands): Let me express my\r\nsincere congratulations, Sir, on your election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. Under your\r\nleadership, I am confident the Assembly will effectively\r\naddress the issues before it.\r\nMy Government salutes the Secretary-General, the\r\nSecretariat and the United Nations agencies for their\r\ndedication and commitment to building peace and\r\nconfidence around the world. The Solomon Islands also\r\napplauds the Secretary-General’s programme of\r\nmodernization and revitalization of the Organization,\r\naimed at creating a more effective United Nations to\r\nbetter serve the development needs of its Members, thus\r\nensuring peace and security in the twenty-first century.\r\nMy country will be a committed partner in achieving this\r\ngoal in the new millennium.\r\nThe Government and people of the Solomon Islands\r\nwarmly welcome the admission of our sister nations —\r\nthe Republic of Nauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga — as new Members of the United\r\nNations. This makes the principle of universality, as\r\nstipulated by the United Nations Charter, a near reality. It\r\nis also further testimony that the United Nations is\r\nindispensable. Its body of international laws is central to\r\nthe protection and security of our small island States.\r\nWhile there have been important successes for the\r\ninternational community, peace and development in many\r\nparts of the world remain precarious. The past decade has\r\nwitnessed the increase in the world’s illicit drug problem\r\nand its related crimes, terrorism, large-scale movement\r\nand trade in small arms and the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction. Equally\r\nalarming is the rise in local and regional conflicts in\r\nvarious parts of the world and the threat they pose to\r\nnational and international peace, stability and\r\nadvancement. Poverty, meanwhile, remains a major\r\nobstacle to the economic progress of many developing\r\ncountries, especially the least developed. In addition, the\r\neconomic threats associated with globalization and trade\r\nliberalization have increased in recent years.\r\nFor small island developing States like the Solomon\r\nIslands, post-cold-war security now embraces human,\r\nenvironmental and economic dimensions. The most\r\nimportant asset of any country is its people. In a small\r\nisland developing State like mine, investment in human-\r\nresource development is not only vital, but a critical\r\nprerequisite to embracing national peace, stability and\r\neconomic prosperity.\r\nIn this connection, the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, as reiterated by many representatives\r\nat the special session earlier this week, remains a valid\r\nblueprint for the sustainable development of small island\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\ndeveloping States, including my country. The environmental\r\nand economic vulnerabilities of small island developing\r\nStates present major difficulties to our efforts to achieve\r\nsustainable development. Climate change and sea-level rise\r\nare matters of survival for the small island developing\r\nStates. Annex I parties must fulfil their commitment under\r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange.\r\nThe increasing incidence and magnitude of natural\r\ndisasters are particularly alarming. On the other hand, the\r\noverall decline in official development assistance flows, the\r\nerosion of trade preferences, falling primary commodity\r\nprices and limited market access could severely harm our\r\nsmall and fragile economies. Hence, greater international\r\nsupport is required for the successful implementation of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action in the future.\r\nMy Government recognizes the importance of good\r\ngovernance to advance human development and to promote\r\nsustained economic growth. We are taking measures\r\ntowards this end. The call for good governance, however,\r\nmust be accompanied by the necessary resources and the\r\ncreation of an enabling regional and international\r\nenvironment.\r\nAllow me to outline the views and some of the steps\r\ntaken by my Government to address some of the\r\naforementioned issues, including our efforts to create and\r\nstrengthen accountable administrative and financial\r\ninstitutions, as well as the appropriate policies and\r\nlegislation.\r\nWhen my Government assumed office in September\r\n1997, we were confronted with a major financial crisis in\r\nthe public sector. The domestic financial system was\r\noverburdened with public debt, which the Government was\r\nunable to service. Additionally, the Asian financial crisis in\r\nlate 1997 further deepened the crisis in the domestic\r\neconomy. The public service was unable to deliver goods\r\nand services effectively and efficiently. The private sector\r\nbecame stagnant. This state of affairs demanded an urgent\r\noverhaul of the public sector and the need to create a\r\nvibrant private sector. Short-term, medium-term and long-\r\nterm measures had to be taken.\r\nThus, my Government responded with a series of\r\npolicy statements committing itself to a broad-based\r\nprogramme of policy and structural reforms. The overall\r\ngoals of the policy and structural-reform programme are to\r\nfoster financial and macroeconomic stability, to establish a\r\nmore effective and efficient public service and to create an\r\nenvironment for the private sector that is conducive to\r\nviable growth and sustainability.\r\nIt is obvious that, although we have the primary\r\nresponsibility to implement our reform initiatives, we\r\ncannot do it alone. The experiences of small economies\r\nthat have undertaken similar reforms indicate that such\r\nreforms can be accelerated by access to capital — often\r\ngrant in aid — technical assistance, technology transfers,\r\nassured markets for primary commodities and links to\r\nnew market locations. Therefore, the political will that my\r\nGovernment has demonstrated has to be supplemented by\r\nsignificant international support if we are to fulfil the\r\naspirations of our people.\r\nI am grateful to our bilateral and multilateral\r\ndevelopment partners for the positive response they have\r\nshown so far towards our reform initiatives. Additional\r\nassistance will be required to implement, in particular, our\r\nmedium-term development strategy and our public sector\r\ninvestment programme.\r\nPeace and development are mutually interdependent.\r\nIn this connection, the current insurgency on the island of\r\nGuadalcanal is a big set-back to our development efforts.\r\nIt has already affected various sectors of the economy and\r\ncaused the displacement of more than 30,000 people.\r\nWhile the crisis may not be comparable to major conflicts\r\nin other parts of the world, its net result in human loss\r\nand suffering is relative. This crisis has to be understood\r\nin the context of our smallness, our limited resources, our\r\nethnic and cultural diversity and our history. The Solomon\r\nIslands, with a population of 400,000, has more than 80\r\ndifferent languages. Thus, if the insurgency is left to\r\nescalate, it could seriously threaten national peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMy Government is, therefore, firmly committed to\r\nan early resolution of the conflict. The engagement of the\r\nCommonwealth special envoy is a preventive measure to\r\nbring about reconciliation between the parties concerned.\r\nI wish to acknowledge the assistance of the\r\nCommonwealth Secretariat in this regard. Three\r\nagreements to settle the crisis have been reached. We are\r\nworking very hard to ensure their implementation.\r\nI am also grateful for the prompt response of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General to my request for a\r\nUnited Nations mission to assess the humanitarian aspects\r\nof the crisis. My Government is committed to working\r\nclosely with the appropriate United Nations agencies to\r\nimplement the recommendations of that mission. We also\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nappreciate the humanitarian assistance of our development\r\npartners, including the Red Cross, to the displaced\r\npopulation. My Government is fully aware of the need to\r\npursue the necessary policies and programmes for nation-\r\nbuilding through the creation of long-term development\r\nstrategies that promote social cohesion and national unity.\r\nMy Government attaches great importance to regional\r\ncooperation, security and development. The political,\r\neconomic and environmental regional organizations in our\r\nregion, including the South Pacific Forum, the South\r\nPacific Environmental Programme, the Pacific Community,\r\nthe South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency and the South\r\nPacific Geoscience Commission, provide vital mechanisms\r\nfor policy advice and action on issues of regional concern\r\nand interest, especially in the areas of the environment,\r\npopulation, fisheries resources management and\r\nvulnerability index. The Solomon Islands has benefited\r\nfrom their contributions and thus will continue to support\r\nand actively participate in their activities. The thirtieth\r\nSouth Pacific Forum meeting, to be held in Palau next\r\nweek, provides an opportunity for us to discuss how best to\r\nstrengthen regional cooperation in order to effectively cope\r\nwith the challenges of the new millennium and to harness\r\nthe opportunities it will bring.\r\nFurthermore, my Government will continue to support\r\nthe efforts of the Government of Papua New Guinea to\r\nrebuild peace and confidence on Bougainville. We also note\r\nthe contributions of other South Pacific neighbours and of\r\nthe United Nations in this process.\r\nThe Solomon Islands further welcomes the progress\r\nmade in the last decade in the decolonization process in\r\nNew Caledonia. We reiterate our support for the aspirations\r\nof the Kanaks of New Caledonia to attain self-government\r\nand political independence. The process towards self-\r\ndetermination for other remaining non-self-governing\r\nterritories, including Guam and French Polynesia, must also\r\nbe facilitated. The United Nations is well placed to continue\r\nto facilitate this process.\r\nMy Government is concerned about the deterioration\r\nof law and order in East Timor following the referendum\r\non self-determination. The parties concerned must now\r\nhonour the outcome of the referendum. Violence must not\r\nbe used to deny the choice that was made by the\r\noverwhelming majority: the chance to move forward. The\r\nSolomon Islands appreciates the leading role of Australia\r\nand New Zealand in the international peacekeeping mission\r\nin East Timor.\r\nAt this juncture, let me renew the support of the\r\nSolomon Islands for the appeal of the 22 million people\r\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan to be represented in\r\nthe United Nations and its related organizations. Taiwan\r\nis capable of and willing to fulfil the obligations\r\ncontained in the Charter of the United Nations. Its\r\noutstanding economic success has enabled it to play a\r\npositive role in promoting world trade and in eradicating\r\npoverty. It has rendered development assistance, including\r\ntechnical training and technology transfer, to developing\r\ncountries, including my own. It has responded to United\r\nNations appeals for emergency relief and rehabilitation\r\nassistance to countries that have suffered from natural\r\ndisasters and wars.\r\nRegarding the accomplishments of the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan, are these not sufficient to merit\r\ndiplomatic recognition from the international community?\r\nTaiwan\u0027s membership in the United Nations system would\r\ncontribute substantially to the security and stability of the\r\nAsia-Pacific region and of the world in general. It would\r\nalso provide an effective basis for peaceful dialogue. The\r\nprocess of self-realization, supported by the United\r\nNations, has resulted in the membership of North and\r\nSouth Korea in the United Nations. The United Nations\r\nought to give similar consideration to the question of\r\nTaiwan. Ideally, the membership of the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan, together with the People\u0027s Republic of China,\r\nwill make a stronger United Nations. The Solomon\r\nIslands would welcome the opportunity to work through\r\nthe United Nations system to achieve a peaceful and just\r\nresolution.\r\nMy Government joins those who spoke before me in\r\nsupporting the call by the Secretary-General to accord\r\nhigh priority to preventive action to address the rise in\r\nlocal, national and regional conflicts. Are the current\r\nmechanisms available to the United Nations adequate to\r\neffectively resolve small-scale armed conflicts? Is there a\r\nrole for regional organizations to make a contribution to\r\nthis preventive approach? The reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should include consideration of a workable and\r\neffective preventive strategy. In addition, a\r\nreconfiguration of the United Nations regional groupings\r\nis necessary to reflect present-day realities and to\r\naccommodate the interests and concerns of Member\r\nStates.\r\nPerhaps the most profound challenge for the next\r\ncentury is how to deal with the imperatives of\r\nglobalization, that is, capitalizing on its positives and\r\nmitigating its negatives. In other words, the challenge of\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nglobalization in the new era is not to halt the expansion of\r\nglobal markets, but to find the rules and institutions for\r\nstronger governance to preserve the advantages of global\r\nmarkets and competition within a framework of cooperation\r\nto enhance human progress.\r\nOnly the United Nations and other international\r\ninstitutions have the scope and the legitimacy to generate\r\nthe principles, norms and rules that are essential if\r\nglobalization is to benefit everyone. Developing countries,\r\nin particular the least developed, need international support\r\nto build the capacities to enable us to become more\r\neffectively and beneficially integrated into the global\r\neconomy. Debt relief, new and additional resources for\r\ndevelopment and better diverse trade opportunities are\r\nrequired to facilitate this process.\r\nThe Millennium Assembly, to be held in September\r\n2000, affords a unique opportunity for all States to discuss\r\nand exchange views on how best to address the many\r\nchallenges facing us. My Government looks forward to\r\nparticipating actively in this important gathering. Equally\r\nimportant are the special session of the General Assembly\r\nto review the implementation of the outcome of the World\r\nSummit for Social Development and Further Initiatives: the\r\nreview of the Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women;\r\nand the Third United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, to be held in the year 2001.\r\nFinally, the United Nations needs adequate financial\r\nresources to achieve its objectives. The current financial\r\ndifficulties do not bode well for the Organization. Member\r\nStates must honour their Charter obligations and pay their\r\ndues in full, on time, and without conditions. Despite our\r\nown economic and financial constraints, my Government\r\nhas settled most of its arrears to the United Nations,\r\nincluding contributions to the regular budget for 1999 and\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nThis century has witnessed vast advances in transport\r\nand communications technology, the increase of global\r\ntrade and wealth and improvements in the area of\r\ninternational peace and security. New information and\r\ncommunications technologies have driven globalization.\r\nUnfortunately, these achievements, including the benefits\r\nand opportunities of globalization, have not been widely\r\nenjoyed and distributed. Global governance of globalization\r\nmust focus on human security, development, equity, ethics,\r\ninclusion and sustainability. Let us unite in the spirit of the\r\nnew millennium to build a better world to live in.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Bartholomew Ulufa’alu, Prime\r\nMinister of the Solomon Islands, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of the Niger\r\nThe President: The Assembly will next hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of the\r\nNiger.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of the Niger, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of the Niger, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, and inviting him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Mayaki (Niger) (spoke in French): I am\r\ndelighted to have the opportunity at this fifty-fourth\r\nsession of the General Assembly to share with the entire\r\ninternational community the concerns — but also the\r\nhope — that inspire the nation of Niger in the progress of\r\nworld events.\r\nThe Niger welcomes the new Member States — the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga — to membership of the United\r\nNations community.\r\nI would also like to say how proud and pleased we\r\nare, Sir, over your unanimous election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for this session. On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Niger, I wish to sincerely congratulate\r\nyou and the other members of the Bureau. Your\r\nprofessional skills and your well-known human qualities,\r\nas well as your unceasing commitment to your country,\r\nNamibia, and to the defence of the noble causes of\r\nhumanity, guarantee the successful outcome of the\r\nAssembly’s work.\r\nMy delegation also has the agreeable duty of paying\r\na well-deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti, for the excellent work done during his term of\r\noffice.\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nThe presence at your side of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan, whose devotion and constant desire to serve the\r\ncauses I have mentioned are well-established, reinforces our\r\nconviction that the outcome of this session will make it\r\npossible to lay a sound basis for the future of a world that\r\nis less unjust, more peaceful, more prosperous — and, in a\r\nword, more human.\r\nThe Niger is a landlocked, heavily indebted country\r\nwhich has for almost a decade suffered from chronic\r\ninstitutional instability. This situation has seriously\r\nundermined its people’s efforts to establish a viable\r\npolitical, economic and social environment. Since its\r\naccession to independence in August 1960 the Republic of\r\nthe Niger has experienced profound upheavals which have\r\naffected its progress towards the establishment of a\r\ndemocratic, harmonious and prosperous society.\r\nBut these upheavals, far from weakening the\r\ndemocratic ideal of our people, have strengthened its\r\nresolve to overcome these challenges. Strengthened by this\r\nconviction, the Council for National Reconciliation and the\r\nGovernment resulting from the events of 9 April 1999 have\r\nmade the strong commitment that the people of the Niger,\r\nat peace with itself and possessing stable and durable\r\ndemocratic institutions, will be able to meet the challenges\r\nof the third millennium.\r\nOn 18 July, in a referendum, the people of the Niger\r\nadopted the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, which will\r\nlead to the establishment of lasting democratic institutions.\r\nThe timetable decided on by our Independent National\r\nElectoral Commission sets the first round of presidential\r\nelections for 17 October. The second round will be held at\r\nthe same time as the general elections, on 24 November.\r\nThe investiture and assumption of office of the President-\r\nelect of the Republic will take place on 31 December 1999.\r\nIn this respect, every step has been taken to organize\r\nthe elections in the most transparent, honest and neutral\r\nway possible. The measures taken include a ban on the\r\nmilitary’s submitting candidates for the presidential and\r\ngeneral elections, even if those candidates are on leave of\r\nabsence or have resigned from the military. The\r\nGovernment will ensure that the elections are held in a\r\nspirit of impartiality.\r\nWith this same aim, the Independent National\r\nElectoral Commission was institutionalized and a national\r\ncommunications monitor set up to guarantee equal access\r\nto public media and to ensure that the press is free and\r\nconstructive.\r\nBasically, therefore, our political transition is on the\r\nright track, and the instruments for this transition will be\r\nactive until power is handed over to the duly, freely\r\nelected authorities.\r\nIn view of all this, we hope that our traditional\r\nexternal partners will help us establish true democracy in\r\nthe Niger. We expect their support, which is necessary to\r\nhelp us in the process of establishing dialogue among all\r\nparties concerned to guarantee the holding of credible,\r\nhonest elections.\r\nBut as the Assembly is aware, democracy does not\r\njust mean holding a series of elections. A legal arsenal\r\nand a different way of thinking are essential to\r\nconsolidate democracy, and this is why we have started\r\ngiving organized, concerted consideration to the drafting\r\nof basic texts that will govern the future Republic.\r\nVaried and burning issues, such as the\r\ndepoliticization of the administration, the electoral code,\r\nthe charter of political parties, the status of the opposition\r\nand the role of the army in a democratic context have\r\nbeen tackled.\r\nIn this context, I call upon interested States to take\r\npart in the national workshop to be held next December\r\non the theme “The army and democracy in Africa: the\r\ncase of the Niger”.\r\nI wish very sincerely to thank all bilateral and\r\nmultilateral partners of the Niger, in particular United\r\nNations agencies, and more specifically the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), for having\r\ncontinued to support my country’s efforts to create the\r\nright institutional environment to restore social peace and\r\nto enable men and women of the Niger to meet the major\r\nchallenges they face. This highly appreciated assistance\r\nwill continue to be necessary in this decisive phase of the\r\ndemocratic process and the process of national\r\nreconciliation.\r\nThe recurrent theme of post-conflict insecurity\r\ndeserves special attention from the United Nations\r\nsystem. The Niger, resolutely committed to the process of\r\ncantonment, disarmament and socio-economic\r\nreintegration of elements of the former rebel army which\r\nrampaged in the north and far east of the country a few\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nyears ago, fully supports the programme for collecting and\r\ndestroying small arms.\r\nIt is in this spirit that my country submitted to the\r\nSecretariat a plan to put an end to the illicit circulation of\r\nsmall arms and light weapons. It endorsed the decision\r\ntaken by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in June\r\n1998 and the declaration adopted by the heads of State and\r\nGovernment of member countries of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in October\r\n1998 to deal with the destabilizing effects and the threat to\r\npeace and security posed by the illicit circulation of small\r\narms and light weapons for the West African region and for\r\nthe entire continent.\r\nWe welcome the emerging concordance of views and\r\naction regarding the priority nature of this question among\r\nAfrican organizations on the one hand, and other\r\ninternational institutions — including those of the United\r\nNations system, the European Union and the Organization\r\nof American States — on the other. This international\r\nconsensus will make it possible to take effective steps in\r\ntime for the upcoming international conference on all\r\naspects of the illicit arms trade, to be held in 2001.\r\nThe Niger has always sought to make its modest\r\ncontribution to the settlement of conflicts that threaten\r\npeace and security in Africa and throughout the rest of the\r\nworld. Despite our limited resources, we sent troops to\r\nLiberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, as well as civilian\r\npolice officers to Haiti. In this regard, my Government\r\nwishes to reaffirm its constant willingness to send military\r\nand police contingents to all United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations when needed.\r\nIn Africa, thanks to the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity, we have reason to hope that the process\r\nleading to the referendum on self-determination for the\r\nSahraoui people will soon lead to a final settlement of this\r\nquestion.\r\nThe conclusion of the Peace Agreement in Sierra\r\nLeone under the aegis of ECOWAS and the Ceasefire\r\nAgreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have\r\ngiven us a glimmer of hope. These efforts must be\r\ncontinued and must serve as an example for those involved\r\nin other conflicts, such as in Angola, in Somalia or in the\r\narmed confrontation between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\r\nIt must be acknowledged that these situations of crisis\r\nand insecurity demand first and foremost that African\r\nGovernments and leaders of public opinion commit\r\nthemselves resolutely to dealing with factors of instability\r\non a consensus basis. In this respect, my Government and\r\nmy people would like through me to welcome the\r\nindividual and collective initiatives to create or\r\nconsolidate an environment of peace and security in\r\nAfrica, which is a sine qua non for development.\r\nOutstanding and effective initiatives have been taken\r\nin various places and should be welcomed. Among these\r\nis the action initiated by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika\r\nof Algeria, who had the praiseworthy idea of holding on\r\n16 September last, a referendum on civil concord, which\r\nwas massively supported by the Algerian people. The\r\nGovernment and the people of the Niger welcome this\r\ngenuine plebiscite and the prospects it ushers in for that\r\nfraternal country.\r\nThe Niger also welcomes the positive developments\r\nin the Lockerbie case. We believe that conditions now\r\nexist for the total lifting of sanctions against the great\r\nSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nIn the Middle East, the attention of the international\r\ncommunity is still focused on the Israeli-Palestinian peace\r\nprocess, which, fortunately, seems to have been revived\r\nwith the change in the leadership of the Israeli\r\nGovernment.\r\nIn Asia, the Jammu and Kashmir conflict remains a\r\nsource of great tension between two nuclear States, India\r\nand Pakistan, and a persistent, serious threat to peace and\r\nsecurity in that part of South Asia.\r\nThe Niger, therefore, as a member of the contact\r\ngroup established by the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, reiterates its appeal to both parties to step up\r\ntheir negotiations in order to reach a peaceful settlement\r\nof the conflict by recognizing the Kashmiri people’s right\r\nto self-determination pursuant to the relevant resolutions\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn Europe, my Government welcomes the return of\r\npeace to the Balkans. The establishment of an\r\nadministration under United Nations control is a sure\r\nguarantee for the safe return of the refugees.\r\nIt is more essential and urgent than ever to reverse\r\nthe decline in official development assistance which, it\r\nmust be recalled, is at its lowest level in 50 years. In\r\norder to meet this challenge, the international community\r\nmust consider the possibility of mobilizing additional\r\nresources. It is therefore urgent that progress be made\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nwithin the framework of the initiatives taken at world\r\nsummits. At the same time, we must pool our efforts to\r\nincrease the effectiveness of aid by reviewing its modalities\r\nand through its sound and rigorous management.\r\nIt is on the basis of this experience that my\r\nGovernment adopted a national strategy note and an\r\neconomic recovery programme that clearly defines the\r\ncoherent networks for action by our development partners.\r\nFurthermore, the crucial problem of African countries’\r\ndebt — which is wiping out all development efforts —\r\ncalls for the international community as a whole to\r\nimplement, without delay or conditions other than good\r\npublic administration, appropriate regulatory policies and\r\nmechanisms.\r\nIn this connection, the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative of the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as the recent\r\ninitiative undertaken in Cologne at the Group of 7 Summit,\r\nmust be extended to all the least developed countries in\r\norder to produce the effects we hope to see. This must take\r\nthe form of an outright cancellation of the debt.\r\nDespite the outstanding efforts made by many African\r\ncountries in the area of economic reform, foreign private\r\ninvestment flows are still meagre, notwithstanding the\r\nenabling environment that has been established. We very\r\nmuch hope that the positive initiative taken by the\r\nSecretary-General at Davos will allow greater involvement\r\nby the private sector in implementing adequate measures to\r\nreverse that tendency. It is in this connection that my\r\ndelegation would like to appeal to all development partners\r\nto help reinforce the institutional capacities of our States\r\nand to create adequate infrastructures, which are guarantees\r\nof balanced development.\r\nThe second special dialogue between the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions held\r\nhere on 29 April 1999 reaffirmed the need to continue the\r\nreform of the international financial system, bearing in\r\nmind social imperatives and the external debt situation, that\r\nis to say, the close link between settling debt, poverty\r\nreduction and lasting development.\r\nNiger belongs to the group of least developed\r\ncountries and has a population that is growing at an annual\r\nrate of 3.4 per cent. It has a fertility rate of 7.4 children per\r\nwoman and a life expectancy of 47 years, and is ranked\r\namong the poorest countries of the world. Despite all these\r\nconstraints, my country has made efforts to design and\r\nimplement initiatives in keeping with the\r\nrecommendations of the population conferences.\r\nThese various difficulties have exacerbated the\r\npolitical instability I referred to before and have kept our\r\ncountry at the bottom of the human development table.\r\nPoverty affects 63 per cent of our compatriots, 34 per\r\ncent of whom live below the extreme poverty threshold.\r\nThose people are victims of continued declining maternal,\r\nchildhood and adolescent health standards — a critical\r\nsocial and health situation marked by high mortality and\r\nilliteracy rates, one of the lowest standards of education\r\nand insufficient drinking water resources. They even lack\r\nbasic social services.\r\nThe economic and financial crisis that has hit my\r\ncountry has, among other things, led to a drastic reduction\r\nin public investment, particularly in the social sectors,\r\nthus depriving 80 per cent of the rural population of\r\nadequate living standards. With the valuable assistance of\r\ninternational financial institutions we have initiated an\r\nenormous economic recovery programme to confront this\r\nsituation. This programme includes, among other things,\r\na series of economic and financial reforms and framework\r\nprogrammes to restore the macroeconomic balance,\r\nreduce poverty and stimulate growth.\r\nI wish, from this rostrum, to reiterate our great\r\nappreciation for the ongoing support that the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and other development\r\npartners have been steadily providing to implement our\r\nnational framework programme to combat poverty. This\r\nprogramme we are implementing is one of the priorities\r\nof the first country cooperation framework adopted by the\r\nUNDP Governing Council last January.\r\nI would like here to make a heartfelt appeal to the\r\nUnited Nations system to allocate sufficient\r\nsupplementary resources to UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA\r\nso that they can complete their development activities in\r\nthe least developed countries. This appeal also goes out\r\nto the international community to supply all the necessary\r\nsupport to my country so that the major challenges we are\r\nconfronting can be met.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, special\r\nattention should be given to making a reality of the\r\nuniversality of our world Organization. Peace, security\r\nand development are too important to be the sole\r\nresponsibility of a club of military, economic and\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nfinancial Powers. Africa, which now figures prominently\r\namong international initiatives and hopes to become an\r\nactive partner in those initiatives, must play an important\r\nrole within a reformed Security Council. Africa has\r\ncountries that can play a decisive role in that regard.\r\nA large number of countries, including my own, that\r\nshare the use of French with other States of the world very\r\nmuch hope that they can work in all United Nations bodies\r\nand agencies in their official language. The member States\r\nof the Organisation international de la Francophonie, which\r\nis increasingly establishing itself as an essential actor in\r\nworld affairs, will make an additional contribution in the\r\ngive-and-take process in the third millennium.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the confidence\r\nthat Niger and its people have in the United Nations, which\r\nis trying very hard to be an institution that embodies hope\r\non the basis of justice, equity, peace, freedom and progress.\r\nThese values will build the coming twenty-first century we\r\nare expecting if the United Nations is stronger and more\r\neffective.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of the\r\nNiger for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of the Niger, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal.\r\nThe Right Honourable Krishna Prasad Bhattarai,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I take great pleasure in welcoming\r\nThe Right Honourable Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Nepal, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Bhattarai (Nepal): I bring to you, Mr. President,\r\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan and to all representatives\r\nthe greetings and best wishes of His Majesty King Birendra\r\nand of the Government and people of Nepal. Your election\r\nis testimony to the wide recognition of your great country\u0027s\r\ncontribution to the cause of freedom of the peoples and to\r\nthe work of the United Nations. Please accept our\r\ncongratulations and pledge of support. Our appreciation\r\ngoes also to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the\r\nwise manner in which he conducted the business of the\r\nfifty-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe massive loss of life and property and the untold\r\nsuffering caused by the recent earthquakes to the peoples\r\nof Turkey, Greece and Taiwan have touched the hearts of\r\nthe Nepalese people. Indeed, our hearts go out to the\r\nhundreds of thousands of peoples across the globe who\r\nhave suffered from both natural and man-made disasters.\r\nNepal wholeheartedly welcomes Kiribati, Nauru and\r\nTonga as new Members of the United Nations. Their\r\nadmission has enriched the world Organization and\r\nenhanced its universality.\r\nFollowing the restoration of the multi-party political\r\nsystem in Nepal, I had the unique privilege of steering the\r\ncountry at a turning point of history as its Prime Minister,\r\nentrusted with the twin responsibilities of overseeing the\r\nformulation of a new democratic constitution of the\r\nKingdom and the holding of free, fair and peaceful\r\ngeneral elections at the beginning of the last decade of\r\nthis century. With the people\u0027s trust and guidance, the\r\ncooperation of all political parties and the support of His\r\nMajesty the King, and above all with God\u0027s will, those\r\nresponsibilities were fully discharged.\r\nThe Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal not only\r\nguarantees the fundamental human rights of the people\r\nbut also the independence of the judiciary. It defines and\r\nprotects the basic tenets of parliamentary democracy in\r\nNepal, and it identifies the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations as the fundamental plank of\r\nthe foreign policy of the country. Standing today before\r\nthis Assembly of nations, I wish to reaffirm Nepal\u0027s\r\ncommitment to the principles and objectives of the United\r\nNations and to share, in brief, our hopes, aspirations and\r\nviews.\r\nLast year we observed the fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, a milestone in\r\nhuman history. The fiftieth anniversary of another\r\nhistorical milestone — the Geneva Conventions of\r\n1949 — this year provides the international community\r\nwith another opportunity to reiterate its deepening\r\ncommitment to democracy, human rights and improved\r\nliving conditions for peoples. At the national level, we\r\nregard the protection and promotion of human rights as a\r\nsine qua non for the all-round development of the people.\r\nDemocracy and development, I believe, are two sides of\r\nthe same coin, hard to guarantee and secure except in a\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nstate of peace and stability under a system of participatory\r\ngood governance.\r\nNepal is a nation with a young democratic setup and\r\nan ever-deepening commitment to human rights and the all-\r\nround development of the people, who are beset with the\r\nnumerous unique and onerous challenges characteristic of\r\na small land-locked and least developed country with\r\ndifficult Himalayan and mountainous terrains and the\r\ngreatest of contemporary problems — poverty. At no point\r\nin history have we witnessed poverty eating up so\r\nsystematically the spiritual richness of peoples in many\r\ncountries, including Nepal — the land of the Buddha.\r\nNepal\u0027s development efforts are driven by an\r\noverriding objective of poverty eradication through\r\nemployment and income generation, social mobilization and\r\nthe strengthening of social capital within a democratic\r\nvalues-based system. The country has almost unlimited\r\npotential for hydropower development and tourism, and we\r\nhave created legislative conditions for the participation of\r\nforeign investors in these sectors as well as in other trade\r\nand services-generating sectors in Nepal. Our commitment\r\nto sustainable development has been translated into several\r\nmeasures aimed at the preservation of the environment and\r\necological balance, including the earmarking of a large part\r\nof our land area for the development of wildlife parks and\r\nnature reserves. I want at this stage to reiterate our\r\ncommitment to the development of Lumbini — the\r\nbirthplace of the Buddha — as an enduring peace\r\nmonument, a holy shrine for pilgrimage and one of the\r\nworld\u0027s greatest cultural heritages.\r\nI am disheartened that despite several world summits,\r\nconferences and international commitments, absolute\r\npoverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and hopelessness should\r\nstill remain the lot of the bulk of the world\u0027s population.\r\nOne billion adults, the majority of them women, cannot\r\nread or write. Almost a billion people are underfed and\r\nmalnourished, and a similar number have no access to clean\r\nwater, shelter or health care. Many millions die before they\r\nreach the age of 40.\r\nEqually threatening is the ever-widening gap between\r\nthe haves and the have-nots. The conclusion of this year\u0027s\r\nHuman Development Report is the unbelievable polarization\r\nbetween peoples and countries, which the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) characterized as\r\ngrotesque and dangerous. The one fifth of the world\u0027s\r\npopulation in the highest-income countries commands 86\r\nper cent of world gross domestic product and 82 per cent\r\nof world export markets, while the bottom fifth, in the\r\npoorest countries has just 1 per cent of both categories.\r\nHow long can the world go on like this, with a small part\r\nof its people living in freedom and prosperity while the\r\nlarger segment is living in fetters under abject conditions,\r\nbefore calamity engulfs us all?\r\nA few years ago, at the request of the heads of State\r\nor Government of the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation, I undertook the task of chairing the\r\nIndependent South Asian Commission on Poverty\r\nAlleviation as part of a regional endeavour to work out\r\nregional strategies and programmes of action for the\r\neradication of poverty from South Asia. My own\r\nexperience as Chairman of that Commission leads me to\r\nthe inescapable conclusion that the goal of poverty\r\neradication requires, among other things, sustained\r\npolitical will and commitment of the highest order, an\r\nintegrated and coordinated approach and decisive national\r\nactions, with the participation of all, including grass-roots\r\norganizations and civil society, backed by enhanced\r\ninternational development cooperation.\r\nBut the fast-dwindling official development\r\nassistance flows and ever-increasing resource constraints\r\nof United Nations development agencies, such as the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, make our task\r\nof poverty eradication and development harder and harder\r\nwith each passing year. This is particularly true in the\r\ncase of least developed and landlocked countries such as\r\nNepal. While we deeply appreciate the help of our\r\ndevelopment partners, we urge developed countries, which\r\nare undoubtedly in a position to do so, to generously\r\nincrease the volume of their official development\r\nassistance so as to attain the target set by this Assembly.\r\nReallocation of official development assistance in favour\r\nof the less developed countries is another area which\r\ndeserves attention.\r\nAs we are a democratic nation, women — who\r\nmake up half of every country\u0027s population — are the\r\nbackbone of Nepalese society. We can hardly remain\r\noblivious to the urgent need for their empowerment and\r\nadvancement. We have made legislative arrangements to\r\nguarantee their participation in the national polity by\r\nreserving exclusively for them as many as 40,000 seats in\r\nthe local elected bodies. In the three general elections\r\nsince 1991, the number of women parliamentarians has\r\nsteadily gone up. But we are aiming for more. Their\r\nliteracy rate is also improving. The Committee on the\r\nElimination of Discrimination against Women, to which\r\nNepal recently presented its country report, has\r\nacknowledged the progress made in raising the status of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nwomen in general and in increasing understanding of\r\ngender issues and the human rights of women among the\r\nNepalese population. We know we have to do a lot more,\r\nand I am personally committed to this.\r\nWe are equally committed to the protection and\r\npromotion of the rights of the child as well as the rights\r\nand interests of other vulnerable and disadvantaged sections\r\nof society. In short, we have before us a large agenda for\r\nnation-building, for the consolidation of gains in democracy\r\nand human rights and for living up to our international\r\ncommitment to peace, cooperation and development in the\r\nworld. We are dealing with the agenda with a sense of\r\npurpose and commitment, although there are several\r\nobvious difficulties, including the economic, social,\r\nenvironmental and political problems created by 100,000\r\nrefugees from Bhutan. We seek the continued support and\r\nunderstanding of the international community in the\r\ncreation of an environment conducive to the resolution of\r\nthis problem through bilateral negotiations. We also seek its\r\nsupport for their sustenance until they are repatriated.\r\nI wish to place on record our appreciation of and\r\ngratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the world\u0027s\r\nforemost public servant, for his efforts and successes in\r\ndefusing tensions around the world and solving many\r\nseemingly intractable problems, such as those of Libya and\r\nthe popular consultation in East Timor. I am impressed with\r\nhis impassioned call for the transition from a culture of\r\nreaction to a culture of prevention in the United Nations.\r\nHe has drawn our attention to the benefits and risks\r\nprovided by globalization and to the need for strengthened\r\ninternational cooperation to offset the vulnerability of many\r\ncountries, particularly the least developed and landlocked\r\nones, and the marginalization of Africa.\r\nWe have noted his emphasis on the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security as the primary\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council. We thank him also\r\nfor his dedication to comprehensive United Nations reform\r\nand for his package of reform proposals. Reform is a\r\ncontinuing process. It will be neither meaningful nor\r\ncomplete unless we arrive at a ratifiable global consensus\r\non the functioning and composition of a reformed Security\r\nCouncil. The statement of the Foreign Ministers of the five\r\npermanent members that any attempt to restrict or curtail\r\ntheir veto rights would not be conducive to the reform\r\nprocess is a matter of deep disappointment. Nepal supports\r\nthe common position evolved at the Durban Summit of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement on the question of Security\r\nCouncil reform. We are also firm in our view that no\r\nreform measure should curtail the authority of the General\r\nAssembly, which is the nearest thing to a world\r\nparliament.\r\nThe United Nations cannot continue to function\r\neffectively without a fair and sound financial base.\r\nAssessed dues must be paid in full and on time.\r\nPeacekeeping is a unique and most useful instrument for\r\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Nepal has participated in United\r\nNations peacekeeping for over 40 years in all parts of the\r\nworld. Some 35,000 of our troops and 800 of our police\r\nhave served with many peacekeeping operations, 39\r\nhaving been martyred and several more wounded in the\r\nline of duty. It is the firm policy of Nepal not only to\r\nmaintain but also to increase our contribution to United\r\nNations peacekeeping.\r\nIt is disappointing that for three years in a row the\r\nprincipal United Nations forum for disarmament\r\nnegotiations, the Conference on Disarmament, has not\r\nbeen able to agree on an agenda of work. Some important\r\narms control and disarmament measures have been\r\nadopted without reference to the Conference on\r\nDisarmament. As host to the United Nations Regional\r\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the\r\nPacific, Nepal\u0027s commitment to general and complete\r\ndisarmament, including total nuclear disarmament,\r\nremains undiluted.\r\nIn the summer months of this year, South Asia\r\nwitnessed a flare-up between two of our close neighbours.\r\nDisquieting because it broke a peace that had lasted for\r\nnearly three decades, it also exposed the myth fostered in\r\na bygone era that countries possessing nuclear weapons\r\nwould not go to conventional war against each other. The\r\nrisk of an accidental nuclear war engulfing other countries\r\nwas magnified by the close proximity of the two\r\ncountries. Leaving aside the causes of that flare-up, I\r\nwould like to commend the Prime Ministers and the\r\nGovernments of the two countries for their restraint, good\r\nsense and wisdom in containing the conflict and\r\ndisplaying a high degree of responsibility to their peoples,\r\nto the rest of South Asia and to the peoples of the entire\r\nworld. May I take this opportunity once again to appeal\r\nto the Prime Ministers of those two countries to resume\r\ntheir dialogue, begun in Lahore last February.\r\nNepal welcomes the Sharm el-Sheikh accord\r\nbetween Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat as an\r\nirreversible step forward in the Middle East peace\r\nprocess. It opens the way to a just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive peace. We hope, for the sake of peace,\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nthat negotiations between Syria and Israel and Lebanon will\r\nsoon resume in accordance with relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions.\r\nLet me conclude with a brief mention of the South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),\r\nwhich consists of the seven countries of the region,\r\nrepresenting one fifth of humanity. We are united in a\r\ncommon effort to enhance the quality of life of all our\r\npeoples. I am looking forward to hosting the next summit\r\nmeeting of heads of State or Government of the South\r\nAsian region in two months\u0027 time at Kathmandu. Our\r\nimportant agenda will deal with such issues as free trade\r\nand a SAARC social charter. We will also be signing a\r\nregional convention on combatting the crime of trafficking\r\nin women and children. This will be another landmark in\r\nthe work of SAARC, a regional association dedicated to\r\npeace and cooperation in South Asia.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly I\r\nwish to thank the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal\r\nfor his statement.\r\nThe Right Honourable Krishna Prasad Bhattarai,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I call next on the Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, His Excellency\r\nMr. Abuzed Omar Dorda.\r\nMr. Dorda (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I would like at the outset, Sir, to express the warm\r\ncongratulations of my delegation and of my country on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly.\r\nYou are one of sisterly Namibia\u0027s freedom fighters, and one\r\nof Africa\u0027s faithful sons. Your unanimous election to your\r\nimportant post and your country\u0027s simultaneous membership\r\nof the Security Council are strong evidence of the respect\r\nand appreciation that Namibia enjoys in the eyes of the\r\nentire international community. In the Security Council,\r\nNamibia\u0027s notable positions on important international\r\nissues also irrefutably demonstrate Namibia\u0027s unremitting\r\nstruggle for freedom, right, sovereignty and justice — a\r\nstruggle now waged by means different from those that\r\nNamibia used during its independence struggle.\r\nI also commend your predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, for his successful guidance of the\r\nprevious session.\r\nI wish also to welcome the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as new\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, deserves our deepest appreciation for his\r\ncontinued efforts to make this Organization freer and less\r\nsubmissive to the domination and control of the super-\r\nPowers of this critical historical era.\r\nOver the past several decades, the United Nations\r\nhas made considerable achievements, the most notable of\r\nwhich has perhaps been its role in the elimination of\r\ndirect colonialism and in the attainment of independence\r\nby many countries which today occupy their proper place\r\nas States Members of this Organization.\r\nThe world has witnessed fundamental changes,\r\nwhich imperatively call for serious reform of the United\r\nNations and its basic structures, so that the Organization\r\ncan truly perform its role as an umbrella, a haven and a\r\nreference-point for all. Colonialist soldiers have left the\r\nharbours and the airports, but with the collapse of\r\ninternational equilibrium, colonialists are reappearing in\r\nnew guises, with new means and with both new and old\r\napproaches. Colonialism is coming back in the guise of\r\nthe International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, other\r\nfinancial institutions, economic cartels, and, when\r\nnecessary, military alliances. It is coming back in the\r\nguise of international conventions imposed through so-\r\ncalled international legitimacy, which is really nothing\r\nmore than an expression of higher policies dictated\r\nthrough temptation or coercion. Colonialism is coming\r\nback in the guise of globalization, which is but a means\r\nof ensuring and consolidating dependence in terms of the\r\neconomy, politics, culture and even social values.\r\nColonialism is also returning through direct armed\r\ninvasion, when necessary, as we have recently witnessed.\r\nIt is also returning through bilateral sanctions policies\r\nenforced through so-called international legitimacy and\r\nthrough selective disarmament or rearmament.\r\nColonialism is returning through the elimination — not\r\nthe mere violation — of State sovereignty. The slogan\r\nthat is now much in vogue, “humanitarian intervention”,\r\nwill help erode the little that remains of State sovereignty.\r\nThat pretext has been completely exposed. If the new\r\nColonialists understood the real meaning of humanity,\r\nthey would not be producing and stockpiling all kinds of\r\nweapons of mass destruction or committing aggression\r\nagainst others. Nor would they be imposing sanctions on\r\ncountries, as they continue to do, with the aim of\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nhumiliating, starving and killing their peoples. We declare\r\nour absolute rejection of intervention under any slogan.\r\nThis is the world following the collapse of\r\ninternational equilibrium: the strong and the rich are\r\nbecoming stronger and richer, and the weak and the poor\r\nare becoming weaker, poorer and more deprived.\r\nIn the face of these fundamental changes, it has\r\nbecome necessary, indeed urgently imperative, that the\r\nUnited Nations should undergo a transformation that would\r\nenable it to respond to its new tasks as an umbrella, a\r\nhaven and a reference-point for all. This change will not\r\nhappen by itself, nor will the powerful initiate it. The\r\nweaker nations can only resort to uniting their limitless\r\nefforts, strengths and potentials to bring about and impose\r\nsuch change. My country believes that this desired change\r\nmust achieve the following:\r\nFirst, the authority for decision-making in the United\r\nNations must rest with the General Assembly, where\r\nMember States enjoy equal sovereignty.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council must become an\r\nexecutive instrument or authority for the General Assembly.\r\nThirdly, there must be a radical revision of Security\r\nCouncil membership that will be equitable to all under-\r\nrepresented regions, particularly in the southern hemisphere:\r\nAfrica, Asia and South America.\r\nFourthly, the Security Council\u0027s rules of procedures\r\nmust be issued by the General Assembly, which represents\r\nthe international community. Otherwise, it will be\r\nmeaningless to say that the Security Council works on\r\nbehalf of the international community. Quite simply put, the\r\nmajority of the members of the international community did\r\nnot participate in the formulation of the Charter. A very\r\nsmall number of the United Nations Members formulated\r\nit over half a century ago.\r\nFifthly, all privileges resulting from the victories and\r\ndefeats of World War II must be abolished, particularly the\r\nprivilege of veto, and any other privileges that prevent this\r\nmost important international Organization from becoming\r\ntruly democratic.\r\nDespite the crises, conflicts and wars that ravage the\r\nAfrican continent, this year has witnessed solutions for\r\nsome of them, prospects for several others and initiatives\r\nfor the solution of the remaining conflicts. As we express\r\nour satisfaction with this trend, we wish to recall, as we\r\nhave always done, that African wars and conflicts are the\r\nproduct of the division of Africa by the colonial Powers,\r\nwhich must assume full responsibility for all the damages\r\ninflicted upon the continent, including an apology and full\r\ncompensation to its peoples. The solutions reached for\r\nmany African conflicts were a result of the enormous\r\nefforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nsubregional organizations, several African States and\r\nsome African leaders who truly care about Africa\u0027s\r\nsecurity, stability and development.\r\nLibya has effectively supported and participated in\r\nthese initiatives, and will continue to do so, in close\r\ncooperation with the OAU, all other concerned countries\r\nand the Secretary-General of the United Nations. As a\r\ncontribution to the efforts made to tackle the situation in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes\r\nregion, Libya has succeeded in convening a number of\r\nmeetings, for heads of State of the region, in Sirte, Libya,\r\nwhere they reached the Sirte Agreement, later completed\r\nand signed in Lusaka, which is aimed at putting an end to\r\nthe conflict in the area.\r\nIn Somalia, Libya continues its efforts, in\r\ncoordination with all concerned countries and groups in\r\nconflict, for national reconciliation in that forgotten\r\ncountry. We hope that these efforts will result in the\r\nreunification and stability of Somalia. Libya has also\r\ncontributed to bringing peace to Sierra Leone and stability\r\nto Guinea-Bissau, as well as contributing to the efforts\r\nundertaken by the OAU to put an end to the dispute\r\nbetween brothers in Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the Horn of\r\nAfrica. A Libyan envoy was sent there to help end the\r\nwar and bring peace to those two brotherly countries.\r\nAfrica\u0027s plights are not confined to wars and\r\nconflicts, but also include several economic and social\r\nproblems: 44 per cent of Africans live in abject poverty;\r\nAIDS threatens the entire African population; malaria and\r\nother epidemic diseases still threaten the lives of millions\r\nin Africa. In respect of the latter, my country calls for the\r\nspeedy adoption and implementation of an international\r\nplan to eradicate these diseases in Africa before it\r\nbecomes impossible to contain and eliminate them.\r\nAttempts by African states to confront and solve these\r\nproblems are hampered by the heavy debts of the\r\ncontinent, which reached $350 billion in 1998, equalling\r\n300 per cent of the value of African exports and services.\r\nThe time has come to cancel African debts and to deal\r\nwith this question on the basis of new and equitable\r\nprinciples.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nIn order to confront these challenges and to usher a\r\nstrong and united Africa into the new century, our brother\r\nColonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi extended an invitation to his\r\nbrothers, the leaders of Africa, to convene an extraordinary\r\nsummit in Sirte, Libya, from 8 to 9 September 1999. Their\r\npositive response had been unprecedented since the\r\nestablishment of the OAU. They all participated in the\r\nsummit, with the exception of Somalia, which has no\r\ncentral government. Thirty-nine heads of State and four\r\nPrime Ministers were at the forefront of the participants.\r\nSome of the founding fathers of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity were also at the summit, as well as former\r\nOAU Secretaries-General. The summit, which is a historic\r\nevent in its own right, concluded with the adoption of the\r\nSirte Declaration establishing an African Union and its\r\npolitical, economic and legislative institutions. Africa is\r\nnow determined, more than ever before, to surmount all the\r\nnegative aspects of its present realities and to move forward\r\ntowards its future, full of hopes and aspirations, counting\r\nbasically on its own resources, capabilities and the\r\nendeavours of its sons.\r\nThe Palestinian issue has not been settled yet, simply\r\nbecause the essence of the problem is being ignored:\r\nPalestine is still occupied. Its people are still scattered all\r\nover the globe as refugees, replaced by immigrants from all\r\nover the world. Unless an end is put to all this, and unless\r\nthe Palestinian people are given their right to return to their\r\nhomeland, neither peace nor security will be achieved in the\r\nArab East region. The occupation of the Syrian Golan\r\nHeights must also be totally ended, as well as the\r\noccupation of southern Lebanon, in implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978).\r\nWe demand the immediate lifting of sanctions imposed\r\non Iraq, and we emphasize the importance of preserving its\r\nunity and territorial integrity, respect for its sovereignty,\r\nnon-intervention in its internal affairs and ending the\r\nongoing military aggression against it.\r\nIn order for the world to live in peace and security, it\r\nmust be freed from the nuclear horror that threatens all\r\npeoples. Elimination of nuclear arsenals and all other\r\nweapons of mass destruction must have priority, and all\r\nefforts to achieve disarmament, at both regional and\r\ninternational levels, must be concentrated on realizing this\r\ngoal. Unless those who currently possess such weapons get\r\nrid of them, there will always be those who strive to\r\npossess them. Efforts aimed at the non-proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons will be futile unless the nuclear Powers\r\ntake practical steps that would demonstrate their serious\r\ncommitment to the undertakings they have made. These two\r\ntracks must move together or stop together. We have no\r\nother choice.\r\nThe Arab region is subject to the threat of nuclear\r\nweapons possessed by Tel Aviv. These weapons\r\nconstitute a permanent threat to the people of the region\r\nand to neighbouring areas, and unless these weapons are\r\neliminated, all efforts to prevent their proliferation in the\r\nregion will be unsuccessful.\r\nLibya is the southern Mediterranean country with the\r\nlongest coast. Therefore, we have a vital interest in\r\nmaking the Mediterranean a Sea of peace and cooperation\r\nfor the benefit of all peoples of this basin. This goal can\r\nbe achieved only if foreign military bases and fleets are\r\nremoved from the area, as they are a source of constant\r\ndanger to all Mediterranean peoples.\r\nSeveral countries, including my own, are still trying\r\nto overcome the thorny problem of landmines that were\r\nplanted in by the belligerent Powers during the World\r\nWars. These landmines have caused damage, losses and\r\ntragedies of untold magnitude, both human and material.\r\nVast areas of Libya are covered by millions of land mines\r\ndeployed by the Allies and the Axis Powers during the\r\nSecond World War. We hold those Powers responsible\r\nfor what they have inflicted upon our people as a result\r\nof these landmines, and we reiterate our demand that the\r\nStates responsible implement the resolutions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly adopted in this regard, through the\r\npayment of compensation to the affected countries and\r\npeoples and the removal of these landmines.\r\nThe revolution of 1969 allowed Libya to achieve its\r\ntrue and complete independence. By driving the foreign\r\nmilitary forces and bases from its soil, my country\r\nliberated its policies and decision-making capabilities. For\r\nthese reasons, Libya has since then been the target of\r\nongoing hostile media campaigns aimed at distorting our\r\npolicies and tarnishing our international image. Our\r\nsupport for and solidarity with liberation movements have\r\nbeen portrayed as support for terrorism. Our standing by\r\nthe side of the oppressed and the downtrodden and our\r\nassistance to help them liberate their countries and their\r\nresources and defend their own interests have been\r\nconsidered interference in the internal affairs of others.\r\nThere have also been clandestine campaigns that\r\nhave sought to assassinate political leaders, in particular\r\nthe leader of our revolution, Colonel Muammar\r\nAl-Qadhafi, who has been targeted several times. Both air\r\nforce and naval campaigns have targeted Libya’s\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nterritorial waters and the main cities of Tripoli and\r\nBenghazi. As a result, dozens of martyrs were killed and\r\nmany times as many were wounded — in addition to\r\nextensive loss of and damage to property. The main\r\nobjective of these raids was once again to murder our\r\nbrother Muammar Al-Qadhafi, whose home, office and tent\r\nwere destroyed during these raids.\r\nEconomic pressure has been used against Libya.\r\nUnilateral boycotts and embargoes were followed by\r\nbilateral and collective embargoes, then by the\r\ninternationalization of these embargoes after the Security\r\nCouncil had become hostage to the will of the powerful\r\nsince the collapse of the international balance of power.\r\nThis was particularly the case during the first years of the\r\n“era of frenzy”, as Mr. Kofi Annan called it in a report to\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nWhy and how was the international “boycott” — as\r\nopposed to international “sanctions” — imposed? I call it\r\na boycott and not sanctions because a sanction is a form of\r\npunishment for a definitively proven action, a punishment\r\ndecreed after a final sentence has been pronounced by a\r\ncompetent court that has the jurisdiction to condemn the\r\naction in question. But no proof or evidence was presented\r\nto the Security Council that Libya, or even the two Libyan\r\nsuspects, had actually committed any action that led to the\r\ncrash of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of\r\nLockerbie. Nevertheless, the sanctions resolutions were\r\nissued in the name of so-called international legitimacy, a\r\nlegitimacy that is both wrong and wronged. This is wrong\r\nbecause resolutions are adopted in the name of the Security\r\nCouncil; the Security Council is wronged because it is\r\nforced to issue resolutions under political and economic\r\npressures and threats. The relevant resolutions were adopted\r\non the basis of suspicions regarding just two Libyan\r\ncitizens — yet the sanctions targeted the entire population\r\nof Libya. This was a form of collective punishment against\r\nan entire people on the basis of a mere suspicion that had\r\nnot been fully investigated. This punishment was imposed\r\nwithout a trial and obviously without any conviction in a\r\ncourt of law. So much indeed for legitimacy. In fact, how\r\nlegitimate could this be during the years of frenzy?\r\nThe conclusions — or cinematic fantasies — regarding\r\nthe suspicions were refuted at the time. Malta conducted an\r\nofficial investigation, the findings of which demonstrated\r\nthat not one unaccompanied suitcase was loaded onto the\r\nflight from Malta to Frankfurt. For their part, the Frankfurt\r\nauthorities investigated the matter and reached the\r\nconclusion that not one unaccompanied suitcase had arrived\r\nat their airport from Malta, nor had left it for London.\r\nWhat then, is the origin or basis of this suspicion?\r\nI would like to briefly remind the Assembly that\r\nfrom the first moment that the accusation was broadcast\r\nby the media, and before the matter was even presented\r\nto the Security Council, Libya had done the following.\r\nFirst, we had requested the other party to provide the\r\njudiciary authorities in Libya with its findings so that\r\nthese authorities could commence their investigations\r\naccordingly. Alternatively, we proposed that that party\r\nsend investigators to Libya to participate in the\r\ninvestigation. We proposed sending Libyan judges to\r\nreview the case file. We also proposed that an\r\ninvestigation be conducted by a neutral party or parties,\r\nor by the United Nations. All these requests were refused.\r\nSecondly, we requested the application of article 14\r\nof the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of\r\nUnlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation or the\r\nassignment of this matter to the International Court of\r\nJustice. All these requests and proposals were also\r\nrefused.\r\nThen, on 27 February 1998, the International Court\r\nof Justice issued two rulings in favour of Libya,\r\nconfirming its jurisdiction over the case under the\r\nMontreal Convention. The Non-Aligned Movement — at\r\na meeting of its Foreign Ministers in Cartagena,\r\nColombia, from 18 to 20 May 1998 — made a\r\nrecommendation to the upcoming Non-Aligned Movement\r\nSummit in Durban, South Africa, that the sanctions\r\nimposed on Libya be lifted if the other party to the\r\ndispute did not agree to suspend the sanctions at the next\r\nreview of the Security Council, which had been set for\r\nJuly 1998. At the Organization of African Unity summit\r\nin Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, held on 10 June 1998,\r\nthat organization declared that its members would no\r\nlonger comply with the Security Council sanctions if the\r\nother party continued to reject any of the options\r\nproposed by international organizations to resolve the\r\nconflict. Faced with all these developments, the other\r\nparty had only two options left: either to accept a trial in\r\na third country, or for the international community to\r\nimmediately lift the sanctions without having recourse to\r\nthe Security Council. Such a situation would have\r\nthreatened the authority of the Security Council — or,\r\nmore accurately, it would have threatened the authority of\r\nthose who influence the Security Council — this latter\r\nbeing in the Council’s view — a much more serious\r\nmatter.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nA further legal complication was the possibility that\r\nthe General Assembly would be presented with a\r\nconstitutional dilemma, especially after the issuance of the\r\ntwo rulings of the International Court of Justice — the\r\nhighest judicial institution of the United Nations. It was the\r\nSecurity Council versus the International Court of Justice.\r\nWe could present the case to the General Assembly at any\r\ntime. The other party therefore had no option, and\r\nreluctantly, accepted, hoping to gain time. But then it\r\nreturned to its main objective vis-à-vis Libya. It declared its\r\nacceptance of a trial in a third country and presented, as\r\nalways, a badly written draft resolution to the Security\r\nCouncil, along with other draft resolutions imposed on the\r\nCouncil by means that are well known to all, especially to\r\nthe Council’s members.\r\nOnce again, most Security Council members supported\r\nLibya, and once again the international community\r\nreiterated its strong support for Libya in letters that\r\nreflected the will of the overwhelming majority of the\r\ninternational community. These letters are all official\r\ndocuments of the Security Council.\r\nBut in all fairness, and to state the truth, from which\r\nwe have never deviated, I will say that the Government of\r\nthe United Kingdom has reacted seriously to the Libyan\r\nproposal, expressing its willingness to refer the whole\r\nquestion to none other than a Scottish court sitting in the\r\nNetherlands. We state the truth in our own interest and in\r\nthe interest of others.\r\nThe rest is well known to all delegations. On 5 April\r\n1999, the two suspects arrived of their own free will in the\r\nNetherlands, accompanied by Mr. Hans Corell, the\r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs.\r\nBut has the other party fulfilled its obligations? Has it\r\nshown respect for the resolutions of the Security Council?\r\nThe answer is no. In fact, the other party prevented the\r\nadoption of a resolution by the Security Council to suspend\r\nthe sanctions and agreed only to a press release. Once\r\nagain, under pressure from the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nmembers of the Security Council and from the other\r\nCouncil members, and after several letters were submitted\r\nby the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference and the Arab League to the Security\r\nCouncil and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\r\nthe other party accepted, unwillingly, the text of a\r\npresidential statement for the suspension of the embargo.\r\nThree months after the sanctions were suspended, on\r\n30 June 1999, the Secretary-General submitted a report to\r\nthe Security Council in document S/1999/726 pursuant to\r\nparagraph 16 of resolution 883 (1993) and paragraph 8 of\r\nresolution 1192 (1998), which requested him to report to\r\nthe Security Council within 90 days on compliance by the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya with the remaining provisions of\r\nresolutions 731 (1992) and 748 (1992). On 9 July 1999,\r\nthe Security Council considered the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nreport, but was unable to adopt a resolution that would\r\nhave lifted the sanctions imposed on Libya, because of\r\nthe intransigence of one State, the United States, which is\r\na party to the dispute. That State even threatened to use\r\nthe veto. This, in fact, can only be seen as reneging on\r\nprevious commitments made by the Security Council in\r\nparagraph 16 of its resolution 883 (1993) and paragraph\r\n8 of its resolution 1192 (1998). Moreover, it ignores the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report, whose contents lead to only\r\none conclusion: that Libya has fulfilled all its obligations\r\nunder Security Council resolutions.\r\nWhat justification, if any, does the United States\r\nhave for using the veto to prevent the Security Council\r\nfrom adopting a resolution to lift the unjust sanctions on\r\nLibya? First, the United States has reiterated the\r\naccusation it has made before and since the fabrication of\r\nthe Lockerbie case: that Libya supports terrorism. The\r\nUnited States has been repeating that allegation ever since\r\nwe evicted it from Libya\u0027s military bases and harbours,\r\nended its monopoly on our oil, and liberated our country\r\nfrom colonialism. That is why the United States still\r\naccuses us of terrorism. The Secretary-General\u0027s report\r\ncategorically refutes this claim. Members may refer to\r\nparagraphs 29 to 34 of the report and to other pages in\r\norder to ascertain the baseless nature of this accusation.\r\nMoreover, one can also cite reports issued by the\r\nAmerican State Department and statements made by\r\npresent and former officials of American Administrations\r\nthat all point to the fact that such claims can no longer be\r\nmade.\r\nLibya is a victim of American terrorism, not vice\r\nversa. It is the United States of America that committed\r\nall the acts of aggression that we have previously referred\r\nto. It is the United States that sheltered, financed, trained\r\nand armed terrorists and transported them to Libya to\r\ncommit acts of terrorism in 1984 and afterwards. Those\r\nwho continue to shelter terrorists wanted by other\r\ncountries are not in a position to refer to others by\r\ndescriptions that apply only to themselves. Libya has\r\nstood by liberation movements, particularly in Africa.\r\nThis is a legitimate cause, not support for terrorism.\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nThe second justification is that Libya has to cooperate\r\nwith the Scottish court in the Netherlands. This is\r\nmeaningless, since Libya has undertaken to cooperate with\r\nthe court, as the Secretary-General\u0027s report has shown.\r\nFurthermore, this matter has been discussed by the judiciary\r\nauthorities of the three countries in the presence of Mr.\r\nCorell. The Security Council, in paragraph 4 of its\r\nresolution 1192 (1998), decided that all States, not Libya\r\nalone, shall cooperate with the court. The text is available;\r\nwe can look it up if there is any doubt. Since all parties are\r\ncalled upon to cooperate, how can this argument be used to\r\nprevent the Security Council from acting in accordance with\r\nits obligations by lifting the embargo on Libya? This matter\r\nfalls under the competence of the International Court of\r\nJustice and the Scottish court, with which our judiciary\r\nauthorities are cooperating. It is blatant interference when\r\na member of the Security Council tries to influence the\r\nwork of these courts, which are independent institutions that\r\ndeserve the respect not only of Libya, but of all others as\r\nwell.\r\nThe third justification is even harder to swallow. It is\r\nthe demand that Libya compensate the families of the\r\nvictims. How can this be done when the court has yet to\r\nsit? It will not hold its first session until 4 February 2000\r\nand the laws state that the suspect is innocent until proven\r\nguilty. When we raised this issue, it was suggested that we\r\nsettle out of court. Why out of court? Why then is the court\r\nin the Netherlands? We were told that these are American\r\nlaws. American laws apply to United States citizens, not to\r\nLibyan citizens. The Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly reiterated last year and the year before that\r\nnational laws cannot be applied beyond national borders.\r\nThis logic of power should be used only to uphold the law.\r\nAt the joint meeting, the Secretary-General himself was\r\nsurprised to hear this proposal before the court was in\r\nsession. They reiterated it. He asked them how it could be\r\ndone. They said that the court would hand down a sentence.\r\nHe pointed out that it had not yet done so and that, if it did,\r\nLibya would be committed to respecting it. How could they\r\npossibly make such a request when the suspects have not\r\nbeen found guilty? We are trying to prove their innocence\r\nand our country\u0027s. How can we be asked to pay\r\ncompensation when a ruling has not yet been issued? This\r\nis yet another way of interfering in the internal affairs of\r\nthe Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.\r\nWho will compensate Libya for the damages it has\r\nsustained in excess of $70 billion after seven years of\r\nunjustified sanctions and embargoes? Who will compensate\r\nus? The United Nations? Will the Member States\r\ncompensate Libya for something they have not done? Let\r\nus be logical and work within the law on the basic\r\nprinciples of justice. Since we have agreed to the\r\nestablishment of the court, let us allow the court to carry\r\nout its responsibilities.\r\nLibya\u0027s fulfilment of its obligations has also been\r\nunderlined in the Secretary-General\u0027s report, in the\r\ndecisions of the thirty-fifth African Summit held in\r\nAlgeria last July, in the decisions of the Arab League this\r\nSeptember and in the decisions of the Ministerial Council\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement a week ago. All these\r\ndecisions call for the immediate and complete lifting of\r\nthe sanctions. In this, they join the overwhelming majority\r\nof the international community.\r\nPreventing the Security Council from adopting an\r\noverdue resolution lifting sanctions that should not have\r\nbeen imposed in the first place will threaten the Council\u0027s\r\ncredibility and ability to honour its obligations. It will\r\nalso reinforce the Security Council\u0027s failure to act in\r\ncompliance with the will of the majority of the United\r\nNations Member States and in accordance with the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter, as\r\nstated in Article 24. The will of one State cannot\r\nrepresent the will of the entire international community.\r\nMy country requests one thing: that the Security\r\nCouncil speedily adopt a decision lifting all the sanctions\r\nimposed on Libya. We demand that the case not be\r\nallowed to be politicized after the matter has taken its\r\nlegal course. The case should be left entirely to the\r\nScottish court in the Netherlands, without any interference\r\nfrom any political entity, including the Security Council.\r\nIf the Security Council continues to be prevented from\r\nadopting such a decision, my country will take all\r\nnecessary steps to guarantee fairness, including raising a\r\nconstitutional dilemma between the highest and most\r\nimportant judiciary organ, the International Court of\r\nJustice, and the Security Council. We will raise it before\r\nthe General Assembly in order to have a decision taken.\r\nThe President: I call on the Deputy Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Yemen, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdul-Qader Ba-Jammal.\r\nMr. Ba-Jammal (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): I am\r\npleased to convey to you, Sir, the assurances of my\r\ngreatest esteem on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Yemen, I congratulate\r\nyou on your assumption of this high office. We are\r\ncertain that under your distinguished and capable\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nleadership the work of the General Assembly will be\r\ncrowned with success.\r\nThe democratic process in our world today is\r\nundergoing real expansion and is receiving the attention of\r\nall nations, whatever their creeds, races or regimes. It is\r\nfurther consolidated by being increasingly linked to human\r\nrights, in particular the rights to sustainable development,\r\nglobal knowledge, equality, justice, peace and stability.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen has linked itself in complete\r\nunity to the democratic process and has made it a\r\ncontinuous process towards comprehensive development.\r\nBoth State and society are tirelessly struggling to make\r\ndemocracy in our country a firm and established system,\r\nevolving daily in order to ultimately form an integral\r\nsystem for the conduct of political, social and economic\r\nlife.\r\nOn 23 September 1999, the Republic of Yemen, for\r\nthe first time in its history, held free and direct elections for\r\nthe presidency of the Republic, reflecting the credibility of\r\nthe country’s political regime and its constitutional\r\ncommitments requiring the holding of direct elections for\r\nthe presidency for five-year terms. This is proof that\r\ndemocracy in Yemen has become established as a firmly\r\nrooted principle and a unique and unrestricted option for\r\nachieving a peaceful change of government respect for\r\nhuman rights, and for enhancing people’s role and\r\nparticipation in sustainable development and cultural\r\nprogress.\r\nDemocracy in Yemen appeared in its highest form in\r\nthe direct presidential elections, which reflected the free\r\nwill of the people and the need for development and\r\nstability. The results of the direct secret ballot showed\r\nparticipation in all parts of the country by 66 per cent of all\r\nregistered voters. The President-elect of the Republic of\r\nYemen for the forthcoming term, Ali Abdullah Saleh,\r\nobtained 96 per cent of the votes. A new term and a new\r\nera will begin on 3 October this year, when the directly\r\nelected President will take the constitutional oath before the\r\nYemeni Chamber of Deputies.\r\nMr. Ingólfsson (Iceland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe wish of the people to achieve democratic progress\r\nreflects their need for stability and for an end to states of\r\nemergency in their lives. This goes hand in hand with their\r\ndesire for a future that embodies radical change in the\r\neconomic, social and cultural fields. It also requires serious\r\npractical action on the part of Governments and\r\ninternational and regional organizations to support\r\ndevelopment in emerging democracies, and to supply\r\nthem with means of growth and the transfer of\r\nknow-how. Sustainable development would then\r\naccompany and safeguard democracy, and the linkage\r\nbetween development and democracy would be a\r\ncondition for progress and a motivating force for\r\ncooperation and human integration among all nations of\r\nthe world.\r\nSixteen States convened the Forum on Emerging\r\nDemocracies in Sana’a, the capital of Yemen, and issued\r\nan important instrument called the Sana’a Declaration,\r\nwith a view to intensifying the concepts, framework and\r\napplications of the democratic process in real life, and to\r\nachieving broad popular participation and the affirmation\r\nof human rights in those countries.\r\nI wish to reaffirm here the announcement of\r\nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh that the Republic of Yemen\r\nwould like to host the International Conference of New or\r\nRestored Democracies to be held in Asia in 2003.\r\nOur world today is witnessing profound changes that\r\nessentially represent the remnants of the cold war and that\r\nare, at the same time, new harbingers of hope that\r\nforthcoming changes will be in the interest of peace,\r\neconomic progress and development, and that the people,\r\npolitical leaders and intellectuals have absorbed the\r\nlessons to be derived from ideological and racial conflicts,\r\npower politics and their tragic clashes. The only way to\r\nprepare the way for peace and stability is through the\r\nlanguage of dialogue, the rule of law, stable relationships\r\nand the absence of fear, doubt and uncertainty. Dialogue\r\nwill for ever remain the only way to extinguish fires,\r\nspread the spirit of tolerance and coexistence and promote\r\nthe values of cooperation, solidarity and integration\r\namong all active forces and actors in the cause of peace.\r\nThe position of the Republic of Yemen regarding\r\nworld events consists of our commitment to the principles\r\nof peaceful coexistence, non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of other States, non-use or threat of force in the\r\nsettlement of disputes and peaceful negotiations and\r\ndialogue in the settlement of all issues, including border\r\nissues between States on a no-fault basis.\r\nAs a member of the international family and an\r\nactive participant in regional organizations, Yemen\r\nunequivocally affirms its sincere desire to contribute to\r\nthe maintenance of security and stability in the Arabian\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nPeninsula, the Gulf, the Red Sea, the Horn of Africa and\r\nthe Indian Ocean. The Republic of Yemen calls upon all\r\nStates and peoples to continue their sincere and diligent\r\nefforts to achieve tangible progress in the ongoing dialogue\r\nbetween all parties concerned in these regions. The desired\r\ngoal is to arrive at mutual understanding, balanced\r\nrelationships and firm bases for the achievement of\r\ncoexistence and harmony among States and peoples, the\r\nconsolidation of peace and the securing of the necessary\r\nconditions for development and cooperation.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen demonstrated in practice the\r\ncredibility of its positions of principle, its respect for\r\ninternational law, its wholehearted desire for stability and\r\npeace in the region and its awareness of the importance of\r\nsuch peace for international economic, commercial and\r\nmaritime relations. Yemen proved that when it accepted\r\nunconditionally the decision of the arbitration tribunal\r\nregarding the sovereignty dispute over the Yemeni island of\r\nGreater Hanish, which lies in the Red Sea between Yemen\r\nand the neighbouring State of Eritrea, thereby furnishing a\r\nprime example of how peaceful solutions to differences and\r\ndisputes between States can be achieved by international\r\narbitration.\r\nWe hope that the island-related dispute between the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will\r\nbe settled peacefully in accordance with internationally\r\nrecognized principles and rules relating to the settlement of\r\nsuch disputes, and in keeping with the desire to achieve\r\npeace, stability, development and cooperation in our region.\r\nIn accordance with these firm premises and guidelines,\r\nthe Republic of Yemen will remain faithful to the principle\r\nof the rejection of violence and the combating of terrorism\r\nin all its forms, whatever its motives and sources, and\r\nregardless of whether it involves individuals, groups or\r\nStates. Our country is combating this phenomenon with all\r\nits might. It believes that terrorism has become a worldwide\r\nphenomenon meriting investigation at the international level\r\nand the creation of integrated mechanisms and rules to\r\ncontain it and to counter its effects, with a view to\r\nultimately eliminating it.\r\nThe Assembly might agree with me that there is now\r\nan urgent need to review the policy of imposing\r\ninternational embargoes and sanctions. Experience has\r\ndemonstrated their ineffectiveness in achieving the goals\r\nand purposes for which they were adopted and the\r\ntremendous harm they have visited upon people, not\r\npolitical regimes, especially the middle and lower strata of\r\nthe population and vulnerable social sectors such as\r\nchildren, women and the elderly.\r\nThe situation in Iraq attests to this. The need for a\r\ntotal and final lifting of the sanctions imposed on the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya has also become self-evident,\r\nafter recent developments and the Libyan leadership’s\r\ncompliance with the Security Council resolutions\r\nconcerning the Lockerbie affair. We also call for the\r\nlifting of the sanctions imposed on the Sudan, which is\r\ncurrently holding an internal democratic dialogue for the\r\nachievement of unity and national concord.\r\nWars and clashes result only in human tragedies, in\r\nthe form of displacement, imprisonment, forcible\r\ndetention and flight from war zones in search of refuge\r\nand safe havens. In this context, my country emphasizes\r\nthe need to deal in a humane and civilized manner with\r\nthe question of prisoners, the missing and those who are\r\nforced into hiding as a result of wars, conflicts and\r\nclashes of all kinds.\r\nIn this regard, we have great hope that the issue of\r\nKuwaiti and other prisoners will meet with a humane and\r\nobjective solution that will help to create an atmosphere\r\nconducive to reconciliation and to the achievement of\r\nharmony, peace and stability in the region.\r\nIt is known that societies that host refugees fleeing\r\nfrom areas of war and oppression bear heavy burdens and\r\nsustain tragic consequences, and that their peoples face\r\nserious environmental and health hazards. Those societies\r\nalso face considerable economic and financial hardships\r\nas a result of hosting refugees. It is indeed regrettable that\r\nthe humanitarian work done for refugees by certain\r\ncountries should have disastrous, tragic results for those\r\ncountries. This is what is happening today in the Republic\r\nof Yemen as a result of the steadily increasing daily\r\ninflux of refugees from the Horn of Africa, which is\r\nablaze with regional and civil wars and local dissension.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to assume its responsibility with regard to this\r\nhumanitarian issue, which weighs heavily on the Yemeni\r\nState and society, by increased efforts on the part of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees and a more concerted international alliance\r\namong all donor countries able to provide emergency and\r\nlong-term assistance. Allowing the persistence of such\r\ninhumane phenomena and conditions reflects a tragic\r\ndeterioration in human rights and an alarming regression\r\nin the values of civilized nations. We undoubtedly need\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nto develop mechanisms and devise the necessary means for\r\ncoping with such situations. This is the very essence and\r\nsubstance of the work of the United Nations.\r\nAt the same time, we wish to emphasize that the time\r\nhas come for renewed solidarity and efforts on the part of\r\nthe United Nations, the international community and all\r\nparties concerned with a view to finding practical solutions\r\nto the situation in Somalia that will help restore the unity\r\nand territorial integrity of Somalia and bring security and\r\nstability to the region.\r\nThe peoples of the world seek a peace that is based on\r\njustice, equality, respect for human rights and the absence\r\nof tyranny, abuse and double standards. Accordingly, the\r\nRepublic of Yemen, which has supported and given its\r\nblessing to the efforts towards a peaceful settlement in the\r\nMiddle East, believes that a comprehensive, just and lasting\r\npeace must be based on the restoration of all legitimate\r\nrights to the Palestinian people, first and foremost of which\r\nis its right to establish its independent State on its national\r\nsoil, with Jerusalem as its capital, and likewise the\r\nrestoration of Israeli-occupied territories to the Syrian and\r\nthe Lebanese peoples.\r\nAt a time when we are positively and with renewed\r\noptimism discussing the peace process in the region, Israel\r\nmust realize that a just, comprehensive and lasting peace\r\nis a genuine goal for the people of the area. Furthermore,\r\nit is a regional, international humanitarian goal that will\r\nhelp open a new page in the life and relations between\r\npeoples and help end the tragedies of the past. It will\r\nhopefully assist in overcoming all rancour and grudges and\r\nin providing opportunities for tolerance between creeds,\r\ncultures and races. All this would constitute a genuine\r\nstarting point for stability, trust and mutual understanding\r\namong the States and peoples of the region.\r\nAs we approach the end of the second millennium, we\r\nare confronted with a reality exemplified in the increased\r\nspeed and movement of political, economic and social\r\nvariables, whose ramifications and relationship with other\r\ncontrasting factors are becoming increasingly more\r\ncomplex, in terms of time and space.\r\nWe are all therefore called upon to cooperate and to\r\nrespond responsibly for the creation of a healthy climate for\r\nthe building of a new world order based on justice, freedom\r\nof choice, tolerance and genuine partnership in all\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental activities at the\r\nregional and international levels. The ultimate goal is to\r\npermanently ensure a balance of interests and a sense of\r\ninvolvement in all that is humane and noble and, in\r\nconcrete terms, in a productive and useful life for all\r\nmankind.\r\nSince one of our primary goals is the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations and, in particular, the Security Council\r\nand the international institutions, we are giving this goal\r\nour full attention and support. At the same time, we\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for the initiatives and\r\nmeasures he has taken towards the goal of reforming the\r\nUnited Nations, its mechanisms and its methods of work,\r\nwhich would broaden democratic practices and achieve\r\ntransparency of work and effectiveness of participation.\r\nIn this context, we reaffirm our welcome and\r\nsupport for the Open-ended Working Group established\r\nfor this purpose. We call for the continuation and early\r\ncompletion of its work, taking into full account the\r\nimportance of a full understanding of the essential\r\nvariables in international relations in recent years.\r\nI reiterate my esteem for the President of the\r\nAssembly, and I thank all those participating in the\r\ncurrent session. May peace and God’s mercy and blessing\r\nbe upon you.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Trade of Saint\r\nLucia, His Excellency The Honourable George Odlum.\r\nMr. Odlum (Saint Lucia): As the curtain falls on\r\nthe twentieth century, this time-honoured institution, the\r\nUnited Nations, rejoices in the presence of two\r\ndistinguished Africans at the helm. The outstanding\r\nfreedom fighter of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab\r\noccupies our presidential perch, while our principled,\r\npurposeful and persuasive Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\r\nlike the proverbial Ol’ Man River, keeps rolling along,\r\nrelentlessly serene in his pursuit of world peace and\r\nhuman development. If Africa is the last impression of\r\nthe twentieth century, poetic justice demands that it must\r\nbe our first preoccupation in the twenty-first century. This\r\ninternational forum must readjust the balance over\r\ncenturies. We must pay for our dereliction of duty over\r\nRwanda and the Congo. We must remove the remaining\r\nvestige of apartheid, and we must make a quantum leap\r\nin eliminating poverty and disease by addressing the\r\ncauses of poverty.\r\nThe Caribbean has always leapt over the restrictions\r\nof size and resources to embrace the global vision of a\r\nliberated world, and the liberation of Africa plays a\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nseminal role in this process. Caribbean thinkers such as\r\nPadmore, C.L.R. James, Professor Arthur Lewis, Dr. Eric\r\nWilliams and Dr. Walter Rodney have all sought to\r\nsensitize the world to the catalytic role which Africa must\r\nplay in global development.\r\nWe recognize, however, that an essential condition for\r\nfulfilling this role must be the overcoming of the\r\nunderdevelopment that plagues that continent. But if we are\r\nto progress in that direction, we must first boldly admit that\r\ndisunity among the countries of Africa has much to do with\r\nthis condition. In an era when other geographic regions and\r\ncontinents have been uniting for economic advancement,\r\nthe African continent remains divided. The time has come,\r\ntherefore, for the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to\r\ngo further than just making declarations of unity. Pan-\r\nAfricanism must not continue to remain stunted, as it was\r\nat the threshold of the sixties. African leaders and statesmen\r\nmust show the resolve and the unwavering character of\r\nNelson Mandela, and give African children, born and\r\nunborn, hope in the future of Africa.\r\nIn this regard, the results of the recent Algiers summit\r\nof the OAU are therefore most welcome, for the summit\r\nhas demonstrated a new sense of urgency and commitment\r\non the part of the new leaders of Africa. The United\r\nNations must not fail to support this progressive\r\ndevelopment. For our part, Saint Lucia, mindful of the\r\nAfrican heritage of our people, will exhort our Caribbean\r\ncolleagues to consider applying for associate status with the\r\nOAU and to consolidate further our solidarity in the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) forum.\r\nOur call for unity is not being sent only to our\r\nbrothers in Africa. It goes out also to all developing\r\ncountries, be they in the Caribbean, Latin America, Asia or\r\nelsewhere. If we in the developing world are to have a\r\nbetter future in the new millennium, if we are to obtain any\r\nbenefits from the new international systems that are\r\nevolving around us, we cannot depend only on the goodwill\r\nof the countries of the developed world. There must be\r\nunity of action and purpose among us; there must be an end\r\nto the in-fighting, the skirmishes, and the wars between us.\r\nThe South-South Summit in Havana next year will provide\r\nan excellent opportunity for cementing solidarity on issues\r\nof common concern and deciding on a forward-looking\r\nagenda for the development of our people.\r\nIn the Commonwealth Caribbean, we the members of\r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) can be proud of\r\nthe 25-year integration movement in which we have been\r\nengaged. We are in the process of completing arrangements\r\nfor the creation of a single market and economy and for\r\nthe establishment of a Caribbean court of justice that will\r\nbe the final appellate court for CARICOM member\r\ncountries. But, certainly, we must recognize that while we\r\nhave made progress, we have not gone far enough. In\r\nOctober, the heads of Government of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity will meet in a special session in Trinidad and\r\nTobago to consider the future governance of the\r\nCaribbean Community. We urge the leaders of\r\nCARICOM, in what will be their final meeting of the\r\ncentury, to take decisions on the future of CARICOM that\r\nwill erase from the memories of West Indian people all\r\nthe hurt, all the pain, all the disappointments of our failed\r\nattempts at closer political union during this century. Let\r\nthe occasion for their October meeting be the springboard\r\nthat catapults West Indians into what will truly be a new\r\nera. Let our people enter the new millennium with a\r\nCARICOM that will be fully integrated, economically and\r\npolitically.\r\nWe can extend this tableau to embrace the Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories of our region. My Government was\r\npleased to have hosted, in May of this year, the annual\r\nUnited Nations seminar of the Special Committee on\r\nDecolonization to review the economic, political and\r\nconstitutional developments in the remaining small island\r\nNon-Self-Governing Territories. This highly successful\r\nseminar brought together representatives from\r\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations and\r\nexperts from the Caribbean and Pacific regions. This\r\nimportant activity resulted in the adoption by the Special\r\nCommittee of targeted recommendations in the\r\nfurtherance of the decolonization of these Territories. To\r\nthis end, we strongly support a second decade on\r\ndecolonization to focus on the socio-economic, political\r\nand constitutional development of the remaining small\r\nisland Territories, which are integral components of both\r\nthe Caribbean and the Pacific regions.\r\nBut the realization of these regional goals turns on\r\nthe full emergence of Cuba as a vital and creative force\r\nin the integration and development of the Caribbean. This\r\nemergence is frustrated by the inability of the United\r\nNations to harness the political will to remove the\r\ninhumane sanctions imposed by the United States on the\r\nCuban people, despite the successive overwhelming votes\r\nreligiously taken every year in the Assembly. At the fifty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly, 157 countries\r\nvoted in favour of resolution 53/4 to end the economic\r\nembargo against Cuba. The totally callous disregard for\r\nthe cumulative will of the Assembly is the touchstone\r\nwhich characterizes the relationship between the super-\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nPower leviathan and the 187 Lilliputian nations that talk\r\nand vote in this forum. Where is the democracy of which\r\nwe speak? Where is the mutual respect for sovereign\r\nnations? Where is the humanity?\r\nThe events in Rwanda, Kosovo and East Timor have\r\ndrawn serious lessons for the international community. The\r\nspectre of an effete United Nations looking on helplessly\r\nwhile Member nations intervene unilaterally is a nightmare\r\non the eve of the new millennium. It is for this reason that\r\nSaint Lucia strongly supports the call by Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for the United Nations to be empowered to\r\ntake action, whether militarily or otherwise, to stop crimes\r\nagainst humanity.\r\nSaint Lucia remains concerned at the systematic\r\nweakening and marginalization of the United Nations. In\r\nthis regard, attention is drawn to its operational activities\r\nand its development programmes, particularly the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP). We call on\r\ndonor countries to reconsider the effects of the budget cuts\r\non regional and country programmes.\r\nWe need a United Nations that not only carries out its\r\npeacekeeping and humanitarian capacities, but one that also\r\nplays a central role in the governance of globalization and\r\ntrade liberalization to ensure that globalization is about\r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur common humanity must demonstrate itself in our\r\nprompt response to natural disasters in each other\u0027s\r\ncountries. The people of Taiwan have been the most recent\r\nvictims of devastating earthquakes, which claimed the lives\r\nof thousands of innocent people. We commiserate with\r\nthem. It is at such critical moments that the spirit of\r\nbrotherhood must emerge. There was a surge of hope at the\r\nnews that the People\u0027s Republic of China had pledged\r\nassistance to the Taiwanese across the Taiwan Strait. Let us\r\nhope that the Creator is working in a mysterious way to\r\nbring about the peaceful and mutually agreeable\r\nreunification of the Chinese people on this occasion of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of China.\r\nOur own island State of Montserrat continues to\r\nstruggle to recover from the destruction caused by volcanic\r\neruptions. Yet the international community continues to\r\nexclude this small island from concessional assistance on\r\nthe basis of its high gross national product per capita,\r\ncalculated from its small population and inflows of\r\nassistance, mainly from the United Kingdom. The United\r\nNations, in particular the Committee for Development\r\nPolicy, must take the lead role in the revision of the criteria\r\nfor concessional assistance to include vulnerabilities and\r\nqualitative data including openness of the economy and\r\neconomic shocks. The sustainable development of small\r\ndeveloping countries will remain a dream unless these\r\nfundamental structural and systemic biases are addressed.\r\nSaint Lucia is particularly concerned about the\r\nexclusion of transnational corporations from the rules of\r\nengagement the World Trade Organization (WTO) sets\r\nfor trade, since a large percentage of the financing for our\r\ndevelopment comes from trade in one commodity. Saint\r\nLucia will continue to call for an integrated approach to\r\nthe consideration of trade and finance in the context of\r\nthe upcoming conference on financing for development\r\nand for the participation of all actors, including the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the WTO, under the\r\nleadership of the United Nations.\r\nThe dispute over the arrangements for the marketing\r\nof bananas has been particularly distasteful. People in\r\nmember countries of the European Union are being\r\npunished through sanctions by the United States for the\r\nsupport of their Governments for the banana marketing\r\nregime. That country continues to promote the interests of\r\nits multinational companies involved in the banana trade\r\nat the expense of smaller economies. There are at the\r\nmoment proposals on the table designed to put in place a\r\nnew WTO-compatible system for the marketing of\r\nbananas in Europe. All parties, particularly producing\r\ncountries, are of the view that a tariff rate quota system\r\nis the most viable regime for all concerned. A\r\ncontinuation of the tariff rate quota is essential for\r\nensuring that the market continues to generate adequate\r\nprices.\r\nYet the United States transnationals engaged in the\r\nindustry are instead promoting a simple or linear tariff\r\nmechanism that will have disastrous effects for Caribbean\r\nproducers. Saint Lucia and other ACP countries have\r\nexpressed dissatisfaction with this recommendation. We\r\nagain implore all European Union member States to\r\nrevisit this choice and to consider its implications for\r\nSaint Lucia and other ACP countries. We are inherently\r\nunequal trading partners, and the WTO should not subject\r\nsmall economies to liberalization and unbridled\r\ncompetition on an equal footing with economies and\r\ncorporations far more advanced than they are and expect\r\nthem to survive. Saint Lucia again calls on the\r\ninternational community, including the WTO, to\r\ndifferentiate between trading partners and promote fair\r\ntrade through special and differential treatment, not on a\r\nvoluntary basis, but as a contractual obligation.\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nSaint Lucia has been in the forefront of the fight for\r\nthe survival of small island States. To quote the words of\r\nthe President of the United States in his recent address to\r\nthe Assembly,\r\n“We must refuse to accept a future in which one part\r\nof humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new\r\neconomy, while the other lives at the knife edge of\r\nsurvival” (A/54/PV.6).\r\nGlobalization has left us on the knife edge of survival.\r\nWe are thankful to Europe for empathizing with our\r\nvulnerabilities, and we regret that they have attracted the\r\nwrath of sanctions for their pains. Between the rhetoric and\r\nthe reality lies the gaping wound of disillusion and despair.\r\nPresident Clinton rightly posed the question:\r\n“Will globalism bring shared prosperity, or will it\r\nmake the desperate of the world even more\r\ndesperate?” (supra).\r\nSaint Lucia can confidently attest to the truth that the\r\nsmall States and the developing world are desperate, and\r\nthat their desperation is compounded by the fact that the\r\nglobal preoccupation with money and markets is fast\r\ndestroying the values and sacred norms in our respective\r\ncountries.\r\n“Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey\r\nWhere wealth accumulates, and men decay”.\r\n(Oliver Goldsmith, The Deserted Village)\r\nThe decadence and moral turpitude that has taken over\r\nour paradise of an island is unbelievable. The conspiracy\r\nthat threatens to decimate our bananas has left us with\r\ntourism as a strategy for diversification. The twin monsters\r\nof drugs and crime promise to overrun us, and the filth that\r\nspews from cable television pours into our homes. Some of\r\nthese homes are nothing more than vile little hovels whose\r\ninhabitants are sustained at night by religion and\r\nunemployed by day. The decay is all-pervasive, and women\r\nfrom nearby territories are imported to ply their sordid trade\r\nin strip-tease joints.\r\nWe have lost our innocence; this is the surest legacy\r\nthat globalization has visited upon us. We cannot be\r\nswayed by the rhetoric of partnership when the relentless\r\nlogic of globalization is geared to decimate, to marginalize\r\nand to eliminate. The developing world must focus closely\r\non the Seattle Round and ensure that the wide sweep of\r\nliberalization and open markets does not wash us away. If\r\nthe dogmatism and inflexibility of powerful States threaten\r\nour survival, then we must band together in a “Trade\r\nUnion of the Poor” to seek justice and humanity. No\r\npoison is a necessary drink, and we cannot be expected to\r\nswallow globalization\u0027s cup of hemlock for the greater\r\nglory of the shapers of the new millennium. We want a\r\nnew millennium shaped by all Member States, addressing\r\nthe needs and interests of all, and beneficial to all.\r\nWe share our apprehension with this body. We will\r\nwork in the embrace of its wise Charter, but we would\r\ndescribe globalization in the words of the Irish poet\r\nWilliam Butler Yeats:\r\n“And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\r\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?”\r\n(The Second Coming)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nMinister for External Relations of the Sudan, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mustafa Osman Ismail.\r\nMr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me at\r\nthe outset to extend to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab the sincere\r\ncongratulations of my delegation on his election to the\r\npresidency of this session. We are confident that his well-\r\nknown experience and abilities will lead this session to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. We assure him of the full\r\ncooperation of our delegation to achieve that objective.\r\nWe also wish to express our appreciation to his\r\npredecessor for his valuable efforts, which led to the\r\nsuccess of the previous session. By the same token, our\r\nappreciation also goes to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, for his efforts at the helm\r\nof the Organization.\r\nI also wish to welcome our newest Members — the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga.\r\nMr. President, heeding your appeal to be very brief,\r\nI will not touch on all the points detailed in my statement\r\nbefore the Assembly, and I ask that the edited version be\r\nplaced on record.\r\nSince I last spoke before the Assembly one year ago,\r\nthe Sudan has witnessed numerous developments in the\r\npolitical, economic and social fields. A permanent\r\nconstitution was endorsed by an overwhelming majority\r\nof the people in a popular and free referendum. This\r\nconstitution guarantees for the Sudanese people all\r\npolitical and civil freedoms and rights, including the right\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nto form political parties and social and cultural\r\norganizations.\r\nDespite the difficulties faced by Sudan, as a result of\r\nboth the war and natural disasters, it has been able, through\r\nits own efforts, to restructure its economy to meet the\r\nrequirements of the free market. All this took place in the\r\nnear-total absence of foreign aid. The Sudan has also\r\nstarted to exploit its natural resources, both agricultural and\r\nmineral, in particular oil, which we started exporting on 30\r\nAugust last. Oil revenues will contribute to strengthening\r\nnational efforts for socio-economic development.\r\nIn the economic field, these endeavours have\r\ncontributed to reversing a number of the short-term\r\nnegative effects of the economic liberalization policies.\r\nThese reform measures have so far helped to achieve an 8\r\nper cent total growth rate and to reduce the rate of inflation\r\nto 13 per cent, and have led the International Monetary\r\nFund to commend this remarkable achievement. In order to\r\nalleviate the economic burdens resulting from economic\r\nreform policies, our Government has adopted a number of\r\nmeasures to assist the more vulnerable groups and low-\r\nincome citizens through social assistance funds, the\r\nprovision of “soft” loans and the establishment of small\r\nproductive projects for youth and women.\r\nIn the search for peace in southern Sudan, the\r\nGovernment accepted the Declaration of Principles as a\r\nbasis for its negotiations with the rebels within the\r\nframework of the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD). It also declared a partial ceasefire,\r\nas it had repeatedly done, in order to ensure the delivery of\r\nrelief assistance to its citizens affected by the war.\r\nSubsequently, we came to the conclusion that the most\r\neffective way to show our seriousness about arriving at a\r\ngenuine and lasting solution to this humanitarian tragedy\r\nwas to ensure the cessation of all hostilities. The\r\nGovernment therefore took its recent initiative to establish\r\na general and comprehensive ceasefire while continuing the\r\nnegotiations through IGAD, with the assistance of our\r\nIGAD partners. However, those efforts by my Government\r\nwere met by prevarication and were not taken seriously by\r\nthe other side. The failure of the rebel movement to accept\r\na comprehensive ceasefire is proof of its lack of interest\r\nand seriousness in searching for a solution to the problem,\r\nwhich has enriched its leaders at the expense of the\r\nSudanese people in general and of our southern citizens in\r\nparticular.\r\nThe Sudan looks forward to a more effective role by\r\nIGAD, the partners of IGAD and the Egyptian and Libyan\r\nconciliation initiative, in support of the peace efforts. The\r\ncall for a comprehensive ceasefire has also been endorsed\r\nby the United Nations and the international community.\r\nWe are grateful for and appreciate that support. Yet the\r\nprocess needs to be given further impetus and support if\r\nan environment conducive to the establishment of peace\r\nis to be created and all the obstacles in its way are to be\r\nremoved.\r\nIn this context, we call upon the international\r\ncommunity to take punitive measures against the rebel\r\nGarang similar to those taken against Savimbi in Angola,\r\nin order to persuade him to join the peace effort. We also\r\ncall for continued support for the Government initiative\r\naimed at achieving a comprehensive ceasefire, through\r\nbringing pressure to bear on the rebel movement to accept\r\nthat initiative and to show some seriousness in the\r\nnegotiations in order to find a solution to the problem.\r\nFurthermore, demands must continue to be made for the\r\nhanding over of the remains of the four relief workers\r\nmurdered by the movement last April.\r\nWith regard to the practices of the rebel movement,\r\nI should like to speak about developments in the\r\nhumanitarian situation, which continues to deteriorate in\r\nthe south of the country despite relative improvements in\r\nBahr el-Ghazal and other areas. From this rostrum, I\r\nwould like to express our thanks and appreciation to the\r\ncountries and organizations that continue to provide relief\r\nand humanitarian assistance to those affected in the\r\nSudan, whether directly or through Operation Lifeline\r\nSudan. We believe that there is a need for the gradual\r\ntransition from relief to development in the areas that\r\nenjoy stability, security and peace now that the Khartoum\r\npeace agreement and the Fashoda accord have been\r\nsigned.\r\nWe call upon the donor countries and organizations\r\nto make contributions to the consolidated appeal for the\r\nSudan for 1999, in view of the noticeable decline in its\r\nresources, which last June amounted to only 31 per cent\r\nof requirements. We also emphasize that it is important\r\nnot to allow political posturing to get in the way of\r\nhumanitarian and relief work. There is also a need to\r\navoid selectivity in dealing with humanitarian issues,\r\nwhich affect the lives of peoples and individuals.\r\nThe Sudan would like to inform the Assembly of its\r\nfull commitment to a general and comprehensive ceasefire\r\nthroughout southern Sudan for humanitarian reasons and\r\nas a means of paving the way for peace negotiations. We\r\nhope that the other party will respond positively so that\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nwe can begin to take practical steps to disengage the forces\r\nand monitor the ceasefire. The Government will allocate a\r\nlarge part of its oil revenues for humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment needs in the south. It will also allocate part of\r\nthis year\u0027s grain harvest for distribution by United Nations\r\nagencies to the needy population in the south. The war has\r\ncontinued for a long time, and we appreciate the role\r\nplayed by the international community in extending\r\nhumanitarian assistance. That situation cannot go on\r\nforever; the one and only solution to the crisis is a peaceful\r\none.\r\nThe conflicts in Africa have brought untold suffering\r\nand hardships, to the peoples of the continent. One of the\r\ngreatest problems is that of the more than 8 million\r\nrefugees who live under extremely difficult circumstances.\r\nIn its search to put an end to the suffering of the refugees\r\nand to find radical solutions to the problem, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) decided to convene\r\nthe first ministerial meeting of the committee on refugees\r\nand internally displaced persons. That important meeting\r\nwas held last December in Khartoum with the active\r\nparticipation of the sisterly African States, the relevant\r\nUnited Nations bodies, the regional organizations\r\nconcerned, the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\nand other non-governmental organizations. The meeting\r\nadopted the Khartoum Declaration, which contained an\r\nassessment of the problems facing refugees and displaced\r\npersons with a view to addressing the underlying causes of\r\nthese problems and to establishing favourable conditions for\r\nthe restoration of peace and stability in order to encourage\r\nthe voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons to their homes in safety and dignity. From this\r\nrostrum, we appeal to the international community and the\r\nrelevant organizations to continue to provide support for the\r\nStates affected by these problems so as to ensure the\r\nprompt and effective implementation of the Khartoum\r\nDeclaration and its recommendations with regard to\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons.\r\nWe call for the renunciation of selectivity in dealing\r\nwith the question of humanitarian assistance, human rights\r\nand democracy at the international level. We also appeal to\r\nStates to avoid politicizing these questions and using them\r\nas a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of others.\r\nWe are eager to see those lofty principles applied\r\neffectively while preserving the principle of the sovereignty,\r\nsecurity and territorial integrity of States. In this context,\r\nwe should like to draw attention to the cooperation of the\r\nGovernment of the Sudan with the United Nations in the\r\ndelivery of relief assistance to the affected population in the\r\nsouth, as well as to the recent visit of the United Nations\r\nmission to the Nuba Mountain region to assess the\r\nhumanitarian needs there.\r\nIn his report on the work of the Organization and his\r\nopening statement before this session, the\r\nSecretary-General reflected the international concern\r\nabout the expansion and intensification of civil wars and\r\nother conflicts in various regions and the human tragedies\r\nand physical and economic destruction that result from\r\nsuch wars. We share the Secretary-General\u0027s concern on\r\nthis matter. We reaffirm the importance of maximizing\r\ncollective efforts to eliminate the causes of conflicts\r\nbefore they erupt and of using all available means to put\r\nan end to them.\r\nWe believe, however, that any actions taken or\r\nmeans used must have the consent and agreement of the\r\nState concerned and must be within the framework of\r\ninternational laws and standards, particularly those of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. In the absence of a transparent,\r\ndemocratic and just international order, moving outside\r\nthat framework and calling for interference in the internal\r\naffairs of States will only lead to chaos and the hegemony\r\nof the powerful over the weak.\r\nPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the current Chairman\r\nof the OAU, summed up the fears and concerns of the\r\nsmall and weak States in this regard by saying that we\r\nremain very sensitive to any encroachment on our\r\nsovereignty, not only because it constitutes our last line\r\nof defence against the laws of an unjust world but\r\nbecause we do not participate effectively in the\r\ndecision-making process in the Security Council or in the\r\nmonitoring of the implementation of these decisions.\r\nModern history is full of examples of such unjust\r\ninterpretation and application of laws and resolutions. I\r\nwould like to highlight just one example: the unjust and\r\nunjustified attack by the United States on the al-Shifa\r\npharmaceutical factory and the inability of the Security\r\nCouncil to take a decision on Sudan\u0027s request to send a\r\nmission to investigate the American allegations\r\nconcerning the factory.\r\nThe ideas put forward by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis report require further consultations and consideration\r\nby the General Assembly and other United Nations\r\nbodies, with the participation of all Member States and\r\nwithin the framework of the Charter and international\r\nlaws and norms.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nUndoubtedly, the continued imbalance in international\r\nrelations has strengthened the trend towards unilateral\r\nsupremacy and double standards. This imbalance has had\r\nnegative effects on international peace, security and\r\nstability. It has also created an unhealthy atmosphere which\r\npromotes the interests of certain States while ignoring,\r\nindeed belittling, the interests and rights of the weaker\r\nmembers of the international community. Hence, the Sudan\r\nhas always supported the call for the establishment of a\r\nbalanced and diverse international order, an order that\r\nrespects the specific religious, historical and cultural\r\ncharacteristics of peoples and that protects their natural\r\nright to choose their own social, economic and political\r\nsystems in harmony with their cultural attributes.\r\nThe fact that the Sudan is being targeted by the United\r\nStates Administration is not open to question. Indeed, the\r\nUnited States Administration itself does not deny this. It\r\nhas taken many measures aimed at destabilizing Sudan and\r\nits security, and has pursued a declared policy of isolating\r\nthe Sudan through the provision of military assistance to\r\nsome of its neighbours. It has consistently voted against the\r\nSudan in the international financial institutions and has\r\nsponsored resolutions condemning and denouncing the\r\nSudan at the United Nations and its specialized agencies. It\r\nhas also attempted to smear the Sudan’s image in the\r\ninternational arena. It has made baseless accusations against\r\nthe Sudan, charging it with involvement in international\r\nterrorism and placing its name on its list of what it calls\r\nStates sponsoring terrorism. Furthermore, the United States\r\nAdministration imposed unilateral economic sanctions on\r\nthe Sudan despite the international community’s clear and\r\ndeclared position on such coercive economic measures. All\r\nthese actions have been taken by the United States on the\r\nbasis of totally false and unfounded allegations and\r\naccusations. The United States Administration has never\r\nbeen able to produce a single piece of evidence to prove its\r\nallegations.\r\nThe unjust United States actions and accusations\r\nagainst the Sudan culminated last year in the bombing and\r\ndestruction of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in\r\nKhartoum. A whole year has elapsed since I addressed the\r\nGeneral Assembly from this rostrum about the flagrant\r\naggression by the United States of America against that\r\nfactory, which was privately owned and financed by the\r\nbank of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern\r\nAfrica (COMESA). Has any action been taken since the\r\nSudan explained to the international community the\r\nenormity of the mistake perpetrated by the United States\r\nagainst the Sudanese people, depriving them of a main\r\nsource of medication for their innocent children and for the\r\nmany refugees and displaced persons that are given\r\nshelter by the Sudan? The Sudan continues to demand\r\nand to expect justice and redress from the Security\r\nCouncil as the organ with the primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nImmediately after the bombing of the factory last August,\r\nSudan requested the Security Council to send a mission\r\nto ascertain the facts regarding the factory’s ownership\r\nand output, and to verify the allegations invoked by the\r\nUnited States to attempt to justify its aggression. The\r\nnon-aligned countries, the Arab Group, the African Group\r\nand the members of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference all wrote letters to the Security Council\r\nsupporting the Sudan’s request. Most regrettably, the\r\nCouncil remained unable to act. The United States\r\nprevented the Council from discharging its most basic\r\nduty in this regard, namely to investigate the allegations\r\nthat the United States used to try to justify its armed\r\naggression.\r\nSince I addressed the Assembly last year, dozens of\r\narticles and reports have been published in major United\r\nStates newspapers. Numerous statements have been made\r\nby United States congressional officials and former\r\nCentral Intelligence Agency experts, along with a number\r\nof academic studies by specialized institutes in the United\r\nStates and other countries, all of which affirm that the Al-\r\nShifa factory was a pharmaceutical factory producing\r\nhuman and veterinary medicines. They also affirm that\r\nthe United States made a terrible mistake by destroying\r\nthat factory, which had links to the United Nations: the\r\nSecurity Council had authorized the factory to export\r\nmedicines to Iraq within the framework of the oil-for-food\r\nprogramme. The Sudan referred all these studies, articles\r\nand declarations to the Security Council. This year, the\r\nowner of the factory hired some of the best known United\r\nStates experts in the field of chemical weapons to\r\nexamine the factory and ascertain the truth about its\r\noutput. The experts took samples, which were examined\r\nin the most sophisticated and advanced laboratories in\r\nEurope and the United States. The conclusion was that the\r\nfactory produced nothing other than medications for\r\nhuman and veterinary use. The Sudan also formed its own\r\nspecialized scientific committee composed of university\r\nprofessors in the Sudan to examine the factory. The\r\ncommittee issued a report affirming once again that the\r\nUnited States allegations about the factory had no logical\r\nor scientific basis.\r\nA most important development then followed: a\r\ndecision by the United States Departments of Justice and\r\nof the Treasury to unfreeze the assets of the owner of the\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nfactory in the United States. That reaffirms that the\r\njustifications put forward by the United States for the\r\nbombing of the Al-Shifa factory were baseless. There is no\r\nphysical evidence to prove them. Rather, they were based\r\non misleading intelligence information. The United States\r\nallegations that the factory is owned by terrorist groups are\r\nalso baseless and lack any supporting evidence or proof.\r\nThe United States decision to unfreeze the assets of the\r\nfactory’s owner came after the United States Administration\r\nascertained that he had no connection with terrorism. This\r\nin itself is clear and irrefutable proof of what Sudan has\r\nbeen saying before the international community all along.\r\nWhen the matter was put before the Security Council\r\nlast year and when the Sudan requested the dispatch of a\r\nfact-finding mission, the United States objected on the\r\npretext that it would settle the question bilaterally with the\r\nSudan. A whole year has elapsed and all we have received\r\nis more procrastination. This led me last August to send\r\nanother letter to the President of the Security Council\r\nasking him again to dispatch a fact-finding mission. We\r\nappeal to the United Nations, as it represents all countries,\r\nbig and small, to prove its impartiality and objectivity; we\r\nappeal to the Security Council to send a mission to uncover\r\nthe facts about the destruction of the Al-Shifa\r\npharmaceutical factory. The United Nations should request\r\nthe United States not to object to the dispatch of such\r\nmission if it is confident of the information and the causes\r\nthat led it to bomb the factory.\r\nThe bombing of the pharmaceutical factory took the\r\nlives of a number of Sudanese. It deprived hundreds of\r\nworkers of their livelihood. It also deprived the Sudanese\r\npeople and the refugees from neighbouring countries of\r\ntheir main source of medication and vaccines. All this\r\nmakes the international community wonder about the\r\nsincerity of the United States commitment to human rights.\r\nIn their 1998 and 1999 ministerial declarations, the Group\r\nof 77 and China called for applying justice in this case in\r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter and\r\ninternational law. This act of aggression was a unilateral act\r\nunacceptable to the international community. The\r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries condemned this act at\r\nits Durban Summit and at subsequent ministerial meetings.\r\nPersisting in targeting the Sudan, the United States\r\nAdministration recently appointed a special envoy for the\r\nSudan with specific objectives and terms of reference.\r\nSudan was not party to the choice of that envoy or to the\r\ndefinition of the objectives and terms of reference of his\r\nmission.\r\nClearly, the way in which the United States\r\nAdministration chose this envoy reflects a condescending\r\nattitude and is an act of cultural arrogance inconsistent\r\nwith the spirit of the United Nations Charter, which\r\ngoverns relations between States. At the time when the\r\nUnited States claims to be concerned with the problems\r\nof the Sudan, we find that it has blocked, to a large\r\ndegree, all channels of bilateral contact. When announcing\r\nthe appointment of the special envoy, the United States\r\nspokesman affirmed that his mandate would not include\r\nthe bilateral aspect of relations between the two countries.\r\nHere we would like to pose a question: how could a State\r\nappoint an envoy to another State without having his task\r\ninclude their bilateral relations? This is indeed bizarre,\r\nsince the basic disagreements between us and the United\r\nStates are of a bilateral nature. Such disagreements led\r\nthe United States to use force to destroy a pharmaceutical\r\nfactory, and then it refused international arbitration in the\r\nmatter. It is also bizarre that the United States\r\nAdministration has given its envoy to the Sudan the task\r\nof dealing with the questions of relief, human rights and\r\npeace in the southern Sudan. I say this is bizarre because\r\nthese questions are dealt with either in the United Nations\r\nor at the regional level. The first question, relief, and the\r\nsecond, human rights, are dealt with in the relevant\r\norgans of the United Nations, respectively, the Office for\r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the\r\nCommission on Human Rights. The issue of peace in the\r\nsouthern Sudan is being dealt with at the regional level by\r\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD),\r\nwith the support of the Organization of African Unity, the\r\nUnited Nations and the group of IGAD partners, of which\r\nthe United States is a member. The Sudan will continue\r\nto follow closely the steps taken by the United States\r\nAdministration and will take the necessary measures to\r\nprotect its national interests. Here I would like to reaffirm\r\nthat the Government of the Sudan is willing to settle its\r\ndifferences with the United States of America through\r\ndialogue and the initiatives already taken in this regard,\r\nwith a view to breaking the stalemate. This interest\r\ncontinues even after the cruel American aggression\r\nagainst the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory. Yet this\r\ninterest of ours must be met with an objective response\r\nby the other party. Hence, we call upon the United\r\nNations and peace-loving countries to urge the United\r\nStates Administration to take positive steps towards the\r\nnormalization of relations with the Sudan and to desist\r\nfrom interference in its internal affairs, which only results\r\nin prolonging the civil war and death and suffering for the\r\nSudanese people.\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nThe Sudan believes that the United States, as a great\r\nPower concerned with world and regional peace, could play\r\nan important role in the settlement of the Sudan’s problems.\r\nBut for the United States to play that role, we demand that\r\nit show neutrality and desist from injustice and aggression.\r\nThe delegation of the Sudan is of the view that the\r\nMillennium Assembly, in which all world leaders will\r\nparticipate, is an important occasion for the United Nations\r\nto enhance its role and its neutrality. In this regard, we\r\npropose that the Millennium Summit declaration contain the\r\nfollowing: a reaffirmation of the importance of peaceful\r\ncoexistence; respect for plurality and diversity and the\r\npromotion of dialogue between various cultures and\r\nreligions; a reaffirmation of the need to achieve security\r\nand stability by resorting to the United Nations for the\r\nsettlement of conflicts between States; a reaffirmation of\r\nthe need to coordinate international efforts for the\r\nachievement of development and the eradication of poverty;\r\nand a reaffirmation of the resolve of the international\r\ncommunity to combat terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. In this regard, we would like to state our\r\nunderstanding that the adoption of a declaration by the\r\nMillennium Summit will not detract from the United\r\nNations Charter, which embodies lofty and noble principles\r\nvalid for all time.\r\nIn conclusion, most of the people of the Sudan are\r\nadherents of Islam and Christianity. Thus, the Sudan has a\r\nrich legacy of tolerance and coexistence between religions\r\nand cultures. Christianity, the religion of Jesus Christ —\r\npeace be upon him — teaches fraternity, tolerance and\r\nsuccour for the weak. Islam, the last of the revealed\r\nreligions, has brought an integrated way of life that upholds\r\nthe value of freedom and thought. It also consecrates the\r\nprinciple of coexistence between religions and cultures. The\r\nHoly Koran states,\r\n“Invite (all) to the Way\r\nOf thy Lord with wisdom\r\nAnd beautiful preaching;\r\nAnd argue with them\r\nIn ways that are best\r\nAnd most gracious.”\r\n(The Holy Koran, XVI:125).\r\nThe Acting President: In connection with a remark\r\nmade by an earlier speaker, may I remind speakers that\r\nonly the statement as actually delivered by the speaker to\r\nthe General Assembly will be reflected in the proceedings\r\nof the meeting.\r\nBefore giving the floor to the next speaker, may I\r\nask the remaining speakers, due to the late hour, to adhere\r\nto the voluntary 20-minute time-limit for statements.\r\nI now give the floor to the Assistant Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Saudi Arabia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Nizar Madani.\r\nMr. Madani (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): It is\r\nmy pleasure to express my sincere congratulations to\r\nMr. Gurirab on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. His election\r\nto this eminent position reflects the appreciation of the\r\ninternational community for him personally and for the\r\npositive role played by country, Namibia, in the\r\ninternational arena. I am confident that his presidency at\r\nthis session will be an effective factor in achieving the\r\nobjectives to which the international community aspires\r\nunder the present critical circumstances.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to convey to\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, Foreign Minister of Uruguay and\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession, our appreciation, esteem and praise for his\r\neffective, wise and objective conduct of the Assembly’s\r\nwork. I am also pleased to express my appreciation and\r\nesteem to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, who manages the affairs of this\r\ninternational Organization with great competence born of\r\nexperience and who makes continuous efforts and\r\npersistent endeavours to achieve peace, security and\r\nstability in our modern world.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is also pleased to\r\nwelcome the admission of the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to the\r\nmembership of the United Nations and hopes that their\r\nadmission will further enhance the effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization in achieving the noble goals it was created\r\nfor.\r\nSome years have passed since we celebrated the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. That\r\ncelebration was a glorious occasion on which we\r\nreviewed the purposes and principles of this international\r\nOrganization and the opportunities and challenges it had\r\nfaced over the previous decades. We also reviewed its\r\nachievements in maintaining world peace and security and\r\nthe difficulties and obstacles that it managed to deal with\r\nand overcome through the belief of its Members and the\r\nnobility of its ideals and objectives. The existence of this\r\nOrganization, and its ability to find solutions to many of\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nthe problems that have rocked our turbulent world, despite\r\nall the challenges it has faced, makes us all the more\r\nconvinced of the vitality of its role, a role that has become\r\nmore pressing and urgent due to recent developments in the\r\nworld.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as a founding Member\r\nof this Organization, continues to hold the same ideals and\r\nvalues that motivated it to join this universal effort with the\r\nother founding Members. The founders called for the\r\nrejection of war and the establishment of peace and for\r\nconstructive cooperation among all peoples of this world.\r\nThis was after a series of disasters and catastrophes had\r\noverwhelmed the human race during two destructive world\r\nwars that claimed millions of lives and left behind\r\ndevastation and ruin.\r\nWars and military confrontations are no longer thought\r\nof as politics or diplomacy by other means. Violence and\r\nwarfare with modern lethal weapons can never be an\r\neffective means to attain political ends, nor a viable\r\napproach to achieving diplomatic gains. In today’s world\r\nthere is no victor in any military confrontation.\r\nOur Organization’s objective of achieving cooperation\r\nin social and economic areas among peoples of the world\r\nis no longer a mere wish or luxury; in fact, it has become\r\nan unavoidable necessity as a result of recent political and\r\neconomic developments, as well as of major advances and\r\nrevolutions, unprecedented in human history, in technology\r\nand communications. As a result of these changes and\r\ndevelopments, the world has been transformed from a vast\r\ncollection of entities and multilateral trends and patterns\r\ninto a village in which every part is affected by what ails\r\nthe other part. These parts are interdependent as regards\r\nmany of their vital needs and environmental conditions. The\r\nconcept of globalization, which has become an integral part\r\nof our daily discourse, is nothing more than a condensed\r\nformula for the intellectual and existential changes that have\r\novertaken the lives of our people and the work of States in\r\nthe last two decades. If we are going to deal with this\r\nphenomenon in a way that emphasizes the positives and\r\ndiscards the negatives, we must adjust to it by developing\r\nour institutions and procedures.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia confirms, as it always\r\nhas in the past, its steady commitment to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and would\r\nlike to reiterate the need for supporting this Organization\r\nand its specialized agencies. They provide a viable\r\nframework for cooperation between countries and peoples\r\nfor facing the tidal wave of globalization. The Kingdom of\r\nSaudi Arabia also emphasizes once again that the ability\r\nof this international Organization to resolve global\r\nproblems and to fulfil its basic responsibilities depends\r\nvery much on the political will of the Member States to\r\nimplement the principles, ideals, visions and expectations\r\nembodied in the Organization’s Charter. What is meant\r\nby political will here is the degree to which each Member\r\nState is ready to carry out its commitment, adhere to the\r\nletter of the Charter of the United Nations and submit its\r\nconduct to the rules of the Charter. In this regard, my\r\nGovernment is quite cognizant of the importance of\r\nmodernizing the agencies of our Organization in a manner\r\nthat enables the Organization to play its required role and\r\nto deal with the new developments that are taking place\r\nin contemporary international relations.\r\nThe Security Council, being responsible for\r\npreserving international peace and security, remains the\r\npivot around which different kinds of ideas for reform are\r\nbeing expressed. In this regard, my country’s point of\r\nview continues to be based on a deep conviction that any\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council must endeavour to\r\nimprove its capabilities to perform effectively its role\r\nunder the Charter and to be more active in implementing\r\nits own resolutions and in dealing with international\r\ncrises. In addition, the policies of the Council should\r\nharmonize with the will of the General Assembly in a\r\nmanner that achieves the required balance and the desired\r\nobjectivity.\r\nThe General Assembly resolution declaring 2001 the\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nmanifests the desire of the international community to\r\nenter the third millennium firmly resolved to see\r\nharmony, justice and equality prevail among nations. It\r\nalso shows the Assembly’s desire for everyone to\r\nparticipate in building a world that is balanced in terms of\r\ninterests and mutual benefits in which people enjoy\r\nequitable living conditions free from fear, terror, hunger\r\nand poverty; a world in which the principles of justice,\r\ntriumph and peace and prosperity are available to all. The\r\ndialogue among civilizations is the ideal alternative to\r\ntheories of conflict and of the inevitable clash of\r\ncivilizations. This compels us to affirm the importance of\r\ndialogue and harmony among nations and the need to\r\nobserve differences in the nature of societies and in their\r\nbeliefs, and to respect peoples’ and nations’ freedom of\r\nchoice, as well as the need to abide by the rules of\r\ninternational law.\r\nThis Organization, in both the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly, has been preoccupied throughout\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nits history with the Middle East question and the\r\nachievement of a permanent and comprehensive solution to\r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict. When, in Madrid at the end of\r\nOctober 1991, the peace process was launched — with all\r\nits bilateral and multilateral tracks and on the basis of\r\nprinciples accepted by all parties to the conflict — everyone\r\nbelieved that a new era of peace, stability and growth was\r\nlooming and that this era would put an end to the phase of\r\nwars and conflicts that had exhausted the energies and\r\ncapabilities of the peoples of the region. In fact, the peace\r\nprocess in all its aspects did move forward and some\r\nprogress has been achieved, especially on the Palestinian\r\nand Jordanian tracks. The multilateral talks relating to\r\nregional cooperation also gained some ground. The peace\r\nprocess then suffered from paralysis and reached an\r\nimpasse due to the policies and practices of the former\r\nIsraeli Government, and in spite of the fact that the Arabs\r\nhad declared peace an irrevocable strategic choice.\r\nHowever, this did not change the practices of the former\r\nIsraeli Government and its disregard for the principles of\r\nthe peace process, nor remedy its failure to fulfil its\r\nobligations under the agreements signed with the\r\nPalestinians, including the Wye River Memorandum.\r\nAt present there is an attempt to revive the peace\r\nprocess. Assurances issued by the new Israeli Prime\r\nMinister indicate that he intends to activate the peace\r\nprocess on all tracks. The Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum,\r\nsigned on 4 September of this year, could be a good step if\r\nfollowed by similar steps to move the process towards the\r\nbases and principles that were established at the Madrid\r\nConference — the principle of land for peace, first and\r\nforemost.\r\nOn the Palestinian track, peace requires withdrawal\r\nfrom the occupied territories and the restoration of all the\r\nlegitimate national rights of the Palestinians, including their\r\nright to establish their own independent State with\r\nJerusalem as its capital. The final status issue of Jerusalem\r\nshould be addressed in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 252 (1968). Jerusalem is part of\r\nthe occupied territories, and Israel should refrain from\r\nundertaking any unilateral measures that prejudice the status\r\nof that sacred city. It is imperative and natural that any\r\ncomprehensive and permanent settlement address the issue\r\nof the return of the Palestinian refugees, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III). It should also\r\naddress the issues of the release of prisoners, settlements\r\nand water resources, among others.\r\nAs for the Syrian track, negotiations should resume at\r\nthe point where they left off because of a decision of the\r\nprevious Israeli Government. It is well known that Syria\r\nremains willing and prepared to reach a comprehensive\r\nand permanent solution based on the principle of land for\r\npeace.\r\nThe Lebanese track is subject to Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978), which calls for the immediate and\r\nunconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces from\r\nsouthern Lebanon and western Bekaa.\r\nMore than nine years after Iraq’s aggression against\r\nthe State of Kuwait, it is still procrastinating on the\r\nimplementation of crucial parts of the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. The Iraqi people are still paying the\r\nprice for crimes committed by their regime and for its\r\ncontinual challenges to international legality. In spite of\r\nall Arab and international initiatives and proposals aimed\r\nat finding an effective mechanism and process to lift the\r\neconomic sanctions imposed on Iraq and to end the\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people, the Iraqi Government has\r\nnot responded in a manner that might help move matters\r\nin the right direction.\r\nWhat encourages the Iraqi Government to continue\r\nmanoeuvring and procrastinating is the fact that the\r\nSecurity Council itself is unable to take action due to the\r\ninability of its permanent members to agree on a common\r\napproach and on the proposals under discussion. These\r\nproposals are aimed at finding a way out of the current\r\ncrisis by reviving the inspection and monitoring of banned\r\nIraqi weapons and at regulating the present and future\r\nrelations between Iraq and the United Nations. No matter\r\nwhat the circumstances, Iraq should be required to fully\r\nimplement all international resolutions relating to its\r\naggression against Kuwait and to cooperate seriously with\r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross to achieve\r\nthe release of all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners and\r\ndetainees, as well as the restitution of Kuwaiti property.\r\nIt should also refrain from all provocative or\r\naggressive acts against the State of Kuwait and other\r\nneighbouring countries, in compliance with Security\r\nCouncil resolution 949 (1994), and prove its peaceful\r\nintentions towards its neighbours in word and deed. This\r\nis the proper way to put an end to the human suffering\r\nfor which the Iraqi regime bears sole responsibility. The\r\npain which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its sisterly\r\ncountries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) feel\r\ntowards such human suffering is commensurate only with\r\ntheir keenness to preserve the independence, unity and\r\nterritorial integrity of Iraq.\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nRelations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the\r\nGulf Cooperation Council member States have lately been\r\nbuoyed by the positive attitude of the Iranian Government.\r\nYet, there remain outstanding issues to be resolved,\r\nparticularly that of the three United Arab Emirates islands\r\nof Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. The GCC\r\nForeign Ministers, with the approval and blessing of the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates Government, decided to refer the\r\nmatter to a tripartite committee entrusted with creating a\r\nclimate conducive to direct negotiations between the United\r\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. This trend\r\nreflects the desire of the United Arab Emirates to resolve\r\nthe outstanding issues in a positive spirit. We feel\r\noptimistic about this issue in the light of the demonstrated\r\ndesire of President Mohammad Khatami to open a new\r\nchapter in Iran\u0027s relations with the Gulf countries,\r\ncharacterized by good-neighbourliness, non-interference in\r\ninternal affairs and constructive cooperation to the benefit\r\nand interest of both sides.\r\nJust when it seemed that the problem of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina was resolved in accordance with the provisions\r\nof the Dayton Accords — which laid the ground for\r\nBosnian independence and sovereignty, paved the way for\r\nthe return of refugees, provided for the pursuit and arrest of\r\nofficials responsible for the crimes of ethnic cleansing and\r\ngenocide, and the establishment of domestic peace — the\r\nBalkan region witnessed a crisis in Kosovo no less\r\ndevastating in its human dimensions than that in Bosnia.\r\nLike the Bosnians, the Kosovars were exposed to ethnic\r\ncleansing, genocide, repression, intimidation and forced\r\ndeportation at the hands of Serbian forces as the world\r\nwatched. Once again, the United Nations faced the problem\r\nof dealing with a dangerous situation that threatened the\r\nentire Balkan region. This situation was reversed only by\r\nthe intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\nforces after Serbia refused to accept the provisions of the\r\nRambouillet agreement.\r\nResort to military force without a United Nations\r\nmandate to resolve such problems might not be the ideal\r\nway to settle international crises, but it becomes an\r\nunavoidable necessity whenever the Security Council, due\r\nto disunity and disagreements between its permanent\r\nMembers, fails to fulfil its role in maintaining world peace\r\nand security. We hope that this pattern will not be repeated,\r\nso that the United Nations may preserve its dignity and\r\nintegrity.\r\nMany regions of the world remain plagued by wars,\r\nregional and ethnic conflicts, border disputes and national\r\nand tribal conflicts. Fighting between the Afghan factions\r\nstill rages, denying Afghanistan and its people the fruits\r\nof liberation from foreign occupation. It is regrettable to\r\nsee that some have exploited the current situation in\r\nAfghanistan to turn the country into a terrorist haven and\r\ntraining base, thereby contributing to the country\u0027s\r\ninsecurity and instability and exposing the Afghan people\r\nto more suffering. My country supports the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of Islamic\r\nConference to re-establish peace and security throughout\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nThe Pakistani-Indian conflict over Jammu and\r\nKashmir remains a source of tension and instability\r\nbetween the two neighbourly countries, especially after\r\nthe recent military escalation between them. We call on\r\nboth sides to exercise utmost restraint and to settle the\r\nconflict through negotiations in compliance with United\r\nNations resolutions, which recognize the right of the\r\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir to self-determination.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been following\r\nwith great concern the latest developments in East Timor.\r\nWhile it welcomes the positive stand taken by the\r\nIndonesian Government, especially its cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations, it wishes to affirm the need to respect\r\nthe regional sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia and\r\nthe importance of peace and security throughout the\r\nregion.\r\nThe scenes of fighting and armed conflict between\r\nbrothers in Africa, especially in the Horn, are a source of\r\npain to us. These conflicts will only deepen wounds and\r\nenlarge the circle of poverty and distress. In this regard,\r\nwe still have high expectations in the wisdom of the\r\nleaders of that great continent to consider the ultimate\r\ninterests of their nations and to resolve conflicts through\r\npeaceful means.\r\nThe international community was pleased to put an\r\nend to the Lockerbie issue, which caused much suffering\r\nfor Libya and its people. We look forward to a Security\r\nCouncil resolution that would lead to a final lifting of all\r\nsanctions imposed on Libya by virtue of its positive\r\nreaction to international appeals and its adherence to all\r\nconditions related to this issue.\r\nI would also like to praise the people of Algeria for\r\nthe great mandate they gave their new leadership to move\r\nforward with the suggested reconciliation plan that aims\r\nat ending the era of differences and violence, which was\r\nextremely painful for the fraternal people of Algeria.\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nThe Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy\r\nMosques is keenly interested in the ongoing efforts to\r\neliminate weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East,\r\nincluding the Arabian Gulf region. This is demonstrated\r\nthrough its support for the efforts of the Arab League at its\r\n101st session, which called for making that sensitive part of\r\nthe world a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction,\r\nbe they nuclear, chemical or biological. In this respect, we\r\nare greatly concerned about Israel\u0027s continued refusal to\r\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT), thus keeping its nuclear programmes\r\noutside the range of international inspections and\r\nconstituting a serious threat to the region\u0027s security.\r\nWe believe in the urgent need to increase the\r\neffectiveness of the NPT through the activation and\r\nuniversalization of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency\u0027s safeguards system. We also find it extremely\r\nimportant to establish the necessary controls and measures\r\nthat would assist in achieving progress in all areas of the\r\ncomprehensive disarmament of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, in conformity with General Assembly\r\nresolution 1 (I) of 1946.\r\nThe scourge of terrorism, which strikes\r\nindiscriminately throughout the world, has become an\r\ninternational phenomenon with grave consequences,\r\nrequiring systematic international efforts to contain and\r\ncombat it. The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia has regularly condemned terrorism in all its forms,\r\nlending its voice to international efforts aimed at combating\r\nthis dangerous phenomenon. What needs to be emphasized\r\nhere is that violence and terrorism are universal phenomena\r\nnot restricted to a certain people, race or religion. Precisely\r\nbecause of the comprehensiveness and universality of\r\nterrorism, the only way to combat it effectively is through\r\nunified and collective international action within the\r\nframework of the United Nations, which alone can put an\r\nend to terrorism, save the lives of innocent people and\r\npreserve the independence and sovereignty of the countries\r\nof the world. Fighting terrorism calls for international\r\ncooperation against sheltering terrorist groups and\r\nindividuals, thereby preventing them from exploiting the\r\nterritories and laws of the States where they live to pursue\r\ntheir destructive activities, regardless of their pretexts and\r\narguments.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considers environmental\r\nissues and environmental protection of key importance, as\r\nevidenced by their prominent place in our domestic and\r\nforeign policies. This is because we believe that a safe\r\ndecent life for mankind is directly connected to the\r\nenvironment. That is why the Kingdom has actively\r\nparticipated in all relevant conferences and international\r\ngatherings, symposiums and arrangements. We have also\r\nbecome party to several regional and international\r\nagreements that are geared towards this cause. We only\r\nhope that international efforts related to the problems of\r\nthe environment will be formulated in a balanced and\r\nobjective manner based on serious scientific facts and\r\nstudies that take into account development needs in the\r\ndeveloping world. We call upon all States to abide by\r\nAgenda 21. We also urge the industrialized States in\r\nparticular to live up to their obligations regarding the\r\ntransfer of environment-friendly technology to the\r\ndeveloping nations.\r\nThe emerging phenomenon of globalization, which\r\nis forcing geographic borders to recede and sovereignty\r\nand political barriers to disappear, has become an issue to\r\nwhich all nations must adjust. We are required now, more\r\nthan ever before, to address this phenomenon in a way\r\nthat brings about a world of balanced interests, mutual\r\nbenefits and equal opportunities for all. If we are to\r\nachieve this goal, the developing nations must redouble\r\ntheir domestic environmental efforts in order to catch up\r\nwith the global economy. They are further called upon to\r\nintensify their efforts to remove the barriers that hinder\r\ntheir integration into the multifaceted world trade system.\r\nThey are also required to adjust their economic policies\r\nand to establish the infrastructures necessary for their\r\nmanufactured goods to meet the standard specifications of\r\nthe importing countries.\r\nIn return, industrial and economically developed\r\nnations should contribute to the fulfilment of the desired\r\ngoals in the following ways: first, by displaying greater\r\nflexibility in the conditions of admission to the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) by giving developing\r\ncountries longer interim periods that are in line with their\r\ndevelopment needs and to help them adjust their systems\r\nand laws to the requirements of membership; secondly, by\r\ngiving developing countries enhanced opportunities to\r\nbenefit from the system of general preferences, to expand\r\ndistribution of their products and to provide guarantees\r\nfor greater stability and transparency in the regimes\r\ngoverning those products; thirdly, by limiting the\r\nimposition of protective measures by industrialized\r\nnations on major imports from developing nations that\r\nhinder their integration into world markets and reduce\r\ntheir ability to compete, and removing the obstacles faced\r\nby developing countries; and fourthly, ensuring that\r\nindustrial nations carry out their obligations to developing\r\ncountries, as set forth in the Uruguay Round and in the\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nWTO agreements, by providing direct and indirect\r\nassistance and restructuring or forgiveness of debts. The\r\nindustrialized nations should also open their markets to the\r\ndeveloping nations’ exports and refrain from adopting\r\nunjust procedures to limit the size and flow of such exports.\r\nIn this context, it is worth noting that the Kingdom of\r\nSaudi Arabia has been at the forefront of contributions to\r\nthe promotion and development of developing countries,\r\nwhether bilaterally or multilaterally. In the same vein, and\r\nin view of the Kingdom’s desire to shape future trends in\r\nthe world economy, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has\r\napplied for admission to the WTO and hopes, God willing,\r\nto gain the support of friendly nations in order to finalize\r\nthe admission procedure as soon as possible.\r\nAs we prepare for the third millennium, we are\r\noverwhelmed by different feelings and emotions. In view of\r\nthe conflicts and the social, economic, cultural and\r\nenvironmental challenges that we currently face, optimism\r\nis mixed with pessimism about the future of our world in\r\nthe coming historical period. If the purpose of creating the\r\nUnited Nations was to convert the logic of war and\r\nconfrontation into the language of dialogue and cooperation,\r\nat a time when the cost of using military force has become\r\nexorbitant and the outcome uncertain, we now live in a new\r\nperiod full of signs that require us to work together as hard\r\nas possible and to cooperate not only in the face of political\r\nand military challenges, but also in confronting the new\r\nchallenges of contemporary life, with all its complexities\r\nand complications, which can only be solved or managed\r\nthrough organized collective efforts.\r\nOur firm belief that the United Nations can play a\r\nmajor role in dealing with current issues and enhancing\r\ninternational cooperation in order to resolve and contain\r\nthese issues makes us more determined than ever to support\r\nthis Organization and endorse its constructive role. One of\r\nthe valuable lessons we have learned from United Nations\r\nactivities is the need to enable our Organization to detect\r\ncrises and to move to contain them before they erupt by\r\napplying preventive diplomacy to the fullest extent. Moving\r\nto manage crises before they grow is the best way to avoid\r\ntheir harmful consequences and repercussions.\r\nIn conclusion, I must re-emphasize a basic fact: in\r\norder to solve today’s problems it has become vitally\r\nnecessary for us to cooperate in a spirit of total disinterest,\r\nobjectivity and responsibility. The future of the United\r\nNations, which is also our future, depends on this.\r\nAllah says in the Holy Koran:\r\n“Help ye one another\r\nIn righteousness and piety,\r\nBut help ye not one another\r\nIn sin and rancour”.\r\n(The Holy Koran, V:2)\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra\r\nLeone, His Excellency Mr. Sama Banya.\r\nMr. Banya (Sierra Leone): On behalf of President\r\nAhmad Tejan Kabbah, the Government and people of\r\nSierra Leone, and on my own personal behalf, I would\r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Gurirab most heartily on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fourth session. This is the last session before the end\r\nof this century and today we have only 92 days until the\r\nbeginning of a new millennium.\r\nWe welcome Mr. Gurirab’s unanimous election to\r\npreside over this body. With his long experience, both in\r\nthe public service of his country and in the international\r\narena, I have no doubt that he will be able to steer the\r\ndeliberations of the fifty-fourth session to a successful\r\nconclusion. I want to assure him of my delegation’s full\r\nsupport and cooperation during his tenure of office.\r\nThe affairs that confront us as a country continue to\r\ncause problems all over the globe. We are faced with\r\nsituations that we cannot completely handle. Permit me to\r\nconvey the thanks and appreciation of my Government to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to his staff\r\nfor their dedicated service to the United Nations in the\r\nnever-ending quest to attain international peace and\r\nsecurity. Mr. Annan has spared no efforts in drawing the\r\nattention of the international community, as well as that\r\nof the Security Council, to the tragic situation in Sierra\r\nLeone, stressing the urgent need for resources to sustain\r\nthe Lomé Peace Agreement, recently signed between the\r\nGovernment of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary\r\nUnited Front (RUF), and the need to send an appreciable\r\ncontingent of peacekeepers and United Nations military\r\nobservers to my country.\r\nThe rebel war has gone on for a long time. Its\r\nintensification culminated in the invasion of the capital,\r\nFreetown, by the RUF/Armed Forces Revolutionary\r\nCouncil junta on 6 January 1999. I have no doubt that\r\nmany members must have watched, heard or read of the\r\nensuing mayhem, even though those ghastly events were\r\noverlooked because of the focus of the international\r\nmedia and, indeed, of the international community on\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nKosovo. There was a time when we felt that the\r\ninternational community had abandoned us to our fate.\r\nOur people have gone through a very difficult and\r\ndevastating period, covering more than eight years. We are\r\nnow ready to put that nightmare behind us, to move\r\nforward and to do so quickly. The most important element\r\nin this is the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration\r\nprogramme, under the supervision of United Nations\r\npeacekeepers and observers and the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group\r\n(ECOMOG).\r\nMy Government therefore welcomes the eighth report\r\nof the Secretary-General on Sierra Leone to the Security\r\nCouncil. Among other things, the report recommends the\r\ndeployment of sufficient numbers of peacekeepers and\r\nobservers, as well as support staff. The Secretary-General\r\nstresses the urgent need for the mobilization of adequate\r\nresources into a special trust fund for this purpose. My\r\ndelegation welcomes with gratitude the contributions of the\r\nGovernments of the United Kingdom and Canada and the\r\nWorld Bank to the trust fund, and the recent\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary- General to the Security\r\nCouncil to deploy up to 6,000 peacekeepers and observers.\r\nThe need for an early decision on this cannot be\r\noveremphasized.\r\nA special conference is to take place shortly in\r\nWashington, D.C., for pledges to the fund and for other\r\npost-conflict programmes, including humanitarian\r\nassistance, the welfare of refugees and the welfare of\r\nchildren associated with the war. I would like to thank all\r\nour friends in the donor community who will be\r\nparticipating in that meeting and to plead with them to\r\ndonate generously.\r\nSince the signing of the Lomé Agreement, the peace\r\nhas been generally holding. There have been a few severe\r\nhiccups, but because of the determination of all to move\r\nforward, we have been able to contain the situation. The\r\nwar went on for a long time; the rebels were used to\r\nobtaining everything they needed by the use of force. Since\r\nthe Agreement, they have simply been waiting for the\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme\r\nto commence. The delay in implementing this could be a\r\nfactor in the restlessness observed in some elements from\r\ntime to time. It is a dangerous void.\r\nThe programme itself is under the chairmanship of our\r\nPresident, and because of the importance that our people\r\nattach to it, the civilian population has established a fund\r\nthat is receiving modest donations from an already\r\ntraumatized and war-weary people. Unfortunately, the\r\nanxiety and enthusiasm of our people have yet to be\r\nmatched by those of the international community.\r\nThe speed and the extent of interventions in Bosnia\r\nand in Kosovo, and more recently in East Timor, clearly\r\ndemonstrate the capacity of the international community\r\nto stop human suffering when it is willing to do so. Our\r\npeople have been baffled at the delay in implementing the\r\nSierra Leone programme.\r\nAlthough the heinous atrocities committed in Sierra\r\nLeone by the RUF and its collaborators barely received\r\nattention from the international community, various\r\nhuman rights groups denounced the United Nations for\r\nsigning the Lomé Peace Agreement with a reservation on\r\namnesty provision. May I at this stage appeal to the\r\ninternational community not to do anything that would\r\nadversely affect the implementation of the Peace\r\nAgreement.\r\nFor the average Sierra Leonean, the Peace\r\nAgreement was a bitter pill to swallow, but an essential\r\npill to end the atrocities in the country. However, in order\r\nto ensure accountability, a truth and reconciliation\r\ncommission was provided for in the agreement. It may\r\nneed to be backed by an international inquiry body, such\r\nas has been proposed by the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\r\nOnce again I would like to put on record my\r\ncountry’s indebtedness and gratitude to the member States\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), and four countries in particular — Nigeria,\r\nGuinea, Ghana and Mali — which contributed troops to\r\nthe ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG).\r\nAs a new millennium dawns, the problems facing\r\nmy country — and indeed many developing countries —\r\nare multiple; not least is the problem of finding a\r\nconsistent set of policies and institutions that will enable\r\nus to have sustainable economic growth. Coupled with\r\nthis is the fact that newly elected democratic\r\nGovernments like ours are facing the paradox of how to\r\nsustain democracy in an environment where hard\r\neconomic decisions are needed. In an increasingly\r\nshrinking world, the problems of developing countries,\r\nincluding those of Sierra Leone, ought to be seen as\r\nglobal problems.\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nThe impact of these problems is felt by all in the form\r\nof environmental devastation, global warming, economic\r\nmigrations and conflict, both local and regional. These\r\nproblems affect the developed world in the form of\r\nincreased immigration, greater welfare bills, slower\r\neconomic growth and increased defence budgets, due to\r\ngreater instability in the third world and the increased need\r\nfor conflict resolution and prevention.\r\nIn these circumstances, the continuing decline in the\r\nlevels of development assistance has not helped the African\r\nsituation. Globalization cannot be effected as a “one-way\r\nstreet” where all the vehicles travel North, leaving only\r\nexhaust fumes in the South. A level playing field is\r\nrequired, and this cannot be achieved with Africa’s heavy\r\ndebt burden. Sierra Leone welcomes the 1999 Cologne\r\nDebt Initiative, which enhances the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative framework for debt relief. We\r\nagree that further efforts are needed for greater focus on the\r\npriority objective of poverty reduction. At the same time,\r\nmy delegation hopes that agreement will soon be reached\r\nto shorten the period during which countries can qualify to\r\nbe part of the HIPC Debt Initiative framework.\r\nWith the cold war over, mankind had looked forward\r\nto a period of peace and universal development. But, as the\r\nBritish Foreign Secretary Robin Cook observed at the\r\nrecent Security Council meeting on trafficking in small\r\narms, small arms have caused more death and destruction\r\nin recent times than weapons of mass destruction. Indeed,\r\nmy delegation agrees with the general view that the illegal\r\narms trade is as dangerous as drugs, both serving as\r\ninstruments of destruction of civilian lives and of socio-\r\neconomic structures.\r\nThe proliferation of trade in light weapons, financed\r\nby cash from the sale of precious minerals, such as\r\ndiamonds and gold, is at the core of Africa’s conflicts and\r\ntheir prolongation. My delegation therefore welcomes the\r\nrecent decision of the Security Council on this nefarious\r\ntrade. We call on the international community to support\r\nthe Security Council decision so as to effectively prevent\r\nthe availability and flow of arms to conflict areas. The\r\ndecision should not be left to the merchants of death, whose\r\nonly interest is money, by whatever means.\r\nThe United Nations, despite its occasional\r\nimperfectability, remains an essential institution for moving\r\ninternational relations towards cooperative security. Its\r\noperational and procedural capabilities need to be\r\nstrengthened for the next century. My Government fully\r\nsupports the Declaration of Algiers, adopted by the\r\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, meeting in Algeria from\r\n12-14 July 1999. The Declaration called, inter alia, for\r\nthe democratization of international relations, the\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations and the Security\r\nCouncil and the recognition of Africa’s legitimate position\r\nin this Organization.\r\nMy Government also reinforces its belief in the\r\nHarare Declaration, calling for the unconditional\r\nallocation of two permanent Security Council seats to\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right\r\nof reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second, and\r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Smith (United Kingdom): I should like to speak\r\nbriefly in exercise of the right of reply to respond to the\r\nremarks about the Chagos Archipelago made this morning\r\nby the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and International Trade of Mauritius.\r\nThe British Government maintains that the British\r\nIndian Ocean Territory is British and has been since\r\n1814. It does not recognize the sovereignty claim of the\r\nMauritian Government. However, the British Government\r\nhas recognized Mauritius as the only State which has a\r\nright to assert a claim of sovereignty when the United\r\nKingdom relinquishes its own sovereignty. Successive\r\nBritish Governments have given undertakings to the\r\nGovernment of Mauritius that the Territory will be ceded\r\nwhen no longer required for defence purposes.\r\nThe British Government remains open to discussions\r\nregarding arrangements governing the British Indian\r\nOcean Territory or the future of the Territory. The British\r\nGovernment has stated that when the time comes for the\r\nTerritory to be ceded it will liaise closely with the\r\nGovernment of Mauritius.\r\nThe question of access to the British Indian Ocean\r\nTerritory is at present before the courts in the United\r\nKingdom, and is therefore sub judice. The Government of\r\nthe United Kingdom has the matter under careful\r\nconsideration and cannot comment further.\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\nMr. Choe Myong Nam (Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea): The South Korean Foreign Minister\r\nhas talked about the “sunshine” policy, describing it as if it\r\nwere contributing to the improvement of North-South\r\nrelations, with a view to misleading the people of the\r\nworld, even at the United Nations. Although his allegation,\r\nfull of fabrication and distortion and aimed at confrontation\r\nwith the North, does not merit a penny\u0027s worth of comment,\r\nwe believe it is necessary to make clear the essence of the\r\n“sunshine” policy and the ill intention of the South Korean\r\nauthorities in order to promote representatives\u0027\r\nunderstanding.\r\nThe trend towards reconciliation and rapprochement\r\nwhich was created following the end of the cold war has\r\nyet to prevail on the Korean peninsula, due mainly to the\r\nstrategic intentions of the United States and the consistent\r\nreliance of the South Korean authorities on outside forces.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, North-South relations are now\r\nat their worst level. The South Korean authorities are now\r\npursuing an unprecedentedly tricky policy of antagonizing\r\nthe Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea hand in hand\r\nwith outside forces. They loudly proclaim engagement and\r\ngenerosity as though the “sunshine” policy were intended\r\nto improve North-South relations.\r\nHowever, the “sunshine” policy is an anti-reunification\r\nand anti-Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea\r\nconfrontational policy aimed at changing the ideas and\r\nsocial system existing in the North. It is also a provocation\r\nagainst, and mockery of, the Democratic People\u0027s Republic\r\nof Korea.\r\nThe current Chief Executive of South Korea openly\r\nacknowledges that the essence of the “sunshine” policy is\r\nbased on the same principle as was utilized by the United\r\nStates in the disintegration of the former Soviet Union.\r\nBesides, the South Korean authorities are now engaged in\r\nthe plot, in military alliance with countries such as the\r\nUnited States and Japan, on an almost daily basis under the\r\npretext of the “sunshine” policy.\r\nAny attempt on their part to deny and do away with\r\nthe ideas and social system in the North will inevitably lead\r\nto conflict and war and this could happen at any moment.\r\nThe South Korean authorities are now talking loudly about\r\nreconciliation and cooperation with us while promoting the\r\n“sunshine” policy, but it is, in essence, preposterous\r\nhypocrisy and deceit, as well as a mockery of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nUnder these circumstances, in which the Draconian\r\nNational Security Law that defines the North as a\r\npermanent enemy to be exterminated and that criminalizes\r\nminor contacts, praise and encouragement, sympathy and\r\neven the exchange of letters with the North remains in\r\nplace, how is it possible to realize reconciliation and\r\ncooperation? The existence of a concrete wall remaining\r\nas a symbol of the national division and the military\r\nexercises being staged almost year-round in collaboration\r\nwith foreign forces are incompatible with reconciliation\r\nand cooperation.\r\nSouth Korea acts as if the North had greatly\r\nbenefited from the “sunshine” policy in the economic\r\nfield, but this too is a lie.\r\nFrankly, they mobilized many representatives of the\r\nmass media for the purpose of publicizing the economic\r\nand humanitarian assistance given to the North, but in\r\nreality they are playing dirty games. For example, they\r\nare pretending to show their sympathy for the\r\nhumanitarian situation of the North, but actually they are\r\nvisiting countries to ask them not to give assistance to the\r\nNorth. By so doing, they are slandering and obstructing\r\nthe flow of humanitarian assistance in one way or\r\nanother.\r\nWe have so far established a self-sufficient national\r\neconomy of which we are proud. But recently we have\r\nhad some economic difficulties due to natural disaster and\r\nthe collapse of the socialist market. Nevertheless, we will\r\nbuild a strong and rich country by resisting the slander\r\nand the current economic difficulties.\r\nThe Korean Peninsula Energy Development\r\nOrganization has been described as a gift given to us out\r\nof generosity, but in fact the construction of the light\r\nwater reactor power plant, which is the central mission of\r\nthat organization is an obligation that the United States\r\nassumed under the Agreed Framework signed by the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea and the United\r\nStates in 1994. South Korea, Japan and other countries\r\nbecame members of the organization at the request of the\r\nUnited States. However, the construction of the light\r\nwater reactor power plant has just been inaugurated, and\r\nnot a single stone has yet been laid. Therefore, there is a\r\nquestion as to its completion in the year 2003, as\r\nenvisaged in the Agreed Framework.\r\nIn addition, there have been recent reports that the\r\nconstruction of the light water reactor power plant is only\r\nbeing paid lip service, because of the prediction that my\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 19th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 30 September 1999\r\ncountry would soon collapse. This makes prospects for its\r\nconstruction more questionable. As for the tourism in\r\nMount Kumgang it was out of our genuine love for our\r\nnational compatriots, our benevolence and our generosity\r\nthat we have extended the opportunity to the South Koreans\r\nwho very much want to visit Mount Kumgang.\r\nUnfortunately, however, South Korea is including some\r\nundesirable people among the tourists in order to create an\r\nartificial obstacle to the work of tourism and in this way to\r\nfurther damage our prestige.\r\nAs to our implementation of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Safeguards\r\nAgreement, South Korea has no right to intervene. The\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea-United States\r\nAgreed Framework clearly provides for all the obligations\r\nof both my country and the United States. We are now\r\nfaithfully fulfilling our obligation in keeping with the\r\nimplementation of the Agreed Framework. The\r\nresponsibility for the non-realization of the denuclearization\r\nof the Korean peninsula lies with the United States, which\r\nis still maintaining its commitment of providing a nuclear\r\numbrella for South Korea. The responsibility also lies with\r\nSouth Korea, which is asking for that commitment to be\r\nmaintained.\r\nAs can clearly be seen, the “sunshine” policy is an\r\nanti-reunification and anti-Democratic People\u0027s Republic\r\nof Korea confrontational policy camouflaged as\r\nreconciliation and cooperation. If the South Korean\r\nauthorities are truly interested in peace and the peaceful\r\nreunification of the Korean peninsula, they should\r\nabandon the “sunshine” policy and the policy of relying\r\non outside foreign forces; should take a position of\r\nnational independence and demand the withdrawal of\r\nUnited States troops from South Korea; should abolish the\r\nNational Security Law; and should respond to our\r\nproposal for confederal reunification on the basis of the\r\nthree principles of independence, peaceful reunification\r\nand great national unity.\r\nMr. Gold (Israel): The statement by the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Mr. Farouk\r\nAl-Shara’, asserts that commitments were made by the\r\nparties during past Syrian-Israeli negotiations that\r\nconstitute internationally binding undertakings which have\r\nbeen deposited with the United States. These assertions do\r\nnot accurately reflect the facts, and therefore a\r\nclarification by Israel is required.\r\nIsrael has not made any commitment to withdraw to\r\nthe line of 4 June 1967. It must be reiterated that the only\r\nbasis of negotiations between Israel and Syria is Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as stated\r\nin the Madrid invitation, which called for the\r\nestablishment of secure and recognized boundaries and\r\nnot for a withdrawal to the line of 4 June 1967.\r\nMr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The allegations we have just heard from the\r\nrepresentative of Israel require a precise and well-\r\npondered response, especially since American efforts are\r\nunder way to resume peace negotiations at the point\r\nwhere they were left off. However, given the late hour,\r\nnot wishing to detain representatives, and heeding the\r\nChair\u0027s appeal to be brief, my delegation reserves the\r\nright to reply at the end of tomorrow\u0027s meeting so that we\r\nmight be able to inform the General Assembly of the\r\nactual state of affairs.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7 p.m.\r\n41\r\n"
