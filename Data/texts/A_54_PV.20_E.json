(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan\r\nThe President: This morning the Assembly will first\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nTajikistan.\r\nMr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President of the Republic of\r\nTajikistan, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His\r\nExcellency Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Rakhmonov (spoke in Russian): First of all,\r\npermit me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to your\r\nimportant post as President of the General Assembly. We\r\nare convinced that thanks to your wisdom and experience\r\nyou will successfully guide the deliberations of this\r\nimportant forum.\r\nOver the past century mankind has made\r\nunprecedented strides in its overall progress. It has\r\ndemonstrated with unprecedented force the creative genius\r\nand potential of the human mind. But at the same time,\r\nunfortunately, it has highlighted inherent human failings\r\nthat are the root causes of tremendous social and political\r\nupheavals, the further exacerbation of global problems\r\nand the emergence of new challenges.\r\nOne of the most significant achievements of the\r\ntwentieth century is the founding of the United Nations,\r\nwith its indispensable legal framework and mechanisms\r\ngiving it the tools to organize collective action on the part\r\nof States in order to counter current and future threats.\r\nTajikistan would like to see the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations and of its Security Council, as the body\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIt is extremely timely and useful, on the threshold of\r\nthe twenty-first century, to rethink philosophically the\r\nlessons we have learned in order to define the principal\r\nparameters of a future world order and to develop a\r\nprogramme of action to put them into practice.\r\nWe see many valuable and mutually enriching ideas\r\nin such initiatives as the convening in the year 2000, at\r\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, and the\r\nmillennium summit; the proposal by Russia to elaborate\r\na concept of peace in the twenty-first century; the idea of\r\nIran of a dialogue between civilizations; and the plans of\r\na number of States regarding a culture of peace and other\r\ninitiatives.\r\nTajikistan, for its part, intends to continue\r\ncontributing, insofar as it is able, to this intellectual\r\nendeavour aimed at encouraging all States to join their\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nefforts and concentrate on the main areas of international\r\ncooperation.\r\nHaving won their independence eight years ago, the\r\npeople of Tajikistan have made their choice in favour of\r\ndemocracy. Although our movement towards the reform of\r\nthe political system and market transformations in the social\r\nand political sphere has been seriously tested, despite all\r\nodds we have risen to the challenge. Today we can state\r\nfirmly that we will not veer from the road we have chosen\r\nof building a democratic, law-abiding and secular society in\r\nTajikistan.\r\nThe most recent proof of this are the results of a\r\npopular referendum on amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan, held on 26 September last,\r\nwhich have demonstrated growing support for efforts of the\r\nGovernment to establish lasting peace and accord in our\r\ncountry and, on that basis, to build up further civil society\r\nand to form stable democratic institutions.\r\nMany States have needed hundreds of years to reach\r\ntoday’s level of democracy. Tajikistan, like other new or\r\nrestored democracies, will have to cover that distance\r\nwithin a shorter period of time while gradually tackling\r\ndifficult and complex tasks in the civil, political, economic,\r\nsocial and cultural areas. It is clear that this will require\r\ntimely, adequate and coordinated support from the United\r\nNations, and we look forward to such support.\r\nI wish to note with great satisfaction that the\r\ntransitional period provided for in the General Agreement\r\non the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in\r\nTajikistan has entered its final stretch. Thus the way\r\ntowards further strengthening of the fundamentals of\r\npeaceful democratic development has now been opened up.\r\nIn this context of critical importance, we are looking\r\nforward in the next few months to presidential and\r\nparliamentary elections in Tajikistan, which we hope will\r\nbe successful with the necessary assistance from the United\r\nNations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe.\r\nNow more than ever before, the peace process in\r\nTajikistan needs active support, particularly material and\r\nfinancial assistance from the international community. We\r\nhope to see remedied very soon the situation wherein donor\r\nStates allocated only a small percentage of funds pledged\r\nin response to the appeal made this year by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations for humanitarian assistance\r\nto Tajikistan. We would like also to express the hope that\r\nat the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, as in\r\nprevious years, full support will be forthcoming for the\r\ndraft resolution on granting international assistance for\r\npost-conflict projects in Tajikistan.\r\nThe Government of Tajikistan, despite great\r\ndifficulties, has consistently been implementing a\r\nprogramme of economic reforms in order to create an\r\neffective market economy. Step by step, an appropriate\r\nlegal framework is being set up to provide a favourable\r\nenvironment for the development of small and\r\nmedium-sized businesses, for foreign investments and for\r\nthe promotion of market institutions, including in the\r\nareas of finance and banking.\r\nThe efforts of our Government are being supported\r\nby the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and\r\na number of other influential and authoritative\r\ninternational financial and economic institutions and\r\nagencies. At this new stage of development resulting from\r\nthe transformation in our economic and political systems,\r\nwe in Tajikistan are counting on the international\r\ncommunity to provide as much support and assistance as\r\nit can.\r\nThe disparity in the value placed on human life and\r\ntragedy depending on whether one is in Europe or\r\nelsewhere is cause for profound regret. If a hotbed of\r\ntension flares up in Europe, it is contained and eliminated\r\non the double. And this is wonderful. However, it is\r\nparticularly hard for us to bear given the large-scale\r\nconflicts that have been spilling blood in Asia for\r\ndecades. And is Afghanistan really not a European\r\nproblem — Afghanistan, whose drugs are destroying the\r\nlives of hundreds of thousands of unfortunates, including\r\nin Europe? Afghanistan is not just Asia’s pain and\r\ntragedy. It is Europe’s, too.\r\nWe are extremely perturbed by the continuing intra-\r\nAfghan conflict. The international community must take\r\nall necessary steps to restore peace in Afghanistan as\r\nquickly as possible. It is unthinkable that the 20-year civil\r\nwar that has already wreaked such irreparable losses on\r\nthe long-suffering Afghan people should turn into a new\r\n100-year war and continue into the third millennium.\r\nWe are deeply convinced that the only way to put an\r\nend to the long-drawn-out bloodshed in Afghanistan is\r\nthrough a political settlement to the conflict which would\r\nhave as its cornerstone the formation of a broad-based\r\nGovernment that reflects and protects the interests of all\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\npolitical, ethnic and religious groups and strata of Afghan\r\nsociety.\r\nWe are sure that the main thrust in any settlement to\r\nthe conflict in Afghanistan should be towards strengthening\r\nthe leading role of the United Nations as the key mediator\r\nbetween the parties in restoring peace and achieving\r\nnational reconciliation: the efforts of other international\r\norganizations, and of States, should complement and\r\nreinforce the work of the United Nations; they should not\r\nbe undertaken in isolation from it, much less run counter to\r\nit.\r\nIn the context of strengthening the central role played\r\nby the United Nations in coordinating international efforts\r\nwith regard to Afghanistan, the “six plus two” group of\r\nfriends and neighbours must redouble its efforts. We\r\nbelieve that the Security Council should once again very\r\nseriously review the situation in and around Afghanistan\r\nand that it should take action, including imposing sanctions\r\nagainst those who are violating Security Council and\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions.\r\nEngulfed in the flames of conflict, Afghanistan is the\r\nsource of the many dangers, destabilizing the situation in\r\nTajikistan, the whole of Central Asia and far beyond. In the\r\ncountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States,\r\nactive bilateral and multilateral cooperation is under way on\r\ncountering the penetration from Afghanistan, and the\r\nproliferation in our region, of militant Taliban ideology,\r\nweapons, crime, terrorism and various forms of extremism.\r\nI wish in particular to stress the seriousness of the\r\ndrug problem. Specifically, the protracted war in\r\nAfghanistan has turned that country into one of the world’s\r\nmain drug centres. The Taliban movement has chosen an\r\nextremely dangerous course in turning the territory under its\r\ncontrol into a gigantic drug production and distribution\r\nfactory and warehouse. Also, despite appeals from the\r\ninternational community, this factory of death continues to\r\nincrease its output.\r\nIn this context, I should like to remind the Assembly\r\nof the proposal I put forward at the twentieth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly in June 1998 (A/5-\r\n20/PV.2) to create a “cordon sanitaire” around Afghanistan\r\nthat would put a covering force along the drug routes out\r\nof that country. This idea was conceived because, given the\r\ncurrent social and economic conditions in our country, it is\r\nno simple matter for Tajikistan to guard its 1,500-kilometre\r\nfrontier with Afghanistan reliably. There is also a trend\r\ntowards using Tajikistan not only as a transit route for\r\ndrugs but also as a reprocessing station, and even towards\r\nexpanding the market with Tajik consumers, all part of\r\nthe plans of international criminal groups to destabilize\r\nthe situation in our country. Still, the bulk of the drugs\r\nfinding their way into our territory is still destined for\r\ntransshipment to other countries, primarily European ones\r\nthrough Russia and the Transcaucasus. In this sense, the\r\nTajik-Afghan border is the first line of defence for many\r\nother States, and the joint efforts of Tajik and Russian\r\nborder guards to plug the leaks in it are serving the\r\ninterests of a substantial part of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that our appeal has not\r\ngone unheeded and that over the past year there has been\r\na breakthrough in Tajikistan’s cooperation with the\r\nrelevant United Nations agencies, in particular the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP),\r\nwhose leadership’s support for the measures taken by the\r\nGovernment of Tajikistan to combat drug trafficking is\r\nbecoming ever more active.\r\nUnder the agreements and projects reached and\r\ndeveloped between the Government of Tajikistan and\r\nUNDCP, a number of specific activities are planned to\r\nincrease the anti-drug capabilities of law enforcement\r\nagencies and the military, in particular those operating in\r\nareas adjoining the Tajik-Afghan border. An anti-drug\r\nagency reporting directly to the President of the Republic\r\nhas been established. Cooperation between Tajikistan and\r\nUNDCP is a shining example of how efforts can be\r\ncombined in order to fight shoulder to shoulder against\r\none of the most terrible human evils. We are open to this\r\nkind of cooperation with all interested States, international\r\norganizations and institutions.\r\nThe world has recently been witness to brazen acts\r\nby international terrorists who are increasingly operating\r\nunder the banners of political extremism and religious\r\nfanaticism. Tajikistan shares the view that the fight\r\nagainst terrorism is one of the most pressing problems\r\nfacing mankind today. Suffice it to mention the situation\r\nin Afghanistan, which confirms that narco-dollars are\r\nhelping create an environment favourable to terrorism.\r\nWe condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations\r\nand deem it necessary to coordinate the actions of the\r\nentire world community to eradicate this scourge at the\r\nglobal, regional and national levels. We think it would be\r\nuseful to convene, under United Nations auspices, a year-\r\n2000 conference to decide on joint organized world action\r\nto combat terrorism; this will be discussed at the fifty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nTajikistan has consistently supported United Nations\r\nefforts in the sphere of environmental protection. We\r\nappreciate the growing United Nations attention to the\r\nserious ecological problems facing our country and other\r\nStates of Central Asia. We hope that the approach of the\r\nyear 2000, which the United Nations has declared the\r\nInternational Year of Mountains, will help mobilize the\r\ninternational community’s potential to help preserve\r\nbiodiversity and natural mountain ecological systems. This\r\nis of particular importance to Tajikistan as a predominantly\r\nmountainous country.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the leadership of the\r\nSecretariat, in particular Under-Secretary-General Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello, is showing increasing interest in\r\ncooperation with our country to ward off the threat of a\r\nmajor natural disaster in the Central Asian region related to\r\nthe problem of lake Sarez.\r\nIn this context, we believe it is time to focus world\r\nattention on the question of fresh water in all its aspects.\r\nTherefore, Tajikistan has proposed that 2003 be declared\r\nthe International Year of Water. This initiative is prompted\r\nby the menacing deterioration of a situation in which\r\nmillions of people lack access to clean water. It is well\r\nknown that because of water pollution half of the world’s\r\npopulation lives in unsanitary conditions; more than 5\r\nmillion people a year die, and more than 3 billion become\r\nill. As the population increases, the likelihood of “water\r\nwars” between States for sources of fresh water grows ever\r\ngreater. Issues of water and other challenges of the new age\r\nare thus directly linked to problems of security in the\r\ncontext of interdependence.\r\nIn addition to its humanitarian aspects, the problem of\r\nwater has other dimensions, in particular economic and\r\necological ones. Water is our common heritage, and it is\r\nnecessary to ensure that all States share in the responsibility\r\nto preserve it for the benefit of future generations.\r\nConstructive global cooperation could become a worthy\r\npolitical dimension of the twenty-first century, and could\r\nguarantee that this will never acquire a military aspect.\r\nWe hope that the international community will respond\r\nfavourably to our initiative on the resolution of water\r\nproblems, which are of crucial importance not only for\r\nTajikistan, which is rich in water resources, but also for the\r\nmajority of other States Members of the United Nations.\r\nIt is vital to repair broken links and to create a new\r\nmodel for relations, particularly in the area of transport and\r\ncommunication. Addressing that key task will to a large\r\nextent determine the development in the next millennium\r\nof all Central Asian States that lack an outlet to the sea;\r\nthese include Tajikistan.\r\nMy people has drawn new strength from peace and\r\nstability. The construction of a railroad, industrial\r\nenterprises and social infrastructure is now under way\r\nalong the ancient historic Great Silk Road, which runs\r\nthrough the territory of Tajikistan. This year we are\r\ncompleting construction of a transboundary route that will\r\ngive us access to the sea. That is our contribution to\r\nrestoring direct communication among individuals and\r\npeoples along an ancient route that in the Middle Ages\r\nserved as a bridge between East and West and that made\r\npossible dialogue among civilizations.\r\nWe expect that in the near future goods will flow\r\nalong this route in both directions. This will undoubtedly\r\nfoster better mutual understanding among all peoples of\r\nthe East and the West, and also will have a positive effect\r\non strengthening regional security and cooperation among\r\nneighbouring countries in Central Asia.\r\nExperience has shown that turning to one’s own\r\nroots is always a powerful means of spiritual therapy,\r\nespecially for those who have overcome the tragedy of a\r\nfratricidal war and are entering a period of active post-\r\nconflict reconstruction. Now we are at the stage of\r\nrenewal and of building a new democratic society, and we\r\nlook back once more at our long history. At a time when,\r\nwith active support from the United Nations, the process\r\nof national reconciliation is nearing its objective, our\r\ncountry is celebrating the 1,100th anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the State of the Samanids, which marked the\r\nbirth of Tajik statehood. We express our appreciation to\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization and to all the States and international\r\norganizations that responded to our appeal and have\r\nsupported efforts to undertake international activities\r\ndevoted to this momentous anniversary.\r\nThe age of the Samanids was not only a time of an\r\nunprecedented flourishing of science, culture and\r\nphilosophy and of the emergence of Tajik statehood. It\r\nwas also the time of the birth and blossoming of the\r\nmediaeval humanism that so enriched world civilization.\r\nAllow me to express the hope that in the third\r\nmillennium, now so close, the humanistic ideals will\r\nilluminate for the world community the arduous road to\r\nuniversal peace, sustainable development and peaceful\r\nconstruction.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Tajikistan\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President of the Republic of\r\nTajikistan, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I next give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Botswana, His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Lieutenant-General Mompati Merafhe.\r\nMr. Merafhe (Botswana): I take great pleasure in\r\ncongratulating you most warmly, my dear brother, on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fourth session. Your great country, Namibia, and its\r\nillustrious leader, President Sam Nujoma, have been very\r\ngenerous indeed in allowing us to benefit from the\r\nprodigious knowledge and experience you command on the\r\nworkings of the United Nations, having spent the better part\r\nof your life in this institution. We are confident that under\r\nyour seasoned leadership the fifty-fourth session will serve\r\nas a fitting climax to a tragic century. My delegation is\r\nready to render you all the support you will no doubt need\r\nin carrying out your onerous responsibilities.\r\nYour predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, has earned our\r\nadmiration and gratitude by the exemplary manner in which\r\nhe presided over the fifty-third session of the General\r\nAssembly. We thank his country, Uruguay, for allowing us\r\nto tap his wisdom and benefit from his leadership skills.\r\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his team\r\nin the Secretariat have continued to discharge their\r\nresponsibilities with unstinting devotion. The problems they\r\nhave to deal with, and/or seek solutions to, are enormous,\r\nand yet they remain undaunted. We owe them an immense\r\ndebt of gratitude.\r\nWe warmly welcome in our midst three new members\r\nof our Organization, Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga. We wish\r\nthem the best and assure them of our friendship and\r\nsolidarity.\r\nDespite the many horrors of the twilight of this\r\nturbulent century — the civil wars, the rampant terrorism\r\nin many places and other acts of savagery committed\r\nagainst millions of our fellow human beings all over the\r\nworld — we have made commendable progress in the\r\npast few years in the maintenance of global peace and\r\nsecurity and the consolidation of freedom and democracy.\r\nAn increasing number of the world\u0027s nations have\r\norganized successful elections in the past few years, many\r\nwith the help of the United Nations. In two weeks’ time,\r\nmy own country, Botswana, will for the seventh\r\nsuccessive time in a generation afford its citizens another\r\nopportunity to exercise their democratic right to choose\r\ntheir leaders.\r\nPolitical pluralism may not have taken root in all the\r\ncorners of the globe, but it has undoubtedly enthralled the\r\nimagination of all peoples yearning for freedom. It has\r\nbecome the weapon of choice, a powerful one at that,\r\nagainst tyranny. Democracy is, of course, not necessarily\r\na foolproof panacea against all the societal imperfections\r\nthat are our natural inheritance as human beings, but we\r\nbelieve that only in societies where the rights of all\r\ncitizens, their fundamental freedoms, their beliefs, their\r\nculture, are protected and allowed the fullest expression\r\npossible under the law, can peace prevail. Peace is a\r\nprerequisite for development, for sustainable development.\r\nAt independence in 1966 Botswana was regarded,\r\nand rightly so, as an abject basket case, the poorest of the\r\npoor of the emerging African nations. Our desire to be\r\nfree in those inauspicious economic and political\r\ncircumstances was derided by those who did not wish us\r\nwell as nothing more than a suicidal wish.\r\nToday, a mere generation later, my country prides\r\nitself on having one of the fastest growing economies in\r\nthe world, thanks to the peace and stability we have\r\nenjoyed since independence and the wise utilization of the\r\nfew resources with which our desert- scarred and drought-\r\nprone country is, thankfully, endowed.\r\nDemocracy has been a way of life and second nature\r\nto Botswana. We attribute our peace and stability to it.\r\nWe cannot, of course, forget the support we were given\r\nby the international community, particularly during the\r\nearly years of our independence.\r\nThis is why we welcome the end, at long last, of\r\nmilitary rule in Nigeria, a country whose importance to\r\nour continent and to the world at large cannot be gainsaid.\r\nA vibrant democracy in Nigeria will have a powerful\r\neffect not only on the west African region, but also on the\r\ncontinent as a whole.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nWe pledge our support to our Nigerian brothers and\r\nsisters in their struggle to nurture their democracy and to\r\nreconstruct their economy as well as to rehabilitate their\r\ninstitutions. We reiterate our aversion to coups and military\r\nrule, and laud the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nAlgiers decision to the effect that from now on those who\r\noverthrow Governments by means other than democratic\r\nelections will face isolation by our African community.\r\nWe welcome the signing in Togo recently of a peace\r\nagreement between the democratically elected Government\r\nof Sierra Leone and the rebels. We understand fully the\r\ncircumstances which compelled President Kabbah to sign\r\nthis peace agreement. We hope the agreement will bring\r\npeace to Sierra Leone. We urge the international\r\ncommunity to contribute generously to the rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction of that devastated country.\r\nThe Great Lakes region in Central Africa remains\r\nunstable, despite the signing recently of an Agreement to\r\nend the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe signing of the Agreement by its Government and its\r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) allies\r\nand the rebels is the first step in a difficult journey to peace\r\nin Central Africa.\r\nThe Agreement will, however, amount to nothing\r\nwithout the full support of the international community, in\r\nparticular that of the United Nations. We therefore urge the\r\nSecurity Council, in collaboration with the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), to become actively involved in the\r\nfull implementation of the Lusaka Agreement. Time is of\r\nthe essence.\r\nThe case of Angola is a very sad one. The departure\r\nof the United Nations from that war-ravaged country has\r\nleft a void, which has abetted one of the deadliest conflicts\r\nthat has ever afflicted Africa. In the absence of the United\r\nNations Angola Verification Mission, it is not possible to\r\nassess accurately the magnitude of the slaughter, the\r\nstarvation and the general mayhem caused by disease and\r\nlandmines in Angola. Nevertheless, we call upon the\r\ninternational community to intensify its efforts to end the\r\ntragedy, and we firmly believe that the tragedy can be\r\nended only by the full implementation of the Lusaka\r\nProtocol.\r\nWe further call upon those among us who continue to\r\ngive Savimbi’s rebellion sustenance to cease doing so. We\r\nmust all cooperate in ensuring that sanctions imposed\r\nagainst UNITA are effective.\r\nWe welcome, in this regard, the Security Council’s\r\nrecent establishment of panels to investigate violations of\r\nthe sanctions imposed against UNITA and to find\r\neffective ways of tightening them. It is our fervent hope\r\nthat the panels will not only be able to reveal the\r\nidentities of UNITA’s merchants of death, but will also\r\nadvise on how such violators of United Nations sanctions\r\ncould be deterred from defying the will of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe bloody war that has been raging between the\r\nEast African neighbours of Eritrea and Ethiopia may be\r\nexperiencing a lull as we meet here, but the fact, in our\r\nview, continues to be that this terrible war does not make\r\nsense. It is a war of brothers who, more than anyone else,\r\nshould have found it easy to sit down to discuss whatever\r\ndifferences might have arisen between them. We urge our\r\ntwo fellow African countries to embrace each other under\r\nthe OAU-brokered peace agreement and to make peace.\r\nThe question of Western Sahara has been on our\r\nagenda for too long. We urge the parties to redouble their\r\nefforts to conclude the identification process so that a\r\nreferendum can be held to decide the future of Western\r\nSahara once and for all, as called for by the OAU summit\r\nin Algiers.\r\nThe decision by Indonesia last year to allow the\r\npeople of East Timor to decide their future as they saw fit\r\nwas hailed by my country — and, I am sure, by many\r\nothers across the globe — as a momentous and wise one.\r\nWe lavished praise on Indonesia for this decision, fully\r\nconscious of the fact that it could not have been an easy\r\none to make.\r\nThe decision was quickly followed by the equally\r\nmomentous Agreement signed in May this year between\r\nthe Governments of Indonesia and Portugal, on one hand,\r\nand the United Nations, on the other, by which the people\r\nof East Timor were to decide their future through a\r\nreferendum. We were therefore disappointed, to put it as\r\nmildly as I can, by the tragic events that followed the\r\nholding of the referendum. The unleashing of militias on\r\nan innocent population — which had, with so much\r\ndignity and calm, voted in a referendum, as invited to do\r\nby Indonesia and the United Nations — deeply\r\ndisappointed Indonesia’s friends, including my own\r\ncountry. The destruction of Dili, the capital of East\r\nTimor, and its environs by the militias ennobled no one,\r\nincluding Indonesia, and deserves our censure.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nNow that the East Timorese have unequivocally stated\r\ntheir preference, which is independence, they should be\r\nafforded all the assistance they need to fulfil their national\r\naspirations without hindrance. Relations between the soon-\r\nto-be independent State of East Timor and the Republic of\r\nIndonesia should be cordial, and it is our hope that this will\r\nbe the case.\r\nThe resuscitation of the Wye River Memorandum and\r\nits implementation recently have given a needed fillip to the\r\npeace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\r\nThis gives us hope for the final phase of the negotiations\r\nthat have just begun. We urge the Israeli authorities and the\r\nPalestinians to persevere in the quest for peace in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nIn the past few years we have witnessed a\r\nproliferation of summits and major conferences aimed at\r\nbuilding a consensus on issues as diverse as women and\r\ndevelopment, youth, the environment, human rights,\r\npopulation and social development, human settlements,\r\neducation and health. We have also convened conferences\r\nto address the dangers of weapons of mass destruction and\r\nto intensify the campaign against landmines. If summitry\r\nand conferences alone were the solution to the world’s ills,\r\nour planet would by now have become a wonderful place\r\nto live. But this is not at all the case.\r\nThe cold war may have ended, but the old danger or\r\nthreat posed to the security of humankind by weapons of\r\nmass destruction remains. This is, as always, exacerbated\r\nby the build-up of conventional weapons beyond the\r\nlegitimate requirements of self-defence. Once again we urge\r\nthose concerned to show political will and commitment by\r\ntaking progressive measures to reduce nuclear weapons\r\nglobally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating them.\r\nThe adoption by the OAU of the Pelindaba Treaty and\r\nthe establishment of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free\r\nZone has demonstrated Africa’s commitment to an early\r\nconclusion of a legally binding instrument to avert the\r\ndangers posed by nuclear weapons. We will continue to\r\nwork assiduously with our partners in the developing world\r\nto pursue efforts aimed at ridding the southern hemisphere\r\nof all weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nLandmines have continued to maim and kill innocent\r\npeople. We must redouble our efforts to ban their\r\nproduction, stockpiling and use. We must all become party\r\nto the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction.\r\nThe challenges of development have become more\r\nformidable in today’s globalizing world. Increased\r\nintegration of markets and the rapid transfer of technology\r\nand of other innovations, as well as a wide array of\r\neconomic, social and political relationships, band our\r\nnations together and dictate a common destiny for our\r\npeoples. To survive the global competition, we in the\r\ndeveloping world must timeously and adequately respond\r\nto the opportunities and challenges facing us. In order to\r\ndo so we need to vigorously pursue strategies that will\r\nincrease trade prospects. We need also to raise the\r\nproductivity of our labour force and the quality of our\r\nhuman resources. It is crucial that in our pursuit of\r\nsustainable economic development, the basic tenets of\r\ndemocracy and good governance be upheld at all times\r\nand never be sacrificed.\r\nAt the Algiers summit of the OAU, our leaders had\r\nsubstantive discussions on how to harness the forces of\r\nglobalization for the benefit of the African region and for\r\nthe prosperity of our peoples. They solemnly committed\r\nthemselves to striving to ensure that globalization does\r\nnot transform Africa into a marginalized bystander. We\r\nrecognize, however, that to move forward, the entire\r\ninternational community has to be fully engaged. This\r\nwould by no means be merely a charitable act, but rather\r\nan investment in global peace and security.\r\nThe United Nations, as a universal forum, is\r\nuniquely placed to promote international cooperation by\r\naddressing the challenges of development in the context\r\nof interdependence. However, this can be achieved only\r\nif the United Nations is provided adequate financial\r\nresources. We note with deep concern that the last five\r\nyears have seen a steady decline in the resources of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the leading\r\noperational arm of the United Nations.\r\nFar too many of our people live in abject poverty.\r\nFar too many die of preventable diseases such as\r\ntuberculosis and malaria. Unemployment remains\r\npervasive, especially among the young.\r\nAfrica’s economic recovery and growth potential\r\ncontinue to be frustrated by the mounting foreign debt.\r\nDespite the numerous relief efforts, a durable solution to\r\nthe problem has remained unattainable. My delegation\r\nacknowledges the efforts being made through the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative in 1996.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nBut while the HIPC Initiative can be a catalyst in the\r\nsearch for the solution, it cannot be the solution itself. To\r\nreach the heart of the debt problem, it is imperative that the\r\ndebtors and the creditors acknowledge the seriousness of\r\nthe problem and work together to strike a compromise that\r\ncould yield long-term results.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts being made by the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the donor Governments to address\r\nthe debt problem, particularly the seminar recently held in\r\nthe Kenyan capital of Nairobi, chaired by the President of\r\nBotswana, Mr. Festus Mogae, whose results we hope will\r\nbe followed up. We still believe, however, that the\r\npermanent solution to Africa’s debt problem should go\r\nbeyond the mere rescheduling of the debt-payment period\r\nto outright cancellation and debt forgiveness.\r\nThe alarming rate of the spread of the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic is undoubtedly the most worrisome and urgent\r\nproblem facing sub-Saharan Africa, Botswana being one of\r\nthe hardest-hit countries. My Government is responding\r\nwith an aggressive national information and education\r\ncampaign to combat this destructive disease. The\r\nachievements made so far in the health sector and the\r\neconomy are in jeopardy.\r\nThe advancement of women and the elimination of all\r\nforms of discrimination and violence against them in many\r\nsocieties are yet to be achieved. Women and young girls\r\nare still subjected to all manner of brutalities.\r\nThe plight of millions of children who are conscripted\r\ninto armies in various parts of the world is an outrage. The\r\nimages of children being conscripted and trained to\r\nparticipate in senseless wars caused by the folly of adults\r\ndehumanizes us all. Everything must be done to discourage\r\nthis evil practice and to punish those who insist on\r\nperpetrating it. The Government of Botswana fully supports\r\nthe work of the Special Representative of General\r\nAssembly for Children and Armed Conflict and remains\r\nfully committed to upholding all the international legal\r\ninstruments on the rights of children. My delegation\r\nattaches great importance to these issues and urges the\r\ncommunity of nations here gathered to join their efforts in\r\nthe search for solutions to these socio-economic problems.\r\nIn turning now to the reform of the United Nations, let\r\nme briefly say the following: A wise man adapts to\r\ncircumstances, as water shapes itself to the vessel that\r\ncontains it. So says a Chinese proverb. That the United\r\nNations, particularly its Security Council, needs to adapt\r\nitself to the era in which it exists today, I think is\r\naxiomatic. The fact that the Security Council’s\r\nundemocratic composition is an insult to the\r\noverwhelming majority of the Members of this\r\nOrganization is also, I think, self-evident and recognized\r\nas such even by those who would, if allowed, keep this\r\nimportant organ as it is.\r\nAfrica, demands to be properly represented in the\r\nSecurity Council in both categories of representation. We\r\nwill never tire of insisting on our demand for three\r\nadditional non-permanent seats and at least two permanent\r\nseats.\r\nLet me conclude by once again wishing you well,\r\nSir, in your tenure of office as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. We can assure you\r\nthat our commitment to the United Nations remains as\r\nstrong as ever. This Organization, I am sure we all agree,\r\nis irreplaceable.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Worship of Bolivia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Javier Murillo de la Rocha.\r\nMr. Murillo de la Rocha (Bolivia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The men of the Andes scrutinized the skies to\r\ndecipher and predict the future. If they were looking at\r\nthe skies today, they might not manage to understand the\r\nmessage written there. On the one hand, there is the\r\npromise of unlimited prosperity, with man in apparent\r\ncontrol of nature and his environment, thanks to the\r\noutstanding strides made in knowledge, the tireless flow\r\nof data and financial resources, the almost genetic\r\ntransformation of the means of transportation and\r\ncommunication, the growing empire of freedom and the\r\nreaffirmation of democratic values on a global scale.\r\nOn the other hand, however, the new millennium is\r\narriving with disquieting signs. Financial crises are\r\nincreasingly frequent and ever more acute. The gaps\r\nbetween the haves and the have-nots are widening.\r\nConfusions, fear and uncertainty prevail over a large part\r\nof the planet. Thus must one see both sides of\r\nglobalization: one of promise, the other of threat.\r\nThe effects of the two aspects of the process are felt\r\nin Latin America with singular intensity. The crisis of the\r\nfinancial markets and the constant decline in commodity\r\nprices have struck at the heart of the economies of our\r\nsocieties and subjected them to pressure, in some cases\r\nintolerable. Nothing seems to be in its place and few dare\r\nto anticipate the future.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nNevertheless, the men and women of Latin America\r\nhave a right to keep hoping. My own country maintains a\r\nvery cautious optimism. Not many years ago, Bolivia felt\r\nwith particular intensity the tragedy that is affecting other\r\nnations of Latin America. Drug trafficking, the external\r\ndebt, the collapse of mining and the crisis in the political\r\nsystem all conspired to create a picture of confusion and\r\nanguish that seemed to be insurmountable.\r\nWhat we have done since then belongs to history. I\r\nshall summarize it here for no other reason than to share\r\nour experience, because our task, far from over, seems to\r\nhave only just begun.\r\nTired of sterile and debilitating political confrontation,\r\nBolivians decided to take the road of cooperation and\r\ndialogue. The coalition Governments on which the political\r\nsystem has been based and nurtured since the early 1980s\r\nproved the intelligence of an old constitutional norm, but\r\nthey also showed that the letter of the law is worthless if it\r\nis not steeped in the spirit in which it was written. It was\r\nin the spirit of questing for consensus that the political\r\nConstitution was reaffirmed, the true independence of the\r\nNational Electoral Tribunal was guaranteed and the\r\nConstitutional Tribunal, the Judicial Council and the Office\r\nof Ombudsman were established. Lastly, institutions and\r\nsocial organizations were incorporated into the discussions\r\nof the major problems affecting the nation in a dialogue\r\nthat President Hugo Banzer, at the start of his mandate,\r\ncalled on to support the Government’s work with a broad\r\ncivic consensus.\r\nMr. Morel (Seychelles), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe first conclusion that can be drawn from this rapid\r\nsummary is that the economy cannot be modernized without\r\na solid base of political reform. Indeed, it was on that\r\npolitical foundation, on the basis of the will of the people\r\nrepresented by the parties, that we were able to make\r\nstrides in modernizing and opening up the Bolivian\r\neconomy. We controlled inflation. We renegotiated and\r\nreduced the external debt burden. We transferred control of\r\npublic companies to the private sector, and we created the\r\nconditions for the sustained development of Bolivia.\r\nHowever, when we seemed to be achieving the\r\nimpetus required to launch that development, the Asian\r\ncrisis and its effects on our region abruptly slowed down\r\nthe rate of our growth, after almost a decade of a modest\r\nincrease in per capita income. The storm will pass,\r\nundoubtedly, but I cannot deny that the legitimate\r\nexpectations for development have been affected by this\r\nsudden and unexpected return of old fears.\r\nWe know how Bolivia managed to control its\r\neconomy, and you have already heard the figures that\r\nshow how the reserves grew, the way the fiscal deficit\r\nwas reduced and the mechanism that enabled us to go\r\nfrom an inflation rate of more than 20,000 per cent per\r\nyear in 1984 to 4 per cent in 1998, just to mention the\r\nmost significant data.\r\nBut there are other things that are sometimes\r\noverlooked. One is that the process of structural\r\ntransformation requires perseverance and time. Bolivia\r\npersevered, perhaps because it had had difficult\r\nexperiences. Nevertheless, more than a decade was\r\nnecessary to come out of that emergency situation. The\r\nother element is that what was built in years of sacrifice\r\ncan be lost in a moment of inattention or rashness.\r\nWith all the limits and difficulties that were involved\r\nin the transition process that began in the early 1980s, the\r\nliving conditions of Bolivians improved significantly, as\r\nwe see in the data that was published in the last United\r\nNations Human Development Report. Public spending on\r\neducation increased from 2.1 per cent of the gross\r\ndomestic product in 1985 to 5.6 per cent in 1997.\r\nIlliteracy in young people under 15 years of age was\r\npractically eradicated. Between 1976 and 1997 the\r\nmortality rate of breast-fed infants dropped from 144 of\r\nevery 1,000 live births to 69, and life expectancy grew\r\nfrom 45 to 61 years of age in the same period. However,\r\nwe have to say that the growth rate is still insufficient and\r\nunfair.\r\nAs in other countries, development was focused on\r\na particular segment of Bolivian society. Therefore the\r\nfight against poverty is the main task of the Government\r\nof President Bánzer. Thus the cornerstone of that strategy\r\nis the active participation of the very sectors that had\r\nbeen ignored in choosing ways and means through an\r\nintelligent and active decentralization mechanism. There\r\nis full awareness that access to the means of production\r\nshould be added to the effort that has already been made\r\nin allocating resources to social, educational and health\r\npolicies.\r\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, when we began the\r\ndemocratic stage I have just described, illicit drug\r\ntrafficking cast a long shadow over development in\r\nBolivia. At the critical moment of the collapse of tin\r\nmining, the cultivation of coca leaves employed thousands\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nof families of unemployed workers and became a major\r\nsource of income for the Bolivian economy. Even worse,\r\nhowever, was that the risk that drug trafficking would\r\ninfiltrate the economic and political system became a real\r\npossibility.\r\nThe situation today is radically different. Bolivia will\r\nemerge from this coca-cocaine cycle in the next three years,\r\nwithin the timetable President Bánzer set for himself when\r\nhis mandate began in the face of the scepticism of all,\r\nfriends and critics.\r\nIn August 1997, the land occupied by coca plantations\r\nexceeded 40,000 hectares. In the 25 months of the\r\nimplementation of the Dignity Plan, 25,000 hectares have\r\nbeen removed and the remaining 15,000 will be eliminated\r\nin the time-frame planned, or earlier. The undeniable\r\nsuccess of that plan can be explained by the conviction of\r\nthe Bolivian people that the drug-trafficking cancer had to\r\nbe eradicated from the body of national society.\r\nPresident Bánzer had the merit of interpreting that\r\ndecision and of making it concrete, making it an irrevocable\r\nState policy. He applied it without altering even a\r\nmillimetre of the structure of democratic institutions and\r\nwithout breaking the spirit of civil peace and security which\r\nmy country fortunately enjoys. The occasional moments of\r\nfriction that arose in the beginning were brought under\r\ncontrol, and the police forces were required to carry out\r\ntheir tasks with the utmost respect for human rights.\r\nThe international community has pointed to the\r\nBolivian strategy as one of the most successful and\r\npragmatic ones of the continent. I must say, nevertheless,\r\nthat the task has not been completed, and its support is\r\nessential to create sources of work and productive and legal\r\ndevelopment opportunities for the farmers who are no\r\nlonger involved in the cultivation of coca leaves. Only in\r\nthat way can we claim victory.\r\nThe century ends in Latin America with the good\r\nnews of the peace agreement between Ecuador and Peru\r\nand the announcement that very soon Chile and Peru will\r\nend years of patient work in order to resolve the matters\r\npending from the 1929 treaty. These are very important\r\nevents, to which we must add the treaties through which\r\nArgentina and Chile resolved their disputes along their\r\nextensive border. In that way, the countries of this part of\r\nSouth America altered the legacy of confrontation and\r\nconflict that men of other times and circumstances left\r\nbehind.\r\nHowever, there is still an open wound in the\r\nconscience of America, the injustice of the landlocked\r\nsituation of Bolivia, which has existed for more than a\r\ncentury. Members know very well how Bolivia lost the\r\nextensive coastal strip that it enjoyed when it achieved\r\nindependence and the enormous cost that loss represents\r\nfor the development of my country. It is, undoubtedly,\r\none of the main reasons for Bolivia’s backwardness, as I\r\npointed out in my message last year with more detail and\r\nprecision.\r\nI can affirm that my country has made all possible\r\nefforts to find a friendly and peaceful solution to its\r\nlandlocked situation. We have left no stone unturned in\r\nevery forum in which Bolivia participates. We uphold our\r\nrequest for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean in\r\nirrefutable legal, historical, political and economic\r\narguments.\r\nWith ever greater dedication and perseverance, my\r\ncountry sought contact and direct negotiations with Chile\r\nin order to find within dialogue a friendly solution that\r\nwould meet the needs of both countries. In the twentieth\r\ncentury alone, we began at least five bilateral\r\nnegotiations. Unfortunately, none were successful, for\r\nreasons which I do not have to point out now. I mention\r\nthem only to show that this path has been explored with\r\nthe support of countries friendly to Chile and Bolivia, and\r\nthat Chile formally agreed to grant Bolivia a sovereign\r\noutlet to the Pacific Ocean and that route is known.\r\nNow, at the threshold of a new century, Bolivia has\r\ndecided to insist on calling for direct dialogue, a dialogue\r\nwhich would encompass all the themes in our relations\r\nwith Chile. I trust that very soon we will define, with\r\nChancellor Valdés, the terms of that dialogue, which, in\r\nmy opinion, should encompass the complete range of our\r\nrelations and identify ways for the economic, cultural and\r\npolitical cooperation which will unite our nations when\r\nBolivia recovers its maritime attribute. The experience of\r\nthe past does not discourage us. New times, new men,\r\nnew realities must bring along with them new solutions.\r\nThat is our hope.\r\nThe United Nations system, one of the most\r\nimportant creations of the century, is at the threshold of\r\na new millennium and is subjected to many tensions. Its\r\nfunction as a channel for official development assistance\r\nhas remained constrained by the privatization of financing\r\nand technology groups which go from advanced countries\r\nto emerging markets.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nIts role as a forum for negotiation and dialogue\r\nbetween the North and the South and between developed\r\ncountries and developing countries is being disregarded for\r\na new and different structure which revolves around\r\nessentially technical mechanisms, such as the International\r\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade\r\nOrganization, in which negotiations are different from what\r\nthey were in the past. Its very role as a collective security\r\nsystem sometimes seems at times eclipsed by the unilateral\r\naction of countries or groups of countries intent on making\r\ntheir agenda prevail over the world mechanism.\r\nI mention these changes here simply as an argument\r\nin support of the need to think about the reform of the\r\nsystem, as a process of creating it anew, and not simply an\r\nattempt to stop the clock because of a nostalgic vision. I am\r\nconvinced that this is the view of the statesmen who\r\nrepresent the United Nations and whose patient yet\r\npersevering work will bear fruit sooner rather than later.\r\nBolivia, of course, as always, is ready to make its firm\r\ncontribution.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of Malawi,\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Brown Mpinganjira.\r\nMr. Mpinganjira (Malawi): The President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly has assumed the mantle of leadership at\r\na critical time, as we are about to enter the new\r\nmillennium. We are about to leave a century which has\r\nrevealed positive and negative aspects of the human\r\nexperience. On the negative side, the century has been\r\ncharacterized by colonialism, armed conflict, racism and\r\nracial discrimination, apartheid, dictatorship, the Holocaust,\r\ngenocide, ethnic cleansing, religious intolerance and other\r\nforms of evil. In their wake many people, particularly\r\nwomen and children, have lost their lives and have been\r\nmaimed, traumatized, dehumanized, displaced and forced to\r\nseek refuge. Poverty and underdevelopment have wreaked\r\nhavoc.\r\nOn the other hand, humankind has demonstrated a\r\nsense of magnanimity in overcoming suffering and despair.\r\nWe have made very strong efforts to wipe out slavery,\r\ncolonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid. We have\r\nstriven, through multilateral institutions such as the United\r\nNations, to promote the togetherness of humankind and\r\nimprove the well-being of all. We realize, however, that\r\nthere is a lot more that can and must be done.\r\nAs this century comes to a close, Mr. Gurirab’s\r\nleadership as President of the General Assembly, and his\r\ncountry, Namibia, represent a beacon of hope for the\r\nfuture. His qualities as an outstanding diplomat, freedom\r\nfighter and consensus-builder are all well known to us.\r\nMy delegation wishes him well as he discharges his\r\nheavy responsibilities and leads this esteemed\r\nOrganization into the new millennium.\r\nIn today’s globalized world, the challenges are many\r\nand the opportunities are manifold. With the same spirit\r\nthat has enabled us to surmount hurdles in the past,\r\ntogether we can make the twenty-first century a century\r\nfor the prosperity of all. The groundwork, the foundation\r\nfor all this, exists. To give credit where it is due, despite\r\nmany weaknesses, humankind has never been wanting in\r\nideas. The standard-setting strides and intellectual\r\ninnovations of this century, particularly since the\r\nformation of the United Nations, could have been more\r\nappreciated if only an extra effort had been exerted\r\ntowards implementation. Indeed, the twenty-first century\r\nshould focus on the implementation and concretization of\r\nthe ideas that have made this century worthwhile.\r\nThe consolidation of human rights, good governance\r\nand human development seems to my delegation a useful\r\npoint of departure. The country that I represent was for a\r\nlong time under a dictatorship. The people of Malawi\r\nsuffered and know what it means to be deprived of\r\nfreedom. They are well aware of the impact that denial of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms has on\r\ngovernance and development. To us the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are\r\nnot optional, but essential prerequisites for the well-being\r\nof humankind.\r\nHuman rights are universal and indivisible. They are\r\ninalienable. When the people of Malawi went to the polls\r\nin June this year, in the second democratic elections, we\r\nconfirmed our desire to strengthen further the\r\ndemocratization processes that we started in 1994. The\r\nentrenchment of democracy in Malawi has given our\r\npeople an opportunity to foster unity and common\r\nunderstanding. We now have an environment conducive\r\nto exploiting our full potential and maximizing our\r\ncontributions to the developmental efforts that the\r\nGovernment is pursuing. We wish for all people of the\r\nworld, regardless of their origin, the same opportunity to\r\nenjoy the rights and freedoms that Malawians are proud\r\nto enjoy today.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nUnfortunately, the situation globally does not give\r\ncause for optimism, and there is no room for complacency.\r\nInasmuch as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights set\r\nforth the yardstick of common achievement and has given\r\nrise to numerous subject-specific binding instruments, every\r\neffort should be made to assure their effective\r\nimplementation. The rights of women, children and the\r\ndisadvantaged, especially, must be given their fullest\r\npractical meaning.\r\nAs we commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the\r\nadoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\r\nof Discrimination against Women, we should reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to take all practical measures to eliminate\r\ndiscrimination against women and review all practices that\r\nimpede the mainstreaming of gender in all our\r\ndevelopmental endeavours. Malawi welcomes and looks\r\nforward to the review conference of the Beijing Platform\r\nfor Action next year. It is our belief that gender equality,\r\ndevelopment and peace in the twenty-first century are\r\nachievable.\r\nAlmost 10 years ago, world leaders assembled in this\r\nvery Hall for the World Summit for Children. They made\r\ngroundbreaking commitments to reach certain goals by the\r\nyear 2000. The State of the World’s Children 1999 report,\r\nhowever, indicates that the benchmarks set are far from\r\nbeing realized. Meeting the commitments of the 1990\r\nSummit remains one of the challenges that we all face at\r\nthe beginning of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe continued recruitment and use of children as\r\nsoldiers in most of today’s conflicts is a major source of\r\nworry. The use of children as child labourers and in\r\nprostitution is also cause for serious concern. We remain\r\nconvinced that investing in children means a secure future\r\nfor us all.\r\nMany other conferences have also taken place —\r\nparticularly during this last decade — including those in\r\nParis, Vienna, Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, Cairo and\r\nCopenhagen. In all these conferences, the protection of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms has been a\r\nrecurrent and cross-cutting theme. Malawi fully supports the\r\noutcome of these conferences.\r\nThe time has come to make good the pledges that we\r\nmade: personal liberties for all, particularly women and\r\nchildren; social development, especially for the least\r\ndeveloped countries; protection of the environment;\r\nprovision of food and shelter; jobs and income; education\r\nfor all; and secure health, including reproductive rights,\r\nremain the core of human security. Indeed, these\r\nconferences have brought to the fore the interlinkages\r\nbetween the protection of human rights and the questions\r\nof good governance and development. Quite often, they\r\nseem to give rise to conflicting interests; we aspire to a\r\nrights-based approach to development, yet the facts are\r\nstark: how can our countries, particularly those with\r\nfragile economies such as our own, ensure strong public\r\npolicies aimed at promoting food security, for example,\r\nwhen the very interventions intended to provide incentives\r\nfor local production and distribution are put into question\r\nby our efforts to spur economic growth? How do we give\r\npriority to public expenditures for basic social services\r\nsuch as education, health and water when these are the\r\nfirst to be cut in an effort to meet structural adjustment\r\nconditionalities and the demands of debt servicing?\r\nThe challenge for us all is to minimize conflict and\r\naim to strike an appropriate balance to ensure proper\r\nservices that are human-rights compliant. Malawi supports\r\nthe statement in the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme Human Development Report 1999, to the\r\neffect that national and global governance must be\r\nreinvented with human development and equity at their\r\ncore. With our concerted efforts, this is achievable. My\r\ndelegation particularly welcomes the positive\r\ndevelopments that are taking place in our beloved\r\ncontinent, Africa. As democracy blossoms, we are\r\nincreasingly witnessing efforts to harness progress in\r\nhuman development: Africa’s renaissance is no longer a\r\nslogan, but a realistic achievement for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nIn Malawi, we remain committed to strengthening\r\ngood governance based on the principles of accountability\r\nand transparency. Attention is also given to addressing\r\ncorruption and strengthening public sector administration,\r\nin particular enhancing local participation in decision-\r\nmaking processes. We will continue to carry out the\r\nnecessary economic and fiscal reforms.\r\nDespite unpalatable structural adjustment\r\nconditionalities and the impact of debt servicing, the\r\nGovernment continues to give top priority to the provision\r\nof basic social services, particularly in education, health,\r\nwater supply, community development and road\r\ninfrastructure. The Poverty Alleviation Programme and\r\nthe Malawi Social Action Fund seek to empower the\r\npopulace so that they can contribute more positively to\r\ndevelopment. Free primary education for all was\r\nintroduced by the Government to ensure that Malawian\r\nchildren, who hold the future of the country in their\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nhands, are given equal opportunities to grow into productive\r\nand responsible adults.\r\nIn the health and water sectors, true to the slogan\r\n“healthy people make a healthy nation”, the Government is\r\nestablishing more health centres in many parts of rural\r\nMalawi: the Bakili Muluzi health initiative, which aims to\r\nbring medical services right to the people, was introduced\r\nrecently. We are also making remarkable progress in\r\nbringing clean and safe water to all rural areas.\r\nIn order to respond fully to the HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\nin the country, the Government, in close cooperation with\r\ncivil society, has embarked on highly publicized awareness\r\ncampaigns which we hope will contribute to changing\r\nbehavioural patterns. We appeal for more resources:\r\nadditional funding for research is indeed imperative.\r\nMeanwhile, for those already afflicted, it is important for\r\nthe drugs that are available now to be made more\r\naffordable for the majority of our poor.\r\nIn agriculture, the mainstay of Malawi, the priority is\r\nto achieve food self-sufficiency. In this connection, we have\r\nembarked on irrigation programmes to supplement rain-fed\r\nagricultural production.\r\nThe Malawian examples are typical of the important\r\nsteps that Africa is taking, which are positive signs of\r\nrenewal. Africa, however, needs the world in the same way\r\nthat the world needs Africa. Africa needs a partnership, one\r\nthat is shared and mutually beneficial — a genuine\r\npartnership. We realize that the primary responsibility for\r\nAfrican development rests with African countries\r\nthemselves. It is nevertheless important for African\r\ncountries to be given meaningful assistance to enable them\r\nto embark on sound economic development. The Cairo\r\nAgenda for Action adopted by the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) in 1995 is an important blueprint for African\r\neconomic development: it sets out the broad priority areas\r\nrequiring specific attention. Numerous other initiatives have\r\nhighlighted the need to help the development of Africa. The\r\nchallenge as we approach the twenty-first century should\r\nand must be to harmonize these initiatives with a view to\r\nadopting action-oriented measures for urgent\r\nimplementation.\r\nWhatever interventions are made, it has become\r\nincreasingly clear that a meaningful transformation of\r\nAfrican economies, even after introducing all the necessary\r\ndomestic, economic and market reforms, cannot be\r\nsustained without complementary improvements in trade\r\nflows, improvements in financial resource flows — whether\r\nthrough increased official development assistance, debt\r\nrelief or forgiveness, or foreign direct investment — and\r\nsupport for regional cooperation. All this must be done in\r\na conducive, secure and predictable environment. Indeed,\r\nin the globalized economy of today what happens in one\r\npart of the globe has ripple effects and impacts\r\ndevelopments elsewhere: the Asian financial crisis and the\r\nrecent sale of gold are clear examples of this\r\nphenomenon.\r\nWe must act now if we are to avert a human\r\ncatastrophe in the near future. In particular, my delegation\r\nwishes to single out the imperative need for the\r\ninternational community to address the problem of debt.\r\nAlthough encouraged by the positive responses in recent\r\nmonths, we renew the appeal for debt forgiveness which\r\nwe made in this Hall several years ago. The current ratio\r\nof external debt to gross national product, 89 per cent for\r\nmy country, is causing enormous economic stress and\r\nhardship, particularly for women and children. The\r\nsituation does not augur well for the future, and is having\r\nadverse effects on the Government’s poverty eradication\r\npolicy; also, the gains we have made politically through\r\ndemocratization and good governance will become\r\nmeaningless without economic development.\r\nMalawi is not alone in this predicament. Many other\r\ncountries find themselves in similar conditions, where\r\npoverty is rampant and the disparities between the haves\r\nand the have-nots are widening.\r\nOne of the major issues on which people look up to\r\nthe United Nations is because of its concern for national\r\nidentity. It is in this spirit that Malawi reiterates its\r\nconviction that the question of participation by the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations deserves consideration on the basis of\r\nrespect for the principle of universality and the sovereign\r\nequality of States. The Republic of China, a democratic\r\ncountry of over 21 million people, is a reality and cannot\r\nbe ignored. It cannot be wished away. Malawi believes\r\nthat readmission of the Republic of China to the United\r\nNations and to all its specialized agencies would be an\r\nimportant factor for peace, stability and international\r\ncooperation.\r\nNo progress towards improved human development\r\ncan be sustained without peace and stability. As we\r\ncommemorate the centennial of the first Peace Conference\r\nat The Hague, my delegation wishes to reiterate the\r\nimportance that it attaches to the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes and respect for international law, including\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ninternational humanitarian law. In this connection, Malawi\r\nalso welcomes the adoption of the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court last year. We have already\r\nsigned the Statute, and steps are under way to assure\r\nratification without delay. We are confident that as the next\r\ncentury nears, the early entry into force of the Rome Statute\r\nwill fortify our resolve to bring an end to impunity.\r\nMuch as the Rome Statute will go a long way in\r\nbringing to book those perpetrators of heinous crimes, it is\r\nincumbent upon us all to rid the earth of all weapons of\r\nmass destruction. The Review Conference of the States\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) next year affords us an opportunity to\r\nmake greater strides in the area of nuclear disarmament. It\r\nis worth recalling the words of Albert Einstein: “Peace\r\ncannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by\r\nunderstanding.” Indeed, peace cannot be sustained by a\r\nthreat of use of force. So long as the spectre of a nuclear\r\nwar exists, the world will never be at peace with itself. We\r\nurge all countries to sign and ratify the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and those countries that have\r\nnuclear weapons to destroy them in order to finally realize\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament and a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree world.\r\nWe also appeal to those countries that have not yet\r\ndone so to become party to the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention and the anti-personnel landmines Convention.\r\nWe equally enjoin current efforts to address the\r\nproliferation of small arms. In our region, this problem has\r\nassumed frightening proportions, as robberies and thefts\r\nhave become more and more violent. Urgent action needs\r\nto be taken to tackle this problem resolutely. In particular,\r\nMalawi supports a moratorium on the import, export and\r\nmanufacture of small arms and light weapons. We must\r\nalso look for ways of stopping their flow. This Organization\r\nshould prevail upon the manufacturers of these weapons to\r\nstop the illegal export of their deadly merchandise to\r\nAfrica. Let them stop manufacturing and exporting these\r\nweapons to Africa. That is the bottom line. There is no\r\npoint in inviting us to conferences when, under cover of\r\ndarkness, the manufacturers of those small arms continue\r\nexporting them to Africa.\r\nThe biggest threat to international peace and security\r\nremains humankind. As events in Kosovo, Sierra Leone,\r\nAngola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nAfghanistan, Somalia, Rwanda, Guinea-Bissau, the Middle\r\nEast, the Korean peninsula and many other parts of the\r\nglobe, including, most recently, East Timor, have shown,\r\nhuman beings continue to be the main centre of activity\r\nwhere armed conflict, tensions and the quest for power\r\nexist.\r\nAs the Constitution of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) reminds us, “wars begin in the minds of\r\nmen”. Only human beings can control their own destiny.\r\nJust as those who sat at The Hague Conference 100 years\r\nago were, we are capable of renouncing violence and of\r\nresolving all disputes through peaceful means. In this\r\nregard, we would like to welcome the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Summit declaration that the year\r\n2000 will be a year of peace, security and solidarity in\r\nAfrica. We remain optimistic that the Israelis and the\r\nPalestinians; the people of Western Sahara and East\r\nTimor; our brothers and sisters in Angola, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Somalia; and\r\nmany others whose rights and liberties remain unprotected\r\nwill finally find peace. We can together provide a\r\nconducive atmosphere for the provision of all other basic\r\nneeds that have an impact on peace and security.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, the United Nations\r\nremains a singular Organization that is capable of\r\nconsolidating peace and promoting sustainable human\r\ndevelopment. The relevance of the United Nations in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security has\r\nbecome even more pronounced in recent years. My\r\ndelegation wishes to pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan for providing leadership and a renewed sense of\r\nmission to the Organization. Reform of the Organization\r\nsystemwide and of its funds, programmes and specialized\r\nagencies has rekindled hopes for a secure world. Effective\r\ncollaboration by all United Nations bodies, each focusing\r\non areas of expertise, is a sure way of reaching our goals\r\nand realizing our aspirations.\r\nThe task that remains is to make the United Nations\r\nmore responsive to the responsibilities ahead — the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. For six years now\r\nwe have been talking about reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, but without any breakthrough. It is imperative\r\nthat the Security Council be made more democratic,\r\ntransparent and accountable. Representation of developing\r\ncountries in the permanent category is necessary in order\r\nto ensure the continued legitimacy of, and respect for, the\r\nCouncil’s decisions. The United Nations must be properly\r\nresourced in order for it to carry out adequately its noble\r\nactivities.\r\nSimilarly, the United Nations cannot remain aloof to\r\nthe requirements of civil society. Increased cooperation\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nbetween the Organization and civil society, including the\r\nprivate sector, can only make the Organization stronger.\r\nThe important role played in particular by non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the adoption of the Rome\r\nStatute and the anti-personnel landmines Convention must\r\nbe acknowledged and ways explored to enhance it. We\r\nbelieve that increased contacts between the Organization\r\nand civil society will ensure the continued relevance of the\r\nOrganization in the twenty-first century.\r\nAs the Organization prepares for the Millennium\r\nAssembly next year under your leadership, the role of civil\r\nsociety in the consolidation of human rights, good\r\ngovernance and human development might be a subject that\r\nshould be given in-depth consideration within the context\r\nof the overall theme of the United Nations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nFinally, Malawi would like to congratulate the three\r\nnew Members of the United Nations: the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nWe welcome them to the United Nations family.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Bahamas, Her Excellency The\r\nHonourable Janet Bostwick.\r\nMs. Bostwick (Bahamas): The Bahamas shares the\r\nconfidence that the international community has placed in\r\nyou, Sir, as the envoy of Namibia and of the continent of\r\nAfrica to preside over this fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the last in this twentieth century. My\r\ndelegation congratulates you and pledges its full support as\r\nyou guide our deliberations at this critical juncture.\r\nMy delegation’s congratulations are also extended to\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, who represented our Latin American\r\nand Caribbean region as President of the fifty-third session.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations for his leadership of this\r\nhighly complex Organization on which rest the hopes and\r\naspirations of the world’s peoples and which is our best\r\nprospect for a stable world.\r\nI am pleased on this occasion to warmly welcome the\r\nKingdom of Tonga, the Republic of Kiribati and the\r\nRepublic of Nauru, the United Nations newest Member\r\nStates, to this community of nations. These countries add to\r\nthe growing number of small island developing States in the\r\nUnited Nations and underscore the need for the\r\nOrganization to increase its efforts in support of this\r\nimportant constituency.\r\nThe United Nations was created with a mandate to\r\nwork collectively for a better world, and since its\r\ninception it has contributed to positive developments in\r\nthe global arena. However, significant challenges persist.\r\nThe agenda of the fifty-fourth session shows that even as\r\nsome progress has been made, we will continue at this\r\nsession to grapple with many of the thorny issues that\r\nhave preoccupied the international community over the\r\ndecades. At the same time, new challenges will have to\r\nbe addressed.\r\nRecent events in Europe and elsewhere in the world,\r\nspawned by internal conflict, have raised questions as to\r\nwhether States fractured by ethnic, religious and other\r\nstrife could build national identities to span these divides.\r\nAt the same time, they remind us that the greatest care\r\nmust be taken in making exceptions to the general\r\nprinciple of non-intervention in the internal affairs of\r\nother States. The Bahamas believes that this principle\r\nremains an important safeguard for international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe Bahamas accepts that internal conflicts create\r\nsituations in which the Security Council should act, in\r\naccordance with the Charter. However, we believe that\r\nwhenever the United Nations responds to internal\r\nconflicts and threats to regional stability, it must do so\r\nwith one and the same degree of urgency, with adequate\r\nresources and with consistency. It is with these\r\nconsiderations in mind that the Bahamas supports United\r\nNations efforts to bring peace and stability to areas of\r\nconflict in all regions of the world.\r\nRecent United Nations peace initiatives give us hope\r\nthat long-standing and seemingly intractable problems\r\nmay have solutions. Indeed, the Bahamas is encouraged\r\nby developments in the Middle East, particularly the\r\nsigning this month of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.\r\nWe see these developments as having the potential to end\r\ndecades of conflict in that troubled region. If enlightened\r\nself-interest were to prevail in long-standing conflicts\r\nelsewhere in Africa, Asia and Latin America, they too\r\ncould be resolved. Global attention could then be turned\r\ntowards development and human betterment, as envisaged\r\nin the Charter.\r\nGlobalization and trade liberalization are gaining\r\ncurrency as means of promoting accelerated development\r\nand opening opportunities to bridge the gap between rich\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nand poor. However, concerns are being expressed that the\r\nrules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its\r\ndispute settlement mechanisms put the interests of the\r\nstrong ahead of the interests of the weak. Indeed, the\r\nanticipated benefits of free trade give little comfort to\r\nCaribbean States and farmers dependent as they are on\r\nbananas for their foreign exchange earnings and their very\r\nlivelihood. Where preferential treatment is removed before\r\nCaribbean countries can restructure their economies, severe\r\nhardship results. We therefore believe that all concerned\r\nmust make an effort to find a solution to the banana\r\nproblem.\r\nWe see the new round of WTO negotiations scheduled\r\nto begin in Seattle in November as an invaluable\r\nopportunity for developing countries to have their concerns\r\nincorporated into the discussions. The Bahamas is currently\r\ngiving consideration to acquiring observer status in the\r\nWTO. It fully intends to follow the multilateral negotiating\r\nprocess and to bring its concerns to the table, particularly\r\nin the areas of trade in services and differential treatment\r\nfor small economies.\r\nGrowth in the economy of the Bahamas is in part\r\nattributable to the services it offers as an offshore financial\r\ncentre. The Bahamas is concerned about the action taken\r\nwithin the international community to inhibit or prevent the\r\nuse of offshore centres and to label them, impertinently, as\r\n“harmful” tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, there is a tendency\r\nto treat all offshore jurisdictions as a homogenous group,\r\nwhich they are most definitely not.\r\nThe Bahamas had the opportunity to address the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\r\non harmful tax practices in August this year in Paris. We\r\nemphasized there that strict regulations and appropriate\r\nlegislation, specifically formulated to counter money\r\nlaundering and other illegal activities, govern financial\r\ninstitutions in the Bahamas. The Bahamas is committed to\r\nworking with all concerned to address these and related\r\nissues.\r\nIn May this year, it was reported to our Parliament\r\nthat the economy of the Bahamas was experiencing a\r\nperiod of dynamism. In 1998, our economy grew some 3\r\nper cent, the unemployment rate was 7.8 per cent and net\r\nforeign investment inflows amounted to $491 million. But\r\non 14 September 1999, hurricane Floyd struck the\r\nBahamas, and the entire archipelago felt its impact.\r\nSignificant damage was done to the environment,\r\ninfrastructure and property. The full implications for the\r\neconomy of our country of the relief, recovery and\r\nreconstruction efforts have yet to be calculated.\r\nWhat happened in the Bahamas underscores the\r\ncontinuing validity of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, adopted in 1994. We cannot help but\r\nemphasize — as so many States did at the recently\r\nconcluded twenty-second special session — how\r\nimperative it therefore remains for the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action to be implemented. It is in this\r\ncontext that we urge renewed commitment on the part of\r\nall to the search for consensus on the draft resolution on\r\nthe recognition of the Caribbean Sea as a special area in\r\nthe context of sustainable development.\r\nTogether with our Caribbean Community sister\r\nStates, the Bahamas has made known our concern\r\nregarding the transhipment of nuclear and hazardous\r\nwaste through the Caribbean Sea. Yet these shipments\r\ncontinue. We reiterate our wish to see these shipments\r\nstopped: they constitute the gravest risk to the fragility of\r\nour marine environment and our economies.\r\nThe significant number of reviews issued recently or\r\nexpected in the coming months, of the outcomes of\r\nUnited Nations Conferences on small island developing\r\nStates, population and development, social development\r\nand women, attest to the efforts of the United Nations to\r\nmeet its economic and social obligations under the\r\nCharter. The Bahamas confidently expects that these\r\nreviews will all confirm that renewed political will and\r\naction are required to meet the goals we set, at a high\r\nlevel, in Barbados, Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing.\r\nLet me comment briefly on our continuing efforts to\r\nmaintain the momentum for gender equality, a subject\r\nwhich will be taken up in the five-year Beijing review.\r\nWomen worldwide continue to break through glass\r\nceilings. In the Bahamas, for example, women have made\r\nsignificant strides in Parliament, the judiciary, public\r\nservice and business and service organizations. However,\r\nthe Bahamas is cognizant that there are still serious\r\nchallenges to women’s equality. We are particularly\r\nconcerned about the traffic in human beings,\r\npredominantly women and children. The Bahamas intends\r\nto continue its active support, both nationally and\r\ninternationally, for efforts to help women realize their\r\nlegal rights, attain economic empowerment and rise above\r\npoverty. It is our hope, therefore, that the Beijing review\r\nwill result in strategies to further engage the international\r\ncommunity in support of the world’s women.\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nThe Bahamas supports the growing consensus on\r\nhuman rights, which focuses on principles and values\r\nincluding democracy, good governance and the rule of law.\r\nWe also believe that United Nations Member States should\r\nhonour the human rights commitments they have made.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti is a fledgling democracy\r\ncourageously facing significant political, economic and\r\nsocial challenges. These myriad challenges have resulted in\r\na sustained influx of illegal immigration from Haiti into the\r\nBahamas. Together with other illegal immigration,\r\nparticularly from other countries in the Caribbean region,\r\nillegal Haitian immigration continues to be a burden to the\r\nsocio-economic structures of the Bahamas. We therefore\r\nhave a vested interest in the stabilization of Haiti’s\r\ndemocratic institutions and economy. The Bahamas\r\nparticipated in a Caribbean Community mission to Haiti in\r\nJuly of this year; that mission reviewed with the Haitian\r\nGovernment its preparedness for elections. In so doing, we\r\nsignalled our support for the process of free and fair\r\nelections in Haiti. We also fully support the efforts of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and of the General Assembly\r\nfor Haiti’s reconstruction and for the strengthening and\r\nfurtherance of its democracy.\r\nLast year, at the twentieth special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, on the world drug problem, the\r\ninternational community adopted a new and detailed\r\nprogramme of measures to enhance the effectiveness of\r\nnational, regional and international drug control activities.\r\nMember States must now implement the programme,\r\nparticularly by meeting the targets set in the special\r\nsession’s concluding documents. For the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme to carry out its\r\nmandate, adequate resources must be allocated to it.\r\nDrug trafficking into and through the Bahamas is a\r\nmajor threat to our socio-economic development. A\r\nsignificant proportion of the national budget continues to be\r\nspent on drug law enforcement. I wish to emphasize that\r\neven though we do so at the expense of vital national\r\nprogrammes, the Bahamas will not relent in its efforts to\r\novercome the serious challenges posed by drug trafficking\r\nand related criminality. We are particularly concerned about\r\nthe traffic in illicit firearms, which appears to be working\r\nin tandem with the drug trade. Further, with the increase in\r\nfirearms comes an increase in violent crime committed with\r\nthose firearms. We continue to urge greater efforts to\r\ncontrol the illicit manufacture of and trafficking in firearms,\r\nincluding the ratification and implementation of relevant\r\ninternational conventions.\r\nThe failure to achieve general and complete\r\ndisarmament means that serious threats to international\r\npeace and security persist. The production and stockpiling\r\nof chemical, biological and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction exacerbate this situation. The Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, to which the Bahamas is a party, has been a\r\nkey success in recent disarmament initiatives. The\r\nConvention demonstrates what can be achieved when\r\nthere is unity of purpose in the field of disarmament.\r\nIn a constantly changing global environment, United\r\nNations reform must continue to be a priority to ensure\r\nthat the Organization remains relevant to the role\r\nenvisaged for it under the Charter. Negotiations on the\r\nmultifaceted objective of Security Council reform have\r\nmoved at a frustratingly slow pace. It is clear that the\r\nCouncil must be reformed, and that one of the main\r\nobjectives must be its enlargement. This has the support\r\nof the Bahamas. However, in determining criteria for\r\nexpanded membership of the Council, consideration must\r\nbe given to a mechanism for all Members to enjoy the\r\nprivilege of serving thereon.\r\nThe Bahamas welcomes the General Assembly’s\r\ndecision to convene a millennium summit at the\r\nbeginning of the Millennium Assembly. We share the\r\nview that the summit should not be just a\r\ncommemoration, but should also be substantive. The\r\nBahamas wishes to reflect briefly on what the summit’s\r\napproach might include. We see the summit not as a\r\nforum for a restatement of lofty ideals or of the practical\r\ninitiatives that were the outcomes of past international\r\nconferences. The millennium summit must be used as a\r\ncatalyst that would build, especially, on the outcomes of\r\nthose conferences to produce a revitalized international\r\nagenda for the twenty-first century. That agenda should\r\ntake into account the accomplishments of the United\r\nNations system as a whole in the areas of economic and\r\nsocial development as well as peace and security, and it\r\nshould be realistic. From this last perspective, it is the\r\ncontinued position of the Bahamas that the question of\r\nrefugees, for example, should not continue to be divorced\r\nfrom the broader question of illegal migration.\r\nUnder the revitalized agenda, the United Nations\r\nwould have improved partnerships with other regional and\r\ninternational organizations. Such partnerships with\r\norganizations including the Commonwealth, the\r\nOrganization of American States and the Caribbean\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nCommunity would further the coordination of solutions to\r\nproblems of a global nature.\r\nThe United Nations cannot do what we ask of it unless\r\nit is provided with the necessary resources. The common\r\nvalues we share, and our determination to find solutions to\r\nthe world’s problems, should give us the political will to\r\nbuild on what the United Nations has accomplished to date.\r\nThus, the Organization must be assured of funding on a\r\nreliable, predictable and timely basis to carry out the\r\nmandates entrusted to it by its Member States.\r\nThe broad range of problems and issues on the United\r\nNations agenda cannot be solved without investment in\r\nmultilateralism and partnerships. It is our responsibility to\r\nmake the United Nations a highly effective organization\r\nfully capable of responding to the security, political,\r\neconomic and social challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Bahamas pledges its full commitment to play its part\r\nin United Nations efforts to secure a better future for all.\r\nThe President: I call next on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Haiti, His Excellency Mr. Fritz Longchamp.\r\nMr. Longchamp (Haiti) (spoke in French): The\r\nRepublic of Haiti finds it a source of genuine satisfaction\r\nthat the fifty-fourth regular session of the General\r\nAssembly is being presided over by Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab,\r\na man for whom we have a great deal of admiration. With\r\npositive results, he has competently and responsibly served\r\nhis country, Namibia, which is quite rightly considered one\r\nof the symbols of the success of our Organization. We take\r\nthis opportunity to wish him every success in the\r\ntremendous and noble task he has undertaken.\r\nWe pay tribute to Mr. Didier Opertti, Foreign Minister\r\nof Uruguay, who so effectively conducted the proceedings\r\nof the fifty-third session.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to convey our most\r\nsincere greetings to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nwho, at a time when our world is facing many challenges,\r\nhas known how to use his intelligence and the wisdom of\r\nhis great experience to help the community of nations face\r\nup to the inevitable changes of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe also welcome, with great satisfaction, the\r\nadmission of the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tanga as full-fledged Members\r\nof our Organization. They will strengthen the universal\r\nnature of the Organization and enrich its diversity of points\r\nof view.\r\nWe take the floor this 1 October, one day after the\r\nanniversary of the bloody coup d’état of 1991, a genuine\r\nact of assassination of democracy and of the dream of an\r\nentire people. Without the determined action of the United\r\nNations and its Members, contemplating this sad and\r\ndeadly event would have been even more painful for the\r\npeople of Haiti today. We would therefore like to express\r\nonce again our gratitude to the international community\r\nfor having ensured the restoration of democratic\r\nconstitutional order in Haiti.\r\nSince that restoration of democracy, the Government\r\nand the people of Haiti, helped by the international\r\ncommunity, have worked zealously to ensure an\r\nenvironment favourable to the blossoming of democracy\r\nand economic progress. This effort has not yet yielded the\r\nresults we had hoped for, because over the last five years\r\nthe Republic of Haiti has had to confront problems arising\r\nfrom the complexity of its situation. But through the will\r\nof our people and its Government, the Haitian dream of\r\ndemocracy will become a reality.\r\nAbove all, the Government of the Republic is still\r\nconvinced of the critical importance of the renewal of its\r\ninstitutions, in particular of the Parliament, most of whose\r\nmembers had their term of office expire on 11 January\r\n1999. To this end, fair, honest, democratic elections will\r\nbe organized in the next few months. The head of State,\r\nMr. René Préval, has repeatedly and solemnly affirmed\r\nhis determination to create the conditions to make it\r\npossible for the elections to be organized by the\r\nProvisional Electoral Council. Of course, as guarantor of\r\nthe functioning of the institutions, the President of the\r\nRepublic has considered that the most important thing is\r\nthe establishment of the physical conditions necessary for\r\nwell-organized elections, rather than hasty elections the\r\nresults of which might be called into question because of\r\norganizational shortcomings. For President Préval, the\r\nholding of the elections must lead to a solution to our\r\ncrisis and not its perpetuation, or even the creation of yet\r\nanother crisis.\r\nIn order to work to consolidate its achievements, the\r\nGovernment hopes that a consensus will be found to\r\ncontinue technical assistance for professionalizing the\r\nNational Police, in strict compliance with Haitian law.\r\nThe Government of the Republic wants to avoid any\r\ninterruption of the effort to thoroughly reform the judicial\r\nsystem and to promote full respect for all dimensions of\r\nhuman rights.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is\r\nundoubtedly a highly symbolic moment. As the last session\r\nof this century, it ought to come up with a vision that\r\nwould make our Organization an essential and efficient\r\ninstrument for meeting the challenges that await us in the\r\ntwenty-first century. We know the contours of this vision,\r\nas they were sketched after the Stockholm Conference on\r\nthe Human Environment, the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment in Copenhagen and the Rio Earth Summit.\r\nThe sketch is filled in by the ideal of the peoples of the\r\nwhole world, as expressed in our Charter: to save future\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, to ensure respect for\r\nfundamental human rights, to promote social progress and\r\nto establish better conditions of living in greater freedom.\r\nThus, our task at this fifty-fourth session should be to fully\r\nwork out, by means of our discussions and the work of the\r\nvarious committees, the concept and ways of implementing\r\nthis vision.\r\nThe fifty-fourth session will also be an opportunity for\r\nthe United Nations to give deeper thought to its mission of\r\nensuring international peace and security and of promoting\r\neconomic and social development. In this regard, the\r\nRepublic of Haiti is happy to note that the situation in East\r\nTimor is improving following the actions of the\r\ninternational community and its cooperation with the\r\nIndonesian authorities. We hope that the presence of the\r\nmultinational peace force will help bring the country out of\r\nthe chaos into which it has been plunged. We urge the\r\nIndonesian Government and its allies in East Timor to fully\r\nrespect the decision of the ballot box and to take measures\r\nto ensure East Timor’s peaceful transition to independence\r\nand democracy.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti also welcomes the end of the\r\nstate of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The\r\nAgreement signed in Lusaka, under the aegis of President\r\nFrederick Chiluba, between the protagonists in this conflict\r\nis clear evidence that Africa is in the process of providing\r\nitself with the means to become master of its diplomatic\r\nand geographical destiny.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti calls upon India and Pakistan to\r\ndo everything possible to find a permanent solution to the\r\nKashmir conflict and to put an end to their nuclear arms\r\nrace, which is indeed a frightening process that diverts\r\ntremendous financial resources and brainpower to\r\ndestruction when they could be put at the service of\r\nsurvival and development.\r\nOnce again the Haitian Government reiterates its\r\ncondemnation of all forms of terrorist activities that might\r\ncause material and human damage. We reaffirm our faith\r\nin the fundamental rights of man and in the general\r\nprinciples of international law as the basis of norms that\r\ngovern the relations among States.\r\nIn the face of the conflicts that threaten international\r\npeace and security, it is reassuring that the Director-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization, Mr. Federico Mayor, has had the\r\nidea of promoting throughout the world the culture of\r\npeace, which is so vital to good relations within and\r\nbetween nations. The promotion of a genuine culture of\r\npeace is inseparable from the democratization of the\r\ninternational order. One of the fundamental aspects of this\r\ndemocratization lies in the solution to the question of\r\nequitable representation in the Security Council. It is time\r\nfor this Assembly to reach a consensus on this subject of\r\nsuch crucial importance for the future of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nAn equally important point for establishing a\r\ngenuine culture of peace is the implementation of United\r\nNations resolutions in the realm of international security.\r\nMany resolutions have not been implemented when their\r\nimplementation would be decisive, not only in the context\r\nof North-South relations, but also in the context of the\r\nindispensable relationships to be developed between\r\nStates, international institutions and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nOver the last two months, the Government and the\r\npeople of Haiti have observed with sadness and\r\nhelplessness the destruction wreaked and the terrible toll\r\ntaken by the natural disasters that have struck Turkey,\r\nTaiwan, Greece, the Bahamas and the United States. We\r\nwish to reiterate to the people of these countries that we\r\nshare their pain and offer our heartfelt solidarity, having\r\nourselves, unfortunately, experienced such disasters.\r\nWe take this opportunity to repeat that the Haitian\r\nGovernment is following attentively the evolution of\r\nrelations between the two countries on the Taiwan Strait.\r\nOur Government notes with satisfaction that the two sides\r\nare undertaking measures to establish a climate of\r\nconfidence, respect and prosperity, which will be of the\r\nutmost benefit to the peoples who live there.\r\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, the fight for the\r\nelimination of poverty remains one of the most noble\r\ntasks of the United Nations system, in order to establish,\r\nas we are bidden by our Charter, better living conditions\r\nfor the human beings living on this earth.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nPresident Gurirab recently echoed the feelings of the\r\nvast majority of developing countries when he noted that\r\nglobalization might open the floodgates of competition in\r\nsuch a way that certain States would be wiped off the map.\r\nTherefore it is up to the United Nations and to each country\r\nto examine attentively the means of remedying the ill\r\neffects of globalization on the social and economic\r\nstructures of every country — and particularly its effects on\r\nsmall developing countries. Certainly globalization has its\r\npositive side, bringing human communities closer together\r\npolitically, socially and culturally. But it must not be used\r\nas a pretext for a standardization that might neutralize the\r\ndiversity that is the very strength of humanity.\r\nOn the eve of the third millennium what should unite\r\nus more than ever, beyond our differences and often highly\r\ndivergent interests, is the laying down of foundations to\r\nbring about the security of all and the elimination of\r\npoverty as the initial phase of a planetary process of true\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call\r\non the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Togo, Mr. Joseph\r\nKokou Koffigoh.\r\nMr. Koffigoh (Togo) (spoke in French): I am pleased\r\nto join those who spoke before me in expressing my\r\nwarmest congratulations to the President on his election to\r\nlead this fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. This\r\nchoice reflects the great esteem in which the international\r\ncommunity holds his country, Namibia, as well as being a\r\ntribute to his past as a freedom fighter and to his qualities\r\nas a statesman. I assure him of the wholehearted support of\r\nmy delegation as he carries out his duties.\r\nI would also like to extend my most sincere\r\ncongratulations to President Gurirab’s predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Uruguay, for the skill with which he conducted\r\nthe work of the fifty-third session of the Assembly.\r\nTo Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nI would like to express the utmost appreciation of the\r\nGovernment of Togo for the perspicacity and tenacity he\r\nhas shown in seeking solutions to the many problems facing\r\nthe Organization.\r\nFinally, I would like to take advantage of this\r\nopportunity to warmly congratulate the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on their\r\nadmission into this great family, the United Nations.\r\nWe have met once again this year to take stock of\r\nactions carried out in pursuit of our common objectives\r\nand to coordinate our views on what actions to take in\r\norder to address today’s challenges. Given the current\r\nstate of the world, we must acknowledge that, despite the\r\nsignificant progress that has been made, the world is still\r\nmarked, unfortunately, by instability, raging wars and\r\ntensions that are most often due to widespread poverty\r\nand to the uneven distribution of resources, as well as to\r\nthe legitimate aspiration of peoples for greater freedom,\r\njustice and well-being.\r\nIndeed, at a time when mankind is getting ready to\r\nembark on the third millennium, our world offers one of\r\nthe bleakest pictures in its history from an economic and\r\nsocial point of view. All kinds of problems linked to\r\nunderdevelopment, poverty and inequalities between\r\ndeveloped and disadvantaged countries — problems long\r\ndenounced in this and other forums — have worsened in\r\nrecent years as a result of the globalization of the\r\neconomy. Although developed countries have benefited\r\nfrom this phenomenon, especially in the areas of trade\r\nand investment, developing countries are suffering the\r\nnegative impact of globalization on their economies,\r\nwhich have already been rendered fragile by their\r\nunbearable debt burden, the plummeting of prices for raw\r\nmaterials and the steady decline in official development\r\nassistance.\r\nAs regards the external-debt problem in particular,\r\nwe can never stress enough how the accumulation of this\r\ndebt hampers development efforts. The awareness of the\r\nextent of this problem and of its impact on development\r\nis such that the most industrialized countries and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and those of the United\r\nNations system now acknowledge that most of the\r\ndeveloping countries’ debt can never be repaid. They also\r\nacknowledge quite openly that the debt burden is the\r\nmajor obstacle to the development of poor countries and\r\nthat the mechanisms that have been established to resolve\r\nthe debt crisis have not been very effective.\r\nWithin this context we can only welcome the\r\ncommitment of the G-8 summit, held last June in\r\nCologne, to cancel a portion of the debt of world’s\r\npoorest countries. My delegation encourages the\r\ninternational community to continue to take bold steps\r\naimed at resolving the debt problem in an effective and\r\nlasting manner. These steps might include the cancellation\r\nof all of the bilateral debt of the poorest countries, a\r\nsignificant reduction of the debt burden of middle-income\r\nand low-income countries, and increasing the flexibility\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative so\r\nas to make its benefits more generally available. However,\r\nwe should point out that the implementation of such\r\nmeasures should not be carried out to the detriment of\r\nofficial development assistance, which, unfortunately,\r\ncontinues to decline.\r\nAs regards trade, it is generally acknowledged that the\r\nexpansion of international trade is a true engine for growth\r\nand development. We would like to see the international\r\ncommunity take appropriate measures to integrate\r\ndeveloping countries into the international-trade regime,\r\nthrough increasing access for their exports to the markets\r\nof developed countries, by supporting the diversification\r\nand strengthening of developing countries’ production\r\ncapacities, and by improving terms of trade.\r\nWe sincerely hope that the forthcoming negotiations\r\nat the World Trade Organization, the tenth United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development and between the\r\nEuropean Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific\r\ncountries will take into account the interests of the weakest\r\npartners.\r\nIn recent years, many initiatives have been taken on\r\nthe bilateral and multilateral levels to try to address the\r\nchallenges faced by the African continent. In this respect,\r\nI would cite the United States initiative for a Partnership\r\nfor Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa and the\r\nTokyo International Conferences on African Development.\r\nWhile this may be satisfying, there is still reason, in the\r\nname of efficiency, to call for some degree of coordination\r\nbetween these initiatives and those of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nEfforts to promote development and eradicate poverty\r\nin Africa cannot be dissociated from our daily struggle to\r\nsafeguard peace and security. For our countries again this\r\nyear, preserving and consolidating a climate of peace and\r\nstability have been the major imperative, given the many\r\nreal dangers.\r\nThus, the Government of Togo, traditionally inclined\r\nto search for peace and stability, has spared no effort to try\r\nto reconcile points of view whenever discord arises,\r\nconvinced that dialogue and cooperation should be\r\nemphasized in the settlement of disputes and that any\r\nconflict that may arise in any country of a subregion\r\nrepresents a tragedy for the entire subregion, and perhaps\r\nAfrica as a whole.\r\nInspired by the spirit of subregional solidarity that,\r\nunder the President of our Republic, Mr. Gnassingbé\r\nEyadéma, current Chairman of the Authority of Heads of\r\nState and Government of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States (ECOWAS), we have carried out\r\nactions and taken appropriate initiatives to find negotiated\r\nsolutions to the crisis in Guinea-Bissau, the conflict in\r\nSierra Leone and the border dispute between Guinea and\r\nLiberia.\r\nFollowing the crisis that erupted in Guinea-Bissau in\r\nJune 1998, the efforts of the ECOWAS and the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries led to the\r\nsigning of a ceasefire and a peace Agreement in\r\nNovember 1998. The subsequent deployment of an\r\nECOWAS Monitoring Group contingent with woefully\r\ninadequate means did not allow us effectively to\r\nimplement the provisions of the Abuja Agreement and the\r\nLomé Protocol, nor did it entirely allay tensions. Despite\r\nthe brutal upheaval of the peace process on 7 May 1999,\r\nthe Security Council ratified the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to maintain the United Nations office in Guinea-\r\nBissau with a new mandate. We hope that the\r\nOrganization and the international community will\r\ncontinue to provide the necessary assistance to the people\r\nof Guinea-Bissau, who so desperately need it. We\r\nwelcome the commitments undertaken that will ensure\r\nrespect for the elections of November 1997. We expect\r\nthat tranquility and security will return to Guinea-Bissau.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, thanks to the initiative and\r\ndetermination of the ECOWAS heads of State and to the\r\nsupport of the international community, the Government\r\nof Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front\r\nsigned, in our capital city of Lomé on 7 July 1999, a\r\nPeace Agreement whose implementation will, we hope,\r\nallow the people of Sierra Leone to embark decisively on\r\nthe path of national reconciliation, stability and\r\nreconstruction. Thus, as I pointed out yesterday\r\nbefore the Security Council in the context of the open\r\ndebate on the situation in Africa, the restoration is closely\r\nlinked to the implementation of the Lomé Peace\r\nAgreement.\r\nThat is why I am pleased by the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal in his latest report on Sierra Leone to create a\r\nUnited Nations force of 6,000 in that country, in keeping\r\nwith this Agreement. I am convinced that the Security\r\nCouncil, which has already begun to consider the matter,\r\nwill authorize as soon as possible the deployment of that\r\nforce, which, in compliance with its mandate, will help\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nthe Government of Sierra Leone to implement the stalled\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme.\r\nWe also wish particularly to thank the Government of\r\nthe United Kingdom, which chairs the international contact\r\ngroup on Sierra Leone; the international organizations and\r\nhumanitarian agencies; and all those who have variously\r\ncontributed to restoring peace in that country. I recall the\r\nfine spirit of solidarity that was manifest during the\r\nnegotiations on the Lomé Peace Agreement, which allowed\r\nthe representatives of the United States of America, the\r\nUnited Kingdom, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the\r\nSecretary-General of the Organization of African Unity, as\r\nwell as the permanent representatives of the United Nations\r\nand the Secretary-General’s Special Representative in Sierra\r\nLeone to pool their efforts around the seven-member\r\nECOWAS contact group, which worked tirelessly day and\r\nnight for success in Sierra Leone. That is why we feel that\r\nthe decision to embark as soon as possible on the\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme\r\nwith the dispatch of 6,000 United Nations blue helmets\r\nwould put an end to this war.\r\nAs for Liberia, the Ad Hoc Committee of the\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of ECOWAS met on 26\r\nAugust 1999 in Lomé to study the destabilization of that\r\nbrotherly country. My delegation makes an urgent appeal to\r\nthe parties involved to respect the relevant provisions of the\r\nECOWAS Treaty and the non-aggression protocol signed in\r\nLagos on 22 April 1998 in order to allow the immediate\r\nrestoration of a climate of peace, security and confidence in\r\nthe subregion. In this respect, we were pleased by the\r\nrecent signing in Abuja, on 16 September, of the\r\nunderstanding between the heads of State of Guinea and\r\nLiberia during the ECOWAS mini-summit, held in the\r\ncapital of Nigeria. We also appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to provide the necessary support to countries of\r\nthe subregion that have borne the burden of refugees,\r\nGuinea-Bissau in particular, so that they may address that\r\nproblem.\r\nElsewhere, the perpetuation of armed conflicts, with\r\ntheir humanitarian consequences of all kinds, deeply\r\nconcerns my delegation. In this respect, we welcome the\r\nsigning in Lusaka on 12 July of the Ceasefire Agreement\r\nbetween the main parties to the conflict in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and ardently call for a stronger\r\ncommitment of the Security Council to assist the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community countries.\r\nIn Angola, we hope that the joint efforts of the United\r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity will allow\r\nthe people of that country to achieve reconciliation and\r\nwill encourage the restoration of peace and stability in\r\nthat country. In any case, Togo is determined to apply the\r\ndecisions of our United Nations with respect to the steps\r\ntaken against the belligerent parties in Angola.\r\nAs to the border dispute between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, my delegation sincerely hopes that these two\r\nbrotherly countries will truly embark on the path towards\r\na peaceful solution of their dispute.\r\nIt is comforting to note that real progress has been\r\nmade with regard to the crisis stemming from the\r\nLockerbie affair after many years of procrastination which\r\npenalized the fraternal people of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya. The Government of Togo believes that in\r\nplacing the two Lockerbie bombing suspects at the\r\ndisposal of the United Nations, Libya has met its\r\nobligations under Security Council resolutions and that\r\nthe Security Council must immediately lift the sanctions\r\nimposed on that country. This will contribute to ending\r\nthe suffering of our Libyan brothers, which has lasted too\r\nlong.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East, we reaffirm our\r\nstrong conviction that an era of lasting peace, stability and\r\nsecurity for all can come about only through the\r\ncontinuation of the peace process and the most resolute\r\npolitical will on all sides, based on Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and\r\nthe principle of “land for peace”. In this context, the\r\nGovernment of Togo welcomes developments in that\r\nregion, through steps recently taken by President Yasser\r\nArafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak. We urge the\r\nparties concerned to continue to work tirelessly to find\r\nways and means to allow the harmonious continuation of\r\nthe peace process.\r\nOne of the most important events that will have\r\nmost deeply marked this fading century is undeniably the\r\nend of the cold war. Among other things, it resulted in\r\naverting the spectre of a nuclear holocaust; at least, we\r\nhope so.\r\nDeeply attached to the principle of general and\r\ncomplete disarmament under effective international\r\ncontrol, Togo is still concerned about nuclear\r\ndisarmament and the elimination of other weapons of\r\nmass destruction. This is why we appeal for continued\r\nefforts to put an end to the proliferation of nuclear arms\r\nand the threats they entail.\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nThe same applies to proliferation of and illicit\r\ntrafficking in light weapons and small arms in Africa. My\r\ncountry welcomes United Nations initiatives to curtail and\r\ncontain this phenomenon, and hopes that the international\r\nconference decided upon by the General Assembly in\r\nresolution 53/77 E of 4 December 1998, and scheduled to\r\ntake place in Geneva in 2001, will make it possible to find\r\neffective solutions to this problem.\r\nI would also like to stress the role played in this\r\ncontext by the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace\r\nand Disarmament in Africa, which organized in Lomé, from\r\n2 to 4 August 1999, a workshop on illicit trafficking in\r\nlight weapons. I am pleased to take this opportunity to pay\r\na well deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization, who has just provided this Centre with a\r\nDirector, whose main task it is to revitalize its activities and\r\nmobilize the necessary funds to finance its operational\r\nexpenses. Because of its important role in implementing the\r\nProgramme for Coordination and Assistance for Security\r\nand Development, as well as in the destruction of arms\r\ncollected during the peace process in Liberia, we feel that\r\nsupport for its work is urgently needed. In this connection,\r\nwe thank the Italian, Japanese, Norwegian and Swedish\r\nGovernments for their generous voluntary contributions and\r\nreiterate our appeal to the international community to\r\nprovide financial and logistical support.\r\nI turn to the functioning of our Organization. Here I\r\nstress the fundamental role of the Security Council in\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. My delegation\r\nreaffirms its support for all reforms to strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of the Council and provide representation for\r\nAfrica, in the form of a permanent Member, in keeping\r\nwith the will of the heads of State and Government of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity.\r\nThroughout its long history, my country has never\r\nstrayed from the purposes of our Organization. We have\r\noften expressed and shown our dedication to the ideals of\r\npeace and justice, as well as the principles of democracy\r\nand the protection of human rights. Going beyond the social\r\nand political crises that we have known in recent years, the\r\npeople of Togo are resolutely engaged in a new process of\r\nnational understanding and harmony, something I wish to\r\nemphasize. On 19 July 1999, on the initiative of General\r\nEyadema, President of the Republic, an internal dialogue\r\nbringing together all of the political actors of the country\r\nwas organized following preliminary meetings held at Paris\r\nand Lomé between March and June 1999.\r\nThe opportunity was given to representatives of the\r\npresidential leadership and of the Togolese opposition to\r\nfreely express themselves on the major issues of political\r\nlife in our country, under the arbitration of international\r\nfacilitators. In this regard, I would like to renew our\r\ndeepest gratitude to France, the Federal Republic of\r\nGermany, the European Union and the International\r\nOrganization of La Francophonie for the important role\r\nthey played during these negotiations, which led to the\r\nsigning of a framework agreement on 29 July 1999. For\r\nthe implementation of the agreement, the Government has\r\nshown itself ready to make all necessary concessions that\r\nare in the national interest, it being understood that\r\nnational reconciliation is vital to the continuation of the\r\nprocess of democratization and the consolidation of the\r\nrule of law in Togo, as elsewhere.\r\nWe are sure that reason and the national interest will\r\nprevail, so that the hopes of the people of Togo and the\r\ninternational community are not disappointed.\r\nThe Government regards the signing of the\r\nagreement as an important step in our resolute march\r\ntowards building a democratic society and bringing about\r\ndevelopment. We therefore solemnly appeal to the\r\ninternational community to resume effective cooperation\r\nwith Togo, in order to allow its population to enjoy the\r\nfruits of democratization. Poverty is the enemy of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nThe complexity of the issues and the many\r\nchallenges to be taken up at the dawn of the third\r\nmillennium call for a strengthening of international\r\ncooperation and, above all, greater solidarity with Africa.\r\nNo nation, no country, whatever its resources and\r\nabilities, can tackle these challenges alone. Cooperation\r\nbetween the peoples of the United Nations is vital to us.\r\nWe must therefore act together, consolidating our\r\nsolidarity within the framework of our Organization,\r\nwhich, after half a century of existence, has proved that\r\nit is an irreplaceable tool at the service of mankind.\r\nTogo, which once again proclaims its faith in the\r\nUnited Nations, would encourage it to relentlessly pursue\r\nin the century to come the achievement of its Charter\r\npurposes.\r\nMay this session strengthen us in our common\r\nstruggle to consolidate peace, justice, freedom and\r\nprogress in the world and foster more understanding\r\nbetween nations. Togo is ready to contribute to this effort.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in English): I call on the\r\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs of Grenada, His\r\nExcellency The Hon. Mark Isaac.\r\nMr. Isaac (Grenada): My delegation is delighted to\r\ncongratulate the President on his election. My delegation\u0027s\r\nhearty congratulations are made even warmer as he has the\r\nprivilege and the honour to take the fifty-fourth session, as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, from the twentieth into\r\nthe twenty-first century. A similar unique place in history\r\nwill not be observed for another hundred years. We are\r\nconfident, in view of his past heroic leadership of the South\r\nWest Africa People\u0027s Organization (SWAPO), and now as\r\nthe Foreign Minister of Namibia, he will conduct our\r\ndeliberations with vision and dynamism.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to express our grateful\r\nappreciation to Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay for his skilful\r\nand productive conduct of the proceedings of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-third session.\r\nMy delegation welcomes to the family of nations the\r\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\r\nKingdom of Tonga and offers hearty congratulations.\r\nAs the curtain makes its slow descent upon the\r\ntwentieth century, bringing it to its inevitable close, there is\r\na prevailing mood of reflection and anticipation. Rightly so,\r\nas a connection between past, present and future is being\r\nmade, for we cannot appreciate the present without\r\nknowledge of the past if we hope to ensure the future. And\r\nindeed, historically speaking, the past is never past, for\r\nwhat is past is prologue.\r\nIn retrospect, for some developing countries the period\r\nof the 1980s was considered a lost decade because of the\r\nheavy burden of debt servicing, falling commodity prices,\r\nnegative economic growth, unemployment and structural\r\nadjustment. In the 1990s, the catchwords seemed to be\r\n“sustainable development”, “environmentally friendly”,\r\n“good governance”, “globalization”, and “poverty\r\nalleviation”. These phrases seem to be the legacy of the\r\ncluster of United Nations summits of the 1990s: the\r\nConference on Environment and Development in 1992, on\r\nHuman Rights in 1993, on Small Island Developing States\r\nin 1994, on Population and Development in 1994, on Social\r\nDevelopment in 1995, on Women in 1995, on Human\r\nSettlements in 1996 and on Food Security in 1996. In all\r\nthese high-level meetings, the centrality of the human\r\nperson in sustainable social, economic, and cultural\r\ndevelopment was emphasized.\r\nGrenada believes that the concept of sustainable\r\ndevelopment is shared responsibility on the part of\r\ndeveloped and developing countries. Its global character\r\nmust be recognized so that there can be more sharing of\r\nknowledge, ideas, information and resources.\r\nConsequently, the region from which I come, the\r\nCaribbean, strongly urges our more developed partners\r\nurgently to make available new and additional sources of\r\nfunding and technological transfer to enable us to comply\r\nwith the obligations the international Conventions demand\r\nof us. In short, the concepts of the global village and\r\nglobalization should be premised on giving, caring and\r\nsharing.\r\nSustainable development is not possible without\r\nrespect for the whole range of human rights — economic,\r\nsocial, cultural, civil and political. Indeed, human rights\r\nare meaningless in an environment of poverty and\r\ndeprivation. The United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, has said, aptly, that\r\nperhaps the largest scale of human rights violations today\r\nis the fact that one fifth of humanity lives in absolute\r\npoverty. World Bank estimates reveal that over 35 per\r\ncent of people in the Caribbean basin live below the\r\npoverty line. This situation threatens the very existence of\r\ncivil societies there.\r\nMoreover, the plight of certain small Caribbean\r\nStates is further compounded by the World Trade\r\nOrganization\u0027s inhumane rulings over the European Union\r\nbanana regime. We are still baffled over the attitude of\r\nour traditional ally and certain friendly Latin American\r\ncountries over the modified version of the banana regime.\r\nWe are hopeful, though, that a satisfactory compromise\r\nwill be arrived at soon. If so, the economies of the small,\r\nbanana-producing countries would be saved from the\r\nshocks of a banana industry become non-existent.\r\nI stress that there is an urgent need to unite our\r\nefforts in a common framework to alleviate the problems\r\nassociated with critical poverty in order to restore some\r\nform of human dignity in our countries.\r\nTo the observer with no inside knowledge of the\r\nworking of the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies, the series of meetings to review what has\r\nalready been reviewed, and perhaps in some cases already\r\nimplemented, seem as complex as quantum physics and\r\nexercises in repetitive and confusing rhetoric.\r\nNevertheless, since the conceptual and structural\r\nframework of sustainable development is shared\r\nresponsibility, my delegation is hopeful that the recently-\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nended special session to review the implementation of the\r\n1994 Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States has given\r\nsome impetus to the creation of this global partnership we\r\nall desire. We are equally hopeful that the project proposals\r\nsubmitted by Grenada will be favourably considered and\r\nappropriate funding made available to execute them.\r\nThe Caribbean Sea is a unique body of water\r\nbordering a large number of States, with overlapping\r\nexclusive economic zones, vulnerable to the elements of\r\nnature and also to man-made disasters. The Caribbean Sea\r\nis indisputably the lifeblood of the countries of the\r\nCaribbean Community — one half of whose population\r\nlives on the coastline, where 20 per cent of the regional\r\ngross domestic product is produced — and provides\r\nemployment for more than 25 per cent of the labour force\r\nin tourism and the fishing industry. Sustainable\r\nmanagement and development of the Caribbean Sea and its\r\nresources would benefit not only the Caribbean people but\r\nalso the international community as a whole.\r\nMoreover, recognition of the Caribbean Sea as a\r\nspecial area within the context of sustainable development\r\nwould provide the jurisdictional authority necessary to\r\ncontrol the passage of ships carrying toxic and hazardous\r\nwastes and chemical and radioactive materials in Caribbean\r\nwaters. My delegation urges this special recognition of the\r\nCaribbean Sea for all of the reasons I have stated.\r\nWe are mindful that we do not own the Earth; we are\r\nsimply holding it in trust for succeeding generations. We\r\nare admonished not to treat the land with contempt and\r\nremember that from it we came and to it we shall return.\r\nGrenada is absolutely clear about its commitment to\r\nthe principles of the United Nations and therefore reveres\r\nthe ideals which informed those principles. Grenada thus\r\nplaces a premium on fairness and justice in the conduct of\r\ninternational affairs. It is in this context that the\r\nGovernment of Grenada wishes to request that a fresh look\r\nbe taken at United Nations General Assembly resolution\r\n2758 (XXVI) of 1971, as a matter of simple justice and\r\nfairness to the people of the Republic of China. This\r\nhumanitarian-minded and democratically inclined country\r\nhas used its hard-earned resources to help developing\r\ncountries to help themselves, by providing training,\r\nexpertise and capital for developmental projects and other\r\nforms of technical assistance in several critical areas. The\r\nnoble efforts of the Republic of China reminds one of the\r\ngreat Chinese philosopher, Confucius, and his thoughts on\r\ngiving a man a fish and teaching a man to fish, Grenada\r\napplauds the sacrifices of the Republic of China in this\r\nregard.\r\nIndeed, the Republic of China has wrought an\r\neconomic miracle, to the point where it is the fourteenth\r\nmost important trading country and its foreign reserves\r\nrank among the top in the world.\r\nThe international community cannot simply ignore\r\nthe aspirations of such a dynamic and generous people,\r\nand should thus ensure that the fundamental right of the\r\n22 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to\r\nparticipate in the activities of the United Nations be fully\r\nrespected.\r\nEqually, in the name of humanity and justice,\r\nGrenada calls for the lifting of the economic embargo\r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba. World opinion is definitely\r\nswayed towards this, and consequently overwhelming\r\nsupport is given year after year to the relevant resolutions\r\nat the United Nations on this issue. Sadly, though,\r\nenforcement is still outstanding. As we are about to close\r\nanother chapter in the history of mankind, we appeal to\r\nthe Government of the United States of America to once\r\nmore take the lead in showing its humane qualities and\r\nease the pain and suffering of ordinary Cubans. It should\r\ntherefore suspend all sanctions unconditionally.\r\nAs we look to the new century we must urge that\r\nthere be a Middle East of peaceful coexistence,\r\nparticularly between Israel and the Palestinians.\r\nWe certainly hope that past events in the Balkans —\r\nparticularly in Yugoslavia — will not be repeated; and\r\nthat the principle of self-determination will be respected\r\nglobally, the situation in East Timor being a case in point;\r\nthat the various pockets of conflict around the world will\r\nbe resolved amicably; and that any changes contemplated\r\nwithin the United Nations system will take into account\r\nthe concerns and aspirations of smaller nations.\r\nGrenada believes that, with the collective efforts of\r\nall States and the purposeful involvement of the United\r\nNations, democracy, social justice, good governance,\r\nsolidarity and the economic prosperity of all our Members\r\ncould be achieved.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 20th plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nFinally, my country extends its concern and sympathy\r\nto the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and, more\r\nrecently, to our friends in the Republic of China on Taiwan,\r\na country so helpful to us in the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe are also mindful of the situation in East Timor and\r\nhope that as soon as order and security are restored,\r\nindependence, for which the majority voted, will take root.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n26\r\n"
