(Namibia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Gambari\r\n(Nigeria), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Estonia, His Excellency Mr. Toomas\r\nHendrik Ilves.\r\nMr. Ilves (Estonia): Let me begin by congratulating\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election as President of this\r\nfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I wish him all\r\nthe best in carrying out his duties.\r\nAs the General Assembly convenes for the last time\r\nbefore the Millennium Assembly, I believe that it is\r\nappropriate to consider the United Nations future and how\r\nwe can prepare our Organization for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nFifty-four years after its founding, the United Nations\r\nremains the largest multi-purpose intergovernmental\r\nOrganization in the world. Indeed, with 188 Members, the\r\nUnited Nations has become truly global. I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to welcome Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga\r\nto the United Nations family.\r\nThe United Nations faces a vastly different set of\r\ninternational issues from those of fifty-four years ago,\r\nwhen the Organization was founded. Most threats to\r\ninternational security and stability are no longer\r\nState-driven but rather derive from the malfunction or\r\ndysfunction of States. The consequences of these threats,\r\nhowever, are just as severe as the erstwhile threats by\r\nStates. Terrorism, corruption, economic collapse, nuclear\r\nmeltdowns, mass migration and ethnic strife are but a few\r\nof the challenges that the world has had to face in recent\r\nyears. The violent conflict in East Timor, “ethnic\r\ncleansing” in Kosovo, and the recent re-escalation of\r\nviolence in Chechnya are but a few vivid examples of the\r\nnew kinds of threats that we face today.\r\nThe United Nations has a crucial role to play in\r\ncombating these and other international threats. But before\r\nit can start to play a more active role in the post-cold-war\r\ninternational order, serious structural reforms are needed.\r\nEstonia believes that reforms should focus above all\r\non the Security Council. Formally, the Council, originally\r\nintended to be the cornerstone of collective security, is\r\nvested with strong executive authority. Yet in practice its\r\nauthority is challenged. Because of a recurring failure or\r\ninability to take action, countries in crisis situations look\r\nless and less to the Council. In order for the United\r\nNations to avoid relegation to the status of a body that\r\ncreates norms but cannot ensure their implementation,\r\nvoting procedures and mechanisms in the United Nations\r\nmost powerful body should be reformed.\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nThe key issue is voting practice, not the shopworn\r\nissue of non-permanent membership. The often\r\nirresponsible exercise of the veto, or even more often the\r\nthreat of the veto, has paralysed the Security Council and\r\nundermined its legitimacy. More and more often we witness\r\nsome permanent members taking actions to meet their\r\ndomestic interests and foreign policy goals in areas\r\nirrelevant to the issue at hand. We as Member States have\r\ngiven the mandate to the Council. Even before we are able\r\nto carry out the reforms, we must entrust the permanent\r\nmembers to use the veto with utmost responsibility.\r\nAs we look around this Hall, or at the globe, we can\r\nall observe that the world today is not what it was half a\r\ncentury ago — thank God. The United Nations was created\r\nto maintain peace in the wake of the turmoil of the Second\r\nWorld War. Today we are already into the second decade\r\nof the post-cold-war order, two generations removed from\r\nthe problems faced by our grandfathers. Why, then, should\r\nwe be constrained by obsolescent structures still based on\r\nthe power relationships of 1945? The guarantors of and\r\ngreatest contributors to stability in the world have changed\r\nfundamentally in the course of half a century. We need not\r\nfear opening a discussion on whether the moral and legal\r\nreasoning underlying Security Council membership in the\r\nwake of the Second World War is still appropriate for the\r\npost-cold-war era.\r\nFollowing from this, another area where Estonia\r\nbelieves reforms are vitally needed is that of the informal\r\nregional groups that provide the basis for election\r\nprocedures. Many of these groups are based on a now\r\nirrelevant cold war ideological and geopolitical alignment.\r\nA decade after the end of the cold war the East-West divide\r\nhas disappeared, and regional groups, such as the Eastern\r\nEuropean Group, which were a product of that divide,\r\nsimply no longer make sense. In order to make United\r\nNations structures correspond to today’s realities, those\r\nregional groups should become truly geographic.\r\nAllow me now to turn to economic and social\r\ndevelopment. We can all agree that over the years the\r\nUnited Nations has been most successful in that area. The\r\nUnited Nations system has devoted more attention and\r\nresources to development than to any other international\r\nassistance effort. Although these non-political activities\r\nhave received less attention than efforts in the field of\r\npeacekeeping and diplomacy, they are no less important.\r\nMany countries, including mine, have benefited from\r\nUnited Nations assistance. We believe, however, that it is\r\ntime to start to pay back.\r\nProviding development and humanitarian assistance\r\nis a logical and moral consequence of our membership of\r\nthe international community. It should be the goal of\r\nevery country. In this regard, I would like to observe that\r\nmost United Nations activities, whether in the field of\r\npeacekeeping or economic assistance, almost invariably\r\nbecome permanent. Permanence, however, is not a sign of\r\nsuccess; it is a sign of failure. The United Nations should\r\ntherefore concentrate more on preventive actions and on\r\nimplementing well-planned, well-targeted and timely\r\nprogrammes with a clear exit strategy. That, in turn, will\r\nencourage success and positive development, not\r\ndependency.\r\nEstonia values the United Nations function as a\r\nnormative Organization that sets international standards\r\nand universal principles for its Members. The gross\r\nviolations of human rights witnessed this year, including\r\nkillings and mass deportations reminiscent of those\r\nexperienced by my country 50 years ago, show that it is\r\nmore important than ever that countries adhere to\r\ncommon international norms and standards in the field of\r\nhuman rights. As the only truly global Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations should play a greater role in making sure\r\nthat universal principles, enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter, are fairly and fully applied. To pursue this goal\r\nI call upon all countries to support wholeheartedly the\r\nactivities of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights.\r\nEvery year hundreds and thousands of innocent\r\npeople perish as a result of brutal terrorist actions. The\r\nGeneral Assembly has passed a number of resolutions on\r\nthe fight against terrorism, and currently no fewer than 11\r\nanti-terrorism conventions have been adopted. In the light\r\nof the recent terrorist attacks in Russia, we believe that\r\nthe fight against terrorism should be pursued with even\r\ngreater zeal. Terrorism of all kinds should be globally\r\ncondemned and eradicated. At the same time, however,\r\nthe fight against terrorism should not serve as a pretext\r\nfor equally gross violations of human rights, forcible\r\ndetention and the deportation of tens of thousands of\r\ninnocent people all over a country without due process,\r\nsimply because of the colour of their skin or their ethnic\r\nbackground.\r\nAllow me to conclude by saying a few words on the\r\nissue of financing. If the United Nations is to enter the\r\ntwenty-first century as a serious and effective\r\nOrganization, we must commit ourselves to economic\r\nrealities. This means administrative reform, zero budget\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ngrowth and fiscal responsibility, combined with a firm\r\ncommitment by all countries to pay their share.\r\nThe gist of Estonia’s message is that the world has\r\nchanged dramatically in the past half century. Let us adapt\r\nthe Organization to reflect the realities of today. Let us\r\nmake the United Nations an Organization that will continue\r\nto play a vital and prominent role far into the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, His Excellency\r\nMr. Somsavat Lengsavad.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic Republic)\r\n(spoke in Lao; French text furnished by the delegation):\r\nThe unanimous election of Mr. Gurirab to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at this fifty-fourth session is a warm\r\ntribute to Namibia and its heroic people, who are well-\r\nknown for their victorious struggle against foreign\r\ndomination and for their tireless defence of the principles\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. As I am familiar with\r\nhis skill and broad experience of international relations, I\r\nbelieve that under his wise leadership the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session will be crowned with\r\nsuccess.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy sincere congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan, the\r\nSecretary-General of our Organization, for his work to\r\nreform and revitalize the United Nations, as well as for his\r\nsteadfast commitment in the service of peace and\r\ndevelopment throughout the world.\r\nAs this century of rapid change fades away, we are\r\nconfronted with challenges, but also presented with many\r\nopportunities. Globalization has become a problem\r\nthroughout the world. While technological progress and the\r\nglobalization of production and finance have brought\r\nprosperity and modernity to many countries, particularly in\r\nthe developed world, the great majority of people are still\r\nliving in conditions of persistent poverty. The protection of\r\nthe environment, the eradication of poverty and the struggle\r\nagainst drugs and all forms of terrorism have also become\r\nurgent problems requiring concerted action at global level.\r\nIn the face of this situation it is more urgent than ever\r\nfor the international community to adopt concrete collective\r\nmeasures to enable the United Nations to devote more of its\r\nresources to social and economic development in order to\r\nbuild a better life for all the world’s peoples, in particular\r\nfor the poorest among them. If it is to take up these\r\nchallenges, the United Nations, as the only universal\r\ninternational organization, needs the capacity to act and to\r\nadapt to a new and changing world situation.\r\nWith the end of the bipolar world, many countries,\r\nespecially developing countries, had hoped that the\r\nnuclear era would end as well. Here, the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, along with the other countries\r\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), signed the Treaty on the Southeast Asia\r\nNuclear Weapon-Free Zone, which entered into force in\r\n1997. It also endorsed the joint declaration of 9 June\r\n1998, subscribed to by the Foreign Ministers of Brazil,\r\nEgypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South\r\nAfrica and Sweden, the objective of which was to\r\nrevitalize nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament\r\nefforts. Such positive steps will help us together gradually\r\nto build a world free of nuclear weapons, thus creating\r\nmeaningful guarantees for the survival of mankind.\r\nTo guarantee peace, to promote the development of\r\nall countries, and to adapt to a new world situation, the\r\nOrganization must be reformed so that it can fulfil its\r\nmandate and achieve its purposes. Here in the United\r\nNations, all countries have equal standing, in conformity\r\nwith the principle of the sovereign equality of States. And\r\nhere in the United Nations, we extol the principles of the\r\nnon-use or threat of use of force against the independence\r\nor sovereignty of States, of the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, and of non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nother States.\r\nIn speaking of United Nations reform we cannot\r\npass in silence by the delicate work under way in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council, where a number of interesting initiatives\r\nhave been put forward. Our position on this matter is well\r\nknown, and was set out at the fifty-first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly: we favour an increase in both the\r\npermanent and the non-permanent membership, in line\r\nwith the principle of equitable geographical distribution\r\nand taking into account the prominence of the country in\r\nquestion. As part of the effort to attain that goal, some\r\ncountries — such as, in particular, Japan, Germany and\r\nIndia — could become permanent members of a\r\nrestructured Security Council. As we all know, the\r\nquestion of Council reform is not a simple one. We need\r\nto be patient, to continue the debate and to take advantage\r\nof the momentum we have created, so as to attain the\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ngoal of giving that organ greater transparency, legitimacy\r\nand, above all, credibility.\r\nTrue to its consistent policy of peace, friendship and\r\ncooperation, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nconsiders that the use of force against a sovereign\r\nindependent State without Security Council authorization,\r\nno matter what the pretext, runs counter to international law\r\nand the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that all\r\nconflicts, no matter how complex, should be resolved only\r\nthrough negotiations.\r\nConvinced of the importance of peace in the Middle\r\nEast, my country is pleased that Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization have resumed serious negotiations,\r\nwhich led to the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh\r\nMemorandum on 4 September 1999. It is essential for the\r\nparties directly concerned to continue those negotiations in\r\norder to settle their problems on the basis of existing\r\nresolutions and agreements. This would open the path to\r\npeace, cooperation and peaceful coexistence among the\r\npeoples of the region.\r\nAmong the glaring injustices in the world, we cannot\r\nforget the economic, trade and financial blockade that has\r\nbeen waged for more than 40 years against the Republic of\r\nCuba. We consider that the United States ought to put an\r\nend to that operation, which runs counter to the present\r\nworld trend towards international economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nPeace on the Korean peninsula remains fragile. We\r\nappeal to all the countries concerned to show maximal\r\nrestraint and to continue their dialogue with a view to\r\nrestoring mutual understanding, and together to seek\r\nsolutions that would meet the aspirations of the Korean\r\npeople for the peaceful reunification of the two parts of\r\nKorea, and that would contribute to the consolidation of\r\npeace, stability and cooperation in the region.\r\nSince 9 July 1999 we have seen renewed tension in\r\nthe Taiwan Strait. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nreaffirms its consistent position that Taiwan is an integral\r\nand inalienable part of China, and that the Government of\r\nthe People’s Republic of China is the sole legal and\r\nlegitimate representative of the entire Chinese people.\r\nOver the past two years, the financial crisis affecting\r\nthe whole of South-East Asia has quickly made itself felt,\r\nto varying degrees, in other regions — indeed, throughout\r\nthe world. In some countries there are today signs of an\r\neconomic upturn, but nothing indicates that the world\r\neconomy is yet on the road to solid recovery. In the light\r\nof that crisis and of the fact that countries large and\r\nsmall, industrialized and developing, are becoming\r\nincreasingly interdependent, the international community\r\nmust work together to find an effective solution to the\r\ncrisis, to promote worldwide growth, and to bring about\r\nsustained social and economic development.\r\nSince the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit for\r\nSocial Development, the struggle against impoverishment\r\nhas been bolstered. But it is clear that developing\r\ncountries, especially the least developed among them,\r\ncannot accomplish this huge task on their own and\r\nwithout the necessary support and assistance of the\r\ninternational community. In that context, we consider that\r\nthe special follow-up meeting that will take place in 2000\r\nwill give the international community an opportunity to\r\nreview the situation and to take the measures necessary to\r\nattain the noble goals set at the Summit.\r\nFor years, the special problems of landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries have been discussed at various\r\ninternational conferences and meetings. Although many\r\nmeasures have been taken both at the national and at the\r\ninternational levels, those problems are still far from\r\nbeing resolved.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, which has\r\nthe honour of chairing the Group of Landlocked\r\nDeveloping Countries, is cooperating actively with the\r\nother member countries to establish and maintain an\r\neffective and self-sustaining system of transport and\r\ntransit. This huge task requires support and assistance\r\nfrom the entire international community in order for our\r\ncountries to meet our particular needs. It is more than\r\nurgent that the recommendations adopted last August in\r\nNew York at the fourth meeting of governmental experts\r\nfrom landlocked and transit developing countries and\r\nrepresentatives of donor countries, and financial and\r\ndevelopment institutions, be wholly translated into reality\r\nas soon as possible.\r\nIn the Lao People’s Democratic Republic over the\r\npast year, the multi-ethnic Lao people has strongly unified\r\nitself and is actively working for national development,\r\nparticularly in the area of agricultural production. This\r\nhas made it possible for us not only to achieve self-\r\nsufficiency in rice production, but also to have something\r\nof a surplus in reserve. This achievement has helped\r\nsoften the effects of the economic and financial crisis in\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nthe region. Throughout the country, political stability and\r\nsocial harmony, important conditions allowing us to\r\npromote sustained national socio-economic development in\r\nkeeping with the policy of renewal, continue to be ensured.\r\nAt the international level, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic is continuing its efforts to strengthen and extend\r\nits external relations and cooperation, particularly with\r\nneighbouring countries, and it is cooperating with other\r\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in\r\nthe implementation of the Hanoi Plan of Action and of the\r\nVision 2020 for the progress and the prosperity of the\r\nregion.\r\nThe question of drugs continues to be a major concern\r\nin the daily life of South-East Asia. In this respect, my\r\nGovernment has made great efforts to reduce the annual\r\nproduction of opium and is carrying out a vigorous battle\r\nagainst drugs, the results of which have been greatly\r\nappreciated by the international community. At this time, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP), we are working out a\r\nstrategy for a substantial eradication of opium production\r\nover the next six years. In this connection, I appeal to the\r\ninternational community to contribute to the Fund UNDCP\r\nin order to achieve those objectives.\r\nSaving future generations from the scourges of war,\r\npoverty, hunger and sickness remains an essential objective\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. Aware of this\r\nhighest goal, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will\r\nspare no effort to make its modest yet positive contribution.\r\nThe President: I next give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Madagascar, Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Lila Hanitra Ratsifandriamanana.\r\nMrs. Ratsifandriamanana (Madagascar) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Sharing: this will be the theme of my statement\r\nfrom this rostrum, because at the end of this millennium,\r\nwhen globalization rhymes with poverty, insecurity, social\r\nills and natural disasters, the culture of sharing should,\r\nmore than ever, guide our actions.\r\nI want to share, first of all, Mr. President, our\r\nsatisfaction at seeing you conduct the proceedings of this\r\nfifty-fourth session. Along with everyone else, and on\r\nbehalf of the delegation of Madagascar, I would like to\r\nshare my profound conviction that your reputation on the\r\ninternational scene is an asset that will guide our\r\ndiscussions towards encouraging results. A talented\r\ndiplomat and a worthy representative of a people that has\r\nbecome a symbol of heroism and patriotism, you enjoy\r\nour confidence, our support and our admiration.\r\nWe would also like to pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Minister Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for\r\nhaving held and passed on the torch that he carried with\r\nall the competence and determination one would expect\r\nof him.\r\nFurthermore, to the Secretary-General we offer\r\nthanks and recognition for his devotion and wise\r\ndynamism. He has known how to be the spokesman for\r\naspirations of harmony, justice and progress. Under his\r\nenlightened guidance and leadership, our Organization is\r\ntoday well prepared to order the twenty-first century.\r\nI wish to join my voice to those of previous speakers\r\nin greeting and welcoming the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga, which\r\nhave just enlarged our United Nations community. Let\r\nthem share with us the noble ideals that brought us\r\ntogether and keep us together: the equality of peoples\r\nunder the law, respect for the sovereignty of every State,\r\ndemocracy and peace.\r\nSharing with everyone, our pride in belonging to the\r\ngreat family of the United Nations, our forum for\r\nmeeting, discussion, decision-making and solidarity;\r\nsharing the values that provide the foundations for our\r\ninternational community; and sharing in the vital\r\nprogrammes of cooperation carried out synergistically\r\namong all the different actors and constituents of our\r\nstructure and system — these, specifically, are the sources\r\nof our satisfaction.\r\nToday, less than 100 days from the new century and\r\nthe new millennium, we are keenly aware of the\r\ntimeliness of our discussions. Our fifty-fourth session is\r\nof particular significance in that it offers all of us the\r\nopportunity not only to undertake a retrospective\r\nexamination of the major events of the century, but also\r\nto seek ways and means to inject renewed dynamism into\r\nfuture international relations.\r\nThe commitments we made at the fifty-third session\r\nof the General Assembly must be implemented as rapidly\r\nas possible. We can achieve this through concerted efforts\r\nand our shared determination to succeed. However, to do\r\nthis, we must proceed urgently to apply the necessary\r\nmeasures for the restructuring of our Organization.\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nWe reiterate our support for the position of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity regarding the need to expand\r\nthe Security Council. The restructuring of that organ must\r\nbe based on the principles of democracy, transparency and\r\nequitable geographic distribution. On the question of the\r\nveto, in our view there is no room for equivocation: either\r\nit must be extended to all permanent members or it must be\r\nabolished.\r\nOur presence and our interactive participation in the\r\nconcert of nations prompts us to share our thinking on\r\ncertain subjects that constitute challenges of the highest\r\npriority at the end of the century, particularly the questions\r\nof armed conflict, the maintenance of peace, disarmament,\r\ninternational terrorism, democracy and human rights, and\r\nhuman and socio-economic development.\r\nWhile accelerating the integration of our global\r\nsociety, the end of the era of ideological confrontation has\r\nbeen conducive to the proliferation of conflicts of a\r\npolitical, socio-economic, ethnic, cultural or religious\r\nnature.\r\nIs there any need to stress that in all these conflict\r\nsituations the most vulnerable sectors of society —\r\nespecially children, women and the elderly — are the first\r\nvictims. Madagascar therefore shares the general\r\nsatisfaction with the adoption by the Security Council of\r\nresolutions 1261 (1999) and 1265 (1999), on the protection\r\nof civilians in armed conflict.\r\nThere are some signs of satisfaction and hope: the\r\nsigning last 4 September of the Sharm el-Sheikh\r\nMemorandum; the signing in Lomé on 7 July 1999 of a\r\nPeace Agreement for the conflict in Sierra Leone; and the\r\n10 July 1999 signing of the Ceasefire Agreement between\r\nthe principal parties to the conflict in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. Nonetheless, we note that,\r\nunfortunately, many hotbeds of tension remain or are being\r\ncreated throughout the world. The tragic situations in\r\nAngola, Somalia, Afghanistan and Kosovo are clear\r\nexamples of this.\r\nAs regards East Timor, Madagascar pays tribute to the\r\ncourageous efforts of the United Nations Mission in East\r\nTimor during the electoral process. We particularly\r\nwelcome the recent adoption of Security Council resolution\r\n1264 (1999), on decisive measures to put an end to the\r\ncrisis and to ensure strict respect for human rights.\r\nAs regards Western Sahara, Madagascar endorses the\r\ninitiative of the United Nations to organize a free, honest\r\nand impartial referendum, as well as the extension of the\r\nmandate of the United Nations Mission for the\r\nReferendum in Western Sahara until 14 December 1999.\r\nWe in Madagascar have lived in peace, but we have\r\nalways been aware of the need to preserve the Indian\r\nOcean as a zone of peace, and thus we are concerned\r\nabout the situation in the Comoros, our close neighbour.\r\nWe therefore welcome the opportunity to have hosted, in\r\nApril this year at Antananarivo, the Comorian inter-island\r\nconference, under the aegis of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU). We urge the international community to\r\nmaintain the efforts to implement the Antananarivo accord\r\nso as to bring about a democratic and unified Comorian\r\nstate.\r\nLast year marked the fiftieth anniversary of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. We salute the initiatives\r\nfor cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU\r\nand between the European Union, the OAU and\r\nsubregional organizations such as the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community and the Economic Community\r\nof West African States. Nevertheless, in our view these\r\nactions should be in keeping with the principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, such as respect for the\r\nsovereignty of States, respect for territorial integrity and\r\nnon-intervention in internal affairs.\r\nWhile we recognize the usefulness of peacekeeping\r\noperations, Madagascar considers that disarmament is\r\ninseparable from any effort to consolidate peace. Indeed,\r\nthe increasing deadliness of conflicts is connected with\r\nthe excessive accumulation of light weapons, of which\r\nthere are now an estimated 500 million. In our view the\r\nproblem must be resolved upstream, because practically\r\nall the hotbeds of tension are maintained by the\r\nproduction and sale of such weapons and illicit trafficking\r\nin them. As a party to the international conventions on the\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons and illicit trafficking in\r\nthem, Madagascar supports the idea of an international\r\nconference on the illicit arms trade, in all its aspects.\r\nAs we turn the page on a millennium tarnished by\r\nwars and conflicts, general disarmament must be a\r\ncommon and shared objective. In this regard, on 25\r\nAugust of this year Madagascar associated itself with the\r\nratification of the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. Convinced that there can be no security in a\r\nworld teeming with nuclear, chemical and biological\r\nweapons, Madagascar welcomes the holding next year of\r\nthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nAnother concern of our times is the struggle against\r\ninternational terrorism, a struggle in which we should be\r\nsteadfastly united. This is why we wish to we wish to\r\nsupport the development of a draft international convention\r\nto block the financing of terrorism. Our active participation\r\nat the last OAU summit, held in Algiers, in the adoption of\r\na convention for preventing and fighting terrorism,\r\ndemonstrates our determination to eradicate this scourge.\r\nFurthermore, this very day we have signed the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.\r\nAt a time when all the inhabitants of the planet share\r\nthe desire to live free from the horrors of violence,\r\ndiscrimination and exclusion, respect for democratic\r\nprinciples is no longer just a precept; it has become an\r\nabsolute necessity. We therefore exhort the international\r\ncommunity to condemn firmly any taking of power by non-\r\ndemocratic means. As the principal guarantor of universal\r\nvalues, the United Nations is called upon to take the lead\r\nin this area.\r\nAt the threshold of the twenty-first century, working\r\ntogether to promote human development and human rights\r\nis an obligation. This year, 1999 — the International Year\r\nof Older Persons — is crucial for the implementation of the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing, adopted at Vienna\r\nin 1982. Madagascar therefore welcomes the initiative to\r\nconvene in 2002 a special session of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to the updating of this Plan of Action.\r\nThe right to development is inseparable from the\r\neffective exercise of human rights. It must enjoy\r\ninternational support and solidarity so that development is\r\nextended to all human beings, not just to a privileged\r\nminority. For its part, Madagascar has spared no effort to\r\nstrengthen its institutional capacities. A National Human\r\nRights Commission and an observer office for human rights\r\nhave been established. We have also signed agreements\r\nwith the Office of the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights to assist in promoting human rights.\r\nAware of the revival of transnational traffic in women\r\nand children as well as of modern forms of slavery,\r\nMadagascar adopted on 25 January 1999 a law designed to\r\ncombat paedophilia. Furthermore, we welcome the\r\nconventions produced under the aegis of the International\r\nLabour Organization on the employment of children and\r\nyoung people. Personally, I am happy to have signed the\r\nletter addressed to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfrom all the female Ministers for Foreign Affairs, a letter\r\nthat reiterates our unwavering support for the fight against\r\ntrafficking in human beings, particularly women and\r\nchildren.\r\nFrom one year to the next we are beset by the same\r\nconcerns. We do not wish to call it routine, but our\r\nagenda nevertheless reveals that we must experience the\r\nsame concerns time and again. The century is drawing to\r\nan end without the resolution of two major problems:\r\npoverty and the increase in social inequality. One billion\r\npeople live in extreme poverty, while another billion are\r\nenjoying a life of increasing luxury. Furthermore, a recent\r\nstudy has shown that at the beginning of the next century\r\nwe can expect the ratio of income differential between the\r\nrich and the poor countries to be on the order of 150 to\r\none.\r\nOur claims are therefore as legitimate as ever, while\r\nour efforts at development remain hampered by the\r\ncontinuing and ever-growing deterioration of the terms of\r\ntrade, by our strict dependence on external capital, and by\r\nthe disproportionate concentration of direct foreign\r\ninvestment in economic sectors to which access is\r\nrestricted.\r\nWithout wishing to belittle the advantages of the\r\ninescapable phenomenon of globalization, our fears\r\nremain profound in the face of the emergence of a\r\nunipolar order, which in certain cases promotes\r\nmarginalization, precariousness and insecurity; reduces\r\nour Governments’ room to manoeuvre or capacity to act;\r\nand sometimes even affects our countries’ exercise of\r\ntheir own sovereignty.\r\nWe therefore say “no” to selective globalization\r\nwhen it comes to liberalization, inasmuch as we are being\r\ncalled on to liberalize our trade, investments and financial\r\nflows at an accelerated pace, while this impulse to\r\nliberalize has not been nearly so strong in the case of\r\nproducts of interest to our countries or in the promotion\r\nof access to know-how and technologies.\r\nThe lack of consistency within the new world system\r\nalso applies to the links between our economic adjustment\r\nprogrammes and the various social and environmental\r\nobjectives: the struggle against poverty, the establishment\r\nof basic social infrastructures, the security safety net and\r\nthe protection and development of our environmental\r\nresources.\r\nWhile in no way calling into question the\r\ncommitments undertaken to its development partners,\r\nMadagascar expresses its solidarity with all the\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ndeveloping countries in calling for improved integration\r\nwithin the world economic system, allowing the promotion\r\nof regular and socially harmonious growth with a human\r\nand ecological face.\r\nThe challenges are numerous and varied. The\r\nelimination of poverty remains our priority. We continue to\r\nbelieve that this problem will be resolved only if the pace\r\nof economic growth is accelerated and maintained. The\r\ninternational anti-poverty strategy must include concrete\r\nmeasures to strengthen national efforts in such areas as job\r\ncreation, improved functioning of markets and social and\r\npolitical institutions, and the active participation of\r\nvulnerable groups in development.\r\nThe problem of external debt is a political question of\r\nthe highest importance in international economic relations\r\nand remains a genuine obstacle to the growth of most\r\ndeveloping countries. Arrangements and accords to date\r\nhave provided only limited solutions because of conditions\r\nof eligibility, new conditionalities, selectivity in loan-\r\nmaking, the excessive length of negotiations and constraints\r\nconnected to mandatory circulation.\r\nWe welcome the debt-reduction plan approved recently\r\nat the G-8 Summit in Cologne, but the slow pace at which\r\nthe reduction would seem to yield benefits tends to erode\r\nour hopes. This plan should be interpreted flexibly by the\r\ninternational financial institutions so that it may benefit all\r\ndebtors without exception. The African debt warrants\r\nparticular attention because of these countries’ very limited\r\ncapacity for repayment. Indicators show that the African\r\ncan never be repaid. We therefore call simply for its total\r\ncancellation.\r\nWe are deeply concerned by the reduction of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, which today represents less than\r\none third of the international target agreed more than 20\r\nyears ago. It is urgent that this trend be reversed. Given the\r\nimportance of this question, Madagascar is following with\r\nparticular interest the preparatory work for the international\r\nmeeting on all aspects of development financing. The\r\ndiscussion on reforming the international financial\r\narchitecture is of the greatest interest to us, the objective\r\nbeing to free additional and foreseeable resources for\r\ndevelopment and to strengthen the systems that control,\r\nmonitor and regulate financial flows.\r\nWith regard to international trade, we support the\r\nmessage of the Group of 77 addressed to the forthcoming\r\nmeeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle, as well\r\nas the Marrakesh Declaration with regard to the preparation\r\nof the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD X), scheduled for\r\nBangkok early next year.\r\nThe question of commodities remains a subject of\r\nmajor concern to our countries. We therefore support the\r\nefforts of the relevant international institutions, UNCTAD\r\nin particular, to find more effective machinery that would\r\nallow us to increase our export earnings.\r\nRecognized as a global nature sanctuary because of\r\nthe wealth of its biodiversity, Madagascar remains deeply\r\nconcerned by environmental problems. We follow with\r\ninterest all United Nations activities for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and renew our appeal for increased support\r\nfrom our partners in the implementation of our national\r\nenvironmental programme, currently in phase 2.\r\nTo meet these challenges, we have two options.\r\nFirst, we are convinced that the reform targets we are\r\ncontemplating can be achieved only within the framework\r\nof revitalized international economic cooperation. This\r\nwould require a resumption of the North-South dialogue.\r\nIn this context, major international economic meetings\r\nshould be guided by a spirit of solidarity and a sense of\r\nshare responsibility between the various development\r\npartners. We must therefore advocate a global and\r\nintegrated approach to replace sectoral schemes, which\r\nare necessarily inadequate.\r\nThe second option, which we feel to be a\r\nprerequisite, requires the strengthening of South-South\r\ncooperation. In advance even of the process of integration\r\nwithin the inevitable system of globalization, it is\r\nnatural — even imperative — for the southern countries\r\nto organize themselves. Our progress in this area, being\r\ndispersed and isolated, has proved slow. Of course, we\r\nrecognize that priorities, methods and schedules differ.\r\nWe must concede, however, that the implementation stage\r\nof such cooperation now calls for the much greater unity\r\nand genuine political involvement of member countries.\r\nIn this manner, we envisage a reorganization of the\r\nSouth at all levels — subregional, regional, continental\r\nand global — grouping together all developing countries.\r\nMadagascar is firmly committed to this approach. That is\r\nwhy, at the subregional and regional levels, we are\r\nparticipating within the Indian Ocean Commission in the\r\nimplementation of a regional sustainable development\r\npolicy, to be endorsed by the forthcoming summit of\r\nheads of State and Government on 3 December. As a full\r\nmember of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nAfrica, Madagascar was among the first to decide to apply,\r\non a reciprocal basis, a tariff reduction of 80 per cent for\r\nthe products of member States. This tariff preference is a\r\nprelude to a free-trade zone.\r\nAt the continental level, we welcome the appeal\r\nlaunched at the recent fourth Extraordinary Summit of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity at Sirte for greater economic\r\nintegration in Africa. Indeed, participants in this conference\r\nclearly affirmed that greater unity is one way to resist the\r\nthreat of globalization looming over the continent. Together\r\nwith all African countries, Madagascar urges the\r\ninternational community to lend its material and financial\r\nsupport and to share with our continent its own experiences\r\nin its achievement of unity.\r\nAccording to United Nations resolutions, Africa in the\r\n1990s has been a priority for action against poverty and\r\ninsecurity. In this regard, I welcome the financial\r\ncommitment of $150 million, announced three days ago on\r\n28 September by Mr. James Wolfensohn, President of the\r\nWest Bank, to its Partnership for African Capacity.\r\nThe contribution of every Member State to forging a\r\nnew Africa is an obligation. With this in mind, over the\r\npast three years Madagascar has built a structure that will\r\npromote democracy, human rights and multifaceted\r\ncooperation. An entire field of activity has opened up today,\r\nmaking our big island a major actor in regional, continental\r\nand international life.\r\nThe principle of sharing has been implicit in the\r\nactivities of our Organization since its Charter was written.\r\nWhatever reforms it has undergone and will undergo, we\r\nagree that it is important to preserve among us this noble\r\nprinciple, a rallying cry for our actions. There is also\r\nsharing to be done to reduce economic discrepancies which\r\nhave been growing over the last two decades; sharing to\r\nremedy the asymmetry of trade, if not actually to redefine\r\nsuch trade, and to ensure that such progress is immanent;\r\nand sharing to put an end to the role of war so as to finally\r\ninitiate the role of peace.\r\nWe remain convinced that only the United Nations\r\nwill be a true instigator of the culture of peace, prosperity\r\nand humanism in this world which must be interdependent.\r\nWe share the wish for success in the forthcoming great\r\nmeetings in the year 2000; at Bangkok for the tenth session\r\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment, at Havana for the South Summit, and here in\r\nthis very Hall for the Millennium Summit.\r\nThe President: I call on the Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Philippines, His Excellency Mr. Domingo\r\nSiazon.\r\nMr. Siazon (Philippines): Mr. President, I would\r\nlike to congratulate you as you take on the honour and\r\nresponsibility of leading the Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. Allow me to express our deep appreciation to His\r\nExcellency Minister Didier Opertti, who led us last year\r\nwith admirable efficiency, insight and, on occasion, good\r\nhumour. I take this opportunity also to commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his dedication and inspiring\r\nleadership in the service of our Organization.\r\nI would also like to welcome Presidents Teburoro\r\nTito, Rene Harris and King Taufa’ahau Tupou IV, their\r\ndelegations and the people of Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga,\r\nall fellow members of the Asia-Pacific family, to the\r\nUnited Nations. Their membership in our Organization\r\nshould further bolster the global consensus on peace and\r\nprogress in the world.\r\nAlmost a decade ago the cold war ended and we are\r\ntoday at the doorstep of a new century. Over those years,\r\nwe achieved much as individual nations and as Members\r\nof this Organization. Yet, our collective search for peace\r\nand progress for all continues. After many years of\r\neloquent debates, after hearing many persuasive proposals\r\nand formulations, how well indeed have we mastered the\r\nlanguage of peace. But the wars and strife that afflict our\r\nworld, even as we speak, show that we have neither fully\r\nlearned nor lived the ways of peace. As at its founding,\r\nour Organization is faced with the dire spectre of\r\ncountless multitudes living in utter dread and misery.\r\nThe much-touted new global order, where nations\r\nlive in harmony and peace, where growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment are rights and not privileges and where\r\njustice rules and human rights are upheld remains a\r\npromise. We encounter newer threats to the peace, and\r\nold threats are re-emerging. Poverty stalks many lands.\r\nFar too many people have their human rights ignored or\r\nviolated. Our very Earth protests decades of unbridled\r\nabuse.\r\nOne of the clear victors at the end of the cold war\r\nwas the free market. For most of our lives, the assault\r\nupon the very idea and practice of the free market came\r\nfrom an ideology. Today, even that ideology embraces the\r\nmethods, if not the spirit, of the free market. It now\r\nseems that the growing reach of the free market, or\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nglobalization, is held back only by our inability to adapt to\r\nit fast enough.\r\nFor so many years, East Asia was admired for its\r\nsuccess with globalization. The so-called East Asian miracle\r\nwas little more than our region’s economic response to it.\r\nOur fast growth doubled our incomes and moved tens of\r\nmillions of our people out of poverty. Up until July 1997,\r\nwe thought all was well.\r\nNow we know better; we have learned our lessons.\r\nOur difficulties could have been less severe or avoided with\r\nbetter public and corporate governance, with better\r\nmanagement of financial systems, with greater transparency\r\nand accountability; in other words, with greater openness,\r\nwhich is the heart and spirit of the free market or any truly\r\nfree system.\r\nHappily, the crisis did not destroy the conditions\r\nunderpinning East Asia’s growth formula of\r\noutward-oriented industrialization. A propensity for high\r\nsavings, abundant highly educated human resources, higher\r\nproductivity and economic reform policies remain.\r\nToday, East Asia is on the road to recovery. Consumer\r\nconfidence is rising. Exports are booming. Inflation has\r\nbeen tamed. Investors are coming back. Japan, the Republic\r\nof Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia are all growing\r\nagain. The Philippine economy will grow by more than 3\r\npercent this year and over 5 percent next year. Yet, there is\r\nno retreat on our core reform agenda. Economic\r\nrestructurings continue. Greater economic integration goes\r\non. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\ncountries, for instance, took extraordinary steps to\r\nunderscore their commitment to free trade and investment.\r\nDuring its Hanoi summit last year, ASEAN resolved to\r\naccelerate, not retard, the establishment of the ASEAN free\r\ntrade area to the year 2002. We are accelerating the\r\nimplementation of the ASEAN Investment Area and\r\nASEAN Industrial Cooperation schemes. We have also\r\nmoved towards greater financial cooperation by establishing\r\nat the Asian Development Bank a regional economic\r\nmonitoring and surveillance mechanism. It should\r\nencourage transparency, institute better coordination of\r\neconomic policies and help ward off future financial crises.\r\nHowever, internal reforms cannot be enough. The\r\ncrisis also exposed the weaknesses lurking in the\r\ninternational system. Realizing early on that the\r\nphenomenon of globalization should be addressed\r\nmultilaterally, the United Nations has sought the\r\ncooperation of other multilateral organizations to strengthen\r\nnormative, legal and institutional frameworks in the hope\r\nthat the global economy can be managed more effectively\r\nand, perhaps more importantly, more equitably. For the\r\nyawning gap between poor and rich nations continues to\r\nwiden, and the pace and level of development of countries\r\nare, alas, more uneven.\r\nIn a fast-globalizing and interdependent world,\r\naugmenting the ability of developing countries to\r\nparticipate fully in the global economy is the win-win\r\nsolution for all. Insecure market access, high levels of\r\nprotection and support of agriculture in industrialized\r\ncountries and the continued high tariffs on industrial\r\nproducts from developing countries obviate greater\r\nprogress for all.\r\nThe international trading system must adopt a new\r\nparadigm in which sustainable development should be the\r\ncentral theme. The World Trade Organization Ministerial\r\nConference to be held in Seattle late this year should be\r\nnot only an opportunity to launch a new round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations. It should also be an\r\noccasion to imbue the process with a sense of direction\r\nthat responds to the development needs of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe global financial architecture must be\r\nstrengthened. There is urgent need, as the Committee for\r\nDevelopment Policy pointed out in its 1998 report to the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, for the coherent\r\ndevelopment and effective monitoring of international\r\nstandards and codes of conduct for private financial\r\nmanagement and capital flows. There is also need to curb\r\ndestructive competition and inconsistency in national\r\nregulatory frameworks.\r\nMore and more, countries and regions need to reach\r\nout to one another in the spirit of cooperation and\r\npartnership for development. The ten-year-old\r\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, or APEC, is\r\nfounded on this conviction. So is the much younger\r\nAsia-Europe Meeting, or ASEM. And it heartens us that\r\nthe East Asia-Latin America Forum, having recently taken\r\nits first steps, may soon join in the more sustained and\r\nstructured effort to link up for global progress. The\r\nPhilippines anticipates a similar region-to-region initiative\r\nwith Africa and will contribute its utmost to any such\r\ninitiative.\r\nFrom a historical perspective, we are still at the very\r\nearly stage of globalization. With globalization having the\r\npotential to grow exponentially, as do the revolutions in\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ntechnology and information that fuel it, this early stage is\r\nperhaps the most critical one. Only earnest international\r\ncooperation can ensure that this process does not lead to the\r\nmarginalization of any nation.\r\nBut, as our recent experience in East Asia shows,\r\neconomic progress alone cannot and does not engender the\r\noptimal well-being of nations or peoples. Progress in\r\nensuring political stability and security should accompany\r\ngrowth. Any asymmetry in the pace, breadth and depth of\r\nchange in these facets of the political economy is a seed of\r\nfuture instability. Moreover, just as our economic prospects\r\nare determined by our participation in the global economy,\r\nour future peace and security will depend not only on our\r\ninternal resilience, but also on the active cooperation of\r\nothers.\r\nIn East Asia the most urgent undertaking for ensuring\r\npeace is the reconfiguration of the strategic security\r\nstructure in the region. The holes left gaping by the end of\r\nthe cold war must be filled; the new parameters of the\r\nregional security equation must be defined. The situation in\r\nthe Taiwan Strait is a concern to us all. So are the issues of\r\nmissile development in the Korean peninsula and nuclear\r\ndevelopment and uneasy peace in South Asia.\r\nThe South China Sea remains a potential flashpoint.\r\nWe are hopeful that, in addition to measures advancing\r\nregional economic and financial cooperation, a regional\r\ncode of conduct in the South China Sea can be adopted at\r\nthe summit of leaders of ASEAN, China, Japan and the\r\nRepublic of Korea that we are hosting in Manila in\r\nNovember.\r\nEast Asia has clearly not yet settled all its great issues\r\nof war and peace. But we are trying hard and succeeding in\r\nsome important ways. At the sixth ASEAN Regional\r\nForum — the only forum on security that includes all the\r\nmajor Powers with a stake in our region — we agreed to\r\ndraft rules of procedure by which preventive diplomacy\r\ncould bolster and complement regional confidence-building\r\nmeasures. Last December we agreed to move closer to the\r\nfull activation of the ASEAN High Council and the dispute\r\nsettlement mechanisms mandated by the Treaty of Amity\r\nand Cooperation in Southeast Asia.\r\nThe 5 May 1999 Agreement on East Timor and the\r\nfree, fair and orderly conduct of the 30 August\r\nconsultations there are truly significant developments for\r\nlasting peace in our region. For the Philippines, it is of the\r\nutmost importance that the chaos there be quickly resolved\r\nand the horrendous human suffering be stanched. We\r\ntherefore welcome Indonesia’s decision to invite the\r\nassistance of the United Nations and of a multinational\r\nforce, and its creation of a national commission of inquiry\r\nto investigate and bring to justice persons responsible for\r\nthe atrocities and human rights violations in East Timor.\r\nWe also commend the Secretary-General and the\r\nneighbouring and other countries for responding quickly\r\nto restore order and facilitate humanitarian relief in East\r\nTimor. As a fraternal neighbour of the peoples of\r\nIndonesia and East Timor, we will contribute all we can\r\nto ameliorate the humanitarian situation and put back on\r\ntrack a peaceful transition.\r\nElsewhere, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement is a\r\npositive development for the Middle East peace process.\r\nWe are also heartened by the agreements reached recently\r\nin Sierra Leone and the Congo, and between Eritrea and\r\nEthiopia. We hope that the resolution of the immediate\r\ncrisis in Kosovo will soon create the conditions conducive\r\nto the establishment of lasting peace there.\r\nIt is true that we have avoided major inter-State\r\nconflicts of late, and that States are more willing to\r\nresolve disputes peacefully. But the continuing tensions in\r\nvarious regions of the world could still draw nations into\r\nconflict and divert attention and resources away from\r\ndevelopment. For the Philippines, regional cooperation\r\nprovides a key to managing potential and actual conflict\r\nsituations. We have seen this in the efforts of the ASEAN\r\ntroika, the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity to restore political stability in Cambodia, and\r\nin the dispatch of a multinational force to East Timor\r\nwith authorization from the Security Council and upon the\r\ninvitation of the Indonesian Government.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that it is\r\nnecessary and desirable to provide support for regional\r\nand subregional arrangements and initiatives on matters of\r\ninternational peace and security. The United Nations,\r\nlacking the capacity, resources and expertise to address all\r\nissues unique to each region of the world, should\r\ncomplement rather than supplant regional peace efforts.\r\nThis, however, will require significant investment\r\nfrom all of us. In the first instance, we need to invest a\r\nlot of goodwill and build trust in one another so that\r\nclearer criteria and a more predictable basis can guide\r\nSecurity Council authorization for all types of peace\r\nmissions. We realize that no two situations are the same,\r\nbut inaction due to stalemates in the Council, in the face\r\nof serious threats to peace and human life, threatens the\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ncredibility, legitimacy and future effectiveness of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nSecondly, the Organization and its Member States\r\nneed to invest in practical steps that can be taken in the\r\nareas of training assistance, joint peacekeeping exercises,\r\ngreater participation in standby arrangements, partnerships\r\nbetween countries whose contingents require equipment\r\nsupport and those able to provide it, and closer cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations.\r\nAnd thirdly, perhaps more important, we need to\r\ninvest our work and way of thinking with greater flexibility\r\nand innovation. The nature of conflict has changed. Crises\r\nand humanitarian situations now involve many more actors,\r\nfrom Governments and international organizations to non-\r\nState players. And their effects, just like their causes, are\r\nmore complex and far-reaching.\r\nLet us face it, much of what was considered before as\r\nthe internal affairs of a State is not so any more — or ever.\r\nHumanity is indivisible. Peace is indivisible.\r\nState sovereignty is important; it will always be. So is\r\nindividual sovereignty. That the redefinition of one should\r\ncoincide with the renewed consciousness of the other is, to\r\nmy delegation, not an accident. These developments need\r\nnot even be seen as parallel, as in they do not meet; for in\r\ntruth, they converge.\r\nBut we agree with the Secretary-General that the more\r\nimportant question is how the United Nations — the only\r\ntruly universal, if imperfect, arm of the international\r\ncommunity — is to respond to the political, human rights\r\nand humanitarian crises affecting so much of the world. We\r\nhave to be more innovative in our approaches to problems\r\nrelating to massive and systematic human rights violations.\r\nWe agree that empowering the United Nations enough to\r\nmatch its Charter mandates in today’s and tomorrow’s\r\nworld requires that we, the Member States, update our\r\nconcept of national interest.\r\nLast year, before this Assembly, I articulated\r\nPhilippine policy, thus:\r\n“Like all other States, the Philippines pursues\r\nforeign policy to promote national security and\r\ndevelopment. But we view national security beyond\r\nthe traditional concerns of sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity. For in a global regime characterized by\r\nevolving multipolarity of political and military power\r\nand by growing economic and financial\r\ninterdependence, with all their attendant\r\nopportunities and risks, my nation’s peace and\r\nprosperity increasingly depend on stability and\r\ngrowth abroad. As President Estrada has said: Our\r\nway of life, our fundamental values and our\r\ninstitutions can flourish and find true expression\r\nonly if we enjoy political stability, economic\r\nsolidarity, socio-cultural cohesion, moral consensus\r\nand ecological balance, at home and with our\r\npartners in the world. Our national security and\r\ndevelopment” [or in short, our national interest]\r\n“demand that we actively advance the internationally\r\nshared goals of freedom, openness, peace, prosperity\r\nand justice.” (A/53/PV.17, p.6)\r\nAfter the events of the last year, we are more\r\nconvinced that the collective interest, our common\r\ninterest, is my country’s national interest.\r\nThe need to reform the United Nations is our\r\ncommon interest. Reforms should not only seek to make\r\nthe United Nations more efficient; they should make it\r\ntruly responsive to the new demands of international\r\npeace, security and development.\r\nThe Security Council, with its wide mandate and\r\nleadership role, should be at the centre of change and\r\nreform itself. It should be truly representative, democratic,\r\ntransparent and accountable. The use of the veto should\r\nbe rationalized.\r\nThe day may come when we shall have achieved\r\nconsensus on the reforms that we wish for our\r\nOrganization. The day may also come — and soon I\r\nhope — that the financial morass our Organization is in\r\nwill have passed.\r\nBut while these are critical to the very survival of\r\nthe United Nations, the continued existence of our\r\nOrganization would be far more meaningful if we could\r\ninvest it with a new openness and greater trust. The\r\nPhilippines believes that to achieve this, we must start at\r\nhome, in our own regions. We must, in appropriate\r\ncircumstances, be more open to hearing the views of\r\nothers and offering our own, even on issues deemed too\r\ncontroversial. A new openness would reflect the boldness\r\nwith which we should renew the promise of a new era.\r\nThe United Nations proved its great worth in this\r\ncentury. Its continued success in the next will depend\r\nentirely on us, on the goals we hope to achieve with it, on\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nwhat we are willing to invest in it. After all, we are the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Assistant Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Vanuatu, His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Clement Leo.\r\nMr. Leo (Vanuatu): On behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Vanuatu, I wish to join\r\nprevious speakers in congratulating you, Mr. President, on\r\nyour election to this high and important post. Your\r\nunanimous election as President of the fifty-fourth session\r\nof General Assembly shows the esteem in which the\r\ninternational community holds both you, personally, and\r\nyour country, Namibia. The Republic of Vanuatu’s\r\ndelegation is confident that you will guide the session to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion.\r\nMay I take this opportunity, through you, to express\r\nmy delegation’s sincere appreciation on your predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for his\r\noutstanding stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-\r\nthird session.\r\nI wish to commend our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his wise leadership and dedication to the reform\r\nand restructuring of our Organization. Through you,\r\nMr. President, we would like to assure him of our support.\r\nFour years ago, we gathered here to celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization — in particular, to\r\nrenew our commitment to the fundamental principles which\r\ncreated it in 1945.\r\nWe have also made strong a commitment to further\r\nstrengthen our collaborative and genuine efforts in ensuring\r\nthat this Organization continues to promote global peace,\r\njustice, healthy environment, human rights, law and order,\r\nand support the process of sustainable development of its\r\nMember nations — in particular, the least developed\r\ncountries (LDCs) such as those in the Pacific region,\r\nincluding the Republic of Vanuatu.\r\nThe current international political and economic\r\nsituation has grown ever more complex and demanding on\r\nour very limited and scarce resources as well as on the\r\nsupport available from our development partners.\r\nWe are deeply concerned by the continuing escalation\r\nof international crimes of all sorts — drug trafficking,\r\nmoney laundering, human rights violations, terrorism,\r\norganized crime and other similar activities which have the\r\npotential of placing the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of small island States at great risk. The\r\ninternational community must be seen to genuinely\r\ncollaborate in combating these criminal phenomena if the\r\nnew philosophy of globalization is to positively progress\r\nand if we are to advance into the new millennium with\r\nfresh and renewed hope to build a better future for our\r\nchildren.\r\nWe do not believe that the world is doing us justice\r\nand the fundamental principles of peace and economic\r\nprosperity as enshrined in the Charter if we do not\r\nobserve our joint call for disarmament of nuclear weapons\r\nand other weapons of mass destruction. International\r\nsecurity cannot be guaranteed if we fail to accord priority\r\nattention and resources to education, protection of the\r\nenvironment and good Heath of humankind and its\r\nsurvival into the next millennium.\r\nAs a small island developing State where the ocean\r\nprovides one of the most important parts of our food\r\nchain, we would like to join others in voicing our main\r\nconcern regarding the management of our oceans and\r\nseas. Our participation at the Second London Oceans\r\nWorkshop last December demonstrated this. We would\r\ntherefore join other nations in calling for a collective\r\naffirmation by all respective Member States at this session\r\nof the General Assembly for a resolution to establish a\r\nconsultative process to improve coordination and\r\nmanagement of programmes that are associated with the\r\nprotection of the oceans and the seas which are very dear\r\nto our very survival. This year my Government acceded\r\nto and ratified three International Maritime Organization\r\nConventions which again reflects our concern for the\r\nprotection of our oceans and seas.\r\nThe momentum of the fiftieth anniversary of our\r\nOrganization, and the lessons we have learned from past\r\nmistakes and our renewed commitment must guide us in\r\nour pursuit for a better world where, through this\r\nOrganization, a renewed sense of mutual trust and\r\ngenuine dialogue can he resurrected to ease the political\r\ntensions and economic crisis in all the regions and\r\nsub-regions of the planet.\r\nMr. Gambari (Nigeria), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nFor our part of the world, these new developments\r\nconstitute a real threat to the already vulnerable\r\nenvironment of our small island economies and our\r\npopulation. Confronted with these challenges, many\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ncountries in the Pacific Region, including Vanuatu, do not\r\nhave much choice at the end of the century but to embark\r\non difficult programmes of reform, both within their\r\nrespective Governments and societies.\r\nLast year, The Honourable Donald Kalpokas Masike\r\nVanua, Prime Minister of Vanuatu, informed the Assembly\r\nthat Vanuatu had initiated a Comprehensive Reform\r\nProgramme with the support of both multilateral and\r\nbilateral donor agencies and countries. As we are still in the\r\nimplementation stage of our reform, it is our genuine hope\r\nthat it will not only be beneficial to our people but also\r\nresponsive to their needs, in particular those of the 80 per\r\ncent who live in the rural areas on subsistence farming.\r\nTherefore Vanuatu would continue to need the special\r\nsupport being accorded to it as a least developed country.\r\nThe role of Mr. Gurirab’s predecessor and of the\r\nSecretary-General in subsequently facilitating a constructive\r\ndialogue and comprehensive appreciation of the economic\r\nhardships of Vanuatu must be commended, and it is our\r\nhope that this will continue as we enter the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nIn this regard, the Government and the people of\r\nVanuatu warmly welcome the recent decision of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, at its recent meeting in\r\nGeneva this year, to defer consideration of Vanuatu’s\r\ngraduation from least developed country status, pending full\r\nassessment of the usefulness of the vulnerability index and\r\necological fragility as criteria for least developed country\r\ndesignation.\r\nIn this connection, I am pleased to inform the\r\nAssembly that with the assistance of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), my\r\nGovernment will be carrying out a review of our situation\r\nin Vanuatu which we hope will assist the Committee for\r\nDevelopment Planning in its endeavour to come up with\r\ncriteria that will hopefully be accepted and adopted to\r\ndetermine the status of most least developed countries. We\r\nwould like to register our most sincere appreciation and\r\nrecognition to each and every country and group of\r\ncountries for their continuous support.\r\nOne of the commitments we all made during the\r\nfiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995 was that our\r\nOrganization ought to be reformed and restructured in a\r\nmanner that reflects reality and the problems we are\r\ncurrently experiencing, so that it could be effective in\r\naddressing the issues and needs of its Member States, both\r\nindividually and as a group. On this note, we want to\r\nassociate ourselves with earlier statements in reference to\r\nreform and restructuring, in particular on the issue of\r\ngeographical location. Here we are referring specifically\r\nto our close neighbours, Australia and New Zealand,\r\nwhich are considered as part of the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nFrom our perspective — shared, we have no doubt,\r\nby others — the United Nations must include in its\r\nreform agenda a full assessment and recognition of the\r\ninherent particularities of small island States like the\r\nRepublic of Vanuatu and the impact of the international\r\neconomic crisis, in particular that of globalization, on\r\ntheir economic performance and on the sustainability of\r\ntheir political stability.\r\nThe pursuit and promotion of a free and responsible\r\npress, the protection of individual rights and gender\r\nequality, as noted in Mr. Gurirab’s opening remarks, are\r\nmatters which are receiving more attention under the\r\nreform programme. These are real challenges to Vanuatu\r\ntoday, but they are challenges which we are confident we\r\nwill successfully address over time, with the necessary\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nThe right of self-determination must also continue to\r\noccupy our agenda. As the United Nations International\r\nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism ends next year,\r\nit is my Government’s hope that all administering Powers\r\nof the countries concerned will take appropriate steps, in\r\ncooperation with the territories, to work out some time-\r\nframe for those countries to exercise their inalienable\r\nright self-determination, self-government or independence.\r\nThe United Nations, as mandated by its Charter, must be\r\nseen to encourage and support dialogue at the appropriate\r\npolitical levels in the regions and countries where human\r\nsuffering and social disorder continue as a direct result of\r\nconflicts of opinion on the issue of self-determination.\r\nIn the Pacific region, while we warmly welcomed\r\nthe signing last year of the Nouméa Accord between the\r\nFrench Government and the major political parties in New\r\nCaledonia, we urge all parties concerned to uphold their\r\ncommitment in relation to the rights and wishes of the\r\nindigenous population of New Caledonia. We welcome\r\nthe decision by the French Government to allow\r\nrepresentatives from the South Pacific Forum and\r\nrepresentatives of the United Nations Special Political and\r\nDecolonization Committee to visit the Territory in August\r\nof this year, as outlined in resolution 53/65. We believe\r\nthis new agreement and the latest developments will help\r\nto foster a stronger sense of commitment in all parties to\r\nwork together to support an irreversible trend for the\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nfuture political status of New Caledonia — that is, its\r\nself-determination.\r\nStill in our region, while the East Timorese people\r\nhave finally realized their right to self-determination, my\r\nGovernment notes with grave concern the deteriorating\r\nsituation in East Timor following the results of the ballot at\r\nthe end of August in which many human rights violations\r\nhave been noted and many innocent people have lost their\r\nlives. However, my Government is pleased to note the\r\ninitiatives taken by the Government of Indonesia to allow\r\nthe deployment of a Security Council peacekeeping force in\r\nthe troubled area and to assist in restoring normalcy and\r\nallowing the democratic process to take its course.\r\nAs I said earlier on, the world and our Organization\r\nwill be going through very challenging times as we prepare\r\nto turn the page of this century and start a new one. The\r\ncredibility of the United Nations in the next millennium\r\nwill be measured in terms of its effectiveness in responding\r\nto the real situations prevailing in its Member States,\r\nespecially in small island States. The recent admission of\r\nour Pacific Island neighbours, namely the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga,\r\nto this body is a manifestation of this, and we hope that\r\ntheir admission not only increases the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations but also that they will bring with them new\r\nideas to contribute to this important Organization. As small\r\nisland States, we feel that our problems will be addressed\r\nadequately and be heard in an international Organization\r\nlike the United Nations, and we join others in welcoming\r\nthem to our family of nations.\r\nTo conclude, let me say that it is therefore vital that\r\nwe all support and supplement the process of reform\r\nspearheaded by our Secretary-General, which is aimed not\r\nonly at streamlining our Organization but also at\r\nstrengthening it. As we approach the dawn of the new\r\nmillennium, with its unforeseen challenges, cooperation will\r\nno doubt be required between all Members in order that we\r\nmay discuss and debate our common issues in this very\r\nvenue.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Tofik Zulfugarov.\r\nMr. Zulfugarov (Azerbaijan): Allow me first of all to\r\nsincerely congratulate Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his\r\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session and to express\r\nconfidence that under his skilful leadership the Assembly\r\nwill cope successfully with the complex issues before it.\r\nI would like also to commend the President of the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly, Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti, on his remarkable commitment to the success of\r\nthe session.\r\nI wish also to congratulate and to welcome the new\r\nMembers of our Organization — the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nSpeaking from this lofty rostrum, representatives of\r\nthe States Members of the United Nations are trying to\r\ncommunicate to their colleagues and the international\r\ncommunity the most pressing problems that their\r\ncountries face. The truth, which is not always pleasant, is\r\nexpressed here with hope for justice, understanding and\r\nsupport.\r\nStates, including the Republic of Azerbaijan, that\r\nhave regained their freedom and now face threats to their\r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, count\r\non the support of the international community. They are\r\nalso deeply concerned about the current difficulties of the\r\nOrganization. Member States look to the United Nations\r\nwith trust and hope. This places on the Organization an\r\nimportant responsibility for finding a way out of the\r\ncurrent complex situation.\r\nIn this connection, the Republic of Azerbaijan\r\nactively supports the United Nations reform process,\r\nwhich our times demand. We believe that a transformed\r\nOrganization, adapted to modern realities, will be in a\r\nposition to cope with an increasing number of challenges\r\nand risks to international peace and security.\r\nThreats to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\nsecurity of the Member States of the United Nations have\r\nbecome appallingly routine. States often face aggression,\r\nmilitary occupation, “ethnic cleansing”, separatism and\r\nterrorism. A conflict that is not dealt with in a timely and\r\nresolute manner is later transformed into a humanitarian\r\ndisaster that brings about a very sensitive reaction on the\r\npart of the international community.\r\nGiven the resolute action by the international\r\ncommunity in the Balkans, the situation with regard to the\r\nunresolved or frozen conflicts in other regions seems\r\nespecially tragic. We consider it unacceptable to set\r\npriorities in this respect, and wish to draw the attention of\r\nthe international community to the intolerable fact that\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\none fifth of the territory of a sovereign Member State of the\r\nUnited Nations — the Republic of Azerbaijan — has\r\ncontinued to be under foreign occupation for more than six\r\nyears and that, as a result of “ethnic cleansing”, one out of\r\nseven of its citizens is a refugee or displaced person in his\r\nown country.\r\nThe clear trend towards putting up with the behaviour\r\nof the aggressor and sometimes even conniving at his\r\nattempts to legalize the situation in the conflict zone, as\r\nwell as the eagerness of some mediators to reach an easy\r\nsettlement on the basis that the “ethnic cleansing” of the\r\nAzerbaijani population and the occupation of its territories\r\nis a fait accompli, will only lead to continued tension and\r\nfurther delay the prospects for a settlement of the conflict\r\nand the restoration of durable peace and stability in the\r\nregion, based on the norms and principles of international\r\nlaw.\r\nThe only valid premise for a lasting settlement of\r\nconflicts is a timely display of determination and solidarity\r\nby the international community, first and foremost by the\r\nUnited Nations, which has primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, for the\r\nprotection and observation of the norms and principles of\r\ninternational law and for making every effort to secure the\r\nimplementation of decisions taken.\r\nLike other countries facing aggression and militant\r\nseparatism, Azerbaijan rejects settlement models that\r\ninfringe on its sovereignty, territorial integrity and the unity\r\nof its State and run counter to its national interests. An\r\nexample is the concept of the common State, which was\r\nproposed as a model for settlement in the context of certain\r\nconflicts, but failed to find the support of the countries\r\nconcerned. That concept is pernicious, because it attempts\r\nto distort the notion of statehood and State sovereignty; in\r\nfact, it is an attempt to provide a legal framework for the\r\nideology of militant separatism.\r\nIt goes without saying that an important factor in any\r\nsettlement is the readiness of the parties involved to find a\r\ncompromise. At the same time, by definition, compromise\r\nimplies reciprocity and clear limits. Seeking a realistic\r\nformula for a compromise based on adherence to the norms\r\nand principles of international law, taking into account\r\nnational and State interests, the President of Azerbaijan,\r\nHeydar Aliyev, has maintained direct contact and held talks\r\nwith the President of Armenia, Robert Kocharian. It is\r\nAzerbaijan’s hope that this approach can open new\r\npossibilities to steer the settlement process out of the\r\ndeadlock that we have witnessed during the past year.\r\nIt is now possible to speak about the achievement of\r\na positive climate, which should be complemented with\r\nmore active work by the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, which is\r\nresponsible for the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan\r\nconflict, so that the negotiation process can be resumed in\r\nthe near future. We regard it as absolutely unjustified that\r\nsome members of the Minsk Group use the fact that there\r\nare direct contacts between Azerbaijan and Armenia as an\r\nexcuse for their stepping aside from the process and for\r\ntheir inactivity. In this connection, we call upon the\r\nCo-Chairmen of the Minsk Group to make every effort\r\nnecessary to bring about in the near future a revised\r\nproposal for the settlement of the conflict that would\r\nrepresent an acceptable combination of elements.\r\nIt will be necessary effectively to use the time\r\nremaining before the OSCE summit in Istanbul in order\r\nto come closer to achieving concrete results. It is\r\nextremely important that the consistency and\r\ndetermination of the international community be\r\nmaintained in advocating its declared positions on the\r\nsettlement of the conflict between Armenia and\r\nAzerbaijan. We believe, in particular, that the sequence of\r\nsteps provided for in the Security Council resolutions on\r\nthe conflict continues to be optimal.\r\nAzerbaijan reaffirms its commitment to a peaceful\r\nsettlement and unconditional implementation of the\r\nceasefire until a political agreement on the cessation of\r\nthe conflict is concluded. Guided by a spirit of goodwill\r\nand a sincere desire to reach progress in the settlement\r\nprocess, on 18 September 1999, during the visit of Knut\r\nVollebaek, the Chairman-in-office of the OSCE, the\r\nPresident of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, announced the\r\nunilateral release of all Armenian prisoners of war held in\r\nAzerbaijan. We expect an adequate reaction from the\r\nArmenian side in the near future.\r\nAzerbaijan supports the reform process in the\r\nOrganization, based on the proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General and the decisions of the General\r\nAssembly. Reform of the Security Council continues to\r\nbe the priority problem. Azerbaijan fully agrees with the\r\napproach reflected in resolution 53/30, in accordance with\r\nwhich any decisions on this issue would require the\r\npositive vote of a minimum of two thirds of the Member\r\nStates.\r\nWe still believe that the representation of the States\r\nof Asia, Africa and Latin America in all membership\r\ncategories of the Security Council should reflect modern\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\npolitical realities. Azerbaijan reconfirms its support for the\r\nelection of Germany and Japan as permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council. We continue to believe that, together\r\nwith that, objective reality calls for the allocation of one\r\nadditional non-permanent seat to the Eastern European\r\nGroup.\r\nWith regard to the reform and strengthening of the\r\neffectiveness of the work of the Security Council, I cannot\r\nfail to draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that\r\nthe four resolutions adopted by the Security Council on the\r\nArmenia-Azerbaijan conflict, resolutions 822 (1993), 853\r\n(1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993), have still not been\r\nimplemented. We believe that the lack of an adequate\r\nreaction to the violation of the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and the non-compliance with decisions\r\nadopted within the United Nations is seriously undermining\r\nthe image of the world Organization.\r\nAzerbaijan welcomes the increased attention of the\r\nSecurity Council to acute humanitarian problems in conflict\r\nsituations, and supports the inclusion in the mandate of\r\npeacekeeping forces of concrete and adequate provisions for\r\nthe demilitarization of conflict zones and the disarmament\r\nof combatants, as well as of special provisions on the\r\nprotection of and support for the civilian population,\r\nincluding women and children.\r\nIllegal arms transfers to conflict zones make the\r\nprospects for settlement more remote and aggravate\r\nhumanitarian disasters. Recently this has become a pressing\r\nproblem which requires special attention and specific joint\r\naction by the international community. In this context,\r\nbreaches of the relevant provisions of Security Council\r\nresolutions, especially by some of the Council’s own\r\nmembers, are unacceptable. Azerbaijan supports convening\r\nan international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its\r\naspects not later than 2001.\r\nWe attach great importance to the timely convening of\r\na fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted\r\nto disarmament, which could determine the future course of\r\naction in the field of disarmament, arms control and related\r\ninternational security matters.\r\nAzerbaijan stands by the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer\r\nof Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, and\r\nwelcomes its entry into force; we welcome also the\r\noutcome of the First Meeting of States Parties, held in\r\nMaputo. A national agency in this sphere has been created\r\nin Azerbaijan; it has begun its activities and has started to\r\nestablish cooperation with its international counterparts.\r\nAzerbaijan’s formal accession to the Convention is\r\ndirectly dependent on the issue of the continuing\r\noccupation of its territory by Armenia.\r\nAzerbaijan has a highly positive view of the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, and\r\nsupports the work of the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nInternational Criminal Court on a number of provisions of\r\nits Statute. We regard as very important the work being\r\ndone by the Commission to define the crime of\r\naggression, and believe that the definition should be clear\r\nand viable, and that it should make provision for a norm\r\nestablishing personal criminal responsibility. As a victim\r\nof aggression, Azerbaijan maintains that the Court should\r\nbecome an effective organ for the prosecution of those\r\nwho commit crimes against humanity.\r\nMy country is interested in taking an active part in\r\ncombatting international terrorism, organized crime and\r\nillegal drug trafficking. The fight against these evils can\r\nbe effective only if it is based on joint efforts by all\r\ncountries, at both the regional and the global levels. We\r\nsupport the idea of convening in 2000 an anti-terrorist\r\nconference or a special session of the General Assembly\r\non this issue, and the elaboration of a declaration of\r\nprinciples on the interaction of States in combatting\r\nterrorism. We hope that the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) will be able to mobilize additional\r\nresources to continue the joint project on drug-abuse\r\ncontrol of the UNDP, the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme and the Government of\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nAnother emerging topical area of activities is the\r\nprovision of humanitarian relief assistance in emergency\r\nsituations and periods of natural disasters, such as those\r\nthat we have witnessed in recent months. In this\r\nconnection, Azerbaijan calls for increased assistance to\r\nthe victims of the tragic earthquake in brotherly Turkey,\r\nwhich claimed thousands of human lives.\r\nDespite the objective difficulties caused by the\r\narmed conflict and the transitional period, Azerbaijan\r\nbelieves that there is no alternative to its chosen course of\r\nreform aimed at building a democratic society with a\r\nmarket economy. As a State located at a key point\r\nbetween Europe and Asia, Azerbaijan is keenly interested\r\nin securing access to trans-European and trans-Asian\r\ncommunication networks; this would facilitate the\r\ndevelopment of industrial and trade links among\r\nparticipating countries, improved access to markets,\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nincreased integration links, and closer cooperation among\r\nthe economies of European and Asian countries.\r\nUnfortunately, the process of the profound\r\ntransformation of the national economy is facing the serious\r\nconsequences of the presence in the country of 1 million\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons. Coping with this\r\nemergency situation has been a primary concern of the\r\nAzerbaijan State for many years. Given the limited financial\r\nresources of our State, humanitarian assistance from the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations is a\r\nnecessary element not only of the physical, but also of the\r\nmoral survival of people who have lost their homes. We\r\nwould like to express our most sincere gratitude to the\r\nUnited Nations, to the relevant United Nations agencies and\r\nto donor countries providing humanitarian assistance to\r\nAzerbaijan, and we call upon them not to reduce the\r\nvolume of that assistance.\r\nAllow me to touch briefly upon the role that the\r\nUnited Nations and its agencies are playing in Azerbaijan.\r\nAt the last session, I spoke about the constructive work\r\nbeing done with respect to the social and economic\r\ndevelopment of our country by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme. The UNDP is actively assisting\r\nthe Government of Azerbaijan and bilateral and multilateral\r\nhumanitarian organizations in addressing development\r\nissues. At the same time, my Government is deeply\r\nconcerned at the fact that UNDP is entering the new\r\nmillennium with an extremely decreased financial base. We\r\nall need a UNDP able to cope with the development\r\nproblems that we are not in a position to solve alone. All\r\nparticipants in this process — donors and recipients of\r\nassistance — should provide sincere and solid support to\r\nthe development activities of the United Nations.\r\nIn this context, I would like to call upon all concerned\r\nto improve significantly the very difficult current financial\r\nsituation of the Organization.\r\nWith reference to relations between my country and\r\nthe United Nations in general, I would like again to draw\r\nattention to the fact that Azerbaijan is still not represented\r\nin the United Nations Secretariat.\r\nThe world is tired of crises and wars. Mankind\r\ndeserves a peaceful, prosperous and happy new millennium.\r\nOur Organization is designed to play a leading role in\r\novercoming obstacles to global peace and progress. It must\r\nbe in a position to implement that noble mission. This is\r\nnot an abstract desire, but a realistic task based on an\r\nassessment of the situation and an awareness of both\r\nneeds and possibilities.\r\nThe Acting President: I call now on the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mauritania, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ahmed Ould Sid Ahmed.\r\nMr. Ould Sid Ahmed (Mauritania) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the outset, I wish, on behalf of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Mauritania, to congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election to the presidency\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I am\r\nconvinced that his experience and his wisdom will enable\r\nhim to guide the work of the session to a successful\r\nconclusion. My delegation assures him of its complete\r\ncooperation in that noble task.\r\nI take this opportunity also to express my thanks to\r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the distinguished\r\nmanner in which he has conducted the session just\r\nconcluded.\r\nI would also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his tireless efforts in reforming and\r\nrestructuring the Organization, and in improving its\r\nfunctioning and strengthening its role in all areas so that\r\nit can adapt to the requirements and challenges of the\r\nday. In this regard, we welcome the valuable report on\r\nthe work of the Organization that he presented at the\r\nbeginning of these proceedings.\r\nMauritania welcomes the Republic of Kiribati, the\r\nRepublic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga to the\r\nmembership of our Organization. We would like to\r\nexpress our readiness to work with them to achieve the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations.\r\nWe have to undertake immediately the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations and the restructuring of its organs in order\r\nto serve the world’s common interests. No one can deny\r\nthat the circumstances in which the Organization was\r\nfounded more than 50 years ago have changed a great\r\ndeal, and that important new changes have occurred in all\r\nareas since then. This only makes a re-examination of the\r\nstructures and working methods of the Organization more\r\nimperative. It is in this spirit that my delegation supports\r\nthe expansion of representation in the Security Council in\r\naccordance with the principles of democracy, transparency\r\nand equity in order to ensure equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation in that body, and to reflect the universal\r\nnature of our Organization, as laid down in the Charter.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nAs we meet at the threshold of the third millennium,\r\na large portion of humanity still lives in conditions that do\r\nnot enable people to satisfy their legitimate hopes and\r\naspirations to live in a world where peace, justice and well-\r\nbeing reign. In spite of some encouraging indicators in\r\ncertain developing countries, the general tendency is that of\r\na widening gap between developed and developing\r\ncountries. The latter are going through profound changes\r\nover which they have no control, affected by, among other\r\nthings, their debt burden, deterioration of commodity prices,\r\npoor access to international markets and weakness of\r\nforeign investment. This situation should alert the\r\nOrganization of the need not to limit its actions to the\r\ntraditional maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe situation calls for the Organization to strive to lighten\r\nthe heavy burden under which the developing countries\r\nlanguish in the economic and social fields. The United\r\nNations must also help these countries step up the pace of\r\ntheir economic growth. In this regard, donor countries\r\nshould increase their official development assistance,\r\nincrease their foreign investment and open up their markets\r\nto the products of developing countries in order to help\r\nbring about a new world order based on dialogue,\r\ncooperation and solidarity.\r\nIn this context, and since debt constitutes a burden that\r\nthe developing countries are incapable of bearing, it is\r\nimperative to give the question of debt the attention it\r\ndeserves. We express the hope that initiatives taken to help\r\nthe most heavily indebted poor countries will make it\r\npossible to eliminate the obstacles that are neutralizing and\r\nfrustrating their development efforts.\r\nToday the world faces many troublesome situations,\r\nthe consequences of which are felt beyond the frontiers of\r\nthe countries immediately involved. Such situations threaten\r\nsecurity, nationally, regionally and internationally, and call\r\ninto question the progress achieved towards economic and\r\nsocial development. We are required to find proper\r\nsolutions for such problems. By way of example, I would\r\nmention terrorism, human rights violations and poverty.\r\nIn this regard, my country reiterates its condemnation\r\nof terrorism, whatever its origin and form. It calls on the\r\ninternational community to strengthen cooperation and\r\ndialogue in order to combat this phenomenon with\r\ndetermination and firmness.\r\nLast year the General Assembly commemorated the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, which coincided with the fifth anniversary of the\r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights in Vienna. That was\r\nan opportunity to evaluate the results of the\r\nimplementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme\r\nof Action and the remaining obstacles in this area, and to\r\nidentify necessary measures for the full implementation of\r\nthe recommendations that the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights had adopted and that my country is\r\nstriving to translate into reality.\r\nWe should also mention the special session on\r\npopulation and development held by the General\r\nAssembly in this very Hall at the end of last June at\r\nwhich the Programme of Action of the Cairo International\r\nConference on Population and Development was\r\nreaffirmed. We hope that the results of that meeting will\r\nhelp improve the standard of living of all peoples and will\r\nhelp bring about sustainable development thanks to the\r\nstrengthening of the correlation between questions of\r\npopulation and those of development. In this area, I\r\nwould like to point out that my country has stepped up its\r\nefforts to promote the status of women and to combat\r\nilliteracy in all its forms, and it has produced programmes\r\nwith beneficial effects for the family, for children in\r\nparticular and for society in general.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania has adopted a\r\nforeign policy based on immutable principles of\r\npromoting good-neighbourly relations, peaceful\r\ncoexistence and the enhancement of regional and\r\ninternational cooperation. On the basis of these principles,\r\nmy country attaches particular importance to\r\nstrengthening stability and to containing the numerous\r\nsources of tension throughout the world, which are likely\r\nto jeopardize international peace and security and\r\ncompromise the development efforts of nations.\r\nWhile reaffirming its whole-hearted support for the\r\npeace process, my country believes that no just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace can be brought about in\r\nthe Middle East without the application of the principle of\r\nland for peace as agreed at the Madrid Conference, and\r\nthe comprehensive implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), which\r\nguarantee Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories, as well as from the Syrian Golan Heights,\r\nsouthern Lebanon and West Bekaa, and the restoration to\r\nthe Palestinian people of all their legitimate rights, first\r\nand foremost their right to self-determination and to the\r\ncreation of their independent State with Jerusalem as its\r\ncapital.\r\nToday, as we embark on a new era, the international\r\ncommunity is looking forward to reviving the peace\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nprocess and to restoring it to its proper track. In this regard,\r\nwe believe that a resumption of negotiations on all tracks\r\nbetween all parties concerned is a most urgent measure. We\r\ntherefore invite the two sponsors of the peace process to\r\nshoulder their responsibilities and to exert greater efforts to\r\npreserve the opportunity of a comprehensive, just and\r\nlasting peace in this region.\r\nIn the Gulf region, we hope to see a combination of\r\nregional and international efforts that would restore stability\r\nand concord to the region. In this regard, my country\r\nreaffirms its commitment to and respect for international\r\nlegality and the resolutions of the United Nations, and\r\nrepeats its rejection of anything that may be prejudicial to\r\nthe independence and the territorial integrity of Kuwait.\r\nWe also reaffirm our repudiation of any measure\r\nlikely to threaten the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.\r\nWe call for lifting the embargo that for eight years now has\r\nbeen inflicted on the Iraqi people, who have suffered\r\nenormously, especially children, women and the elderly.\r\nIn the Maghreb region, my country is working\r\ntogether with its brothers in the Arab Maghreb Union to\r\nestablish cooperation and dialogue in order to fulfil the\r\naspirations of the peoples of the region.\r\nAs regards the Western Sahara, my country welcomes\r\nthe positive steps taken towards the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations plan to resolve the dispute. We reaffirm our\r\nreadiness to do everything in our power to promote the\r\nimplementation of this plan.\r\nWith regard to the Lockerbie incident, my country\r\nwelcomes the efforts undertaken to achieve a final\r\nsettlement of this question, including the suspension of the\r\nsanctions imposed against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nAlthough we are pleased by the success of certain\r\ndiplomatic démarches, we nevertheless feel that it is time\r\nfor the Security Council to take the necessary steps to lift\r\nthis embargo once and for all.\r\nAs regards Guinea-Bissau, my country welcomes the\r\nsettlement that was achieved within the framework of the\r\nAbuja and Lomé Agreements, and we support the\r\ntransitional Government. In particular, we support the\r\nimplementation of commitments entered into at the Geneva\r\nround table and aimed at organizing pluralistic elections and\r\nat the reconstruction of the country.\r\nFurthermore, while expressing our profound concern\r\nabout the persistence of conflict in Somalia, we hope that\r\nour Somali brothers will engage in constructive dialogue\r\nand in a spirit of responsibility and patriotism so that a\r\npeaceful settlement can be reached and Somalia will again\r\nbe united and will regain its national sovereignty in an\r\natmosphere of stability and concord.\r\nMy country also welcomes the Peace Agreement\r\nreached between the legitimate Government of Sierra\r\nLeone and the Revolutionary United Front, and fervently\r\ncalls for stability and reconciliation in that country, which\r\nsuffered tremendously during eight years of devastating\r\nwar.\r\nMy country also notes with satisfaction the gradual\r\nreturn of peace to the Republic of the Congo and urges\r\nour Congolese brothers to continue their negotiations,\r\nwith a view to bringing about a peaceful settlement of\r\ntheir dispute so that that fraternal country can once again\r\nlive in peace and harmony.\r\nAs regards the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nwe welcome the diplomatic efforts of the fraternal\r\ncountries of the region, in particular South Africa and\r\nZambia, as well as the important role played by the leader\r\nof the Libyan revolution, Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi,\r\nin containing the crisis. In this regard, we welcome the\r\nsigning of the Lusaka Agreement.\r\nAs to Angola, my country expresses its profound\r\nregret at the resumption of fighting between the\r\nGovernment forces and the UNITA movement. In this\r\nregard, we reaffirm our wholehearted support for Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997) and 1173\r\n(1998) and urge UNITA to respect the obligations it\r\nentered into under the Lusaka Protocol to restore peace\r\nand security.\r\nOn the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, we\r\nurge the two parties to respect the ceasefire and to try to\r\nfind a peaceful settlement, on the basis of the plan of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity. In this context, we place\r\ngreat hope in the good-offices mission of Mr. Abdelaziz\r\nBouteflika, current Chairman of the OAU, to bring about\r\na peaceful and equitable settlement of the conflict.\r\nOn Kosovo, my country notes with satisfaction the\r\nprogress achieved in putting an end to the violence,\r\nrestoring confidence and reconstructing what was\r\ndestroyed over the long period of war.\r\nThe United Nations was created in order to achieve\r\nobjectives shared by all humanity: the maintenance of\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\npeace, security and stability throughout the world. The letter\r\nand the spirit of the Charter of our Organization provide for\r\na just balance between the rights and obligations of all and\r\naim at achieving these common interests of the international\r\ncommunity. Therefore, today, as we are about to enter the\r\nthird millennium, we are duty-bound to devote our efforts\r\nto honouring the commitments laid down in the Charter and\r\nto work together to build a new world order based on\r\njustice and directed towards preserving international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Marketing of\r\nDominica, His Excellency The Honourable Norris Charles.\r\nMr. Charles (Dominica): I am honoured to be\r\nafforded this opportunity to extend my delegation’s\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Gurirab and his country, Namibia, on\r\nhis election to the high office of President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session. His considerable\r\ndiplomatic experience is well known, and there is little\r\ndoubt that the affairs of this session will be conducted with\r\nexpeditiousness, skill and competence. At the same time, I\r\nwish to express my delegation’s appreciation and gratitude\r\nto his immediate predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the\r\nable manner in which he presided over the fifty-third\r\nsession.\r\nLet me extend my delegation’s thanks to our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the excellent and\r\nexemplary leadership qualities he has displayed during this\r\ncritical period for the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity. The Commonwealth of Dominica welcomes\r\nand congratulates the three new Member States — Kiribati,\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga — on their admission to\r\nthe United Nations. We pledge to work with them on\r\nmatters of mutual interest.\r\nI take this opportunity to convey my country’s deepest\r\ncondolences to the Governments and the people of the\r\nBahamas and the United States for the loss of life and\r\ndestruction of property caused by hurricane Floyd. I also\r\nexpress my Government’s sentiments regarding the victims\r\nof the earthquakes in Greece, the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan, Turkey, and, just recently, Mexico. Our sympathy\r\nis also extended to the victims of the nuclear accident in\r\nJapan.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is supportive of the\r\nongoing United Nations reform programme, the intent of\r\nwhich is to create a system geared to eliminating waste and\r\nduplication and making more efficient use of the\r\nOrganization’s resources. At its creation the United\r\nNations was charged with responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and the\r\nnumerous United Nations missions currently in place\r\naround the globe are testimony to the Organization’s\r\nefforts to meet its Charter obligations in this regard.\r\nHowever, we continue to maintain that the restructuring\r\nand revitalization process should result in creating an\r\nOrganization with the capacity, compassion and\r\neffectiveness to meet the many serious economic, social\r\nand humanitarian problems confronting the majority of\r\ncitizens in the global village.\r\nWe are not unmindful of the great contributions that\r\nthe United Nations system has made to the improvement\r\nof health, the eradication of diseases and the rising levels\r\nof education and living standards in various parts of the\r\nworld. Additionally, the United Nations has been at the\r\nforefront of efforts to focus international consciousness on\r\nhuman rights abuses, while it continues to be the last\r\nhope for the many thousands displaced each year as a\r\nresult of political, religious or ethnic conflict.\r\nBut poverty eradication remains an unfulfilled\r\npromise. Today, increasing numbers of people live in\r\nconditions of poverty, with no access to adequate medical\r\ncare, basic education or even clean drinking water. We\r\nrecognize that poverty eradication is a task to be\r\nundertaken not by the United Nations system alone, but\r\nin partnership with the international community, which\r\nmust come to the realization that improvement in social\r\nand economic conditions is less costly than having to deal\r\nwith the consequences of sustained economic deprivation\r\nand social degradation. The time for engaging in that\r\npartnership is now.\r\nAs for the reform of the Security Council, the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica supports the work of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group and its efforts at reconciling\r\nthe many outstanding issues and differences among\r\nMember States. We believe that any meaningful reform\r\nof the Security Council should reflect present-day\r\neconomic and geographical realities and must provide for\r\na reasonable expansion of its membership and equitable\r\nrepresentation for regional groupings, with no\r\ndifferentiation regarding the rights of permanent members.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica applauded the\r\ndecision of the people of East Timor, as expressed in the\r\npopular consultation of 30 August 1999. We must\r\ntherefore deplore and condemn the acts of violence visited\r\nupon the people of East Timor by those determined to\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nnullify the results of the consultation and maintain the\r\ncolonial status quo. We commend the United Nations for its\r\nwork in making the consultation possible and we strongly\r\nsupport the decision of the Security Council to authorize the\r\nestablishment of a multinational peacekeeping force to\r\nprotect the people of East Timor as they seek to assert their\r\nright to self-determination.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to address\r\nonce again the issue of legitimate representation for the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan and its people in the United\r\nNations. The Republic of China on Taiwan, a model of\r\ndemocracy in the Asian region, is able and willing to carry\r\nout the obligations contained in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Over the past few decades, the Republic of China\r\nhas made tremendous strides in economic development,\r\nthus enabling it to make a contribution to poverty\r\nalleviation through economic assistance programmes in\r\ndeveloping countries. Dominica is concerned that an\r\nindustrialized country, with a democratically elected\r\nGovernment, that exercises sovereign authority over a\r\ndefined geographical area with a population of 22 million\r\npeople, is denied membership of the United Nations. This\r\nsituation must be addressed in order to ensure that the\r\ncitizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan have a\r\nrepresentative voice in the United Nations and its related\r\nagencies.\r\nThe recently concluded special session of the General\r\nAssembly on small island developing States provided an\r\nopportunity to review the 1994 Barbados Plan of Action.\r\nThe recognition of small island developing States in that\r\nregard is a significant milestone in the history of the United\r\nNations. The follow-up action and the importance which the\r\ninternational community places on the implementation of\r\nthe many proposals and recommendations will serve to\r\ndetermine not only the success of the special session, but\r\nalso the credibility of the United Nations and the usefulness\r\nof these conferences.\r\nAs a small island developing State which has always\r\nrecognized the importance of conservation of the\r\nenvironment, Dominica made a commitment at the Rio\r\nSummit to vigorously pursue sustainable development. Two\r\nyears later, Dominica participated in the Global Conference\r\non the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates in Barbados and has tried at the national level to\r\nimplement the Plan of Action within the limits of our\r\nresources.\r\nThe Barbados Plan of Action recognizes the\r\nimportance of coastal and marine resources to the\r\nsustainable development of small island developing States.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is acutely aware of that\r\nimportance. Prudent use of our coastal and marine\r\nresources over many years has contributed immensely to\r\nthe economic well-being and sustenance of our citizens.\r\nMoreover, the successful implementation of our\r\neco-tourism development programme relies heavily on the\r\nmaintenance and preservation of the marine and biological\r\nresources present in the seas around our island State.\r\nThose resources are under constant and serious threat\r\nfrom a number of sources, such as illegal waste-dumping\r\nwith impunity by foreign-owned ocean liners; overfishing\r\nby non-indigenous fishing fleets; and the use of the\r\nCaribbean Sea for the transshipment of nuclear waste and\r\nother hazardous substances.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica, together with\r\nother members of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM), continues to view the dangerous practice of\r\nthe transshipment of nuclear waste and hazardous\r\nsubstances through the Caribbean Sea as a potentially\r\nserious threat to the fragile ecosystem and to the\r\nlivelihood and well-being of the people of the region, and\r\nwe call upon the States engaging in that practice to\r\ndemonstrate some regard for our justifiable concerns. We\r\nearnestly seek the support of the international community\r\nin our ongoing effort to halt the shipment of these\r\ndangerous materials through the Caribbean Sea. Further,\r\nmembers of CARICOM call upon the General Assembly\r\nto recognize the Caribbean Sea as a special area in the\r\ncontext of sustainable development and urge the\r\ninternational community to support the concept and its\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is appreciative of\r\nthe United Nations for paying special attention to the\r\nissue of small island developing States at the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly. One sincerely hopes\r\nthat this same recognition and support will be in evidence\r\nduring the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial\r\nConference later this year, when small island developing\r\nStates seek to address their particular concerns and\r\ncircumstances.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica, like most small\r\nvulnerable States, faces increasing challenges from\r\nglobalization; particularly in the area of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations. Due to resource constraints, developing\r\ncountries are having difficulties in meeting the\r\ncommitments which they made at the Uruguay Round.\r\nYet we are on the eve of making further commitments at\r\nthe new round of WTO negotiations to be launched in\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nSeattle in December. The negotiating process itself exposes\r\ndeveloping countries to the growing disparities of the\r\nmultilateral trading system. We run the risk of developing\r\ncountries being further marginalized unless these\r\nnegotiations give full recognition to their special\r\ncircumstances, and in particular to those of small vulnerable\r\neconomies. Small vulnerable economies will continue to\r\nrequire differential treatment for some time as a means of\r\nfacilitating their integration into the world economy.\r\nMy country’s experience with the WTO has not been\r\na positive one. The economy of Dominica and those of the\r\nother Caribbean banana-producing countries are heavily\r\ndependent for their export earnings on this single crop. The\r\nWTO banana ruling has contributed to a significant decline\r\nin our banana exports. Our bananas are cultivated by small\r\nfarmers whose main source of income could be wiped out\r\nas a result of the WTO ruling, resulting in increased\r\nunemployment and poverty in the rural areas.\r\nWe need to find a solution to the banana dispute that\r\nwill allow our farmers to continue to earn a living. There\r\nis a growing recognition of the need for a tariff rate quota\r\nas the most acceptable solution. However, the North\r\nAmerican multinational banana companies are insisting on\r\na simple tariff, which will ultimately lead to the demise of\r\nthe small banana producers in the Caribbean and other\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific States. We continue to\r\nreceive assurances that it is not the intention of our\r\nneighbours to the North to hurt the Caribbean producers,\r\nbut their actions indicate otherwise. Moreover, they insist\r\non applying a strict interpretation to the multilateral trading\r\nrules, which displays a callous disregard of the plight of\r\nsmall banana farmers. The rules of the WTO must not be\r\napplied in a manner which is detrimental to the\r\ndevelopment process of small vulnerable States.\r\nMy focus on issues presently facing the region would\r\nbe incomplete without a brief but sincere appeal to this\r\nbody to address the plight of the citizens of our sister island\r\nCuba. As we progress to a new century, the United Nations\r\nmust continue to condemn the prolonged economic\r\nblockade of Cuba.\r\nThis unjustifiable action is unconscionable,\r\nunreasonable and a direct infringement on the rights of the\r\npeople of Cuba to pursue a peaceful existence, economic\r\nprosperity and self-determination. Dominica therefore joins\r\nother members of the international community in calling for\r\nan end to this blockade. We should all seek more amicable\r\nmethods of settling bilateral disputes.\r\nAs a nation preparing to celebrate its twenty-first\r\nanniversary of independence on 3 November 1999,\r\nDominica will continue to equip itself and its citizens to\r\nmeet the challenges of the global environment and the\r\nnew millennium. The Government of the Commonwealth\r\nof Dominica has endeavoured to ensure that its policies\r\nand programmes continue to provide the leadership,\r\ninstitutions and infrastructure necessary to attain that goal.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nStrengthened by our rich cultural heritage, as\r\nmanifested in our Creole music, dance and other forms of\r\nexpression, we are convinced that the world would be a\r\nsafer and better place if the people of the world learned\r\nto respect and tolerate each other’s culture, religion and\r\ntraditions.\r\nIt is in this spirit that Dominica reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the ideals of the United Nations and\r\npledges to do all in its power to support the efforts of all\r\nStates, particularly those of the vulnerable small island\r\ndeveloping States. The challenges facing Dominica are\r\nmany, but I am confident that with the support of all\r\nMember States and with the help of God we shall prevail.\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ethiopia, His Excellency Mr. Seyoum Mesfin.\r\nMr. Mesfin (Ethiopia): On behalf of my delegation\r\nand on my own behalf, it is with great satisfaction that I\r\nwish to extend to you, Sir, our congratulations on your\r\nwell-deserved election to preside over the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session, which is coinciding\r\nwith the end of a momentous century. It is indeed a\r\nsource of immense pleasure and pride to my delegation\r\nand myself to see you presiding over this forum where\r\nyou, as the representative here of the South West Africa\r\nPeople’s Organization for many years, waged an\r\nunrelenting struggle for the independence of your country,\r\nNamibia, which was crowned with success in 1990. Your\r\nassumption of this high office is a fitting tribute to the\r\nstruggle of the many sons and daughters of Africa over\r\nthe years for the total emancipation of Africa from\r\ncolonial rule. I wish to assure you of the fullest\r\ncooperation of my delegation in the discharge of the\r\nheavy responsibilities entrusted to you. I wish also to\r\nseize this opportunity to convey to your predecessor, Mr.\r\nDidier Opertti, our appreciation for a job well done, and\r\nwe salute him for all the efforts he has made.\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nI should also like to welcome the new Members of our\r\nOrganization: the Republic of Nauru, the Kingdom of\r\nTonga and the Republic of Kiribati.\r\nTo our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for whom\r\nmy country has great esteem, I wish to renew our\r\nfriendship and to reiterate how much we have always\r\nappreciated his wisdom and his vision. His being at the\r\nhelm of the world body is indeed one of the few\r\nconsolations for Africa, a continent which otherwise has\r\nlittle voice within the Organization.\r\nThis annual occasion, here at this forum, affords us a\r\nunique opportunity to express our views as Member States\r\non issues that are of concern to us as members of the\r\nhuman family, as part of specific regions of the world and\r\nin our capacity as nations. The 170 items on the\r\nAssembly’s agenda at this session are clear testimony to the\r\nrange of issues confronting the international community as\r\nwe approach the coming millennium. It is not, however,\r\nalways easy to separate these various levels of concern.\r\nThey are obviously interconnected, and all the more so for\r\ncountries such as Ethiopia, whose fates are affected,\r\npositively or negatively, by what takes place internationally\r\nand by what the United Nations does and does not do.\r\nIt goes without saying that developing countries in\r\ngeneral, and the least developed countries in particular, as\r\na group, face the most serious problems in all areas of\r\ninternational life. Problems of poverty, underdevelopment\r\nand the debt burden are among the multifarious problems\r\nthe developing countries are grappling with today. As a\r\nleast developed country, Ethiopia has its own share of these\r\nproblems, the magnitude of which is all too obvious, even\r\nas we are making a determined effort to overcome them.\r\nIn this statement I will not try to go into all the\r\nproblems facing developing countries today. Instead, I\r\nshould like to focus on one issue: collective security,\r\nespecially in relation to its impact on developing countries,\r\nthose in Africa in particular, and how the United Nations\r\nhas failed them in this critical area. For Ethiopia this is all\r\nthe more justified and timely inasmuch as we have been the\r\nvictim of aggression — not for the first time in our\r\nhistory — for over a year now.\r\nThe United Nations has been important to us, and the\r\npromise contained in its Charter to be our collective\r\ninstrument for international peace and security and a vehicle\r\nfor international cooperation in all areas of human\r\nendeavour has been a source of hope. But we in Ethiopia\r\nare not so sure that the hope we have is always justified,\r\nboth as Africans and as Ethiopians.\r\nFrom the vantage point of Africa, it is indeed\r\ndifficult to assert with confidence that the Organization is\r\nalso ours. This must also apply to the rest of the\r\ndeveloping world. But the African case is unique.\r\nWhether it is in the area of economic cooperation or with\r\nrespect to peace and security, our continent continues to\r\nbe a region of the world which is the least favoured for\r\neffective and meaningful cooperation. The “We the\r\npeoples of the United Nations” mentioned in the Preamble\r\nto the Charter and the lofty aspirations contained therein\r\ncontinue to be distant dreams for Africa.\r\nThis might be regarded by some as an exaggerated\r\nclaim and an attempt to shift the blame for a predicament\r\nwhich is of Africa’s own making and therefore a harsh\r\njudgment on the performance of the United Nations. We\r\nin Ethiopia would be the first to acknowledge the critical\r\nvalue for us of the very many types of cooperation we\r\nhave with the United Nations and its various agencies,\r\nsome of which have indeed been very effective. It would\r\nbe unfair to the Organization and to many of its dedicated\r\nstaff for us to fail to acknowledge this.\r\nIn this regard, a balanced evaluation of the\r\nperformance of the United Nations cannot fail to take\r\nnote of the good work being done by the Organization in\r\nthe economic, social and humanitarian areas. This is apart\r\nfrom the indispensable role that the United Nations and\r\nits various agencies, most particularly its specialized\r\nagencies, play in harmonizing the activities of nations in\r\nvarious critical spheres.\r\nIt is also true that Africa and, in particular, some of\r\nits individual countries, appear to have a unique way of\r\nensuring that available opportunities are missed for\r\nmaking progress for peace and development. But still the\r\nAfrican condition can hardly be explained only in terms\r\nof omission or commission by the people of the continent.\r\nIt would suffice to refer to the cold war and to the\r\nsuper-Power rivalry spawned by that episode and to the\r\nhavoc wrought by it in Africa to be reminded that\r\nAfrica’s pains are not always of its own making.\r\nWhatever the causes for Africa’s predicament,\r\nhowever, the spirit of common destiny, interdependence\r\nand the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations should\r\nhave obliged the international community to be more\r\nforthcoming in rendering effective cooperation to regions\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nsuch as Africa so that they can overcome the obstacles to\r\ndevelopment faced by their peoples.\r\nThe fact that there is no international cooperation at\r\npresent in the spirit of the United Nations Charter is\r\nnowhere more evident than in the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the debt burden, which continues to remain the\r\nmost critical factor hindering development and the\r\nalleviation of poverty. There have so far been no effective\r\nsteps taken internationally to alleviate this scourge, and\r\nthere is no visible remedy on the horizon. This is a telling\r\ntestimony to how much the promise contained in the\r\nCharter about international cooperation has remained an\r\nempty slogan. If our vision for the United Nations for the\r\ncentury we are entering does not incorporate a remedy to\r\nthis danger, then for the bulk of humanity the Organization\r\nis bound to be more irrelevant than it is today.\r\nIt is not only that the United Nations is about to enter\r\nthe next century with little to show in bringing about\r\ngenuine international cooperation for combating poverty.\r\nEven more worrying is that it is going to do so with its\r\ncredibility very much in tatters with regard to its collective\r\nsecurity system, which at present commands little trust as\r\na collective instrument of the international community for\r\nworld peace and security.\r\nWhether during the cold war or since it, in this area\r\nthe United Nations, more often than not, has remained a\r\ncustodian not of the collective security interests of the\r\npeople of the world, but of the special security interests of\r\nthose who count. Here is where double standards abound,\r\neven with respect to the defense of some sacrosanct\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nAfrica can hardly be proud of the way it has handled\r\neven the very little opportunity it has had for establishing\r\ndurable peace and security in the continent. Even after\r\nhaving granted that the difficult socio-economic conditions\r\nof the region have been the major causes for the African\r\ndilemma in this area, the fact still remains that bad\r\ngovernance, mismanagement of resources, lack of tolerance\r\nfor diversity and human rights violations have indeed\r\nfuelled some of the conflicts in our continent. Therefore we\r\ncannot absolve ourselves fully from taking part of the\r\nblame. In the final analysis, we have to find our own\r\nsolution to these problems.\r\nBut, on the other hand, the fact remains that Africa\r\nhas received little effective international cooperation, in\r\nparticular from the United Nations, for sorting out its\r\ndifficulties in the area of peace and security. Conflicts in\r\nAfrica have had the fate of either being neglected or,\r\nwhen not neglected, being judged and handled by\r\ndifferent standards. Let me give a couple of illustrations.\r\nThe genocide in Rwanda is a source of shame for\r\nAfrica, but it was also a reminder of the double standards\r\nto which Africa has been subjected. The fact that Somalia\r\nand its people have been left to their own devices,\r\nregardless of the consequences for the people of Somalia\r\nand for the peace and stability of their neighbours, is yet\r\nanother indication of the types of conflicts which elicit, or\r\nfail to elicit, the serious concern of those who count for\r\ngalvanizing the efforts of the United Nations for action to\r\ndischarge its responsibilities for collective security. Why\r\nshould it matter to those who set the agenda for what the\r\nSecurity Council does if the chaos in Somalia becomes a\r\nbreeding ground for terrorism, as long as the threat is\r\nlimited only to those who have little voice in the Security\r\nCouncil?\r\nThe conflict in Somalia is indeed complex, but it is\r\nno more complex than other conflicts in other parts of the\r\nworld. Somalia is in turmoil and has been for the last\r\nnine years, not because the crisis is intractable, but\r\nbecause Somalia is neglected. That country has failed to\r\nbe on the top of the United Nations agenda, not because\r\nit has no legitimate claim to be a priority for the United\r\nNations collective security system, but because the\r\ninterests of those who count are not affected. This also\r\napplies more or less to Angola and Sierra Leone, and\r\nearlier to Liberia.\r\nIn short, the United Nations has failed Africa, and\r\nnow stands, one foot into the next century, with this\r\nrecord. In connection with Somalia, I should like to state\r\nthat Ethiopia, the country mandated by the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) to follow up and assist in\r\nresolving the crisis in Somalia, fully supports the\r\ninitiatives expounded by Mr. Ismail Omar Guelleh,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Djibouti from this rostrum\r\nlast week in his capacity as current Chairman of the Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\r\nThe experience of my own country over the last year\r\nand a half and more speaks volumes about how the\r\nUnited Nations can fail an African country deemed to\r\nhave no option other than submit to unjust decisions by\r\nthe powerful. In effect, what the United Nations said to\r\nEthiopia was that Article 51 of the Charter, which\r\nprovides for the inherent right of sovereign nations to\r\nself-defence, did not apply to poor nations such as\r\nEthiopia. That has been our experience in our attempts to\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nensure the peaceful resolution of the Ethiopian-Eritrean\r\ncrisis caused by the unprovoked Eritrean aggression against\r\nus.\r\nUntil May 1998, Ethiopia was nurturing the peace that\r\nit had finally achieved after decades of turmoil. The\r\nEritrean problem — one of the sources of instability for\r\nEthiopia — was settled, with Ethiopia leading the way in\r\nrecognizing the new nation of Eritrea. Ethiopia became a\r\nbulwark of peace in our subregion — a fact which was\r\nrecognized by many. By demobilizing half a million troops\r\nand allocating the barest minimum from its budget — less\r\nthan 2 per cent of its gross domestic product — to defence,\r\nthe country was making it clear in its actions that poor\r\nnations have time to wage war only against their principal\r\nenemy, poverty — poverty and backwardness.\r\nThe new orientation of the country did produce\r\ndividends, most of all in terms of economic growth:\r\naverage GDP growth of over 7 per cent per year was\r\nachieved, after a difficult period of transition. But then,\r\ntragedy struck and we fell victim to Eritrean aggression.\r\nThe unprovoked aggression against us by Eritrea in May\r\n1998 taught us the lesson that peace is not always achieved\r\nby the unilateral decision of nations so long as there are\r\nrogue States that worship the gun and with leaders who\r\nhave no domestic limitations on the power they exercise or\r\non the decisions they make.\r\nEritrea has become a source of tragedy not only for\r\nEthiopia but also for its own people and for the countries\r\nof the subregion. No sooner had it achieved formal\r\nindependence, in 1993, than it provoked a fight with the\r\nSudan, to be followed by an unprovoked onslaught on\r\nYemen in November 1995. Continuing the same pattern of\r\nlawlessness, in 1996 Eritrea again went ahead and claimed,\r\nby use of force, part of Djibouti’s territory — a reckless\r\nattempt which was defused in time, thanks also to efforts\r\nby Ethiopia.\r\nThe Eritrean aggression against Ethiopia in May 1998\r\nwas therefore part of the same vivid pattern of behaviour as\r\nbefore, behaviour which has now made the country a major\r\nsource of instability for our subregion, particularly in\r\nSomalia, where Eritrea’s destructive activities have caused\r\neven more havoc in a nation with no functioning State at\r\nall. Thus, consistent with its ignoble motive of exploiting\r\nthe anarchy and lawlessness in Somalia to advance its\r\nirresponsible policy of destabilizing the countries in the\r\nHorn of Africa, Eritrea is actively collaborating with the\r\nwarlords in Somalia by arming and training them and\r\nfinancing their fratricidal conflict, thereby exacerbating the\r\nalready volatile and unclear state of affairs in the country\r\nwith all the attendant adverse consequences for peace and\r\nstability in our subregion.\r\nEver since the onset of the Eritrean aggression\r\nagainst Ethiopia, people have been asking how one of the\r\nyoungest and poorest nations on earth, whose people have\r\nbarely emerged from the trauma of a protracted liberation\r\nstruggle, can have the capacity to embark upon one of the\r\nmost destructive campaigns of destabilization the entire\r\nHorn of Africa subregion — or even the whole of Africa\r\nfor that matter — has ever seen. Over and above the\r\nquestion of Eritrea’s capacity, people have been\r\nwondering what the motive can be that is driving such\r\nacts on the part of a new Member of the family of\r\nnations, acts with serious implications for peace and\r\nsecurity in our region.\r\nThe answer to these questions is not difficult to find.\r\nTo be a destructive force among nations does not require\r\nany special capacity or resources. Small States can create\r\nhavoc and make life difficult for the international\r\ncommunity just as large States can. In fact, an extremist\r\ngroup on the fringes of international life, with no\r\nelaborate organizational structure, can without much effort\r\nsucceed in destabilizing an entire region let alone a\r\nvulnerable subregion like ours. In effect, it does not seem\r\nas if it requires any special capacity to be a rogue State.\r\nRogue States as such are not born, they become so of\r\ntheir own volition.\r\nThat is what we see in Eritrea today: the Eritrean\r\nGovernment is now working hand in glove not only with\r\ndisgruntled groups in our subregion but also with\r\ninternational terrorists, training, financing and giving them\r\nall-round support in their ultimate objective of\r\ndestabilizing the States of the subregion. We do not\r\nbelieve the source of this Eritrean behaviour is external.\r\nIt is internal: it emanates from the nature of the domestic\r\npolitical structure in that country. If the domestic political\r\nprocess in a country has no constraining factors to speak\r\nof on its leadership, this, sooner or later, is bound to have\r\na negative impact on the peace and security of the States\r\nof that subregion.\r\nIn Eritrea this phenomenon is clearly visible today.\r\nA total absence of domestic institutions necessary for a\r\nnormal State; the lack of accountability on the part of the\r\nleadership; the non-existence of even a semblance of\r\nchecks and balances — in effect the absence of a\r\nconstitutional order — are the distinguishing features of\r\nEritrea today. Pluralism; freedom of association and\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nexpression; the right to express dissent — are unknown in\r\nEritrea. Democratic elections are, of course, unheard of\r\nthere. In fact, Eritrea has nothing to do with the\r\ninternational community in terms of observance of\r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms and good\r\ngovernance since it is, for all practical purposes, ruled by\r\nthe whims of one man. The net effect of these domestic\r\npolitical characteristics and their impact on peace and\r\nsecurity in our subregion is that more than any other people\r\nit is, in the final analysis, the Eritrean people that are\r\nsuffering most, bearing the brunt of the hardship resulting\r\nfrom their Government’s destabilizing policies and activities\r\nin the Horn of Africa.\r\nNo one who has closely followed this tragedy visited\r\non Ethiopia by the Eritrean leadership can be unaware of\r\nhow much effort Ethiopia has made, for over nine months,\r\nto ensure the reversal of the Eritrean aggression through\r\npeaceful means. But it was to no avail. And, most\r\nregrettably, the United Nations failed us. In contrast, I\r\nshould like to express my Government’s admiration and\r\ngratitude for the commendable stand taken by OAU and\r\nAfrica throughout the crisis in defence of the principles on\r\nwhich this Organization was founded.\r\nHowever, despite the efforts of the OAU, Eritrea did\r\nnot listen. The United Nations pretended, even though it\r\nknew better, that there had been no aggression. The\r\nSecurity Council went even further, as did some in the\r\ninternational community, in a coordinated effort to punish\r\nthe victim of aggression, without so much as a word about\r\nthe aggression or about the gross violations of international\r\nlaw committed by a country known to have developed the\r\nhabit of acting in a lawless manner.\r\nThe members of the Security Council knew full well\r\nright from the outset that Eritrea had committed a naked\r\nand unprovoked act of aggression against Ethiopia. Yet they\r\nchose to characterize a blatant violation of a fundamental\r\nprinciple of international law as a mere border dispute.\r\nThis, to say the least, is an evasion of the primary\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. It clearly signified a\r\nfailure on the part of the Council to uphold the most\r\nhallowed principle of international law, namely, the\r\nprohibition of the use of force in international relations,\r\nexcept in self-defence. It is a negation of the very concept\r\nof collective security in which all States, big and small,\r\nplaced their confidence when they subscribed to the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAs if to underscore its failure to uphold the\r\ninternational rule of law, the Security Council, in its very\r\nfirst resolution on the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict, adopted\r\non 26 June 1998, demanded an immediate ceasefire, in\r\neffect rewarding aggression. What better demonstration\r\ncould there be of the Council’s failure to take a\r\ndetermined stand against aggression by demanding that it\r\nbe reversed before calling for a ceasefire? What better\r\nincentive could there be for aggressors like Eritrea to\r\ncontinue with their aggression and reap even more fruits\r\nfrom their wanton acts?\r\nEven more disheartening and gratuitous was the\r\nstatement issued on 23 June 1999 by the Security Council\r\nreminding us of “our primary responsibility to feed our\r\npeoples”, as if poor nations did not have the right to\r\ndefend their sovereignty. Or was it meant to imply that\r\nthe very notion of sovereignty is of no consequence at all\r\nfor a poor country like Ethiopia? That, history will recall,\r\nwas what the League of Nations told us, if not in so\r\nmany words, more than 60 years ago. But this was not\r\nwhat we expected from the United Nations today.\r\nTo make matters worse, the Security Council chose,\r\non 10 February 1999, through resolution 1227 (1999), to\r\nurge States to end sales of arms both to the aggressor and\r\nto the victim, while at the same time continuing to\r\ndeliberate on how the peace proposal submitted by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, and already accepted by\r\nEthiopia, could be modified to make it acceptable to the\r\naggressor at the expense of the victim.\r\nThis was again the essence of the informal\r\ndeliberations by the Security Council on 24 February\r\n1999. The aggressor country was in effect told to wait\r\nuntil the victim of aggression gave in to pressure.\r\nThe refusal by a poor nation to accept insult, a\r\nnation which happened to be the victim of aggression,\r\nobviously entails certain consequences. The punishment\r\nmeted out has had almost no limits. It has included\r\nfinancial institutions changing the rules of the game in\r\nmidstream. In the case of Ethiopia, they saw fit to\r\nabrogate ongoing programmes based on non-technical\r\nconsiderations that had absolutely nothing to do with the\r\nresults of actual performance evaluations. That has been\r\nthe experience of Ethiopia with the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF), which suspended its cooperation\r\nwith Ethiopia on political grounds, although it knew full\r\nwell that it had absolutely no cause for that action on the\r\nbasis of the relevant criteria.\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nOnce the tone was set by the Security Council, others\r\nfound it easy to overlook the injustice involved and added\r\ntheir weight to a stance which made a mockery of\r\nelementary justice. The European Union and other\r\ninstitutions and countries jumped on the bandwagon,\r\nmaking it clear to Ethiopia that a poor nation is not entitled\r\nto defend itself and that not heeding this warning would\r\nhave its consequences. And it did. Ethiopia’s fault was one\r\nand only one, and that was its insistence that aggression\r\ncannot and must not be rewarded through the use of\r\nwhatever pretext, including calls for an unconditional\r\nceasefire, which was demanded by the aggressor and\r\nthought to be in accord with the interests of those who\r\ncount. The sovereign rights of the victim did not count.\r\nThat was the implication for our whole region of the\r\nlawless Eritrean philosophy of grabbing land first and then\r\ninviting the victims for talks.\r\nI should not, however, give the impression that\r\neverybody has been inconsiderate to my country in its hour\r\nof need. Indeed, there are countries and institutions that\r\nduly value partnership in development which stood by us,\r\nrealizing that discontinuing development assistance to the\r\nvictim of aggression would be tantamount to rewarding that\r\naggression. Those countries have not only continued their\r\nassistance but also, in some cases, increased it. On behalf\r\nof the people of Ethiopia, I should like to express our deep\r\ngratitude to those countries and institutions, whose\r\ndemonstration of solidarity we will always cherish.\r\nIn the light of this experience, it is indeed difficult to\r\nkeep intact our trust in the United Nations and in\r\ninternational cooperation. It is also difficult to have faith in\r\nthe efficacy of the United Nations collective security\r\nsystem.\r\nThe United Nations cannot avoid sharing the blame for\r\nthe bloodshed and destruction that followed the nine-month\r\nEritrean intransigence. The Ethiopian-Eritrean crisis\r\neventually led to major fighting, not only because the\r\naggressor was intransigent and refused to give peace a\r\nchance, but also because the United Nations failed to speak\r\nin defence of principles of international law.\r\nWith respect to the aggression against Ethiopia by\r\nEritrea, it is the justified feeling of the Ethiopian people\r\nthat the failure of the United Nations to stand up for its\r\nprinciples is indeed comparable to the injustice done to my\r\ncountry by the League of Nations in 1936.\r\nBut this episode has wider implications over and\r\nabove Ethiopia. It raises a fundamental question with regard\r\nto the ability of the United Nations to be a guardian of\r\nthe principles of international law — a guardianship\r\nwhich would have no financial implications when limited\r\nto a mere affirmation of principles. The United Nations\r\nhas shown us that it cannot even do this. Why this should\r\nbe so calls for a response, which, if given with candour,\r\nshould invite drastic measures so that we can have a\r\nUnited Nations which provides a home to all in equal\r\nmeasure.\r\nAs for Ethiopia’s commitment to peace, that cannot\r\nbe questioned, as has been made clear consistently since\r\nEritrea’s aggression. Ethiopia’s position has always been\r\nconsistent. Aggression, we have said, cannot be rewarded.\r\nPeace requires its reversal. That is what every nation\r\nwould have demanded if it had found itself in Ethiopia’s\r\nposition. Ethiopia has asked for nothing more.\r\nEritrea now says it is prepared to do what it could\r\nhave done a year and half ago — something that the\r\nUnited Nations never dared to ask it to do. While this in\r\nitself is Ethiopia’s vindication, experience has nonetheless\r\ntaught us a lesson: we must ensure that there are no\r\nloopholes in any agreement reached on the withdrawal of\r\nEritrean troops from Ethiopian territory occupied by\r\nforce. This is the nature of the ongoing dialogue we are\r\nnow engaged in with the OAU. There is absolutely no\r\nreason why it should be difficult to address the legitimate\r\nconcerns of the victim of aggression with regard to the\r\nclarity of the commitments undertaken by the aggressor\r\ncountry.\r\nIndeed, the principles involved should be protected\r\nin the interests not only of Ethiopia but also of our\r\nsubregion and beyond. The lawlessness and contempt for\r\nthe principles of international law demonstrated by\r\nEritrea, which have now poisoned the whole region, must\r\nbe contained. This can be done at the minimum by\r\nsending a clear message to its leadership that enough is\r\nenough and that aggression should not pay. This is all the\r\nmore necessary with respect to those who, in the absence\r\nof even a semblance of institutions of governance in the\r\ncountry, are above the law and have little accountability.\r\nThat is why we have insisted, and continue to insist, that\r\nEritrea must be allowed to gain nothing from its\r\nlawlessness. That is why we have insisted, and continue\r\nto insist — not without sacrifice — that there should be\r\nno loopholes in agreements concluded so that the\r\nprinciple that aggression should not be rewarded is\r\nunderlined clearly and with no ambiguity. We thus remain\r\nhopeful — hoping against hope — that Ethiopia’s\r\nconcerns will be addressed adequately, thereby making it\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\neasier to put behind us the nightmare created by the\r\nEritrean aggression.\r\nThe United Nations is at a crossroads. It cannot limp\r\nalong and enter the next century with all its weaknesses\r\nunattended. Reforms are necessary. The Security Council\r\ncannot remain as it is, unrepresentative and unresponsive to\r\nthe interests of the majority. It is still not too late to restore\r\nconfidence in the collective security system envisioned in\r\nthe Charter of our Organization more than half a century\r\nago. The credibility of the United Nations needs to be\r\nrevived. How can the United Nations command the trust of\r\nall Member States and their peoples? That is one of the\r\nquestions with which the United Nations will have to\r\ngrapple as we enter the twenty-first century.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Eritrea, His Excellency Mr. Haile\r\nWeldensae.\r\nMr. Weldensae (Eritrea): Allow me at the outset to\r\njoin with others who have spoken before me in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. I am certain\r\nthat your experience and skills, as well as your dedication\r\nto freedom and justice, make you qualified to lead the\r\nUnited Nations as it searches for peace in Africa and\r\nelsewhere in the coming year.\r\nI also take this opportunity to pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the effective manner in\r\nwhich he guided the work of the previous session. I extend\r\nmy gratitude to the Secretary-General for his dedicated and\r\nexemplary contributions to the cause of peace.\r\nPermit me also to welcome the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga as new\r\nMembers of our Organization.\r\nIt is a matter of deep concern that this year is\r\nwitnessing the continuation of conflicts and the emergence\r\nof new sources of conflict. In particular, it is disturbing to\r\nnote the growing tendency to resort to the use or threat of\r\nforce. This has become a grave danger to the independence\r\nand unity of States as well as to regional and international\r\npeace and security. This year has recorded some of the\r\nbloodiest inter-State and intra-State conflicts, in Africa,\r\nAsia and Europe.\r\nSub-Saharan African has been the part of the world\r\nthat has suffered most from those conflicts. Sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica’s economic performance and political stability have,\r\nin fact, taken a turn for the worse in 1999. About one\r\nthird of the 52 members of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), all of them in sub-Saharan Africa, have\r\nbeen worse off economically in 1999 than they were in\r\nthe previous year. Almost 20 countries have been afflicted\r\nby armed civil conflict or inter-State war. It is not\r\nsurprising that almost all of the countries that have\r\nsuffered economic relapse are the ones that are embroiled\r\nin conflict.\r\nAmong those 20, the worst are to be found in the\r\nHorn of Africa. More than two thirds of their people are\r\nliving in abject misery. Most have little or no food. They\r\nare ridden with disease. The economies of most of those\r\ncountries are in shambles. The region is politically\r\nunstable and racked by conflict. It is no surprise,\r\ntherefore, that some donor States and international\r\nfinancial institutions have rightly denounced the state of\r\naffairs and have informed a few of those States that they\r\nwould be better advised to feed their hungry millions and\r\nbetter manage their economies than squander countless\r\nmillions to finance ill-advised military adventures.\r\nIn his report on Africa, Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan made it amply clear that economic stagnation and\r\npoverty are a direct function of conflict. However, this is\r\nas evident elsewhere as it is in Africa. Thus, the situations\r\nin East Timor, Afghanistan, Kosovo or Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina are no different from those in the Horn of\r\nAfrica, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo or Angola. In all those cases, conflicts have caused\r\nserious setbacks in development plans and negatively\r\nimpacted on the living conditions of the people. In almost\r\nall cases, conflict has been the intrinsic cause of famine\r\nand serious violations of human rights and other\r\nhumanitarian crises. The international community cannot\r\nafford complacency in the face of such threats to\r\ninternational peace and security, if it is to be believed that\r\npeace is indivisible and that what happens in one region\r\nwill have an impact on others.\r\nVarious reasons, including ethnic and religious\r\nhatred, economic and political grievances and\r\nunemployment, have been advanced as the root causes of\r\nconflict. While these are valid factors, it must never be\r\nforgotten that territorial expansionism, both within and\r\noutside the State, and the determination to achieve it by\r\nthe use or threat of military force and by political and\r\neconomic coercion against the territorial integrity and\r\nindependence of neighbouring countries, has been the\r\nmajor cause of conflict and the disturbance of peace in\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nthe Horn of Africa. Eritrea, the victim of Ethiopia’s\r\nterritorial ambitions and its policy of aggression, is one\r\nexample of this.\r\nIt has now been 16 months since the eruption of the\r\nconflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the root cause of\r\nwhich is Ethiopia’s avowedly ethnic-based policy of\r\nterritorial aggrandizement and its systematic annexation of\r\nlarge areas of Eritrean territory. From the beginning of the\r\nconflict, Eritrea has consistently pursued a policy of\r\npeaceful resolution of the border problem even in the face\r\nof provocation, creeping annexation of its territory and\r\noutright aggression. To that end, it had attempted, before\r\nthe eruption of the conflict, to engage the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment in peaceful dialogue to amicably resolve all\r\nexisting problems and controversies related to their\r\ncommon border. Even after the start of the conflict, Eritrea\r\non several occasions requested the Ethiopian side to agree\r\nto accept bilateral negotiations. When this was rejected by\r\nEthiopia, Eritrea unilaterally issued a proposal which\r\ncontained detailed modalities for the peaceful resolution of\r\nthe conflict. That too was rejected by the Ethiopian regime.\r\nAfter the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was\r\nseized of the matter, Eritrea accepted, despite its grave\r\nreservations, the Framework Agreement submitted to both\r\nparties following the Ouagadougou summit of June 1998,\r\nafter it had received the clarifications it had sought on\r\nseveral critical issues. Eritrea also readily and unequivocally\r\naccepted, at the Algiers OAU summit in July 1999, the\r\nmodalities for the implementation of the Framework\r\nAgreement. The modalities were in fact drawn up to satisfy\r\nthe unjust, unfair and unwarranted new preconditions made\r\nby Ethiopia on the basis of its own unilateral interpretation\r\nof the Framework Agreement. Eritrea declared that it was\r\naccepting the modalities only in the interests of peace and\r\nof the good of both the Ethiopian and the Eritrean peoples.\r\nFinally, Eritrea also accepted without any delay the\r\ntechnical arrangements for the implementation of the\r\nFramework Agreement and modalities which were\r\nsubmitted to both parties on 23 August 1999.\r\nImplementation of the provisions of the Framework\r\nAgreement would entail, inter alia, the following: it would\r\nrequire a cessation of hostilities, the redeployment of the\r\ntroops of both sides from disputed territories and the\r\ndeployment of peacekeeping forces in those areas. Eritrea\r\nis fully committed to this. It would require investigation of\r\nthe sequence of events to determine the origins of the\r\nconflict. Eritrea welcomes this since it would conclusively\r\nidentify the real aggressor. The Framework Agreement\r\nenvisages the investigation of human rights abuses. Eritrea\r\nawaits the results eagerly. Implementation would\r\ndetermine the exact borders between the two countries.\r\nEritrea is enthusiastic about this. Eritrea is certain that the\r\ninternational community too is just as eager and\r\nenthusiastic about finding the final truth on all these and\r\nother related matters.\r\nOn the other hand, the Ethiopian Government was\r\ndetermined to achieve its territorial ambitions by all\r\nmeans, fair or foul. To this end, in 1997 and 1998,\r\nmembers of the armed forces and militia of the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment systematically used brute force to expel\r\nEritreans from Eritrean lands and to incorporate southern\r\nand south-eastern Eritrean territories into Ethiopia. That\r\nGovernment then rejected all Eritrean overtures on direct\r\npeace talks and continued feverishly to prepare for new\r\naggression even as it paid lip service to the Framework\r\nAgreement. On 6 February 1999, it launched an invasion\r\nalong several sectors of our common boundary, even\r\nwhile peace facilitators from the United Nations and the\r\nUnited States were engaged in shuttle diplomacy to bring\r\nthe conflict to an end. Sadly, tens of thousands of\r\nEthiopians and many Eritreans perished or were wounded\r\nduring that aggression.\r\nWhen Eritrea accepted the Framework Agreement,\r\nEthiopia came out with new preconditions based solely on\r\nits own interpretation of the Agreement, rather than\r\njoining Eritrea in the implementation of the peace plan.\r\nYet Ethiopia was to accept the modalities — which were\r\nactually formulated to satisfy its unfair, unjust and\r\nunwarranted demands — only after much prevarication\r\nand procrastination. Finally, Ethiopia issued a statement\r\non 4 September 1999 which was tantamount to a rejection\r\nof the technical arrangements, which are only a procedure\r\nfor implementing the Framework Agreement and the\r\nmodalities, on the untenable grounds that it contained\r\nelements which were not part of the previous two\r\ndocuments. One week later, on the eve of the Ethiopian\r\nnew year, in a reiteration of Ethiopia’s previous\r\ndeclaration of war, its President publicly announced that\r\nEthiopia would use force to impose its will over disputed\r\nterritory. That was a blatant repudiation of the OAU\r\neffort, all of whose documents had been endorsed by the\r\nUnited Nations and other concerned organizations and\r\nGovernments.\r\nThe OAU has given Ethiopia clear and unambiguous\r\nclarifications in response to its queries and concerns. It is\r\nalso to be recalled that the OAU had decided, and both\r\nparties had accepted, that any interpretation of the\r\ndocuments would be made solely by the OAU and its\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ncurrent Chairman. The OAU and the United Nations have\r\nalso agreed to become guarantors of the scrupulous\r\nimplementation of all the provisions of the OAU peace\r\npackage. Ethiopia’s latest threat of war and its consequent\r\nrepudiation of its commitment to the OAU peace process,\r\nwhich is inflexible about the peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict, are thus in contempt of the OAU, the United\r\nNations and the international community. Ethiopia’s refusal\r\nto accept the technical arrangements until its new set of\r\npreconditions are met is holding the peace process hostage\r\nin spite of the clamour of the international community for\r\nthe acceptance and quick implementation of the peace plan.\r\nHowever quixotic and unjustifiable it may be, the\r\nEthiopian Government has declared that it will not accept\r\nthe technical arrangements until it receives from the OAU\r\na firm assurance of Ethiopian sovereignty over the disputed\r\nareas. Obviously, this is a direct contradiction of, and a\r\nfrontal assault on, the Framework Agreement, whose\r\nprovisions clearly declare that the\r\n“redeployment will not prejudge the final status of the\r\narea concerned, which will be determined at the end\r\nof the delimitation and demarcation of the border and,\r\nif need be, through an appropriate mechanism of\r\narbitration”. (S/1998/1223, annex, p. 25)\r\nSurely, the proposition that a State must a priori be\r\nawarded full sovereignty over contested territory before the\r\ndetermination of ownership must distort the norms of\r\ninternational law and international relations. Ethiopia has\r\nalso claimed that its decision to use force to control\r\ncontested areas was taken in self-defence. Such a notion\r\nrelegates the concept of self-defence to the realm of self-\r\nhelp.\r\nIt is not difficult to conclude which party to the\r\nEritrean-Ethiopian conflict has undertaken to fulfil in good\r\nfaith its obligations under the OAU peace package and\r\nwhich party is determined to undermine, by direct or\r\nindirect aggression, the Charters of the United Nations and\r\nthe OAU, thereby endangering peace, security, stability and\r\npeaceful development in our region. It is not difficult to\r\ndetermine which of the parties is resolved to bring about\r\nterritorial changes, in clear violation of the OAU and\r\nUnited Nations Charters, by aggression, coercion,\r\ninfiltration and subterfuge. A perfunctory analysis of the\r\nmedia — particularly the broadcast media — of both\r\ncountries will also reveal which of the parties is fanning the\r\nflames of ethnic hatred and is actively engaged in\r\npropaganda and in preparation for a new war, thereby\r\ncommitting a crime against peace. In short, it is very easy\r\nto identify which of the parties is committed to peace and\r\nwhich is committed to war and aggression.\r\nOnce again, war clouds are looming ominously over\r\nour region. It is now self-evident that the Ethiopian\r\nGovernment is still determined to pursue a policy\r\npredicated on violent aggression. By its shrill war\r\nhysteria, the Government of Ethiopia is making it clear\r\nthat it is poised to invade our country yet again. It is not\r\nour wish to fight. The bitter experience of a long war of\r\nindependence has taught us to dread war. We seek no\r\nterritorial expansion, and we have no plan to commit\r\naggression against any other State. We seek to live in\r\npeaceful cooperation with all our neighbours. Yet if war\r\nis imposed on us we must — and will — fight to\r\nsafeguard the sovereignty of our country and to preserve\r\nour dignity as a people. In this connection, Eritrea\r\nsolemnly declares in this Assembly that the responsibility\r\nfor any new military engagement will lie with the Addis\r\nAbaba regime.\r\nWe have exercised prudence and patience in the face\r\nof aggression, provocation and crimes committed by the\r\nGovernment of Ethiopia against our nationals in Ethiopia\r\nand Eritrea. A State has the duty to protect its nationals\r\nfrom injury caused by the Government of any State. Yet\r\nEritrea has hitherto preferred to react with equanimity to\r\nthe gross and violent violations of the human rights of\r\nEritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin in the hope of\r\nsecuring a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\r\nHowever, there are limits to the misdoings that any\r\nrespectable State must tolerate. It would be unacceptable\r\nfor any Government worthy of the trust of its people not\r\nto defend the State and the people it represents against\r\naggression. It would be an unthinkable calamity for a\r\npeople which had fought for so long, endured\r\nunimaginable hardship and won its independence against\r\nall odds to lose its rights as a people and a nation to an\r\naggressor.\r\nIt is incumbent on those who love freedom and\r\njustice and respect the equality of peoples, who are\r\ncommitted to peace and cherish the norms and principles\r\nof the United Nations, to ensure that law and moral\r\nprinciples prevail against international lawlessness and\r\nimmorality.\r\nEthiopia’s threatened aggression must be a source of\r\ndeep concern to the international community and\r\nparticularly to the OAU and the United Nations which\r\nhave consistently urged both parties to restrain themselves\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nfrom the use or threat of force and to solve the conflict by\r\npeaceful means.\r\nTo this end, the international community must insist\r\nthat both parties recognize and respect each other’s right to\r\nlive in peace within secure and recognized borders. It is for\r\nthis reason that Eritrea believes that this Assembly has the\r\nduty to uphold the decision of the OAU, which has already\r\nbeen endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, and\r\ncalls upon the Assembly to denounce Ethiopia’s renewed\r\npreparation for war against Eritrea and to demand that it\r\naccept and implement the OAU peace package. Surely, if\r\nthere is any lesson that must have been learned in the last\r\n16 months, it is that nothing can be gained, and everything\r\nmay be lost, by continued warfare.\r\nTherefore, the Government of Eritrea calls upon the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community to: first,\r\ncondemn Ethiopia’s commitment to the use and threat of\r\nforce; secondly, establish a short time-frame within which\r\nEthiopia must definitively respond to the peace package;\r\nthirdly, take timely and appropriate measures for the\r\nimmediate and unconditional implementation of the OAU\r\npeace plan in its entirety; and, fourthly, immediately deploy\r\nan observer mission to identify the aggression in the event\r\nof renewed conflict.\r\nThe President: I next give the floor to the Minister of\r\nExternal Relations of Angola, His Excellency Mr. Joao\r\nBernardo de Miranda.\r\nMr. Miranda (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): Allow me, to begin, Sir,\r\nby congratulating you on behalf of the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Angola, and on my own behalf, on your\r\nelection as president of the General Assembly at this fifty-\r\nfourth session. Your election to such an important post is\r\nrecognition of your experience, ability and diplomatic\r\ncapacity, as well as of Namibia’s role internationally.\r\nAngola and Namibia not only share a long common border,\r\nbut also have close political, economic, cultural and\r\nhistorical links. We sincerely hope that your mandate will\r\nbe crowned with success.\r\nOur congratulations also go to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, for the excellent work carried out\r\nduring his mandate.\r\nTo the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, we would like also to express our thanks for\r\nthe wise and transparent manner in which he has led our\r\nOrganization.\r\nIt is also a pleasure for us to welcome the new\r\nmembers of the United Nations, the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Their\r\naccession reflects the universal nature of the principles\r\nand rules of the United Nations Charter. Angola is\r\nconvinced that these States will be able to successfully\r\ntake up their responsibilities, thereby contributing to the\r\nstrengthening of our Organization and the stability and\r\ndevelopment of the South Pacific region and the world as\r\na whole.\r\nFor half a century, the Organization has carried out\r\nactivities to promote the ideals contained in its Charter.\r\nWith the end of the cold war we thought that large-scale\r\nfratricidal wars would be things of the past; that the world\r\nwould no longer experience tension and insecurity; that\r\nby now we would be in a position to welcome a\r\nnarrowing of the gap between the rich and poor countries;\r\nthat a significant part of humanity would be free from the\r\ndanger of dying of poverty and misery. However, these\r\nthings have not happened. The world is hostage to itself.\r\nThere is a plethora of new armed conflicts as a result of\r\nhatred and racial, ethnic and religious intolerance; of the\r\ndenial of people’s right to self-determination; and even of\r\nthe unfathomable ambition of certain politicians to take\r\npower by force or to attempt to thwart peoples’ sovereign\r\nwill to choose their own destinies.\r\nThe proliferation of armed conflicts is, to some\r\nextent, a reflection of the absence of an international\r\nsecurity system under the aegis of the United Nations that\r\nwould be able to respond immediately and correctly to\r\npotential conflicts. Despite instability in various areas of\r\nthe world, there has been a weak commitment to\r\nestablishing such a security system because of a lack of\r\npolitical will on the part of certain members of the\r\ninternational community. This indicates that the world is\r\nstill very far from achieving the long-desired peace and\r\ndevelopment. Worse yet is the fact that certain entities of\r\ninternational law approach the need for peace in the world\r\nfrom a perspective of material and global strategic\r\ninterests — and at the expense of the universal human\r\nvalues.\r\nIt weighs on our conscience to see that we still have\r\na long way to go to find solutions to situations of this\r\nnature, and that the international community’s reactions\r\nto similar situations of human suffering are not consistent.\r\nThese facts might lead us to believe that we are\r\ndealing with a double standard and with measured\r\npolicies that are at variance with the spirit and letter of\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The United Nations and\r\nthe international community as a whole have the political,\r\nlegal and moral duty to work a little harder, so that peoples\r\nfacing the scourge of the war will be able to achieve lasting\r\npeace. The main objective of the United Nations can be\r\nachieved worldwide, provided that there is coherence and\r\ndetermination in the application of principles and decisions.\r\nThe global tolerance of impunity has been encouraging\r\nthe leaders of the rebel groups proliferating throughout the\r\nworld to carry out their terrorist and destructive campaigns,\r\nthe main victim of which is civil society. The differential\r\ntreatment accorded to identical situations of systematic and\r\nmassive violations of human rights and the war crimes that\r\nare occurring in some areas of the world makes it\r\nimpossible for the international justice system to act with\r\nthe required effectiveness in dealing with some of the most\r\nbarbaric and bloodthirsty criminals that Africa has seen this\r\ncentury. We are convinced that if the political and moral\r\npower of the United Nations were exerted against all the\r\nperpetrators of serious crimes, it would dishearten all those\r\nwho might be willing to resort to subversion and terrorism.\r\nThus the international community would be preventing the\r\nemergence of new conflicts.\r\nWe are fully aware that States have the primary\r\nresponsibility for paving the way for the prevention of\r\nconflicts. The implementation of democracy, which may\r\npromote respect for human rights and the establishment of\r\nneighbourly relations, may be able to contribute to\r\npreventing the occurrence of conflicts. Indeed, many of the\r\ncurrent crises would not have lasted long if the States\r\ninvolved in them had, in good faith, fully complied with\r\ntheir international obligations as set forth in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and as established by regional\r\norganizations. I refer in particular to the principle of\r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States. For\r\nthis reason, the mechanisms for the fulfilment of such\r\ninternational obligations by States should be further\r\nreinforced.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Angola commends\r\nthe work undertaken by the Secretary-General regarding the\r\nreinforcement of the preventive diplomacy mechanisms.\r\nHowever, the increase in the number of wars, particularly\r\nsince 1998, leads us to conclude that the efforts in this\r\nregard still fall short of reaching the objectives. It is thus\r\nnecessary for us to strive to create the institutional capacity\r\nfor conflict prevention, including regional early-warning\r\nmechanisms.\r\nRegarding conflict resolution, Angola’s experiences\r\nforce us to stress that there is an urgent need to re-define\r\nmethods and strategies, mainly in the field of\r\npeacekeeping operations. Other factors underlying the\r\nlimited success of some peacekeeping missions carried\r\nout under the aegis of the United Nations are: the obvious\r\nfrailty of the verification systems of peace agreements;\r\nthe tendency to treat similarly the violator and the fulfiller\r\nof these agreements; the overlooking of early signs that\r\nsuggest a lack of political will and ill-faith by one of the\r\nsides; and the subsequent delayed application of coercive\r\nmeasures.\r\nAs a member State of the international community\r\nwe need to rely on and have recourse to the United\r\nNations in its important role regarding the issues of\r\npeacekeeping and security in the world. Angola will\r\ncontinue to believe that, in order to establish peace in the\r\nworld, the United Nations role is of paramount\r\nimportance. We simply want to suggest that, given the\r\ncurrent international situation, this role should be played\r\nin a more realistic and effective way, with a view to\r\nliving up to the expectations of people eager for peace\r\nand to ensuring the credibility of our Organization.\r\nI would like now to refer to the situation in Angola,\r\nwhere five years have passed since the Lusaka Protocol\r\nwas signed between the Government and UNITA.\r\nHowever, the main tasks involved in attaining a lasting\r\npeace have not yet been achieved. In particular, UNITA\r\nhas not been completely disarmed and State authority has\r\nnot been restored in the illegally occupied areas. Rather,\r\nthe persistent refusal of the rebels to fully honour their\r\nobligations and their preference for taking power by force\r\nhave plunged the country into a new era of violence.\r\nFollowing this rejection of the people’s will, as\r\nexpressed at the polls during the 1992 general elections,\r\nand the non-fulfilment of the provisions of the three peace\r\naccords entered into with the Government — in 1989 in\r\nGbadolite, in the former Zaire; in 1991 in Portugal and in\r\n1994 in Lusaka — Mr. Savimbi is still interested in\r\ncontinuing his destabilization campaign. This includes\r\npreventing the smooth running of the democratic\r\ninstitutions; destroying cities, towns, villages,\r\ninfrastructure and public and private assets; and\r\nmercilessly killing civilians. In this way he has been\r\ncondemning to misery, disease and famine all of the\r\npeople in Angola.\r\nAs a result of these actions, in addition to the\r\nthousands of civilians who have already been killed,\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nalmost 3 million others have left their homes in search of\r\nrefuge in the Government-controlled areas. Those\r\ncommunities require humanitarian assistance from the\r\ninternational community. In the framework of the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol, the Government\r\nhas, in good faith, undertaken all the tasks provided for it\r\nin the peace accords, in spite of the fact that Savimbi and\r\nhis military wing have resumed the war. The Government\r\ncontinues to ensure the functioning of the democratic\r\ninstitutions resulting from the general elections, and UNITA\r\nmembers are represented in the Government and the\r\nparliament.\r\nIn the national armed forces, military troops, officials\r\nand soldiers appointed by UNITA remain faithful to the\r\nideals of democracy and national accord. Only Mr. Savimbi\r\nand a fairly reduced number of qualified personnel who\r\nremain faithful to him are still interested in making war\r\nwith a view to taking power. All of Savimbi’s propaganda\r\nof recent years has merely been playing for time and\r\nanticipating that developments on the international scene\r\nmight come out in his favour. His false messages on\r\nnegotiations, allowing him time to prepare the ground for\r\nnew military adventures, are elements of that strategy.\r\nIndeed, what remains to be done in the Angolan peace\r\nprocess is to enforce what was negotiated in-depth at\r\nLusaka over an entire year, particularly the disarming of all\r\nof Mr. Jonas Savimbi’s military forces and the restoration\r\nof state administration throughout the national territory. The\r\nAngolan Government has long waited for Savimbi to decide\r\nto opt for peace. Angola is currently facing other political\r\nand economic challenges that cannot be indefinitely\r\npostponed as a result of the actions of a single power-\r\nhungry individual who considers war to be the only way to\r\nfulfil his personal plans. Furthermore, in rejecting\r\nSavimbi’s posture, many UNITA militants and leaders have\r\ndistanced him from the party. These women and men are\r\nworking in good faith to consolidate the Angolan\r\ndemocratic process.\r\nGiven Savimbi’s obstructionist behaviour, the Security\r\nCouncil decided to impose global mandatory sanctions\r\nagainst UNITA, including the prohibition of international\r\ntravel for top UNITA officials directly involved in the\r\nAngola war project. In the same vein, and as a result of the\r\ncrimes that Savimbi has been committing against the\r\ncivilian population, the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) and the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) declared him a war criminal and thus an unreliable\r\nstakeholder in the implementation of peace in Angola. The\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, in its ministerial meeting of 23\r\nSeptember 1999 held here in New York, expressed its\r\nstrong support for the resolution adopted at the recent\r\nOAU Summit, which deems Mr. Savimbi a war criminal\r\nand requires that he be treated as such by the entire\r\ninternational community. We trust that there is no further\r\ndoubt about the criminal nature of Mr. Savimbi or the\r\nneed for him to be held responsible internationally for his\r\ncrimes and actions.\r\nThe Angolan Government reiterates its ongoing\r\ncommitment to paving the way for a lasting peace and, to\r\nthat end, to making use of all the means at its disposal,\r\nand undertakes to proceed with the process of national\r\nreconciliation and social democratization. A clear\r\ndemonstration of its commitment is the fact that, despite\r\nthe war climate pervading the country, at no time\r\nwhatsoever has the Government denied the rights and\r\nindividual liberties of citizens or of national legal political\r\nforces.\r\nIn the framework of the political reforms initiated in\r\n1991, a new constitution is being prepared in a process in\r\nwhich all political parties are participating. The new\r\nconstitutional text will reinforce the rule of law and\r\nconsolidate the type of society that we intend to establish\r\nin Angola: an economically prosperous one under\r\ndemocratic rule of law and a State of social justice. In the\r\neconomic context, the reforms will follow their course\r\nwith a view to reinforcing the creation of other conditions\r\nfor an effective market economy and of a more\r\nfavourable environment for foreign investment.\r\nIn order to meet these challenges, we call for the\r\nsupport and solidarity of the international community,\r\nparticularly regarding the implementation of sanctions\r\nimposed by the Security Council against UNITA, so that\r\nAngola can more rapidly achieve peace and consolidate\r\nand accelerate the economic reform process.\r\nIt is our sincere hope that the new initiatives of the\r\nSecurity Council, proposed by Ambassador Robert\r\nFowler, Chairman of the Committee on Sanctions, as well\r\nas the support already expressed by some Governments\r\nand international institutions, may contribute significantly\r\nto reinforcing sanctions, dismantling the illegal diamond-\r\ntrafficking network, which is subsidizing the war carried\r\nout by Savimbi, and bringing its perpetrators before the\r\ncourt.\r\nIn tandem with its efforts to implement peace, the\r\nAngolan Government is also committed to implementing\r\nsocial-impact economic programmes and to relaunching\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nthe basis for the resettlement of communities with a view\r\nto economically rehabilitating the country. In this regard,\r\nwe wish to call upon all United Nations Member States to\r\nsupport the draft resolution that Angola will submit to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on economic rehabilitation. In addition\r\nto lending their support to the draft resolution, we call on\r\nour partners particularly to participate in the economic\r\nrehabilitation of Angola.\r\nThe disarming of anti-personal landmines is another\r\ntask that requires the ongoing involvement and support of\r\nthe international community. The Angolan Government will\r\nremain engaged at the national, regional and international\r\nlevels in order to overcome that scourge. A clear\r\ndemonstration of this determination is the fact that we were\r\none of the first State parties to the Ottawa Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.\r\nThe security, stability and territorial integrity of\r\nAngola and its neighbours depend on the stability of the\r\nregion. We are currently facing a dangerous increase of\r\ndestabilization which, if not controlled, may seriously affect\r\nthe development of that part of the continent. Angola will\r\ncontinue to lend its support, under SADC, to the\r\nimplementation of peace in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. The Ceasefire Agreement signed in Lusaka and its\r\ncomplete fulfilment will pave the way for the return of\r\nrefugees and the initiation of dialogue between the\r\nCongolese political forces, to which falls the responsibility\r\nof deciding the destiny of their country. The United Nations\r\nand the OAU are also called upon to play a crucial role in\r\nthe establishment of a lasting peace. It would be reasonable\r\nfor the invading countries to make a gesture by\r\nwithdrawing from Congolese territory and ceasing to\r\nexpand their occupation.\r\nIn the African Horn, Angola welcomes the acceptance\r\nby the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea of the\r\nFramework Agreement prepared by the OAU with a view\r\nto settling the dispute between the two countries. We wish\r\nto call upon both countries to demonstrate flexibility in\r\norder to ensure that a peace agreement, taking into account\r\nthe interests of their peoples, can be celebrated.\r\nWith respect to Somalia, we call upon the international\r\ncommunity to support the efforts of the OAU to reconcile\r\nthe political and military factions and to establish an elected\r\nGovernment so that the country can resume its place in the\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nIn Western Sahara, the fulfilment of the Ceasefire\r\nAgreement enabled the further development of the joint\r\nefforts of the United Nations and the OAU leading to the\r\nholding of a referendum. Angola expects the process to\r\nbe transparent and fair and that both parties shall accept\r\nthe verdict of the Sahraoui people.\r\nConcerning East Timor, whose people is connected\r\nto Angola by a shared language and a historical past of\r\nstruggle against Portuguese colonization, we were\r\ndisturbed by the acts of violence that followed the\r\nannouncement of the results of the popular consultation.\r\nThe decision of East Timor’s people in favour of self-\r\ndetermination and independence should be respected. It is\r\nnow the United Nations responsibility to prepare an\r\nenabling environment. In this regard, we strongly support\r\nthe dispatch of a United Nations international peace force.\r\nAs to the Middle East, Angola welcomes the\r\ncelebration of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements between\r\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority that have enabled the\r\npeace process to be relaunched. It is our view that the\r\nnew agreements conform to the aspirations of the\r\nrespective peoples to living in peace and security.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Angola and its\r\npeople are concerned about the difficult political,\r\neconomic and social situation of the Cuban people, which\r\nhas worsened under the ongoing economic embargo\r\nimposed on their country. We hope that the matter will be\r\nresolved through a constructive bilateral dialogue.\r\nThe latest international developments and the\r\nchallenges of the next millennium require that the United\r\nNations and its main bodies, particularly those dealing\r\nwith peace and security, economic development and the\r\nadministration of international justice, be adjusted to the\r\nnew situation.\r\nReform and an increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council will be crucial to making the\r\ndecision-making process more transparent. In this respect,\r\nit is essential that all the regions of the world be\r\nrepresented equally. Angola reaffirms the position of the\r\nnon-aligned countries on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as the common African position adopted\r\nby the OAU.\r\nDespite the progress achieved in some economies\r\nand the disappearance of the signs of a new world\r\ndepression, the international economic situation continues\r\nto be characterized by serious imbalances. The root\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ncauses of the difficult situation faced by some developing\r\ncountries include the unfair system governing international\r\neconomic, monetary and financial relations; the adoption of\r\nprotectionist measures; the unilateral nature of world trade;\r\nand the worsening of the external debt, which has become\r\na heavy burden for the developing countries.\r\nIt is necessary to take concrete measures which may\r\nlead to structural changes in international economic\r\nrelations and may contribute to the balance of the world\r\neconomy. To this end, there should be a serious and\r\ntransparent will in the North-South dialogue.\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Internal\r\nAffairs of the Marshall Islands, His Excellency Mr. Hiroshi\r\nYamamura.\r\nMr. Yamamura (Marshall Islands): Mr. President, on\r\nbehalf of my delegation, I congratulate you on your election\r\nto preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession. I bring you warm greetings from His Excellency\r\nPresident Imata Kabua of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands. He asks that I bring to the attention of the General\r\nAssembly the various concerns that we wish to see\r\naddressed this year.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, the Marshall Islands was\r\nchosen for nuclear testing activities for the good of\r\nmankind. It did not turn out to be so fortunate for many of\r\nour people. The testing displaced many, and many were\r\naffected by the contamination. The Marshall Islands\r\ncontinues to be haunted by a legacy of nuclear testing and\r\nthe destruction that accompanied it. My own home island,\r\nUtirik, was severely affected, and as I speak today we feel\r\nthat there has not been a full reckoning of this dreadful part\r\nof our history. We have spoken about the medical effects,\r\nthe high costs of treating the victims and the costs of\r\nrehabilitating the affected areas. A recent study has proved\r\nthat the thyroid cancer rate in the population alive at the\r\ntime of the testing is very high. We are experiencing the\r\neffects of these ailments decades after the end of the tests.\r\nThe medical and social problems that were caused do not\r\nseem likely to go away.\r\nThat being said, there are some positive developments\r\narising from our talks with our former Administering\r\nAuthority. Recent discussions have highlighted the need to\r\nmove forward with positive measures, and this is something\r\nwe fully support. The problems we face are, however, very\r\ndifficult, and the international expertise we require is\r\nsimply not forthcoming. We therefore reiterate the call we\r\nmade at the 1995 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review\r\nConference that such expertise for medical measures, as\r\nwell as scientific and technical assistance, must be made\r\navailable. We have sought to have the year 2000 Review\r\nConference fully reflect this concern. If these issues are\r\nnot addressed, it is our considered view that\r\nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament in general will\r\nbe a hollow achievement.\r\nI am grateful, Mr. President, for the efficient manner\r\nin which you conducted the proceedings of the twenty-\r\nsecond special session. That session will serve as a\r\nhighlight among our achievements this year, and I hope\r\nthat it will usher in a new dawn of international\r\ncooperation with the small island developing States.\r\nThe concerns that were raised at the special session\r\nneed not be repeated here. However, we must now look\r\nat how to integrate these concerns into other work of the\r\nUnited Nations in the field of sustainable development. It\r\nwould be counterproductive if the outcomes from last\r\nweek were not fully reflected in our other deliberations.\r\nThe full agenda before the Second Committee is\r\nindicative of the continued concern with these issues. We\r\nwill seek to ensure full reflection of the special session at\r\nthe appropriate time. At the national level we will do our\r\npart through the National Commission on sustainable\r\ndevelopment. At the regional level we will cooperate with\r\nthe other organizations of the Pacific island countries.\r\nThe interlinkages between various conventions and\r\nsustainable development efforts have always been clear to\r\nmy delegation. We are deeply concerned with climate\r\nchange and the devastating effect it may have on our\r\nlivelihood, culture, natural resources, the economy and\r\nour very existence. Climate change is with us now. It\r\nmust be stressed that bad weather is not climate change.\r\nHowever, the extreme events that have been observed in\r\nrecent years are indications of what is to be expected\r\nfrom climate change. Climate change is the disease, and\r\nwhat we are observing are the symptoms.\r\nIn the Pacific we have experienced a number of\r\nsevere weather events and changes to our normal climate.\r\nKiribati and the northern Cook Islands have become\r\nwetter, while Fiji and Tonga have become drier. In Samoa\r\nthe difference between daytime and night-time\r\ntemperatures has decreased. The southern Cook Islands\r\nand Tonga have also become warmer. The drought that\r\nhit the Marshall Islands last year was so bad that\r\nhouseholds could not get even two hours of fresh water\r\nper week.\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nFor small island developing States it is not just a\r\nquestion of waiting to see what the research will say. We\r\nhave to take action now. What happens to the small islands\r\nwill impact on the rest of the world sooner rather than later.\r\nWe also expect that the industrialized countries will take\r\nprecautionary measures. Anything less is an invitation to\r\nthe genocide of island peoples around the world.\r\nThe industrialized countries should urgently reduce\r\ntheir emissions, and others should follow suit. We ourselves\r\nare taking steps to limit our already very small emissions.\r\nPart of our effort is to develop our renewable energy sector.\r\nIn this regard, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the\r\nGovernment has approved a solar energy policy. The first\r\nstage will be a project to install solar panels on all the outer\r\nisland health centres and one of the high schools. With the\r\nsupport of the United Nations Trust Fund for New and\r\nRenewable Sources of Energy and the Government of Italy,\r\nwe hope to begin implementing this project very soon, as\r\nwell as the overall policy. The policy will assist us in\r\ngenerating sustainable livelihoods in the outer island\r\ncommunities.\r\nThe Marshall Islands was honoured to host the\r\nAlliance of Small Island States workshop on climate change\r\nthis year, and we commend the outcome to all\r\nGovernments. We would like to express our appreciation to\r\nItaly, Norway, the United States, Canada and Switzerland\r\nfor supporting the workshop and the United Nations Trust\r\nFund for providing the experts.\r\nAs the custodian of three-quarters of a million square\r\nmiles of ocean, the Marshall Islands is continuing its\r\nendeavours to seek equitable solutions for the governance\r\nof the oceans. We are cognizant that the activities that take\r\nplace in our neighbouring seas will have an effect on the\r\nsustainable development of the marine resources within our\r\nexclusive economic zone.\r\nUnsustainable fishing practices such as the use of drift\r\nnets and small mesh sizes must therefore be banned\r\nforever. The Marshall Islands has been working together\r\nwith the Pacific island countries to develop a regional treaty\r\nthat would address implementation of fisheries conservation\r\nand their sustainable management. Various aspects of\r\nimportance include the need for data collection, vessel\r\nmonitoring systems, and greater support for our patrol\r\nboats. We also need to look at limiting the fleets permitted\r\nto fish in our waters; this would also assist us in further\r\ndeveloping our domestic fleet.\r\nMy Government applauds the efforts of the Pacific\r\nForum, in particular the Permanent Representative of\r\nPapua New Guinea who, in cooperation with the Rio\r\nGroup, has brought this matter forward. We will continue\r\nto seek common-sense solutions to the vexing problems\r\nthat confront us in ocean matters.\r\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Marshall\r\nIslands has responsibility for and is predominantly\r\nfocused on the social development and improvement in\r\nthe lives of our people in the outer island communities.\r\nOne such example is the solar power project I mentioned.\r\nWe are constantly engaged in seeking solutions to address\r\nthese concerns, one such event being national economic\r\nand social summit. Through the outcome of that summit,\r\nwe are striving to bring about the partnerships that these\r\ncommunities require for their economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Many exciting new ideas have come\r\nforward, especially for the development of agriculture,\r\nfisheries and sustainable tourism. What is lacking is\r\nconcerted donor support, but we are hopeful that with\r\ndetailed and pragmatic proposals this situation will\r\nchange.\r\nEarlier this year, at the Preparatory Committee for\r\nthe follow-up to the Copenhagen Social Summit, I\r\noutlined some of the problems we face and the possible\r\nsolutions we proposed. Those ideas are still valid. My\r\ndelegation will continue to stress the need for support for\r\nthese efforts during this session and at the special session\r\non social development next year.\r\nWomen’s rights are a cornerstone of the Marshall\r\nIslands Constitution. As a matrilineal society, we have a\r\ncultural attachment to the promotion of the rights of all\r\npeople, but especially for the women of our society. We\r\nhave in place a unit in the Ministry of Internal Affairs to\r\nassist in the implementation of our policy on women and\r\nto address the achievements of women in our society. I\r\ncan inform the Assembly that a national caucus of women\r\nwas recently established to increase further their\r\ninvolvement in the political decision-making process. My\r\ndelegation will actively participate in the preparatory\r\nwork for the special session on the implementation of the\r\nBeijing Conference to be held next year.\r\nEqually important to the Marshall Islands are human\r\nrights in the general sense. We have tried to give practical\r\nimplementation to the ideals that we all hold dear. The\r\nMarshall Islands Constitution defines respect for human\r\nrights as the fundamental obligation of the Government.\r\nIt sets out the basic parameters for the holding of free\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nelections, the right of free speech and thought, and the right\r\nto economic and social development. We hold these\r\nprinciples in high regard, and indeed we are currently in the\r\nprocess of holding general elections to the Parliament and\r\nto the local governments. The elections are free and fair,\r\nand open to the most stringent oversight to ensure there is\r\nno interference in the free choice of the people.\r\nIn line with our efforts to consolidate our democracy\r\nand our free institutions, we are looking at the opportunities\r\nin the various human rights instruments of the United\r\nNations. I hope to be able to report soon that we will\r\nbecome party to the most important of these instruments,\r\neven though I would contend that our Constitution already\r\ngives full voice to these rights. In this regard, we were very\r\nheartened to hear what the Secretary-General had to say on\r\nthe subject. We think that he pinpointed the real issue here:\r\nthat it is people who are the most important, that it is\r\nadherence to human rights that we must safeguard. We will\r\nsupport all efforts to see to it that new initiatives are given\r\nproper consideration.\r\nAs a small but determined democracy, the Marshall\r\nIslands supported the inclusion of the agenda item on the\r\nneed to examine the exceptional international situation\r\npertaining to the Republic of China on Taiwan and ensure\r\nthat the fundamental right of its 22 million people to\r\nparticipate in the work and activities of the United Nations\r\nis fully respected. We hope to achieve a resolution of this\r\nmatter in the near future. There is still a need for an ad hoc\r\ncommittee to be established to examine the matter further.\r\nThe United Nations has come a long way on the path\r\nto reform, which we all know is an ongoing process, never\r\na single event. My delegation congratulates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his outstanding efforts: he deserves our full\r\nsupport and thanks. But the reforms so far made are in\r\njeopardy because of the continued non-payment of\r\ncontributions by certain Members. This is intolerable and\r\ncannot continue: the support from Member States cannot\r\nfalter. We must all pay our dues on time, in full and\r\nwithout conditions.\r\nAs part of this reform process, we too have noted the\r\nanomalies in the regional groupings here at the United\r\nNations. We think it is high time to review this matter, as\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and\r\nSamoa have all eloquently pointed out.\r\nThere is also a need to finalize the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. In this regard, I wish to thank the\r\ndelegation of Italy for its reasonable and logical\r\ncontribution to our debate on this matter.\r\nWe must also ensure that the United Nations\r\nagencies are responsive to the special needs of the\r\ndeveloping countries. The Marshall Islands has benefited\r\nto some extent from various United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) projects. We feel that more can be\r\ndone, and we look forward to increasing our cooperation\r\nwith United Nations agencies, such as UNDP, the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations\r\nChildren\u0027s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) and others.\r\nIn conclusion, Mr. President, you can count on the\r\nfull support and cooperation of the Marshall Islands\r\ndelegation to assist you in bringing our deliberations to a\r\nfruitful conclusion.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise\r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second\r\nintervention, and should be made by delegations from\r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): First, the Assembly has heard, not for the first\r\ntime, statements by the Israeli representative against\r\npeace — statements based on the falsification of facts and\r\nattempts to mislead the international community. The\r\nstatement by the Israeli representative yesterday was but\r\nan expression of the policy of the previous Israeli\r\nGovernment, a policy that we hope will not be pursued by\r\nthe new Government.\r\nSecondly, the denial by the Israeli representative in\r\nhis statement yesterday of the message transmitted by\r\nformer Prime Minister Rabin to Syria in July 1994\r\nthrough the United States, the sponsor of the peace\r\nprocess, shows either that the representative is ignorant of\r\nthe existence of the message or that he has chosen\r\npurposely to ignore it because of his enmity for peace.\r\nThat peace proceeds from relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, the principle of land for peace and the\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nformula of full withdrawal in return for comprehensive\r\npeace.\r\nThirdly, our intention now is not merely to rebut the\r\nstatement by the Israeli representative. It is primarily, as I\r\nstated yesterday, to inform the international community,\r\nwhich supports the achievement of a just, comprehensive\r\npeace in the Middle East, of the developments on the\r\nSyrian track during the peace talks under the mandate of\r\nformer Prime Minister Rabin.\r\nThe United States Secretary of State informed Syria at\r\nthat time — in July 1994 — of Rabin\u0027s agreement to\r\nwithdraw from the Golan Heights to the line of 4 June 1967\r\nas an ineluctable commitment to proceed to a full treatment\r\nof the remaining elements of a full peace agreement. It\r\nmust be stated in this context that President Hafez Al-Assad\r\nhad put two questions to the former Secretary of State of\r\nthe United States at the time, to ascertain the accuracy and\r\ncorrectness of the substance of this Israeli commitment as\r\ntransmitted to Syria then.\r\nThe first question was: Does Rabin mean that Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from the Golan Heights will include all the\r\nterritories that were under Syrian sovereignty on 4 June\r\n1967? The reply of the United States Secretary of State was\r\n“Yes”. The second question put by President Assad was: Is\r\nthere any Israeli claim to any tract of land inside the 4 June\r\n1967 line? The reply of the United States Secretary of State\r\nwas that there was no such claim.\r\nFourthly, the statement of the Syrian Arab Republic\r\nmade by Mr. Farouk Al-Shará, Foreign Minister of the\r\nSyrian Arab Republic before this session of the Assembly\r\naffirmed that the message does not in itself represent a\r\npeace agreement. It is, however, a fundamental part of that\r\nagreement, an agreement whose remaining parts that pertain\r\nto normal peaceful relations and to security arrangements,\r\nbased on the principles and objectives set, with the\r\nsponsorship and participation of the United States of\r\nAmerica, should be implemented.\r\nMr. Al-Shará also affirmed in his statement that Syria\r\ndid not wish to let this opportunity for peace be lost.\r\nHowever, if it were indeed to be lost again, Israel alone\r\nwould bear the responsibility.\r\nMr. Larraín (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I should like\r\nto refer to the statement made this morning by the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Bolivia. I reiterate that there is no\r\nterritorial or border problem pending between Chile and\r\nBolivia. The borders between the two countries were\r\ndefinitively established in 1904 by the treaty of peace and\r\nfriendship, which is still fully in force.\r\nI should also recall that diplomatic relations between\r\nour countries were unilaterally suspended by Bolivia over\r\ntwo decades ago. Nevertheless, trade, investment, tourism\r\nand bilateral cooperation mechanisms are running\r\nsmoothly. Chile is, as ever, willing to have a direct,\r\nunconditional dialogue with Bolivia to continue forging\r\nahead with bilateral integration, for the further\r\ndevelopment of both peoples.\r\nMr. Menkerios (Eritrea): It was bewildering to\r\nlisten to the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia as he described\r\nhis country as a victim of Eritrean aggression, a victim\r\nwhich had no choice but to wage war in self-defence. It\r\nis a case of the thief crying “Thief!” In fact, it is Ethiopia\r\nwhich has systematically committed aggression against\r\nEritrea, and it is Eritrea which has since May 1997 been\r\ndefending its sovereignty and territorial integrity against\r\nrepeated Ethiopian aggression. Allow me to comment on\r\nthat and a few other charges that were made.\r\nOn the question of aggression, I do not want to go\r\ninto the details of the process, from the issuing of a new\r\nofficial map that changed the borders and included large\r\nchunks of Eritrean territory in Ethiopia to the systematic\r\nstep-by-step incursion into that territory by force, leading\r\nto the eruption of the fighting. This has been documented\r\nin the past, and we can distribute documents to that\r\neffect. These are actual facts. I will simply say that the\r\nseries of incidents, or incursions, culminated on 6 May\r\n1998, with Ethiopian troops cold-bloodedly murdering a\r\nnumber of Eritrean officers and soldiers in the Badme\r\narea.\r\nOn 13 May 1998, the Ethiopian Parliament officially\r\ndeclared war on Eritrea. On 5 June 1998, the Addis\r\nAbaba regime launched the first air strike against Eritrea\u0027s\r\ncapital city, Asmara, attacked Eritrea throughout the\r\ncommon border and escalated what was a border skirmish\r\ninto a full-scale war. In a governmental statement issued\r\non 1 March 1999, entitled “Ethiopia is looking for a\r\nlasting peace”, the Addis Ababa Government openly\r\nadmits that its agenda extends to overthrowing the\r\ngovernment of Asmara, which has become “a threat to the\r\nregion”.\r\nThe Ethiopian Minister declares that aggression must\r\nnot be rewarded. The Eritrean delegation could not agree\r\nmore. Aggression must, in fact, be severely punished.\r\nHowever, it is neither Eritrea nor Ethiopia but the United\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nNations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\r\nother parties which must determine the commission of\r\naggression and the perpetrator of aggression. Paragraph 7\r\nof the Framework Agreement is designed to do exactly that.\r\nIt recommends that\r\n“In order to determine the origins of the conflict,\r\nan investigation be carried out on the incidents of 6\r\nMay 1998 and on any other incident prior to that date\r\nwhich could have contributed to a misunderstanding\r\nbetween the two parties regarding their common\r\nborder, including the incidents of July-August 1997.”\r\nEritrea is committed to, and readily awaits, the\r\nimplementation of this and other relevant provisions.\r\nEthiopia would also contribute to the determination of\r\naggression by signing the technical arrangements.\r\nThirdly, the commitment to peace. It is well and good\r\nfor the Addis Ababa regime to make a thousand and one\r\nclaims about its commitment to a peaceful solution. It is\r\nquite another matter to translate words into deeds. Actions\r\nspeak louder than words, and the Addis Ababa regime\r\nneeds to take one and only one action to authenticate its\r\ncommitment to peace: sign the technical arrangements and\r\naccept the peace package that has been presented by the\r\nOAU and which is supported by the United Nations and the\r\nentire international community.\r\nTurning to the issue of sovereignty over disputed\r\nterritory, Ethiopia, despite its claims to the contrary, has\r\nrejected the OAU peace plan on the pretext that the\r\ntechnical arrangements do not guarantee Ethiopia\u0027s\r\nsovereignty in its own territories. In effect, it is seeking\r\niron-clad guarantees of sovereignty over the disputed\r\nterritories. This would be like a football team refusing to\r\nplay unless it is assured beforehand of victory. This would\r\nbe farcical were it not deadly serious.\r\nThe Framework Agreement, the modalities and the\r\nOAU clarifications are crystal-clear on the matter. All three\r\ndocuments affirm that they are not meant in any way to\r\nquestion the sovereignty and authority of either of the two\r\nparties over the whole of its territory, it being mutually\r\nunderstood that the redeployment shall not prejudge the\r\nfinal status of the territories concerned, which will be\r\ndetermined at the end of the border delimitation and\r\ndemarcation process. This is what the proposal says.\r\nIn spite of this clear message by the OAU, the United\r\nNations and much of the international community, Ethiopia\r\nis demanding to be awarded the territories. In effect, it is\r\ndemanding the amendment of the Framework Agreement\r\nand the modalities which it had hitherto accepted. These\r\nare not the words of a country which seeks peace. They\r\nare the words of a country that is in search of pretexts to\r\ncommit further aggression.\r\nFifthly, with respect to the need for guarantees, it is\r\na matter of verifiable historical record that it should be\r\nEritrea, not Ethiopia, that should seek guarantees against\r\naggression. Eritrea has never, by word or by deed,\r\nthreatened or committed aggression against Ethiopia, nor\r\nis it doing so today. The Eritrean delegation wishes to\r\ninform the Assembly that Eritrea trusts the commitment\r\nof the OAU and the United Nations as guarantors of the\r\npeace, as provided for in the peace plan, which reads:\r\n“The Organization of African Unity and the\r\nUnited Nations will be the guarantors for the\r\nscrupulous implementation of all the provisions of\r\nthe OAU Framework Agreement, the modalities for\r\nthe implementation of the Framework Agreement\r\nand the technical arrangements for the\r\nimplementation of the Framework Agreement and its\r\nmodalities.”\r\nSixthly, with regard to peace and stability in the\r\nregion, it is again a matter of record that it is in fact\r\nEthiopia that has become the major destabilizing force in\r\nthe region. Its repeated invasions of Somalia with tanks,\r\narmoured vehicles and heavy artillery, its occupation of\r\nseveral towns and villages, and the murders and looting\r\nand destruction of property it has perpetrated have been\r\nverified by third-party observers. What is the truth? Ask\r\nthe Somalis. Their repeated violations of Kenyan\r\nsovereignty under the pretext of hot pursuit of Oromo\r\nLiberation Front (OLF) fighters is also a matter of public\r\nrecord.\r\nThe next point is the historical role of the\r\ninternational community. Throughout history, Ethiopia has\r\ncolluded and connived with colonial Powers in\r\ndetermining the course of the history of the region. A\r\ncursory glance at the colonial agreements in the Horn of\r\nAfrica will reveal that Ethiopia was a partner and\r\nsignatory of almost all of the colonial agreements on\r\nDjibouti, Somaliland, the Sudan and Kenya. Eritrea\u0027s\r\nforced federation with Ethiopia and its subsequent\r\nannexation by Ethiopia in violation of the United Nations\r\nresolution that arranged the federation, while the\r\ninternational community looked the other way, are but a\r\nfew examples.\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nEven now, it is Eritrea which has been forced by the\r\ninternational community to make concession after\r\nconcession for the sake of peace. And Ethiopia complains?\r\nLastly, I will turn to the unwarranted attacks on the\r\nState, Government and leadership of Eritrea. The vulgar\r\nattacks on the Government and leadership of my country\r\nare too contemptible to merit any serious response. Suffice\r\nit to say that an ethnic minority regime that has been\r\naccused of practicing ethnic apartheid by its own people\r\nand whose prisons are filled with political prisoners; which\r\nhas been labeled an enemy of the free press; which has\r\nsystematically violated the human rights of not only\r\nEritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin but also its own\r\npeople can hardly be considered as a candidate to give\r\nlectures on democracy and human rights.\r\nHowever, it provides insight into the nature of a\r\nGovernment with which Eritrea and others in our region\r\nand beyond have to deal with — and endure.\r\nMr. Yemer (Ethiopia): Aggression, unfortunately, is\r\na fact of international life. As long as there are aggressors,\r\nthere will be aggression. Now having listened to the\r\nstatement by the Foreign Minister of Eritrea this evening,\r\nI find it interesting to discern some distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of aggressors, be they large or small.\r\nIn fact, this is intriguing, because they have displayed\r\nthe same characteristics throughout history. Large or small,\r\nthey share the same features.\r\nThere are several characteristics, and I will mention\r\nthem in order of importance. First, the most distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic is that they play the victim while their\r\naggression continues. The statements made by the Foreign\r\nMinister of Eritrea and by the representative who just spoke\r\nare clear testimony to that fact. The second distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic is that they are shrill, they make a lot of\r\nnoise — more than the victims. Hitler used to do it;\r\nMussolini used to do it. The victims are quiet, and the\r\naggressors are shrill. Thirdly, they misrepresent the actual\r\nstate of affairs — that is another characteristic of\r\naggressors. That is their device. They like to hoodwink the\r\ninternational community.\r\nFourthly, they claim to be champions of peace — they\r\nbecome converts overnight. That is another characteristic of\r\naggressors; in fact, that is the most common characteristic,\r\nand the latest example is provided by Eritrea. Another\r\ncharacteristic is that they lecture the rest of the world on\r\nthe virtues of peace; they are condescending and gratuitous.\r\nFinally, and most regrettably, they underestimate the rest\r\nof the world, to the point of insulting its intelligence.\r\nEritrea is a small aggressor. All the same, it displays\r\nall the characteristics of aggressors. During the year and\r\na half of its aggression against Ethiopia it has been\r\nshowing all the characteristics of aggressors that I have\r\njust enumerated, and more. It is calling for peace while its\r\ninvading army is sitting on Ethiopian land. It claims to\r\nhave accepted, very belatedly, the peace proposals of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). In fact, these are\r\nthe very documents which it has been dismissing all\r\nalong — dismissing not in normal language or in a\r\ncivilized manner but with contempt and derision\r\naddressed not only to the proposals but also to the\r\norganization that is the author of the proposals. That is a\r\nmatter of record, and it is clear from their statements and\r\nreactions to the various proposals made over the past year\r\nand a half — before they converted to a peace-loving\r\nState.\r\nWhy have they suddenly changed and come full\r\ncircle, so that now they are professing peaceful\r\nintentions? Surely there has not been a change of heart,\r\nsince aggressors cannot undergo a metamorphosis — to\r\nuse a biological and scientific term — and become peace-\r\nloving overnight. That would be contrary to their nature,\r\nand Eritrea cannot be an exception to that rule. Rather,\r\nthe turning point came in February 1999, when Eritrea\r\nwas driven out of the biggest chunk of Ethiopian territory\r\nthat it had occupied by force. No organization or third\r\nparty has ever called upon Ethiopia to vacate or withdraw\r\nfrom Eritrean territory, because we have never been there.\r\nIn fact, on the contrary, the OAU has always called for\r\nEritrean troops to be redeployed from Ethiopian territory.\r\nNo document exists calling upon us to withdraw from\r\nEritrean territory, because we never invaded Eritrea or\r\ncommitted aggression against Eritrea.\r\nWhen they say they left Ethiopian territory in the\r\ninterests of a peaceful resolution of the dispute, that is\r\nwhere they underestimate the international community to\r\nthe point of insulting its intelligence, as I said. That is\r\noutrageous. They claim they left not because they were\r\nevicted, but in the interests of peace. That is an insult to\r\nthe OAU, never mind the rest of the international\r\ncommunity. Eritrea\u0027s current posture of peace is no more\r\nthan a veneer — it is a sham, which will be easily\r\nexposed. A veneer is a thin layer; it is a superficial or\r\nmeretricious show; it is a gloss. Once the surface is\r\nscratched, the real thing appears. It gives an attractive\r\nsurface appearance, concealing in particular defects of\r\n41\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\ncharacter, under a very superficial and specious\r\nattractiveness.\r\nThe posture we see displayed by Eritrea is a veneer.\r\nHow do we scratch the veneer? We do so by revealing\r\nEritrea\u0027s current destabilizing conduct in the Horn, while it\r\nis calling for peace with Ethiopia. Last week, the President\r\nof a State in the Horn of Africa clearly expressed the\r\nsincere belief that Eritrea would gain more as an equal\r\npartner in the collective regional effort to fashion\r\ncomprehensive peace, augment development and address\r\nthe challenges of environmental degradation than it would\r\nby pursuing a senseless and reckless policy of confrontation\r\nand destabilization. We did not say that; the President of\r\nthe Republic of Djibouti said it from this very rostrum.\r\nDjibouti was, and still is, one of the victims of Eritrea\u0027s\r\npolicy of destabilization.\r\nThe destabilizing conduct removes the veneer and\r\nexposes the real Eritrea, as I have said. In the final\r\nanalysis, the question is one of trust — of trusting an\r\naggressor. Obviously, a victim such as Ethiopia, in\r\nparticular, cannot afford to trust the aggressor. Other States,\r\nwhich are not victims, might trust aggressors. They can\r\nafford to do so, because their land is not occupied. But we\r\nhave to ensure that, however shrill Eritrea\u0027s profession of\r\npeace may be, no loophole remains that would allow the\r\naggressor to take advantage. All we are saying is that there\r\nshould be no departure from the basic — I repeat: the\r\nbasic — OAU document, namely, the framework\r\nagreement. Eritrea\u0027s so-called acceptance of the framework\r\nagreement cannot be rewarded by departures from the basic\r\ndocument in subsequent implementing documents. No\r\nincentives should be provided to the aggressors to accept\r\nsomething which they should accept. Erosion of the\r\nfundamental principles of the framework agreement would\r\nbe no less than appeasement.\r\nMr. Jordán-Pando (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nshould like to refer to the comments made by the\r\nAmbassador of Chile earlier today.\r\nI was surprised that Chile exercised its right of\r\nreply with reference to the comments made by the Foreign\r\nMinister of Bolivia this morning, although I have no\r\nobjection to its doing so. Representatives have the text of\r\nthe statement of the Bolivian Foreign Minister and heard\r\nhim speak; they know, that his statement was constructive\r\nand positive. Furthermore, it is consistent with Ambassador\r\nLarraín\u0027s appeal for a dialogue without conditions. The\r\nForeign Minister of Bolivia said that Bolivia is determined\r\nto call for a direct dialogue that would cover all issues\r\nrelating to our relations with Chile, without conditions. In\r\nthe past, it has been a condition of such a dialogue that\r\nthe issue of access to the sea should not be discussed.\r\nFurthermore, later in his statement, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Bolivia said:\r\n“I trust that very soon we will define, with\r\nChancellor Valdés, the terms of that dialogue,\r\nwhich, in my opinion, should encompass the\r\ncomplete range of our relations and identify ways\r\nfor the economic, cultural and political cooperation\r\nwhich will unite our nations”. (A/54/PV.20)\r\nSo I believe we are in agreement. I welcome that\r\nagreement and believe that we must look forward to such\r\na dialogue and inform the international community that\r\nthese initial efforts will lead to a future dialogue between\r\nthe Foreign Ministries of Bolivia and Chile.\r\nAs to the other comment, that there are no pending\r\nissues between us, we have been hearing it for 120 years;\r\nand Bolivia has been responding for 120 years. But I will\r\nnot dwell on this, because I would then have to go in\r\ndetail into the 1904 treaty by which Bolivia became a\r\nlandlocked country. Let us look at positive elements and\r\nleave that situation for future discussion.\r\nOn more than eight occasions there has been\r\ndialogue with Chile, five of them in this century;\r\nunfortunately, for many reasons that I need not go into\r\nnow, these talks have been unsuccessful. The fact that we\r\nhave attempted negotiations on five occasions means that\r\nsomething is pending. But let us not get into a back-and-\r\nforth about this; I merely wanted to cite the comments of\r\nthe representative of Chile and to note that they are in full\r\nagreement with the statement made this morning by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Bolivia on the need for\r\ndirect dialogue on all the various issues with Chile, which\r\nwill be defined by the Foreign Ministers of our two\r\ncountries, Mr. Javier Murillo of Bolivia and Mr. Juan\r\nGabriel Valdés of Chile.\r\nMr. Menkerios (Eritrea): I do not want to belabour\r\nthe point, but want only to say that war, whether waged\r\nby fighting or by words, as it is here, is not going to get\r\nus nearer to a peaceful resolution of a border conflict that\r\ncan and must be resolved peacefully. I think that what is\r\nmost important at the end of the day is that there is a\r\nproposal that has been considered fair and just by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), by the Security\r\nCouncil and by the international community at large.\r\n42\r\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 1 October 1999\r\nEritrea has made concessions, and it has accepted all these\r\nproposals. We did not draft the proposals; the OAU, in\r\ncollaboration with the United Nations and the United States,\r\ndid so. We have accepted them as a basis for a peaceful\r\nsolution. It remains up to the Ethiopians to accept them,\r\nrather than offering arguments about why they are not\r\naccepting them now. Then we can go on and resolve this\r\npeacefully.\r\nIf they reject them, they are not rejecting Eritrea’s\r\nproposals, because Eritrea did not draft those proposals.\r\nThey are rejecting the proposals of the OAU and the whole\r\ninternational community; they will have to deal with that.\r\nMr. Gold (Israel): I wish only to reiterate the\r\ndetermination of the people of Israel to reach peace with all\r\nof Israel’s neighbours, including peace with Syria. This is\r\na commonly held wish and hope of all the people of Israel,\r\nto lead to a peace which will make Israel more secure\r\ntomorrow, not less secure. But what is required right now\r\nis to reiterate the clarification that I made yesterday in the\r\nname of the Government of Israel: that no commitment was\r\nprovided in past negotiations to return specifically to a line\r\nof 4 June 1967, and that the basis of negotiations, as is well\r\nknown by all States members of this body, is Security\r\nCouncil resolution 242 (1967) and the subsequent Council\r\nresolution 338 (1973). These have formed the basis of our\r\nnegotiations since the time of the Madrid peace process.\r\nThe notion that no commitment was provided during\r\n1994 or 1993, when we had an earlier Israeli-Syrian\r\nnegotiation, is not only the policy that I stated just\r\nyesterday, but has been documented by those who were\r\ninvolved in those negotiations and who have written on\r\nthem since, including our head negotiator in 1994, Israel’s\r\nthen Ambassador to the United States, Itamar Rabinovich.\r\nI think, rather than take selected portions of the\r\nnegotiating record and try and turn them into binding\r\nagreements that never existed, that were never signed,\r\nwhat it is necessary for the parties to do now to finally\r\nput an end to the Arab-Israel conflict in the year ahead is\r\nfor Israel and Syria to meet face to face and settle these\r\nissues once and for all. We should remember that during\r\nthose previous negotiations the parties were guided by a\r\nprinciple: nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\r\nAnd if we sit together, face to face, the people of Israel\r\nand the Government of Israel are determined to reach\r\npeace with Syria, not in five years, not in three years, but\r\nthis year. So let us sit down and get the negotiations\r\nunder way.\r\nMr. Yemer (Ethiopia): The statement just made by\r\nthe representative of Eritrea does not impel me to say\r\nanything new vis-à-vis what I said in my earlier\r\nstatement. I have said enough about Eritrea’s professions\r\nof peace, its sudden change of heart, its 180-degree turn;\r\nI have described Eritrea as an aggressor. I do not want to\r\nbelabour the point now.\r\nI would like to say for the record, in response to his\r\nstatement, that I stand by every word of my previous\r\nstatement.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8 p.m.\r\n43\r\n"
