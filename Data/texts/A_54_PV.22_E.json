(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I first give the floor to the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister of Swaziland, His Excellency Mr. Arthur\r\nKhoza.\r\nMr. Khoza (Swaziland): I am honoured to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth session as a\r\nrepresentative of His Majesty the King of Swaziland. I\r\nbring with me from the Kingdom of Swaziland warmest\r\ngreetings and best wishes to all our fellow members from\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi,\r\nthe Government and the whole Swazi nation.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland congratulates you, Sir, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nthis session. We are especially proud that a fellow southern\r\nAfrican has been elected to this demanding position, and\r\nwe are confident that your diplomatic skills and experience\r\nwill help you guide and lead this Assembly towards the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of its deliberations.\r\nWe should also like to commend the skilful leadership\r\nof the fifty-third session by your predecessor Mr. Didier\r\nOpertti.\r\nWe are meeting at a time of great challenges for the\r\nUnited Nations. The membership is faced with a number of\r\nissues concerning the very shape of our Organization and\r\nthe scope of operations that we choose to undertake. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland believes that we are fortunate\r\nindeed to have at this time a Secretary-General who\r\ncommands such universal respect and who possesses the\r\nqualities of determination, enthusiasm and leadership that\r\nare so necessary as we chart our course for the future. We\r\ncall on him and on the staff of the United Nations to keep\r\nup their good work in the service of all Member States.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff can best be supported by\r\nour continuing commitment to meeting our financial\r\nobligations in full and on time. We call on all our fellow\r\nMembers to comply by honouring their obligations so that\r\nour Organization can have sufficient resources with which\r\nto cope with the widening scope of its operations and to\r\nmeet the expectations of us all.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland is delighted to extend a\r\nwarm welcome to our Organization’s three new Members:\r\nthe nation States of Tonga, Nauru and Kiribati. Their\r\nadmission is further confirmation of our respect for the\r\nprinciples of universality and representation, as contained\r\nin the founding Charter of the United Nations.\r\nBut even as we welcome these new Members, the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland is conscious that the principle of\r\nuniversality is not applied equally to others who feel\r\nexcluded from the activities of our Organization. I refer\r\nto the 22 million people of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan, who believe that they are being denied their right\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nto representation in the United Nations. The Government\r\nand the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan have\r\nshown their willingness and capacity to contribute actively\r\nto global development and peace, through disaster relief and\r\ndevelopment support to many countries and regions. The\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan is clearly a peace-loving\r\nnation, and is highly developed in all economic, social and\r\npolitical spheres.\r\nIt is the view of the Kingdom of Swaziland that\r\ninternational peace and security and equitable development\r\nfor all mankind, can be achieved only through the inclusion\r\nof all the people of the world in the one truly global\r\ndevelopment Organization. We therefore support the call\r\nfrom an increasing number of Member States for the\r\nestablishment of a working group by the General Assembly\r\nto examine the exceptional international situation relating to\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan and to ensure that the\r\nfundamental right of its 22 million people to participate in\r\nthe work and activities of the United Nations is fully\r\nrespected. We recognize that, as has been the case in some\r\nother nations, the matter of reunification is for the Chinese\r\npeople themselves.\r\nThe history of the twentieth century will have further\r\nevidence to support the belief that man apparently and\r\nsurprisingly cannot live peacefully side by side with his\r\nneighbour, nor in harmony with nature and his environment.\r\nDespite the many remarkable achievements of the last 99\r\nyears, notably in the collapse of ideological and political\r\ncolonialism and in the fields of technology, science and\r\nmedicine, it will be, in the end, by world wars,\r\nenvironmental degradation and the emergence of global\r\nepidemics that this century will be remembered.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\r\npromotion of sustainable international peace and security\r\nmust be the main priority for the United Nations, because\r\nit is clear that our collective aim of raising the living\r\nstandards of our peoples is possible only in conditions of\r\nglobal stability and with nations living in harmony\r\nalongside one another.\r\nIt has long been recognized that the greatest threat to\r\nglobal peace lies in the continuing spread of weapons of\r\nmass destruction. Our failure so far as an Organization to\r\nhave true commitment from all Members to arms control\r\nand nuclear disarmament has meant that we enter the next\r\nmillennium with this threat still overshadowing all matters\r\nof international relations.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty are designed as essential first steps towards a\r\nworld free from the danger that such weapons pose. We\r\nclearly need to find a way to strengthen the\r\nnon-proliferation regime, and also to prevent the flow of\r\nconventional weapons and anti-personnel landmines into\r\nzones of conflict.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore calls upon the\r\nConference on Disarmament to implement the proposal of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement by establishing as its highest\r\npriority an ad hoc committee to begin negotiations on a\r\nprogramme for the complete elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons, within a time-bound framework. We also urge\r\nthose States with nuclear weapons to implement faithfully\r\nboth the letter and spirit of all agreements relating to the\r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nWhilst the possibilities of global conflict have\r\ndiminished since the end of the cold-war era, it is a fact\r\nthat there has been a corresponding increase in the\r\nincidence of internal conflicts and cross-border\r\ndisturbances arising from a variety of causes, including\r\nethnic and religious confrontation. The Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland believes that the emphasis of the United\r\nNations in dealing with this increase of internal and\r\ncross-border crises should be on the introduction of an\r\neffective mechanism of preventive diplomacy to stop\r\nincidents from escalating out of control. This has been the\r\nfocus of regional organizations of which the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland is a member, such as the Common Market for\r\nEastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). We believe that,\r\nwhile recognizing the overall responsibility of the United\r\nNations towards global peace, the regional organizations\r\nmust take the lead as the building blocks towards stability\r\nand closer cooperation.\r\nThe past year in international affairs has been a mix\r\nof progress in some areas of past conflict and the\r\ncontinuation or emergence of crises in many others. The\r\nUnited Nations has quite correctly become involved in\r\ntrying to help resolve each of these situations, to a greater\r\nor lesser degree, and the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\ncommends its efforts and those of all who have played a\r\nsimilar role.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland recognizes the recent\r\nprogress made by Israelis and Palestinians towards the\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nimplementation of the Wye River peace accord. This has\r\nbeen a most encouraging step towards lasting peace in the\r\nMiddle East region and we applaud the courage and\r\ncommitment of the leadership of both sides towards\r\nachieving this aim.\r\nThe crisis in the former Yugoslavia earlier this year\r\ngave us cause for great concern, especially in the light of\r\nthe threat of the conflict’s spreading to other Balkan States.\r\nWe pray that the recent return to relative stability will lead\r\nto lasting peace in that troubled region and that the wishes\r\nof the people for their future will be the guiding principle\r\nin any long-term dispensation.\r\nWe have viewed with concern the events in East\r\nTimor following the referendum on independence and we\r\nfully support the decision of the United Nations to accede\r\nto the request of the Indonesian Government for the urgent\r\ndeployment of a peacekeeping force. We appeal to all\r\ninvolved to restore calm to the situation and to respect the\r\nwishes of the people of East Timor for their future.\r\nWe have watched with equal concern the apparent\r\nsetback in the peace process in Northern Ireland. We\r\nsupport the efforts of the British and Irish Governments to\r\ncreate the right conditions of trust and confidence, in which\r\nthe people of Northern Ireland can decide their future for\r\nthemselves. We urge all parties involved to exercise\r\nrestraint and to rediscover the spirit of compromise and\r\nreconciliation that characterized the original Good Friday\r\nAgreement.\r\nCloser to home, on our own continent of Africa, the\r\npast year has given cause for some optimism in a number\r\nof areas; but in others, the tale is all too depressingly\r\nfamiliar.\r\nWe welcome with great relief the signing of the Peace\r\nAgreement between the warring factions in Sierra Leone\r\nand we appeal to both sides to abide by the terms of the\r\nsettlement so that their people may benefit from the\r\ndividend of peace after so many years of suffering and lack\r\nof development.\r\nThe continuing border dispute between Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea has unsettled all in the Horn of Africa and we\r\napplaud the decision of both countries to agree to mediation\r\nefforts between them by the United Nations and the OAU.\r\nWe pray that this sensible move may lead to a peaceful\r\nsettlement of the crisis.\r\nThe recent signing of an Agreement by all parties to\r\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has\r\nencouraged all of us in the region. We hope that there\r\nwill be commitment by all signatories to the terms of the\r\nceasefire and that a lasting solution may be found that\r\nwill allow the Congolese people to develop their great\r\npotential in peace. This last success is all the more\r\nencouraging for those of us in the SADC region, since it\r\ncame about through the combined efforts of a number of\r\nSADC member States. In a similar vein, heightened\r\ntension between two of our members, Angola and\r\nZambia, was able to be defused before the situation could\r\nescalate into a crisis.\r\nBoth of these situations point to the acceptance of\r\nresponsibility by our member States for resolving regional\r\ndifficulties ourselves. Of course, this does not preclude\r\nour welcome to the willingness of others, such as the\r\nOAU, the United Nations and individual countries that\r\nwish to be involved, especially in the provision of training\r\nand material and financial support. But we firmly believe\r\nin the principle that African problems require african\r\nsolutions and we are determined to come up with the\r\nmeans and mechanisms to abide by it.\r\nOn the negative side, the continent has seen the\r\ncontinuation of two crises that are having an especially\r\ndamaging effect on the lives of the people involved and\r\nthat we believe require the urgent attention of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe first concerns the deteriorating situation in\r\nAngola, where peace remains as elusive as ever. We call\r\non the leadership of UNITA to respect the terms of the\r\nLusaka Protocol and to recognize the need to use it as the\r\nstarting point in the search for lasting peace and national\r\nhealing. We appeal to the international community to\r\ncontinue to support the efforts of SADC and all of us\r\nwho are involved in the quest for an end to the suffering\r\nof the Angolan people.\r\nThe situation is Somalia, while possessing different\r\ncharacteristics, has the same distressing effect on the\r\npeople of that unfortunate country. The fact is that the\r\ndivision and lack of any legitimate central authority in\r\ntheir country has deprived Somalis not only of peace and\r\nthe chance for development, but also of a voice of appeal\r\nin regional and international forums.\r\nThe time has surely come for the United Nations to\r\nshow real commitment to finding a solution to the\r\nSomalia crisis, in the same way that we are expending a\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\ngreat deal of effort and resources in crisis situations in\r\nother parts of the world. The Somali people deserve the\r\nsame concern and respect for their future from the rest of\r\nthe world as those in countries with perhaps greater global\r\nrecognition and resources.\r\nThe complex challenges facing the world today lend\r\ngreater significance and urgency to the initiatives for reform\r\nof our Organization. The Kingdom of Swaziland believes\r\nthat these reforms are essential if the United Nations is to\r\nretain the global credibility and authority that are so\r\nnecessary in its operations.\r\nRecent history has shown clearly that the traditional\r\nmechanisms for harmonizing global relations and conflict\r\nresolution, in particular, are no longer effective, and the\r\nUnited Nations is in real danger of losing the confidence of\r\nits Members in these areas.\r\nOur aim must be to transform our Organization into a\r\nstructure that is truly representative of all our Members and\r\nthat is transparent and efficient in its operations, while\r\nremaining consistent to the purposes and principles of our\r\nfounding Charter.\r\nWe believe that the priority should be to achieve\r\nbalanced representation in the principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations. The Security Council, as a particular\r\nexample, requires reform in order to strengthen its\r\nlegitimacy. Its composition must reflect the plurality and\r\ndiversity of the membership of the United Nations, with\r\ndue regard for the profound geopolitical changes in recent\r\nhistory.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland reaffirms its full support\r\nfor the African position on reform of the Security Council,\r\nnamely, two permanent seats for Africa to be shared on a\r\nrotational basis, as well as three non-permanent seats, and\r\na re-examination of the exercise of veto power.\r\nIt is a fact that the majority of Member States concur\r\nwith this need for reform of the Security Council and that\r\nall agree on the urgency attached to the matter. Yet there\r\nhas been very little progress made so far by the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group established to address this vital\r\nissue. We are concerned at this lack of progress and would\r\nurge the Working Group to overcome whatever obstacles\r\nremain to a resolution that meets Members’ demands for\r\nfairness and urgency.\r\nTurning now to the question of the Millennium\r\nAssembly, to be convened next year, the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland is encouraged by the emerging consensus\r\namong Member States on the need to articulate a vision\r\nfor the international community in the year 2000.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s theme of the\r\nUnited Nations in the twenty-first century and the\r\nproposed sub-topics for the Millennium Assembly. Of\r\nthese, we believe the closely related sub-topics of peace\r\nand security, on the one hand, and development and\r\npoverty eradication, on the other, to be of the highest\r\npriority in the context of the overall theme.\r\nFuture global stability depends on the ability of\r\nnational Governments to increase the momentum for\r\neconomic development and their capacity to improve the\r\ndelivery of job creation and essential social services, such\r\nas health and education.\r\nWe believe that poverty eradication can be achieved\r\nonly through the promotion of an accelerated pace of\r\ngrowth and development in the developing countries.\r\nThere can be no doubt that, to achieve this aim, we need\r\nthe support of the rest of the international community,\r\nand this support can best be coordinated by the United\r\nNations.\r\nOne key factor in the achievement of our aim of\r\npoverty eradication is the concept of the globalization and\r\nliberalization of the global economy. The conclusion of\r\nthe Uruguay Round, on the one hand, promised to open\r\nup enormous trade opportunities in the sale and\r\nmovement of goods and services, but on the other it\r\nthreatened the fragile economies of those countries that\r\nhad not achieved the state of preparation to take full\r\nadvantage.\r\nThe continent of Africa, in particular, continues to\r\nface a multitude of problems as we struggle to settle into\r\nthe new world order. Many of us are undertaking painful\r\nreforms of existing structures in order to respond to the\r\ndemands of globalization and liberalization. The\r\nimplementation of structural adjustment programmes,\r\noften on the instructions of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, is having a severely adverse impact on the\r\nsocial welfare of many African countries, with devastating\r\neffects on the quality of life of our people. We can see\r\nthe result of these effects in many countries, where a\r\ndecrease in expenditure on social programmes has led to\r\nheightened internal tension and instability.\r\nClearly, globalization and liberalization as concepts\r\nhave much to recommend them. Undoubtedly, they hold\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nthe key to an economic future of equal opportunity for all\r\ncountries. But we are saying that they need to take into\r\naccount the unequal starting points of each country: that\r\nsome are better prepared than others to take full advantage\r\nof the opportunities they offer and that many of us may\r\nwell lose any hope of catching up. We are seeing the very\r\nsovereignty of countries being eroded by the power of\r\nmultinational companies. True economic power is being\r\nheld in fewer and fewer hands, and the developing\r\ncountries are becoming further marginalized. Social\r\nproblems increase as people lose jobs and capital and\r\ncurrency values are controlled elsewhere.\r\nThe developing countries cannot wish away\r\nglobalization, but we would wish it to adopt a more human\r\nface, one that recognizes and makes allowances for the\r\nfundamental inequalities between the richer and the poorer\r\nnations of the world and makes concessions to allow us the\r\nopportunity to take full advantage of its opportunities in due\r\ncourse.\r\nFor our part in the Kingdom of Swaziland, we are\r\naggressively pursuing political, economic, social and\r\ninstitutional reforms that will have a major impact on all\r\naspects of national life, in accordance with the wishes and\r\nexpectations of the Swazi people themselves.\r\nThis year, we launched the national development\r\nstrategy, a people-driven vision for the long term, providing\r\na planning framework for government action priorities for\r\nthe next 25 years. The core aim of the strategy is to achieve\r\na sustainable increase in the standard of living of all\r\nSwazis, with particular emphasis on eliminating poverty\r\nfrom our society. Our priority is to create the conditions for\r\na vibrant economy and to increase our capacity to provide\r\nour people with a high level of human development.\r\nThis long-term blueprint has been used as the basis for\r\ntwo short- and medium-term programmes of action by the\r\nGovernment that are linked to timetables and are fully\r\naccountable for results.\r\nThe economic and social reform agenda is a\r\nperformance management tool that identifies priority actions\r\nand keeps government performance under close, public\r\nscrutiny and the public sector management programme\r\ndesigned to improve service delivery and cost-effectiveness\r\nin the public sector. We believe that these initiatives, with\r\nthe wishes of the people at their heart, will provide us with\r\nthe right conditions in which to prosper and to achieve our\r\nhuman development objectives.\r\nWe have very much appreciated the support of the\r\nUnited Nations in formulating the strategy. The national\r\ndevelopment strategy should, from now on, form the\r\npriority target for all development support from United\r\nNations agencies. We would wish the same from the\r\ninternational development finance institutions. We share\r\nthe concern of many fellow Member States in the\r\ndeveloping world that too often these institutions’ target\r\nfor support is not in tune with the wishes of the country\r\ninvolved and that the process of project design and\r\napproval is painfully slow. We look forward to working\r\nwith the United Nations Development Programme and the\r\ninternational finance institutions to design projects that\r\ncoincide with the wishes of our own people, and within\r\na time-frame that meets our expectations of speedy\r\nimplementation.\r\nIn 1996, the Kingdom of Swaziland embarked on a\r\nreview of its Constitution with the establishment of a\r\ncommission that was tasked with collecting the views of\r\nall Swazis on all aspects of the present Constitution. We\r\nhave kept the General Assembly fully informed on the\r\nprogress of this commission each year, and I am delighted\r\nto report that the people’s recommendations on the\r\nConstitution will be presented to the nation at the end of\r\nthis year. The process will then move forward to the\r\ndrafting of these recommendations into a formal\r\ndocument that will be confirmed by the people\r\nthemselves, before final ratification.\r\nThroughout the process of constitutional review, we\r\nhave been guided by the principle of involving all Swazis\r\nin the drafting of what will be the Kingdom’s defining\r\ndocument. Consultation with our people on all important\r\nmatters is a principle that we have followed throughout\r\nour history, and is one that has helped us to maintain the\r\npeace and stability with which we have always been\r\nblessed.\r\nI have spoken at length about the efforts we in the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland are making to improve the lives\r\nof our people. And yet, all our plans and all our good\r\nintentions are meaningless in the face of the danger that\r\nthreatens to overwhelm our nation. I am referring, of\r\ncourse, to the HIV/AIDS crisis, which is already having\r\na severe impact on the lives of many Swazi families and\r\nwhich undermines all our hopes for a future of prosperity\r\nand security for all our people. We are facing up to the\r\nfact that the Kingdom of Swaziland has one of the highest\r\nrates of HIV infection in the world, and our hospitals and\r\nclinics are stretched to the limit of capacity as a result.\r\nWe are making every effort to halt the spread of the\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\ndeadly disease. But it is an uphill struggle and involves us\r\nin bringing about a wholesale change in attitude and moral\r\nbehaviour.\r\nOur chief concern is to promote awareness of the\r\ndanger and of the preventive measures available. Our\r\nresources are limited, and we need the continuing support\r\nof the international community in our efforts to reverse the\r\ndownward trend. This appeal was repeatedly made at the\r\nrecent Eleventh International Conference on AIDS and\r\nSTDs in Africa held in Lusaka. We therefore join other\r\nMember States in a similar predicament in appealing to the\r\nUnited Nations to coordinate an international response to\r\nthe crisis. The very future of our nation, and that of many\r\nothers, depends on those with the technical and financial\r\nresources joining forces with us to stem the deadly tide.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress the deep gratitude of Their Majesties, the\r\nGovernment and the whole Swazi nation, to the United\r\nNations Development Programme and all its sister agencies,\r\nfor the many programmes of assistance undertaken in the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland since our independence.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations, as the one truly\r\nglobal development Organization, remains the only hope for\r\novercoming the many complex challenges facing the world\r\ntoday. Despite the setbacks and obstacles to achieving our\r\ncollective aims, there can be no doubt that the world would\r\nbe a more troubled place without the combined efforts of\r\nall of us here.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore takes great pride\r\nin reaffirming its commitment to the principles and ideals\r\ncontained in the United Nations Charter, and we ask\r\nAlmighty God to watch over and guide us in the\r\nchallenging times ahead for our Organization.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Trinidad and Tobago, His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Ralph Maraj.\r\nMr. Maraj (Trinidad and Tobago): I wish to\r\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its final session of the twentieth\r\ncentury and would like to assure you of the fullest\r\ncooperation of the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago as\r\nyou discharge the duties entrusted to you by the Member\r\nStates of the United Nations. We would also like to\r\ncommend your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay,\r\nfor the very capable and distinguished manner in which he\r\nguided the Assembly’s work during its fifty-third session.\r\nThere is only one real purpose to government. It is\r\nto serve the people, to protect them and to improve the\r\nquality of their lives. In their enlightened self-interest,\r\nnations also come together to serve that end by trying to\r\ncreate a better world, one in which their own citizens can\r\ninteract with others and benefit from relationships in the\r\npursuit of their fulfilment. At both the national and global\r\nlevels, the human being is supposed to be at the centre of\r\nthe purpose, processes and policies of governance. It is\r\nthe foundation of democratic civilization to create the\r\nconditions that give the individual the opportunity for\r\nfulfilment.\r\nWe need to assess our nations and our world in the\r\nlight of that original intention as we approach the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe present global picture proves that much went\r\nwrong during this century. The economic models of the\r\ncentury have failed to create economic and social justice.\r\nThe central planning of Communism was disastrous,\r\nsuffocating human development by stifling initiatives and\r\nfreedoms and creating oppressive authoritarian regimes.\r\nThe Big Government of the centre-left era was bungling\r\nand bureaucratic, killing entrepreneurial initiative and\r\ngenerating a dependency syndrome, and was imperfect in\r\nits delivery as the major social and economic actor. Now\r\nwe are in the era of the market, of deregulation and\r\nborderlessness, and the question still is: what have we\r\nachieved?\r\nAt the turn of the century, we have 1.3 billion\r\npeople in the category of the poor, earning less than $1\r\ndollar per day. More than 880 million people lack access\r\nto health services, 2.6 billion people lack access to basic\r\nsanitation and 1.5 billion people are not expected to\r\nsurvive to age 60. The number of malnourished is 840\r\nmillion people, nearly 20 per cent of whom are children.\r\nOne of the most tragic situations as we approach the end\r\nof the century is that 70 per cent of the world’s poor are\r\nwomen. From 1990 to 1997 the number of people\r\ninfected with HIV/AIDS more than doubled, with the\r\nmajority of victims in the developing world.\r\nIronically, in this much-heralded information age, 75\r\nmillion people are estimated to be illiterate, with the\r\nmajority also in the developing world. In addition to the\r\nproblem of illiteracy, the education system in most\r\ndeveloping countries is producing unskilled and\r\nunemployable young people.\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nFive billion of the world\u0027s 6 billion people live in the\r\ndeveloping world, but most of the resources are\r\nconcentrated in the developed countries. Twenty per cent of\r\nthe world\u0027s richest countries share 86 per cent of the world\u0027s\r\ngross domestic product, 82 per cent of exports of goods and\r\nservices and 68 per cent of foreign direct investment.\r\nIf there is any demonstration of the inequality that\r\nexists and how most human beings have been marginalized\r\nas we approach the end of the twentieth century, the\r\nfollowing is a striking example: the assets of the three\r\nrichest people are more than the combined gross national\r\nproduct of all of the least developed countries; the assets of\r\nthe 200 richest people are more than the combined income\r\nof 41 per cent of the world\u0027s people; and a yearly\r\ncontribution of 1 per cent of the wealth of the 200 richest\r\npeople could provide universal access to primary education\r\nfor all.\r\nThere is an even darker side to the picture. As we\r\nspan the far reaches of history, and especially in this\r\ncentury, we see that very often the individual in society has\r\nbeen the victim of political and economic forces beyond his\r\ncontrol. He has suffered the horrendous consequences of\r\nethnic, cultural and religious intolerance. It is the individual\r\nand the family that have suffered the most from the\r\ndevastating effects of wars, genocide and ethnic cleansing.\r\nIn our century alone, we have witnessed the tragedy\r\nof two world wars, which have resulted in the loss of a\r\ncountless number of lives, the separation of families and the\r\nloss of hope for many. We have seen the untold human\r\nmisery and pain of the Holocaust, the injustices and\r\nsuffering of apartheid and the callousness of regimes which\r\nhave unleashed acts of unspeakable horror on their citizens.\r\nThroughout this century, we have been shocked by news\r\nand television images of the harsh realities endured by the\r\nvictims of such horrors in Europe, Cambodia, Rwanda,\r\nBosnia and the former Yugoslavia, to name a few. And,\r\nsadly, we have realized that the very scientific and\r\ntechnological advances which were intended for the service\r\nof humanity can be turned to evil ends in the service of the\r\ndestruction of humanity.\r\nNevertheless, in the midst of one of the darkest\r\nchapters of the twentieth century, there is hope in the fact\r\nthat such evils have stirred the conscience of the\r\ninternational community to strengthen the rule of law, to\r\naddress situations such as these and to ensure respect for\r\nfundamental human rights.\r\nIt is because of this recognition that we have today\r\nthe most recent instrument, the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. This Statute is the result of\r\na call made in 1989 by Mr. Arthur N.R. Robinson,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, for the\r\ninternational community to renew its focus on the\r\nquestion of the establishment of an international criminal\r\njurisdiction to deal with these atrocities, and also with\r\ncrimes associated with the illicit drug trade, all of which\r\nhave such a heavy impact on a Government\u0027s ability to\r\naddress the fundamental needs of its citizens.\r\nIn addition to the establishment of the International\r\nCriminal Court, there is hope in the fact that the United\r\nNations has made advances in the area of human rights.\r\nWe have seen the adoption of several instruments, such\r\nas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the\r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\r\nwhich guarantee fundamental human rights, the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on\r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen and the International Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. These\r\nreflect the commitments and obligations of the\r\ninternational community to improving the quality of life\r\nof the individual in the various sectors of society. But we\r\nmust not pay lip-service to the principles enshrined in the\r\ninternational instruments that we have adopted; there is\r\ntoo much of a trend of paying lip-service. We need to\r\ntake concrete action now.\r\nAlbert Camus, one of the distinguished writers of\r\nmodern times noted that,\r\n“Probably every generation sees itself as charged\r\nwith remaking the world. Mine, however, knows that\r\nits task will not be merely to remake the world. Its\r\ntask is even greater: to keep the world from\r\ndestroying itself.”\r\nThere is no doubt that the task in the new century is\r\nto save the world from self-destruction, and the question\r\nis, what type of economic arrangement will ensure that\r\nsalvation? Surely it cannot be one in which the few feast\r\nat the table, leaving mere crumbs for the majority. No one\r\ncan be insulated from the catastrophe inherent in such a\r\nsituation. Disease, terrorism, the drug trade, human\r\nenslavement, child labour and ecological disaster will\r\ncontinue to be produced by a world bereft of economic\r\nand social justice. No fortress, whether economic or\r\nmilitary, will be strong enough to insulate any country\r\nfrom the effects of such a situation. Some may not like it,\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nand some tend to forget it; but it is one world that we live\r\nin, one globe that we share. We should take a lesson from\r\nnature itself, whose hot winds emanate from the Sahara in\r\nAfrica, become hurricanes in their journey across the\r\nAtlantic and eventually devastate and desolate countries as\r\nfar away as the Caribbean and North, Central and South\r\nAmerica.\r\nIn this era of globalization, we have excellent\r\nopportunities to put in place new and innovative global\r\nstructures that would make possible global solutions to\r\nensure the social, economic and cultural security of the\r\nindividual. The World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting\r\nin Seattle this year, the South Summit, the special sessions\r\nof the General Assembly to follow up of the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development and the Fourth World Conference\r\non Women and, indeed, the Millennium Assembly next\r\nyear, provide ideal opportunities for the international\r\ncommunity to respond to this coming crisis of mankind.\r\nIn the upcoming WTO Seattle meeting, it must be\r\nrecognized that many of the measures which were supposed\r\nto be put in place in the new global trading system ushered\r\nin by the Uruguay Round have not been realized. Giving\r\neffect to those matters must therefore be the priority in any\r\nnew round of WTO negotiations. In other words,\r\nimplementation of commitments already made must be the\r\nemphasis.\r\nIn that process, we must recognize that a special\r\ncategory of States face peculiar disadvantages arising from\r\nthe policy actions of the international community. These are\r\nthe small and vulnerable States, of which the States of the\r\nCaribbean region make up a significant part. For these\r\ncountries, the need to maintain the provisions for special\r\nand differential treatment in the present WTO Agreement\r\nis fundamental.\r\nThe liberalization of international trade under the\r\nWTO is a dynamic force for accelerating growth and\r\ndevelopment. The challenge for the next Ministerial\r\nConference is to ensure resolute progress towards an open,\r\nfree and fair international trading system in which benefits\r\nare equitably distributed. Developed countries must\r\ndemonstrate an unequivocal commitment to opening their\r\nmarkets to exports of developing countries to enable them\r\nto achieve sustained levels of economic development. The\r\ndisconnection between developments in the WTO and the\r\ndevelopment process at the national level in developing\r\ncountries must be arrested. The rules-based system of the\r\nWTO, which aims to promote free and fair trade, must do\r\njust that. The idea of the level playing field, we must\r\nremember, is a dangerous myth, and if it is allowed to\r\nhold sway it will further the pauperization of hundreds of\r\nmillions of people all over the world.\r\nPolicies developed and promoted by international\r\nfinancial and monetary institutions such as the World\r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must\r\nhave as their ultimate goal the transformation of societies\r\naimed at achieving a higher degree of social equity and\r\njustice within the global economy. The World Bank and\r\nthe IMF must apply a set of criteria broader than per\r\ncapita income when considering finance and development\r\nassistance, in view of our susceptibility to external\r\neconomic shocks and natural disasters.\r\nWe are heartened by the highly successful\r\nCommonwealth ministerial mission on small island States\r\nundertaken by the Heads of Government in July 1998,\r\nfrom which an agreement has been secured for the\r\nestablishment of a Commonwealth/World Bank task force.\r\nThe World Bank is now developing a strategy, which we\r\nhope will be approved by its board of Executive\r\nDirectors, to reorient its assistance for small States on the\r\nbasis of a strategic assessment of their vulnerability,\r\nconstraints and needs. Other financial institutions and\r\ndevelopment institutions should adopt similar initiatives.\r\nThe governance of the supranational global actors\r\ntherefore has to be reinvented with human development\r\nand equity as imperatives.\r\nA new global partnership of developing countries\r\nmust be forged with the financial institutions and the\r\ndeveloped world to place financing for development on a\r\nsound and predictable level. The economic foundation laid\r\nby the policy prescriptions of structural adjustment\r\nremains questionable in terms of their potential to\r\ngenerate and sustain long-term economic growth. The\r\ninternational financial architecture must therefore be\r\ncompatible with and complementary to real development.\r\nNational Governments cannot be exonerated from\r\ntheir responsibilities. There are too many countries in the\r\nworld whose major problem is the imperfections of their\r\nown Governments. Many who speak about\r\nmarginalization are themselves alienating their own\r\npopulations, and some who lament global poverty are\r\nthemselves pauperizing their own citizens through their\r\nown inadequacies. We cannot call for a reformation\r\nwithout reforming ourselves. Do we all place our people\r\nat the centre of governance? Are we using our resources\r\nwell and for the benefit of our populations who elected us\r\nto serve? We have a responsibility to re-invent our\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\ngovernance at home as part of the global transformation\r\nthat we demand.\r\nThe key question that the Member States of the United\r\nNations face in the twenty-first century is whether the\r\nUnited Nations will become an Organization that can deal\r\neffectively with all forms of injustices to humankind. We\r\nrecall your words, Sir, in your opening statement to the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly:\r\n“The aspirations, hopes and expectations of the\r\nworld\u0027s peoples are high as they anticipate the\r\nfuture. They yearn for a world that is peaceful,\r\nhumane and prosperous for all. Without the United\r\nNations, such an inclusive world, led by i n s p i r i n g\r\nleaders, cannot come about.” (A/54/PV.1)\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is committed to working with\r\nother countries of the world through the United Nations to\r\nfashion a global civilization that would, in the final\r\nanalysis, be its own salvation and protection. We believe\r\nthat the struggle for economic and social justice must start\r\nwith ourselves and that democracy in each country must be\r\nan ever-deepening process which eventually liberates every\r\nsingle individual from want and places him or her in a\r\nposition to pursue his or her own fulfilment while\r\nrespecting the rights of others.\r\nFor us in Trinidad and Tobago everyone matters;\r\nevery life is precious. This is the approach with which we\r\ncome to the United Nations. All nations are important to us\r\nbecause every life in every country is precious. Trinidad\r\nand Tobago believes that the United Nations must come to\r\nunderstand again that it has been made for people — real\r\npeople with flesh and blood and dreams; people who suffer\r\npain and long for joy; people in cars on the street, in\r\nhouses and hovels, in the cold or in sweltering heat,\r\nlabouring in fields or offices, giving birth in hospitals and\r\nelsewhere; real people, Sir, who may never see you in that\r\nchair or me standing here, and if they do see us through the\r\ndistance of television may be surprised and even disbelieve\r\nthat we are doing this for them.\r\nIs it not amazing how ritual and ceremony often\r\nbecome ends in themselves and either replace or obscure\r\nthe real purpose? Trinidad and Tobago is heartened to sense\r\nthat the United Nations is on a path of rediscovery of itself.\r\nIt remains for us the only Organization where every\r\nindividual may be represented and every voice heard, and\r\nwhere every opinion or idea could contend. Trinidad and\r\nTobago pledges to work with others to take this\r\nOrganization back to the people, to ensure that it works\r\namong them, in our collective efforts to save the world.\r\nThe President: Before I give the floor to the next\r\nspeaker, I should like to inform delegations that we still\r\nhave nine speakers remaining on the list for this morning.\r\nMay I therefore again remind speakers that the General\r\nAssembly, in paragraph 21 of the annex to resolution\r\n51/241, has indicated a voluntary guideline of up to 20\r\nminutes for each statement in the general debate. I would\r\nlike to appeal in earnest to speakers to make an extra\r\neffort in observing this 20 minute voluntary guideline so\r\nthat we may conclude our work this morning in good\r\ntime.\r\nI now call on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Afghanistan): Allow me to join the\r\nspeakers preceding me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as the President of the General Assembly at this\r\nsession, the last of the present century. You surely are\r\nwell versed in this high office through your experience\r\nwith the United Nations, which will make of the\r\ncentennial transition the launching platform for ever-\r\nmore-fruitful future undertakings.\r\nAs we embark on the next century, the survival of\r\nthe United Nations as an effective global institution\r\ncomes into question. Can its role develop in the dawn of\r\na new era? Or will it be more like a brilliant sunset?\r\nFrom the League of Nations to the United Nations, we\r\nhave continuously pinned our hopes on the United\r\nNations system, looking forward to a promising world\r\nruled by law, governed by justice and blessed with peace.\r\nHowever, the wide-ranging challenges — from\r\nquestions relating to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the eradication of poverty, sustainable\r\ndevelopment, economic growth and social progress to\r\nglobalization in meaningful terms — all yet to be met and\r\nrequire firm resolve and certainly not mere rhetoric.\r\nAs crises continue to unfold throughout the world,\r\nwe must ask, and answer, certain important questions.\r\nWhy are threats to international peace and security\r\nvariably defined and selectively determined from place to\r\nplace? Why are State violators of the United Nations\r\nCharter and international law, including the principle of\r\nnon-interference, not brought to justice? Why are the\r\ninstigators of “ethnic cleansing” and the perpetrators of\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\ngenocide and of crimes against humanity not checked? Why\r\nis the fight against terrorism and narcotics so limited? And\r\nfinally, where and when will gender apartheid come to an\r\nend?\r\nWe are convinced that those challenges and crises can\r\nbest be dealt with if the United Nations actively functions\r\nwithin a framework similar to that of a state system. In this\r\ncontext, the United Nations Charter serves as an explicit\r\nand clear reference outlining the rights and responsibilities,\r\nin their entirety, of the Member States.\r\nThe advent of the new millennium marks the closing\r\nof the twentieth century. This is a time for the United\r\nNations to pause and assess the gains and losses, and the\r\nsuccesses and setbacks, it has experienced since its\r\nfounding. The United Nations cannot truly embark on the\r\nnext millennium until it has conclusively addressed the\r\nunfinished items on its agenda and the many existing global\r\nthreats. One item on — and perhaps at the top of — that\r\nagenda, though it is far from finalized, relates to Pakistani\r\nhegemonic actions and that country’s collusion with\r\nTalibanism in our region.\r\nThe Pakistani-Taliban occupation of land in\r\nAfghanistan represents a clear breach of a fundamental\r\nprinciple of international law, namely, the inadmissibility of\r\nthe acquisition of territory by force. It is trans-border\r\naggression. In addition, as the report of the Special\r\nRapporteur (E/CN.4/1999/40), states in paragraph 18, the\r\nTaliban\r\n“continue to pursue policies which are in conflict with\r\ninternational human rights standards by which\r\nAfghanistan is bound as a party to the major\r\ninternational human rights instruments.”\r\nFurthermore, the Taliban has committed repeated war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, including forced\r\ndeportation; the forced displacement of hundreds of\r\nthousands of people; the separation of thousands of men\r\nfrom their families; the widespread burning and leveling of\r\nhouses and entire villages; the systematic destruction of the\r\nagricultural base and the irrigation systems, resulting in the\r\nloss of crops due for harvesting; and the execution of a\r\nscorched-earth policy. This has been particularly true, on a\r\nmassive scale, in the Shamali Plains, following the July 19\r\nTashkent meeting of the group of “six plus two”, and just\r\nthis week in Khoja Ghar, in north-eastern Afghanistan.\r\nTheir policies of genocide, gender apartheid, trafficking of\r\nwomen and girls, “ethnic cleansing”, religious and sectarian\r\nextermination, rigid interpretation of religion, and the\r\npursuit of a military solution spell out the Taliban actions\r\nin Afghanistan. They persist in their extremist agenda and\r\nadvocacy of terrorism. The increase in drug production\r\nand trafficking, the Talibanization of the region and their\r\ndenunciation of the international community continue\r\nunabated.\r\nIn sum, over 50 per cent of the Afghan population\r\nhas been placed under virtual house arrest, and the entire\r\npopulation remains terrorized by the Taliban. The\r\ninternational community is greatly disturbed and\r\nconcerned by the ominous nature of the Taliban agenda.\r\nThe responsibility of the much-discussed yet\r\nunresolved turmoil in Afghanistan continues to lie with\r\nthe Pakistani leadership. Pakistan remains a proponent of\r\narm-twisting, both nuclear and conventional, in South\r\nAsia. Afghanistan’s Pakistani-dictated position of\r\nsubordination, through the Taliban, has long undermined\r\nthe peace process. Pakistan remains implacably opposed\r\nto the formation of a fully representative, multi-ethnic\r\ngovernment in Afghanistan, insisting that the Taliban not\r\nrelinquish power but gain further control. To this end,\r\ninter alia, thousands of Pakistani military personnel,\r\nmembers of the paramilitary, former commissioned\r\nofficers and thousands of recruits and “volunteers” from\r\nPakistani religious schools have been trained and\r\ndispatched into Afghanistan for what has been called a\r\n“jihad”.\r\nThe remarks made on 30 July 1999 by Ambassador\r\nLakhdar Brahimi, head of the United Nations Special\r\nMission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), regarding the presence\r\nof thousands of armed Pakistani nationals fighting\r\nalongside the Taliban, provide credible testimony.\r\nIn this context, perhaps the article by retired\r\nBrigadier Usman Khalid, published in the Pakistani daily\r\nThe Frontier Post of 29 September 1999, just three days\r\nago, best spells out the Pakistani security dilemma in the\r\nform of a bold confession. It states that\r\n“the armed forces of Pakistan have been steadfast in\r\nplaying their role in safeguarding the security of the\r\ncountry [Pakistan]. They have sought to safeguard\r\nthe nuclear deterrent of Pakistan, resisted pressures\r\nto withdraw support from the mujahidin in Kashmir,\r\nand have been steadfast in their support to the\r\nTaliban in Afghanistan. All of these are of vital\r\nimportance to Pakistan’s security and survival.”\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nIn fact, it is the intervention of Pakistan in\r\nAfghanistan, its support for the Taliban and its attempts to\r\njustify the Taliban’s defiance of the aspirations of the\r\ninternational community, including reprehensible attempts\r\nat Taliban recognition, which has eroded Pakistan’s\r\nreputation, causing its political isolation throughout the\r\nworld. Those who are aware of the Afghan situation and\r\nthe Afghan resolve to resist any foreign rule continue to be\r\nperplexed and puzzled in the face of the Pakistani position.\r\nHowever, despite Talibanism and Pakistan’s massive\r\nmilitary intervention in Afghanistan — both of which\r\nrepresent obvious breaches of the United Nations Charter,\r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law — we\r\nare delighted to note that the United Nations, following\r\nyears of skepticism or illusory thinking, appears, perhaps\r\nfor the first time and only since the open escalation of\r\nforeign military involvement in Afghanistan, to have\r\ndeveloped an in-depth perception of the longstanding bitter\r\nreality of the Pakistani role, its intervention, and the Taliban\r\nagenda in Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Li Hyong Chol (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nYet to our dismay, while this in-depth perception has\r\nbeen so long in developing, the plight of the Afghan nation\r\nhas remained unresolved. It is doomed to the terrible\r\npredicament prevailing in many parts of Afghanistan: the\r\ninadmissible acquisition of territory by force and\r\ninterference in its internal affairs. It is because of those\r\nfundamental questions that at the outset of my statement I\r\nraised the question of the survival of the United Nations as\r\nan effective global institution. Given its approach to\r\nAfghanistan, can we still put our hope in the United\r\nNations system for the resolution of the Afghan crisis or\r\nother similar or dissimilar crises? It is our earnest\r\nconviction that the litmus test for United Nations survival\r\nwill be its engagement, without any selectivity and in the\r\nframework of the State system, in the rigorous\r\nimplementation and enforcement of its Charter.\r\nPakistan is blatantly breaching the United Nations\r\nCharter, which explicitly requires all Member States to\r\nrefrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial\r\nintegrity or political independence of any State, as well as\r\nnumerous General Assembly and Security Council\r\nresolutions and other resolutions on terrorism and the use\r\nof mercenaries. The reports of the Secretary-General, his\r\nSpecial Envoy for Afghanistan and the United Nations\r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in\r\nAfghanistan clearly bring to light the bellicose, obstinate\r\nand intransigent attitude of the Taliban mercenaries.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations, acting through\r\nthe Security Council, has a duty to maintain international\r\npeace and security, in accordance with the Charter. The\r\nPakistani aggression, State-sponsored terrorism and other\r\nactivities, which threaten the peace and security of the\r\nregion and hamper regional development and cooperation,\r\nshould be identified, condemned and dealt with by taking\r\nappropriate measures.\r\nFurthermore, the Islamic State of Afghanistan\r\nearnestly expects the Security Council to consider the\r\nimposition of immediate sanctions against both the\r\nTaliban and their Pakistani mentors, in accordance with\r\nparagraph 15 of Security Council resolution 1214 (1998)\r\nof 8 December 1998 and in conformity with its\r\nresponsibility under the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations is also expected to use its good\r\noffices to convince the Pakistani leadership, including its\r\nmilitary intelligence wing, the Inter-Services Intelligence\r\n(ISI), to steer its policy away from intervention in\r\nAfghanistan and towards non-intervention, so that we can\r\nmove from a Pakistani-dictated position of subordination\r\nto a mutually dictated position of cooperation. The\r\nPakistani ISI should no longer thwart peace initiatives. A\r\nfirst step in this regard would be the withdrawal from\r\nAfghanistan of all armed Pakistanis, whether military\r\npersonnel or so-called religious volunteers. Pakistan\r\nshould also put a halt to its direct assistance to the\r\nTaliban, ranging from military hardware and oil to\r\nexpertise and tactical advice. Only under such pressure\r\nwill the Taliban resume peace negotiations.\r\nOn the verge of the next millennium, the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan genuinely hopes that, with the\r\nresolution of the Afghan crisis, it will be able to serve as\r\na factor for peace and stability in the region, promoting\r\ngood-neighbourliness, mutual respect and cooperation and\r\nacting as a transit country for trade between all its\r\nneighbours, without any distinction or preference.\r\nThe United Nations is earnestly expected to step up\r\nits efforts in the Afghan peace process. In this respect, we\r\ngreatly appreciate the untiring efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, his Special\r\nEnvoy for Afghanistan. The Islamic State of Afghanistan\r\nwelcomes and fully supports the 19 July Tashkent\r\nDeclaration of the Member States that make up the “six\r\nplus two” group, which it hopes will be fully observed.\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nRegrettably, the Taliban continue to voice their\r\nadamant opposition not only to the Tashkent Declaration\r\nbut to all other peace initiatives. We sincerely welcome\r\nparagraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/54/378) of 21 September 1999, which states,\r\n“it is noteworthy that only one week after the\r\nTashkent meeting, the Taliban began a major offensive\r\nagainst the United Front in the Shomali plains, located\r\nto the north of Kabul.”\r\nParagraph 3 further states,\r\n“The Taliban insist that the UF [United Front] must\r\nembrace the Emirate system while the UF question the\r\nTaliban\u0027s popular mandate to make this demand.”\r\nMindful of the principle that there should be a\r\npeaceful resolution of the conflict, the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan earnestly desires a broad-based, fully\r\nrepresentative and multi-ethnic government in Afghanistan.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan, which is struggling for\r\nsovereignty and the return of peace and normalcy through\r\nthe institution of such a government, earnestly aspires to the\r\nresolution of fundamental issues such as the restoration of\r\nand full respect for human rights in Afghanistan,\r\nparticularly the rights of women. Under the Taliban, women\r\nhave now been reduced to a voiceless and invisible state of\r\nnon-being, condemned to stay in their houses and stripped\r\nof their basic rights, even the rights to work and education,\r\nall of which is against the genuine tenets of Islam.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan welcomes the fact\r\nthat the first year of the new millennium will be observed\r\nas the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, as called for\r\nby the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we believe that it will\r\nprepare suitable ground for further understanding among the\r\nglobal family, thereby contributing to collective human\r\ncivilization.\r\nThis century introduced a new paradigm based on\r\ncollective security and international organizations, concerted\r\napproaches and international order, all based on the equal\r\nsovereignty of States. From the United Nations Charter to\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the new\r\nparadigm has affected all corners of the world. As a\r\ntroubled member of this global family, Afghanistan awaits\r\na collective endeavour by the international community to\r\ndeal with its problems, thereby helping the world, or at\r\nleast a part of the world, to become a better place for\r\nhumankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Moldova,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nicolae Tabacaru.\r\nMr. Tabacaru (Republic of Moldova): Let me join\r\nother delegations in congratulating Mr. Gurirab on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfourth session. His skill and experience will serve us well\r\nas he directs the vital work to be undertaken at this\r\nsession. I should also like to take this opportunity to\r\nthank his predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for his\r\noutstanding stewardship of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-third session.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Moldova\r\nwarmly welcomes the admission of the three new\r\nMembers of the United Nations: the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nthe Republic of Nauru, and the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nSince its admission to the United Nations in 1992,\r\nthe Republic of Moldova has consistently been an active\r\nsupporter of the world Organization. As a small country,\r\nwe depend on the United Nations for our security and for\r\nour very existence. We want to see it further strengthened\r\nand the sphere of its activities expanded. We believe that\r\nin this emerging new international order, it is more\r\nnecessary than ever that the United Nations be capable of\r\nfulfilling the role entrusted to it by the Charter, as the\r\nguarantor of peace, security and social justice throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nIt is from that perspective that we evaluate the\r\nUnited Nations reform process launched by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral; as we see it, reform means the rational\r\nadaptation of United Nations mechanisms to present and\r\nfuture needs. We owe the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, our gratitude and support for his reform proposals.\r\nEspecially, we welcome the implementation of the\r\nSecretary-General’s reform proposals aimed at fostering\r\ngreater internal coordination, streamlining procedures and\r\nrationalizing the activities of the Organization. In this\r\ncontext, I would like to underline the positive results thus\r\nfar achieved by the United Nations Development Group\r\nand the Executive Committee on Economic and Social\r\nAffairs. The preliminary application of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Assistance Framework in 18 pilot countries\r\nand more intense cooperation between Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the United Nations are also producing\r\npromising results.\r\nIntegration within the United Nations system is also\r\nmoving ahead at the country level. I can already see some\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nencouraging results from the Republic of Moldova’s “One\r\ncountry, one United Nations” policy. From this perspective,\r\nwe believe also that the integration of United Nations\r\nrepresentation at the country level will lead to substantive\r\nimprovements and greater coherence in the relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations system and the host country. I\r\ntake this opportunity to inform members that in the near\r\nfuture a United Nations common house will be officially\r\ninaugurated in the capital of our country, Chisinau.\r\nI would like to mention in this context the substantial\r\nassistance provided by the United Nations to my country\r\nthrough the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) office in the Republic of Moldova. The activities\r\ncarried out by the UNDP office contribute significantly to\r\nthe ongoing reform process.\r\nWe believe that the diversification and deepening of\r\ncollaboration among States has enhanced the development\r\nof regional and subregional cooperation as well. In fact, the\r\nCharter itself attaches great significance to regional\r\norganizations. Documents laying the foundations for\r\ncollaboration between the United Nations and various\r\nregional organizations have been drawn up, in particular in\r\nrecent years. General Assembly resolutions pertaining to\r\ncooperation between the United Nations on the one hand,\r\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE), the League of Arab States and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on the other, are\r\nrelevant from that point of view. Some regional\r\norganizations have acquired new areas of competence,\r\nincluding in the field of peace and security, and have\r\nbecome a trustworthy support for the United Nations in\r\ncontaining and eliminating local conflicts. For the near\r\nfuture, we may expect that additional regional organizations\r\nand groupings will be interested in setting up a cooperation\r\nframework with the United Nations, similar those that exist\r\nwith other regional organizations. The Republic of Moldova\r\nsupports that trend.\r\nAs a founding member of the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization, and as the country which at the\r\nend of this month will assume the presidency of that\r\norganization, the Republic of Moldova welcomes the recent\r\ndecision of the General Committee to include in the agenda\r\nof the fifty-fourth session an item concerning the granting\r\nof observer status in the General Assembly to the Black\r\nSea Economic Cooperation Organization. To this effect, the\r\nRepublic of Moldova would very much appreciate it if\r\nMember States lent their valuable support to the granting of\r\nobserver status in the Assembly to that organization.\r\nWe are fully aware of the fact that because of its\r\noutstanding role in dealing with world problems, the\r\nUnited Nations is confronted with a growing number of\r\nnew threats to international security and stability. In this\r\ncontext, peacekeeping operations represent one of the\r\nworld Organization’s main instruments with which to stop\r\nconflicts in various parts of the world and to create\r\nfavourable conditions for their political settlement. It is\r\nalso obvious that in recent years the United Nations has\r\nnearly exhausted its ability to respond to the increasing\r\nnumber of requests for such operations. Under these\r\ncircumstances, we support and encourage the trend\r\ntowards involving regional organizations and\r\narrangements, in cooperation with the United Nations, in\r\nthe mitigation of certain conflicts. At the same time, we\r\nconsider that peacekeeping operations should as a rule be\r\nundertaken under the auspices of the United Nations and\r\nin conformity with United Nations standards.\r\nStatements made during the general debate have\r\noffered an eloquent perspective on the major challenges\r\nconfronting the present-day system of international\r\nrelations and on the role that international organizations,\r\nand primarily the United Nations, have to play in order to\r\nmeet them. One of the most important issues spoken of in\r\nthis context is the maintenance of peace, security and\r\nstability in various regions affected by crisis and internal\r\nconflict. Unfortunately, developments in those regions\r\ncompel us to acknowledge the insoluble character of\r\nmany such conflicts. These so-called frozen conflicts have\r\na huge potential for destabilization and destruction. The\r\nKosovo tragedy has clearly shown how they can\r\ndegenerate if we do not succeed in working out timely\r\nlong-lasting solutions. The Secretary-General is absolutely\r\nright when he stresses that a tragic irony of many of the\r\ncrises that continue to go unnoticed and unchallenged\r\ntoday is that they could be dealt with by far less perilous\r\nacts of intervention than the one we witnessed recently in\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nAt the same time, one of the main conclusions to be\r\ndrawn from conflicts such as those in Kosovo and in\r\nBosnia is that no single organization or State is capable\r\nof solving conflicts of such complexity and scale on its\r\nown.\r\nThe uniqueness of the United Nations is defined\r\nparticularly by its capacity to efficiently mobilize the\r\nresources of the international community and to\r\norchestrate its efforts in order to defuse and solve crisis\r\nand conflict situations. That unique potential has to be\r\nmore actively and more efficiently used, particularly in\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nrelation to the internal conflicts confronted by some newly\r\nindependent States. Since 1992, when the majority of the\r\nex-Soviet republics became members of the United Nations,\r\ndozens of interventions concerning conflicts in these States,\r\nMoldova among them, have been spoken of in this\r\nAssembly. One of the main conclusions of those statements\r\nwas that without more active involvement by the\r\ninternational community those conflicts will remain\r\n“frozen”.\r\nIn this context, it bears mention that the United\r\nNations, as well as other international bodies and individual\r\nStates, have made an important contribution to ending the\r\nviolence and military clashes and in bringing the parties\r\ninvolved to the negotiating table. Another positive result\r\nfrom the actions of the international community has been\r\nthe parties’ acceptance of the idea of resolving their\r\ndifferences through peaceful means.\r\nFor this reason, the Republic of Moldova, like other\r\ncountries with similar problems in our own region, has\r\ncontinued to support more active involvement by the United\r\nNations and regional organizations in managing the\r\nconflicts which they have faced for many years now. We\r\nthink that the time is ripe to give more consideration to the\r\nquestion of how the root causes of those conflicts should be\r\nidentified and dealt with. In this respect the United Nations\r\ncan efficiently use its potential only through intensive\r\ncooperation and interaction with the European organizations\r\nand institutions, particularly OSCE. Through enhanced\r\nsynergy and avoidance of duplication, and by using and\r\nmaintaining consulting mechanisms at various levels and\r\nexchanging information about plans and activities between\r\nitself and those organizations, the United Nations can\r\nimprove the situation in countries affected by internal\r\nconflicts.\r\nHowever, there must be firm decisions about what\r\naction must be taken to ensure the implementation of the\r\nrelevant resolutions and decisions adopted of the United\r\nNations and the OSCE, the main international organizations\r\ninvolved in settling those conflicts. We believe that the\r\nGeneral Assembly should evaluate the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand OSCE from this point of view also.\r\nThat I refer to the issue of conflicts in some detail is\r\nnot incidental. The problem of the eastern region of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova has been repeatedly described, from\r\nthis rostrum, by representatives of my country. To my\r\nregret, I must inform of the Assembly that there has been\r\nno tangible progress towards a comprehensive settlement.\r\nThroughout the negotiations, we have sought to\r\naccomplish the purpose for which the Assembly was\r\nestablished: to replace mistrust and violent confrontation\r\nwith dialogue and agreement between the parties to the\r\nconflict.\r\nThe Government of my country has shown more\r\nthan once that it strongly advocates a peaceful resolution,\r\nthrough negotiations, of the conflict situation in\r\nTransnistria, in accordance with the norms and practice of\r\ninternational law and in collaboration with international\r\norganizations, primarily OSCE, and with the Russian\r\nFederation and Ukraine as mediators. Although it has\r\nmade the spirit of compromise evident, the Government\r\nfirmly believes that any proposal for a settlement must\r\nprovide for territorial integrity to be maintained and for\r\ncontrol over the territory of the whole country to be\r\nensured.\r\nDespite a reasonable compromise on the part of the\r\nconstitutional authorities, separatist tendencies still persist.\r\nA number of documents — elaborated with the active\r\nparticipation of OSCE and other mediators and signed by\r\nall parties involved — are being interpreted unilaterally,\r\nand in a manner contrary to their meaning, by the\r\nTransnistrian leaders. Moreover, these leaders are trying\r\nto impose certain concepts that do not exist in law and\r\nterritorial practice and are contrary to the principle of\r\nterritorial integrity. Here I refer to am referring to the\r\nconcept of “common State,” which has very frequently\r\nbeen imposed in discussions to define relations between\r\nthe central and local authorities in certain conflict zones.\r\nWe consider this concept dangerous due as it attempts to\r\ndistort the notion of statehood and State sovereignty and\r\nprovide a legal framework for the ideology of aggressive\r\nseparatism. I believe that the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations will also find this concept both\r\ninadequate and counter-productive as a means of\r\nresolving internal conflicts.\r\nIn Transnistria, we are striving for a rapid and\r\ndefinitive solution and a return to stability, and a return\r\nalso to respect for human rights, which continue to be\r\nviolated in this region. The case of the Ilascu group, and\r\nviolation of fundamental human rights and freedoms it\r\nrepresents are eloquent in this respect.\r\nWe consider it imperative for international efforts to\r\nsolve the current crisis situations, most of which have\r\nseparatism as their main cause, to be strengthened. In this\r\nconnection, I would mention that we fully share the views\r\nexpressed earlier by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nthe Russian Federation concerning aggressive separatism.\r\nIndeed, the international community and, first of all, the\r\nUnited Nations should decisively suppress any\r\nmanifestations of separatism and rigorously and consistently\r\ndefend the principles of sovereignty, integrity and the\r\ninviolability of national frontiers. To this end, the complete\r\neradication of outside encouragement and support for\r\nseparatist forces is most certainly necessary.\r\nAnother aspect of the Transnistrian problem is\r\nmilitary: this zone is famously overmilitarized, which has\r\nvery negatively affected the settlement process. Thousands\r\nof tons of shells and armaments — both accounted for and\r\nunaccounted for, and including equipment limited by the\r\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty — are\r\nstationed there. This military presence is in evident\r\ncontradiction to the Constitution of the Republic of\r\nMoldova, which declared the State’s neutrality and that\r\nforeign troops are not admissible in our country.\r\nAnother premise for accelerating the settlement\r\nprocess is, would undoubtedly be the immediate, complete,\r\nunconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops, as\r\nstipulated in OSCE summit decisions required by the CFE\r\nTreaty, the keystone of European security and may on no\r\naccount be violated.\r\nI hope that, together with our partners and the relevant\r\ninternational organizations, we can establish, very soon, an\r\neffective mechanism and detailed schedule for the takeover,\r\ndestruction or removal of the foreign military arsenal from\r\nRepublic of Moldova territory. I express my gratitude for\r\nthe political support and, especially, for the financial\r\nassistance provided by many United Nations Member States\r\nfor the withdrawal or elimination of those arsenals.\r\nI voice our hope that the proceedings of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-fourth session will be conducted in a\r\nspirit of solidarity and with a realistic and constructive\r\napproach to the complex issues confronting the\r\ncontemporary world at the end of this millennium. The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Moldova is committed to\r\ncontributing, alongside other Member States, to the\r\nfulfilment of the lofty goals of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I next call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Comoros, His Excellency Mr. Souef\r\nMohamed El-Amine.\r\nMr. El-Amine (Comoros) (spoke in French): It is an\r\nhonour and a pleasure for me to take the floor once again\r\nbefore this Assembly. At the outset I would like to\r\ncongratulate the President on his brilliant election to lead\r\nour work at this session. His election is an unparalleled\r\ntribute to all of Africa and particularly to his fraternal\r\ncountry, Namibia, which today sees one of its sons\r\npresiding over the destinies of this fifty-fourth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We are confident that his qualities\r\nas an eminent diplomat and his great experience guarantee\r\nthe success of our work.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\r\nglowing tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\r\nDidier Opertti, for the devotion and the ability with which\r\nhe conducted the previous session.\r\nAt the same time, allow me to express appreciation\r\nfor the full value of the efforts deployed by our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, in the service\r\nof our Organization. The evidence he gives of an untiring\r\nwill and of constant dedication to the human cause,\r\nespecially in the field of peace, deserve saluting, and I\r\nwould like to express all of our gratitude to him.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to wholeheartedly\r\nwelcome the delegations of the Republics of Kiribati and\r\nNauru and of the Kingdom of Tonga, and to express to\r\nall of them our congratulations on their having been\r\nadmitted to the great family of the United Nations.\r\nThe time has come to assess the century that is\r\ncoming to a close and to see together how we are going\r\nto face the challenges of the next millennium — a\r\nmillennium that we hope will be one of peace and\r\nprosperity, bringing hope to our peoples and our\r\ncountries. This is the wish of the Comorien people for all\r\nthe nations of the world. But how can we realize this\r\nwish?\r\nOur Organization offers the best framework for\r\nfacing the challenges of the third millennium, but it will\r\nneed to be supported by a more active commitment on\r\nour part, a greater willingness to face problems and a real\r\nwill to deal with them — without excessive fervour or\r\nuncertainty — and to resolve them rationally. With such\r\nwill we can achieve the objectives of the founders of our\r\nOrganization in the field of peace, justice and progress.\r\nAchieving a disarmed world, which will at the same\r\ntime guarantee peace, social justice and progress, is the\r\nfundamental purpose of our Organization. In addition, we\r\nall hoped that the 1990s would be the decade of peace\r\nand solidarity among nations, because certain positive\r\naspects led us to expect this. The various day-to-day\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nrealities we have experienced unfortunately are reviving our\r\nfears that the next millennium will begin in uncertainty\r\nabout the future of humanity.\r\nIn fact, the wars that are tearing our continents apart,\r\nthe grave violations of human rights, the extreme poverty\r\nto which many peoples have been reduced and which\r\nreveals the enormous disparities between the social strata,\r\nand the recent tragedies such as that in Kosovo make us\r\nfear the worst and require us to be more vigilant. Our\r\nOrganization, the efforts of which we salute, must persevere\r\nin the search for solutions for eliminating the major and\r\nvarious problems besetting the world today.\r\nHuman rights has always been an essential concern of\r\nour Organization. Thus, how can we not deplore that, at the\r\nthreshold of the next millennium, humanity is still\r\nwitnessing flagrant violations of fundamental rights. It is\r\nbecause of this major concern that I would like to salute\r\nhere the efforts to establish an international criminal court,\r\nwhich, I am certain, will contribute to greater justice. We\r\nhope that this court, once it becomes operational, will enjoy\r\nall the necessary independence to carry out its functions\r\nfully and effectively and to apply the fundamental\r\nprinciples of humanitarian law.\r\nWith regard to economic issues, we must agree that\r\neconomic recovery is not yet in sight for many countries,\r\nespecially those suffering from armed conflicts. Certainly\r\nmany agreements emerging from international meetings\r\nhave highlighted the special attention that must be paid to\r\nthe problems of developing countries. But we must insist\r\nfurther on this and demand that genuine solidarity with\r\nthese countries be shown. Through such solidarity positive\r\naction could be mobilized.\r\nWith regard to Africa, in general it continues to be\r\nmarked by several things. First, its external debt has\r\nbecome a major obstacle to development, especially\r\nbecause financial flows are often used for debt servicing\r\nrather than for promoting the expansion of the economy\r\nand sustainable development. Also, the level of debt has\r\ndiscouraged domestic and foreign investment. Secondly, the\r\ncontinent is heavily scarred by wars which have sharply\r\nchecked development. Thirdly, global trade practices have\r\nreduced the commercial prospects of the continent.\r\nFourthly, the continent is to some extent excluded from the\r\nglobal information revolution. In Africa the basic education\r\nsystem is generally the most limited, the effects of poverty\r\nare extreme, and the health system needs reforming.\r\nTo create the necessary conditions to solve these\r\ndifferent problems which are hampering the development\r\nof our African countries, national, regional and\r\ninternational initiatives must be undertaken, encouraged\r\nand supported by the international community. A genuine\r\npartnership among African countries must be the basis for\r\nsolid and effective cooperation that allows these countries\r\nto share their experiences and promotes the rapid\r\nintegration of regional economies.\r\nIn the context of this need for South-South\r\ncooperation, my country welcomed most favourably the\r\nholding of the special summit in Sirte, which revealed\r\nonce again the solidarity of African States and their\r\nsupport for Libya, a brother country. We believe that the\r\nconditions are now in place for the total and final lifting\r\nof the embargo imposed on that country. The summit also\r\nput in place new rules to improve the structures of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, with a view to an effective\r\nunion of its countries through the strengthening of\r\nsecurity and cooperation arrangements. In this regard the\r\nSirte summit continues to serve as a point of reference,\r\nand we hope its objectives will be achieved.\r\nI also take this opportunity to express our thanks to\r\nthe Government of Libya for the generosity it showed to\r\ncertain African countries, allowing them to honour their\r\ncommitments to the pan-African organization.\r\nMoreover, the international community, especially\r\nthe international financial institutions, must support these\r\nnational and regional efforts by facilitating their access to\r\nmarkets and investments, reducing debt constraints and\r\nallowing developing countries to benefit from new trade\r\nagreements.\r\nLike all developing countries, the Islamic Federal\r\nRepublic of the Comoros also faces enormous difficulties.\r\nThe regrettable events that have unfolded there since\r\nMarch 1997 have further weakened an economy that was\r\nalready in decline and beset by considerable deficits in\r\npublic finance; a chronic deficit in the balance of\r\npayments; a large foreign debt; and strong competition for\r\nexport resources by synthetic products.\r\nThis situation is of great concern to the Government\r\nwhich I have the honour to represent. It is firmly engaged\r\nin a process of development through the establishment of\r\nsolid bases for the rule of law and the adoption of a\r\npolicy of rehabilitation and economic and political\r\nrecovery through the strict management of public finances\r\nand the promotion of morality in administrative practices\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nand political customs. This rehabilitation policy should\r\nallow the State to fulfil its priority domestic commitments\r\ndomestically and to honour its commitments to its foreign\r\npartners.\r\nIn addition, other objectives to complement this good\r\ngovernance policy are being considered by the current\r\nGovernment. They include respect for human rights; the\r\nimprovement of social policies and hence of the efficacy of\r\nhealth and education services for all; the protection of\r\nchildren and women; the implementation of the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child; the advancement and\r\nmainstreaming of women; guaranteed autonomy for the\r\njudiciary; freedom of the press; and so on.\r\nTo encourage private investment and promote the\r\nintroduction of new technology and foreign capital,\r\nopportunities have been opened to domestic and foreign\r\ninvestors by suppressing constraints on approvals of foreign\r\ninvestments.\r\nFurthermore, aware of the enormous contribution\r\nSouth-South cooperation makes to development by offering\r\nthe opportunity to exploit the economic prosperity of other\r\nregions, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros must\r\nrespond to the two-fold necessity of participating fully in\r\nthe globalization process and of steadfastly prospering in its\r\nown regional and subregional environment. That is why it\r\nis striving further to consolidate its participation in the\r\nIndian Ocean Commission and planning to join other\r\ngroups of the region. These endeavours, undertaken since\r\nthe accession to power of the current Government, may\r\nwell be insufficient, but they constitute a serious and\r\nessential foundation, and a guarantee of in-depth reform.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAfter this general summary, I would be remiss if I\r\nfailed to report the prevailing political situation in the\r\nComoros. My country is experiencing a secessionist crisis\r\nin the sister island of Anjouan, which has shaken the very\r\nfoundations of the Republic and threatened its unity,\r\nterritorial integrity and, above all, the peace and tolerance\r\nthat have always characterized relations among the\r\ninhabitants of our four islands.\r\nMy country’s Government cannot endorse secession or\r\nindependence, which could dislocate the Comoros, whose\r\nunity and social coherence are the only guarantees for the\r\nevolution of harmonious social and economic development.\r\nThree inter-island conferences have been held under the\r\nauspices of the OAU and the League of Arab States with a\r\nview to rapidly settling this crisis. The most recent, held\r\nin Antananarivo, Madagascar, in April, resulted in an\r\nagreement to establish a new institutional framework to\r\nmeet the aspirations of the Comorians, guarantee unity\r\nand territorial integrity, and give each island greater\r\nautonomy. In this respect, I have the pleasant duty once\r\nagain to convey our sincere thanks to the Malagasy\r\nauthorities, not only for having held that important\r\nmeeting on the sisterly large island, but also for having\r\nestablished conditions conducive to our debate.\r\nAt the conference, the lack of cooperation and the\r\nintransigence of the representatives of the island of\r\nAnjouan — who postponed the signing of the final\r\ndocument — provoked extremist groups among the\r\npopulation of Grande-Comore, where anti-Anjouan riots\r\nbroke out. The threat of civil war, of hateful “insular\r\ncleansing” and the violent and forcible separation of\r\nfamilies led the National Development Army, in the face\r\nof the inertia of the political authorities, to act to avoid\r\nthe worse by assuming control of the country. A\r\ntransition Government was immediately formed to restore\r\nand guarantee civil peace and to create new republican\r\nand democratic institutions to ensure greater autonomy for\r\nthe islands, in compliance with the Antananarivo\r\nagreement. Thus, the consolidation of the Antananarivo\r\nagreement remains a Government priority and we are\r\ndoing everything possible to establish the conditions\r\nessential to the implementation of the agreement.\r\nIn the context of the settlement of the crisis, a frank,\r\ndirect and constructive dialogue has been established for\r\nthe first time between the central authorities and the\r\nAnjouan separatists. In this respect, a joint communiqué\r\nsigned on the Comorian island of Mohéli in July by the\r\nleaders of the two parties to the summit. I wish to stress\r\nthat Comorians view this act as a step towards the\r\nsettlement of the crisis. In his meetings with Comorians,\r\nthe Head of State, Mr. Azali Assoumani, is seeking the\r\nnecessary breakthrough to achieve an honourable peace to\r\nthe benefit of all that unites us.\r\nWe hope that the ratification of this agreement by\r\nour Anjouan brethren will not be long in coming so that\r\nthe process may continue in the interests of the united\r\nComorian people. The Comorian Government has begun\r\nin-depth reflection in order to draft the fundamental texts\r\nto govern the future union of the Comoros. The next step\r\nis very crucial in order to implement the published\r\nelectoral timetable, which anticipates, inter alia, a popular\r\nreferendum on the constitution and mayoral, legislative\r\nand presidential elections.\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nThe Comorian Government welcomed the relevant\r\nresolutions adopted by the OAU at its thirty-fifth Summit\r\nin Algiers; the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference at their most recent\r\nConference in Ouagadougou; the Ministers for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the League of Arab States at their 112th session\r\nin Cairo (A/50/864/Annex II, res. 1) and the Permanent\r\nCouncil of French-speaking Countries, meeting in Paris, in\r\nthe framework of the speedy establishment of constitutional\r\norder and of the settlement of the separatist crisis. To that\r\nend, we invite all people of good will and friendly,\r\nbrotherly and neighbour countries, as well as organizations,\r\nto come see with their own eyes the process that has been\r\nlaunched and to contribute to the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law in the Comoros.\r\nNevertheless, we remain concerned by the fact that\r\nholding elections in Anjouan would be tantamount to\r\nrecognizing secession or ratifying independence. Indeed,\r\nsuch a formula is contrary to the principle of unity of the\r\ncountry, the spirit of the Antananarivo agreement and the\r\nvery principles of the OAU, the sponsor of the agreement.\r\nIn this regard, we invite the OAU and the entire\r\ninternational community to join us in the consideration\r\nnecessary to overcome this dilemma.\r\nIn this vein, I should also like to take this opportunity\r\nto express the sympathy and profound gratitude of the\r\npeople and the Government of the Comoros to the countries\r\nof the region, especially South Africa and Madagascar;\r\nfriendly countries such as France and Egypt; and\r\ninstitutions such as the OAU, the League of Arab States,\r\nthe International Organization of La Francophonie and the\r\nEuropean Union, which have never ceased attaching their\r\nspecial interest to this problem. I should like to tell them\r\nonce again that the people of the Comoros hopes to be able\r\nto rely on them, again and always, to find a speedy solution\r\nto this crisis.\r\nThe Anjouan crisis, in the view of Comorians, is all\r\nthe more threatening to unity, peace and love among them\r\nas it is added to a painful 24-year-old problem, that of the\r\nComorian island of Mayotte. The Assembly will understand\r\nthe helplessness of a people threatened with dispersion,\r\nfollowing the amputation of part of the territory of its\r\ncountry, Mayotte, and witnessing an attempt by a sister\r\nisland to leave the Comorian union. This crisis has revived\r\nthe pain of the Comoros people caused by the problem of\r\nMayotte, which still shows no signs of being resolved. Our\r\nOrganization, which is regularly seized of this question, has\r\nalways recognized that Mayotte belongs to the Comoros\r\nand has adopted resolutions in favour of the integration of\r\nthe island into its natural family.\r\nThe Comorian Government, faithful to the\r\nfundamental principles of the Charter of our Organization,\r\ncontinues to give priority to dialogue to resolve this\r\nproblem. It is with deep respect for these principles that\r\nit appeals to France, a country with which the Comoros\r\nhas for long had close ties of friendship and cooperation,\r\nto consider opening a direct, constructive dialogue to find\r\na rapid, negotiated solution to this unfortunate dispute.\r\nMy country is very concerned about the situation in\r\nthe Middle East. It hopes that the new Israeli\r\nAdministration will commit itself more to the peace\r\nprocess begun on 4 September at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt,\r\nfor a lasting, fair and harmonious resolution of the Israel-\r\nPalestine crisis. We also hope that the other problems,\r\nregarding Syria and Lebanon, will soon be settled.\r\nThe question of Jammu and Kashmir continues to be\r\nof concern to us. We appeal to India and Pakistan to\r\nshow restraint in order to prevent any escalation in the\r\nregion.\r\nMy country welcomes the diplomatic initiatives of\r\nthe United Nations which made it possible for peace to be\r\nrestored to Kosovo and East Timor.\r\nWe also welcome the Lomé Peace Agreement of 7\r\nJuly 1999, with regard to the Sierra Leone conflict; the\r\nAbuja Agreement and its additional protocols regarding\r\nthe conflict in Guinea-Bissau; and the Lusaka ceasefire\r\nagreement, signed on 10 July 1999 by the parties to the\r\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nHaving noted these hopes reasons for hope, we\r\ncannot forget the situation in Angola and Somalia and the\r\nsituation prevailing between Ethiopia and Eritrea, where\r\nthere are no signs of a solution. The efforts made by the\r\nOAU should be supported by our Organization in order to\r\nachieve peace and reconciliation in these fraternal\r\ncountries.\r\nThe ideals of peace, security and development are\r\nthe responsibility of the international community, which\r\nmust work to make them a reality. Each of us must\r\ncontribute to ensure these values and to build a more\r\nhuman, peaceful and just world which is a harbinger of\r\nhope for future generations.\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for External\r\nRelations of Camaroon, His Excellency Mr. Augustin\r\nKontchou Kouomegni.\r\nMr. Kontchou Kouomegni (Cameroon)(spoke in\r\nFrench): We are pleased to note that the annual sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly are increasingly each year not only\r\na special forum for discussing international affairs, but also\r\nand in particular an opportunity for the democratic\r\nexpression of our shared experience, a time for each\r\nMember State of the Organization to freely state his or her\r\nviews.\r\nIn this context, Cameroon is particularly pleased that\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth\r\nsession has been assumed by a fraternal country, Namibia.\r\nWe regard it as highly symbolic that this role, at this\r\ndelicate time of a bridge between two centuries and two\r\nmillenniums, has been entrusted to you, Mr. Theo-Ben\r\nGurirab, worthy representative of Namibia, the last State in\r\nAfrica to recover its sovereignty. My country fully\r\nassociates itself with the praise addressed to you and we\r\nassure you of our full support as you exercise your difficult\r\nand lofty duties. I hardly need recall that your country\u0027s\r\nattainment of independence, just like the end of apartheid\r\nin South Africa, demonstrates what the United Nations and\r\nthe international community are capable of.\r\nCameroon wishes also to reiterate its full appreciation\r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the skill,\r\ndevotion, effectiveness and open-mindedness he\r\ndemonstrated throughout the fifty-third session.\r\nFinally, we wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continuing work to\r\nconsolidate peace and combat poverty, and for his special\r\nattention to the problems of the African continent and the\r\npoorest regions or those in crisis. His outstanding report on\r\nthe work of the Organization illustrates again this year the\r\nintelligence and determination that are his constant guides\r\nas he performs his duties. The work of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, carried out with an acute sense of the common\r\ninterest of all Member States, deserves our support.\r\nCameroon welcomes the new Members of the\r\nOrganization: Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga. Their admission\r\nreinforces the universality of our Organization.\r\nDespite great progress in many areas, this last decade\r\nof the twentieth century has been marked, and continues to\r\nbe marked, by less positive events in the world. More than\r\never before, therefore, we need to react, act and even act\r\npreventively, constantly and vigorously, in order to rectify\r\nan inappropriate course of events. There are still too\r\nmany conflicts. Too much human blood has been shed.\r\nToo many men and women have their fundamental rights\r\nand freedoms flouted. There is too much poverty, even\r\ndestitution, which is in stark contrast to an unparalleled\r\nopulence: Too many inequalities and too much\r\ninterference and domination persist in inter-State relations.\r\nThis succession of dangers is accentuated by the\r\nproblems of epidemics and illiteracy, and recalls the vital\r\nneed for greater solidarity between prosperous countries\r\nand developing countries, given the growing globalization\r\nof economies and the universal need for peace,\r\ndemocracy, prosperity, justice, the guarantee of\r\nfundamental human rights and the effective sovereignty of\r\nStates.\r\nCameroon therefore welcomes recent positive steps\r\non the path to peace. I refer to the Middle East, with the\r\nsigning of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Egypt. The\r\nresolution of the Kosovo crisis, and particularly the\r\nestablishment of an administration guaranteed by our\r\nOrganization, also deserves recognition. Cameroon\r\nencourages all actors in the Balkans and the Middle East\r\nto continue to advance resolutely towards lasting\r\nnormalization.\r\nWe are also very mindful of developments in East\r\nTimor, and we hope very much that wisdom will\r\nprevail — that is, that everyone will respect the process\r\ninitiated under United Nations auspices.\r\nWe welcome the holding in Maputo, Mozambique,\r\nof the First Meeting of the States Parties to the Ottawa\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on\r\nTheir Destruction. That meeting made it possible to\r\ncontinue the campaign to heighten the international\r\ncommunity’s awareness of the need to ban these ghastly\r\nweapons for ever. These weapons continue, particularly in\r\nAfrica, to indiscriminately mutilate children, women, the\r\nelderly, civilians and military personnel every day.\r\nCameroon, in confirmation of its commitment to this\r\ngreat struggle, recently ratified the Convention.\r\nWe welcome the results achieved in Sierra Leone,\r\nGuinea-Bissau and Northern Ireland. These and other\r\nadvances cannot, however, make us forget either the\r\ndeadly conflicts that continue to destroy lives or the\r\nthreats of holocaust that persist because of the lack of\r\nsignificant progress in the field of nuclear disarmament.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nIn this overall context, which remains full of elements, the\r\nproliferation of hotbeds of tension and conflict in Africa,\r\nparticularly in Central Africa, is a major source of concern\r\nfor Cameroon. That particular situation deserves more\r\nattention from the international community than ever\r\nbefore. Unfortunately, as the Secretary-General notes in his\r\nreport, these African crises, no matter how grave, have\r\nbasically been ignored.\r\nIs it conceivable that Somalia, fragmented and\r\ndisorganized, with its helpless, starving, sick people, and\r\nnow bereft of any viable state structure, could be purely\r\nand simply forgotten, abandoned and allowed to perish?\r\nCould the situation in Somalia today not be the fate of\r\nother countries on our continent and elsewhere? Should the\r\ninternational community abdicate its duty of solidarity with\r\nand assistance to Western Sahara, to the Sudan or in the\r\nconflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea?\r\nWe deplore the continuing bloody destructive crisis in\r\nAngola. That disastrous civil war directly or indirectly\r\ndestroys thousands of lives and systematically obliterates\r\ninfrastructure every day; this, too, seems to have been\r\nforgotten by everyone. Since the withdrawal of the United\r\nNations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), the States\r\nmembers of the United Nations Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, which\r\nfor a year now has been chaired by Cameroon, is trying to\r\ndo the impossible in order to prevent Angola from\r\npermanently locking itself up behind fratricidal closed doors\r\nin the face of this kind of widespread indifference.\r\nTogether with some other regional and international\r\ndiplomatic actors, the Standing Advisory Committee has\r\nalso made many efforts to try to restore peace in Burundi,\r\nthe Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Rwanda, particularly through the resolute\r\ndissemination of a culture of peace.\r\nIn this respect, Cameroon and all States Members of\r\nthe Committee welcome the peace accords on the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo signed in July in\r\nLusaka, Zambia. This came as a result of the doggedness\r\nand tenacity of African mediators, and it proves, if any\r\nproof is needed, that Africa, with the support of the\r\ninternational community, is able to overcome its difficulties.\r\nWe wish to reiterate the solemn appeal of the Standing\r\nAdvisory Committee to all signatories of these accords to\r\nsee to it that the peace process is carried through.\r\nCameroon is convinced that their determination to\r\nconsolidate peace will be supported by the international\r\ncommunity, in particular through the speedy and effective\r\nestablishment of the peacekeeping force that the United\r\nNations is planning to deploy in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo.\r\nNo matter what the cost, we must eradicate wars and\r\nconflicts in Africa, particularly in Central Africa. We\r\nmust halt the spiral of bloody confrontation and fighting\r\nin that subregion, which pits ethnic group blindly against\r\nethnic group, political group against political group. It is\r\nnot true that love of and devotion to one’s own people or\r\nfaith in one’s own ideals must be proved by one’s hatred\r\ntowards others. These grim tragedies, as we know, are not\r\ninevitable. Fundamentally, they are the result of practices\r\nto which Africa must put an end; otherwise, the continent\r\nwill be for ever left out of humankind’s majestic march\r\ntowards modernity.\r\nThe diagnosis of the causes of this situation is\r\nalready apparent: poverty, destitution, ignorance, the\r\nabsence of good governance, the fragility of the nations\r\nand States concerned, and acts of interference of all kinds\r\nare at the heart of the problem. Together we can combat\r\nthem and overcome them.\r\nThis is why one of the priorities of Cameroon’s\r\ndiplomacy, promoted by President Paul Biya, with the full\r\nendorsement of his peers, is to help guarantee peace,\r\nsecurity, stability, democracy and prosperity for the 100\r\nmillion women and men of Central Africa. This\r\ndetermination has guided our action as we head the\r\nUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security\r\nQuestions in Central Africa.\r\nAs we prepare to hand over the chairmanship to\r\nanother fraternal country, we would like to recall the\r\nprogress that member States have made together over the\r\nlast 11 months in our quest to strengthen peace, security\r\nand stability in Central Africa. The most significant\r\ninitiative undoubtedly was the threefold decision taken at\r\nthe meetings in Yaoundé, on 25 February 1999, and in\r\nMalabo, on 24 June 1999, by 9 of the 11 heads of State\r\nof Central Africa, to establish the Council for Peace and\r\nSecurity in Central Africa (COPAX); to adopt the\r\nYaoundé declaration on peace, security and stability in\r\ncentral Africa; and to integrate COPAX into the structures\r\nof the Economic Community of Central African States\r\n(ECCAS). Through this threefold decision, those heads of\r\nState have given our subregion a politico-diplomatic\r\norgan and ethical framework, as well as a code of\r\nconduct to meet the challenges of prevention,\r\nmanagement and the lasting settlement of crises and\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nconflicts. The practical modalities for the functioning of\r\nCOPAX are now being worked out in the secretariat of\r\nECCAS.\r\nSince crisis and conflict prevention remain absolute\r\npriorities, the States of Central Africa have continued their\r\nefforts to establish an early warning mechanism. This\r\nstructure has just acquired premises that serve as its\r\nheadquarters in Libreville, Gabon.\r\nA number of other initiatives mark important progress\r\nfor the establishment of peace and stability in Central\r\nAfrica.\r\nI refer first to the decision taken in June at the Malabo\r\nsummit by the heads of State of Central Africa to lend their\r\nprestige to the establishment of a subregional centre for the\r\npromotion of human rights and democracy. With the\r\nsupport of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, this centre will be both an observatory of\r\nrealities and trends and a kind of think tank to produce\r\nrecommendations on human rights and democracy. I wish,\r\non behalf of the peoples of Central Africa, to welcome the\r\nencouragement shown by Mrs. Mary Robinson for this\r\nproject, as well as the steps she has taken to follow up on\r\nthe resolution adopted on this subject by the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-third session.\r\nI also wish to refer to the establishment of a network\r\nof parliamentarians of Central Africa — an initiative that\r\nshould lead to the establishment of a subregional parliament\r\nwhich will be both a democratic forum and a subregional\r\nplatform for cooperation and harmonization of laws dealing\r\nwith questions of peace, security and integration.\r\nI would also mention the establishment of the Central\r\nAfrican Court of Justice, the seat of which will be in\r\nN’Djamena.\r\nI would like to refer to the high-level seminar held in\r\nYaoundé from 19 to 21 July this year on the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica, proceeding from the desire and determination of the\r\nleaders of Central Africa to build peace and progress in the\r\nsubregion. This high-profile meeting — which brought\r\ntogether parliamentarians, seasoned experts, civilians and\r\nmilitary, men and women with experience representing civil\r\nsociety and non-governmental organizations and whose\r\nreport was published by the United Nations — made it\r\npossible to identify ways and means for the specific\r\nimplementation in Central Africa of the recommendations\r\nof the Secretary-General.\r\nThe main actions recommended by the seminar to\r\nfollow up the very frank diagnosis of the situation seek to\r\npromote effectively human rights, participative\r\ndemocracy, methods for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, good governance, transparency, international\r\nhumanitarian law and accelerated national and regional\r\nintegration.\r\nThe proliferation and illicit circulation of small arms\r\nand light weapons in the region is another major concern\r\nfor the member countries of the Committee because they\r\nthreaten their stability. A subregional conference will be\r\nheld on this subject at the end of October in N’Djamena\r\nunder the aegis of the Committee and with United\r\nNations support. It will make it possible for member\r\nStates to assess the scale, causes, mechanisms and\r\nconsequences of this phenomenon and to envisage\r\nspecific steps to be taken.\r\nAll of these actions — in particular the\r\nestablishment of COPAX, the early warning mechanism,\r\nthe subregional human rights centre, the parliament and\r\nthe Central African Court of Justice — are challenges, not\r\nmerely for Central Africa itself, but clearly for the entire\r\ninternational community. They will be priority areas for\r\nfruitful bilateral and multilateral cooperation at the\r\nthreshold of the new millennium. That is certainly the\r\nwish of the peoples of Central Africa.\r\nThe design of a subregional policy for peace,\r\nstability, democracy and development in Central Africa is\r\npartly related to the domestic policy of Cameroon. The\r\nhead of State has always believed that there is no crisis\r\nthat cannot be resolved peacefully through dialogue,\r\npooling of efforts and especially through respect for the\r\nlaw. It is this conviction that prompted Cameroon to\r\nstress the search for a settlement through legal means of\r\nthe dispute with the Federal Republic of Nigeria regarding\r\nthe land and maritime border.\r\nIn this year which marks the closing of the United\r\nNations Decade of International Law, we must forcefully\r\nreaffirm our total support for the rule of law in inter-State\r\nrelations and the peaceful settlement of disputes, including\r\nthrough jurisdictional means when other mechanisms have\r\nproved to be ineffectual. That is why we urge the\r\ninternational community to continue to help our two\r\ncountries, Cameroon and Nigeria, to adopt effective\r\nmeasures to strengthen peace and the climate of\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nconfidence which has emerged following the contacts at the\r\nhighest level which have taken place this year.\r\nPending the verdict of the International Court of\r\nJustice in The Hague, three of these measures could be\r\ntaken right now: a solemn declaration of commitment to\r\nabide by the Court’s decision, withdrawal of armed forces\r\nfrom the battlefield to positions which they held before the\r\noutbreak of fighting, and the lifting by Nigeria of its recent\r\nreservations about the optional clause regarding binding\r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice,\r\nreservations which negate an international society based on\r\nlaw. The positive winds of change now blowing across\r\nNigeria, following the coming to power of the\r\ndemocratically elected civilian regime, give us enormous\r\nhope.\r\nThrough the work it did last year, Cameroon, like\r\nother States in Central Africa, is resolutely committed to\r\nsaving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. But\r\nwe did more than that. We also determined for the sake of\r\nfuture generations to protect the environment and to\r\nsafeguard the natural resources. An example of this was the\r\nsummit on conservation and sustainable forest development\r\norganized last March in Yaoundé in the presence of heads\r\nof State and Government of the subregion and a\r\ndistinguished host, His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the\r\nDuke of Edinburgh of the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland, who is past President of the World\r\nWide Fund for Nature.\r\nFour resolutions were adopted by the heads of State\r\nand Government of Central Africa to preserve and extend\r\nthe millions of hectares of forest in our subregion. They\r\nundertook to conserve and manage the forests of Central\r\nAfrica in a sustainable manner to safeguard our rich\r\nbiodiversity. They then undertook, in particular, to protect\r\nnew transnational forest zones in the Congo basin. Then the\r\nmajor partners and donors agreed to provide financial and\r\ntechnical assistance to implement the resolutions and\r\ncommitments adopted at the Yaoundé summit. Finally, the\r\nsummit participants agreed that good forest management is\r\nan important part of work for sustainable development in\r\nCentral Africa.\r\nHowever, in the areas of the protection, conservation\r\nand sustainable management of forests and biodiversity, a\r\nprofound dilemma has arisen. Central Africa is, after the\r\nAmazon region of South America, the second largest\r\nforested area of the world whose natural characteristics are\r\ndecisive for the balance of the biosphere and the\r\necosystems of the entire planet. The accelerated and\r\nmindless destruction of this forest would in fact be a\r\ndirect way to prepare for the disappearance of all life on\r\nearth. In a word, the forests of Central Africa are the\r\nlungs of the world.\r\nFollowing the Yaoundé summit, the senior officials\r\nof Central Africa and the peoples concerned became\r\nclearly aware of their duty to all humankind, a duty that\r\nshould be reflected in the sound conservation and\r\nmanagement of forests and the diverse resources they\r\ncontain. But at the same time, the experts rightly noted\r\nthat this would involve extremely heavy and increasingly\r\nhigher costs. The costs of protecting species, reforestation\r\nand reintroducing animals, as well as the administrative\r\ncosts involved in the functioning of the institutions\r\nneeded to do those jobs, will be an additional burden on\r\nthe already meagre resources of the countries of our\r\nsubregion.\r\nThis is why we believe that it would only be right\r\nfor the whole of humankind — for which we are making\r\nthis vital sacrifice of forest and biodiversity\r\nconservation — to find the ways and means to support us\r\nin this work for the common good. This could be done by\r\nproviding matching funds or, better yet, by bringing about\r\ngenuine global action under the guidance of the United\r\nNations and financed by a fund for the preservation and\r\nsustainable management of forests and biodiversity in\r\nCentral Africa. That fund would support all the important\r\npreliminary work to be done in this essential area of\r\nglobalization.\r\nWe will be submitting a draft resolution on this\r\nsubject for the kind consideration of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWhen Cameroon campaigns with other States for the\r\nprotection of the environment and for the safeguarding of\r\nnatural resources, we do so very mindful of the long term,\r\nwhich has meaning only in relation to the future of\r\nmankind, and of younger generations in particular. We are\r\nall the more conscious of the importance of the legacy we\r\nwill leave for the adults of tomorrow because more than\r\n46 per cent of the population of Cameroon will reach\r\nadulthood at the beginning of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe proportion of our children who are today under 15\r\nyears of age, like all men and women of the world in the\r\nnext century, have a legitimate right to demand of us, as\r\nthe most important part of our legacy, peace, security and\r\nstability in freedom and development and in a healthy\r\nenvironment. That is why, in conclusion, I wish to\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\naddress our partners in the prosperous countries, particularly\r\nthe Group of Eight.\r\nI wish first of all to say how much we appreciate the\r\nsteps that have been taken this year to reduce the debt\r\nburden of the poorest countries, particularly those in our\r\ncontinent. According to the Secretary-General, the African\r\ndebt burden represents more than 300 per cent of the value\r\nof goods and services exported from the region. Therefore,\r\nthe spirit of solidarity in the Group of Eight, which is a\r\ngood sign, must be pursued and consolidated while taking\r\ninto account the situation of the so-called medium-income\r\ncountries. That spirit of solidarity must be resolutely\r\ncontinued and take root in all other developed countries.\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s in-depth coverage of many\r\nsubjects in his report calls for us to reflect on them. I will\r\ntake up just one of these subjects: AIDS.\r\nLike other pandemics, AIDS not only jeopardizes the\r\nfuture of millions of African men and women, it is also a\r\nmortal danger for all humankind. To show a lack of\r\nconcern for its ravages in Africa, no matter what part of the\r\nworld one comes from, would be suicidal indifference. The\r\nfuture of the world is more indivisible than ever before.\r\nThe choice can no longer be postponed — the choice\r\nbetween the universal common good and the chaos caused\r\nby poverty, destitution, ignorance, injustice, the absence of\r\ngood governance, interference, wars, et cetera.\r\nThe end of this century shows every sign of serving as\r\na loud and clear call to the whole of mankind, but first and\r\nforemost to the leaders of nations. The end of the century\r\nhas made hope possible and has brought about the global\r\nadvancement of the values of peace, democracy, solidarity\r\nand the struggle for human rights. These principles must\r\nnot merely guide each nation; we believe that they should\r\nalso inspire the relations between nations. The staunch\r\nresolve of all countries to promote these principles together\r\nis the only guarantee of a better future for humanity. In\r\norder to bring this about, mankind as a whole —\r\nincreasingly more united and in solidarity under the banner\r\nof the United Nations — has a duty to provide speedy\r\nassistance wherever the life and dignity of the human being\r\nhave been seriously undermined or threatened.\r\nAccordingly, it is clear that the international\r\ncommunity, assembled within the United Nations, has an\r\ninalienable, inviolate and sacred right to act. This universal\r\nright to act, whose letter, spirit, legality and legitimacy\r\ncome from the Charter itself, is the reflection and the\r\ninevitable consequence of the changes occurring in the\r\nworld today. Clearly, it excludes any form of interference.\r\nA new world has thus been born; we must\r\nacknowledge this from now on. The Millennium\r\nAssembly and the Millennium Summit, to be held in the\r\nyear 2000, should embody the spirit of that new world\r\nand set it in order.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the Minister\r\nfor External Relations and Cooperation of Burundi, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Severin Ntahomvukiye.\r\nMr. Ntahomvukiye (Burundi) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me first of all to associate myself with previous\r\nspeakers in expressing to you, Sir, and to the members of\r\nthe Bureau, my delegation\u0027s warm congratulations on your\r\nelection to lead us in the General Assembly at this\r\nsession. You can count on our total support for the\r\naccomplishment of your difficult task.\r\nI would also like to express my appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti, for the skill and\r\ncompetence he exhibited during his mandate.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of\r\nNauru and the Kingdom of Tonga on having joined the\r\ngreat family of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, allow me to pay tribute to the work of Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, the Secretary-General of our Organization,\r\nfor his ceaseless efforts in favour of international peace\r\nand security. My country, Burundi, fully appreciates his\r\nvaluable contribution to the search for a negotiated\r\npolitical solution to the crisis it has suffered since October\r\n1993.\r\nAs the work of the current session of the General\r\nAssembly is taking place, my country is striving to turn\r\na new page in its history. Burundis have decidedly chosen\r\ndialogue and negotiation to put an end to the armed\r\nconflict that has lasted for almost six years. The Arusha\r\npeace talks that began in June 1998 under the aegis of the\r\nformer President of the sisterly country of Tanzania,\r\nMwalimu Julius Nyerere, are being actively pursued and\r\nare now at a crucial stage.\r\nThe sixth round of the Arusha peace talks, which\r\nended a few days ago, was preceded by fruitful\r\nconsultations held in Dar-Es-Salaam among the six\r\nprincipal negotiators aimed at reaching a compromise\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nbased on the drafts submitted by the negotiating parties or\r\ngroups of parties. These consultations, which represent the\r\nkeystone of the peace process, should resume on 4 October.\r\nWe hope that this time they will have tangible results that\r\ncould serve as a basis for the final Arusha agreement.\r\nLet me briefly recall the specific context in which the\r\nArusha process was initiated in June 1998: five years of\r\nrelentless fratricidal war between the rebels and the\r\nGovernment, in which the principal victims had been, as\r\nthey continue to be, hundreds of thousands of innocent\r\nchildren, women and elderly people, for the most part\r\nunarmed. More than 30 years of massacres and killings\r\nhave torn asunder the very fabric of society and resulted in\r\nentrenched hatred and extreme mistrust among the various\r\nethnic and political groups. Repeated crises have resulted in\r\nmassive flows of refugees and a major diaspora.\r\nFurthermore, economic development plans have been\r\nconsistently hamstrung by recurring political instability.\r\nIt was in that context that the Government objectively\r\nand deliberately decided to abandon the logic of war and to\r\nchoose political dialogue in which all the people of Burundi\r\ncould participate without exception, regardless of the\r\nmanner — peaceful or armed — in which they previously\r\nhad chosen to make their political demands. The armed\r\ngroups were a particular focus of this dialogue, and it was\r\nmainly because of them that the negotiations were held\r\noutside the country.\r\nThe goal is to reach a comprehensive peace agreement\r\nand ultimately achieve full national reconciliation among\r\nthe entire population of Burundi, without exception.\r\nSeveral obstacles continue to stand in the way of that\r\nlofty goal, which will not be attained if timely efforts are\r\nnot made to overcome those challenges.\r\nThe first obstacle is the failure of the armed rebel\r\nfactions to participate in the negotiations. Differences of\r\nopinion within those movements, where the armed groups\r\nno longer recognize the authority of the political leaders\r\nwho are participating in the Arusha negotiations and thus\r\nreject the outcome ahead of time, have resulted in a\r\nsituation in which the validity and viability of any peace\r\nagreement reached without those parties would be in doubt.\r\nThe Government of Burundi believes that it is\r\nimperative to set aside the formalities advocated by the\r\nmediators and to invite the armed factions to participate\r\nfully in the peace process. The Government of Burundi is\r\nwilling to consider any form of negotiation with them,\r\nwithin or outside the process.\r\nMediation should take place immediately, because\r\nwe are working against the clock in this fragile peace\r\nprocess, which could be jeopardized or brought to a halt\r\nby events. If, after being invited, the armed factions or\r\nother parties to the negotiations refuse to participate in the\r\npeace process, we would agree with the mediators that\r\nBurundi, in close and steadfast cooperation with its\r\nneighbours, must isolate and neutralize the rebels or other\r\nparties that are unwilling to participate in the negotiations.\r\nThe second obstacle is the continuing violence. In\r\nother crisis situations, political dialogue for conflict\r\nsettlement is preceded by a ceasefire or a suspension of\r\nhostilities. In the case of Burundi, however, that necessary\r\ncondition for negotiation has been neglected since the\r\nbeginning, as if it were optional. The Government draws\r\nto the attention of the subregion and of the international\r\ncommunity the serious and continuing acts of violence\r\ncommitted by the rebels despite the ongoing peace\r\nnegotiations. These unrestrained and cowardly acts of\r\nviolence, whose main target is unarmed civilians, have no\r\nmoral or political justification. No one even claims\r\nresponsibility; it is pure terrorism.\r\nIf the rebels were eventually to use as a pretext the\r\nfact that they had wished to participate in the\r\nnegotiations, it would have no validity because, as I have\r\njust stated, the Government is open to any initiative that\r\nmight lead to the cessation of the hostilities, which have\r\ngone on for far too long. The situation is serious, and the\r\nGovernment of Burundi requests the international and\r\nregional communities to help it in the following ways.\r\nFirst, through effective cooperation with\r\nneighbouring countries in the area of security, including\r\nwith the Republic of Tanzania, with which cooperation\r\ndecisions were taken at the ministerial level on two\r\noccasions, in February and August 1999; those decisions\r\nhave not been implemented. There is no doubt that if\r\nthose decisions were translated into joint action on the\r\nground, both external and internal rebel activities would\r\nsoon cease.\r\nSecondly, it is necessary to disarm and neutralize\r\nthose Burundi rebels who are active in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, where they are able to obtain a\r\nready supply of arms and ammunition for their bases in\r\nTanzania, as they have not been able to re-establish those\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nthey lost in South Kivu in 1997 after the first war in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThirdly, the countries of the region must wage a\r\ncommon struggle against transnational rebel movements,\r\narms trafficking and genocidal ideology. Those movements\r\nhave created alliances without borders. Among the rebels\r\nwho operate in Burundi are the Interahamwe, the former\r\nRwandan armed forces and Ugandan rebels, among others.\r\nThe Burundi rebellion has become regional in scope and\r\nmust be combated from that perspective. Intensified activity\r\nhas been noted on the part of the factions in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo since the Lusaka agreement, which\r\nprovided for their disarmament. The conflict is thus being\r\nregionalized, with Burundi and/or Tanzania as its epicentre.\r\nPrevention is better than cure. There is a real risk of\r\nanother regional conflagration resulting from the countries\r\nconcerned taking measures to protect themselves against\r\nthese widespread rebellions. In any case, the Government\r\nwill find it difficult to sign the peace agreement if it is not\r\npreceded by an effective halt to the violence on the ground.\r\nThe population, parts of which are still being massacred,\r\nwould simply reject it.\r\nThe third — although not the least significant —\r\nobstacle to the peace process is the extreme poverty that\r\nthreatens the people of Burundi with social and economic\r\nannihilation. That poverty is not the result of a reduction in\r\nagricultural production, which has continued somehow\r\nthanks to the hard-working nature of our countryfolk. Nor\r\nis it the result of the embargo imposed by the countries of\r\nthe region, since economic and financial cooperation with\r\nthose countries was and still is very limited. It results above\r\nall from the freezing of bilateral and multilateral\r\ncooperation by certain partners, countries and financial\r\ninstitutions in line with the economic sanctions imposed by\r\nthe subregion. Those regional sanctions were suspended on\r\n23 January this year, and Burundi expected that, mutatis\r\nmutandis, our international partners would resume their\r\ncooperation in conformity with the subregional action. That\r\nhas not yet happened, and some financial institutions, which\r\nanticipate no practical problems, are blocked by their\r\nshareholders at the political level. It is said that we will\r\nhave to wait for the signing, or even the implementation, of\r\nthe Arusha Agreement.\r\nPeace and national reconciliation in Burundi will not\r\nbe restored through revolution. It is a process that will be\r\nconsolidated over time. Nothing spectacular will happen the\r\nday the peace agreement is signed. It is progressive reform\r\nactivities, taking place as a result of courageous and\r\ndetermined political will, that will stabilize the country\r\nover the months and years following the signing of the\r\nagreement. All the parties involved in the negotiations\r\nagrees that peace will be not an event, but a process.\r\nFurthermore, the rate at which negotiations proceed will\r\nnot be subject to the Government’s control; it will be\r\nlinked to the procedures followed by the mediators and to\r\nthe willingness of the 17 other parties to the negotiations\r\nto place the national interest above all else, to distinguish\r\nbetween what is essential and what is of secondary\r\nimportance, and to realize that the true road to peace will\r\nbegin after the signing of the Arusha Agreement, among\r\nthe citizens of Burundi themselves.\r\nThe Government of Burundi calls on its partners to\r\nreassess the situation and consider the realities on the\r\nground as a matter of great urgency. The extreme stress\r\nunder which the population has been suffering for six\r\nyears is pushing it towards a popular uprising. The\r\nresponsibility lies with the international community,\r\nwhich is committed in this respect. The Government has\r\nprovided all it can: proof of its irreversible political will\r\nto negotiate until a peace agreement is reached.\r\nThe Great Lakes region has become a real powder\r\nkeg because of the persistence of insecurity. With regard\r\nto the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi\r\nwelcomes the signing in July of the Lusaka Peace\r\nAgreement. We call on all the parties to that conflict to\r\ncontinue to make efforts to restore a climate of dialogue,\r\ntrust and reconciliation, so that energy can be\r\nconcentrated on actions aimed at economic recovery and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nBurundi is not a belligerent in the war that is pitting\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo against some of its\r\nneighbours. The Government of Burundi has already had\r\nthe opportunity to explain that fact to the international\r\ncommunity on several occasions in various forums,\r\nincluding from this lofty rostrum last year; in Lusaka,\r\nwhere it participated in all the meetings as an observer\r\nand as one of the countries neighbouring the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo that were concerned about the\r\nsecurity of their common border; and in meetings of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity.\r\nListening to the statement made in this Assembly by\r\nthe Chairman of the delegation of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo on 29 September, I was astonished\r\nby his confusion and the degree of malice he expressed\r\ntowards my country, Burundi. I should like to respond by\r\nmaking several comments.\r\n25\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nFirst, Burundi is not at war with the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, either individually or in alliance\r\nwith any other party.\r\nSecond, Burundi has no reason to be at war with the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is true that it is poor\r\nand that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is rich. But\r\nBurundi has never wanted, does not want, and will never\r\nwant to live off the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It\r\nwill develop a policy of normal cooperation with that\r\ncountry, as has always been the case, in particular within\r\nthe Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries.\r\nFurthermore, the trading arrangements that exist between\r\nthe border towns and border provinces do not cause\r\nBurundi any problems and should continue.\r\nThird, Burundi has no political ambitions in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, at either the central or\r\nthe provincial level.\r\nFourth, Burundi had just signed an agreement for\r\ncooperation on border security when war broke out.\r\nFifth, Burundi has adopted an attitude of strict\r\nneutrality with regard to the conflict, and has no interest in\r\nit.\r\nSixth, several months after war broke out Burundi was\r\ninformed of the presence among the Congolese troops of\r\nthe armed Burundi rebel movement, the FDD. Burundi’s\r\nassessment was that the FDD had a threefold objective:\r\nfirst, to obtain arms and munitions to strengthen their bases\r\nin Tanzania; secondly, to cross Lake Tanganyika and\r\nrecover the bases they had lost in south Kivu facing the\r\ncapital, Bujumbura, and the provinces of Bubanza and\r\nCibitoke, where the civil war broke out in 1994; and,\r\nthirdly, to obstruct trade on Lake Tanganyika to and from\r\nBurundi through the port of Mpulungu in Zambia, which is\r\nthe only import-export corridor remaining following the\r\neconomic blockade imposed by the region in an attempt to\r\nsuffocate the country.\r\nSeventh, Burundi had to defend itself, and decided to\r\nadopt necessary border defence and security measures on\r\nland and on Lake Tanganyika in order to counter-attack the\r\nFDD rebels. It was a question of life or death. Those\r\nmeasures will remain in place as long as the threat of\r\ninsecurity caused by the FDD, and coming from the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, remains.\r\nThat is the absolute truth. The allegations made by the\r\ndelegation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo that\r\nBurundi is acting aggressively towards their country, are\r\ngroundless and based on invention and misinformation.\r\nBurundi is ready to do all it can to help to resolve the\r\nconflict. It welcomes in particular the fact that two\r\nmilitary observers were sent to Burundi in the framework\r\nof the pre-deployment exercise decided upon by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nBurundi cannot fail to welcome the prospects for a\r\nfinal resolution of the crisis in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, which would immediately remove the threat\r\nof insecurity at the common border and, we hope, involve\r\nthe FDD rebels in the peace process in Burundi.\r\nAt this final General Assembly session of the\r\nmillennium, my delegation hails the giant steps taken by\r\nmankind in science and technology, information and\r\ncommunication, democracy and development —\r\nespecially during the twentieth century, which is now\r\ndrawing to a close. At the same time, we deplore the\r\nscourges that have marked this century, such as all\r\nmanner of wars and conflicts and a range of evils and\r\nnatural or man-made catastrophes. Our greatest wish is\r\nthat the new millennium will bolster our achievements\r\nand add new triumphs for the well-being of the whole of\r\nmankind. We want to see in the next millennium a world\r\nin which peace will prevail over conflict, justice over\r\ninjustice and impunity, freedom over oppression and\r\ngenerosity over selfishness.\r\nWe seek the creation of a world in which the gap\r\nbetween rich countries and poor countries will be bridged;\r\na world in which all men and all women will live decent\r\nlives, work in peace and eat their fill; a world in which\r\nthe concepts of freedom, democracy, brotherhood and\r\ndevelopment can have true meaning in every corner of the\r\nearth.\r\nFor all peoples and all nations to set about attaining\r\nthese purposes, the United Nations must play the role of\r\nvanguard and catalyst to generate and maximize all the\r\nnecessary energy. The key to such success is, first and\r\nforemost, peace. The peace that we desire for Africa we\r\nalso want to see benefitting all mankind everywhere on\r\nearth.\r\nThe President: I call next on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Regional Cooperation of Rwanda, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Augustin Iyamuremye.\r\nMr. Iyamuremye (Rwanda) (spoke in French): I\r\nwish first of all, on behalf of my delegation, to join other\r\n26\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fourth session. The tact and insight you have displayed\r\nfrom the outset bode well for the success of our work.\r\nI also pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti,\r\nwho guided the work of the Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession, and to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his\r\ntimely report on the work of the Organization and for the\r\nimportant statement he delivered to the General Assembly.\r\nOn behalf of my country, I welcome the new\r\nMembers of the United Nations: the Republic of Kiribati,\r\nthe Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. We\r\ncongratulate them warmly on joining the great United\r\nNations family.\r\nDuring the twentieth century, which is now drawing to\r\na close, the world has been profoundly affected by many\r\nstriking events. In the sphere of technology, for example,\r\nwe have seen great progress leading to the expansion of\r\ncommunication to the point where the world has become a\r\nglobal village. The world rejoices at its liberation from\r\napartheid and from colonialism in nearly all countries.\r\nHere, my delegation welcomes the endeavours of the\r\nUnited Nations, including its focus on the solidarity that is\r\nthe foundation of our Organization, which led to that\r\nsuccess.\r\nBut those positive achievements do not mean that all\r\nhas been perfect in the twentieth century. In fact, a variety\r\nof disasters and tragedies inflicted on humans by humans\r\ncontinue to ravage mankind. Despite scientific progress,\r\nepidemics continue to take human lives by the thousand.\r\nTwo particularly dreadful world wars devastated the world.\r\nHateful acts of genocide have been committed.\r\nIn that connection, my country, Rwanda, had the\r\nmisfortune in 1994 to be the victim of a genocide that took\r\nmore than a million lives. Planned and organized by the\r\ngovernment machinery of the day, that genocide was\r\ncarried out in full view of the international community,\r\nwhich was unable to stop it. The people of Rwanda appeals\r\nto the conscience of the international community never\r\nagain to permit such a tragedy anywhere in the world. We\r\nhave every right to expect this.\r\nAs we express that wish, investigations have been\r\ncarried out by countries such as Belgium and France, and\r\nothers, by the Organization of African Unity and the United\r\nNations, are under way to identify those responsible for the\r\ngenocide in Rwanda. We want those responsible to be\r\nsubject to punishment throughout the world.\r\nFurther, we welcome the General Assembly address\r\nby President Clinton of the United States, in which he\r\nreferred to the creation of an international coalition\r\nagainst genocide, an idea that had been put forward at the\r\nfiftieth session by His Excellency Mr. Pasteur Bizimungu,\r\nPresident of the Rwandese Republic.\r\nIn the wake of the genocide, nearly the entire\r\npopulation of Rwanda was displaced. Most Rwandese\r\nwere widows, of whom 34 per cent had become heads of\r\nhousehold. There were thousands of orphans, most of\r\nwhom had also become heads of their households. Many\r\nchildren were involved in these acts of genocide; they\r\ndeserve to be reeducated in an appropriate setting. My\r\nGovernment has an ambitious programme to take up the\r\nchallenge of helping survivors of the genocide coexist\r\nwith the perpetrators.\r\nWe are fortunate today that thanks to the vigorous\r\nmeasures which have been taken and to the support of the\r\ninternational community, my Government has been able\r\nto ensure security throughout its territory, bring the\r\nrefugees home and house them, get the economy back on\r\ntrack and ensure food security.\r\nAfter the genocide of 1994, Rwanda found itself\r\nwith its judicial system completely destroyed and its\r\nprisons crammed with suspects. The Government\r\ntherefore began rebuilding the national judicial system\r\nand collaborated in establishing international judicial\r\nmachinery to deal with that heinous crime against\r\nhumanity, genocide.\r\nI must pay a tribute here to the international\r\ncommunity, which came to my country’s assistance by\r\nestablishing the United Nations International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). But we must highlight that\r\nalthough we welcome the establishment of the Tribunal,\r\nwe regret the slowness of its trial procedures and its\r\nsometimes secretive way of choosing suspects to try. The\r\nGovernment of Rwanda states that it is nevertheless\r\nwilling to collaborate with the Tribunal and to do\r\neverything possible to speed up its proceedings.\r\nOne of the difficulties involved in arresting the\r\ncriminals who committed genocide in Rwanda is that\r\nwhen the Government that organized the genocide fell, all\r\nits various acolytes scattered throughout the world.\r\nFortunately, some of them have been arrested with the\r\n27\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nassistance of the countries that took them in. We wish to\r\npay a ringing tribute to the fraternal countries that have\r\narrested and extradited criminals sought by the Tribunal for\r\nRwanda. We urge them to continue their cooperation and\r\ncall on those that have not yet been able to do so to fulfil\r\nthis obligation to humankind.\r\nWe note with satisfaction also that in his report\r\n(S/1999/957) on the protection of civilians in armed\r\nconflict, the Secretary-General recommends to the Security\r\nCouncil that it should make full cooperation obligatory\r\nbetween Member States with the International Criminal\r\nTribunals for Rwanda and for Yugoslavia. We note also\r\nthat this recommendation by the Secretary-General is in line\r\nwith the wishes of the several speakers who have spoken\r\nup either in the Security Council or here in the Assembly,\r\nagainst the culture impunity. In this we find hope that there\r\nwill never again, anywhere in the world, be a genocide.\r\nI would mention another very important programme by\r\nmy Government: for national reconciliation and to establish\r\nthe constitutional rule of law. As part of the programme,\r\nmy Government has established two commissions: the\r\nNational Commission for Human Rights and the\r\nCommission for National Unity and Reconciliation. The\r\nmission of these two commissions is to promote the\r\npositive values of mutual respect and national reconciliation\r\nwhich, along with education in participatory democracy, are\r\nthe top priorities for the people of Rwanda.\r\nConcerning the democratization of our institutions, it\r\nis a pleasure for me to announce from this rostrum that the\r\ndemocratization process has started, with local elections,\r\nwhich should ensure, more than before, participation by the\r\npopulation in managing the business of the State. This\r\nprocess also has on its agenda the purpose of giving young\r\npeople and women a greater role in that management.\r\nThe United Nations has a Charter whose principles\r\nand purposes serve to guide us towards a world of\r\nsolidarity, of harmony and security. But there have been\r\nmany failures despite our common aspirations to peace.\r\nThis is sufficient proof that the way in which our\r\nOrganization is functioning betrays its very reason for\r\nexistence. That is why, during this session, many\r\ndelegations — and particularly the current President of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), Mr. Abdelaziz\r\nBouteflika — have shown that reform of the United\r\nNations and, more particularly, of the Security Council is\r\nboth necessary and urgent. We join those delegations that\r\nhave already spoken in favour of this long-awaited reform.\r\nA few moments ago I referred to the great\r\nachievements of science. Here, I could not fail to mention\r\nthe concept of globalization. Convinced of the benefits of\r\ntrade and between peoples, we in Rwanda believe that\r\nthis new system brings with it new hopes. Nevertheless,\r\nwe fear that the structural differences between our various\r\neconomies will require altering the expectations of our\r\npeoples, whom globalization is supposed to serve. We\r\ntherefore believe that the effectiveness of globalization\r\nwill be measured in terms of how it contributes to\r\nresolving such sensitive questions as the poverty\r\neradication, the debt burden, and peace and security.\r\nAnother factor for the success of globalization is the\r\nestablishment of viable regional economic arrangements\r\nthrough integration based on cooperation between\r\ndeveloping countries. We are happy that Africa has\r\nalready started to move in this direction, whether within\r\nOAU or the African Economic Community or in\r\nsubregional organizations. We are very pleased also to\r\nnote the contribution of the economic organizations in\r\nAfrica, not only to the development effort but also to\r\nconflict prevention and resolution.\r\nIn this connection we applaud the role the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) countries have\r\nplayed in preventing and resolving conflicts in the\r\nsubregion. We likewise applaud the regional and bilateral\r\ninitiatives that have given rise to such great hopes for\r\npeace, particularly in West Africa, in the Horn of Africa,\r\nin the Middle East between Israel and Palestine, in East\r\nTimor and in the Balkan region. We do earnestly request\r\nthe international community to support these efforts.\r\nI particularly applaud the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the resolve he has shown in increasing the\r\nefficiency of the United Nations in the area of peace and\r\ninternational security. The delegation of Rwanda, for its\r\npart, contributed to the discussions of the Security\r\nCouncil on 17 and 30 September this year (S/PV.4046\r\n(Resumption 1) and S/PV.4049 (Resumption 2)), on\r\nconflict in Africa. In this respect, my delegation truly\r\nappreciates the very important contribution of the\r\nPresident of Zambia, Frederick Chiluba, in Security\r\nCouncil discussions (S/PV.4047).\r\nThe Agreement on a ceasefire in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Congo signed in Lusaka on 10 July 1999\r\n(S/1999/815) is a commitment by the signatories to\r\nrespect and participate fully in the peace process. Two\r\nimportant clauses support this agreement: first, the clause\r\non inter-Congolese political negotiations towards a new\r\n28\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\npolitical order in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\r\nand secondly, the clause on pursuing and disarming the\r\narmed groups, including former Rwandan soldiers and the\r\nInterahamwe militias who perpetrated the genocide of 1994\r\nand later became integrated into the army of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The Agreement also\r\nprovides for various methods by which it is to be put into\r\neffect, and also contains clauses that will help preserve it in\r\nboth spirit and letter.\r\nIn this respect, I recall that subparagraph b of\r\nparagraph 2 of article 1 of the Agreement requires the\r\nsignatories parties to cease hostile propaganda; the goal is\r\nto ensure that the Ceasefire Agreement is respected.\r\nNevertheless, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Mr. Ndombasi, from\r\nthis rostrum, violently attacked my country, Rwanda. There\r\nis no need for me to revisit those outrageous accusations,\r\nbecause our representative has had the occasion to explain\r\nour intervention in the crisis in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo. I simply wish to respond to one of his concerns,\r\nmany times repeated in his statement.\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo several times over asked this\r\nAssembly to intercede with Rwanda so that Rwanda\r\nwithdraws from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nBy way of response, I declare before this Assembly\r\nthat Rwanda welcomes and supports the outcome of the\r\nAfrican initiative and urges the international community to\r\ngive its unconditional support to the implementation of the\r\nterms of this Agreement by all the parties, which must\r\nrefrain from any violation of the ceasefire. Unfortunately,\r\nwe are receiving news that the contrary is happening, for\r\nthose who call for implementation of the ceasefire are the\r\nfirst to violate it.\r\nNr. Jusys (Lithuania), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nFor two years already, the Kinshasa Government has\r\nbeen training, equipping and enrolling in its own army ex-\r\nofficers of the former Rwandan armed forces who\r\ncommitted acts of genocide and should be prosecuted.\r\nFurthermore, these officers, who directed the genocide, are\r\non the headquarters staff of the army of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. As the representative of Burundi\r\nhas just said, these armed elements are fomenting insecurity\r\nand propagating the idea of genocide throughout the region.\r\nNow that the Lusaka Agreement has been signed by\r\nall the parties to the conflict, we dare to hope that a United\r\nNations peacekeeping force will be deployed as soon as\r\npossible, and that soon peace will reign in our subregion.\r\nMay this Agreement enjoy the full support of the entire\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nFirst Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kyrgyzstan,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alikbek Djekshenkulov.\r\nMr. Djekshenkulov (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in\r\nRussian): First of all, I would like on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Kyrgyz Republic to congratulate Mr.\r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab on his election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the current session. We hope that,\r\nas a result of his great experience, our work during this\r\nsession will be successful.\r\nAt the threshold of the third millennium a most\r\npressing issue is facing humanity: the establishment of the\r\nnew world order, which will affect the nature of the\r\nworld in the future. The issue concerns all members of\r\nthe international community, regardless of their place or\r\nthe role they play in international relations.\r\nThe continuing threat of the proliferation of weapons\r\nof mass destruction; problems involving the protection of\r\nthe environment; technological and natural disasters;\r\nunresolved conflicts, terrorism and all forms of\r\nextremism, illegal trafficking in narcotics; the arms\r\ntrade — these are serious sources of tension throughout\r\nthe world. Recent events related to the settlement of the\r\nproblem of Kosovo are another reminder of the huge\r\nprice that continues to be paid in human suffering.\r\nKyrgyzstan is striving to make a positive\r\ncontribution to the achievement of the global goal of\r\nestablishing a new world order founded on security,\r\nstability and prosperity. We wish to demonstrate to the\r\ninternational community our commitment to such\r\nuniversal principles as democracy, respect for human\r\nrights, support for market economies, the pursuit of good-\r\nneighbourly relations, stability and security — not only in\r\nour region but throughout the world.\r\nThe years since our independence have convinced us\r\nthat for Kyrgyzstan there is no more rational foreign\r\npolicy than a balanced, multipolar approach focusing on\r\nthe development of friendly, consistent relations both with\r\nStates that play an important role in regional and world\r\naffairs and with those in which our country shares\r\npragmatic interests.\r\n29\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nAmong the major international events for the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic in recent years I wish to mention the admission of\r\nour country into the World Trade Organization; the\r\nadoption, at the fifty-third session of the General Assembly,\r\nof a resolution — resolution 53/24 — proclaiming the year\r\n2002 as the International Year of Mountains; and the\r\nelaboration by Askar Akayev, President of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic, of the Silk Road diplomacy doctrine.\r\nPresident Akayev\u0027s Silk Road foreign policy is based\r\non the ideas of global interdependence and of reviving the\r\nSilk Road as a bridge joining countries and civilizations so\r\nas to develop in the third millennium an intensive,\r\nmultilevel, multifaceted system of communication between\r\ncivilizations. It is no accident that the philosophy behind\r\nthe Silk Road diplomacy doctrine carries over to the\r\nRepublic\u0027s other foreign policy initiatives of recent years.\r\nThese include the holding in Kyrgyzstan, under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations, of an international conference on\r\nAfghanistan; the proclamation of the year 2002 as the\r\nInternational Year of Mountains; and the active\r\nparticipation of Kyrgyzstan in the establishment of a\r\nCentral Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nIn particular, enshrined in the doctrine is the idea that,\r\ngiven the current situation, reliable and dynamic political\r\nand commercial relations cannot be established without the\r\nstrengthening of multilateral relations of mutual cooperation\r\nand trust between all the States of the region. The Silk\r\nRoad policy requires Kyrgyzstan to establish and develop\r\nas fully as possible such relations with the countries of\r\nCentral Asia in all sectors and cooperative areas, including\r\nthe maintenance of regional and global security.\r\nThe mutual cooperation of China, Kazakhstan,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan within the framework of\r\nwhat is called the Shanghai Five is one of the most positive\r\nfactors for the maintenance of security in Central Asia, and\r\nfor Central Asia\u0027s development, and for its transformation\r\ninto a region of peace, good-neighbourly relations and\r\nprosperity. Since the first meeting of the heads of State of\r\nthe Shanghai Five and the signing of the agreement on\r\nconfidence-building in connection with military activities in\r\nthe border areas, the countries involved have, through\r\nfriendly consultations, been able to generally settle border\r\nissues and reduce the armed forces present in the border\r\nareas. We have established and strengthened cooperation\r\nand with it increased security, peace and calm along the\r\nborders.\r\nFrom 24 to 25 August 1999, in Bishkek, the fourth\r\nsummit of the heads of State of the Shanghai Five took\r\nplace. As participants pointed out, we are now seeing a\r\ntransformation among the Shanghai Five. Whereas in the\r\npast the group focused on military and political\r\ncooperation, now it is defining major directions for trade\r\nand economic cooperation. The role of the Bishkek\r\nsummit in this context was to transform these\r\nunderstandings into practical actions.\r\nIt is necessary specifically to point out the unique\r\nformat of the five in the context of which countries of\r\nvarying size, with different state systems, levels of\r\neconomic development and military strength are\r\ncooperating. A concrete demonstration of this was the\r\nsigning in Bishkek of an additional border agreement\r\nbetween China and Kyrgyzstan, which effectively\r\nremoved from the agenda the question of inter-State\r\ndemarcation and established a real basis for the\r\ntransformation of the Kyrgyzstan-China border into a\r\nborder of peace and mutual cooperation in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nKyrgyzstan continues to participate actively in the\r\nprocess of creating a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central\r\nAsia. An important role in the successful implementation\r\nof this initiative is being played by the consultative\r\nmeeting of experts of regional countries, held under\r\nUnited Nations auspices. We feel that the rapid\r\nconversion of Central Asia into a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone is becoming a multidimensional issue, since the\r\nachievement of this goal will favour profound positive\r\nprogress on the global, regional and subregional levels, as\r\nwell as in the area of bilateral relations between the\r\ncountries of our region. It will also be in harmony with\r\nthe world community\u0027s aspirations to establish a safe\r\nnuclear-free future.\r\nAs is well known, dramatic events have recently\r\ntaken place in southern Kyrgyzstan in connection with the\r\nincursion into Kyrgyz territory of well-armed bandit\r\ngroups of international terrorists with many years of\r\nexperience fighting in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. As a\r\nresult of the illegal actions of these terrorists, who are\r\nmembers of the implacable radical wing of Islamic\r\nextremism, a tense situation has emerged in the Batken\r\nand Chon-Alai areas of Osh Province. International\r\nterrorists have behaved barbarically, taking foreign\r\nhostages and murdering peaceful citizens. The bandits and\r\nthe forces behind them have made brazen, arrogant and\r\nfar-reaching attempts to impose their extremist views on\r\nthe country and have decisively and irrevocably chosen\r\nthe path of attacking peaceful democratic States and\r\neconomic and social reforms. They have threatened the\r\n30\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nsecurity and destroyed the tranquility of each and every\r\nState of Central Asia.\r\nWe are deeply concerned at having to confront such\r\nphenomena as the internationalization of Islamic extremism.\r\nAmong the terrorists invading our country, we have\r\nobserved not only representatives of States of Central Asia,\r\nbut also foreign mercenaries. Events in southern Kyrgyzstan\r\nand in Dagestan, Russia, are links in the same chain, forged\r\nby international Islamic extremists seeking their own\r\ncriminal objectives. These international bandits seek refuge\r\nbehind the noble values of Islam, which they roughly flout,\r\nsowing death and suffering among peaceful populations.\r\nI wish to stress in particular the staunch and\r\ncommitted support of our friendly neighbours — including\r\nKazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Russia — for\r\nKyrgyzstan\u0027s efforts to eradicate these bandit groups. The\r\nStates of the region have shown the international\r\ncommunity their firm desire to work together and to\r\ncoordinate their efforts in confronting international\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn turn, Kyrgyzstan expresses its deep-seated hope for\r\nreciprocal support from the world community in its struggle\r\nagainst international terrorism, which is a worldwide threat.\r\nIn this context, Kyrgyzstan highly commends the support\r\nand solidarity of the States members of the Conference on\r\nInteraction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia,\r\nmeeting at the level of Foreign Ministers in Almaty on 14\r\nSeptember. The Conference adopted a joint declaration on\r\nthe situation in Kyrgyzstan in which it condemned the\r\ncriminal activities of terrorists and expressed solidarity and\r\nsupport for my Government\u0027s fight against terrorism.\r\nThe criminal acts of international terrorists in southern\r\nKyrgyzstan have reinforced the need for a speedy\r\nsettlement of the armed conflict in Afghanistan. It is\r\nbecoming ever more apparent that the designs of the\r\nIslamic extremists based in Afghanistan and of the forces\r\nbehind them are spreading their destabilizing influence\r\nthroughout Central Asia through terror, murder, hostage-\r\ntaking and drug and weapons trafficking. In this connection,\r\nI wish particularly to point out that the ongoing illegal\r\ntransshipment of narcotics from Afghanistan across the\r\nterritories of the Central Asian countries is a primary source\r\nof financing for the criminal activities of the Islamic\r\nextremists. We feel that the world community must take the\r\nmost decisive measures to prevent these Islamic extremists\r\nfrom sowing violence, chaos and triumphal obscurantism in\r\nCentral Asia.\r\nKyrgyzstan intends broadly to support the efforts of\r\nthe international community in the context of the “six\r\nplus two” group. In turn, striving to make our own\r\ncontribution to the early settlement of the internal\r\nAfghanistan conflict, which has become a breeding\r\nground for Islamic extremism in the region, our country\r\nis ready to provide facilities for the convening, under\r\nUnited Nations auspices, of a conference on peace in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nHighly appreciating the importance to the\r\ninternational community of the United Nations as a\r\nuniversal Organization, Kyrgyzstan is profoundly\r\ninterested in the successful reform of its work. We\r\nsupport comprehensive reform, which should encompass\r\nall the organs of the United Nations, including the\r\nSecurity Council, which must vigorously address all\r\naspects of human development. The Kyrgyz Republic\r\nconfirms its view of the need to expand Security Council\r\nmembership and is also in favour of equitable\r\ngeographical representation in both categories.\r\nThere is no doubt that the process of reforming the\r\nUnited Nations should reflect upon the work of all its\r\nagencies. In our country today, we are seeing the\r\nsuccessful work of such United Nations specialized\r\nagencies as the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund, the United\r\nNations Population Fund, the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and others. We feel that\r\neffectiveness and results are the main criteria in assessing\r\ntheir work. It is necessary to give heightened attention to\r\nthe work of those agencies from which we can obtain\r\nmaximum output. In this connection, there needs to be\r\nmore active efforts to enhance the quality of work to\r\nimplement concrete measures designed to resolve socio-\r\neconomic, cultural, humanitarian and legal issues.\r\nIn this respect, I wish to highlight the important role\r\nplayed by UNDP, as the Organization\u0027s basic financing\r\nand coordination agency, to strengthen United Nations\r\ndevelopment efforts in such countries as Kyrgyzstan. In\r\n1998, Kyrgyzstan became a pilot country in UNDP\u0027s new\r\nresult-based approach. The results of the work of this\r\nsystem, which have been mainstreamed in all UNDP\r\noffices and headquarters, are being planned for use in a\r\nmulti-year funding framework. We hope that this system\r\nwill become an effective means of attracting additional\r\nfunding. In this connection, we cannot fail to be\r\nconcerned by the reduction in and unpredictability of\r\nUNDP core resources. We wish to appeal from this\r\nrostrum to the Governments of donor countries to\r\n31\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nundertake to study closely the possibility of increasing,\r\nthrough UNDP, their assistance to States with economies in\r\ntransition.\r\nIn this difficult period for countries such as my own,\r\nassistance rendered through UNDP and other specialized\r\nagencies is an important factor in the strengthening of our\r\nindependence, stability and progress.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to stress Kyrgyzstan\u0027s readiness\r\nto cooperate with all Members of the United Nations in\r\nachieving progress on a broad number of issues on the\r\nagenda of this final session of the millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Liberia, His Excellency Mr.\r\nMonie Captan.\r\nMr. Captan (Liberia): On the occasion of the fifty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly, marking our last\r\nmeeting in this century, I am humbled to address this body\r\non behalf of President Charles Ghankay Taylor, the\r\nGovernment and the people of Liberia.\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate the President\r\nmost cordially on his election to preside over this fifty-\r\nfourth session and to assure him of my delegation’s support\r\nand cooperation during the session. When we give\r\nconsideration to the scope of his diplomatic experience, the\r\nexpanse of his wisdom and the integrity of his heart, we\r\ncan only conclude that this is his hour, when his\r\nqualifications bespeak eloquently his ability to preside over\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nI recall my country’s involvement in the struggle for\r\nNamibia’s independence, and I am proud that, just about a\r\ndecade after achieving independence through the sustained\r\ndiplomacy of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\r\nthe United Nations, Namibia is serving in such a high\r\ncapacity. Significantly, it presides over the agenda of the\r\nlast session of the General Assembly of the twentieth\r\ncentury, where constructive discourse on new paradigms for\r\npeace, development and social progress will shape the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nI pay tribute to Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay. We\r\nhave witnessed his many attributes, especially his wise\r\nstewardship of the fifty-third session, which has laid the\r\nbasis for this one. I therefore offer to Mr. Opertti best\r\nwishes in his future callings.\r\nFor many reasons, I would like to express special\r\nappreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan. My focus is on his innovative leadership at\r\nthe helm of this world body. In particular, I note that only\r\ntwo years since his introduction of system-wide reforms\r\nthe Organization has been geared in the direction of\r\nrendering improved and better services and better\r\nhandling of world situations. We recollect the happy\r\nmoments of his visit in July to Liberia, which gave\r\nfurther testimony to the Secretary-General’s commitment\r\nto solving the problems of Africa. The Government and\r\npeople of Liberia are deeply proud that the United\r\nNations leadership has focused on the search for sustained\r\npeace in our region, especially in the work of the United\r\nNations Peace-building Support Office in Liberia, which\r\nhas been instrumental in the consolidation of peace in\r\nLiberia.\r\nWe heartily welcome the admission of three new\r\nmembers: the Kingdom of Tonga, the Republic of Nauru\r\nand the Republic of Kiribati. We look forward to their\r\ncontribution to the ideals of the United Nations.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that the inflexible attitudes\r\ngenerated by the cold war have been superseded by\r\ndialogue. For the promise of a better future, innovative\r\nand alternative efforts are required in all areas of human\r\nendeavour. Accordingly, the world is experiencing a\r\ntransformation in international relations. At the dawn of\r\na new millennium, we are moving from confrontation to\r\ncooperation. Nation States continue their search within\r\nsubregional organizations for the stabilization of civil\r\norder, the elimination of human suffering and the\r\nmaintenance of peace. Liberia reaffirms its commitment\r\nto the concept of world peace that is sustainable in\r\ncontext and global in approach. Hence, we believe that\r\nequal treatment should be accorded to all conflicts,\r\nwherever they might occur.\r\nLiberia takes a dim view of the disparity in the\r\nresources committed by the Security Council to the\r\nconflicts in Kosovo and East Timor, on the one hand, and\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the other.\r\nRegarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia\r\ncommends President Chiluba of Zambia for his mediatory\r\nrole, which led to the signing of the Lusaka Agreement\r\nby all the concerned parties. We endorse his recent\r\nrequest to the Security Council that it authorize and\r\nsupport the deployment of a peacekeeping force in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, with an appropriate\r\nmandate.\r\n32\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nFollowing the relaxation of tension in international\r\nrelations, there should be a renewed determination on the\r\npart of us all to search for creative avenues to resolve civil\r\nconflicts and promote regional, political and economic\r\ncooperation for the prosperity of all peoples.\r\nAt the onset of his assumption of national leadership,\r\nfollowing free and fair elections, President Charles Taylor\r\nembarked upon sound programmes aimed at achieving\r\nnational reconciliation, the resettlement of all refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons, the rehabilitation and the\r\nreintegration of ex-combatants and reconstruction. Not only\r\nis our Government making every effort to achieve these\r\nspecific goals; we are also committed to improving the\r\nquality of life of our people.\r\nIn this regard, President Taylor’s Administration\r\nremains committed to three cardinal principles: ensuring\r\nnational unity through national reconciliation, resettlement\r\nand reconstruction; good governance through accountability,\r\nefficiency and transparency; and the guaranteed protection\r\nof human rights.\r\nRegarding good governance, I should like to state that\r\nmechanisms for revenue collection have improved and\r\nexpenditure has been strictly controlled to ensure prudent\r\nfiscal and monetary management and public accountability.\r\nOur human rights record has improved tremendously and\r\nremains the focal point in our continued efforts to meet the\r\nchallenges of national reconciliation. In furtherance of this\r\nobjective, President Taylor holds regular consultations with\r\nleaders of the opposition, civil society, religious groups and\r\nthe media on matters of national interest.\r\nI should also mention that in response to President\r\nTaylor’s policy of inclusion, opposition political leaders in\r\nMay this year toured the United States and certain\r\nEuropean capitals to further sensitize the international\r\ncommunity and donor Governments to post-conflict\r\nproblems confronting Liberia and to seek assistance.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his statement to the fourth\r\nMinisterial Meeting of the ad hoc Special Conference on\r\nLiberia, held on 3 October 1997, highlighted the\r\nGovernment’s commitment to national reconstruction. He\r\nurged the international community to render necessary\r\nassistance to achieve this goal. Accordingly, a donors’\r\nconference on Liberia was held in Paris, France, in April\r\n1998. The amount of $230 million was pledged for\r\nLiberia’s national reconstruction programme. However, it is\r\ndisheartening to note that donors have not yet honoured\r\ntheir commitments. We earnestly appeal to them to give\r\nhumane consideration to the difficult circumstances of\r\npost-conflict reconstruction. We are eager to rejuvenate\r\nthe economy, revitalize productive activities, restore the\r\nsocial infrastructure and improve the standard of living\r\nfor all Liberians. Unfortunately, these efforts cannot be\r\nlaunched without support and assistance from the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe evolving trends of globalization pose enormous\r\nthreats to weak and vulnerable nations, which are\r\ncontinuously marginalized in a global economic system.\r\nFor most developing countries, particularly the least\r\ndeveloped countries, which include Liberia, the debt\r\noverhang and the unequal levels of trade are perennial\r\nproblems for their socio-economic development and\r\nreintegration into the world economy.\r\nThe huge debt burden inherited by Liberia remains\r\na major obstacle in our post-war reconstruction efforts.\r\nOur debt stock is $3 billion. This means that each\r\nLiberian man, woman and child carries a debt burden of\r\n$1,200. In a country where the per capita income is\r\nbarely $275 it may never be possible to fully repay this\r\ncolossal financial obligation. Additionally, the cost of\r\nrehabilitation and resettlement makes it imperative that\r\nconsideration be given to our request for debt relief. We\r\nare continuously undertaking economic reforms to deal\r\nwith the massive demands of our people and the\r\ninternational community. In view of all that, we call on\r\nour creditors to consider relieving Liberia of this\r\nenormous financial burden.\r\nDebt relief should be considered on a humanitarian\r\nbasis against the background that such a move would\r\nconsolidate existing peace, enhance rehabilitation and\r\nfoster social and political stability. We believe that it\r\nwould be supportive of Liberia’s desire for inclusion in\r\nthe evolving global economy.\r\nThe resolution of the Liberian civil crisis would not\r\nhave been possible without the close cooperation that\r\nexisted between the international community and the\r\nLiberian people. We believe that the high level of\r\ncollaboration between Liberia and the international\r\ncommunity should continue to guide our future\r\nendeavours in post-conflict Liberia so that the gains made\r\nby all stakeholders will not be lost.\r\nOf major concern in our reconstruction, rehabilitation\r\nand healing programme is the condition of women and\r\nchildren, for no amount of planning for reconstruction can\r\never succeed if the plight of women and children is\r\n33\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nignored. Thus, we are implementing programmes that\r\nrefocus their emphasis towards pursuing educational\r\nopportunities and safeguarding the rights of women and\r\nchildren.\r\nOver the past two years Liberia has repeatedly sought\r\nthe lifting of the 1992 arms embargo imposed on it by the\r\nSecurity Council. Our request is based on a principled legal\r\nstance that the Liberian civil war, which had necessitated\r\nthe imposition of the embargo, effectively ended on 2\r\nAugust 1997 with the installation of a duly elected civilian\r\nGovernment. Thus, the intent of the arms embargo, which\r\nwas to contain the war and the proliferation of arms in\r\nLiberia, is no longer necessary.\r\nIn our submission to the Council requesting that the\r\nembargo be lifted, we referred to the 1996-1997 final\r\ncommuniqué of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), by which that regional organization\r\nlifted all sanctions and embargoes on Liberia and called\r\nupon the international community to do the same. It is\r\nimportant to note that it was ECOWAS that saw the need\r\nto impose an arms embargo on Liberia and to request the\r\ninternational community, including the Security Council, to\r\nsupport the embargo.\r\nThe Government of Liberia continues to stress that the\r\narms embargo presently imposed against Liberia by the\r\nSecurity Council is unjust. There are no defined criteria or\r\ntime limit for its lifting. It has been expanded in perpetuity\r\nwithout any explanation. The Government of Liberia\r\nreiterates that the continued refusal by the Security Council\r\nto lift the arms embargo is a clear infringement of Liberia\u0027s\r\nsovereignty, which the United Nations Charter defends.\r\nLike all Member States, Liberia has the unqualified right to\r\ndefend itself and all those within its borders. The attitude\r\nof the Council on this matter imputes partial sovereignty\r\nand has hindered the freedom of a Charter Member of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe arms embargo has created an imbalance, with the\r\npotential for adverse consequences for peace and security.\r\nThe substantial advance of the destruction of arms in\r\nLiberia was followed by cross-border aggression. The arms\r\nembargo on Liberia does not contribute to peace in the\r\nsubregion; rather, it contributes to a fragile situation of\r\ninsecurity and suspicion, which could lead to instability.\r\nSuch an untenable condition need not exist in a region with\r\na high population of refugees and former combatants,\r\npoverty and deteriorating socio-economic conditions.\r\nIn our continued efforts to prevent the proliferation\r\nof arms left over from the civil war, and to ensure\r\nregional peace and stability, on 25 July 1999 the\r\nGovernment of Liberia decided to destroy arms and\r\nammunition collected from the then warring parties during\r\nthe disarmament process. This destruction exercise is\r\nbeing carried out with the assistance of the United\r\nNations, ECOWAS and the United States Government.\r\nMost of the ammunition and arms have been destroyed.\r\nThe arms and ammunition destroyed as of 10 September\r\n1999 are as follows: 3,156,156 total rounds of\r\nammunition of all sizes and 19,297 total weapons of all\r\nsizes. Following are the categories of weapons that were\r\ndestroyed: 18,420 small arms; 626 heavy machine guns;\r\n150 anti-tank launchers; 63 mortars; 26 recoilless rifles;\r\n9 guns and howitzers; and 3 rocket launchers. The total\r\nis 19,297.\r\nThe destruction of these arms and ammunition does\r\nnot negate the necessity of lifting the arms embargo. The\r\nformer represents a clear departure from war mode to the\r\ninstitution of a culture of peace. The latter restores\r\nLiberia\u0027s sovereign right to equip and maintain a national\r\narmoury under the aegis of a restructured national army\r\nto ensure proper accountability and fulfil the elected\r\nGovernment\u0027s constitutional responsibility for national\r\nsecurity.\r\nLiberia\u0027s international efforts are geared towards\r\npeace and security, primarily in our subregion and\r\ngenerally in the world. Our stability is inextricably linked\r\nto security in the West African subregion. It is within this\r\ncontext that President Taylor took bold initiatives which\r\nsignificantly contributed to peace in Sierra Leone. Liberia\r\nalways felt that the conflict in Sierra Leone was primarily\r\ninternal. Our persistence to bring about a negotiated\r\nsettlement, rather than the use of force and violence,\r\nemanated from our national experience with the futility\r\nand destructiveness of armed confrontation.\r\nIn this connection, my Government participated in\r\nvarious talks, which led to the signing of the historic\r\nLomé Peace Agreement. Presently, Liberia is hosting two\r\nleaders of the Sierra Leonean conflict in Monrovia in\r\norder to resolve internal differences and facilitate their\r\nearly return to Freetown for the smooth implementation\r\nof the Agreement. My Government is genuinely\r\ncommitted to the Sierra Leonean peace process and will\r\ndo everything to ensure that peace and normalcy return to\r\nthat sister Republic.\r\n34\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nWe concur with the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nrecommendation to the Security Council on the\r\nestablishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force for\r\nSierra Leone; this, we believe, will sustain and strengthen\r\nthe efforts of ECOWAS.\r\nLiberia has been concerned about its borders with\r\nneighbouring countries, especially Guinea. We have\r\nwitnessed two incidents of armed aggression along our\r\nnorthern border, which resulted in the loss of life, property\r\nand the displacement of people. In this regard, we appeal to\r\nthe international community to provide us with all the\r\nnecessary assistance to enable our Government to cope with\r\nthe problems of refugees and internally displaced persons,\r\nas well as to address the humanitarian crises created as a\r\nresult of the attack by dissidents. We are indeed gratified\r\nthat the Secretary-General has added his voice to the appeal\r\nfor assistance.\r\nLiberia is committed to finding a diplomatic solution\r\nto the problem along the Guinea-Liberia border and\r\nreaffirms its adherence to the practice of good-\r\nneighbourliness. We call on the international community to\r\nduly consider the vulnerability of the subregion due to the\r\nlarge volume of refugees and the attendant humanitarian\r\ncrisis. My Government is of the strong conviction that\r\ndialogue and cooperation between and among neighbours\r\nwill enhance security, peace and stability in the subregion.\r\nAccordingly, at a mini-summit of the heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates, (ECOWAS) held in Abuja, Nigeria on 16 September\r\n1999, Liberia reached an understanding with Guinea\r\nrelative to security and cooperation. We therefore call on\r\nthe international community to lend its support to the\r\nefforts aimed at reactivating the Mano River Union.\r\nSince 1992, Africa has experienced numerous\r\nimpediments to its economic development. There has been\r\na continuous decline in its exports, imports and the flow of\r\ndirect foreign investment and overseas development\r\nassistance. This situation is compounded by the increasing\r\ndebt burden, estimated at $300 billion. These negative\r\ntrends hamper Africa\u0027s integration into the global economy,\r\nthus leading to its marginalization. We therefore call for the\r\ncreation of a more favourable economic environment that\r\ntaken into account the unique problems of Africa.\r\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General on the\r\nmeasures he has taken in helping create a favourable\r\neconomic environment for Africa, as outlined in his\r\n“Progress report on the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the report on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa” (S/1999/1008).\r\nFurthermore, we reaffirm our commitment to the\r\nprovisions of the Algiers Declaration of the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) with respect to the establishment\r\nof a genuine international partnership.\r\nWe welcome the offer of the United States President\r\nBill Clinton to forgive the debts of the world\u0027s poorest\r\ncountries, including Liberia.\r\nAs a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of\r\nthe Child, my Government has taken measures to improve\r\nthe environment for nurturing and developing the child.\r\nWe hereby reiterate our commitment to the rehabilitation\r\nand reintegration of children into civil society, in\r\naccordance with the Maputo Declaration adopted by the\r\nOAU. We therefore call upon the international community\r\nto provide support for efforts in this regard.\r\nLiberia firmly believes that the unification of China\r\nshould be peacefully pursued and that although it is a\r\nmatter for the Chinese people themselves to determine,\r\nthere is nonetheless a need for the United Nations to\r\nexamine the exceptional international situation pertaining\r\nto the Republic of China on Taiwan. In so doing it will\r\nensure that the fundamental rights of 22 million people to\r\nparticipate in the work and activities of the United\r\nNations, and it will do honour to this great world body.\r\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan has contributed\r\nsubstantially to the international community in the area of\r\ntechnical and development assistance and has shown a\r\nstrong commitment to human rights, democracy, market\r\neconomy and multilateralism. The unparalleled economic\r\nand political development of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan has brought a strong desire of its people to\r\nparticipate in international activities.\r\nResolution 2758 (XXVI), however, denies over 22\r\nmillion people their right to participate in United Nations\r\nactivities and contravenes the United Nations Charter\u0027s\r\nprinciple of universality. Taking into account the changing\r\ninternational climate, characterized by global economic\r\ninterdependence, it is essential for the United Nations to\r\nreview this unfair resolution as it steps into a new\r\ncentury. Liberia believes that the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan can play a more important and beneficial role in\r\nthe United Nations community and that it is willing to\r\nplay that role. Liberia strongly urges the United Nations\r\nto find a speedy and satisfactory resolution to the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan\u0027s participation in the United\r\nNations.\r\n35\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nIn conclusion, since its establishment, the United\r\nNations has represented mankind\u0027s legitimate aspirations.\r\nDespite its shortcomings, we continue to see it that way.\r\nLiberia cannot overemphasize its support for the ongoing\r\nreforms of the United Nations. Twenty-five years ago,\r\nLiberia called for a review of the United Nations Charter to\r\nensure its effectiveness to cope with some of the\r\nfundamental problems that continue to beset the world\r\ncommunity.\r\nAlthough we have not been favoured with the usual\r\nlevel of international support to help speed up the pace of\r\nprogress in rebuilding our country, Liberia is most grateful\r\nfor the vital support it has received, especially in the areas\r\nof rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants and\r\nresettlement of refugees and displaced persons. It may not\r\nbe intentional, but it is regrettable that the issue of African\r\nrefugees has received little attention from the international\r\ncommunity, as has the issue of the developmental needs of\r\nthe continent. The United Nations must ensure that on its\r\nagenda the treatment of refugees around the globe is not\r\nskewed unequally against a particular region.\r\nIf this world body will underline the promotion of\r\nsustainable development, the pursuit of global peace and the\r\nneed to safeguard human progress, and if we realize that in\r\norder to succeed we ought to rededicate ourselves to high\r\nand inspiring objectives, then we can truly ensure the future\r\nof all mankind, irrespective of our places of origin.\r\nIn Liberia, we have evolved four strategies for the new\r\nmillennium: first, to eradicate ignorance, disease —\r\nparticularly the HIV/AIDS pandemic — and poverty, and\r\nto promote human rights; secondly, to strengthen the full\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to effectively preserve the\r\ninternational system; thirdly, to promote universal harmony\r\nand globalization; and fourthly, to protect humankind\r\nagainst the scourge of nuclear, chemical and biological\r\nwarfare, and to preserve our ecosystem.\r\nAs we enter a new century, we need to re-evaluate our\r\nundertakings and take measures to improve conditions in\r\nour world with an unflinching respect for the dignity of\r\nhumankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Maldives, His Excellency Mr. Fathulla\r\nJameel.\r\nMr. Jameel (Maldives): At the outset, I would like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Gurirab on his election to preside over this\r\nhistoric session of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to\r\nhis rich experience and to his great country, Namibia.\r\nHis predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, also\r\ndeserves our appreciation for the excellent manner in\r\nwhich he discharged his important responsibilities.\r\nPermit me also to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication and\r\ncommitment to the ideals of the United Nations.\r\nAs we meet for the final session of this century, and,\r\nindeed, of this millennium, we are faced with a future that\r\nholds for us promises and perils, hopes and fears,\r\nopportunities and challenges. We cannot secure a better\r\nfuture unless the root causes of the problems of our times\r\nare resolved. The United Nations, as the only truly global\r\nOrganization, is best suited to address these problems. Its\r\nrole, therefore, must be reaffirmed and must remain\r\ncentral to our efforts in the reconstruction of a more just\r\nworld order where human security is guaranteed.\r\nSince the establishment of this Organization, small\r\nStates have earned a legitimate voice in multilateral\r\ndiplomacy. I am delighted today to welcome the three\r\nnew Members of the United Nations, the Republic of\r\nKiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of\r\nTonga. As small States, Maldives and the three new\r\nMembers share numerous interests and concerns which\r\nare vital to our common survival and progress.\r\nWe stand at a crossroads. This is an ideal\r\nopportunity to review our past performance and to map\r\nout innovative approaches to address existing and\r\nemerging problems. As we get ready to enter the new\r\ncentury and the new millennium, we in the Maldives have\r\ndeveloped Vision 2020 for our country, based on the\r\nlessons of the past. The Vision sets out major directions\r\nfor the next two decades. We envision a community that\r\nis just, caring and peaceful. Our country must continue to\r\nbe one in which good governance, democracy and the\r\nwelfare of the people are given the highest priority. We\r\nseek a society where gender equality is a reality and\r\nwhere everyone has the opportunity for self-actualization.\r\nWe want our children to be happy, creative and safe.\r\nThese aims can be realized only through a high level\r\nof economic achievement and social progress. However,\r\nour resources are meagre. We face numerous natural\r\nhazards and are vulnerable to a wide range of man-made\r\nthreats. Nevertheless, we remain firm in our determination\r\nto achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. But for\r\n36\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nthat to happen, our own efforts must be supplemented by a\r\nsupportive international environment. That much we need\r\nand that much we seek.\r\nNevertheless, the withdrawal of that supportive\r\nframework seems, regrettably, to be imminent. The\r\nMaldives has been earmarked for graduation from the list\r\nof least developed countries (LDC) next year. We do not\r\nfeel entirely comfortable with the LDC label. Indeed, we\r\nwould like to enter the new millennium as a self-reliant\r\ncountry. National pride, however, cannot transcend harsh\r\neconomic reality. Our economy is small and narrowly\r\nbased. Capacity for economic diversification in the\r\nimmediate future is limited. Graduation would therefore\r\nimpose unbearable burdens on us. The General Assembly\r\nis to review the graduation process and its criteria this year.\r\nI appeal to you to consider the realities on the ground. I\r\ncall upon you to look beyond abstract indicators to the\r\ninherent vulnerabilities of small States. My President has\r\nalready conveyed our concerns in detail to the President of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council. The Commonwealth has\r\nstrongly supported our case.\r\nThe liberalization of trade and the globalization of the\r\neconomy have created windows of opportunity for increased\r\neconomic growth. Their impact, though, has created a\r\nparticularly difficult economic road for developing\r\ncountries. Globalization must progress without\r\nmarginalization and without further impoverishment. The\r\nseven nations of the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation (SAARC) are working together to enhance our\r\nprospects in the new international economic climate through\r\ngreater regional cooperation.\r\nYet, ominously, on a global scale the gulf between\r\nrich and poor nations has reached tragic proportions. These\r\nharsh economic realities have been accompanied by the\r\nfragmentation of the international will to foster greater\r\nequality. Aid programmes had previously supplemented\r\ndomestic savings in recipient countries, but today they are\r\nnot even adequate to save the destitute, leaving many\r\ndeveloping countries with little choice but to replace their\r\nvisions of advancement with those of survival and life-\r\nsupport. The world\u0027s present focus on poverty eradication\r\nonly underscores its past failure to narrow the gap between\r\nthe rich and the poor. It is disheartening to note that the\r\ngap has more than doubled since 1950.\r\nI am happy that a number of international initiatives\r\non social issues have taken place during this decade. The\r\nMaldives attaches great importance to the fulfilment of the\r\nCopenhagen commitments and the implementation of the\r\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action. We look\r\nforward to their review meetings next year to give a fresh\r\nimpetus to our action. In South Asia, the Maldives has\r\ncalled for the drawing up of a social charter that will\r\ninstitutionalize social development in the region. We are\r\nalso pressing for a SAARC convention on regional\r\narrangements to promote and protect child welfare. I hope\r\nthat the convention will be adopted as we mark the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nThe international social agenda is indeed a\r\ndemanding one. It cannot be addressed by national\r\nGovernments acting alone. Cooperation among States and\r\npartnerships with inter-governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations are essential for victory on\r\nthis front. At the same time, our approach to economic\r\nperformance needs to be re-oriented towards human\r\nsecurity and ecological safety. We need to temper our\r\nobsession over economic growth with concerns for the\r\nquality of life. We all accept the importance of\r\nsustainable development. We all agree on the need for\r\neffective global action to achieve environment-friendly\r\nprogress. Yet, the clear message that has emerged from\r\nthe review of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\ncompleted this week is that of weak commitment and\r\npoor implementation. Our deeds must match the\r\nsentiments we have expressed. We must deliver on our\r\npromises.\r\nSmall island developing States have few options that\r\nthey can pursue on their own. International cooperation is\r\nvital to ensure that sustainable development strategies are\r\nviable for them. It is also necessary to help them adapt to\r\nthe dangers posed by global warming and climate change.\r\nAs we have reiterated on numerous occasions, the\r\nMaldives could very well cease to exist if the sea level\r\nrises by one metre. Many other low-lying regions would\r\nsuffer a similar fate. Should the sea level rise by one\r\nmetre, the developed countries too would be affected\r\nsignificantly, and the direct impact on biodiversity would\r\nbe unfathomable. The Maldives is therefore deeply\r\ndisappointed by the lack of action in implementing the\r\nBarbados pledges.\r\nWhile great Powers may be able to look after their\r\nown security needs, the small States need to rely on\r\ninstitutions of collective security. I am happy to recall that\r\n10 years ago, the Assembly adopted resolution 44/51,\r\nwhich recognized that the international community has an\r\nobligation to make provision for the protection and\r\nsecurity of small States. We are grateful for the support\r\n37\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nof the international community for our initiative on this\r\nissue, but we remain concerned that time and again the\r\nresponse of the United Nations to crises, especially those\r\ninvolving small States, has been found wanting in speed\r\nand in effectiveness.\r\nIt is a pity that we have to enter the new century and\r\nthe new millennium still carrying baggage containing many\r\nunresolved and deep-seated problems that confronted the\r\nUnited Nations at its birth.\r\nOne such problem is the Middle East problem. Peace\r\nin the Middle East still remains elusive. Hesitant steps have\r\nbeen taken, but many issues remain unresolved. The\r\nMaldives has welcomed the Middle East peace process\r\nfrom the beginning. We are disappointed at its slow\r\nprogress and look forward to a more earnest and bold\r\nsearch for peace. Once again, we express our full support\r\nto the Palestinian cause and call for the full implementation\r\nof the relevant United Nations resolutions on lasting peace\r\nin the region.\r\nEight years after the Gulf war, there are still many\r\nunresolved issues that affect the security and progress of\r\nthe region. The Maldives calls upon all parties concerned\r\nto fully comply with the resolutions of the United Nations\r\non the subject. We regret the suspension of talks between\r\nKuwait and Iraq on outstanding bilateral issues, including\r\nthat of missing persons, and believe that the resolution of\r\nthese issues should be pursued within the existing\r\nframework of relevant United Nations resolutions. The\r\nMaldives reaffirms its unwavering support for the\r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nKuwait. We reiterate our belief that the United Nations has\r\nan obligation to uphold the security and territorial integrity\r\nof all Member States, including smaller States.\r\nThe post-cold-war years have seen the bitter betrayal\r\nof the promise of greater freedom and development. Rather\r\nthan seeing a celebration of human rights and the legitimate\r\nrights of communities to their own identity and cultural\r\nvalues, arrogant ethnocentrism and intolerance appear to be\r\nrampant. Indeed, the violent disintegration of States and\r\ncivil wars have led to the most gruesome crimes against\r\nhumanity. Genuine aspirations have often been met with\r\nbrutal force, as in Bosnia and Kosovo. Protracted disputes,\r\nsuch as in Kashmir, are continuing to exact a high price in\r\nhuman lives and constantly endanger security at both the\r\nregional and international levels.\r\nStrategies of nuclear deterrence which presumably rely\r\non the credible threat of mass destruction cannot be\r\njustified on moral grounds. We welcome the steps that are\r\nbeing taken to increase nuclear safety. We continue to be\r\nalarmed by the increased risk of nuclear war that\r\naccompanies proliferation. The Maldives is a staunch\r\nsupporter of non-proliferation. We firmly believe that the\r\nworld will be a safer place without nuclear weapons. We\r\nhope that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) review process will find ways to achieve\r\nprogress in all aspects of the non-proliferation regime.\r\nThe continuation of many conflicts and the flaring\r\nup of others call into question the efficacy of this\r\nOrganization. It is not only the passage of time that\r\ndemands the reform and restructuring of the United\r\nNations. The most persuasive argument is the urgent need\r\nto increase the ability of the United Nations to realize the\r\nobjectives for which it has been set up. Whatever reform\r\nis undertaken should be instrumental in that sense.\r\nReform must enhance its legitimacy. Reform must make\r\nthe United Nations more democratic and transparent, and\r\nit must also reinforce the United Nations ability to uphold\r\nequality among nations.\r\nAs we step into the new century, the world has\r\nreached a major turning point. We are bidding farewell to\r\none millennium and are marching with determination into\r\na new one. It is one in which a stronger commitment to\r\nmultilateralism will be essential. Many of the hazards that\r\nwe are faced with do not recognize national borders. The\r\nworld has become closely integrated, and communities\r\nhave become highly interwoven across national frontiers,\r\nnecessitating global approaches to global problems.\r\nAdvances in science and technology give us cause for\r\noptimism in our efforts to overcome several of the\r\nchallenges that confront us today. These are assisted by\r\nnew mindsets of cooperation and emotional intelligence.\r\nWe need to nurture the positive strands and prune the\r\nnegative. Yet the new century will not usher in a new age\r\nunless hope and progress become universal.\r\nThe new millennium will not set an enlightened\r\ncourse for world politics until right can triumph over\r\nmight and double standards give way to justice for all.\r\nThat is the millennium challenge.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\n38\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nMay I remind members that statements in exercise of\r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first\r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second intervention\r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Akinsanya (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation\r\nlistened attentively to the comments made by our brother,\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cameroon, regarding\r\ntheir maritime border dispute with Nigeria.\r\nVery often silence can be mistaken for acquiescence,\r\nhence this response. We are surprised indeed that the\r\nmatter, which is currently before the International Court of\r\nJustice and should therefore be regarded as sub judice, has\r\nnonetheless been raised in this forum.\r\nAs a respectable member of the international\r\ncommunity, Nigeria continues to explore and pursue peace\r\nand the amicable settlement of disputes. This is consistent\r\nwith our track record in our subregion as well as elsewhere\r\nin the world, a record which many delegations have warmly\r\nacknowledged, even in the course of this session.\r\nNigeria maintains, and will continue to maintain,\r\nexcellent relations with all nations, starting with those in\r\nour subregion, and our neighbours, including the Republic\r\nof Cameroon. Nigeria does not have any territorial ambition\r\nagainst any country. It is for these reasons that we refuse to\r\nbe drawn into unnecessary altercations with Cameroon,\r\nespecially as we are confident that justice will prevail in\r\ntime.\r\nNigeria, like any other sovereign nation, reserves the\r\nright to deploy its armed forces on its own territory in order\r\nto protect and secure its borders, so the question of\r\nwithdrawing such forces should therefore not arise.\r\nThe other issues raised by the Foreign Minister of\r\nCameroon are matters which are being determined through\r\njudicial processes. They therefore do not warrant a response\r\nfrom us in this forum.\r\nFinally, let me state that Nigeria is firmly committed\r\nto the pursuit of peaceful and amicable solutions to\r\ndisputes.\r\nMr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (spoke\r\nin French): Once again today the representatives of Rwanda\r\nand of Burundi have been talking nonsense and telling\r\nunspeakable lies about the dreadful role their countries are\r\nplaying through their senseless and unjust invasion of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Their statements do not\r\nmerit any comment by my delegation. Furthermore, all\r\nthey are doing is distracting the attention and insulting the\r\nintelligence of the members of the Assembly.\r\nMy delegation recalls that Mr. Yerodia Abdoulaye\r\nNdombasi, our Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation and head of our delegation\r\nduring this session of the Assembly, has already\r\nexplained, clearly and eloquently, the tragic situation in\r\nmy country now. However, my delegation had hoped that\r\nthe delegation of Rwanda in particular had come before\r\nus today with a message of peace. Not at all: on the\r\ncontrary, only a few hours ago, Rwandan troops again\r\nlaunched a major offensive against Kabinda, a town about\r\n180 kilometres south-east of the diamond town of Mbuji-\r\nMayi. This is the umpteenth violation of the Ceasefire\r\nAgreement signed in Lusaka by all the parties, it is\r\nintolerable and it is absolutely unacceptable.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet us be very, very clear. What do the Congolese\r\npeople want? We want the Rwandans — all of them —\r\nout of the Congo. We want the Ugandans out of the\r\nCongo. We want the Burundians out of the Congo. That\r\nis the bottom line. We invite all of them, along with their\r\nnon-invited military forces, to return peacefully to their\r\nrespective countries, using the same paths and roads that\r\nthey took when they invaded the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe rest is literature, the rest is history, a tragic\r\nhistory, written in blood and engraved with the suffering\r\nof innocent Congolese victims, who are paying heavily\r\nfor the irredentist aims of the aggressors — veritable\r\nmodern-day Attilas. Our Government and people are\r\ndetermined to defend every last inch, and every last\r\nparcel of its land — even if it means making the supreme\r\nsacrifice — to preserve our independence and\r\nsovereignty.\r\nMy Government once again calls on the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity and the United Nations urgently to make\r\nevery possible effort to find, as soon as possible, a\r\npeaceful and lasting solution for the whole of the Great\r\nLakes region. If this explosive situation is not given the\r\nattention that it continues to need, the international\r\ncommunity, through its silence and timid response, which\r\nis unequal to the seriousness of the violations of\r\n39\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\ninternational law taking place on the ground, will have on\r\nits conscience the responsibility for the imminent\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe. My country, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, continues and will continue to\r\nsound the alarm so that the international community is kept\r\nabreast of events and actually shoulders all its\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nMr. Mwandembwa (United Republic of Tanzania): In\r\nits earlier statement, the Republic of Burundi alleged that\r\nTanzania harbours rebels from Burundi, or Burundi rebel\r\nbases, in its territory. I would like to put the record straight\r\nby stating categorically that the Government of the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania has never had, and does not now\r\nhave, any Burundi rebel bases inside its territory. Tanzania\r\nhas a lot of refugee camps. Tanzania also admits that it has\r\nbeen receiving a lot of refugees from the Republic of\r\nBurundi, and we have placed the refugees in those camps.\r\nBut the camps cannot be regarded as rebel bases, because\r\nthey are under the supervision of the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, which can\r\nconfirm that they are not being used by Burundi rebels as\r\nbases.\r\nMr. Kouomegni (Cameroon) (spoke in French): As I\r\nstated a little while ago, Cameroon believes that the\r\npositive winds of change blowing at present through the\r\ninstitutions of Nigeria with the advent of a democratically\r\nelected Government have greatly raised the hopes of many\r\npeople, including the people of Cameroon, who are\r\nespecially hopeful for a peaceful resolution of crisis we\r\nface on our borders on land and sea.\r\nHowever, the delegation of Cameroon is duty-bound\r\nto inform the General Assembly and the United Nations\r\nabout a number of worrying facts. Since I have been here\r\nin the General Assembly Hall, my Government has\r\ninformed me about incidents that have taken place on our\r\ncommon border, incidents initiated by the armed forces of\r\nNigeria. I was to sign a note verbale of protest stating the\r\nvarious points where the incidents took place.\r\nI should like to add that the Government of Nigeria\r\nwhich, like Cameroon, had accepted the binding jurisdiction\r\nof the International Court of Justice at The Hague, has just\r\nstated that it has reservations regarding that acceptance.\r\nThis means, to put it in clear, that if we have a specific\r\ndispute with Nigeria, particularly about issues relating to\r\nthe other parts of our border that are still causing\r\ndifficulties, we will not be able to bring it before the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. And that means that if we\r\nhave other conflicts, force may be the only way to find a\r\nsolution.\r\nFurthermore, we continue to note that some high-\r\nranking leaders in Nigeria — not necessarily the\r\nhighest — are giving interviews, talking to the press and\r\nletting it be known that, whatever the International Court\r\nof Justice may decide, there is no way that the territory of\r\nBakassi, which is part of Cameroon, is going to be given\r\nback.\r\nSo there are some very worrying facts, but we are\r\nsaying that there is a good wind blowing in Nigeria,\r\nNigeria is returning normally to the international scene.\r\nHowever, we believe that in doing so Nigeria should\r\nrespect the principles and norms of the international\r\nsociety to which it is returning.\r\nMr. Mutaboba (Rwanda): In keeping with the letter\r\nand the spirit of the Lusaka Agreement, my delegation\r\nwill not waste the precious time of the General Assembly\r\nby responding once more to the baseless allegations and\r\nlucubrations of the delegation of the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo. I wish therefore to invite Member States to\r\nrefer to the facts contained in my delegation’s previous\r\nstatement, when we spoke in exercise of the right of reply\r\non 29 September 1999 following the deplorable speech by\r\nthe delegation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nI would like in conclusion to refer to what my\r\nMinister spoke of earlier regarding the incident mentioned\r\nby the representative of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. I do not know where that representative got this\r\nfrom, but he did not get the record straight. If he had\r\nbeen able to follow the news from international sources,\r\nhe would know that it was indeed Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo troops and their allies who earlier launched\r\nthe attack. We have already started to write a letter to the\r\nSecurity Council to denounce this breach of the ceasefire.\r\nI am pleased to say that the international community has\r\nso far responded to the declaration of that ceasefire by\r\nsaying, “Please go ahead; we need peace, not just for the\r\nCongo but for the whole region and for the world”.\r\nMr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\r\n(spoke in French): I apologize for taking the floor once\r\nmore at this late stage in the debate, and I shall be very\r\nbrief. My delegation wishes first to tell our compatriot,\r\nthe representative of Rwanda, that we are pleased to note\r\nthat he acknowledges the presence of Rwandan troops in\r\n40\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nKabinda, that is 2,000 kilometres from the border between\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. That\r\nsaid, my delegation affirms that we fully stand by our\r\nearlier statement in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Ntahomvunkiye (Burundi) (spoke in French): In\r\nresponse to the statement by the representative of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, I want to affirm my\r\ncountry’s position, which has been fully explained in all\r\nforums ever since the outbreak of war in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, notably during the numerous\r\nmeetings held at Lusaka. I note that, following those\r\ndiscussions Burundi was not identified as a belligerent\r\nparty. Mediators, observers and special envoys were present\r\nat those meetings. And for the same reasons, which I set\r\nout earlier in my statement in the general debate, Burundi\r\nwas not identified as an aggressor against the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. Having stated its security concerns\r\nabout its common border with the Congo following the\r\nupheaval caused by the war and the presence of armed\r\nbands known as the Front for the Defence of Democracy\r\n(FDD), my country has been and, I hope, will continue to\r\nbe invited to all talks aimed at bringing peace.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: We have listened to many world\r\nleaders and heads of delegation reflecting on the state of\r\nthe world and sharing with us their views on the progress\r\nmade by the international community over the past 54\r\nyears. The clarion call from delegations, shared by almost\r\nall speakers, was the need to create a world of peace,\r\nsecurity and the development of humankind.\r\nI would now like to express a few thoughts on some\r\nissues emanating from the two weeks of the general debate.\r\nMost speakers addressed various aspects of globalization.\r\nThere is a clear consensus on the need to ensure that the\r\nbenefits of globalization — resources, global markets,\r\nglobal technology and global ideas — are shared equitably\r\namong nations and among peoples. Many speakers\r\nexpressed the view that developing countries, for the most\r\npart, were too weak to take full advantage of the new\r\nopportunities, and that they often ran the risk of increasing\r\nmarginalization. They argued that in order for those States\r\nto benefit from globalization, the multilateral system should\r\nbe strengthened, including support for the United Nations\r\nand its work for global peace, human security, prosperity\r\nand sustainable development.\r\nPoverty was identified by many delegations as the root\r\ncause of some of the world’s problems such as political\r\nconflicts, degradation of the environment, violence and\r\ncrime. Many delegations singled out the debt burden as a\r\nmajor contributing factor to the untold suffering of\r\nwomen, children and the elderly in developing countries.\r\nMost representatives agreed that the eradication of\r\npoverty and the fulfilment of people’s aspirations for\r\ndevelopment require genuine international solidarity and\r\nmutually beneficial arrangements and cooperation between\r\nthe developed and the developing countries.\r\nMost delegations drew attention to the international\r\nfinancial and monetary system. Some stressed its qualities\r\nand argued in favour of keeping it as it is; others felt\r\nstrongly about its shortcomings, and proposed that it was\r\nnecessary to enhance the process of reforming the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions. Still others argued that the system\r\ncould not be reformed and that it should be scrapped\r\naltogether and replaced with a new, just, open system.\r\nClearly, the debate on this matter will continue in the\r\nweeks and months ahead, not least during the millennium\r\nsummit.\r\nI turn to the subject of conflict situations. Regional\r\nwars and other armed conflicts featured prominently in\r\nvirtually all statements in the general debate. All speakers\r\nacknowledged the destructive nature of wars and armed\r\nconflict and agreed to further strengthen the international\r\nand regional systems of collective security. They further\r\nencouraged the idea of dialogue and negotiations as a\r\nmeans to resolve differences.\r\nOn the notion of humanitarian intervention, there\r\nwere speakers who observed that respect for human rights\r\nhad become more important than the sovereignty of\r\nStates. Against this background, it was argued that the\r\ninternational community should intervene in the face of\r\ngross and systematic violations of human rights, with or\r\nwithout prior approval of the United Nations, particularly\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nOther Member States expressed the view that the\r\nnew notion of humanitarian intervention had the potential\r\nof destroying the United Nations Charter, undermining the\r\nsovereignty of States and overthrowing legitimate\r\nGovernments. They stressed that the protection of human\r\nrights was an obligation incumbent on all Governments\r\nwithin the context of the exercise of their sovereignty and\r\nconstitutional order.\r\nStill other delegations, recalling the spirit of the\r\nCharter of the world body, emphasized that nations could\r\nnot intervene in the internal affairs of others without a\r\n41\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nspecific Security Council mandate. They observed that any\r\nmassive violations of human rights leading to humanitarian\r\nemergencies required the coordinated action of the\r\ninternational community through the United Nations, and\r\nnot by a fiat of unilateral action and creation of faits\r\naccomplis that would set bad precedents.\r\nMost delegates were of the opinion that the subject of\r\nhumanitarian intervention needed to be discussed in depth\r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly — for\r\nexample, during the consideration of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nMost delegations agreed on the need for general and\r\ncomplete disarmament. Other speakers called for strict\r\nadherence to implementation of the existing international\r\ninstruments concerning disarmament. There was also a\r\nrenewed call for nuclear disarmament, the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and effective control of the\r\nproliferation of small arms.\r\nOn reform of the Security Council, judging from the\r\npronouncements of delegations on the reform, restructuring\r\nand democratization of the United Nations, there is a strong\r\nconsensus among many States in favour of further\r\nstrengthening the Security Council through its enlargement\r\nand making it more effective and representative and more\r\nresponsive to the challenges facing the world now and in\r\nthe next millennium.\r\nMany speakers noted that reform of the United\r\nNations was a prerequisite for the Organization\u0027s continued\r\nexistence and efficacy in the twenty-first century. Others\r\nmaintained that the manner in which the Organization dealt\r\nwith issues such as the eradication of poverty, regional\r\nconflicts, consolidation of the rule of law, human rights,\r\ndemocratic governance and a fair international economic\r\norder would define its role in the next millennium. In\r\naddition, there was a clear call for new forms of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the regional\r\norganizations to advance the cause of peace, justice and\r\ndevelopment around the world.\r\nRegarding the financial situation of the United\r\nNations, there was a clear consensus on the obligation of all\r\nMember States to pay their assessed contributions in full,\r\non time and without preconditions. Emphasis was placed on\r\nthe fact that the United Nations cannot perform effectively\r\nwithout funds, resources and competent personnel.\r\nVirtually all delegations addressed the plight of\r\nchildren, especially the phenomenon of child soldiers. There\r\nis a growing commitment that international instruments be\r\nelaborated to outlaw the use of children under the age of\r\n18 in armed conflict, thereby contributing to protecting\r\nfuture generations from the scourge of war.\r\nVirtually all delegations also referred to, and\r\nexpressed grave concern about, the alarming HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. They underscored the importance of enhanced\r\nglobal cooperation in fighting this dreaded killer disease,\r\nwhich has declared war against humanity.\r\nI should like to express my gratitude to those\r\nspeakers who cooperated in ensuring time management by\r\nobserving the 20-minute voluntary guideline established\r\nby the General Assembly. The average time for all\r\nspeakers was 23 minutes. When many delegations\r\nroutinely ignore the 20-minute voluntary time limit, this\r\nresults in the disruption of the scheduling of appointments\r\nof heads of State or Government, foreign and other\r\nministers, and the time allocated for other speakers. In\r\nfuture general debates, it would be appreciated if\r\ndelegations would continue adhering scrupulously to the\r\nearlier decision of the General Assembly in this regard.\r\nI also express my gratitude to the Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Yongjian Jin, and his able assistants as well\r\nas the Secretariat staff for their outstanding devotion to\r\nduty and professionalism.\r\nIt should be the business of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to endeavour to find solutions to the\r\nquestions raised during the general debate. As we begin\r\nconsidering the remaining substantive items of our\r\nagenda, both in the plenary and in Main Committees, I\r\ntrust that we will bring to bear on the debate the\r\nconcerns, hopes and aspirations expressed by all\r\ndelegations over the past two weeks.\r\n42\r\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 2 October 1999\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 9?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to make an\r\nannouncement concerning the programme of work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI should like to draw the attention of the General\r\nAssembly to document A/INF/54/3/Add.1, which covers the\r\nperiod from 4 October through 30 November and which has\r\nbeen distributed to delegations this morning. The attention\r\nof members is drawn in particular to the change in the\r\nschedule for the consideration of agenda item 11, entitled\r\n“Report of the Security Council”. Instead of being taken up\r\non Tuesday, 21 October, agenda item 11 will now be taken\r\nup on Wednesday, 20 October. The lists of speakers for the\r\nitems mentioned in document A/INF/54/3/Add.1 are now\r\nopen.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.10 p.m.\r\n43\r\n"
