(Namibia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 106\r\nSocial development, including questions relating to the\r\nworld social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled\r\npersons and the family: follow-up to the International\r\nYear of Older Persons\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/54/268)\r\nDraft resolution (A/54/L.6)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nAssembly, pursuant to resolution 52/80 of 12 December\r\n1997, decided at its 3rd plenary meeting on 17 September\r\n1999 to devote four plenary meetings on Monday and\r\nTuesday, 4 and 5 October 1999, to the follow-up to the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. I welcome to the\r\nUnited Nations those of you who have come to this\r\nimportant meeting from different parts of the world, and I\r\nwish you all a pleasant stay in New York.\r\nThe theme of the International Year of Older Persons,\r\n“A society for all ages”, is founded on the basic idea of\r\ninclusiveness, which should inform the human relations,\r\nfamily cohesion and social development that strengthen the\r\nsociety. In this sense, the theme of ageing links us to an\r\nearly period of the evolution of society and community\r\ninterdependence when older persons were revered for their\r\nwisdom and as repositories of traditions, customs and past\r\nachievements. This is, indeed, a welcome sign of a return\r\nto our roots and humanity.\r\nFor these reasons, the presence in this Hall of so\r\nmany senior Government representatives and other elderly\r\nand esteemed participants coming from their capitals\r\ndemonstrates the importance which Member States attach\r\nto the issue of ageing of persons and populations.\r\nQuestions relating to ageing have been on the United\r\nNations agenda since as far back as 1948. The noble\r\nideals and objectives enshrined in the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights enjoin us to strive towards\r\ncreating and maintaining human societies based on family\r\nvalues of loving and caring among all members of the\r\nfamily. Elders, parents, youth and children are all linked\r\ntogether through reciprocal relationships which\r\ncontinuously enrich their common heritage.\r\nIt was not, however, until the adoption of the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing by the World\r\nAssembly on Ageing, held in Vienna in 1982, that States\r\nand civil society started adopting public policy and other\r\nconcrete measures to deal with ageing. This Plan of\r\nAction is now the central policy document of United\r\nNations discussions and activities on ageing.\r\nThe United Nations General Assembly has taken\r\nsignificant steps since the World Assembly on Ageing to\r\nunderscore the importance which Member States attach to\r\nthe issue of ageing. These steps include: the designation,\r\nin 1990, of 1 October as the International Day of Older\r\nPersons; the adoption, in 1991, of the United Nations\r\nPrinciples for Older Persons; and, in 1992, the agreement\r\non the global targets on ageing for the year 2001. In\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\naddition, in 1992, the General Assembly proclaimed 1999\r\nas the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nIn the 1992 Proclamation on Ageing, the Assembly\r\nurged the international community to give generous support\r\nto national initiatives on ageing, consistent with national\r\ncultures and social conditions in relevant countries. Thus it\r\nis encouraging to see that in the course of this year, focal\r\npoints have been established in more than 100 Member\r\nStates. This clearly indicates that more and more nations\r\nare recognizing a significant increase in the population of\r\ntheir older citizens, who are now living longer. Perhaps\r\nmore importantly, there is growing awareness of the\r\nextraordinary speed with which these numbers will grow in\r\nthe years to come, sooner rather than later. These facts, I\r\nbelieve, have major implications for our thinking, attitudes\r\nand commitment and the public policy of nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General points out in his report entitled\r\n“International Year of Older Persons, 1999: activities and\r\nlegacies” that legislative initiatives have been undertaken or\r\nreinforced and strategies to deal with ageing put in place by\r\nsome Member States. While these efforts are forward\r\nlooking, more concrete actions need to be taken.\r\nThe central theme of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons has drawn its inspiration from the World Summit\r\nfor Social Development, held in March 1995 in\r\nCopenhagen. Since the Year’s theme was first introduced\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report of 1995 (A/50/114), its\r\ncore ideas have been developed to the point where it is now\r\npossible to suggest a model for the development of a policy\r\nframework on ageing. This model aims to present a new\r\nview and a new way of assessing ageing of individuals and\r\npopulations in a more holistic way. Surely, this is the best\r\napproach.\r\nI am confident that over the next two days the debate\r\nwill be characterized by new ideas and a renewed\r\ncommitment to the Proclamation on Ageing, which calls for\r\nthe recognition of humanity’s demographic coming of age\r\nand the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and\r\ninnovations in political, legal, social, economic, cultural and\r\nspiritual fields as our collective and determined way of\r\npreparing ourselves towards social justice, global peace,\r\nhuman development equality in the next century. “A society\r\nfor all ages” is a solemn exhortation directed at us all for\r\nan enlightened and goal-oriented debate on the challenges\r\nand opportunities that it conveys.\r\nI now call on the Deputy Secretary-General.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: I am very happy\r\nto be with you today as you gather to discuss the follow-\r\nup to the International Year of Older Persons. When he\r\nlaunched this International Year last October, the\r\nSecretary-General said we were in the midst of a silent\r\nrevolution. I am pleased to say that the silence has been\r\nbroken.\r\nThroughout the Year, 99 national committees and\r\ninnumerable other actors from all sectors —\r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations, academic\r\ninstitutions and the corporate world, not to mention the\r\nUnited Nations family — convened conferences,\r\norganized campaigns, launched studies, held cultural\r\nevents and created Internet pages, all in pursuit of one\r\ngoal: highlighting the issue of ageing and raising\r\nawareness of the implications of the demographic\r\nrevolution for individuals and societies all over the world.\r\nI would say that together they have done excellent work.\r\nAlthough it was not news to anyone that our\r\nsocieties are ageing, it was necessary to put some basic\r\nfacts into sharper focus. Globally, 1 out of every 10\r\npersons is age 60 or over. By 2020, the corresponding\r\nfigure will be one out of every eight persons, and by\r\n2150, every third person will be over 60.\r\nAlthough statistics are often said to hide more than\r\nthey reveal, these are, by any standards, startling numbers.\r\nThey show beyond any doubt that, even if all other things\r\nremain equal, families, communities and societies will be\r\ndramatically different a century from now. And since we\r\ndon’t know very much else about what tomorrow’s world\r\nwill look like, it would indeed be foolish not to prepare\r\nfor one of the transformations we do know we will have\r\nto face.\r\nAnother important fact the Year has brought to light\r\nis that although Europe is projected to remain the major\r\narea of the world affected by ageing, future changes will\r\nbe more dramatic in the less developed countries.\r\nMoreover, these regions will be facing the ageing factor\r\nat the same time as they face a large increase in their\r\ntotal population, as well as the ongoing challenge of\r\ndevelopment. So their strategies will have to be tailored\r\naccordingly. When it comes to ageing policies, one size\r\ndoes not fit all.\r\nDeveloped countries will mainly have to address the\r\nspecial needs of the growing number of very old people\r\nin their populations and to examine the appropriateness of\r\ncurrent retirement policies and practices, income security\r\n2\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nprovisions and pension schemes. Less developed countries\r\nwill have to focus more on the link between ageing and\r\ndevelopment, the eradication of poverty in older\r\npopulations, support for families, health care, and human\r\nand institutional capacities to address the needs of older\r\npeople.\r\nThe Year also helped put the ageing revolution in a\r\nmore positive perspective. Extending life expectancy is, we\r\nhave been reminded, something humanity has always\r\nstriven for; achieving it is truly one of the greatest\r\nsuccesses of this century. With it naturally comes the\r\nageing of societies. Like all structural changes, this poses\r\na challenge. As long as we do not cling to outdated ideas\r\nand habits, this challenge can be a great opportunity.\r\nOf course, this will only be possible if the older\r\ngenerations participate fully in the life of their communities\r\nand countries. They have to be given the means to do so.\r\nAs the International Plan of Action on Ageing said as long\r\nago as 1982, in paragraph 32:\r\n“the transition to a positive, active and\r\ndevelopmentally oriented view of aging may well\r\nresult from action by elderly people themselves,\r\nthrough the sheer force of their growing number\r\nand influence.”\r\nThis is an appealing idea. But we should not take it to\r\nindicate that everything will just fall into place once there\r\nare enough older people around. A lot of planning can be\r\ndone, and must be done, for ageing to become a positive\r\nforce.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe International Year has helped us to become aware\r\nof the fact that, throughout the twentieth century policies\r\nconcerning older persons were drawn up in the context of\r\nyoung societies. Henceforth, it is with ageing societies in\r\nmind that we need to tailor our policies, that we need to\r\nformulate all our policies, including those concerning other\r\nage groups.\r\nHaving collectively realized our dream of a longer life\r\nexpectancy, we now need to adapt to it. On the level of\r\npolicies, infrastructures and distribution of resources,\r\nGovernments will need to seek the means to meet varying\r\naspirations and needs.\r\nFinancial security and the health of older persons\r\nnaturally remain a key concern. Our thinking should go\r\nmuch further, however, to include questions such as\r\ncontinued training, the promotion of healthy life styles\r\nfrom early in life, extended families, relations between\r\ngenerations, the status of women, labour policies and the\r\nlink between ageing and socio-economic development. In\r\nall these spheres, investments made today will avoid\r\nconsiderable imbalances and dependencies later on, both\r\nfor the individual and for ageing societies. I would go\r\nfurther: if these policies are carefully thought out, they\r\nwill allow for the transformation of what could otherwise\r\nbecome a burden into a valuable source of human, social\r\nand economic capital.\r\nWell thought out investments assume concerted and\r\nplanned action, rather than timely intervention. The\r\nquestion of ageing, with its numerous and extremely\r\ncomplex ramifications, has to be examined in the broadest\r\ncontext possible. In other words, the way to confront it\r\nseriously is to make it an integral part of all economic\r\nand social development programmes, whether local,\r\nnational or international.\r\nThe United Nations, for its part, is determined to\r\nplay its part so that the International Year may continue\r\nto bear fruit. As the Assembly knows, we have launched\r\nlong-term initiatives, such as the Research Agenda on\r\nAgeing for the Twenty-first Century and a data bank on\r\nnational policies and programmes, accessible on the\r\nInternet. I invite all States Members to actively support\r\nthese projects and benefit from them. And I thank all\r\nthose who have already made a generous financial\r\ncontribution.\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons is not an\r\nend in itself, but a springboard. Like all springboards, it\r\ncan change a resolute impulse into a great leap forward.\r\nIt can give us the necessary impetus to create a richer and\r\nmore mature society in the next century, relying on the\r\nparticipation of each individual and meeting the needs of\r\nall its members, no matter what their age. Let us not lose\r\nthis opportunity.\r\nI wish the Assembly success in its work.\r\nThe President: Before calling on the first speaker\r\non the list, I should like to recall that a note verbale dated\r\n3 September 1999 was transmitted to permanent missions,\r\nwith the suggestion that statements at these four plenary\r\nmeetings should not exceed 10 minutes.\r\n3\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nIn view of the large number of speakers on the list, it\r\nwould be appreciated if speakers adhered to the 10-minute\r\nguideline.\r\nMs. Perho (Finland): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries associated with the Union — Bulgaria,\r\nthe Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,\r\nPoland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the\r\nassociated countries, Cyprus and Malta, as well as the\r\nEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, member\r\nof the European Economic Area (EEA), Liechtenstein, have\r\nexpressed their wish to align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons is soon\r\ncoming to its end. However, the end of the Year should be\r\nseen also as a start, and as an opportunity to carry forward\r\nthe legacy of the Year. As the Secretary-General so rightly\r\nstates in his report (A/54/268), the activities of the Year,\r\norganized all over the world, have brought to the Year a\r\nglobal relevance that will sustain and move “A society for\r\nall ages” into the new millennium.\r\nOlder persons have a crucial role to play in the\r\ndevelopment process: they should be seen as active\r\nparticipants at all levels and in all activities of societies, not\r\nas dependants. The objective of any policy on ageing\r\nshould be to promote older persons\u0027 well-being and their\r\nability to cope as independently as possible, and to improve\r\nand promote the care they receive. Equality, the right to\r\nself-determination, economic independence and security are\r\nfundamental values underlying such a policy. A holistic,\r\nmulti-sectoral policy on ageing must encompass all the\r\ncentral dimensions of life in society: working life and\r\nlivelihood; health and functional capacity; the home and the\r\neveryday environment; education and culture; social welfare\r\nand health care; and social interaction and participation.\r\nPolicies on ageing should also foster dialogue and solidarity\r\nbetween generations.\r\nGlobally, population ageing is a common phenomenon.\r\nIts impact on society, however, must be seen as closely\r\nlinked to country- or region-specific situations where\r\neconomic, social, cultural and other factors may vary\r\ngreatly. The pace of growth in the number of older persons\r\nis faster than anticipated, posing new challenges to societies\r\nall over the world.\r\nThe European Union earlier this year released a\r\ncommunication entitled “Towards a Europe for All Ages —\r\nPromoting Prosperity and Intergenerational Solidarity”. This\r\ncommunication, from the Commission of the European\r\nCommunities, was seen as necessary mainly because of\r\nthe rapid changes in population structures in the European\r\nUnion countries, one manifestation of which is increasing\r\nlife expectancy.\r\nIncreasing life expectancy is a result of successful\r\nsocial and health policies and improved overall living\r\nstandards and general well-being. However, in ageing\r\nsocieties such as those in Europe one of the concerns is\r\nhow national economies will be able to meet the\r\nchallenge of growing pensions costs. There are various\r\nreform initiatives under discussion which aim to prolong\r\nactive participation by the ageing population in working\r\nlife. There is also a need to identify new forms of labour\r\nthat would take ageing workers\u0027 needs into account: these\r\nnew forms include such measures as developing various\r\npart-time work or part-time retirement schemes.\r\nThe majority of today\u0027s retiring people are healthy\r\nand active citizens who do not need any targeted social\r\nservices for older persons. The researchers describe this\r\nphenomenon as “the third age” — following\r\nchildhood/youth and active working life — the age when\r\nan individual is still healthy, active and financially\r\nindependent.\r\nIn Europe the number of people in the oldest age\r\nbracket, 80 and above, is growing. Many European\r\ncountries face the challenge of meeting the needs of this\r\npopulation group. Even for this age group, the objective\r\nis to design policies and services that enable them to live\r\nlives that are as independent as possible. Their daily\r\nphysical and mental environment should be “older people\r\nfriendly”, and they should have access to social and\r\nhealth care services that meet their needs. The importance\r\nof these factors as they affect older people\u0027s lives was of\r\ncourse set out in the 1982 Vienna International Plan of\r\nAction on Ageing.\r\nThe policy on ageing in my own country follows\r\nvery much those lines. Finland is among those European\r\nUnion countries whose population is ageing fastest. Our\r\npolicy on ageing has been mostly Government and\r\nmunicipal policy, with clear emphasis on social welfare\r\nand health policy. To an increasing degree, however,\r\nweight is being given to the importance of civil society,\r\nincluding non-governmental organizations and private-\r\nsector actors. Our objective is an active old age, giving\r\nolder people equal right to participate and to learn.\r\n4\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nThe human rights of older people require special\r\nattention. The issue of ageing women is part of the general\r\nissue of the advancement of women and cannot be dealt\r\nwith in isolation. Older women make a significant\r\ncontribution to development; policies and strategies must be\r\ndesigned that support their active participation and\r\nguarantee them equal rights in any society. In Europe,\r\naccording to a recent report from the European Commission\r\nentitled “Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the\r\nEuropean Union 1998”, the ageing of Europe is the ageing\r\nof older women.\r\nThe States Members of the United Nations report\r\nevery four years to the Organization on issues of ageing.\r\nThere have been, however, some problems with this\r\nreporting, such as a lack of responses from Governments.\r\nThis has resulted in a very narrow picture of the\r\ncircumstances and life situations of older people across the\r\nworld. One difficulty with the reporting has probably been\r\nthat the challenges relating to ageing and old age are very\r\ndifferent in different parts of the world.\r\nGood practices and working methods are very specific\r\nto national and local situations: it has not been possible to\r\ntransfer them in their entirety to different contexts. We\r\nwelcome the establishment by the United Nations of an\r\nInternet-accessible database on ageing that will make it\r\npossible to exchange information and good practices which\r\nwill provide us with a wider global picture. The usefulness\r\nof this database will depend largely on the input from\r\nGovernments.\r\nAt all levels, including local, national and\r\ninternational, long-term strategic work is necessary. Since\r\npopulation ageing as a global phenomenon will have a very\r\nstrong impact on social development, we will have to\r\nmainstream ageing-related issues in our social and\r\neconomic policies at all levels — including at the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe European Union considers the 1982 International\r\nPlan of Action on Ageing a milestone in United Nations\r\npolicy on ageing. There is, however, an obvious need to\r\nrevise it to make it correspond to the needs of today. The\r\nEuropean Union would address this need by supporting the\r\nidea of developing a new long-term strategy on ageing.\r\nThis should be based on the experience gained within the\r\nimplementation of the 1982 Plan. This kind of approach\r\nwould also make it possible to review and reform the\r\npresent reporting system in a way that would better serve\r\nthe Member States and the international community.\r\nThe European Union believes that the holding of a\r\nglobal meeting in the year 2002 to review the outcome of\r\nthe first World Assembly on Ageing — particularly the\r\ninterrelationship between ageing and development —\r\nwould contribute to the formulation of a new strategy on\r\nageing, while maintaining the momentum created during\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his efforts to bring these issues to the global\r\nagenda during the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nOur sincere thanks also go to the Chairpersons of the\r\nConsultative Group for the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, Ambassador Julia Alvarez and Counsellor\r\nAurelio Fernández.\r\nMr. Francese (Italy): My delegation feels very\r\nprivileged, Mr. President, to take part in this morning’s\r\ndebate on the issue of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons and its follow-up under your wise and effective\r\nguidance.\r\nItaly feels that we all owe a great debt of gratitude\r\nto the United Nations for its efforts on behalf of older\r\npersons. Over the past decade or so, the Organization has\r\ndefined the United Nations Principles for Older Persons,\r\nproduced the Vienna International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing, and proclaimed the special Year as a way of\r\nfocusing attention on the theme “Towards a society for all\r\nages”. Making 1999 the occasion for international\r\nattention to older persons in the name of greater justice\r\nand solidarity is a fitting way to close the millennium.\r\nAgeing is an issue of vital importance to the social\r\npolicies of Italy, a nation that has one of the oldest\r\npopulations in Europe and the world. In fact, our National\r\nStatistics Institute has forecast that by 2040 the\r\npercentage of the population that is over the age of 60\r\nyears will have increased by 39 per cent, and the\r\npercentage of those over 80 years of age by 9.3 per cent.\r\nIn addressing the issue of ageing, we must pay heed\r\nto a number of principles fundamental to the lives of\r\nolder persons: independence, participation in society,\r\nprovision of care, education and, finally, dignity. To\r\nimplement them we need long-term strategies to\r\nrecognize, appreciate and value older persons and their\r\nrole in society. Italy has accepted this difficult challenge\r\nwith determination and vigour.\r\nFor instance, in the Preparatory Commission of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, Italy has drafted a proposal\r\n5\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nto safeguard the older person. This is just one example of\r\nhow raising matters in a number of international bodies can\r\nhelp to raise the standing of our senior citizens.\r\n“Growing old well, growing old together” was the\r\ntheme of the Italian Government’s planning and allocation\r\nof resources on the occasion of the celebration of the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. The Italian people as\r\na whole were mobilized through the National Committee\r\nfor the Celebration of the International Year, expressly\r\ncreated and chaired by our Minister for Social Solidarity,\r\nThe Honourable Livia Turco, who had originally planned\r\nto be here with us today but who was kept behind in Rome\r\nby a sudden parliamentary emergency. The Committee’s\r\nmembers include representatives of several Government\r\nministries, local and regional authorities and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nThe national media helped launch an information\r\ncampaign using advertising spots and television\r\nprogrammes on older persons in which various personalities\r\nparticipated. United Nations documentation on ageing was\r\nwidely distributed, thanks to intense publication activity. In\r\nthe spirit of article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, a petition\r\nwas circulated to amend article 3 of the Italian Constitution\r\nby introducing a clause to outlaw any form, direct or\r\nindirect, of age discrimination.\r\nTo raise public awareness of the issues of ageing and\r\nat the same time to listen to the emerging needs of civil\r\nsociety, the National Committee has sponsored initiatives\r\nthroughout the country intended to leave a lasting effect in\r\nthe coming years and decades. One major step was the\r\nconference entitled “Close-up on Old Age”, held in Rome\r\nin May this year. The speakers included top leaders of the\r\ncountry, beginning with the Prime Minister, The\r\nHonourable Massimo D’Alema, who emphasized the\r\nGovernment’s commitment to older persons. The purpose\r\nof the conference was twofold.\r\nThe first purpose was to announce the presentation to\r\nthe Government of a draft law for the establishment and\r\norganization of a volunteer civilian service of older persons.\r\nThis service would promote participatory, cooperative and\r\nresponsible citizenship, while underscoring the many\r\nqualities that older persons have to offer after a lifetime of\r\nexperience.\r\nThe second purpose was to receive contributions that\r\nwould help lead to approval of the law on reforming the\r\nwelfare system, currently being discussed in Parliament,\r\naimed at creating an integrated system of actions and social\r\nservices focusing on older persons. The reform is based\r\non the fundamental notion that the older person must be\r\nconsidered a legal subject, and stresses the need to\r\nprovide new, added economic subsidies to families living\r\nwith older members. A key point of the reform is the\r\nneed to expand social services to include better home\r\nservices for older persons who are not self-sufficient.\r\nThe National Committee has further sponsored\r\nactivities by local and regional authorities, associations\r\nand labour organizations. A number of conferences and\r\nseminars were held throughout the country to increase\r\nawareness of a fundamental need of contemporary\r\nsociety, that of creating a new generation of older persons\r\nthat rejects a reductive view of old age as a state of\r\nmedical dependence. The main issues they addressed\r\ninclude adult education, legal and social security,\r\nintegrated systems of welfare and health actions and\r\nservices, with a focus on Alzheimer’s patients — some\r\nhalf a million persons in Italy are afflicted in old age by\r\nthis illness — active ageing, empowerment, ageing and\r\ngender, and social security. Strong emphasis was placed\r\non inter-generational solidarity through various projects\r\naimed at promoting dialogue with young people. These\r\nlectures were accompanied by cultural and social events,\r\nin which many volunteer associations of older people\r\nparticipated.\r\nOne of the Committee’s most noteworthy steps was\r\nits adoption and endorsement of the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\nDeclaration of the Responsibilities of Present Generations\r\nTowards Future Generations. Among the activities\r\npromoted by local and regional authorities, labour unions\r\nand non-governmental organizations were international\r\nand national conferences on the issues associated with\r\nageing, ranging from broad cultural and social debates to\r\nmore focused discussions of the specific economic,\r\nmedical and psychological concerns of the elderly.\r\nThe Committee will wrap up its activities at the end\r\nof this celebratory Year with a “Show of Good Practices”,\r\nan event involving 8,000 Italian municipalities. The Show,\r\nto be held in Catania next February, will aim to spread\r\nknowledge of activities to benefit older persons being\r\ncarried out at the local level. It will also seek to prod our\r\nculture towards developing a social system that\r\nencourages the active citizenship of older persons, assures\r\ntheir well-being and provides support for persons with\r\nreduced independence. This is the kind of activity we\r\nhave to carry out in coming years so that our national\r\n6\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\npolicies aimed at enriching the lives of our senior citizens\r\nare made more and more effective.\r\nIn this spirit, Italy has sought to do its part to promote\r\nunity among different persons and institutions, restore\r\nmeaning to the end of the millennium in this area and\r\nexpress solidarity with older people in Italy and throughout\r\nthe world in this celebratory Year and beyond.\r\nMs. Bergmann (Germany): The current year has been\r\ndeclared the International Year of Older Persons. It is\r\ndedicated to the concerns of a special group within our\r\npopulation, older persons. However, the theme, “Towards\r\na society for all ages”, clearly demonstrates the need for all\r\nmembers of society to become involved.\r\nIn Germany, we have endeavoured to pursue concrete\r\ngoals where possible — goals which are in close contact\r\nwith the real circumstances in which people live. These\r\ninclude fostering citizens\u0027 social commitment and\r\ninvolvement as well as voluntary social work on the part of\r\nsenior citizens; promoting quality assurance in assistance\r\nand care for older persons; strengthening the existing\r\npotential for solidarity among young and old alike; and\r\npromoting dialogue with politicians.\r\nIf we were to attempt a preliminary evaluation today,\r\nit would become clear that the conferences which have\r\nalready been held and the projects and campaigns\r\nconducted, as well as the International Year, have been\r\nsuccessful and have managed to draw the public\u0027s attention\r\nto this pressing topic. While the International Year of Older\r\nPersons has thus contributed to raising national and\r\ninternational awareness about population ageing, a society\r\nfor all ages will require concrete steps. If we are to set the\r\ncourse for the societies and senior citizens of tomorrow and\r\nbeyond, we need a new impetus and impulses which will\r\ntake us beyond 1999 into the next millennium.\r\nLet us recall once again the historic international\r\nconference on Ageing, held in Vienna in 1982, which\r\nadopted the International Plan of Action on Ageing. Its aim\r\nwas to support Member States in formulating their national\r\npolicies and programmes. One central message of the Plan\r\nof Action on Ageing was that older men and women should\r\nbe enabled to make as comprehensive a contribution as\r\npossible to society.\r\nA great deal has been achieved since then. The Vienna\r\nPlan of Action contributed, for example, to an increase in\r\nthe attention given to the opportunities and challenges\r\nposed by ageing and related issues in many parts of the\r\nworld. However, since the International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing reflects the political, social and economic situation\r\nof 20 years past, the time has come to make a renewed\r\neffort to build on the achievements of the past and take\r\naccount of the challenges now before us.\r\nThe demographic changes which have been\r\noccurring for a number of years now, not only in all of\r\nthe countries of Europe but worldwide, have begun to\r\ndramatically change the landscape of our societies and\r\nurgently demand action by all responsible decision-\r\nmakers.\r\nIn the Federal Republic of Germany, for instance,\r\nthe proportion of those over the age of 60 will be twice\r\nthat of those under the age of 15 in 30 years\u0027 time.\r\nToday, with the exception of Japan, the 25 countries with\r\nthe highest proportion of citizens over the age of 65 are\r\nlocated in Europe. By the year 2030, the European Union\r\nwill have to reckon with over 100 million senior citizens,\r\nof which some 20 million will be 80 and older.\r\nAt the same time, the ageing of populations has\r\nspread well beyond the industrialized world. The current\r\ngrowth rate of the elderly population in the developing\r\ncountries is more than double that in developed countries.\r\nPercentages by themselves do not always give a sense of\r\npopulation ageing. In sub-Saharan Africa, between 1995\r\nand 2015, the growth percentage-wise will be barely\r\nperceptible. The number of elderly people, however, will\r\nrise from 17 million to 29 million.\r\nLacking funds and unable to provide basic social\r\nservices, developing countries struggle to come to terms\r\nwith the growing numbers of elderly people. It has turned\r\nout to be a myth that families are always able to assume\r\nresponsibility for the elderly. Being cared for by one\u0027s\r\nfamily often means sharing the family\u0027s poverty. The\r\ndevelopment process itself often causes stresses for\r\nfamilies.\r\nProductive ageing may in the end turn out to be a\r\nhelpful concept for many countries. Moving ageing into\r\nthe mainstream of national development agendas could be\r\nachieved by creating opportunities for older people to\r\nearn income while contributing to the growth of the\r\neconomy. This requires a coordinated national effort and\r\nassistance from international governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. On the whole, more\r\nimportant than the quantitative changes are the qualitative\r\nand structural changes which are connected with these\r\ndemographic trends. These call for political action.\r\n7\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nI therefore propose we now focus on the building of\r\nfoundations for concrete policies and measures. The United\r\nNations and all States have a key role to play to advance\r\nthis global process, which aims to ensure that policymakers\r\nintervene wherever a new course can be set for the benefit\r\nof individuals in policies on health care, the labour market,\r\neducation, cultural affairs and housing.\r\nWe at the United Nations should make a\r\ncomprehensive attempt to adapt the nearly 20-year-old\r\nVienna International Plan of Action on Ageing to the\r\nchanged conditions and adjust it to meet the challenges of\r\nthe future. I propose that to this end, the General Assembly\r\ndecide to take appropriate steps so that the Commission for\r\nSocial Development can take up this project.\r\nExpert seminars could provide the technical foundation\r\nfor a revised text which could be submitted to the\r\nCommission for Social Development for further\r\ndeliberations in the year 2001. The Commission on the\r\nStatus of Women and the Commission on Population and\r\nDevelopment should also be involved in this endeavour,\r\nbecause they can contribute expertise on the issues of older\r\nwomen and overall population policies.\r\nIn the year 2002, on the occasion of the twentieth\r\nanniversary of the Vienna Plan of Action, it should be our\r\naim to honour the work done in the past two decades and\r\nto adopt a new, second International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing. I am confident that this proposal will have the\r\noverall support of Member States and observers in the\r\nUnited Nations. The Federal Republic of Germany is\r\nprepared to grant financial support for the preparatory work\r\nneeded to revise the International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing.\r\nIn this context, I would also like to recall that the\r\nVienna Plan of Action envisaged work at the regional level.\r\nSince regions have different characteristics in terms of\r\npopulation ageing, greater use ought to be made of this\r\npossibility in the future. As a concrete first step in this\r\ndirection, I would like to inform the Assembly that\r\nGermany is willing to hold a ministerial conference for the\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe (ECE) region in Berlin\r\nin 2002, provided, of course, that the ECE members\r\napprove that proposal.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to take the opportunity to\r\ndraw the attention of the Assembly to a very extraordinary\r\nperson. Ambassador Julia Alvarez of the Dominican\r\nRepublic has been a staunch advocate of the senior citizens\r\nof this world over the past two decades. Her countless\r\ninitiatives and her untiring efforts are testimony to one\r\nperson’s shining example of what a single individual can\r\nachieve for society. Her contribution to the promotion of\r\npolicies for older persons has been and continues to be of\r\ninestimable value.\r\nMs. Alvarez (Dominican Republic) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The delegation of the Dominican Republic has\r\nthe honour of addressing the General Assembly at its\r\nmeeting dedicated to the follow-up to the International\r\nYear of Older Persons. Much has changed since the\r\nWorld Assembly on Ageing, which was held in Vienna in\r\n1982, when it was first acknowledged in an important\r\ninternational forum that the ageing of the population was\r\nnot confined to the industrialized world but was actually\r\ngoing to have its greatest impact in our developing\r\ncountries.\r\nInitially, that change came slowly. The World\r\nAssembly on Ageing itself produced an International Plan\r\nof Action on Ageing, which focused more on\r\nhumanitarian issues more than on the consequences of\r\nageing for development. The Trust Fund for Ageing,\r\nwhich in 1982 contained $1 million, quickly and quietly\r\ndisappeared, and the Plan of Action languished and lost\r\nall validity as a productive working instrument for the\r\nfuture. At the international conferences devoted to other\r\nsubjects, older people continued to be included among\r\nother vulnerable groups. Despite the fact that the concept\r\nof productive aging continued in theory to be the desired\r\nobjective, in practice it was rarely made concrete through\r\nnew and fruitful initiatives.\r\nA decade later, however, we had at least begun to\r\nface our future. We proclaimed 1 October as the\r\nInternational Day of Older Persons; we adopted the\r\nUnited Nations Principles for Older Persons; and, of\r\ncourse, in 1992 we declared that 1999 would be the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons, with the theme, “A\r\nsociety for all ages”.\r\nIn view of the fact that in the past United Nations\r\nactivities on ageing have often been characterized by a\r\ngap between intention and action and between\r\nproclamations and effective projects, it has been\r\nheartening to see this revival of an awareness of the\r\nsignificance of population aging and the potential social\r\nrole that older people can play — a revival brought about\r\nin particular by the International Year of Older Persons,\r\nwhich is now drawing to a close.\r\n8\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nThe report of the Secretary General entitled\r\n“International Year of Older Persons, 1999: activities and\r\nlegacies” summarizes and highlights selected activities in\r\nobservance of the Year. It also analyses the impact of the\r\nYear on the direction and substantive content of the United\r\nNations programme on ageing. We would like briefly to\r\nhighlight some of the activities and accomplishments of our\r\ncountry in preparing for and celebrating the Year.\r\nFirst of all, in September 1998, the Congress of the\r\nDominican Republic drafted and approved a Code of Rights\r\nfor Older Persons and established a national commission to\r\noversee its enforcement. Older persons were consulted\r\nbefore the drafting of the document through the\r\nnon-governmental organizations belonging to the Network\r\nfor the Dignity of the Elderly, which also mobilized public\r\nopinion in support of the Code. We believe that concerted\r\neffort to protect and defend the rights of older persons was\r\nour greatest contribution to the International Year of Older\r\nPersons.\r\nThe Dominican Republic also became the first\r\ndeveloping nation to work on the issue of ageing together\r\nwith a group of developed nations, joining the United\r\nStates, France, Japan and the United Kingdom in the\r\ncreation in 1998 of the International Longevity Centre in\r\nthe Dominican Republic, with its headquarters in Santo\r\nDomingo. That Centre is carrying out various intercultural\r\nstudies and joint projects.\r\nWe have also celebrated the Year by exhibiting works\r\nof art and publishing poetry produced by elderly people,\r\nand we have organized competitions asking school children\r\nto describe how they see themselves after the age of 60.\r\nFurthermore, we have developed a community health\r\nprogramme to make elderly people aware of the need to\r\ntake care of their own health.\r\nWith regard to promoting the concept of productive\r\nageing, the support of the media has been invaluable in\r\neliminating stereotypes and creating a positive attitude to\r\nageing. As a developing nation, we do not have the luxury\r\nof considering older persons merely as a drain on our\r\nlimited resources. We do not have the means necessary to\r\npull them into the twenty-first century, but with goodwill,\r\nimagination and an openness to social innovation, we hope\r\nto move forward with them into the new world of ageing.\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons has shed light\r\non and celebrated one of the most dramatic developments\r\nof our time. Increased life expectancy is producing\r\nsomething new under the sun: an alteration in the basic\r\ncharacter of the human population of the Earth. It will so\r\nprofoundly alter society that we run the danger of being\r\nleft with institutions that were designed to deal with a\r\nworld that no longer exists.\r\nThe challenges and opportunities presented by this\r\nunprecedented and uncharted era in human history are\r\nonly now beginning to take shape. We live in the era of\r\nageing, but we are only at the dawn of that era.\r\nWhether our societies can rise to the occasion is not\r\nyet clear. We speak often of increased life expectancy,\r\nbut not yet enough about what we can expect from that\r\nincreased life. We anticipate that ageing populations will\r\ndrain our resources, yet society allows older people to be\r\neclipsed as vital, contributing members of their\r\ncommunities. We obsess about population statistics\r\nwithout sufficiently considering what all the numbers that\r\nconstitute those statistics add up to.\r\nIf we are to add life to the years that have been\r\nadded to life, and if we are to marshal all our potential\r\nresources to deal intelligently with this new social order,\r\nwe need to understand the shape and the size of what\r\nconfronts us. With older people looming larger in the\r\nstatistical profiles of most countries, what will be or could\r\nbe the nature of intergenerational ties in the future? What\r\ndoes increased longevity mean to people of all ages?\r\nWhat is the significance of the feminization of ageing?\r\nHow can we formulate political and social strategies to\r\ndeal with ageing that could also be adapted to economies\r\nin various stages of development? Of what has been tried\r\nso far, what works best, and why does it work?\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons has\r\nhighlighted the potential of older people themselves to\r\nplay a leading role in meeting these demographic\r\nchallenges. Older people must be allowed and encouraged\r\nto see themselves as actors in the drama of their own\r\nlives and in their societies. They must be enabled to\r\nparticipate in the functioning of those societies as active,\r\nproductive members, not as people who are passive and\r\nneedy — who at best arouse pity and at worst are viewed\r\nas a burden. All of us must be fully aware that ability, not\r\nchronology, is the measure of how much people can\r\ncontribute to society.\r\nFocusing attention on a group by proclaiming a year\r\nin its honour is always a bit of a risk. When the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons ends, will these\r\npeople be discarded like a 1999 calendar? By 31\r\nDecember 1999, if we have the will and the foresight to\r\n9\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\ncreate a society for all ages, we will have gone beyond the\r\ncalendar, certain, and proud, of having put older people on\r\nthe map.\r\nWe are determined that for older people this time will\r\nbe their time, that the clock will not run out with the\r\ncalendar. We must ensure that the efforts made during the\r\nYear will not end when the clock strikes twelve on 31\r\nDecember 1999. We thus welcome the idea of the\r\nGovernment of Germany to host a regional ministerial\r\nconference on ageing under the aegis of the Economic\r\nCommission for Europe in 2002 as a way to encourage\r\nregional follow-up initiatives. We hope that this will be\r\nemulated by other countries and other regions.\r\nFinally, we want to underline a proposal that we feel\r\nwill play a fundamental role in our overall plans for the\r\nfuture. Indeed, the generous offer by the Government of\r\nSpain to host a second World Assembly on Ageing in 2002\r\ndeserves our heartfelt gratitude and our sincere commitment\r\nto cooperate as much as we can for the success of the 2002\r\nWorld Assembly.\r\nMr. Insanally (Guyana): In commemorating the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons in 1999, the last year\r\nof the twentieth century, and indeed of the second\r\nmillennium, we cannot fail to recognize the important\r\ncontribution which older persons have made to shaping the\r\npresent century and, indeed, to shaping our civilization from\r\ntime immemorial.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of 77 and China, some 133\r\ncountries in all, I take this opportunity to salute and thank\r\nthem for the legacy they have bestowed on our younger\r\ngeneration as they prepare to face the challenges of the\r\nfuture. The accumulated wealth of experience and\r\nknowledge of today’s elderly will undoubtedly provide\r\ntomorrow’s adults with a solid foundation on which to build\r\ntheir own lives.\r\nIn this context, let me say a word of praise to\r\nAmbassador Julia Tavares de Alvarez of the Dominican\r\nRepublic, one of our own, who has done so much single-\r\nhandedly to advocate the cause of older persons.\r\nDeveloping countries have long recognized the\r\nsignificance of an ageing population for their national\r\ndevelopment. In most of our societies, the old are treated\r\nwith honour and respect. No wonder, then, that in 1992,\r\nwhen the Proclamation on Ageing was adopted by\r\nconsensus by the General Assembly as resolution 47/5, the\r\nsponsors of that resolution were, significantly, the\r\ndeveloping countries. That resolution built upon the\r\noutcome of the World Assembly on Ageing held in 1982\r\nand on the United Nations Principles for Older Persons,\r\nwhich were adopted in 1991. Along with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s global targets on ageing, the programme of\r\naction sought to integrate national and international plans\r\ninto a unified campaign to deal with the “greying” of the\r\nworld’s population. The Group of 77 today remains\r\nfirmly committed to this comprehensive and cooperative\r\napproach.\r\nFor, while the problems of ageing have been more\r\nassociated with developed rather than developing\r\ncountries, perhaps because of lower fertility rates and\r\nmortality rates in the former, it is merely a matter of time\r\nbefore they are common to both. As we have heard,\r\nstatistics show that by 2005 more than 70 per cent of all\r\npersons 60 years old and over will live in developing\r\ncountries. The obligation to provide them with\r\nemployment opportunities, improved health care,\r\neducation and other social benefits will not be easily\r\nsatisfied. The Governments of these countries, faced as\r\nmany of them are with heavy debt burdens and severe\r\nstructural adjustment programmes, will find it difficult if\r\nnot impossible to bear the costs of adequate social\r\nmeasures. Hopefully, in the forthcoming reviews of the\r\nWorld Summit for Social Development and of the Fourth\r\nWorld Conference on Women we will have further\r\nopportunities to develop international cooperation to\r\nsatisfy the needs of the elderly, who, as we know,\r\nconstitute one of the most vulnerable sectors of our\r\nsocieties.\r\nThe life-cycle approach to development has now\r\ngained wide international acceptance. The 1992\r\nProclamation on Ageing observed that preparations for\r\nold age should begin in childhood and continue\r\nthroughout life for the entire population. Such an\r\napproach could serve to integrate the concerns of the\r\nelderly into national development strategies and plans.\r\nSpecial attention will have to be given to older women,\r\nwho have particular needs and who thus require\r\nprogrammes and policies that are sensitive to their\r\nsituation. In too many cases, women are disadvantaged in\r\nterms of their access to education, housing, health care\r\nand employment. Their contributions to the economy and\r\nsociety are generally unrecognized and unappreciated.\r\nThis is the case not only in the home but in the wider\r\ncommunity. Yet in Africa for example, where conflict and\r\nthe HIV/AIDS virus prevail, the elderly are often forced\r\nto assume the role of head of the household when they\r\nthemselves are in need of care.\r\n10\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nIt is thus incumbent on policy makers to take account\r\nof these factors in order to provide an enabling environment\r\nfor older persons, particularly women, that would allow\r\nthem to participate in the development process. In most\r\ndeveloping countries, the family has traditionally been the\r\nsource of support and care for the elderly. Today, however,\r\nthe institution of the family is often undermined by such\r\ntrends as migration, the AIDS pandemic, drug abuse and\r\nother socio-economic changes. Despite their constraints,\r\nGovernments, must assume greater responsibilities for the\r\nnurture of the aged and protection of the family. However,\r\nthey can succeed only if other stakeholders in society,\r\nincluding the private sector and community organizations,\r\nare willing to assist in sustaining social programmes for the\r\nelderly. In this context, the press and other media certainly\r\nhave a role to play in enhancing public awareness of\r\npopulation ageing and the need to address the issue fully.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China calls for increased United\r\nNations activities to address ageing in the context of\r\ndevelopment. Programmes in the areas of research, training\r\nand technical cooperation relating to ageing can contribute\r\nto a clearer understanding of available policy options and\r\nthereby assist national efforts to achieve global targets on\r\nageing by the turn of the century. Adequate resources must\r\ntherefore be provided to those United Nations agencies\r\nwhich are concerned with these social issues. At the same\r\ntime, recognizing that the problems of development must be\r\ntreated in a comprehensive and holistic fashion, the\r\ninternational community must agree on a closely knit\r\nstrategy of cooperation aimed at creating better living\r\nconditions for all the world\u0027s people. Such a strategy would\r\ninclude increased official development assistance flows,\r\ndebt reduction, investment and trade opportunities,\r\nemployment and access to health, education and other\r\nsocial benefits, which would allow the disadvantaged\r\nsocieties of developing countries, including their elderly, to\r\nadvance.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China firmly believes that with\r\nrenewed effort and commitment, we can overcome the\r\nhurdles of injustice, inequality and marginalization which\r\nexist between and within our societies today. By joining\r\nhands and working together, we can truly hope to develop\r\nwhat the Secretary-General has called “a society for all\r\nages”.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): I am indeed honoured to\r\naddress this plenary meeting of the General Assembly on\r\nfollow-up to the International Year of Older Persons, 1999,\r\nunder the theme “Towards a society for all ages”.\r\nI would first like to express the Indonesian\r\ndelegation\u0027s heartfelt appreciation to you, Mr. President,\r\nfor your remarks delivered earlier. I should also like to\r\nassociate my delegation with the statement just delivered\r\nby Guyana on behalf of the Group of 77.\r\nBefore proceeding, let me express my appreciation\r\nto the Deputy Secretary-General for her insightful\r\nstatement, and also the United Nations Secretariat for the\r\nconsiderable efforts that have gone into the observance of\r\nthe International Year.\r\nThe implications of the ageing of our societies come\r\nas no surprise. Indeed, this issue that has been discussed\r\nat the United Nations and in many other forums over\r\nrecent years. It was, thus, that the United Nations\r\nconvened the World Assembly on Ageing in 1982, the\r\nsame year in which this body adopted the International\r\nPlan of Action on Ageing. Nearly one decade later the\r\ncontinuing discussions on ageing resulted also in the\r\nadoption of the United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons, and soon thereafter of the global targets on\r\nageing for the year 2001. In fact, if I may recall, the\r\nInternational Plan of Action clearly states that the\r\nprogressive ageing of our societies is neither an\r\nunexpected nor an unforeseeable event. It is, rather, a\r\nresult of worldwide socio-economic development. The\r\nadvances in science, medicine and technology in the past\r\nhalf century, and especially in the past decade, have\r\ngreatly increased the average life expectancy, not only for\r\nthe rich and privileged few, but also for the vast\r\nmultitudes throughout the world. Global life expectancy\r\nhas risen 20 years in only four decades. And as the war\r\non disease, malnutrition and poverty continues, as\r\nlongevity increases, we must rethink our concepts of old\r\nage and the challenges of this demographic shift. Not only\r\nmust we prepare for the inevitable changes that will occur\r\nin employment structures, income security and health\r\ncare, to name a few, but also to achieve the goals set\r\nforth in the United Nations Principles for Older Persons\r\nand a guarantee that longevity will be accompanied by\r\ndignity.\r\nIn this regard, the Indonesian delegation would like\r\nto welcome and commend the efforts that have been and\r\nare being made within the United Nations programme on\r\nageing. The exploration of “wisdom” in a technology-\r\noriented world, as well as the “competitive advantage” of\r\nolder persons in the new service-oriented economies, are\r\nimportant initiatives. This approach contributes to defining\r\nthe role of older persons in society and the contribution\r\nthey make, as well as addressing the essential question of\r\n11\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nmainstreaming ageing into social and economic policies and\r\nprogrammes. I would also add that Indonesia is encouraged\r\nby the ongoing formulation of a policy framework for a\r\nsociety for all ages, particularly within the context of the\r\ncontributions to be made to national development.\r\nThe challenges ahead are truly complex and\r\nmultidimensional. For we live in an age not only of\r\nincreasing longevity, but also one in which the very\r\ndynamics of family life are being altered by economic\r\nreality. One manifestation of this is the increasing entrance\r\ninto the workforce of traditional caregivers, which alters the\r\npresence of multigenerational support within the family.\r\nThis, in turn, lends added importance to the need for\r\nincome security and opportunities for older persons for a\r\ndecent livelihood. Also, the particular situation of older\r\nwomen needs to be addressed and obstacles to their\r\nparticipation in social and economic development removed.\r\nIn my own country, Indonesia, we too have enjoyed\r\nthe advances leading to increased life expectancy and\r\nimproved quality of life. And while Indonesia is\r\ndemographically a youthful society, we nevertheless\r\nappreciate fully the long-term implications that the ageing\r\nof our society will have for future social and economic\r\npolicy. With less than 10 per cent of the population\r\nconsidered to be older persons and with a decreased\r\npopulation growth rate, we may anticipate a considerable\r\ndemographic shift in the coming years.\r\nDespite grappling with the consequences of the\r\neconomic crisis that has engulfed Indonesia, along with\r\nother countries of the region, we remain committed to\r\npursuing effective policies and programmes for older\r\npersons, consistent with the goal of society for all ages. In\r\nour society and our culture older persons have always been\r\naccorded a high degree of respect and deference. Our\r\nchallenge is therefore to ensure that this attitude is not\r\nthreatened by the vagaries of economics or the uncertainties\r\nof globalization. We need to move even further along the\r\npath towards ensuring that older persons fully enjoy\r\nindependence, participation, care, self-fulfilment and\r\ndignity.\r\nAmong the activities that have been carried out for\r\nolder persons within Indonesia is the celebration of a\r\nnational day, in organizing a celebratory walk involving\r\nolder persons and in other activities designed to draw\r\nattention to this International Year, including held under the\r\ntheme “Tua Berguna dan Berkualitas”, which means that\r\nolder people still have a vital role to play and a contribution\r\nto make to national development. This day was proclaimed\r\nfor the purpose of increasing awareness, improving the\r\nwelfare of older persons, motivating society to solve\r\nproblems faced by older persons and improving multi-\r\nsectoral cooperation in this effort. At the same time,\r\nIndonesia continues to maintain the concept of “three\r\ngenerations under one roof”, or what is called more\r\nsimply the extended family system.\r\nAmong other initiatives at the national level,\r\nIndonesia’s Ministry of Social Affairs has been\r\ninstrumental in the issuance of new stamps, in organizing\r\na celebratory walk involving older persons and other\r\nactivities designed to draw attention to this International\r\nYear, including the issuance of a brochure to further\r\npublicize the goal of the Year. With a limited budget and\r\nwithin the constraints imposed by the current financial\r\nsituation, Indonesia remains active and effective in\r\naddressing this issue.\r\nLet me conclude by noting that for developing\r\ncountries — which are lacking in social-insurance and\r\nsocial-security systems and rely heavily on family support\r\nstructures — ensuring the health and well-being of all the\r\ncitizenry is a constant struggle, in view of our limited\r\nmeans for taking action. At the same time, I firmly\r\nbelieve that if we are to take anything from this\r\nInternational Year, it should be a new perception of older\r\npersons. They should not be viewed as the recipients of\r\ncare or merely as a vulnerable group that must be\r\nprotected, but as vital resources possessing a lifelong\r\nwealth of knowledge and lifelong experiences that should\r\nbe fully employed in achieving a society for all.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nWe would like to begin by thanking you, Mr. President,\r\nfor your words of guidance at the opening of this\r\nmeeting, and we also appreciate the important\r\ncontribution made by the Deputy Secretary-General. We\r\nwant to associate ourselves with the congratulations\r\nexpressed to Ambassador Julia Alvarez for her important\r\ncontribution to this issue. We also commend the work of\r\nthe Group of 77 on this item.\r\nWe welcome the decision of the General Assembly\r\nto devote four meetings to the problems of older persons,\r\nand we believe that this provides a magnificent\r\nopportunity for our Organization to analyse with due care\r\nthe problems afflicting one of the most vulnerable\r\nsegments of the population, whose quality of life — or\r\nlack thereof — is a representative of the growing\r\ndisparities throughout our world between the\r\n12\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nindustrialized countries and the third world and between the\r\nhighest-income groups and the poorest.\r\nThe complacency with which the international\r\ncommunity has thus far considered the problems of older\r\npeople and all the surrounding issues has inevitably\r\ninvolved statistical fictions that attempt to show that\r\ntangible progress is being made. These statistics overlook\r\nthe fact that there is another world, the world of the\r\nmajority, which is not that of the industrialized countries\r\nand in which different, often subhuman conditions prevail.\r\nThis situation needs to be tackled realistically and\r\ncourageously and resolved efficiently and with solidarity.\r\nThe most recent report on global population indicates,\r\nin overall terms, that in the past 50 years the average life\r\nexpectancy of the world’s population as a whole has\r\nincreased by approximately 20 years. The report proposes\r\nthat, as a result, people in their sixties will make up 11.1\r\nper cent of the total world population by the year 2010.\r\nHowever, we cannot fail to point out that this benefit will\r\nnot come to everyone equally; nor can we accept passively\r\nthe idea that the great majority of people in underdeveloped\r\ncountries are doomed by massive, dire poverty, hunger,\r\npoor health and malnutrition not to be a part of these\r\noptimistic statistics — but, rather, to be included in the\r\nmorbidity and mortality statistics characteristic of the less\r\ndeveloped regions of the world.\r\nThe most illustrative example of this is perhaps the\r\ncase of Africa. For our African brothers and sisters, average\r\nlife expectancy at birth is 49 years for men and 51 for\r\nwomen, while in developed Europe the figure is 69 years\r\nfor men and 77 for women.\r\nHow can higher levels be reached when on the African\r\ncontinent 23 million people are suffering from AIDS, when\r\n172 boys and 154 girls out of every thousand are likely to\r\ndie by the age of five, when infant mortality has reached\r\nthe astronomical level of 91 children per one thousand live\r\nbirths?\r\nHow can we claim that overall statistics give a real\r\npicture of the situation in third world countries? What we\r\nshould really be doing is comparing life expectancy and,\r\nabove all, quality of life between countries. In African\r\ncountries, for example, per capita gross domestic product in\r\n1998 was a meagre $1,261, while in opulent Europe that\r\nsame year, per capita gross domestic product was almost\r\nnine times as high: $10,189.\r\nHow can we compare the incomparable? In Africa\r\nhealth expenditures represent only 3.2 per cent of gross\r\ndomestic product, while in Europe that figure is 7.1 per\r\ncent — and the gross domestic products of Africa and\r\nEurope are hardly comparable.\r\nHow could life expectancy at birth in third world\r\ncountries approach that of the industrialized countries? In\r\nthe former an astronomical 48 million people die of\r\npreventable diseases. In Africa the maternal mortality rate\r\nis 940 per 100,000 births, and in South-East Asia the\r\nfigure is 610 per 100,000 while in Europe the rate is 59\r\nper 100,000.\r\nAnother example comes from the 1998 mortality\r\nstatistics reported by the World Health Organization. A\r\ntotal of 4,695,000 Africans died from infectious and\r\nparasitical diseases, including tuberculosis, while for\r\nEuropeans the figure was only 234,000 — or one\r\ntwentieth as many. This shameful inequality between\r\ndeveloped countries and third world countries is the\r\nfundamental reason why only 8.5 per cent of the\r\ninhabitants of developing countries will be 60 or older in\r\nthe year 2000, whereas 19.5 per cent of the population of\r\ndeveloped countries — in other words, more than twice\r\nthe proportion — will have reached that age.\r\nIn the majority of the countries of the\r\nunderdeveloped world the basic concern is therefore not\r\nhow to deal with all the various aspects of a boom in\r\nelderly people, but rather how to ensure that at least a\r\nsmall part of the population can actually reach that stage\r\nof life. This is the dilemma of some African countries,\r\nwhere it is painful to see poverty and AIDS, among other\r\nscourges, allowing only 3 per cent of their inhabitants to\r\nlive past the age of 60, while in some European countries\r\n24 per cent of the population is 60 or older.\r\nSome 15 per cent of the populations of the United\r\nStates and Europe live in so-called islands of poverty in\r\nthe developed world, where there are amazingly low\r\nfigures for life expectancy, in some cases similar to those\r\nof most third-world countries. Of course, this shocking\r\nreality does not mean that we minimize the role of this\r\nforum in steering the United Nations to the goal of\r\nworking towards a well-deserved quality of life for older\r\npersons. We agree that this is a basic demand in a large\r\npart of the world, and that makes it a reasonable\r\naspiration.\r\nAt the same time, however, we firmly believe that\r\nsuccessfully meeting the challenge of guaranteeing a life\r\n13\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nexpectancy of at least 60 years in all countries and a\r\nregularly declining rate of mortality is an aspiration of\r\nequally high priority. It is also essential to redefine, beyond\r\nrhetoric, the ways of ageing in order to give real meaning\r\nand dignity to the “quality of life” concept for older\r\npersons.\r\nWe must not fail to give serious and profound\r\nconsideration to the lack of solidarity suffered by many\r\nolder persons when family members, especially their\r\nchildren, shirk their responsibilities, and to the isolation,\r\ndespair and loneliness in which a large number of these\r\nolder persons must live. This phenomenon is having an ever\r\nincreasing impact on opulent high-consumption societies.\r\nThe vulnerability and social neglect of older persons\r\nare especially clear in the segment of the population of\r\nindustrialized countries that belongs to those islands of\r\npoverty. The best-known manifestation of this is the\r\n600,000 homeless that, according to the United States Vice-\r\nPresident, lived in his country in 1997. The non-\r\ngovernmental organizations place that figure at 1 to 3\r\nmillion people, a large proportion of whom are of the third\r\nage.\r\nThe follow-up to the International Year of Older\r\nPersons is of particular relevance to Cuba. Cuban society\r\nattaches the highest priority to this age group, especially at\r\na time when the ageing of a population has become one of\r\nthe great challenges to a country whose falling birth rate is\r\ncomplemented by a steady decline in mortality and where\r\nhealth services reach the entire population.\r\nWe therefore strongly defend the idea, reflected in\r\nCuban social policy, that older persons need increasing\r\nopportunities and support systems in various areas and with\r\ngreater urgency. This includes the generation of income,\r\nsocial security and comprehensive care. Satisfactory ageing\r\nis not just a legitimate aspiration of human beings, but also\r\nan indicator of development and good health.\r\nIn this respect, we were delighted by the successful\r\nconvening of the GENTOVIDA \u002799 event, which concluded\r\nlast Friday in Havana and included the third Latin\r\nAmerican congress of the International Association of\r\nGerontology and the second Ibero-American meeting of\r\nolder persons. Specialists and older persons themselves\r\nmade important contributions to the great endeavour of\r\nimproving the quality of life of older persons and enhancing\r\nthe gerontology culture.\r\nFor Cuba, the subject of older persons is of high\r\npriority. Currently, 13.6 per cent of the Cuban\r\npopulation — approximately 1.3 million inhabitants — is\r\n60-years old or older. By the year 2025, it is forecast that\r\none of every four Cubans will be over the age of 60. The\r\nreality of our population is the basic result of our\r\nGovernment\u0027s ongoing deep-seated social policy to\r\nguarantee universal and free health care, hospitalization\r\nand social security for all older persons. This is an\r\nimportant cause of the rise in life expectancy at birth to\r\n75 years.\r\nAmong the programmes designed to improve health\r\nand social-care indicators for older persons is one for\r\nolder adults that ensures special medical care to that\r\nbroad segment of the population, as well as social care\r\nfor older persons on their own. This is aimed at targeting\r\nsufficient attention to and promoting an independent life\r\nand full participation in social life for those who need\r\nsociety\u0027s support and care. Furthermore, pension\r\nexpenditure is rising at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent,\r\nwhile the number of pensioners is increasing by 2.4 per\r\ncent a year. 12.6 per cent of our population benefits from\r\nthis system. Cuba currently pays 1.3 million pensions for\r\nretirement, disability and death benefits.\r\nWe are also working to improve adult education, to\r\ncreate a university chair for the third age and to broaden\r\nthe dissemination of information on the problems and\r\nconcerns of that segment of our population. Given the\r\nforeseeable demand, we are already planning future\r\ntraining of the labour force and broadening medical and\r\ngeriatric services.\r\nThere have been many obstacles to the development\r\nof this social policy. The economic war waged by the\r\nGovernment of the United States against Cuba, including\r\nthe four-decade economic, financial and trade blockade\r\nthat has intensified in recent years, has had a particularly\r\nnegative impact on older persons, who form an especially\r\nvulnerable group, by limiting, inter alia, their\r\nconsumption of the special food and medication they\r\nrequire.\r\nWe are aware that achieving the “society for all\r\nages” advocated by the United Nations is a major\r\nchallenge, particularly to the third-world countries, which\r\noften lack the resources to develop social programmes to\r\nimprove the quality of life of the population in general\r\nand of older persons in particular, especially because of\r\nthe application of structural adjustment policies, the\r\nimpact of financial crises and the reduction of official\r\n14\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\ndevelopment assistance. It is necessary for solidarity and\r\ncooperation to prevail so that mortality can decline, life\r\nexpectancy rise and the population age with dignity in the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn this respect, Cuba is prepared, as always, to\r\ncontribute to this objective, of course without any\r\nconsideration of economic benefit whatsoever. In one group\r\nof countries in Africa, a fraternal continent in great need,\r\nabout 200 Cuban physicians are providing services. This\r\nfigure will soon rise and does not include physicians\r\nworking under contract, of whom there are 400 in South\r\nAfrican villages. In the new programme of entirely free\r\nservices that we are providing to the poorest countries of\r\nAfrica with the most difficult health conditions, no fewer\r\nthan 3,000 Cuban physicians are available to the\r\ninhabitants.\r\nIn Central America and the Caribbean, we are still\r\ndeveloping our comprehensive health plan, through which\r\n1,200 of our physicians and health-care specialists are\r\nproviding care absolutely free.\r\nThe industrialized countries could cooperate by\r\nproviding medication in the struggle to save and prolong\r\nlife in these needy areas of the third world.\r\nFurthermore, 2,000 students are training as physicians\r\nin the Latin American School of Medicine, an initiative\r\naimed at providing better medical care in neighbouring\r\ncountries. In coming months, the School will have 3,000\r\nstudents, and 6,000 in three years. Similarly, we are\r\npromoting the establishment of medical schools with Cuban\r\nteachers to provide free training for health-care workers in\r\nthe field in Africa.\r\nMay I conclude my statement by expressing my\r\nconviction that, in order to increase life expectancy,\r\nimprove health-care indicators and the quality of social life,\r\nand successfully confront the very specific problems of\r\nolder persons, it is crucial to have an international\r\neconomic order that is just, fair and sustainable and makes\r\nit possible for these challenges to be met, regardless of the\r\ndifficulty of surrounding circumstances.\r\nMs. Hönigsperger (Austria): Let me start by stressing\r\nthat Austria fully endorses the statement which was\r\ndelivered on this agenda item by the Presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons has been and\r\ncontinues to be a welcome occasion for Austria to redirect\r\nand anchor its policy on older persons in the public\r\nconsciousness in line with the United Nations Principles\r\nfor Older Persons.\r\nAustria defined the goals of the International Year of\r\nOlder Persons at a very early stage, at the start of 1998,\r\nand established an Austrian National Committee to\r\nPrepare and Implement the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, chaired by the Federal Minister of Environment,\r\nYouth and Family Affairs. The Committee comprises all\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental institutions active in\r\nthis field in order to achieve the widest possible\r\nparticipation.\r\nIn Austria, the core objectives in implementing the\r\nYear are defined as follows: appreciation of old age as an\r\nequal third life-cycle stage; encouragement of dialogue\r\nand interaction between the generations; active inclusion\r\nof older persons in society and politics; and the promotion\r\nof voluntary work by older persons through the\r\nestablishment of community centres for these activities.\r\nIn implementing the International Year of Older\r\nPersons, Austria puts great emphasis on achieving\r\nmaximum awareness and participation of its citizens, as\r\nwell as on measures to foster and improve policies\r\ntargeting older persons. The challenge of an ageing\r\nsociety is being addressed in more than a thousand events\r\nand initiatives. At the same time, targeted and sustained\r\naction is being taken at the political level. Let me\r\nhighlight a number of these initiatives.\r\nThe International Year of Older Persons was\r\nlaunched in Austria on l October 1998 with the\r\nobservation of the International Day of Older Persons.\r\nThe day was guided by the motto “Dialogue between\r\ngenerations — action day for a better understanding\r\nbetween the generations”. More than 300 events were\r\norganized on this Action Day throughout the country,\r\nranging from counselling on free health care to platforms\r\ndevoted to the dialogue between generations.\r\nWe also initiated several competitions aimed at the\r\nimplementation of the goals of the Year. One competition,\r\nat the community level, awards projects and initiatives\r\nwhich encourage the implementation of the concept of\r\nsolidarity between generations.\r\nThe Austrian State Award for Family-Oriented\r\nJournalism reflects the motto of the International Year:\r\n“Towards a society for all ages”.\r\n15\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nIn April 1999, the Federal Ministry of Environment,\r\nYouth and Family Affairs and the Federal Ministry of\r\nEducation and Cultural Affairs jointly launched a\r\ncompetition evaluating long-term projects devoted to the\r\nissue of intergenerational dialogue. The competition targets\r\nstudents and youth organizations, as well as older persons\r\nwho wish to interact with the young generation.\r\nWithin the scope of the Austrian National Committee,\r\nwe also initiated seven working groups to develop and\r\nimprove a comprehensive policy on older persons for my\r\ncountry, engaging more than 500 actors. It is their\r\nresponsibility to analyse future challenges regarding the\r\ntrend of an ageing society and to develop a sound basis for\r\nsustainable long-term programmes.\r\nFor the first time in Austria, a comprehensive\r\nscientific study on the situation of older persons was\r\nprepared this year. The findings of this study will guide our\r\nwork in the future. The report provides concrete\r\ninformation on the housing situation, lifestyles, family\r\nnetworks, health care and societal participation of older\r\npersons in Austria. This initiative is based on the United\r\nNations recommendation to study and analyse the situation\r\nof senior citizens. The first Austrian report on older persons\r\nwill be submitted to the Austrian Parliament for discussion\r\ntowards the end of the year.\r\nOne of our major concerns regarding the\r\nimplementation of the goals defined by the International\r\nYear of Older Persons is appreciation for voluntary work.\r\nOlder citizens should be offered opportunities and options\r\nfor active and independent enjoyment of life at the third\r\nstage. Our model project of centres for voluntary work\r\ngives momentum to voluntary social activities at the\r\ncommunity level. There is a lively demand for these\r\nplatforms, which foster intergenerational dialogue. We will\r\ncontinue our efforts to develop a new culture of volunteers,\r\nincluding for the young population. This initiative should\r\nalso be seen in the context of the International Year of\r\nVolunteers, which will be observed in 2001.\r\nIn order to enhance the participation of older persons\r\nin society, we launched an initiative at the local level which\r\nshould open new opportunities for older persons to design\r\ntheir environment in an active manner. Local mayors and\r\nsenior citizens are the target group for these activities\r\naimed at the development of new modalities of\r\nrepresentation for senior citizens.\r\nIn order to improve the protection and promotion of\r\nthe rights of older persons, the Federal Ministry of\r\nEnvironment, Youth and Family Affairs appointed a\r\nFederal ombudsperson. This institution acts as a focal\r\npoint for all legal concerns of older persons, giving\r\nspecial attention to the needs of senior citizens living in\r\nresidences for the elderly.\r\nAs a preliminary résumé of Austrian events and\r\ninitiatives organized within the scope of the Year, we can\r\ndistinguish the following trend: an ageing society is\r\nreceiving increasing attention in the context of social\r\npolicies in Austria. This achievement is complemented by\r\nan increase in reports by the Austrian media on issues\r\nrelated to older persons.\r\nWe have also been able to present convincing\r\narguments for reorienting the paradigms of policies\r\ntargeting older persons towards the United Nations\r\nPrinciples for Older Persons. In this regard, we take\r\nconcrete action in redirecting the relevant Austrian\r\npolicies through numerous measures that receive\r\nconsiderable attention from the public.\r\nAustria would like to stress that the United Nations\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons has triggered a major\r\nmomentum for a broad and in-depth discussion on the\r\nsituation of older persons. We believe that the Year\r\nenhances opportunities for our senior citizens to\r\nparticipate in society and shapes the image of older\r\npersons in a positive way.\r\nIn this context, we wish to pay tribute to the\r\ndedication and determination of Ambassador Julia\r\nAlvarez, who made the Year a reality.\r\nIn following up on the results of International Year\r\nof Older Persons, we will continue to pursue these\r\nobjectives, with a view to their sustained implementation.\r\nMr. Larraín (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We\r\ncelebrated the International Day of Older Persons on 1\r\nOctober, and we reaffirmed our commitment to the\r\nVienna International Plan of Action on Ageing, adopted\r\nin 1982 at the World Assembly on Ageing. That Plan of\r\nAction is a clear example of how an organized\r\ninternational community can contribute decisively to\r\nefficiently dealing with subjects which are the daily\r\nconcern of our peoples.\r\nNonetheless, the vital momentum given to this\r\nsubject by the United Nations would be of no significance\r\nwithout the effective commitment of national\r\nGovernments to implement the recommendations of the\r\n16\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nPlan of Action. In this context, my Government is pleased\r\nto report that in 1990 Chile began a series of actions aimed\r\nat dealing systematically and comprehensively with the\r\nsituation of older persons. In that year, the department of\r\npolicies for priority groups set up, within the social division\r\nof the Ministry of Planning, to design a national strategy in\r\nthis field. Following a diagnostic process, in 1993 the\r\nChilean Government adopted a national ageing and old age\r\npolicy and established the National Committee for the older\r\nadult, with its respective regional committees, with the aim\r\nof studying formulas for implementing that national policy.\r\nThis process has become particularly important in our\r\ncountry because the analysis of demographic trends and\r\nprojections shows characteristics of an advanced stage of\r\ndemographic transition, a stage in which Chile finds itself.\r\nBeginning with the period 1995-2000, these characteristics\r\ntranslate into a decrease in natural annual population\r\ngrowth, together with the continued ageing of the\r\npopulation already begun in earlier decades. Statistics also\r\nshow that the ageing trend has a more marked impact on\r\nthe female population, especially in rural areas of our\r\ncountry.\r\nThat makes even more urgent the need indicated in the\r\nEqual Opportunity Plan for Chilean Women 1994-1999 to\r\nformulate policies and programmes having regard to the\r\nspecific circumstances of older women. Those\r\ncircumstances include the metabolic degenerative problems\r\npeculiar to women\u0027s biology and psychological problems\r\nstemming from lack of social recognition, such as the fact\r\nthat a higher proportion of older women are poor and heads\r\nof household, or have a dependent status.\r\nSpecific women\u0027s programmes go hand in hand with\r\nspecial programmes to increase and improve services for\r\nolder persons who are poor and to encourage them to take\r\npart in social life. As a result, in the decade now drawing\r\nto a close Chile has reduced the proportion of over-60s\r\nliving in poverty from 20.4 per cent to 10 per cent.\r\nAmong the programmes that we have established we\r\ncan highlight the following.\r\nWith regard to health, there are five ongoing\r\nprogrammes to resolve the nutrition, education and self-care\r\nproblems of the elderly and to provide education for a\r\nhealthy life.\r\nIn the area of housing, there are programmes to\r\nrehabilitate dwellings for poor older people and meet basic\r\nhousing needs.\r\nOn social development, 13 programmes are being\r\nimplemented to improve the living conditions of the older\r\npopulation. In this sphere, the Solidarity and Social\r\nInvestment Fund has since 1996 developed a programme\r\nentitled “More life for your years”, which is aimed at\r\npoor persons over 65. This programme in turn has two\r\ncomponents. The first, called “Services for the older\r\nperson”, is to provide services at the community level and\r\nfacilitate access to existing public services within and\r\noutside the community level. The second makes available\r\nto organizations of older persons small funds, for which\r\ncompetitive application must be made, to implement their\r\nown initiatives.\r\nIn the area of education and training, there have\r\nbeen programmes geared to the cultural recreation of\r\nolder persons and to training in written and oral skills.\r\nLastly, I would like to place on record that the\r\nbeginning of the International Year of Older Persons was\r\ncelebrated in Chile with the convening of a fourth large\r\ngathering of older persons, a three-day event, with the\r\ntheme “Living life”. In addition, 1 October has been\r\nofficially designated the Day of the Older Person, and the\r\nwhole of October has been designated the Month of the\r\nOlder Person.\r\nFurthermore, the theme of the International Year,\r\n“Towards a society for all ages”, has been interpreted by\r\nmy country as an invitation to work for the elimination of\r\nall forms of discrimination against older persons in our\r\nsociety. Thus, the main objective of our national policy\r\nfor the older person is to achieve a cultural change\r\nresulting in better treatment of older persons. This is an\r\nendeavour involving all social actors in the country.\r\nI have given a brief account of the concrete actions\r\nbeing taken by the Chilean Government to improve the\r\nliving conditions of older persons, honouring the\r\ncommitment solemnly made in Vienna 18 years ago. In\r\nthis respect, the Chilean Government considers it essential\r\nto continue the work of our Organization on the subject\r\nof ageing, work which is being efficiently guided by the\r\nSecretariat in the right direction.\r\nWe will soon be celebrating the twentieth\r\nanniversary of the Vienna International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing, and the Government of Chile believes that on\r\nthat occasion — in 2002 — the international community\r\nwill have to meet to analyse the progress made and set\r\nlong-term guidelines and strategies for the coming years,\r\n17\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nyears which, demographic trends indicate, will be\r\ncharacterized by a continuous ageing of our population.\r\nMr. Maravall (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): While fully\r\nsupporting the statement made today by Finland on behalf\r\nof the European Union, my delegation wishes to make this\r\nadditional statement to share our national experience\r\nregarding the International Year of Older Persons and the\r\nactivities needed for its satisfactory follow-up.\r\nIn Spain the International Year was a decisive catalyst\r\nfor greater attention by our society to the situation of older\r\npersons and questions related to ageing. It also generated\r\nmany activities, debates and proposals which we consider\r\nto be of great interest and to which I will briefly refer.\r\nIt is also important to point out that the International\r\nYear significantly promoted the associations of older\r\npersons movement in Spain, especially through the State\r\nCouncil of Older Persons.\r\nAs we reported last February during the meeting of\r\nthe Commission for Social Development, at the end of 1997\r\nwe established the National Coordination Committee for the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons. This Committee,\r\npresided over by the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs,\r\nincludes all the non-governmental organizations represented\r\non the State Council of Older Persons; representatives of\r\neach of the 17 Regional Councils of Older Persons;\r\nrepresentatives of non-governmental organizations of a\r\ngeneral nature; representatives of universities, foundations\r\nlinked to major corporations and financial entities; and\r\nlastly, representatives of State, regional and local\r\ngovernment. At the beginning of this year, coinciding with\r\nthe beginning of the International Year, the Committee\r\nstarted a programme of activities for the Year which\r\neventually amounted to more than a thousand celebrations\r\nand activities related to the International Year at all levels,\r\nfrom local to national, including autonomous communities.\r\nThe national activities, in addition to a publicity\r\ncampaign on the International Year and other measures to\r\npublicize it, included a campaign to promote volunteer\r\nactivities by older persons and an evaluation of the National\r\nGerontology Plan, an integrated part of our policy for older\r\npersons, adopted in 1991 for the decade. This evaluation\r\nshowed both positive aspects and important achievements,\r\nbut also considerable shortcomings, which we are working\r\non to rectify them in a new plan.\r\nAmong the advances made during this period, we\r\nwould highlight the following: the universalization and\r\nimprovement of public pensions; improvements in\r\npreventive health and hygiene programmes; a considerable\r\ngrowth in residential care provision for older persons,\r\nhelp provided at home and from outside; the development\r\nof quality of life programmes; subsidized travel and\r\nhealth spa visits, as well as transport adapted to their\r\nneeds and the removal of barriers to mobility in buildings;\r\nthe establishment of programmes for older persons in\r\nmany universities; and a significant change in the public\r\nimage of older persons, in particular attitudes of and\r\ntowards older women.\r\nAs regards the shortcomings, three fields are under\r\nparticular consideration: the priority that should be given\r\nto caring for dependent older persons, especially victims\r\nof Alzheimer\u0027s disease and other dementia; the need to\r\npromote flexible and diversified programmes to support\r\nfamilies caring for older persons; and the need to promote\r\ncomprehensive social welfare and health programmes.\r\nI should like to mention another aspect relating to\r\nour social security system. Ways of making retirement\r\nmore flexible, better adapted to the new realities of older\r\npersons, are also on the agenda of our national debate, to\r\nwhich the International Year has contributed new and\r\ninteresting perspectives. It must be said that the attitudes\r\nof older persons towards ageing, and of society towards\r\nolder persons, has changed; today a 65-year-old person in\r\nSpain cannot in general be considered elderly, inactive or\r\nsick. If to this we add a considerable rise in life\r\nexpectancy — approximately 80 years on average in our\r\ncountry, particularly for women — we can easily\r\nunderstand the need to adapt our legislation on retirement\r\nto these changes, promoting more flexible formulas in our\r\nsocial security system.\r\nWithin our national experience, I would highlight an\r\nimportant agreement that was signed two weeks ago\r\nbetween the Spanish Government and the unions on an\r\nincrease and improvement in pensions. I would highlight\r\nalso that Spain has promoted a master’s degree course in\r\nsocial gerontology in Brazil for Ibero-American\r\nprofessionals and has co-funded the Congress of\r\nNetworks of Older Adults in Argentina.\r\nAlthough the International Year of Older Persons\r\nwill not come to an end until December, we can already\r\nsay that it has more than amply lived up to the initial\r\nexpectations. The International Year has generated\r\nconsiderable interest in ageing-related issues and the\r\nsituation of older persons by giving these subjects a new\r\ndimension in which the fundamental approach does not\r\n18\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nfocus on dependency but rather on the potential of older\r\npersons as active agents for development in our societies.\r\nWe are attempting to formalize this concept around the\r\nexpression “active and healthy ageing”.\r\nIn its resolution 37/2, the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment requested the Secretary-General to solicit the\r\nopinions of States, non-governmental organizations and the\r\nprivate sector on updating the International Plan of Action\r\non Ageing and on the desirability and feasibility of\r\nconvening in the year 2002 a review of the outcome of the\r\nWorld Assembly on Ageing including the interrelationship\r\nof ageing and development. This consultation, which\r\nconcerns various steps to be taken in the next few years to\r\nprovide proper follow-up to the International Year of Older\r\nPersons is, we believe, very opportune.\r\nMore specifically, in response to the questions posed\r\nin resolution 37/2, I wish first of all to reiterate that Spain\r\nis in favour of convening in the year 2002, a global\r\nconference to review the results of the first World\r\nAssembly on Ageing in Vienna 1982. We believe that this\r\ngathering in 2002, which could be called the Second World\r\nAssembly on Ageing, should be a basic element in\r\nInternational Year follow-up activities. It should enable us\r\nto formulate a long-term strategy on ageing taking into\r\naccount the most recent trends in the ageing process in our\r\nsociety, and their implications; in this, the concept of a\r\nsociety for all ages must be the touchstone.\r\nWe also believe that the interrelations between ageing\r\nand development — as the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment rightly pointed out — must be fully explored,\r\nand in this respect we believe that a Second World\r\nAssembly on Ageing should pay particular attention to the\r\nproblems of ageing in the developing countries. These\r\nproblems are not the exclusive concern of those countries\r\nalone; they are also matters of global interest.\r\nIn the light of all these considerations, it also seems to\r\nus that work should begin on updating the International\r\nPlan of Action on Ageing. The results of the updating\r\nprocess — which would fall to the Commission for Social\r\nDevelopment to carry out — would also bring us to a\r\nglobal meeting in 2002.\r\nFor all these reasons, and bearing in mind that ageing-\r\nrelated issues and policies for older persons are priority\r\nconsiderations in our country, Spain has expressed its\r\ndesire, if there is a consensus on convening the Second\r\nWorld Assembly on Ageing in 2002, to offer itself as host.\r\nThis offer was included in the statement by our Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs in the general debate, and we reaffirm it\r\nnow.\r\nLastly, Spain believes that greater global attention\r\nmust be given to ageing-related issues in the various\r\ninternational forums. We should be aware that we are\r\ntalking about an issue that mainly affected the developing\r\ncountries when the International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing was adopted in 1982, but is increasingly\r\nbecoming a concern for all countries. These\r\nconsiderations are also behind our offer to host the\r\nmeeting in 2002. We hope that there will soon be a\r\nconsensus decision to accept our offer.\r\nMr. Nuanthasing (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic): Population ageing has not become one of the\r\nworld’s more alarming issues, and, if not properly dealt\r\nwith, the problem over the next century could be worse.\r\nAccording to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)\r\ndemographic data, the number of older persons aged 60\r\nor over is estimated at nearly 600 million this year —\r\n1999 — and is projected to grow to 1.9 billion by 2050,\r\nwhen the number of older persons will be as large as the\r\nnumber of children in the world.\r\nIn 1982, the World Assembly on Ageing convened\r\nby the United Nations adopted an International Plan of\r\nAction on Ageing. Furthermore, at its forty-sixth session,\r\nthe General Assembly adopted the United Nations\r\nPrinciples for Older Persons (resolution 46/91, annex). As\r\na basis for formulating national policies on ageing, the\r\nInternational Plan of Action and the United Nations\r\nPrinciples set a series of objectives and targets for the\r\nworld community to achieve in dealing with this issue.\r\nBoth the International Plan of Action on Ageing and\r\nthe United Nations Principles for Older Persons have been\r\naccepted by Member States as general guidelines for\r\nnational actions. However, different countries have\r\ndifferent ways of meeting the targets outlined in the\r\nInternational Plan of Action based on their economic,\r\nsocial, cultural and religious realities. In the case of Laos,\r\nour society advocates strong family ties. According to our\r\nculture and tradition, the family has the primary\r\nresponsibility to take care of its older members. By this\r\nwe do not mean that the Government has no\r\nresponsibility for older persons: on the contrary, as a\r\nmatter of policy the Government is doing everything\r\nhumanly possible to help families take care of their own\r\nolder persons.\r\n19\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nMinistries, provincial and district authorities and other\r\nGovernment bodies are also obliged to take care of their\r\nretired and older people. The Government has provided\r\nMinistries and provincial authorities with funds to build\r\nretirement communities. In other cases, the Government\r\nassists older people by supplying construction materials\r\nwhich they can use to build their houses as they wish. The\r\nnational pension is another source of income for older\r\npeople, and in public hospitals, older people also receive\r\nmedical treatment free or at reduced cost. Many\r\nachievements have been made, but much remains to be\r\ndone; the Government is determined to take further steps to\r\nenhance the quality of life of older persons.\r\nIn preparation for the observance of the International\r\nYear of Older Persons, a national committee was\r\nestablished. The Committee is composed of Government\r\nagencies — the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and\r\nthe Ministry of Public Health — and the Lao Women’s\r\nUnion, the Lao Front for National Construction and the\r\nNational Retirement Club.\r\nIn celebration of the International Year, in Vientiane\r\nthe Committee has organized seminars, conferences and\r\ntraining courses for trainers in caring for the elderly. At the\r\nbeginning of the year, a campaign of medical checkups for\r\nolder people was conducted in many cities around the\r\ncountry. Also a meeting and peace walk in honour of older\r\npersons, concerts and sporting events, handicraft exhibitions\r\nand shows of traditional Lao fashions were included in the\r\nprogramme organized this year in the capital city,\r\nVientiane, and in many provincial cities. All these activities\r\nare aimed at raising public awareness of ageing issues\r\nunder the theme “Towards a society for all ages”. Through\r\nthese events we very much hope to strengthen the\r\ninter-generational relationship in our society.\r\nThe celebration of the International Year of Older\r\nPersons this year provides a good opportunity for the\r\nMember States to cooperate closely with the United Nations\r\nsystem, to exchange experiences and to take home relevant\r\nideas and policies which can be realized in their home\r\ncountries. It is my delegation’s hope that the outcome of\r\nour two-day debate will contribute to efforts to formulate\r\nan action-oriented strategy on ageing for the new\r\nmillennium. In this spirit, all countries the world over\r\nshould unite their efforts and find effective ways to build a\r\ntrue society for all ages, a society that all people, including\r\nolder persons, can benefit from.\r\nMr. Satoh (Japan): At the outset, I would like to\r\ncommend you, Mr. President, for providing us with an\r\nimportant opportunity to follow up the International Year\r\nof Older Persons. I would also like to join in expressing\r\nsincere appreciation to Ambassador Alvarez of the\r\nDominican Republic, who played a major part in the\r\neffort to put the issue of older persons on the international\r\nagenda.\r\nWe are pleased to be able to celebrate the\r\nInternational Year of Older Persons in this last year\r\nbefore the new millennium. The theme of the Year,\r\n“Towards a society for all ages,” underscores the\r\nimportance of strengthening solidarity between human\r\nbeings of every generation, and this valuable idea will\r\nhave to be further mainstreamed in the new millennium.\r\nAs is often stressed, if the elderly are well cared for\r\nand empowered in the process of ageing, this could\r\nprovide a broad range of opportunities, both in\r\nindividuals’ lives and for society. The unprecedented\r\nincrease in longevity, together with technological\r\ninnovation and globalization, would make it possible for\r\nus to realize “active ageing”, in which older persons\r\nparticipate in a wide range of domestic as well as\r\ninternational activities. This would lead us to the\r\nrealization of a true “society for all ages”.\r\nWhat we have to do now and in the coming years is\r\nto maximize our efforts both in advancing the\r\nempowerment of older persons and in increasing\r\nopportunities for older persons to participate. Needless to\r\nsay, caring for older persons must be a central part of this\r\nconcept of a “society for all ages”.\r\nWhile Governments, central as well as local, must\r\ntake leadership in these efforts, the roles to be played by\r\ncivil society and volunteers as well as the media are\r\nessential for the success of this endeavour. Networking\r\nand partnership among these players and cooperation\r\nbetween them and Governments are critically important in\r\norder to realize a “society for all ages”.\r\nAgeing is an issue of increasing importance to Japan.\r\nOur society is ageing at an unprecedented speed, faster\r\nthan any other in the world. Today one out of six\r\nJapanese is 65 or older, and it is expected that in 2050\r\none third of the population will be 65 or older. And in\r\nsocial environments wherein parents and younger couples\r\nlive separately, caring for older persons is a matter that\r\nmust be addressed by society as a whole.\r\nIn order to cope with this issue, the Japanese\r\nParliament enacted in 1995 the Basic Law on Measures\r\n20\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nfor an Ageing Society, which provides for necessary\r\nmeasures to be taken, with independence and solidarity as\r\nguiding principles. Obviously, this reflects the United\r\nNations Principles for Older Persons.\r\nIn order to achieve the purpose of this law, the\r\nGovernment of Japan is now working to strengthen\r\npartnerships with local Governments and non-governmental\r\norganizations. The Japan Non-Governmental Organization\r\nConference was also established in October last year for the\r\npurpose of promoting cooperation among non-governmental\r\norganizations engaged in activities related to ageing. In\r\naddition, numerous events have been held by concerned\r\norganizations as well as by many local Governments during\r\nthis International Year of Older Persons.\r\nThe Japanese Government is also working to create a\r\nnew social security system of long-term care insurance\r\nwhich is aimed at ensuring the necessary services for those\r\nwho require long-term care.\r\nInternationally, the then Japanese Prime Minister,\r\nRyutaro Hashimoto, proposed the “Initiative for a Caring\r\nWorld” at the G-7 Lyon summit in 1996, with a view to\r\npromoting the concept of “active ageing”. Subsequently,\r\nJapan convened a series of conferences, including the East\r\nAsian Ministerial Meeting on Caring Societies, held in\r\nDecember 1997, and a meeting of high-level officials, held\r\nin January last year. Japan also sponsored in April last year\r\nan international symposium entitled “Health Initiatives in\r\nthe Asian Economic Crisis” in order to help alleviate the\r\nnegative impacts the East Asian financial crisis had caused\r\non health care in the countries involved. This was in\r\naddition to the financial support Japan had provided to the\r\ncountries hit by the financial crisis.\r\nJapan also provides training to officials from\r\ndeveloping countries who are responsible for the\r\nadministration of social security systems. In September this\r\nyear, Japan held an international symposium on “active\r\nageing” in Tokyo.\r\nIncreased efforts by us all are required in order for us\r\nto attain the goal of realizing a “society for all ages”. As\r\npointed out by the Secretary-General in his report, we have\r\nto pursue this goal from a multidimensional perspective,\r\ntaking into account not only the situation of older persons\r\nbut also life-long individual development, multigenerational\r\nrelationships and the interplay of population ageing and\r\ndevelopment. In this context, my delegation welcomes the\r\nongoing effort by the Secretariat to prepare a long-term\r\nstrategy on ageing, which will be discussed at the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\r\nJapan, for its part, is advocating that the international\r\ncommunity devote greater attention to human security as\r\nwe enter the next millennium. By human security, we\r\nmean protecting human beings’ safety and dignity from\r\nall sorts of threats, ranging from poverty, conflict and\r\nclimate change to drugs and infectious diseases. Older\r\npersons, who are vulnerable to each one of these threats,\r\nmust be the primary beneficiaries of this policy approach\r\nthat we are advocating.\r\nIn recognizing this, I would like to reaffirm the\r\ndetermination of the Japanese Government to do its\r\nutmost to create a society for all ages, both nationally and\r\ninternationally.\r\nMr. Chaouachi (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Tunisia\r\nis happy to join the international community today in\r\ncelebrating the International Year of Older Persons. My\r\ncountry welcomes the fact that 1999 — the last year of\r\nthe century — is being celebrated under the banner of\r\nsocial solidarity to promote a society for all ages. This\r\nyear is a milestone in making all the nations of the world\r\naware of the importance of the phenomenon of the ageing\r\nof the population. Tunisia associates itself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Guyana on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77.\r\nThe profound economic and social changes that have\r\ntaken place in the world during this century and the\r\nprogress made in science and technology, particularly in\r\nthe medical field, have had beneficial effects, improving\r\npeople’s lives and, in the past 50 years, increasing life\r\nexpectancy by 20 years.\r\nSuch longevity is new terrain for humanity, and we\r\nmust all explore and discover it together. We must\r\nprepare ourselves to confront this new challenge so that\r\nwe can promote good living conditions for older people.\r\nIn this context, the 1992 Vienna International Plan\r\nof Action on Ageing and resolution 46/91 of 16\r\nDecember 1991, which set out the Principles of the\r\nUnited Nations aimed at enabling older people better to\r\nenjoy their extended years, remain the preferred point of\r\nreference for guiding our policies and actions in this area.\r\nWe must ensure independence for older people, guarantee\r\ntheir full participation in social activities, provide for their\r\nneeds and foster their personal growth while preserving\r\ntheir dignity.\r\n21\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nTunisia would like to emphasize the existing link\r\nbetween ageing and development. We believe that it is\r\ndifficult to guarantee older people a tranquil old age in\r\nsocieties that are suffering from poverty and that, in\r\naddition, are being ravaged by armed conflicts and natural\r\ndisasters. In this respect, Tunisia calls for international\r\nsolidarity so as to put an end to the existing disparities\r\nbetween the rich and poor countries, between those with\r\nsufficient resources to provide their citizens with a happy\r\nold age and enough to live on, and those whose meagre\r\nresources are insufficient to meet adequately the many\r\nneeds of their people, especially the elderly.\r\nIn order to strengthen the bonds of solidarity, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Tunisia, Mr. Zine El Abidine\r\nBen Ali has proposed to the international community the\r\ncreation of a world solidarity fund, which would collect\r\nvoluntary contributions for development projects in the\r\npoorest regions.\r\nTunisia’s social policy gives priority to older persons.\r\nSuch an attitude is not new, and stems from the\r\nfundamental values that underpin our social fabric. Indeed,\r\nin our society, as in many others, older people have always\r\nbeen an invaluable resource to whom families and society\r\nas a whole pledge respect, love and affection. That attitude\r\nwas consolidated by law number 94-114 of 31 October\r\n1994, on the protection of older persons, which is a bill of\r\nrights for older people. It is designed to strengthen family\r\nsolidarity and home care for such individuals, improve\r\ninstitutional assistance to them and provide them with\r\nnecessary health-care coverage.\r\nMy country has implemented a strategy for the\r\nprotection of older people based on, first, ensuring social\r\nsupport through security funds; second, providing material\r\nassistance at home for those in need; third, providing\r\nmaterial assistance for families that take in older persons in\r\nneed who lack family support; fourth, creating mobile,\r\nmultidisciplinary teams to provide home medical care for\r\nolder people; fifth, implementing a programme to improve\r\nconditions for taking care of and protecting older people in\r\ncentres for the elderly; sixth, free treatment and hospital\r\ncare in public health institutions for all older people in\r\nneed; seventh, arranging for the creation and running of\r\nprivate facilities for the protection of the elderly; and,\r\neighth, setting up medical-school diploma courses in\r\ngeriatrics.\r\nIn the framework of its ninth economic and social\r\ndevelopment plan, which is currently in effect, Tunisia has\r\nalso set out a strategy to protect older persons. This consists\r\nof consolidating the activities of associations working\r\nwith the elderly, strengthening work in the specialized\r\nmedical and paramedical areas, validating the role of\r\nolder people by benefiting from their experience and\r\nknowledge and providing permanent assistance to 3,100\r\nvulnerable older people in the context of the national\r\nprogramme for the protection of older people.\r\nMr. Pennekamp (Netherlands): The Netherlands\r\nfully supports the statement made by the European Union\r\n(EU) Presidency. Allow me to make a national statement\r\nas a complement to that statement.\r\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, great changes\r\nare taking place throughout the world. Globalization,\r\ntechnological advances and an ageing population affect us\r\nall. The common factor in all of these changes is that\r\nthey have an impact on our economic, social and cultural\r\nstructure. By 2020, we expect there to be 1 billion older\r\npeople in the world, 700 million of them in developing\r\ncountries. But how will they — perhaps I should say,\r\n“we” — live? What will they live on? Who will look\r\nafter them? And how can we stop many of them from\r\nbecoming marginalized and excluded?\r\nAs we look at the economic and social developments\r\nin the world, the issue of a policy for older people has\r\neverything to do with their opportunities for social\r\nintegration, participation and independence. Of course, a\r\ncountry can deliver only the social welfare system it can\r\nafford. I agree with the World Bank that there is no\r\nstandard recipe. Little can be achieved without work, a\r\nsecure income, adequate housing and good health. None\r\nof those elements can exist without certain financial and\r\neconomic conditions.\r\nIn the Netherlands, we have shown that\r\nmarket-based economic policies and comprehensive social\r\nwelfare policies can coexist successfully and that they are\r\nin fact two sides of the same coin. If people of all ages\r\nare to be active members of society, we have to invest in\r\nan affordable pension system, housing, social welfare and\r\na health-care system.\r\nA competitive world does not have to be a world of\r\ngrowing inequality, social instability, and structural\r\nunemployment. Dutch policy demonstrates this clearly.\r\nLike many other countries, we have to cope with social\r\nproblems that primarily affect the more vulnerable groups\r\nin society, such as the frail and the very old. Fewer than\r\nhalf of the very old live in homes for the elderly; of those\r\nover 65, only 8 per cent reside in a home for the elderly\r\n22\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nor a nursing home. In our policy, living independently is far\r\nmore important than institutionalized care. Nevertheless,\r\npeople’s everyday problems demand specific remedies\r\nwhich, in the Netherlands at least, have to be delivered at\r\nthe local or regional level.\r\nThose who are in need of care or adapted housing are\r\nenabled to live independently thanks to well coordinated\r\nservices such as home care and adapted housing, or to\r\nvolunteers and informal care. All this entails a crucial role\r\nfor local authorities, local services and citizens in the\r\narea — of course, including older people themselves. In a\r\nsociety for all ages, people have to be able to participate\r\nfully, and should not have to not face discrimination or\r\nother barriers to obtaining work, income, housing or care.\r\nNo one should be excluded from society because of\r\ndiscrimination on the grounds of age, handicap or any other\r\nground.\r\nAge discrimination is the focus of much attention in\r\nthe Netherlands. At the national level, we do everything\r\npossible to fight it, for instance by supporting such\r\norganizations as the National Bureau against Age\r\nDiscrimination, and by setting non-discrimination as a\r\ncondition for financial support in fields such as sports.\r\nA society for all ages is all about people, both as\r\nindividuals and in groups. It is a society that encourages\r\nhuman achievement and promotes both social and economic\r\nparticipation and integration. To sustain a society for all\r\nages, we have to make long-term investments in our human\r\ncapital. In the technology-based society of the future,\r\neducation and the notion of life-long learning will be prime\r\nconditions for participation, for both young and old. To\r\ngive an example, one of the high points of the International\r\nYear of Older Persons in the Netherlands was Generations\r\nDay, held on the first day of summer. This was a chance\r\nfor young and old to meet, exchange thoughts and work\r\ntogether.\r\nBut the Netherlands Government is not concerned\r\nmerely with what goes on within our own national borders.\r\nPopulation ageing is a worldwide phenomenon that has long\r\naffected more than the industrialized countries. In many\r\ndeveloping countries, the standard of living has improved\r\ngreatly, thanks mainly to the efforts of older people\r\nthemselves. More people than ever are now living in peace\r\nand prosperity. Fewer children are dying; more people are\r\nsurviving into old age; and women now have more say\r\nabout how many children they will bear. These are all\r\nbenefits of sustained social and economic development.\r\nHowever, we cannot deny the potential gravity of the\r\neconomic, financial and social impact of an ageing world\r\npopulation. Solutions are not easy to come up with. Some\r\npeople regard this as one of the greatest challenges likely\r\nto face us in the first century of the new millennium,\r\nespecially in the many developing countries where the\r\nproportion of older people is growing much faster than in\r\nthe industrialized countries. In those countries, growing\r\nold usually means growing old and poor; only a few older\r\npeople have access to social welfare, and traditional\r\nfamily-based care for the old is steadily being eroded.\r\nEven in a highly developed social welfare system\r\nsuch as that in our country, we still need traditional\r\ninformal care. This is exemplified by the large number of\r\nvolunteers and informal care-givers active in this field.\r\nAnd since older people will continue to suffer from\r\nfailing health, we have to focus on providing them, earlier\r\nin life, with advice, preventive care, health education and,\r\nmost of all, access to basic medical services. Inspired by\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons, my ministry, the\r\nMinistry of Health, Welfare and Sport, and the Ministry\r\nof Foreign Affairs have submitted a joint memorandum to\r\nthe Dutch Parliament entitled “Ageing and Development”.\r\nThat document, summaries of which my delegation has\r\nmade available to members, aims to draw attention to the\r\nageing of the world\u0027s population and its impact on\r\ndeveloping countries. And it underscores the prime\r\nobjective of international policy on older people: their full\r\nparticipation and integration in society. Regard for older\r\npeople — and especially for the strengths, experience and\r\ncontributions that the elderly can give to society —\r\nshould be an essential part of our policy. That is why the\r\nDutch Government considers it important that we learn\r\nfrom each other how to encourage people to stay active\r\nin later life.\r\nLearning from each other\u0027s policies and best\r\npractices is potentially a very useful instrument. To make\r\nit work, the Netherlands Government is funding a United\r\nNations database, accessible on the Internet, containing\r\ninformation and public responses to population and ageing\r\npolicy issues in different areas. The annex to the written\r\nversion of my speech provides details on how to access\r\nthe database, which is at present under construction, along\r\nwith a sample of its content. I am fully confident that\r\ntogether we will make a success of it.\r\nUltimately it is not primarily for Governments but\r\nfor people themselves to shape this society which we\r\nhave come to call during the past thematic year a society\r\nfor all ages. The future is in their hands; unless people,\r\nyoung and old, have a chance to be active members of\r\n23\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nsociety, there is a real danger that their commitment will be\r\nstifled and that their valuable contribution to building a\r\nbetter society will be lost.\r\nMs. Wilson (Canada): Canada welcomes the\r\nopportunity to present a summary of Canada\u0027s record in\r\nrelation to the International Year of Older Persons. We\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on highlighting a variety\r\nof activities undertaken by Governments and by civil\r\nsociety, which provide useful examples for all of us. As\r\nwell, his report sets out in a comprehensive way key\r\nmarkers for future activities of the United Nations\r\nprogramme on ageing, offering useful guidance and\r\nchallenging ideas for future consideration. We also thank\r\nthose individuals and Governments that contributed to the\r\nexpert consultation and report.\r\nLike other rapidly ageing societies, Canada has an\r\nimportant stake in the International Year of Older Persons.\r\nOur senior population, which today makes up 12 per cent\r\nof Canada\u0027s total population, will account for close to 25\r\nper cent of all Canadians by 2041. The International Year\r\nof Older Persons has cast the spotlight on the challenges\r\nand opportunities of an ageing Canadian society. The policy\r\ninitiatives undertaken by Canada this year are part of a\r\nbroad, ongoing and forward-looking agenda begun several\r\nyears ago. That agenda builds on Canada\u0027s strong social\r\nprogrammes, which include a multi-pillared retirement\r\nincome system and a national health insurance programme\r\naccessible to Canadians of all ages.\r\nTwo years ago, Canada introduced reforms to the\r\nCanada pension plan that assure its fairness across\r\ngenerations and its financial sustainability for the future,\r\nwhile keeping benefits to pensioners fundamentally intact.\r\nIn February 1999, Canada was able to devote new resources\r\nto the health sector. Initiatives were introduced to\r\nstrengthen health services and to improve the readiness of\r\nthe health system for an ageing population. Important\r\ninvestments have been made to enhance the quality and\r\naccessibility of health services, to encourage the\r\ndevelopment and application of new technologies in health\r\nand to stimulate research on key health concerns.\r\nTo respond to the challenges of ageing, the federal,\r\nprovincial and territorial ministers responsible for seniors\r\nhave agreed on a national framework on ageing to guide all\r\njurisdictions and sectors in the development of policies,\r\nprogrammes and services for seniors. As part of this work,\r\nministers approved a set of core policy principles which\r\nwere inspired by the United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons and which were endorsed by seniors in\r\nconsultations across the country. These Canadian policy\r\nprinciples are: dignity, independence, participation,\r\nfairness and security.\r\nCanada\u0027s International Year of Older Persons efforts\r\ngot under way last year when our federal, provincial and\r\nterritorial Ministers responsible for seniors established a\r\nspecial body — the Canada Coordinating Committee for\r\nthe International Year of Older Persons — to oversee the\r\nplanning and implementation of initiatives across the\r\ncountry. The Committee included members from every\r\nprovince and territory, representing a broad spectrum of\r\nsociety, including aboriginal persons and persons with\r\ndisabilities.\r\nAmong the many initiatives undertaken this year,\r\nCanada was pleased to host the Fourth Global Conference\r\nof the International Federation on Ageing, which took\r\nplace last month in Montreal. This conference was the\r\nlargest ever, with representation from 60 nations,\r\nincluding ministers with portfolios dealing with ageing, or\r\nseniors, from 30 countries. The Montreal Declaration\r\nemerged from this conference. The Declaration reviews\r\nthe status of older persons around the world and reaffirms\r\nthe 1991 United Nations Principles for Older Persons. It\r\nalso calls on the United Nations to continue the\r\nmomentum generated by the International Year of Older\r\nPersons.\r\nThroughout 1999 Canadians young and old have\r\nworked together on events, projects and celebrations that\r\nare helping to establish a legacy of inter-generational\r\nunderstanding. Some of these will continue. For example,\r\nthe Generations CAN Connect project intends to build\r\nbridges between seniors and youth using information and\r\ncommunication technologies, including the involvement of\r\nyouth interviewing seniors about significant memories and\r\nposting them on the Internet.\r\nThe thrust of Canada\u0027s public policy for an ageing\r\nsociety is to ensure that our social programmes are\r\nsustainable and fair, and to promote good health\r\nthroughout the life course for all Canadians. We know\r\nthat we need to devote greater attention to reducing the\r\ndisparities in health and well-being affecting certain\r\ngroups in our older population, such as seniors with low\r\nincomes, older women living alone and aboriginal seniors.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nOur country\u0027s challenge for the remainder of 1999\r\nand beyond is to build on the momentum of the past nine\r\n24\r\nGeneral Assembly 23rd plenary meeting\r\nFifty-fourth session 4 October 1999\r\nmonths to ensure that the legacy of the International Year\r\nof Older Persons is a strong and enduring one.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker for\r\nthis meeting.\r\nI should like to remind Members that, as announced\r\nearlier at this meeting, statements for these four plenary\r\nmeetings should not exceed 10 minutes. In view of the\r\nlarge number of speakers on the list, I strongly urge\r\nspeakers to adhere to the 10-minute guideline.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n25\r\n"
